BACKGROUND
high throughput sequencing  has revolutionized our ability to analyze genomes for mutations that cause disease phenotypes. whole genome sequencing  can identify causative mutations in smaller invertebrate genomes such as d. melanogaster <cit>  and c. elegans <cit>  and also larger vertebrate genomes such as mouse and zebrafish  <cit> . however, most disease causing mutations are in exons, and wgs of vertebrate genomes remains relatively expensive compared to exome sequencing. therefore, for disease mutation discovery, exome sequencing is high-yield at a minimum cost.

to perform exome sequencing, exons are captured using arrays  <cit>  or in solution  <cit>  with specifically designed probes. since the exome represents <5% of genomes, a fraction of an illumina hiseq lane can generate sufficient coverage depth for confident variation detection. much more sequencing is necessary for wgs. exome sequencing has successfully led to discovery of mutations in polished genomes such as human and mouse  <cit> .

however, exon capture hts is limited by the quality of the genome assembly and annotation. for example, in x. tropicalis, a frog genetic model system, many of the exons have been identified, yet at least 5% of the genome, including exonic sequence, is in gaps in the latest genome assembly   <cit> . these difficulties also affect the analysis of zebrafish and other emerging model systems. in addition, even in polished genomes, a major challenge in the analysis of exomes is to identify a causative mutation amongst the large array of natural sequence variations present in the genome. in forward genetic screens, heavily mutagenized genomes have additional changes, further complicating discovery of causative mutations.

using x. tropicalis, we aimed to circumvent these difficulties by combining exon capture hts with bulk segregant analysis . in bsa, carriers of a recessive phenotype are crossed to produce wildtype and mutant progeny. these progeny are sorted based on their phenotype into two pools , mutant and wildtype. genetic markers  are then assayed on the bulk dna. if the bulks contain a sufficient number of embryos , then unlinked genetic markers will be detected as heterozygous in both pools. on the other hand, genetic markers linked to the causative mutation will appear homozygous in mutant pools but will remain heterozygous in wildtype pools. this loss of heterozygosity  in mutant pools indicates linkage and can be used to identify candidate loci. by combining data from bsa and exon capture sequencing, we can sift through the large array of sequence variations to identify a region containing the mutant gene. in polished genomes such as mouse, exon capture/bsa can be adapted to narrow candidate mutations in a single step at much lower costs than wgs.

xenopus is an extraordinarily valuable system for biomedical research, but forward genetic analysis only became effective with the introduction of the diploid x. tropicalis as a model  <cit> . employing forward genetic screens, numerous mutants have been identified  <cit> , but discovering the underlying causative mutations is difficult due to the relative paucity of genetic markers and limitations of the long-range genome assembly. despite these difficulties, some causative mutations have been characterized  <cit> . to facilitate the discovery of mutations in x. tropicalis, we sought to incorporate meiotic data into our exon capture hts by adding bsa into the sequencing step. we show that exon capture hts with bsa facilitates local genome assembly, genetic marker identification, and causative mutation discovery. using this method, we were able to identify candidate genes for two x. tropicalis mutants in just a few weeks. we then verified the identity of the mutated gene using either mrna overexpression to rescue the phenotype, or morpholino knockdown to phenocopy. in one case, gaps in the genome and local misassembly would have made mutation identification extremely difficult without exon capture/bsa. this method produces genomic resources inexpensively and can quickly identify candidate mutations amongst many sequence variations.

RESULTS
in a forward genetic screen in x. tropicalis, we identified two mutants, ruby and grinch that follow simple mendelian inheritance, show similar phenotypes, but fall into different complementation groups . both mutants appear wildtype until stage 38– <dig> when edema starts to appear around the heart, steadily worsens, and finally causes death by stage 46– <dig> . the etiology of the edema is unclear and could be due to cardiac, lymphatic or renal defects  <cit> . to determine the causative genes, we developed a hts approach combining exon capture with bsa. first, we developed an exon capture array containing coding exons identified in the published x. tropicalis v <dig>  genome  <cit> . because approximately 5-10% of the genome is missing from this assembly  <cit> , we also identified coding exons from available est clusters and full-length mrna sequences to augment the array.

we then captured and sequenced coding exons and flanking intronic sequence from dna of pooled embryos, in order to exploit bsa. hybrid carriers from our mutagenized strain  and mapcross strain  were crossed to generate mutant and wildtype embryos. two pools of these embryos were collected: one pool had only phenotypically mutant  embryos and the other had wildtype  embryos . we performed exon capture using our custom arrays and, using the illumina platform, sequenced each pool individually . we first analyzed the wt pool for heterozygosity, which identified snps in these populations. in mutant pools, we examined these same genomic positions for loh suggesting linkage to the causative mutation . our analysis identified over  <dig>  putative snps that were common across all mutant and wt pools, with a subset of snps becoming homozygous in the mutant pools.

for the v <dig>  genome assembly, we calculated a homozygosity ratio by dividing the number of homozygous snps to heterozygous snps per scaffold. we focused on scaffolds that had at least  <dig> snps per scaffold to avoid bias from falsely called snps . for grinch, these excluded scaffolds  represent less than  <dig> % of the genome, and for ruby, this represents less than  <dig> % of the genome. although this introduces the risk of missing smaller scaffolds that are linked to the mutation, this filter helped clarify and prioritize our analysis. when we had completed this analysis, the v <dig>  genome assembly became available so we repeated the analysis on this assembly. the v <dig>  genome assembly employed a preliminary x. tropicalis meiotic map as well as synteny to other genomes to create chromosome-sized super-scaffolds  <cit> . in this case, for all scaffolds larger than  <dig>  mb, we divided the scaffold into  <dig>  mb intervals and calculated the homozygosity ratio for these smaller intervals, again excluding intervals that had less than  <dig> snps from further analysis. this analysis identified scaffolds or genomic intervals with high homozygosity ratios indicating linkage to the causative mutation in ruby and grinch mutants .

cloning ruby phenotype
prior to this analysis, we had no previous mapping information for ruby. exon capture/bsa from mutant ruby embryos found six v <dig>  scaffolds with high loh signal  and a striking signal in scaffold  <dig> in the v <dig>  genome . using our newly identified snps, we sought to both validate our snp discovery and narrow down the interval carrying the causative mutation. for fine mapping purposes, we focused on snps that led to restriction fragment length polymorphisms  and found that 46/ <dig> snps  tested had the expected polymorphism. we then showed that three of the scaffolds from v <dig>   were tightly linked to the ruby locus, thus effectively assembling the scaffolds at this locus . analyzing the v <dig>  assembly, we confirmed that scaffold  <dig> contains the ruby locus and identified a misassembly of a portion of scaffold  <dig> . although we did not test markers on scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  , in the v <dig>  genome, both scaffolds are incorporated into scaffold  <dig> and therefore are likely linked to the mutation. scaffolds  <dig>  and  <dig>  may be linked to the ruby locus, but were not tested since we mapped ruby to a  <dig> kb or  <dig>  cm interval on scaffold  <dig>  using  <dig> mutant embryos.

this interval contains only  <dig> genes , and analysis of exon capture sequence revealed that three of these genes, il1b, psd <dig>  and pax <dig>  had sequence variants leading to amino acid changes or splice site changes. il1b had one amino acid change but was outside the mapped interval . psd <dig> had  <dig> amino acid changes that were all conservative. more importantly, the expression pattern of psd <dig> did not support a role in ruby, as there appears to be little expression prior to the onset of the phenotype .

pax <dig> had a mutation in the acceptor splice site of intron  <dig>  causing a mis-splice and frameshift, eliminating the entire paired-box domain . we confirmed this splice site mutation by rt-pcr and sanger sequencing . pax <dig> has previously been shown to be a principal and early regulator of pronephric development in xenopus <cit> . furthermore, mutant embryos had a reduced expression of pax <dig>  and defects in pronephric development as shown by pax <dig>  and several other pronephric markers  <cit>  . this is consistent with the edema phenotype, especially because the onset of the edema is shortly after the pronephros becomes functional  <cit> .

to demonstrate that pax <dig> is the causative gene for the ruby phenotype, we used an antisense translation blocking morpholino  to knockdown pax <dig>  injection of pax <dig> mo at the one cell stage caused a clear impairment of pronephric development in 59% of the embryos  phenocopying ruby mutants. in xenopus, we can target either the left or right pronephros by injecting one cell at the two-cell stage. when targeted to one side, pax <dig> knockdown causes impairment in pronephric development in  <dig> % of the embryos on the injected side . taken together, these results indicate that the phenotype in ruby mutants is caused by a pax <dig> mutation that leads to a truncated protein and disrupts pronephric patterning at early stages of development.

cloning grinch phenotype
similar to ruby, grinch mutants also develop significant ventral edema, but unlike ruby, grinch mutants have a ciliary defect that can be detected by reduced cilia-driven flow on the epidermis of mutants . scanning electron microscopy  also demonstrates fewer and abnormal cilia in multi-ciliated epidermal cells .

however, mapping the grinch mutation has been difficult from the start. grinch is a background mutation in x. tropicalis, identified in numerous unrelated animals from different labs. they all cause the same edema phenotype and based on complementation testing are at the same loci. this and the fact that the phenotype follows simple mendelian inheritance suggest a mutation at a single gene locus, with the possibility of more than one mutant allele. furthermore, preliminary mapping linked the grinch mutation to a  <dig> cm gap in the meiotic map on chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . scaffolds spanning the interval were unknown in the v <dig>  assembly, making traditional positional cloning difficult.

we employed exon capture with bsa to identify linked scaffolds. we identified nine scaffolds in v <dig>  that appeared linked to this locus . aligning our exome sequences with v <dig>  scaffolds, we demonstrated linkage to chromosome  <dig>  consistent with our previous mapping. we also found linkage to scaffold  <dig> and a portion of chromosome  <dig>  which indicates a misassembly . of note, the homozygosity signal in the grinch mutant pools was lower than for ruby .

we next sought to validate these scaffolds as linked to the grinch locus by meiotic mapping on a panel of mutant embryos. this again highlights the power of exon capture/bsa sequencing. with thousands of newly identified snps, some of which were rflps, we used meiotic mapping to create our own local assembly and fill the gap containing the grinch locus . we successfully amplified 14/ <dig> snps/rflps and  <dig> of them  had the expected polymorphism. fine mapping revealed that the interval containing the mutation is at the ends of scaffold  <dig> and  <dig> . both scaffolds share the ccdc <dig> gene suggesting that either these two scaffolds are overlapping or are adjacent with a local gene duplication. in the v <dig>  genome, ccdc <dig> is triplicated on three different scaffolds, chromosome  <dig>  scaffold  <dig>  and scaffold  <dig> . in addition, one other gene, ribosomal protein l <dig>  fell within our genetic interval. the other v <dig>  scaffolds  indicated by our exon capture/bsa analysis  are all assembled into scaffold  <dig> in v <dig> . therefore, although not tested by fine mapping, they are all likely linked to the mutation.

ccdc <dig> in x. tropicalis is an  <dig> exon,  <dig> bp transcript. mutations in ccdc <dig> were recently found in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia  <cit> . sem and transmission electron microscopy  images of grinch cilia show similar microtubule displacement as well as shorter and fewer cilia consistent with the human disease  <cit>  . to assess alterations in the transcript, we analyzed pools of mutant or wt embryos and performed rt-pcr using gene specific primers within the 5’ and 3’ utr regions. we then cloned and sequenced the pcr products. overall, 20/ <dig> clones from mutants have open reading frames that lead to truncated proteins. the remaining clone has a deletion of three consecutive amino acids . in the wt pool, which includes wt embryos as well as heterozygote carriers, 17/ <dig> of the clones are wt. of the two others, one has a premature stop codon and the other an internal deletion, which are both found in the mutant transcripts.

it is interesting to note that we found heterozygous snps in the mutant transcripts, suggesting two different mutant alleles . this was also confirmed in exon capture sequence and may explain the relatively low homozygosity ratios seen in figure 2d,e .

within the  <dig> mutant transcripts cloned , we found several different mutations, most of which show features of aberrant splicing leading to frameshifts and premature stop codons . 17/ <dig> of the clones  suggest a splicing defect between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  but neither genomic sequencing nor the exon capture data elucidated any obvious mutations in the splice acceptor/donor sites flanking or within intron  <dig>  grinch clones  <dig> and  <dig>  retain intron  <dig> although again, we detect no mutations in the genomic or exon capture sequences . clones  <dig> and  <dig> have a deletion of  <dig> bp within exon  <dig>  whether this is due to aberrant splicing is uncertain. we consider the  <dig> bp insertion in clone  <dig> to be a pcr and sequencing artifact since it occurs after a string of “a” nucleotides and has not been detected in any other clones . nevertheless all the mutant transcripts for ccdc <dig> are abnormal compared to wildtype.

to confirm ccdc <dig>  we attempted to rescue the cilia-driven epidermal fluid flow using mrna microinjection. we injected wt ccdc <dig> mrna along with a gfp tracer into one cell at the two-cell stage embryos. we assayed for cilia-driven flow over the surface of the embryo using colored beads and then genotyped the embryos. ccdc <dig> mrna injection rescued the severe reduction in epidermal flow in grinch mutants only on the injected side in 51/ <dig> genotyped mutants .

unfortunately, identifying the exact nucleotides mutated in grinch has not been possible despite exon capture or genomic sequencing. it is not clear if the mutant variants are due to more than one allele or a single allele that causes multiple abnormalities in splicing. however, taken together, mapping, transcript sequencing, imaging of cilia, and rescue are all consistent with ccdc <dig> mutation causing the grinch phenotype. given the complexity of the locus, exon capture/bsa was essential to identify this gene.

discussion
exon capture sequencing has transformed genetic analysis in humans and has demonstrated utility in mice. however, to date, exon capture hts has been scarcely reported in other genetic models  <cit>  despite the significant need to facilitate cloning of mutants identified in forward genetic screens. very recently, wgs with bsa has identified causative mutations in both zebrafish and mouse validating hts and bsa as an effective method  <cit> . for smaller genomes, such as yeast, worms, flies or arabidopsis wgs is probably cost efficient, therefore there is no need to pre-capture the exome. however, in model systems with large genomes, currently the cost of wgs remains relatively expensive compared to exome sequencing, especially for routine use in the large numbers of mutants. in addition, to maximize the power of bsa, depth of sequencing is useful to accurately identify snps especially given the challenges of unambiguously mapping short read sequences and sequence errors. in our mapping intervals, we validated ~90% of the snps identified by exon capture/bsa. finally, exome sequencing is high-yield since most disease mutations are in exons  <cit> .

despite the advantages of exome sequencing, a number of barriers exist including unpolished genome assemblies, partial genome annotation, incomplete or poor characterization of variations in strains, and incomplete inbreeding of strains. as a consequence, deciphering causative mutations from the sea of variants within an exome can be a significant challenge. there are also limits to exon capture sequence regardless of genome quality or model organism. exon capture sequencing only identifies exons and nearby flanking sequence so causative mutations deep in introns, promoters, or enhancers can be missed. also, insertions, deletions, and splice variants may be missed by exon capture sequence due to limitations in alignment software and short read sequencing. in each of these cases, linkage information can ameliorate these problems.

the identification of the causative mutation in ruby was rapid and the significant advantage of exon capture/bsa sequencing was that many variants could be eliminated, thousands of genetic markers identified, and a relatively narrow interval analyzed for a causative mutation within the exon capture sequence. no preliminary mapping is necessary and the meiotic interval can be narrowed based on available meioses.

in the case of grinch, positional cloning was difficult. the linked interval was not present in the meiotic map and misassembled in both versions of the genome. exon capture/bsa identified a large number of markers and scaffolds within the gap that allowed us to assemble the grinch locus.

however, we observed some heterozygosity at the grinch locus, suggesting more than one mutant allele. an additional allele could have been introduced since grinch was identified in numerous unrelated animals from different labs. they all cause the same edema phenotype and based on complementation testing are at the same loci. of note, the homozygosity ratios are lower for grinch compared to ruby. the presence of another mutant allele could explain the lower homozygosity signals since each allele may be associated with different snps and therefore appear heterozygous. alternatively, the mutant transcripts could be due to a single allele causing multiple abnormalities in splicing.

regardless, all mutant transcripts had either an internal deletion or a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon. alignment with other species shows that the c-terminus of the protein is most conserved, and we hypothesize that these truncated proteins will be non-functional. furthermore, microinjection of the wt ccdc <dig> mrna into mutant embryos was sufficient to rescue cilia-driven epidermal flow. thus, despite the complexity at the grinch locus, which would have made traditional positional cloning very difficult, using exon capture/bsa, we were able to identify ccdc <dig> mutations as causative of the grinch phenotype.

additionally, because exon capture/bsa is independent of the genome assembly, it can detect misassemblies. in fact, wgs/bsa experiments have identified unexpected linkage across disparate parts of the genome  <cit> . the cause was not further investigated in these studies so genome misassembly or inaccurate snp calling remain a possibility. in our study, we found evidence of misassembly in our exon capture/bsa data for both ruby and grinch and validated these misassemblies by meiotic mapping. once identified by exon capture/bsa, we can use meiotic mapping to reassemble the genome and continue fine mapping.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our study, we propose the following method to rapidly clone causative mutations in model systems with large genomes, such as xenopus, zebrafish, and mice. first, an exon capture array needs to be generated using exons from a draft genome assembly and/or transcripts from ests, mrna full-length sequencing, or transcriptome studies using next generation sequencers. second, exon capture sequencing of a wildtype pool is necessary if snps are not well characterized in the model system. as more individuals in a strain are sequenced, wildtype sequencing becomes less essential. third, exon capture sequencing in a mutant pool is done to identify regions of loh. exon capture sequence can then be analyzed for deleterious mutations in those regions. however, in more challenging cases where the loh interval is large or complex, we recommend validating linkage by additional fine mapping to narrow the meiotic interval further or reassemble the locus. lastly, once a candidate gene is identified, an independent validation is necessary such as a second allele, mo phenocopy, or rescue.

for model systems with large and unpolished genomes, exon capture hts with bsa can be critical for identifying causative mutations because so many genomic resources can be obtained inexpensively. the cost of hts is continuously decreasing and by using multiplexing techniques like barcoding, a single illumina sequencing lane can generate sufficient sequence at considerable depth for multiple mutants. this represents a considerable cost savings compared to wgs. furthermore, exon capture with bsa identifies a host of snps, facilitates local genome assembly, and discovers candidate mutations. this can be done very quickly  compared to the laborious methods such as chromosome walking across gaps.

for model systems with polished genomes, bulk segregant analysis and hts can rapidly identify candidate genes within a narrow locus all in a single sequencing step. finally, developing methods to rapidly and inexpensively clone mutants strongly encourages additional forward genetic screens to discover phenotypes and gene mutations that will yield fascinating new insights.
