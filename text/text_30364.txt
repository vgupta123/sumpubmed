BACKGROUND
following the discovery of micrornas  and the rna interference pathway in c. elegans  <cit> , and the realisation that small rnas are central to many aspects of plant and animal gene regulation, especially during development  <cit> , have led to the identification of thousands of mirnas in many species through deep sequencing-based approaches  <cit> . such approaches have also identified related small ncrnas including small interfering rnas  and piwi-interacting rnas  that are involved in rna-silencing pathways in somatic and germline cells, respectively  <cit> . moreover, recent advances in sequencing technology have increased the understanding of biogenesis of these ncrnas through deep-sequencing of size-fractionated rna fragments associated with particular proteins  <cit> , and also increased the amount of available short rna sequencing data dramatically.

analysis of such data has shown that mirna-sized short rna fragments are commonly derived from other small rnas, notably transfer rnas  and small nucleolar rnas   <cit> . indeed it is now evident that almost all snornas produce defined classes of small rnas that have characteristic sizes, origins within the snornas, and 5' nucleotide biases  <cit> , some of which may function as mirnas  <cit> . in analyzing such data we observed that many annotated snornas and other ncrnas are in fact covered with overlapping short rna tags across their full length, although most are derived from particular locations within the ncrnas. a similar observation was also employed recently for computational prediction of novel snornas in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . the observation of precursor coverage suggested to us that the profiles of overlapping short rna sequences might identify novel members of known ncrna classes and perhaps putative novel species of ncrnas. in this study we confirm this prediction by using assembled short rna sequences to identify one new snrna,  <dig> new box h/aca and  <dig> new box c/d snornas, as well as a number of novel ncrnas.

RESULTS
compilation of short rna sequence reads into tag-contigs
we obtained  <dig> , <dig> sequence tags comprising  <dig> , <dig> reads from  <dig> gene expression omnibus  datasets  derived from  <dig> experiments performed on drosophila cell lines and tissues. approximately  <dig> million tags were perfectly mapped to the d. melanogaster genome, excluding chrm , and chru and chruextra . each "tag" consists of one to many reads which reflects the number of times the tag was cloned and sequenced. for tags mapping to multiple locations on the genome, the number of reads of the given tag was arbitrarily distributed evenly to each mapping locus . the tags were then assembled into  <dig>  tag-contigs , comprised of contiguously overlapping  tags present in the same strand orientation  . as a measure of expression level, each tc was assigned a tag-depth score based on the maximum number of overlapping reads covering any part of the locus  .

the  <dig>  tcs, ranging from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt in length and from  <dig> to  <dig> in tag-depth, occupy  <dig>  mbp  of drosophila genome in total . several studies have identified sirnas and pirnas processed from transposons such as lines, dnas and ltrs, and correspondingly there is considerable tc coverage over these repeat elements . most exons  are also overlapped by tcs, possibly derived from messenger rna  . in addition, tcs identify  <dig> mirnas out of  <dig> annotated mirnas in the mirbase release  <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, although all deep-sequencing data were size-fractionated to 18- <dig> nt, which encompasses the size of mature mirnas, we found that some precursor mirnas  have most of their nucleotides covered by tcs . this is also observed for other small ncrnas such as snornas and trnas. most annotated box h/aca and box c/d snornas, trnas and small nuclear rnas  in flybase  <cit>  have overlapping tcs covering 70% or more of their length, and many are covered by single tcs that cover much of their length . moreover the majority of small non-messenger rnas  that have been experimentally validated as stable ncrna transcripts with as yet uncharacterized functions  <cit>  also have overlapping tcs .

*other  <dig> snmrnas that are associated with his gene cluster were excluded due to their repetitive nature.

tcs differ in their length and tag-depth for different classes of ncrnas
most of the tcs that overlap with well-characterized classes of ncrnas, such as mirnas, trnas and snornas, have particular length and tag-depth features that are consistent with the features of the corresponding ncrna classes. tcs overlapping mirnas show a high peak for the range of 20- <dig> nt in length , while tcs overlapping trnas and snornas have bimodal length-distributions . tcs in the range of 60- <dig> nt overlap almost 70% of all drosophila trnas. some of these tcs are longer than the mature corresponding trnas, which in drosophila fall within the range of 60- <dig> nt. this may well reflect the detection of uncleaved precursors  <cit> , as these extended tcs had high tag-counts that may have more sensitively detected such precursors.

tcs covering the full length of 53% of all annotated box c/d snornas and 56% of annotated box h/aca snornas  are within common size ranges of those two classes of snornas . the shorter tcs from trnas and snornas that comprise the peaks on the left-hand side of fig. 2b, c and 2d may indicate specifically processed short rnas  <cit>  .

fig.  <dig> adds another dimension to fig.  <dig> by combining the tag-depth feature with the length feature of the tcs within the typical size ranges of corresponding ncrnas  and clearly discriminates different types of tcs derived from different classes of ncrnas. tcs derived from mirnas have a wide range of tag-depths  as many mirnas are differentially expressed in different tissues or developmental stages  <cit> . tcs from the two classes of snornas have similar ranges of tag-depths to each other, while the tag-depths of trna-derived tcs are generally higher than those of snorna-derived tcs. there are also many unannotated tcs within the size and tag-depth ranges of snorna-derived tcs , indicating that some may also be unannotated snornas, as well as other tcs that could potentially mark other unannotated ncrnas. hence we explored the predictive potential of tcs for the identification of new ncrna loci.

filtering of unannotated tcs
for this analysis we excluded tcs derived from annotated exons, ncrnas, transposons or other repeats annotated in flybase  <cit>  . while most of the remaining tcs do not overlap other tcs on the opposite strand, a substantial fraction  of tcs have overlapping tcs on the other strand. the tag-depths of many of these are not particularly biased to either strand, causing ambiguity in transcription directions, which is characteristic of tcs derived from transposons   <cit> . in contrast, tcs for known ncrnas have either no overlapping tcs on the opposite strand or a strong bias in tag-depths towards the sense stand . thus, we further excluded tcs that overlap other tcs on the opposite strands and do not show significantly greater tag-depths than the competing tcs , and selected  <dig>  tcs for further analysis.

prediction of seven novel box h/aca snornas and one snrna
among the  <dig> tcs overlapping known box h/aca snornas ,  <dig> are within the size range of 120- <dig> nt, covering full-length or near full-length of box h/aca snornas. the tag-depths of those  <dig> tcs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  . we also observed that almost all annotated box h/aca snornas  are located in annotated introns in the same transcriptional orientation as their host genes, as expected  <cit> . thus, from the  <dig>  unannotated tcs, we selected  <dig> tcs that are  intronic ,  within size range of 120- <dig> nt and  with tag-depth of at least  <dig>  subsequent motif analysis identified  <dig> of these tcs that have the characteristic box h  and box aca motifs in the appropriate positions  <cit>  . blast analysis  <cit>  revealed that one of those  <dig> tcs, although unannotated in flybase, had already been identified as a box h/aca snorna  , providing a positive control for the analysis. it also showed that one tc at chr3r_1020733_ <dig> had a sequence that is almost identical to a snrna:u4atac: <dig> in drosophila simulans . considering that most snrnas in d. simulans were predicted from blast analysis with known snrnas of d. melanogaster against the d. simulans genome sequence  <cit> , the tc at chr3r_1020733_ <dig> is also a candidate snrna . the remaining  <dig> tcs were classified as novel box h/aca snorna candidates . interestingly, the box h/aca snorna candidate tcs tend to have higher tag-depth compared to the  <dig> tcs excluded due to the absence of motifs. the average and median tag-depths of the  <dig> candidates tcs are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, while those of excluded tcs are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

prediction of  <dig> box c/d snornas
a total of  <dig> box c/d snornas  are overlapped by  <dig> tcs , of which  <dig> are within the typical size range of box c/d snornas . the tag-depth of these tcs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  . since box c/d snornas are located either in introns  or in intergenic spacers, we selected those tcs from the  <dig>  unannotated tcs that are  either intronic or intergenic,  within the size range of 60- <dig> nt and  with a tag-depth of at least  <dig>  out of  <dig> tcs that fulfilled these conditions, we found that  <dig> have the characteristic box c  and box d  motifs in the vicinity of their 5' and 3' ends, respectively  <cit>  . one of these tcs, at chr3lhet_2398490_ <dig>  has been previously identified as a snorna  , again providing a positive control for the analysis. the remaining  <dig> tcs were considered candidate box c/d snornas . the average tag-depths of these candidate tcs is also much higher than those that do not have recognizable box c/d motifs -  <dig> and  <dig> for candidate tcs and excluded tcs, respectively, although the median tag-depths of those two tc sets are not significantly different from each other -  <dig> for both. blast analysis also showed that one candidate snocd_ <dig>  is highly homologous to a box c/d snorna, snord <dig> , in human and mouse  <cit>  , which subsequently also showed positive in northern blots .

tcs for putative ncrnas
after these box h/aca and box c/d snorna predictions,  <dig>  tcs still remain unannotated. to explore these further, we initially selected  <dig> highly expressed tcs with a tag-depth ≥ <dig> as fig.  <dig> shows that a large portion of tcs mapped to known ncrnas have tag-depths of  <dig> or higher. blast analysis further excluded  <dig> tcs that have sequences homologous to annotated transposons. the remaining  <dig> were classified into three groups based on their length and tag-depth:  <dig> tcs that are shorter than  <dig> nt with tag depths of  <dig> or more ;  <dig> tcs that are shorter than  <dig> nt with tag depths of 100- <dig> ; and the  <dig> longer tcs  .

the location of group  <dig> tcs is strongly biased to introns of genes involved in development  and with the exception of ncrna_ <dig>  at chrx_3721726_ <dig>  which is located immediately downstream of a trna-pro locus, all share a consensus  <dig> nt sequence , gtccacccgggggcgcca, which is also by far the most abundant sequence read within these tcs . genomic scanning for the 18mer motif sites found  <dig> more exact match antisense to the 3' utr of a gene of uncharacterized function . allowing  <dig> and  <dig> mismatches for the genomic scanning identified a further  <dig> and  <dig> sites, respectively , the majority of which are also intronic . one of the  <dig> motif sites with  <dig> mismatch and  <dig> of the  <dig> motif sites with  <dig> mismatches were found at the 3'end of trna:n <dig>  which indicates that this motif may have arisen from trna:n <dig>  however, none of the sequence tags contributing to the  <dig> tcs is mapped to the trna:n <dig>  suggesting that these sequence tags are produced independently of trnas. the  <dig> group <dig> tcs sharing the 18mer motif show high expression levels in s <dig> and kc cell lines, while the trna-associated tc has a significantly high number of sequence reads from the mid-embryonic stages .

*located downstream of a trna.

the  <dig> tcs in group <dig> are evenly distributed in introns  and intergenic spacers , and intronic tcs and intergenic tcs do not differ in tag-depth distributions. two of these tcs, ncrna_ <dig> and ncrna_ <dig>  were detected by genomic scanning for the 18mer motif derived from the group <dig> tcs when  <dig> mismatch was allowed. those two tcs along with ncrna_ <dig> are mainly composed of sequence reads specifically obtained from s <dig> cells  <cit>  . two other tcs, ncrna_ <dig> and ncrna_ <dig>  are composed of sequence reads heavily biased to adult body, larvae, and pupae .

in group <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> tcs were found to be derived from annotated ncrnas by blast analysis . those at chr2r_7292203_ <dig>  and chr2r_7292691_ <dig>  have recently been annotated as trnas-thr in the genomic trnadb  <cit>  and that at chr3r_2645849_ <dig>  defines 7sl rna precisely  <cit> , further demonstrating that this approach is able to detect various types of small ncrnas . we also found that a cluster of  <dig>  <dig> nt-long tcs located within a  <dig>  kb region, chrx: <dig> ,890- <dig> , <dig>  is part of an endogenous sirna cluster identified by czech et al.  <cit>  . each of the tcs in this cluster is an exact copy of the others and forms a hairpin structure which is the precursor of sirnas. the remaining  <dig> tcs are not particularly enriched in introns, but intronic tcs tend to have higher tag-depths than intergenic tcs .

experimental validation of putative ncrnas
for experimental validation of snrna and snorna predictions, we selected the snrna candidate along with top  <dig> and  <dig> box h/aca and box c/d snorna candidates, respectively, based on the tag-depth. the snrna candidate, all  <dig> box h/aca snorna candidates and  <dig> of the box c/d snorna candidates tested positive by northern blot  , with clear bands of the approximately expected sizes based on the length of tcs. the  <dig> candidates that were not experimentally confirmed have relatively low tag-depths  compared to the others , suggesting sensitivity problems and/or that the snornas are not expressed in the cell line or embryonic stages tested . in fact, while all confirmed snorna candidates have large number of sequence reads from late embryo  and s <dig> cells  on which the experimental validations were performed , the two unconfirmed box c/d snorna candidates have the highest number of sequence reads from early embryo .

*one of the  <dig> tcs in group <dig> that shares an  <dig> nt long sequence. †ncrna_ <dig> which is immediately downstream of a trna was excluded. ‡introns of  <dig> genes shown in table  <dig> 

we also carried out northern blots using the 18mer motif that dominates the tag spectrum in  <dig> out of  <dig> group <dig> tcs, and observed a strongly hybridizing band of approximate size  <dig> nt along with weaker  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt bands in s <dig> cells with a different distribution in late-embryo . we also observed larger  <dig> nt,  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt bands, the latter of which  may well be the result of cross-hybridization to highly abundant rna molecules such as trnas, given the extremely high gc content of the 18mer motif  and the high similarity to trna:n <dig> . in any case, the bands between  <dig> and  <dig> nt clearly suggest that the 18mer motif is expressed as small rnas, and is consistent with the incidence and size of the tags covering this motif.

a subset of group  <dig> tcs was also tested by northern blot. as the majority of tcs for known ncrnas overlap phastcons elements  <cit>   , we selected  <dig> intronic and  <dig> intergenic tcs that mapped to phastcons elements,  <dig> and  <dig> of which, respectively, showed positive in northern blots  . two exhibited clear bands of the approximately expected sizes based on the tc lengths, whereas the other four exhibited bands that are either shorter or longer than the lengths of their corresponding tcs . for the three tcs with shorter sized bands, ncrna_ <dig> , ncrna_ <dig>  and ncrna_ <dig> , the number of overlaying reads is very low in a few parts of each, suggesting that those tcs may represent unprocessed precursors . on the other hand, an intronic tc ncrna_ <dig>  showed a very weak band of approximately  <dig> bp , while its expected length was  <dig> nt . considering that this tc is located within a  <dig> nt long intron of cg <dig>  it may be that the actual transcript detected by northern covers the entire intron . the numbers of sequence reads for tcs with weak signals, ncrna_ <dig>   and ncrna_ <dig>  , were lower than those of the other confirmed tcs, and the most reads for those two tcs were obtained from mid-embryonic stages . this could be the reason for the weak signals from northern blot as is for the unconfirmed box c/d snorna candidates. the  <dig> unconfirmed tcs also have small number of sequence reads from late embryos and s <dig> cells, while most of their sequence reads are from early and mid-embryonic stages .

discussion
in this study, we utilized a strategy of analyzing millions of short reads from next generation sequencing experiments for the prediction of novel ncrnas of both known and unknown classes. although the deep-sequencing analyses used in this study focus on identifying shorter ncrnas such as mirnas, sirnas and pirnas by limiting the lengths of the rna samples to the sizes of such small ncrnas, assemblages of contiguously overlapping tags also overlap with longer ncrnas such as snornas, snrnas and trnas.

tcs derived from two different classes of snornas showed distinct features in their length and tag-depth distributions, and the use of these characteristic features along with the their signature motifs predicted novel snornas. proof-of-principle of this approach is provided by the successful recall of two previously known but not flybase-annotated snornas as well as the de novo identification of three known ncrnas  and an endogenous-sirna cluster. we also found that the majority of experimentally detected snmrnas  <cit>   are overlapped by tcs, another demonstration of the validity of the approach. in fact, one tc  overlapping snmrna: <dig> corresponds to the 7sk rna recently identified in drosophila  <cit> , the boundaries of which fit better to the 5' and 3' ends of the tc than those of snmrna: <dig> 

characteristic features of snornas were extracted from tcs that cover the full-length of annotated snornas. however, there are also many short tcs partially overlapping with annotated snornas, with strong positional preference in both 5'/3' ends of snornas, which is consistent with the positional preferences of snorna-derived small rnas   <cit> . these positional preferences were also observed and used for novel snorna predictions in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . we also found that these short tcs within snornas were closely juxtaposed. thus, more accumulation of deep-sequencing data would be expected to connect these tcs and identify more novel snornas. we also examined the potential of making a simple merge of closely located tcs but this approach was compromised by also merging adjacent snornas. chen et al.  <cit>  bypassed this problem in their snorna predictions by first anchoring the 3' ends of the novel snorna transcripts and then looking for their 5' ends. however, this method cannot be easily generalized for ncrnas of uncharacterized classes. alternatively, carefully designed computational approaches using the distribution of short rna tags across annotated snornas may also increase the number of novel snornas predictions. our candidates were tested by the snorna prediction software snoreport, which also refuses to use the modification target information of snornas  <cit> , but it identified  only  <dig> box h/aca and  <dig> box c/d snornas from our  <dig> and  <dig> snorna candidates, respectively. however, when we tested the performance of snoreport on the  <dig> box h/aca and  <dig> box c/d snornas that are annotated in the drosophila melanogaster genome, only  <dig> box h/aca and  <dig> box c/d snornas were successfully recalled.

unlike the prediction of box c/d snornas and putative ncrnas of uncharacterized classes, the box h/aca snorna prediction incorporated another filter that excluded non-intronic tcs. this was based on the fact that 92% of the known box h/aca snornas reside in introns, and reduced the number of predictions from  <dig>  to  <dig>  it is uncertain how many of the  <dig> discarded tcs  may be genuine box h/aca snornas, but the high validation rate of the intronic subset  indicates that the incorporation of the location filter improved the specificity of the prediction.

the length and tag-depth distributions of unannotated tcs are similar to those of exon-derived tcs , which may indicate that some unannotated tcs might be assemblages of degradation products of unknown exons. however, it is equally possible that they may also represent degraded or processed fragments of bona fide ncrnas that can also be re-assembled, as is evidently the case for snornas. moreover, the large amount of unannotated tcs located in introns and intergenic regions  indicates that there are many more unknown transcripts yet to be investigated. considering that we used a conservative threshold of tag-depths  for uncharacterised ncrna candidates as the vast majority of exon-derived tcs  have tag-depths less than  <dig>  the novel ncrna candidates shown in this study are just the tip of the iceberg. we tested  <dig> of the  <dig> putative ncrna candidates in group  <dig>  focusing on those that were most highly conserved,  <dig> of which returned positive signals in a restricted range of cells . however, considering that some ncrnas evolve at high rate  <cit> , the untested  <dig> ncrna candidates in group  <dig> could equally likely be novel ncrnas. indeed, among the total of  <dig>  unannotated tcs, only  <dig>  overlap phastcons elements, and, surprisingly, there is no apparent difference in the distributions of lengths and tag-depths between tcs that overlap conserved sequences and those do not . this suggests that while conservation may be used as a positive guide to likely ncrnas, the relative lack of conservation is not necessarily an index of lack of relevance of others.

in the experimental validation,  <dig> out of  <dig> selected candidate tcs were positive -  <dig> out of  <dig> selected snrna and snorna candidates  and  <dig> of  <dig>  putative unclassified transcripts of either group  <dig> or group  <dig>  this is a high rate of validation, given that the likelihood of detecting a signal in northern blots is dependent on the expression level of the candidate in the tissue concerned. in fact, the confirmed candidates have generally greater tag-depths than the unconfirmed , and they are also more contributed by tags obtained from late embryos or s <dig> cells  that were the source material for northern blots. in contrast, among the confirmed candidates, the tcs with weaker signals have a lower number of sequence reads from late embryonic stages than other confirmed candidates .

in addition, there remain a large set of ~  <dig>  tcs that overlap tcs on complementary strands, which is characteristic of tcs mapping to transposons. they are also closely located to each other , similar to tcs covering known transposon-derived sequences, and different to the ~  <dig>  tcs which were used for this study. we also observed that a large portion  of these  <dig>  tcs is found within reported sirna/pirna clusters  <cit> . although some of sirna or pirna clusters are not associated with transposons  <cit> , these preliminary observations indicate that some of these complementary tcs may be derived from unidentified transposons. in fact, about five thousand tcs in this set either slightly overlap with or are located close to  existing transposons have sequences homologous to transposons, suggesting they could be unannotated parts of existing transposons generating sirnas or pirnas.

CONCLUSIONS
several studies investigating the population of small rnas have yielded millions of sequence reads. in this study, we combined all publicly available sequence data from drosophila melanogaster short rna into hundreds of thousands tag-contigs and associated subsets of them with known ncrnas such as snornas and trnas. the characteristic features of tcs overlapping with known ncrnas were used to predict  <dig> and  <dig> box h/aca and box c/d snorna candidates, respectively, in addition to one snrna and many novel unclassified ncrna candidates, a substantial fraction of which were experimentally validated. we conclude that deep sequencing from short reads may be used to identify new members of known and novel classes of ncrnas, including those that are significantly longer than the reads themselves.
