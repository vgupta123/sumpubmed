BACKGROUND
the ap2/erf  transcription factor , one of the biggest gene families, contains a typical ap <dig> dna-binding domain and exists extensively in plants  <cit> . the ap2/erf domain is characterized by approximately 60â€“ <dig> amino acid residues that constitute a typical helix-turn-helix structure responsible for sequence-specific dna binding to modulate the target gene expression. based on the number of ap2/erf domains and the structural features, the ap2/erf family is usually divided into four subfamilies . the ap <dig> subfamily, containing two repeated ap2/erf domains, is comprised of two groups, the ap <dig> group  <cit>  and the aintegumenta group   <cit> . their main function involves the regulation of organ-specific growth and development, such as flower development  <cit> , ovule development  <cit>  and the formation of seed size  <cit> , by binding to target sequences gcacntcccang  <cit> . both the erf and dreb subfamilies contain a single ap2/erf domain with a specific wlg motif  <cit> . the erf subfamily can recognize the conserved nucleotide consensus sequence agccgcc of the gcc-box  <cit>  in the promoter regions of pathogenesis-related  genes and modulate their expression in disease resistance signaling pathways  <cit> , whereas the dreb subfamily typically binds to the cis-acting elements by the binding sequence ccgac and is involved in gene expression responsive to abiotic stresses  and plant hormones such as ethylene and aba  <cit> . the rav subfamily, containing a single ap2/erf domain and a specific b <dig> motif , is involved in regulating gene expression in response to ethylene  <cit> , brassinosteroid  <cit> , and biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . in addition, other members containing a single ap2/erf domain and lacking additional motifs are often named as soloist. little is known about their function. though the identification of structural characterization and the expression profiles for ap2/erf transcription factors has been extensively studied and documented in several plants such as arabidopsis <cit> , poplar  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , a holistic profile of the ap2/erf family detailing its structure and function in a given species is limited.

based on genomic sequences, the ap2/erf family has been characterized in arabidopsis <cit> , poplar  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and peach  <cit> . castor bean  is one of most important non-edible oilseed crops and its seed oil is broadly used in industry. in particular, the main composition of its seed oil is ricinoleic acid, which is considered an ideal and unique feedstock for biodiesel production . due to the increased demand for production of castor bean seed oils in many countries, breeding and improvement of varieties are drawing great attention from breeders  <cit> . further efforts should be made to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of growth and development. the recent completion of the castor bean genome  <cit>  provides an opportunity to identify and characterize the holistic profile of the ap2/erf family, which could add insights into understanding the molecular mechanism of the ap2/erf family that underlies the regulation of growth and development in castor bean.

a genome-wide survey and characterization of the ap2/erf family was conducted based on the complete genomic sequences of castor bean in this study. the expression profiles of the ap2/erf transcription factors among different tissues were examined using high-throughput sequencing for digital gene expression tag profiling . results obtained from this study provide global information in understanding the molecular basis of the ap2/erf family in castor bean and other plants in the family euphobiaceae as well.

RESULTS
detection of ap2/erf transcription factors in castor bean
in total,  <dig> putative ap2/erf transcription factors were identified  in castor bean, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length. the proteins encoded varied from  <dig> to  <dig> aa. according to the number of ap2/erf domains and their structural features, the  <dig> proteins can be divided into four subfamilies with  <dig> members in the erf subfamily,  <dig> members in the dreb subfamily,  <dig> members in the ap <dig> subfamily, and four members in the rav subfamily. like other plants such as arabidopsis, rice, grapevine and poplar, the erf and dreb subfamilies are the most dominant in castor bean. according to the classification criteria in arabidopsis <cit> , the dreb subfamily and erf subfamily can be further classified into six groups each. within the dreb subfamily the six groups  have  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. within the erf subfamily the six groups  contain  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively .table  <dig>

note: the names of subfamily and group were previously reported by sakuma et al. in  <dig> . the number shows the number of members in each subfamily and group.



compared with arabidopsis , rice , grapevine  and poplar , the ap2/erf family seems to have relatively fewer members in castor bean. it is obvious that the number of the ap2/erf members within different subfamilies and groups are varied among species . for instance, the number of members in the dreb subfamily ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the number of erf members ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in addition, one member  was identified as soloist, encoded by a single-copy gene with low similarity to the arabidopsis soloist at4g <dig> 

conserved residues in the ap2/erf domain
the featured sequences of specific domain regions within transcription factors usually determined the main function of a given transcription factor. compared amino acid sequences of the ap2/erf transcription factors from castor bean with arabidopsis, the conserved amino acid residues within ap2/erf domain were identified for each subfamily. based on multiple sequence alignments  <dig> conserved amino acid residues were identified in the dreb subfamily, including 4g, 6r, 8r, 11g,  <dig> k,  <dig> w,  <dig> v, 16e, 18r, 19e, 20p, 39r,  <dig> w,  <dig> l, 43g, 51a, 52a, 54a, 56d, 64g, 67a,  <dig> l,  <dig> n . twenty-three conserved amino acid residues  were identified in the erf subfamily . in the ap <dig> subfamily, the sequences of two ap2/erf domains ap2/erf-r <dig> and ap2/erf-r <dig> were highly variable because of a 10-aa insertion in the r <dig> domain or a 1-aa insertion in the r <dig> domain. however, the linker sequences between the two domains were highly conserved in the ap <dig> subfamily . in the rav subfamily, both the ap2/erf domain in the n-terminal region and the b <dig> domain in c-terminal region were highly conserved . in addition, two soloist proteins identified in castor bean and arabidopsis were highly conserved within the ap <dig> domain . in particular, most of members  in castor bean ap2/erf family possessed the two featured conserved elements yrg and rayd elements within the ap2/erf domain region.figure  <dig>

phylogenetic and conserved motif analyses
to examine the phylogenetic relationships among  <dig> ap2/erf members identified in castor bean, an unrooted tree was constructed using mega  <dig>  with the neighbor-joining criteria based on the alignments of full-length protein sequences. the generated phylogenetic tree formed  <dig> distinct clades  with well supported bootstrap values . it was clearly observed that four clades a-d composed the dreb subfamily, six clades e-j constituted the erf subfamily, the clade l formed the ap <dig> subfamily, the clade k made up the rav subfamily, whereas the soloist was separated. within the dreb subfamily, the six groups a1- <dig> categorized were able to be substantially identified. similarly, the six groups b1- <dig> categorized within the erf subfamily were also substantially identified .figure  <dig> 
an unrooted phylogenetic tree of the ap2/erf gene family in castor bean. the amino acid sequences were aligned using clustal w and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with neighbor-joining criteria. the names of groups  that have been reported previously are indicated. the letters  represented the main clades.



to dissect the evolutionary relationships of ap2/erf transcription factors between castor bean and arabidopsis, another unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino acid sequence similarity of  <dig> ap2/erf family members in castor bean  and  <dig> ap2/erf family members obtained from arabidopsis in previous study  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree generated four major clades . clade i was composed of the ap <dig> and rav members; clade ii covered all dreb members ; clade iii, clade iv and subclade ii- <dig> included all erf members; and the soloist was clustered in clade ii. further, it was also observed that subclades clustered by groups a1-a <dig> members of castor bean and arabidopsis within the dreb subfamily and by groups b1-b <dig> members of castor bean and arabidopsis within the erf subfamily were substantially identified, but the group b <dig> members were split in subclade ii- <dig> and other subclades within clade iii. in particular, all major clades and subclades were clustered by interspecies members, indicating that the ap2/erf transcription factors are homologous between castor bean and arabidopsis.

the amino acid sequences of ap2/erf transcription factors contained many conserved motifs which may indicate potential dna-binding sites or participate in activating the specific function of ap2/erf genes. diverse conserved motifs had been identified in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . to characterize potential conserved motifs embedded in the ap2/erf family of castor bean, the  <dig> complete ap2/erf amino acid sequences of castor bean were analyzed using the meme suite version  <dig> . in total,  <dig> conserved motifs were detected and named as motifs 1â€“ <dig> . it was observed that motifs 1â€“ <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> corresponded to the ap2/erf domain region, and the remaining  <dig> motifs corresponded to outside of the ap2/erf domain region. further, most of the  <dig> conserved motifs outside the ap2/erf domain region were nested in specific clades in phylogenetic tree. for example, the motif  <dig>  was shared by ten members and the motif  <dig>  was shared by  <dig> members in the ap <dig> subfamily; motifs  <dig> and  <dig> in the c-terminal region  were specific to the rav subfamily, and shared by each members in the rav subfamily; the motif  <dig>  was shared by a <dig>  a <dig> and most of a <dig> members in the dreb subfamily, the motif  <dig> was specifically distributed within the a <dig> group in the dreb subfamily; the motifs  <dig>  and  <dig> were shared by most of b <dig> members, and motifs  <dig> and  <dig> were shared by several b <dig> members in the erf subfamily. these observations indicated that most of conserved motifs were clade-specifically distributed or the members clustered together shared one or more conserved motifs, implying the distinct subfamilies or groups within phylogenetical placement may help in correlating their functions. the distribution of these conserved motifs within proteins of relevant clades in the phylograms was laid out in figureÂ  <dig> figure  <dig>

structural analysis of ap2/erf genes
structural analyses of genes revealed that all members in the ap <dig> subfamily genes had diverse introns ranging from three to nine, whereas  <dig> of  <dig> members in the erf subfamily,  <dig> of  <dig> members in the dreb subfamily and all the four members in the rav subfamily were intronless. only one was exceptional with a single intron in the dreb subfamily. the  <dig> members in the erf subfamily contained just one intron whereas the solosist gene contained four introns. further we inspected the pattern of intron positions for those genes containing introns. we found that the positions occurring introns were conserved in both the ap2/erf domain and the outside ap2/erf domain regions in the ap <dig> subfamily, though the number of intron was varied. similarly, most of genes shared same or similar intron patterns in the erf subfamily with most introns occurring in the ap2/erf domain regions . the pattern of exon/intron splicing phase usually provided useful information in understanding of the emergence and evolution of gene family. we checked the pattern of exon/intron splicing phase for each intron in the ap2/erf family. the splicing phases were designated as three splicing phases: phase  <dig>  splicing occurred after the third nucleotide of the codon; phase  <dig>  splicing occurred after the first nucleotide of the codon; and phase  <dig>  splicing occurred after the second nucleotide. results showed that most members in the ap <dig> subfamily shared same or similar pattern of exon/intron splicing phase, and the pattern of exon/intron splicing phase also was conserved in the erf subfamily .

gene structure analyses could provide additional evidence to support the phylogenetic groupings in a given gene family. our results provided strong evidence to validate our previous phylogenetic groupings. for instance, the five genes  categorized in the erf-b <dig> subgroup shared the same gene structure including patterns of intron position and exon/intron splicing phase ; the four genes  clustered in erf-b <dig> subgroup were nearly identical in gene length and structure.

recent researches have demonstrated that several ap <dig> transcription factors are regulated by the microrna mir <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> . to reveal potential mechanisms underlying the ap <dig> subfamily gene regulation in castor bean, we inspected the binding sites targeted by the microrna rc-mir <dig> identified in our previous study  <cit>  for each transcription factor in the ap <dig> subfamily. the targeted binding sites were unambiguously identified from four genes .figure  <dig>

expression profiles of the ap2/erf gene family
to investigate the expression levels of ap2/erf genes in different organs, high throughput tag-seq analysis was performed using five tissues leaf, root, seed  <dig>  seed  <dig> and endosperm . the raw sequence data of the five tag libraries obtained from illumina genome analyzer were submitted to the sequence read archive  under accession srx <dig>  in total,  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean sequence tags for leaf, root, seed  <dig>  seed  <dig> and endosperm libraries were obtained . to estimate our sequence quality and sequencing depth, the tag coverage and saturation was analyzed for each library . as showed in additional file 9b, when the sequencing counts reached  <dig> million tags, the number of detected genes tended towards saturation, meaning that our sequencing depth was sufficient to detect the expression of ap2/erf genes in each library.

after mapping these clean tags to the castor bean genome database, abundance of tags matching to each ap2/erf gene regions in five libraries was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. expression of only  <dig> ap2/erf genes was detected in at least one of five tissues tested, covering  <dig> members in the erf subfamily, three members in the dreb subfamily,  <dig> members in the ap <dig> subfamily and three members in the rav subfamily. of them, the expression of  <dig> genes was detected in root tissue,  <dig> genes in leaf tissue,  <dig> genes in seed  <dig> tissue,  <dig> genes in seed  <dig> tissue and  <dig> genes in endosperm tissue were detected . further, we expanded the expression analysis of ap2/erf genes using the gene expression database sra  submitted by brown et al  <cit> . as a result, expression of  <dig> ap2/erf genes was detected from brown et al.â€™s libraries. compared with our data, the expression of  <dig> of  <dig> genes was not detected in our libraries . most of the  <dig> genes newly detected from brown et al.â€™s libraries exhibited a very low expression . combined the two databases, the expression of  <dig> genes was, in total, detected.figure  <dig>

et al
. <cit> .



to understand the temporal and spatial transcription patterns of ap2/erf genes among different tissues, a hierarchy cluster in each subfamily was separately performed to visualize a global transcription profile of these genes detected from our five libraries. as illustrated in figureÂ  <dig>  only a few genes  showed a high expression across five tissues tested. most of genes exhibited diverse expression profiles among different organs. further, we combined our transcription data with brown et al.â€™s data  <cit>  to profile the expression patterns of ap2/erf genes in castor bean. similarly, most of ap2/erf genes exhibited various expression profiles among different organs. notably, most of genes exhibited a tissue/organ-specific expression, such as five genes  specifically expressed in leaf tissue, five genes  specifically expressed in root tissue, three genes  specifically expressed in flower, four genes  specifically expressed in developing seeds, and three gene  specifically expressed in endosperm. also,  <dig> genes, which exhibited higher expression levels in vegetative tissues  than reproductive tissues , were identified .figure  <dig>

further, we compared the expression profiles of ap2/erf genes among different organs between castor bean and arabidopsis. although some ap2/erf genes and their orthologs  displayed different expression patterns among tissues, most of ap2/erf genes and their orthologs presented similar expression profiles among organs between castor bean and arabidopsis . eight genes and their orthologs , for instance, were highly expressed in all organs tested in both castor bean and arabidopsis. in particular, most of genes and their orthologs exhibited a tissue/organ-specific expression profile. for instance,  <dig> m000440/at3g <dig> ,  <dig> m013668/at4g <dig>  and  <dig> m004094/at1g <dig> , were preferentially expressed in developing seeds and  <dig> m002846/at1g <dig>  was specifically expressed in flower in both castor bean and arabidopsis .

to identify potential transcription factors involved in regulating lipid biosynthesis in developing seeds of castor bean, we purposely analyzed the expressional differences of all transcription factors identified in castor bean  between seed  <dig>  and seed  <dig>  libraries. as shown in additional file  <dig>   <dig> transcription factors significantly up-regulated at the fast oil accumulation stage were identified. in particular, some key regulators of fatty acid biosynthesis, such as lec <dig>  lec <dig>  abi <dig> and wrinkled <dig> were significantly up-regulated, consistent with brown et al.â€™s observation  <cit> . for ap2/erf genes,  <dig> genes were significantly down-regulated, and only two genes  were significantly up-regulated at the fast oil accumulation stage  .

discussion
although the ap2/erf family has been broadly studied in diverse plants, the current study is the first report on identification and characterization of the ap2/erf transcription factors based on the genome in the family euphobiaceae, one important group of resource plants. in total,  <dig> putative ap2/erf family genes were identified based on the genome sequences of castor bean. genome analyses showed that castor bean had undergone recent duplication events  <cit> , which might contribute to the expansion of the ap2/erf family in castor bean. compared with arabidopsis , rice , grapevine  and poplar , castor bean  harbored the minimum members in the ap2/erf family . as mentioned above, the ap2/erf family was extensively involved in regulating plant response to diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. castor bean can easily grow in diverse habitats from template, subtropical to tropical areas. it appears that castor bean displays a strong tolerance or resistance to diverse environmental stresses. however, why castor bean harbors less members in the ap2/erf family is yet unknown. the  <dig> members identified were unambiguously divided into four subfamilies, in consistence with the category of ap2/erf family in other plants. in particular, both erf and dreb are dominant subfamilies containing a single ap2/erf domain in structure, whereas both ap <dig> and rav subfamilies were of minority exhibiting a more complex gene structure such as two ap2/erf domains and more introns or a specific b <dig> motif in gene sequences. probably, an early addition of introns or a second dna binding domain in structure may have impaired the duplicative ability of the hypothesized ancestral hnh endonuclease in the early evolution of this family, or a longer piece of dna might have made a transposition and duplication event less likely, resulting in the smaller number of members in the ap <dig> and rav subfamilies  <cit> . in addition, similar to other plants  <cit> , the ap2/erf domain regions contained many highly conserved amino acid residues in castor bean.

in general, transcription factors functionally result from some important conserved motifs within and outside the dna binding domain which are related to transcriptional activity, nuclear localization, and protein-protein interactions  <cit> . two conserved amino acid residues  <dig> v/a and 19e/d within the ap2/erf domain have been proved to be critical for dna-binding specificity  <cit> . the identified divergence of amino acid residues  <dig> v and 19e in the dreb subfamily, or 14a and 19d in the erf subfamily may be one of the important factors in the understanding of the functional divergence between the erf and dreb subfamilies in castor bean. in particular, the two elements yrg and rayd within the ap2/erf domain had been reported to be critical in activating dna binding to modulate the expression of target genes in arabidopsis <cit> . the two elements yrg and rayd were highly conserved and identified in most of the members of ap2/erf family in castor bean, implying their structural and functional necessity. outside the ap2/erf domain regions  <dig> conserved motifs were identified in castor bean ap2/erf family in this study. most of these conserved motifs display a group-specific distribution pattern. combining the structural differentiation of genes among subfamilies or groups, these observations strongly imply that the functional divergence exists among subfamilies or groups. the conserved motifs  <dig> and  <dig> may play important roles as transcriptional repressor in mediating plant growth and development  <cit> . both motifs  <dig> and  <dig> were the rav subfamily specific, and shared by each member, implying that motifs  <dig> and  <dig> may be indispensable elements in structure of rav subfamily in castor bean. studies have showed that motifs  <dig> and  <dig> could form a long linker of the two Î²-sheets and these extruded residues or of ap2/erf proteins and several linker residues in ant lineage in arabidopsis, which may participate in activating the function of transcription factors in the ap <dig> subfamily  <cit> . both motifs  <dig> and  <dig> were the ap <dig> subfamily specific in castor bean, shared by  <dig> and  <dig> members respectively, meaning that motifs  <dig> and  <dig> may provide a specific function for dna binding in the ap <dig> subfamily in castor bean. the motif  <dig> was shared by  <dig> members from groups a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> in the dreb subfamily, characterized by four blocks of conserved amino acid residues: lprp, dqaa/dir, lraa and lnfp . these conserved amino acid residues have been identified to be essential signatures in arabidopsis for cbl-interacting serine/threonine-proteins kinase- <dig>  <cit> , ethylene-responsive transcription factor erf <dig>  <cit> , dehydration responsive element binding proteins-1c and proteins-g  <cit> , auxin response factor- <dig>  <cit> , and disease resistance  <cit> , respectively. the motif  <dig> containing a unique â€˜edllâ€™ residue was the group b <dig> specific in erf subfamily . the â€˜edllâ€™ residue might participate in activating the function for the group b <dig> members in the erf subfamily  <cit> . however, the function of most conserved motifs identified in castor bean is uncertain. compared those additional conserved motifs identified outside of the ap2/erf domain regions in castor bean with other plants, eight motifs  were shared by castor bean, arabidopsis and rice, indicating most of additional motifs outside of ap2/erf domain regions were conserved in plants. the newly identified seven motifs  might be variable among species or species-specific in castor bean.

phylogenetic analysis of the ap2/erf transcription factors in castor bean showed that the four subfamilies, ap <dig>  rav, dreb, erf, and the main groups a1-a <dig> within the dreb subfamily, and groups b1-b <dig> within the erf subfamily were able to be substantially identified. compared with the phylogenetical relationships of the ap2/erf members in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , phylograms displayed similar clades to our results. the phylogenetical tree generated by the combined members between castor bean and arabidopsis showed a major clade i shared by the ap <dig> and rav members, indicating a phylogenetically close relationship between the ap <dig> and rav subfamilies. in particular, all major clades and subclades were clustered by interspecies members, indicating that the ap2/erf transcription factors are homologous between castor bean and arabidopsis. based on similar gene structure and conserved motifs of ap2/erf gene in different species, it was indicated that the ap2/erf transcription factors were highly conserved in angiosperm. these observations strongly support magnani et al.â€™s assumption that the ap2/erf transcription factors might have an ancient origin during angiosperm evolution  <cit> .

as mentioned above, researches have demonstrated that the activities of several ap <dig> transcription factors are regulated during the development of organs by the microrna mir <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> . our current study identified four ap <dig> genes containing unambiguous targeted sites for binding rc-mir <dig>  which could provide a potential clue to dissect the mechanisms underlying the ap <dig> gene regulation in castor bean.

although our sequencing depth was sufficient, high throughput tag-seq data obtained from five libraries identified the expression of only  <dig> ap2/erf genes in this study. based on the deep rna-seq data in previous study  <cit> , the expressions of additional  <dig> ap2/erf genes were supplemented. the expressional differences of ap2/erf genes between our data and brown et alâ€™s data could be explained because of 1) the different sequencing strategy and depth ; 2) the different tissues tested . the expression profiles of most ap2/erf genes displayed spatial and temporal expression patterns among different tissues, implying their functional specificity. for example, the  <dig> m <dig> gene was specifically expressed in root tip tissues, and its homologs  in arabidopsis were functionally involved in regulating the growth and development of root tips  <cit> . in addition, the expression of  <dig> of  <dig> ap2/erf genes  were not detected . the possible reasons include: 1) the limited tissues or developmental stages were examined in our analysis, and 2) the tissues tested in both our current examination and brown et alâ€™s study were sampled from individuals with normal growth . it is understandable that the expression of some genes in dreb and erf subfamilies would not be detected if their expressions were majorly involved in responding to biotic and abiotic stresses.

one of main objectives of this study is to identify potential ap2/erf transcription factors involved in oil accumulation or seed development of castor bean. the analyses of expressional differences between seed  <dig> and seed  <dig> libraries revealed that  <dig> of  <dig> ap2/erf genes were down-regulated from the initial developing stage to the oil fast accumulation stage. these genes might be negatively regulated in oil accumulation in the developing seeds of castor bean. for the two genes  strongly up-regulated at the oil fast accumulation stage, we inspected the function of their the homologs  in arabidopsis and found that at1g <dig> was a hypoxia-inducible ethylene response factor and significantly up-regulated in developing seeds , and at3g <dig>  was a master gene responsible for transcriptionally regulating carbon metabolism and lipid biosynthesis in developing seeds . potentially, the gene  <dig> m <dig> may be an important transcription factor responsible for regulating oil accumulation in developing seeds of castor bean. studies focusing on the functional analysis of  <dig> m <dig> might reveal the mechanism underlying the regulation of oil accumulation in developing seeds of castor bean.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study is the first report on identification and characterization of the ap2/erf transcription factors based on the castor bean genome in the family euphobiaceae. in total,  <dig> putative ap2/erf family genes were identified in castor bean, one of most important non-edible oilseed crops and its seed oil is broadly used for industrial applications. further, the  <dig> ap2/erf transcription factors were characterized according to the conserved amino acid residues within ap2/erf domain, the conserved motifs and gene organization in structure, phylogenetical analysis, and global expression profiles among different tissues using high-throughput sequencing. results obtained from this study provide global information in understanding the molecular basis of the ap2/erf family in castor bean.
