BACKGROUND
alfalfa is the most widely cultivated forage legume, with a global production area of 11– <dig> million ha  <cit> . in the united states, alfalfa is the fourth most widely produced crop  <cit> , contributing more than $ <dig> billion annually to the u.s. farm economy  <cit> . alfalfa produces high dry matter yields; 18–23 mg/ha in the irrigated western u.s. and 7–14 mg/ha in rain fed areas of the eastern and midwestern u.s. the crop is primarily used as feed in dairy cow, sheep, and beef production systems as dried hay, haylage, and for grazing. it is an excellent source of crude protein, vitamins, minerals, and the dietary fiber needed to maintain rumen health. moreover, alfalfa contributes to the financial security of farmers by providing soil nitrogen  for subsequent crops in a rotation system due to its symbiotic n <dig> fixation capacity. additionally, because alfalfa is a perennial crop, it provides numerous agro-ecological advantages including reduced soil erosion, improved soil carbon sequestration, and increased capture of nutrients from annual cropping fields to protect surface and ground water resources.

most modern alfalfa cultivars grown in the u.s. are a result of introgression of medicago sativa ssp. falcata and m. sativa ssp. sativa. the two subspecies readily hybridize although they have distinct phenotypes and geographic origins  <cit> . m. sativa ssp. falcata originated in central asia and is characterized by orange-yellow flowers , straight to sickle-shaped seedpods, broad crowns, creeping-root habit, and extreme winter hardiness. both diploid and autotetraploid accessions occur naturally. m. sativa ssp. sativa is an autotetraploid that originated in the near east, with iran as the geographic center of origin. m. sativa ssp. sativa has violet or lavender colored flowers , coiled seed pods, and is adapted to temperate regions. both subspecies suffer from severe inbreeding depression when self-pollinated and are therefore bred as cross-pollinated synthetic cultivars. for this study, clones of one individual from each subspecies, m. sativa ssp. sativa  and m. sativa ssp. falcata , were selected for analysis. these lines exhibited superior performance when used as female parents in experiments to evaluate m. sativa ssp. falcata x m. sativa ssp. sativa semi-hybrids for enhancing forage yield .fig.  <dig> phenotypes of medicago sativa ssp. falcata and medicago sativa ssp. sativa. a recumbent stem architecture and  flower raceme of medicago sativa ssp. falcata . c upright stem architecture and  flower raceme of medicago sativa ssp. sativa 



yield improvement in forage crops during the past century has lagged behind that of annual grain crops  <cit> . as an outcrossing tetraploid, genetic analysis of alfalfa is particularly difficult. despite studies using  <dig> sequencing to identify snps  <cit> , the development of an alfalfa snp array  <cit> , and the use of genotype by sequencing to develop an alfalfa linkage map  <cit>  there is an overall paucity of genetic information and genomic resources that can be readily utilized by alfalfa breeders for alfalfa improvement. gene expression atlases have been produced for a number of plants including arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> , oryza sativa   <cit> , glycine max   <cit> , phaseolus vulgaris   <cit> , and medicago truncatula  <cit> . these have proven invaluable tools for understanding plant gene expression due to genome duplication, response to diverse environmental conditions, plant development, and pest and pathogen interactions . due to the close genetic relationship between m. truncatula and m. sativa, researchers have utilized the m. truncatula affymetrix genechip to measure gene expression in homologous genes  <cit> . however, the genetic complexity of m. sativa severely limits this approach. microarray technology is also constrained by prior knowledge of gene sequences, limiting the patterns of gene expression to a subset of the total transcriptional activity of an organism. as a result, microarrays provide only a fragmented picture of transcript accumulation patterns.

next-generation sequencing has facilitated the development of transcriptome sequences prior to genome sequencing in several legume crop species including lentil  <cit> , lupin  <cit> , pea  <cit> , pigeonpea  <cit> , and red clover  <cit> . rna-seq has been used for gene annotation, expression analysis, and snp discovery. this methodology has also proven useful for discovery of novel transcripts  and identification of alternative splice variants. the illumina rna-seq platform allows for transcript identification and measurement of transcript abundance. it also has the advantage of higher sensitivity and greater dynamic range of expression than microarray-based technologies. several illumina-based rna-seq studies have been performed in alfalfa though transcriptome analyses were limited to stems  <cit> , roots  <cit> , shoots and roots  <cit> , or were confined to a single cultivar  <cit> .

the objectives of this research were to expand the available transcriptome data and develop an expression atlas for alfalfa that is accessible using a web-based interface for gene discovery and identification of molecular markers for alfalfa improvement. the atlas is based on a de novo transcriptome assembly  for m. sativa ssp. sativa  and m. sativa ssp. falcata  using samples from roots, nitrogen-fixing root nodules, leaves, flowers, elongating stem internodes, and post-elongation stem internodes. the transcriptome assembly increases the expressed sequence data available for alfalfa by more than ninefold. in particular, the atlas provides the first transcriptome analysis from alfalfa root nodules. the alfalfa gene atlas data should prove useful in identifying genes and for delimiting intron and exon boundaries from genomic sequence. here, we report transcripts differentially expressed between the two subspecies and tissue samples, and single nucleotide polymorphisms  that differ between b <dig> and f <dig>  we provide specific examples of the utility of the expression atlas for candidate gene identification. comparing transcript abundance we identified specific expression differences for sequences potentially involved in cold tolerance, sequences in the anthocyanin and carotenoid synthesis pathways involved in yellow and purple flower pigmentation, cell wall related sequences differentially expressed between the two subspecies, and nodule-specific sequences unique to alfalfa. the entirety of the dataset has been assembled into the alfalfa gene index and expression database , which is publicly available for download and exploration at http://plantgrn.noble.org/aged/.

RESULTS
de novo transcriptome assembly
the msgi  <dig>  transcriptome assembly consists of  <dig>  unique sequences . on average,  <dig>  million 76 bp reads were generated for each cdna library  and 84 % of the reads generated mapped to the msgi  <dig>  assembly. the average msgi  <dig>  contig size is  <dig>  bp, with the largest contig spanning  <dig>  bp . the assembly provides  <dig> ,272 bp of alfalfa sequence, a significant increase in the publicly available sequence data for this crop. the msgi  <dig>  transcriptome represents 19 % of the predicted  <dig> mbp m. sativa genome, which is double the percentage of the m. truncatula genome predicted to be transcriptionally active   <cit> , but less than that of arabidopsis   <cit> .fig.  <dig> distribution of transcript lengths in the medicago sativa gene index  <dig> . the de novo transcriptome was built from 76-bp single-end read sequences from three biological replicates of six tissues  isolated from medicago sativa ssp. falcata  and m. sativa ssp. sativa  using velvet/oases, cd-hit, and cap <dig>  the medicago sativa gene index  <dig>   is composed of  <dig>  unique sequences ranging from 100 bp to  <dig>  bp



sequencing transcripts from multiple tissues and subspecies netted a greater overall coverage of the m. sativa transcriptome , than either single tissue analyses from multiple alfalfa cultivars  or from multiple tissue samples from a single alfalfa cultivar  <cit> . sequencing of stems from  <dig> different alfalfa genotypes by li et al.  <cit> , resulted in the assembly of  <dig>  contigs. sequencing from  <dig> different tissues by liu et al.  <cit> , resulted in the assembly of  <dig>  contigs. sequencing of roots and shoots from m. truncatula ssp sativa var. chilean and m. truncatula ssp falcata var. wisfal resulted in the assembly of  <dig>  sequences, though  <dig> technology precluded expression analysis  <cit> . future transcript profiling experiments in alfalfa focusing on plant samples from multiple genotypes, stages of development, and under biotic and abiotic stress conditions may provide a more thorough alfalfa transcriptome.

annotations and functional classifications
putative annotations for msgi  <dig>  sequences were assigned using blastx searches  <cit>  against predicted proteins from seven phytozome  angiosperm clade anchor species and the uniprot knowledgebase  <cit>   . this approach assigned tentative annotations to  <dig>  transcripts  . of the phytozome angiosperm clade anchor species, m. truncatula proved most similar to the msgi  <dig>  sequences, providing annotations for  <dig>  sequences in the de novo assembly. the  <dig>  msgi  <dig>  sequences annotated by m. truncatula corresponded to 70 % of the msgi  <dig>  assembly. m. truncatula genes and homologous msgi  <dig>  sequences were visualized on the m. truncatula chromosomes  to ensure the msgi  <dig>  sequences were evenly distributed across the m. truncatula genome . this visualization identified a number of regions on the m. truncatula genome with a significant increase in msgi  <dig>  sequences , the majority of which are involved in defense responses. restricting the blast analysis to arabidopsis for gene ontology  associations identified  <dig>  msgi  <dig>  sequences  with an arabidopsis homolog.

alfalfa transcripts corresponding to all protein encoding genes in the two m. sativa subspecies were compared to the predicted transcriptomes  of the related legumes m. truncatula, soybean  and common bean . soybean has undergone a whole genome duplication event not shared by common bean  <cit> . similarly, the transcriptome of alfalfa  is expected to be twice that of m. truncatula . blastx  <cit>  with an e-value cutoff of 1e- <dig> was used to compare the primary transcripts of soybean, p. vulgaris, m. truncatula and the msgi  <dig>  assembly to predicted proteins in the arabidopsis genome . when we compared p. vulgaris and soybean to arabidopsis,  <dig>  of p. vulgaris transcripts and  <dig>  of soybean transcripts had a hit to a predicted arabidopsis proteins, clearly reflecting the whole genome duplication event in soybean . similarly, when we compared the msgi  <dig>  assembly and m. truncatula transcripts to arabidopsis,  <dig>  msgi  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  m. truncatula transcripts had a hit to a predicted arabidopsis protein. given that 85 % of transcripts in msgi  <dig>  are expressed in both b <dig> and f <dig>  and a similar number of unique arabidopsis genes were identified for each of the legume species, our data confirms the msgi  <dig>  assembly is complete and the transcriptome of m. sativa is twice the size of m. truncatula.table  <dig> blast analyses to arabidopsis confirm a genome duplication event in m. sativa


p. vulgaris
g. max
m. truncatula
m. sativa
the primary transcripts of phaseolus vulgaris, glycine max, medicago truncatula, and medicago sativa  were compared to the  <dig>  predicted primary proteins of arabidopsis using blastx with an e-value cutoff of 1e- <dig>  the ratio of transcripts from each legume species that match an arabidopsis protein clearly reflects a whole genome duplication event in g. max relative to p. vulgaris and a polyploidy event in m. sativa relative to m. truncatula. a similar number of unique arabidopsis sequences were identified from the blast report for each legume, confirming the breadth of the m. sativa assembly



to evaluate the breadth of gene function across the msgi  <dig>  assembly, we compared the gene ontology   <cit>  slim annotations of the msgi  <dig>  assembly and the primary transcripts of m. truncatula, soybean, and p. vulgaris. the total number of transcripts associated with each biological process  go slim term is approximately 2-fold greater for m. sativa and g. max than for m. truncatula and p. vulgaris . these results provide additional evidence of genome duplication event in soybean and a polyploid event in m. sativa. the percentage of transcripts within each bp go slim annotation is similar in all four legumes  confirming the msgi  <dig>  assembly encompasses the majority of transcripts in the m. sativa genome.fig.  <dig> gene ontology analyses of legume transcripts confirm the breadth of the m. sativa transcript assembly. a total number of transcripts in msgi  <dig>  m. truncatula, g. max, and p. vulgaris with biological process  gene ontology  slim annotations. the 2-fold difference in transcript number reflects a polyploid event in m. sativa compared to m. truncatula and a genome duplication event in g. max compared to p. vulgaris. b the percentage of transcripts with each bp go slim annotation, from the total number of sequences with bp go slim annotations, is consistent across all four legumes, suggesting the msgi  <dig>  assembly represents the majority of transcripts in the m. sativa genome



highly expressed and consistently expressed transcripts
using the expression profiles of both b <dig> and f <dig>  we identified the  <dig> most highly expressed transcripts in each subspecies . comparing the top  <dig> expressed transcripts from each subspecies revealed  <dig> transcripts were common to both lists including five that were flower-specific and  <dig> that were nodule-specific. while none of the  <dig> nodule-specific sequences were annotated, additional analyses confirmed that  <dig> of the transcripts contain a conserved cysteine cluster motif common to late nodulin genes and nodule cysteine-rich peptides  <cit> . because these  <dig> nodule-specific transcripts are among the most highly expressed transcripts identified in any of the tissue samples and they are also conserved between the two subspecies, they are excellent candidates for further characterization in nodule formation and the establishment of symbiosis in alfalfa.

transcripts consistently expressed in all tissues may serve ‘housekeeping’ functions. the identification of consistently expressed transcripts is essential for any future qrt-pcr experiment. to aide in identifying potential housekeeping transcripts in msgi  <dig> , sequences with an rpkm > <dig> in all samples were identified and the co-variance  was calculated. this method identified  <dig> transcripts with a co-variance < <dig>  among all tissues analyzed . the transcript with the lowest co-variance  was contig_ <dig> with an average rpkm =  <dig> across all tissues in both m. sativa subspecies; however, this transcript was not homologous to any sequence used in the annotation scheme. contig_ <dig>  which is annotated, has the second most conserved expression pattern, with an average rpkm =  <dig> across all tissues in both subspecies. this transcript is highly homologous to the m. truncatula gene medtr1g <dig> , a member of the ubiquitin superfamily, suggesting a role in protein degradation. additionally, we identified the  <dig> transcripts with the most conserved expression patterns in each subspecies . in m. sativa ssp. sativa the most consistently expressed transcript  is contig_ <dig>  which is highly homologous to medtr2g <dig> , and encodes a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  <dig> subunit. in m. sativa ssp. falcata the most consistently expressed transcript  is contig_ <dig>  which is highly homologous to medtr4g <dig> , and encodes a plac <dig> protein. these transcripts, raw and normalized expression data, may be useful in identifying stably expressed transcripts in tissues of interest for future quantitative real-time pcr experiments to normalize expression across various alfalfa plant tissues, although consistent expression will need to be confirmed empirically.

single nucleotide polymorphism identification
single nucleotide polymorphisms  between msgi  <dig>  and the two m. sativa subspecies were identified from rnaseq read alignments to the msgi  <dig>  assembly . these analyses identified a total of  <dig>  snps in the msgi  <dig>  assembly . these snps were identified in  <dig>  unique msgi  <dig>  sequences . of the  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  are unique to transcripts derived from b <dig> and are distributed among  <dig>  msgi  <dig>  transcripts while  <dig>  are unique to transcripts derived from f <dig> and are distributed among  <dig>  msgi  <dig>  transcripts . of the sequences containing subspecies-specific snps,  <dig>  transcripts in b <dig> and  <dig>  transcripts in f <dig> exhibit tissue-specific expression. in addition to subspecies-specific snps, there were also  <dig>  snps from  <dig>  msgi  <dig>  sequences that were identified in transcripts from both b <dig> and f <dig> . since these snps were found in both subspecies, it means these contigs likely contain sequences from multiple alleles or closely related genes. previous studies also identified high frequencies of snps in alfalfa transcripts from different genotypes, with a high percentage of snps validated to be polymorphic  <cit> . snp densities, among msgi  <dig>  sequences corresponding to m. truncatula genes, were plotted along the m. truncatula chromosomes . largely mirroring the gene density plots, snps are distributed across all chromosomes. overall, there is usually an equal number of snps from both sub-species and snps shared by both sub-species, though there are a few instances where snps from one sub-species dominates. msgi  <dig>  sequences corresponding to these instances are candidates for further study to determine if gene families have been collapsed in the msgi  <dig>  assembly, if there is excessive alternative splicing among these sequences, or if these sequences have diverged between the two sub-species. this publicly available snp data should prove a valuable resource for future marker-assisted selection and genome-wide association studies to identify the genetic underpinnings of complex traits in alfalfa.table  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism statistics

single nucleotide polymorphisms  unique to each m. sativa subspecies and snps identified in both m. sativa subspecies . roughly 60 % of snps unique to one subspecies are only identified in a single tissue. the number of msgi  <dig>  sequences containing snps reveals that each sequence contains multiple snps. details on each snp can be found in additional file 10




web-accessible alfalfa gene index and expression database
we utilized the alfalfa gene index and expression database , available at http://plantgrn.noble.org/aged/ to assess specific biological processes in flowers, stems, leaves, roots, and nodules. this database was built using a similar architecture as the legumeip platform to retrieve and visualize expression patterns using rna-seq data  <cit> . to provide the most functionality for alfalfa researchers, aged allows the user to:  search for differentially expressed sequences between the two subspecies and between tissues within a subspecies;  query for transcripts expressed above a user-provided level for each tissue;  obtain graphical and tabular expression profiles across all tissues for both m. sativa subspecies for transcripts of interest; and  retrieve the annotation for a transcript of interest. additionally, all transcript sequence data are available for download and use including:  the msgi  <dig>  sequences in fasta format;  the expression profiles and annotations of msgi  <dig>  sequences from all libraries ; and  subspecies-specific and subspecies-independent snps. this database is fully expandable and new rna-seq data can be integrated into the database and analysis tools can be updated to provide additional functionality to compare between experiments. this accessibility should facilitate additional mining of the data and a better understanding of biological processes in alfalfa.

differential expression between and within subspecies
the phenotypic differences between m. sativa ssp. sativa  and m. sativa ssp. falcata  suggest fundamental differences in genomic structure, gene content, and/or gene expression between these two subspecies. in total,  <dig>  transcripts  were differentially expressed between m. sativa ssp. sativa and m. sativa ssp. falcata  . in b <dig>   <dig>  transcripts  were identified as differentially expressed between tissues . in f <dig>   <dig>  transcripts  were differential expressed between the sampled tissues .table  <dig> transcripts differentially expressed between m. sativa subspecies

subspecies-specific sequences were also identified; including  <dig>  transcripts uniquely expressed in at least one tissue sample of b <dig> but not detected  in f <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts unique to f <dig> . strikingly, many of the subspecies-specific transcripts identified from each m. sativa genotype had tissue-specific expression. of the  <dig>  b47-specific transcripts,  <dig>   are expressed only in a single tissue while the remaining transcripts are expressed in multiple tissues. similarly,  <dig>   f56-specific transcripts exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns while the remaining transcripts are expressed in multiple tissues. go analyses revealed a statistically significant  over-representation of sequences involved in regulating dna replication and cell growth and division in sequences unique to b <dig>  . conversely, sequences involved in defense responses , phosphatidylinositol signaling , and arabinose metabolism  are significantly  over-represented among sequences unique to f <dig> . many of the go categories over-represented in f56-specific sequences are involved in inositol homeostasis. in plants, increased phosphatidylinositol results in increased starch content and impacts both carbon metabolism and responses to environmental stress  <cit> . transcripts involved in both cell shape and cell plate formation are also over-represented among f56-specific transcripts . hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins and arabinogalactan proteins are involved in cell-to-cell interactions, cell proliferation, cell expansion, and cell wall strengthening. arabinose is an important constituent of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins  <cit> . in arabidopsis, knocking out arabinose biosynthetic genes results in altered cell shape and cell plate formation  <cit> . these subspecies-specific transcripts may represent genes important in conferring the contrasting shoot architectures of m. sativa ssp. sativa and m. sativa ssp. falcata . details of the differentially expressed transcripts can be identified using the aged website available at http://plantgrn.noble.org/aged/.

cold tolerance
medicago sativa ssp. falcata originated in central asia, a much colder region than the near east where medicago sativa ssp. sativa originated  <cit> . these ancient geographic origins have imbued the subspecies with distinct cold tolerance profiles. in general, m. sativa ssp. falcata has greater cold and freezing tolerance than m. sativa ssp sativa. previous studies, performed on leaf and crown tissues  <cit> , have identified a number of candidate genes conferring cold tolerance based on their increased expression profiles in m. sativa ssp. falcata compared to m. truncatula under cold-stress conditions. although the samples in our study were not cold-treated, we identified transcripts in the msgi  <dig>  assembly corresponding to previously identified sequences and examined their expression patterns between b <dig> and f <dig> in the six tissues evaluated in the study. as expected, the majority of the sequences had similar expression patterns in the tissues of both subspecies. however,  <dig> sequences previously identified as cold-induced in m. sativa ssp. falcata were differentially expressed between b <dig> and f <dig> under greenhouse growth conditions. the majority  of these sequences were more highly expressed in multiple tissues of m. sativa ssp. falcata , the more cold-tolerant plant . two of these sequences were not assigned annotations. the  <dig> annotated sequences encode dreb transcription factors , proline dehydrogenases , sucrose synthases , and sequences involved in either gibberellin or glutamate biosynthesis . these sequences may be expressed constitutively higher in m. sativa ssp. falcata compared to m. sativa ssp. sativa, perhaps in anticipation of cold stress. only six of the sequences were expressed higher in b <dig> and all six were differentially expressed between the leaves of the two subspecies. the two annotated sequences both encode sucrose synthase. four additional sucrose synthase transcripts were differentially expressed between the two subspecies, and in all tissues exhibiting differential expression they were more highly expressed in m. sativa ssp. falcata . increased sugar accumulation has been correlated with increased cold tolerance in a number of species . wolkers et al.  <cit>  proposed sugars interact with dehydrin and cold responsive proteins to form stable glasses to prevent desiccation.

floral pigmentation
one of the most notable differences between m. sativa ssp. sativa and m. sativa ssp. falcata is flower color. m. sativa ssp. sativa has violet to lavender-colored flowers while m. sativa ssp. falcata has orange to yellow-colored flowers . alfalfa cultivars with mixtures of m. sativa ssp. sativa and m. sativa ssp. falcata express a range of flower colors including purple, yellow, cream, white and variegated . anthocyanins are the primary pigments contributing to violet and blue flowers while orange and yellow flowers are a result of increased carotenoid synthesis. the biochemical pathways of both anthocyanin and carotenoid biosynthesis are well characterized  but the expression profiles of these sequences in alfalfa have not been previously investigated. using the msgi  <dig>  assembly and rna-seq profiles, we examined the expression patterns of transcripts involved in the biosynthesis of floral pigments in both subspecies. in floral tissues of m. sativa ssp. sativa  the transcript encoding a flavone 3-dioxygenase converting dihydrotricetin to dihydromyricetin  was up-regulated two-fold compared to the floral tissues of f <dig> . dihydromyricetin is a precursor to delphinidin, the anthocyanin responsible for blue/purple coloration. conversely, in f <dig> the transcript for lycopene ε-cyclase, which converts trans-lycopene to δ-carotene and the transcript for ß-cryptoxanthin 3′-hydroxylase, which converts ß-cryptoxanthin to zeaxanthin  were 17- and 6-fold higher relative to b <dig> . the data from this study indicate both anthocyanin and carotenoid pathways are expressed in the floral tissues of both subspecies, suggesting that it is the relative expression of these genes and/or enzyme activities that are responsible for the flower colors exhibited by b <dig> and f <dig>  these results lend genetic support to extend the earlier biochemical work that found evidence for activity of both pathways in yellow and purple flowers of diploid alfalfa  <cit> . that analysis found that yellow flower color in m. sativa ssp. falcata was largely due to carontenoid xanthophyll esters and that the quercetin pigments from the anthocyanin synthesis pathway had minor phenotypic effects. in contrast, purple alfalfa flowers contained a mixture of three anthocyanins  and color variation was due to background effects of the xanthophyll pigments and their interactions with anthoxanthin pigments, rather than differences in the anthocyanin content  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression of transcripts conferring flower color in medicago sativa ssp. sativa  and medicago sativa ssp. falcata . expression patterns comparing b <dig> and f <dig> are presented as heat map blocks. a anthocyanin biosynthesis. early in the pathway, transcripts are up-regulated 2-fold in b <dig> compared to f <dig> . this results in increased delphinidin, the anthocyanin that confers blue coloration to flowers. b carotenoid biosynthesis. transcripts involved in the conversions of trans-lycopene to δ-carotene and β-cryptoxinthin to zeantin, are up regulated 17- and 6-fold, respectively, in f <dig> . the increased carotene synthesis is responsible for the orange and yellow flower color, characteristic of f56



stem and cell wall related sequences
although alfalfa stems contain large amounts of cell-wall carbohydrates , the majority of the cell walls, specifically the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions, are poorly digested by ruminant animals, resulting in inefficient use of the forage  <cit> . lignification of cell walls in post-elongation internodes poses a barrier to cell wall polysaccharide digestion. industrial conversion of stems to ethanol or other fermentation products from cell wall polysaccharides suffers from similar constraints due to lignification. increasing the digestibility of alfalfa cell walls would improve animal performance and utility of alfalfa as a biomass feedstock. however, progress to improve digestibility has been slow due to the lack of information on stem cell wall related genes and their regulation.

b <dig> was selected from germplasm developed for use as a biomass energy feedstock with large, erect non-lodging stems  <cit> . in contrast, f <dig> was selected from germplasm developed for increased forage yield with recumbent stem architectures. based on these phenotypic differences, the expression of genes involved in cellulose and lignin synthesis was expected to differ between the two subspecies. comparing b <dig> and f <dig> identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts in elongating and post-elongation stem internodes, respectively . in elongating internodes  <dig> cellulose synthase transcripts were differentially expressed between the two subspecies, all of which were expressed at a higher level in b <dig>  conversely, a single  cellulose synthase-encoding transcript was differentially expressed in post-elongating internodes and was expressed at a higher level in f <dig> than b <dig> 

using the msgi  <dig>  annotations, we identified  <dig> sequences involved in lignin biosynthesis . of these,  <dig>  were differentially expressed between b <dig> and f <dig> in elongating and/or post-elongating stem internodes. in elongating stem internodes,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in b <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in f <dig>  in post-elongating stem internodes  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in b <dig>  while  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in f <dig>  in elongating internodes, three transcripts encoding ferrulate-5-hydroxylase  have greater expression in f <dig> while two have greater expression in b <dig>  in post-elongating stems three f5h transcripts are expressed at higher levels in b <dig> while only a single f5h encoding transcript is expressed higher in f <dig>  f5h is involved in syringyl lignin biosynthesis. in arabidopsis, f5h over-expression results in increased stem lignin  <cit> . two transcripts encoding caffeic acid o-methyltransferase , which acts downstream of f5h in the lignin biosynthesis pathway, were differentially expressed between b <dig> and f <dig>  both were expressed at higher levels in elongating and post-elongating stem internodes of b <dig>  in alfalfa, down-regulating comt results in decreased lignin content  <cit> . further dissection of gene expression differences leading to differences in alfalfa stem cell wall composition will likely require isolation of specific tissue types as demonstrated by zhao et al.  <cit> .

using the msgi  <dig>  annotation,  <dig> nac transcription factors  were identified in the transcriptome assembly. the majority  were expressed in elongating and/or post-elongating stem internodes, suggesting they are important in alfalfa stem development. four nac tfs were uniquely expressed in elongating and post-elongating stem internodes . all four had higher expression in the post-elongating internodes of both subspecies, although the change in expression was not statistically significant in any comparisons. genomic studies in arabidopsis and poplar have identified nac domain tfs that regulate the formation of xylem and secondary cell wall formation  <cit> . in this study, five nac tfs were differentially expressed between b <dig> and f <dig> elongating internodes, three up-regulated in f <dig> and two up-regulated in b <dig>  two of the nacs differentially expressed between b <dig> and f <dig>  may play important roles in secondary cell wall development. contig_ <dig>  which is expressed eight times higher in f <dig> than b <dig>  is homologous to the a. thaliana gene at4g <dig> . snd <dig> is an indirect target of snd <dig>  a master regulator of xylem fiber secondary cell wall formation  <cit> . in arabidopisis, snd <dig> repression results in decreased cell wall sugars  while snd <dig> over-expression results in a xylem fiber-specific increase in the secondary cell wall thickness accompanied by an increase in the mannose and rhamnose content of stems  <cit> . additionally, contig_ <dig>  which was expressed three times higher in f <dig> than b <dig>  is homologous to the arabidopsis gene at5g <dig>  vni <dig>  in arabidopsis, vni <dig> loss of function results in an increased expression of genes involved in xylem vessel formation  <cit> . interestingly, the arabidopsis homologs of the two nac tfs up-regulated in b <dig>  are involved in defense responses  <cit> , but have not been shown to play a role in secondary cell wall development.

we used a single linkage clustering analysis  to determine if any gene families in m. sativa underwent a familial expansion relative to m. truncatula, as has been documented in soybean  <cit> , and whether any of these were involved in cell wall synthesis. using this approach, we identified a total of  <dig> gene families that have undergone a statistically significant  expansion  in m. sativa relative to m. truncatula . three gene families identified in this analysis are directly involved in secondary cell wall synthesis. in arabidopsis, cyt <dig> mutants are deficient in mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase and exhibit a 5-fold decrease in cellulose content  <cit> . analysis of cyt <dig> mutant cell walls found decreased mannose and fucose  levels, but increased rhamnose and xylose  compared to wild type  <cit> . single linkage cluster analyses identified three cyt <dig> genes  in m. truncatula and  <dig> cyt <dig> homologs in msgi  <dig> . examining the expression patterns in b <dig> revealed that members of this family were expressed higher in elongating stem internodes while in f <dig> members were more highly expressed in post-elongating stem internodes. the β-d-xylosidase family  exhibits similar expression patterns . xylan is the major component of hemicelluloses, the main constituent of plant cell walls. β-d-xylosidase is a key enzyme for xylan degradation  <cit> . in arabidopsis, xyl <dig> knockout plants show increased susceptibility to hydrolysis by cellulases, suggesting that xyl <dig> is important in cell wall structure  <cit> . finally, the wat <dig> gene family  exhibited a fourfold expansion in m. sativa . wat <dig> acts upstream of snd <dig> and nst <dig> to regulate secondary wall formation in xylem fibers  <cit> . in arabidopsis, knockout mutants exhibit no secondary cell wall development in xylem fibers, are shorter, bushier and have twice as many stems and stems are weaker  <cit> . wat <dig> expression is highly up-regulated in both elongating and post-elongating stem internodes of both b <dig> and f <dig>  the familial expansion of these genes in m. sativa subspecies, coupled with their increased expression in both elongating and post-elongating internodes, make these sequences excellent candidates for future experiments investigating alfalfa cell wall development.

legumes have a unique ability to establish and sustain symbiotic relationships with rhizobia to form n <dig> fixing nodules. this symbiotic relationship requires signaling between the plant and bacteria for nodule development and nodule maintenance. many of the genes involved in nodulation have been identified in m. truncatula . using blastn , we identified homologs of the nodulation genes in the msgi  <dig>  assembly . as expected, expression was usually highest in nodules and associated roots. in m. truncatula, a strikingly large number  of nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides  with a conserved pattern of cysteine residues have been identified  <cit> , some of which have a demonstrated role in nodule development  <cit> . ncrs have not been previously investigated in alfalfa. using all six reading frame translations of the msgi  <dig>  assembly, we identified  <dig>  nodule-specific sequences with a nodule-specific ncr motif . this is almost exactly four times the number identified in m. truncatula, further confirming that this gene family did not undergo a familial gene expansion, which may indicate highly conserved function within the ncr family. the  <dig>  nodule-specific ncr sequences are roughly 22 % of the nodule-specific sequences identified in both m. sativa subspecies. interestingly,  <dig> nodule-specific sequences containing ncr motifs were expressed in b <dig> but were not expressed in f <dig> while another  <dig> sequences exhibited the opposite expression pattern. of these  <dig> sequences,  <dig> encoded a signal peptide  <cit> , a hallmark of ncr sequences . the remaining  <dig> sequences are most probably ncr sequences, but are not full-length sequences likely due to the rna extraction processes. these  <dig> ncrs may be sub-species-specific or may reflect different ncrs expressed at various stages of nodule development.

of all the tissue-specific sequences  almost 40 % were nodule-specific  . not surprisingly, sequences with annotations involving transport and nitrogen homeostasis, the major function of nodules, are significantly  over-represented among nodule-specific sequences . the high number of transcripts involved in transport, including amino acid transporters, peptide transporters, iron and sulfur transporters, transmembrane transporters, sugar transporters, and nitrate transporters, reflect the importance of photosynthates imported to the nodule and nitrogenous compounds exported from the nodule to the roots for use throughout the plant. additionally,  <dig> transcription factors from  <dig> different families  exhibit nodule-specific expression in both b <dig> and f <dig>  nodule-specific expression of transcription factors highlights the changes in gene expression required to accommodate nodulation and symbiosis.table  <dig> transcript expression profiles in medicago sativa ssp. sativa  and m. sativa ssp. falcata

es elongating stem internodes, pes post-elongation stem internodes



among the  <dig>  sequences that exhibit nodule specific expression in both subspecies, sequences involved in cyanoalanine metabolism were significantly  overrepresented in nodules. cyanoalanine nitrilase  is important in cyanide detoxification, converting cyanoalanine into aspartic acid  <cit> . similarly, cyanoalanine hydratase , a nit <dig> homolog, hydrolyzes cyanoalanine into asparagine and aspartic acid  <cit> . in neurospora crassa, nit <dig> regulates the expression of nitrate assimilatory structural genes  <cit> . cyanide is produced as a by-product of ethylene biosynthesis, which is regulated by the availability of nitrate in the soil. increased ethylene inhibits nodule and lateral root formation. it is possible that enzymes involved in cyanide catabolism serve as an alternative asparagine synthesis pathway, induced as the plant shifts from n <dig> fixation to utilizing nitrate available in surrounding soils. asparagine is produced from aspartic acid, the primary assimilation product of symbiotic nitrogen fixation  <cit>  and has recently been implicated in the n-feedback regulation of n fixation in m. truncatula  <cit> . finally, sequences encoding glutamine synthase , one of the main enzymes for assimilating symbiotically fixed nitrogen  <cit> , are over-represented among nodule-specific transcripts compared to the rest of the msgi  <dig>  assembly.

although many sequence families are over-represented in nodule-specific transcripts, there are also many sequences that were not assigned an annotation by any method. however, the conservation of tissue-specific expression between two subspecies is indicative of conserved function. these nodule-specific sequences are excellent candidates for future work exploring nitrogen fixation in m. sativa.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented in this study have been assembled into an online resource for analyses of gene expression in m. sativa for six distinct tissue types derived from two biologically distinct subspecies . this publicly available resource, aged , is a valuable tool for alfalfa and legume researchers investigating various biological processes. to illustrate the utility of this resource, we used the data to explore the differences between the two m. sativa subspecies in their expression of sequences involved in cold tolerance, anthocyanin and carotenoid biosynthesis as it relates to flower color, identified sequences involved in shoot architecture, and present nodule-specific sequences which may play important roles in nitrogen fixation.
