BACKGROUND
in any structure determination process of a biological macromolecule the general goal is to obtain from the available data a structure as accurate as possible. for all high throughput procedures as used in structural genomics projects the structure determination process has to be as fast as possible, demanding that only a minimal set of experimental data is recorded. one way to speed up the nmr structure determination process is to reduce the required number of experimental restraints and/or to use only restraints that are relatively easy to obtain e.g. backbone dihedral angles, chemical shifts, residual dipolar couplings, hydrogen bonds, or hn-hn noes. when the amount of available experimental data is limited, the use of additional information such as structural data from homologous proteins is advisable. most fast methods previously described in the literature are mainly aimed at determining the global fold of a protein  <cit> . another set of methods directly uses information from different sources, namely nmr and x-ray, for joint structure refinement to obtain refined structures. it is common to these approaches that discrepancies between nmr and x-ray data are manually corrected, for example by removing violated noes, reassigning noes or hydrogen-bonds, and taking spin-diffusion effects on nmr restraints into account  <cit> .

from the conceptual point of view in any structural prediction or calculation from a set of mixed data one has to decide beforehand what kind of structure is the target of the procedure since there is nothing like "the structure". this question is inherently answered in purely experimental structure determination since solution nmr spectroscopy determines the structure in solution and a crystal structure in the crystal. more importantly, the selected experimental conditions such as the buffer and the absence or presence of ligands select the target structural set.

here, we present a novel general and fully automated approach called isic  for the combination of structural information from different sources. it allows the predefinition and selection of the target structural set and properly treats discrepancies inherent in the input structural data, thereby ensuring that the additional input data are properly biased toward the target structural set. using the combined information, high resolution structures are calculated and results are automatically verified on experimental data. one possible application of the isic algorithm for rapid structure determination would include the use experimental solution nmr data that is relatively easy to obtain, such as backbone dihedral angles, chemical shifts, residual dipolar couplings, hydrogen bonds, or hn-hn noes that alone allow the calculation of a low to medium resolution nmr structure, supplemented with for example data from homology modeling or from a homologous x-ray structure.

in this paper, isic was tested for three applications that may occur in "real life". firstly, the refinement of a solution structure of a protein with an x-ray structure of the same protein determined under slightly different conditions , secondly the refinement of a structure calculated from a limited set of nmr data with an x-ray structure of the same protein also determined under slightly different conditions and last, the refinement of a known nmr structure with a known x-ray structure of the same protein that is largely different . for the first case we selected the ras-binding domain of byr <dig>  from schizosaccharomyces pombe  for which both a solution structure of the free protein  <cit>  and a crystal structure of byr2-rbd in complex with ras  <cit>  are available. both structures are of medium quality of about  <dig> Å resolution  or equivalent resolution  making it an ideal target for structure refinement. in addition, it is expected that the two structures are not identical since complex formation with ras leads to small but significant conformational changes in the structure of byr <dig>  the aim of the second test was to refine a structure that was obtained using only readily available nmr data. for this case the ras-binding domain of ralgds  from human was used. the solution structure  has been published previously  <cit> . for the current tests the low resolution structure of a shorter construct  was obtained by using only relatively easily available nmr data such as h-bonds, dihedral angles, and back-bone noes. in addition a medium quality  x-ray structure of ralgds in complex with ras is available  <cit> . similar to the first test case small but significant conformational changes between ralgds in its free solution form and its crystal form in complex with ras are expected. as a third example we used the nmr  <cit>   and the crystal structure  <cit>   of the immunoglobulin binding domain of protein g from streptococcus, species lancefield group g. in this case large global structural differences were observed since in solution dimerization introduced by core mutations induces a domain swapping of a β-pleated sheet.

theoretical considerations
general considerations
in the improvement of structures by including information from other sources two main cases have to be distinguished: in the first case the additional information is describing the same set of structures . here the proper weighting of the additional information is the main point when the "true" structure should be optimally approximated. in the second case the additional information is taken from structures that are supposed to be similar but are different nevertheless . here an additional difficulty arises since one has to estimate how well the additional structure will apply to the structure in question since otherwise not a properly biased solution will be obtained. the problem can be formulated as the aim to obtain the most probable structure or the most probable set of structures s <dig> with a conditional probability p higher than a threshold value pt. the combination of information from n different sources ii is a problem often encountered in structural biology. when s <dig> is a set of purely nmr derived protein structures, a would be the general knowledge about the system that is the physical model including the covalent structure and the interaction potentials as they enter a typical molecular dynamics calculation. the nmr derived information i <dig> is usually expressed as a set of experimental restraints r <dig> = {r <dig> ...., r1m} containing m restraints that essentially reduce the accessible conformational space of the probable solutions. the experimental restraints are rather inhomogeneous since they include information such as distance restraints from noesy spectra, dihedral angle information from j-couplings or chemical shifts, as well as intra molecular orientational restraints from residual dipolar couplings.

an elegant semi quantitative way to find the most probable structures si is the simulated annealing protocol  <cit> , where the information a is an intrinsic part of the molecular dynamics routines used.

in case two the situation becomes much more complex since structural information that corresponds not exactly to the conditions used in the actual experiment is added from other sources. when this information is expressed again in the form of sets of restraints ri, structures s0p  have to be found with high probabilities p. when a restrained simulated annealing approach is used, the physical model is again an implicit feature, that is p can be replaced by p. with the exception of the restraint set r <dig> corresponding to the leading set of structures s <dig>  the primary restraints ri*  that are derived from the other sources in general do not directly apply to the conditions of the leading set of structures. this can for example occur due to different experimental conditions. as a consequence, new restraints ri have to be calculated, which directly apply to the true set of structures s <dig>  this means that for r <dig> one can define r <dig> = r1*, but for the other restraint sets ri* we have to determine to which amount their individual restraints apply to the true structures s <dig>  as explained below.

p = p     

in general, the complete description of the sets of restraints ri has to be given as a multidimensional probability distribution p. the different sets of restraints and the restraints themselves are coupled since they are derived from related structures and coupled by the physical model. the probability p and thus the probability distribution p of a set of restraints ri in the leading structures can be calculated from the known ri* by

p = pp     

equation  <dig> shows that ri depends again on a multidimensional probability distribution and a simplification of the problem is mandatory.

in the standard simulated annealing approach the individual restraints rik are assumed primarily as independent, their coupling is performed indirectly by the algorithm itself, which selects consistent solutions. as long as the same restraints rik are considered  one can calculate the probability that a newly created restraint r0k that corresponds to the "true" solution structures s <dig> has a given value in the set s <dig>  the restraints r0k are used later on for calculating the set of true solution structures s <dig> 

p = pp     

the indices i and k specify the data set used and the specific restraint, respectively. here, it is assumed that in first order the individual restraints r0k and r0l are independent for k≠l. for the calculation of p it would be useful to have information about the same restraints in the structures derived from the different data sets. below it will be shown how a reasonable estimate can be obtained by using a md-sampling procedure.

equation  <dig> can be used in two different ways: when a good estimate of the conditional probability is known it can be directly applied. if this is not the case, one can test the hypothesis that p is close to  <dig> for a data set i. since we assume that the experimental data  <dig> represents the "true" ensemble, one can test if a restraint rik is part of the same ensemble as r1k and simply discard all restraints rik in the calculation that do not fulfill the condition. p in eq.  <dig> describes the probability that a substitute restraint rik* has a given value in the set of structures si and clearly this probability depends on factors such as the corresponding second moments σ of the restraints in the set of structures si.

main features of the algorithm
the general features of the isic algorithm based on the above considerations are described in figure  <dig> for the important application that a nmr solution structure is improved by an x-ray-structure. in isic the structural information from a set of different sources i consisting of members si  is used to improve the structures of the set s <dig>  for instance, nmr structures in s <dig> are refined by an appropriate x-ray structure s <dig>  in this approach the different structural sources si are usually not identical, as is evident in the case of solution and crystal structures, but they may differ also in other aspects such as in amino acid sequence or absence or presence of interacting molecules.

one important concept is that the available structural information from different sources is first converted into a dense network of derived substitute restraints rik* that can directly be compared . they are calculated from a structural bundle and are coded as main chain and side chain dihedral angle restraints, as well as distance restraints between selected sets of atoms. the expectation values and standard deviations s of the sample are directly calculated from the given structural bundle by the permol-algorithm  <cit> . in case the leading structural set s <dig> consists of a set of nmr structures, such a bundle is already available. when no structural bundle is available, it first has to be created in a well-defined manner . the restraints r1k* = r1k  are then combined with the sets of restraints rik*  to obtain a final set of restraints r0k  and a new bundle of structures s <dig> is calculated. the quality of the new structural bundle can be validated against the original experimental data, a step which increases the confidence in the result and can be used to assess the improvement of the structures but is not required by the algorithm.

structure improvement of the ras-binding domain of byr2
as a first example, the auremol-isic algorithm was tested on the structure improvement of the ras-binding domain of byr <dig> for which both a set of  <dig> solution nmr structures  <cit>  and a single x-ray structure of byr <dig> in complex with ras  <cit>  are available. the x-ray structure was used as source structure to improve the nmr structure s <dig> 

as described above and using the parameters given in table  <dig>  distance and dihedral angle restraints were created that represent the x-ray data. in total  <dig> distance restraints and  <dig> dihedral angle restraints were obtained, defining the restraint set r2x*. please note that for residues  <dig> –  <dig> no restraints were obtained since these residues were invisible in the original x-ray structure. employing these restraints and dyana v. <dig>   <dig> structures were calculated. the  <dig> best in terms of dyana target function were selected to define the set of structures s2x that represents the x-ray data. for this purpose a standard dyana simulated annealing protocol was used, which includes  <dig> tad  steps. one fifth of these are performed at an initial high temperature, followed by slow cooling during the rest of the schedule. figures 2b and 2c show a comparison between the original x-ray structure and the corresponding set of structures s2x, respectively. as described above from the set s2x the set of restraints r2* was generated. it consisted of  <dig> distance restraints,  <dig> dihedral angle restraints and  <dig> hydrogen bond restraints. the corresponding parameters used for restraint generation are given in table  <dig>  the set of  <dig> submitted solution nmr structures defines the set of structures s <dig> , from which  <dig> distance restraints,  <dig> dihedral angle restraints, and  <dig> hydrogen bond restraints were generated that define the leading restraint set r <dig> = r1*. please note that  <dig> is the sum of all hydrogen bond restraints identified in the individual structures of the selected bundle. the corresponding parameters are given in table  <dig>  no separate structures were calculated using the restraint set r <dig> alone. in the next step the restraints from sets r1* and r2* were combined as described in the materials and methods section using the parameters given in table  <dig>  in the case of mismatching restraints only the restraint corresponding to the nmr structure was further used. after the restraint combination  <dig> distance restraints,  <dig> dihedral angle restraints and  <dig> hydrogen bond restraints were obtained, defining the restraint set r <dig>  using the set r <dig>  <dig> structures were calculated with dyana and the ten best in terms of the dyana target function were selected for further analysis, defining the set s <dig> . the structures were refined in explicit solvent   <cit> . as result a set  of  <dig> structures of byr2-rbd  was obtained.

all secondary structure elements are well defined in these structures. especially the c-terminal α-helix that was poorly characterized in the original nmr structures is now very well defined. in addition, the quality of the resulting structures was compared to the original nmr and x-ray structures  employing rmsd calculations, ramachandran plots, and nmr r-factor calculations. the results clearly show that the refined structures show improved values for all categories. the rmsd values of the newly calculated structures are drastically reduced compared to the original nmr structures, with values of  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm for the backbone n atoms, respectively. the percentage of residues in the most favored and allowed regions of the ramachandran plot increased for the refined structures compared to both sets of input structures . since the goal was to obtain refined solution structures, the resulting structures have been analyzed, whether they really explain the experimental data better than the original structures. a suitable check for this purpose is the calculation of nmr r-factors  <cit>  that directly compare an experimental nmr noesy spectrum with the corresponding spectrum back-calculated from a single or a set of test structures. for the calculations shown in table  <dig> we used the structurally most discriminating r-factor r <dig> as described by us previously  <cit> . the r-factors show also a significant improvement for the refined structures indicating that we were really able to obtain refined solution structures by the use of external data.

structure improvement of the ras-binding domain of ralgds-rbd
as a second test case the ras-binding domain of ralgds was chosen using a set of low resolution solution nmr structures as input together with a single x-ray structure of ralgds in complex with ras  <cit> . as in the first test case the x-ray structure was used to improve the nmr structure.

low resolution nmr structures for ralgds-rbd  were newly calculated using easily available nmr data such as  <dig> h-bonds,  <dig> Φ and Ψ dihedral angles, and  <dig> backbone noes involving hn and hα atoms. employing these restraints and dyana v. <dig>   <dig> structures were calculated as described above of which the  <dig> best in terms of dyana target function were selected to define the set of nmr input structures s <dig> . as described above and using the parameters given in table  <dig>  distance and dihedral angle restraints were created that represent the x-ray data. in total  <dig> distance restraints and  <dig> dihedral angle restraints were obtained, defining the restraint set r2x*. please note that for residues  <dig>   <dig> –  <dig>   <dig> –  <dig>  and  <dig> no restraints were obtained since these residues were invisible in the original x-ray structure. employing these restraints and dyana  <dig> ,  <dig> structures were calculated, of which the  <dig> best in terms of dyana target function were selected to define the set of structures s2x that represents the x-ray data. the original input x-ray structure of ralgds obtained in complex with ras is shown in figure 3b. as described above from the set s2x the set of restraints r2* was generated consisting of  <dig> distance restraints,  <dig> dihedral angle restraints and  <dig> hydrogen bond restraints. the corresponding parameters used for restraint generation are given in table  <dig>  the set of  <dig> low resolution nmr structures defines the set of structures s <dig> , from which  <dig> distance restraints,  <dig> dihedral angle restraints, and  <dig> hydrogenbond restraints were generated that define the leading restraint set r <dig> = r1*. the corresponding parameters are given in table  <dig>  in the next step the restraints from sets r1* and r2* were combined as described in the materials and methods section using the parameters given in table  <dig>  in the case of mismatching restraints only the restraint corresponding to the nmr structure was further used. after restraint combination we obtained  <dig> distance restraints,  <dig> dihedral angle restraints and  <dig> hydrogen bond restraints, defining the restraint set r <dig>  using the set r <dig>  <dig> structures were calculated with dyana and the ten best in terms of the dyana target function were selected for further analysis, defining the set s <dig> . all secondary structure elements are well defined in these structures. especially the locations of the two α-helices that were poorly defined in the input nmr structures are now substantially better defined. in addition, the quality of the resulting structures was compared to the original nmr structure  employing rmsd calculations, ramachandran plots, and nmr r-factor calculations. the rmsd values of the newly calculated structures are drastically reduced compared to the input nmr structures with values of  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm for the rmsd values to the mean structure of the backbone n atoms, respectively. the corresponding average pair wise rmsd values for the backbone atoms show a similar trend with values of  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm, respectively . this clearly shows the influence of the increased number of well defined restraints on the refined structures. the average pair wise rmsd difference between the low resolution nmr input structures and the refined structures amounts to  <dig>  nm indicating on the one hand the influence of the second source  on the refinement and on the other hand that the refined structures are within the conformational space occupied by the low resolution nmr input structures. the percentage of residues in the most favored regions of the ramachandran plot did not change for the refined structures compared to the low resolution input nmr structures . the calculation of nmr r-factors was performed as described for byr2-rbd. the r-factors show also a significant improvement for the refined structures indicating that we were able to obtain refined solution structures by the use of external data.

structure improvement of the b <dig> immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein g
the highest risk in using data from other sources to improve a target structure is a possible bias towards the added structure. in the worst case instead of a refined target structure the structure from the additional source is essentially reproduced. to investigate a possible bias introduced by an additional source on the isic algorithm two structures were selected, which clearly show different structural details. the solution structure of the b <dig> immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein g  <cit>  differs clearly from the x-ray structure  <cit> . the nmr structure was obtained from a dimeric form of the protein, where  <dig> core mutations lead to dimerization of the protein and a domain swapping of a β-pleated sheet. figure 4a shows one half of the dimeric nmr structure compared the monomeric x-ray structure of the b <dig> domain . as it can clearly be seen the orientation of the last two β-strands is considerably different between the  <dig> structures. a simple averaging process between these two sets of structures leads to substantially incorrect structures and not to any improvements . however, applying the isic algorithm however takes these structural differences automatically into account. we used the isic algorithm as described above by using the same parameters as described for byr2-rbd and details of the calculations are given in the caption of figure  <dig>  in the first step a bundle of structures representing the x-ray information  was generated. from this set and the nmr structures restraints were generated and combined with isic and new improved structures were calculated . as can be seen from figure 4d the resulting structures look very similar to the original nmr structure but the rmsd-values and the ramachandran quality have slightly improved . note that the original nmr structures were in this example already very well defined. we did also the inverse experiment, using the nmr-structure to improve the x-ray structure and obtained again an unbiased structure with all characteristics of the original structure .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
any determination of solution structures from experimental data is not  the direct calculation of the only existing solution but the search for a set of structures consistent with the experimental data and additional knowledge of the system . the use of substitute restraints as introduced here with a simulated annealing protocol for restrained molecular dynamics is an efficient method to combine strongly coupled knowledge from different sources. a proper bias toward the selected target set of structures can be achieved by bayesian reasoning, thus using the additional information only to increase the probability to find the "true" ground state set of structures corresponding to the experimental conditions selected. the combination with validation tools such as the calculation of nmr r-factors strengthens the impact of the method considerably since the improvement of the structures can be assessed quantitatively. this is clearly visible for the example of byr2-rbd where our improved structures also better explain the experimental data. even the choice of largely inappropriate additional knowledge does not lead to distortion of the original structure as shown for the immunoglobulin binding domain.

in the present paper the automated isic algorithm was used to improve a solution structure by related x-ray data. the qualities of both the originally submitted byr <dig> nmr structures as well as the corresponding x-ray structure were both limited; therefore, giving an excellent example for testing the isic algorithm. the same is true for the ralgds-rbd test case where both the set of low resolution nmr structures of ralgds that were calculated only from easily available experimental data and the corresponding x-ray data are of medium quality. especially this last test case is a good example how the inclusion of additional data can speed up the nmr structure determination process for example in structural genomics efforts. however, isic can also be used for other applications such as the improvement of a nmr structure of a given protein by nmr structures of homologues proteins or pure homology models. the same would be true for the improvement of x-ray structures by nmr-data when some parts of the electron density map are ill-defined.

here, the x-ray r-factor would provide the validation tool. a similar application that one may encounter more often in the future is the calculation of nmr-structures of very large proteins using only a limited set of experimental data. one can think about other scenarios for the application of isic. when no x-ray structure of the protein is available homology models from related proteins may be used.
