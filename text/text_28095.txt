BACKGROUND
transcriptomics technologies have successfully been used for biomarker discovery and the study of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms  <cit> . recently, advances in sequencing technology have allowed for direct identification of transcript specific sequences  that are digitally counted, and the analysis of differences in gene expression with unprecedented accuracy  <cit> . one specific application of next generation gene expression analysis is deepsage, a tag sequencing method on the illumina high-throughput sequencing platform that is analogous to longsage  <cit> . such sequencing-based technologies offer distinct advantages over expression micro-arrays, such as a higher dynamic range, the increased power for detection of low abundance transcripts, and the detection of novel transcripts and transcript variants  <cit> . furthermore, next generation sequencing technologies show less variation between different study sites than microarray technology and are not content-limited  <cit> .

transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood is of great interest for clinical research; where significant differences between samples obtained in a minimally invasive and cost-effective manner can be translated into gene signatures of disease stage, drug response and toxicity  <cit> . blood comes into contact with almost every tissue and organ of the human body and due to its cellular composition it can reflect both physiological and pathogenic stimuli. gene expression differences in peripheral whole blood have been used to determine signatures related to acute myeloid leukaemia  <cit> , but also in neuropsychiatric disorders and huntington's disease where significant correlation was found between blood and brain gene expression  <cit> . furthermore disease signatures can be robust across tissues and experiments and in a large meta-analysis study performed by dudley and colleagues, it was demonstrated that gene expression profiles in various tissues from the same disease were more similar than gene expression profiles from identical tissues from different diseases  <cit> . furthermore, 80% of genes expressed in peripheral blood cells are shared with other important tissues  <cit> . these results suggest that transcriptome analysis of the blood is often informative even when the originating pathology stems from a different tissue.

blood is composed of three main cell types. the main component is red blood cells , including the progenitor erythrocytes called reticulocytes, followed by platelets  and white blood cells . while white blood cells make up the minority, they are the most informative and in the past, many studies have been performed on the isolated white blood cell fraction. however, white blood cell isolation kits can induce a technical bias that can confound the original expression profile of the samples and delayed sample processing can affect gene expression profiles  <cit> . this means that white blood cell separation protocols require quick and accurate processing, which can be difficult in a clinical setting. the expression profile of a sample is better preserved by a whole blood collection method, like the pax gene blood rna system  <cit> . another advantage of this system is that samples can be frozen for up to  <dig> years without affecting the expression profile  <cit> . however, cell sorting and counting is not possible because blood cells are lysed directly after collection. therefore, abundant transcripts in abundant cell types may conceal the more interesting less abundant transcripts from less abundant cell types. particularly, the presence of globin transcripts originating from reticulocytes in whole blood samples may limit the sensitivity of gene expression profiling experiments  <cit> , since globin transcripts can constitute up to 70% of the total whole blood mrna population  <cit> . while in microarray experiments the presence of globin transcripts may reduce the amount of fluorescent label available for other transcripts but otherwise just results in a saturated spot on the microarray, the high abundance of globin transcripts is more of a concern in sequencing-based expression profiling studies. since measuring absolute abundance, globin transcripts will be sequenced over and over again, while limiting the coverage of other transcripts.

to deal with the abundance of globin transcripts in whole blood mrna, several globin reduction protocols have been successfully used in gene expression studies  <cit> . the removal of alpha and beta globin mrna can be achieved by selective hybridization of biotinylated globin sequence specific oligos with the globin transcripts and depleting them from the total mrna population through magnetic beads  <cit> . another approach developed by affymetrix and preanalytix utilizes 3' specific pnas to inhibit reverse transcription during cdna synthesis. alternatively, a high abundance transcript depletion protocol adopts the properties of the kamtchaka crab duplex specific nuclease to selectively reduce the most abundant rna transcripts  <cit> .

our aim in the present study is to investigate the effect of globin transcript reduction on the specificity and sensitivity of digital gene expression profiling .

RESULTS
globin transcripts can successfully be reduced in whole blood samples
to investigate whether the rna quality was affected by globin reduction, the rna integrity number  value was determined for each sample  with a rin value of  <dig> representing the highest rna quality. on average, the rin value was slightly lower in the globin-reduced samples compared to the non-reduced samples indicating a minor reduction in rna quality. additionally, we measured rna concentrations before and after globin reduction and observed an rna yield loss of 5-9%. general sequencing and alignment statistics are given in table  <dig>  to verify if globin reduction was successful, the percentage of globin transcripts was determined in the reduced and non-reduced samples. the most abundant transcripts in the non-reduced samples corresponded to globin alpha <dig> , globin beta  and globin alpha <dig>  . the percentage of globin transcripts constituted on average 60%  of total reported alignments and for the reduced samples this dropped to  <dig> % -  <dig> % , demonstrating the efficiency of the globin reduction protocol. the two transcripts that were most abundant after the globin transcripts, lysozyme  and ribosomal protein  transcripts were detected at higher levels in the globin-reduced samples. in order to validate the next generation sequencing results we performed qpcr for hba and hbb for  <dig> non reduced and reduced samples and the results confirmed the next generation sequencing results .

to examine the reproducibility of globin reduction we performed a logarithmic transformation on the count data from the  <dig> globin reduced samples and calculated the correlation. correlation values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , showing good reproducibility after globin reduction .

differential gene expression differences between globin reduced and non-reduced samples
to investigate if more genes could be identified after globin reduction we used the edger bioconductor statistical r package to examine differential gene expression between the  <dig> globin reduced and  <dig> non-reduced samples. we identified  <dig>  uniquely expressed genes in the  <dig> samples and  <dig>  out of these  <dig>  genes were detected at significantly higher levels  in the globin reduced samples . there were  <dig> genes detected at significantly lower levels in the globin reduced samples. the transcripts that were the most significantly decreased  were the pseudogene cxorf <dig> and the  <dig> globin transcripts globin delta , hemoglobin beta , hemoglobin alpha  <dig>  hemoglobin alpha  <dig>  . furthermore,  <dig> other non-globin transcripts were significantly reduced by the globin reduction procedure .

the  <dig> most abundant globin transcripts are in the top five of differentially down-regulated transcripts .

to examine why  <dig> non-globin transcripts were reduced by the globin reduction procedure, we examined possible non-target specific hybridization of the globin oligos. using the sequences of the ten biotinylated oligonucleotides from the globin reduction kit we performed a blastn search against the human mrna reference genome but only the  <dig> globin transcripts that were found to be most significantly decreased in our globin-reduced samples showed significant hits in blastn. moreover, oligonucleotide sequences were analyzed with rnahybrid, an online tool for determining the minimum free hybridization energy between a long and a short rna  <cit>  but no conclusive evidence was found for non-specific hybridization between oligonucleotides from the globin reduction kit and the  <dig> non-globin transcripts that were reduced in our globin-reduced samples. finally we wanted to investigate if any of the  <dig> transcripts could have been co-captured with the globin transcripts. hence we investigated whether there was sequence homology between the  <dig> top reduced transcripts and the globin transcripts but there was no indication of co-capturing based on sequence homology. furthermore, more than half the transcripts reported as non-specifically detected at lower levels were derived from pseudogenes or expressed at very low levels.

transcripts detected in globin-reduced samples only
from the total number of  <dig>  transcripts discovered in our sage experiments,  <dig>  were expressed above the threshold of at least  <dig> tags in  <dig> out of the  <dig> samples in both the globin reduced and non-reduced group. we identified  <dig>  transcripts in the globin-reduced samples that were not expressed above the threshold in the non-reduced samples and  <dig> transcripts in the non-globin reduced samples that could not be detected in the globin-reduced samples . additionally,  <dig>  transcripts were detected in globin-reduced samples only but did not reach the threshold . increasing the threshold tag number resulted in a higher number of genes detected by the globin reduced samples while the number of genes only detected in non-reduced samples remained approximately the same. furthermore increasing the threshold resulted in less genes identified by both groups.

functional enrichment and gene biotype analysis
for the  <dig>  transcripts identified in the globin reduced samples only, we performed gene ontology  term enrichment analysis using the online david bioinformatics resources  <dig>   <cit>  . the go terms that were most significantly enriched were "metal and ion binding" and "dna binding", the latter including genes encoding for proteins with roles in transcription and regulation of transcription. we also performed the same enrichment analysis for the  <dig>  transcripts that did not reach the more stringent threshold. this group of genes also showed significant enrichment for metal and ion binding proteins. additionally, we observed enrichment in transcripts coding for cell surface receptors signal transduction proteins, g-protein coupled receptors and proteins involved in neurological processes. since these transcripts are present in low copy numbers in our samples, these transcripts would benefit from globin reduction and even greater depth of sequencing.

there are around  <dig>  protein-coding genes that together comprise only 2% of the human genome  <cit> . however, a large fraction of transcripts map outside known protein coding genes  <cit>  and it is becoming clear that non-protein-coding rnas play critical roles as transcriptional, post-transcriptional and chromatin-modifying regulators  <cit> . as such, we were interested in characterizing the gene biotype of the  <dig>  transcripts identified in our gene expression analysis . we analyzed the transcripts according to the groups defined in figure  <dig>  the majority of transcripts from all three groups were protein coding transcripts. however, there were subtle differences in the identified transcripts. the  <dig> transcripts that were uniquely identified in the globin-reduced samples contained slightly elevated numbers of pseudogenes, processed transcripts and large intergenic non-coding rnas . the  <dig> transcripts whose tag numbers were too low to be consistently ascribed to either of the experimental groups contained relatively more pseudogenes.

sequencing depth vs. globin reduction - genes discovered
the previous results showed that by reducing the number of globin transcripts before sequencing, the number of different transcripts that can be identified increases. next, we investigated how much additional sequencing is required to achieve this effect of globin reduction just by sequencing non-globin reduced samples at a greater depth. for this purpose we compared results from non-globin reduced rna samples that were sequenced at high and low sequencing depth. at two times higher sequencing depth, the reported alignments as well as the number of identified transcripts for each of the samples increased to the level of the globin reduced samples . the number of  <dig>  detected transcripts in globin-reduced samples is achieved at a sequencing depth of ~ <dig> million reads while the same number of transcripts is detected at a sequencing depth of ~ <dig> million reads in the non-globin reduced samples. in silico analysis was performed to determine at which sampling rate the threshold of at least  <dig> tags in  <dig> out the  <dig> samples was reached. the difference in detected transcripts between the reduced and non-reduced samples at any given sequencing depth remained equal, indicating that even at a very large numbers of reads  whole blood samples are not sequenced to saturation .

two non-globin-reduced samples were sequenced twice, at low and high sequencing depths, and compared to the sequencing results from the same samples with reduction of the globin transcripts.

discussion
we performed globin transcript reduction on rna from human peripheral blood to investigate if this improved the sensitivity of sage digital gene expression profiling. in the non-reduced samples, globin percentages were highly variable between samples and ranged from 52% to 76%. these numbers match previous reports for globin transcript abundances in blood  <cit> . the globin reduction process with biotinylated oligonucleotides complementary to globin transcripts was successful since there was a >  <dig> % reduction in globin transcripts. this was consistent with previous studies  <cit> . we observed that after globin reduction there was a slight decrease in total rna quality as well as an rna yield loss of 5-9%. the slight reduction in rna quality and yield had no effect on the quality of the data. from the  <dig>  transcripts that were detected across all  <dig> samples,  <dig>  transcripts were detected at significantly higher levels in the  <dig> globin reduced samples, while only  <dig> transcripts were reported as detected at significantly lower levels. we can not explain why there were transcripts, other than the globin transcripts, found to be expressed at lower levels in the globin reduced samples. in silico analysis showed that this was not likely due to cross hybridization with the globin transcripts or with the globin oligonucleotides from the globin reduction kit.

we detected robust expression of  <dig> transcripts in globin reduced samples that could not be detected in non-globin reduced samples. this is similar to what has been previously reported using classical microarray gene expression platforms  <cit> . the important advantage of more detectable transcripts is that there will be increased statistical power to detect differences between samples. furthermore, this increased number of detected transcripts after globin reduction provides more information about low abundance transcripts that could give new insights into the underlying disease mechanism.

the reduction of globin transcripts provides a practical and reproducible method for improving the number of transcripts detected in human peripheral whole blood samples, and reduces required sequencing capacity by a factor two. deep sage is a technique that detects short tags of 21- <dig> base pairs representing specific transcripts. for this reason the data complexity is lower compared to other digital gene expression profiling techniques such as whole transcriptome sequencing . for rna-seq, where the aim is to also identify all the transcript isoforms, saturation is definitely not reached at  <dig> million reads, which would make globin transcript reduction in blood even more advantageous for rna-seq.

CONCLUSIONS
the reduction of globin transcripts together with whole blood collection methods, such as the pax system, constitutes a reproducible and reliable method that increases the number of transcripts detected in next generation sequencing-based gene expression profiling. this will increase the statistical power to detect disease relevant signatures in patient-control studies.
