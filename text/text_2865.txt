BACKGROUND
depression causes various health problems, and eating disorders such as loss of appetite are the major symptoms of depression
 <cit> . we investigated the molecular mechanisms of depression-induced symptom of anorexia with an animal model of depression. rats were exposed to csds using a resident-intruder paradigm as previously described
 <cit> . the csds rats showed decreased body weight gain and food intake
 <cit> . because feeding behavior is regulated by the central nervous system, in particular the hypothalamus, we focused on the hypothalamic signal molecules and metabolites that were related to feeding behaviors in csds rats
 <cit> .

leptin is known a potent anorexic peptide hormone, and it is synthesized by adipose tissues
 <cit> . in general, a decreased fat volume in the body  induces the reduction of the peripheral leptin concentration and increases food intake
 <cit> . conversely, an increased fat volume in the body induces an increased peripheral leptin concentration and reduced food intake
 <cit> . the participation of leptin in depression was described in depressive patients and depressive animal models. one study reported that leptin levels did not differ between depressive patients and healthy controls
 <cit> . other reports described plasma leptin levels that were higher in depressive patients, with a bias in female patients
 <cit> . in animal depression models, lu et al. described subjects with both chronic social defeat stress and chronic mild stress that had decreased plasma leptin concentrations but did not have a change in body weight; they also reported that leptin had an antidepressant-like activity
 <cit> . furthermore, chuang et al. described that csds reduced body weight and plasma leptin concentration
 <cit> .

recently, we reported that csds rats showed a decrease in food intake and inhibition of body weight gain
 <cit> . furthermore, csds rats showed an increased concentration of hypothalamic malonyl-coa because of the inhibition of ampk and the activation of acc
 <cit> . hypothalamic malonyl-coa is also known to play a pivotal role in feeding behavior and malonyl-coa is synthesized from acetyl-coa by acc
 <cit> . acc is phosphorylated and inactivated by ampk
 <cit> . malonyl-coa is a known intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis and is synthesized from acetyl-coa by acc. acc is phosphorylated and inactivated by ampk
 <cit> . hypothalamic ampk is a pivotal protein kinase in the malonyl-coa signaling pathway, and its activity is inhibited by leptin and glucose
 <cit> . in general, rats which showed suppressed body weight gain show reduced peripheral leptin concentration and increased food intake. however, csds rats showed suppressed body weight gain and decreased food intake
 <cit> . therefore, we focused on the peripheral leptin and its hypothalamic downstream signal molecules which are upstream regulators of malonyl-coa in the csds rats.

in this study, we focused on peripheral leptin expression and its downstream hypothalamic signaling pathway and blood plasma components including protein, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose in csds rats to elucidate the effectors for hypothalamic ampk and malonyl-coa signaling pathways in csds-induced symptom of anorexia.

RESULTS
effects of csds on body weight gain and epididymal fat weight
body weight was measured at the end of the control phase  and at weekly intervals during the stress phase. prior to stress exposure, the body weights of the csds and the control rats were similar . in this study, the csds rats showed a suppression in body weight gain compared to the control rats . a two-way repeated measures anova revealed that stress had a significant effect on body weight gain  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), and the stress × time interaction was significant  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). furthermore, csds rats showed decreased food intake during the dark phase . a two-way repeated measures anova revealed that stress had a significant effect on food intake  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), and the stress × time interaction was significant  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). next, we measured epididymal fat in the csds rats. the weight of epididymal fat in the csds rats was significantly less than that of the control rats . there was no significant difference in the ratio of epididymal fat weight to body weight between the csds and the control . these results indicated that the csds rats in this study showed suppressed body weight gain and food intake similar to previous our study and decreased epididymal fat in the csds rat was occurred with suppressed body weight gain
 <cit> .

effects of csds on blood components
we analyzed the total concentration of protein, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose in the blood plasma. the total protein and glucose concentrations in the plasma of the csds rats were only slightly reduced compared to the control rats . the total cholesterol concentration in the plasma of csds rats was decreased significantly compared to the control rats . however, the plasma triglyceride level was not significantly changed in the csds rats .

effects of csds on leptin signals
next, we evaluated leptin expression in the white adipose tissue and its hypothalamic intracellular downstream molecules  under the csds condition. we observed that the csds rats have significantly lower expression of leptin mrna in the white adipose tissue than the control rats . secondly, we analyzed the plasma leptin concentration, and we observed that in the csds rats, the plasma leptin concentration was significantly decreased . moreover, we observed significantly decreased phosphorylation of stat <dig> and erk1/ <dig> in the hypothalamus of csds rats. the levels of erk1/ <dig> and stat <dig> protein expression in the hypothalamus were similar between the csds and control rats , whereas the ratios of phospho-erk1/2/erk1/ <dig> and phospho-stat3/stat <dig> were significantly lower in the csds rats . these results indicated that decreased leptin concentration in the plasma was occurred by decreased expression of leptin mrna in the white adipose tissue. furthermore, phosphorylation of stat <dig> and erk1/ <dig> in the hypothalamus was not conflict with leptin concentration in the plasma.

discussion
depression often induces symptom of anorexia and a severe reduction in the body weight of subjects with some disrupted hypothalamic regulation feeding behaviors
 <cit> . to elucidate the mechanism of loss of appetite induced by csds and depression, we evaluated the levels of peripheral leptin, its downstream hypothalamic signals and blood components such as protein, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose in csds rats that were obtained using a resident-intruder paradigm.

in this study, csds significantly reduced body weight gain and epididymal fat, but it did not specifically induce the accumulation of epididymal fat. there are some reports describing the relationship between csds and body weight change. body weight loss was observed in csds mice obtained by a ten-day session of a social defeat paradigm with resident mice  and intruder mice 
 <cit> . the intruder’s body weight was quickly reduced with exposure to the social defeat paradigm, but after a ten-day session of the csds program, the body weight of the defeated intruders increased faster than the controls
 <cit> . another report described that the duration of the physical contacts in the csds paradigm is critical for stress-induced body weight change. savignac et al. developed a short-term version of the csds paradigm that allow only one contact between the resident and intruder
 <cit> . in this short-term version of the csds paradigm, the c57bl/6 j intruder’s body weight increased
 <cit> . in our study, the csds rats did not have body weight loss, but they instead displayed reduced body weight gain 
 <cit> . this discrepancy may be due to differences of experimental animals and csds paradigms. in the future, the patterns of body weight changes in depressive patients should be compared with animal models of depression to understand the roles of weight loss and obesity in depression.

depression also affects the concentration of some blood components
 <cit> . using metabolic analyses, we found that csds induces various changes of the metabolites in the blood plasma . in this study, we analyzed plasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and protein levels using conventional biochemical techniques. some studies reported that low concentrations of cholesterol are associated with mood disorders such as major depression
 <cit> . engelberg reported that low concentrations of serum cholesterol may decrease serotonin concentrations in the brain and fail to suppress aggressive behavior
 <cit> . furthermore, leptin and cholesterol are known to be decreased in the depressive patients
 <cit> . moreover, leptin is also related to decreased serotonin concentration in the depressive patients through regulating serotonin turnover
 <cit> . thus, our csds rats are a suitable model of animal depression for understanding cholesterol metabolism during depression. indeed, chuang et al. reported that csds induced disrupted regulation of lipid synthesis. their model which is increased body weight by exposed csds increased expression of genes involved in the fatty acid synthesis and decreased expression of genes involved in the fatty acid utilization in the liver. however, they reported that csds and high-fat diet induced increased total cholesterol and no changed triglycerides in the tissue
 <cit> . therefore, we need to investigate expression of genes related lipid synthesis.

next, we focused on peripheral leptin expression and its hypothalamic downstream signals in csds rats. leptin is a potent anorexigenic peptide hormone and is synthesized by white adipose tissues. peripheral leptin can enter into the brain tissues through the brain blood barrier and activate the stat <dig> and mapk cascades by binding leptin receptors
 <cit> . leptin is one of the upstream ligands for the malonyl-coa signaling pathway in the hypothalamus. the concentration of hypothalamic malonyl-coa regulates the expression of neuropeptides and controls the feeding behavior
 <cit> . administration of c <dig>  a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, induced an increase in the malonyl-coa concentration, affected the expression of neuropeptides in the hypothalamus and decreased food intake
 <cit> . malonyl-coa is synthesized from acetyl-coa by acc, and the acc activity is regulated by ampk. therefore, leptin and malonyl-coa signaling pathways in the hypothalamus play a pivotal role in feeding behaviors. moreover, the relationship between leptin and mood disorders was investigated. depressive patients and socially defeated rats had decreased leptin concentrations in their blood plasma
 <cit> . recently, we reported that csds rats showed suppressed food intake and body weight gain following an increase in their hypothalamic malonyl-coa concentration
 <cit> . therefore, we focused on the mechanism of the elevation of hypothalamic malonyl-coa levels in csds-induced symptom of anorexia. we first observed peripheral leptin expression and its hypothalamic action. the expression of leptin mrna in the csds rat fat tissue was significantly lower than that of the control rats . furthermore, the leptin blood plasma concentration in the csds rats was significantly lower . previous studies indicated that rats exposed to ten-day sessions of social defeat stress showed decreased plasma leptin concentrations; however, the stressed rats did not show any body weight change
 <cit> . in depressive patients, decreased plasma leptin concentrations and no significant body mass indices changes were observed
 <cit> . csds most likely suppressed the expression of the leptin gene in the fat tissue and decreased the plasma leptin concentration. the mechanisms of its inhibition by csds are unknown. leptin is also known to regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which showed abnormality in depressive patient and anorexic patient
 <cit> . furthermore, leptin inhibits adrenocortical steroid production including aldosterone and corticosterone
 <cit> . therefore, there is a possibility that our csds rats also indicate abnormality of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. furthermore, we evaluated the downstream hypothalamic signal transduction of leptin in csds rats. hypothalamic phosphorylation of stat <dig> and erk1/ <dig> in csds rats were not conflict with peripheral leptin levels in the csds rats. as described by gao et al., intraventricular administration of leptin increased the phosphorylation of hypothalamic stat <dig> and decreased that of ampk and acc, following an increase in the malonyl-coa concentration and a decrease in food intake
 <cit> . however, csds rats showed decreased food intake during the dark phase . therefore, csds may disrupt some hypothalamic signaling pathways from leptin receptors to ampk. our previous data showed decreased hypothalamic phospho-ampk and food intake in csds rats
 <cit> . adiponectin is also known to relate to feeding behavior and loss of appetite
 <cit> . therefore, the activity of adiponectin in csds rats should be investigated in the future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
symptom of anorexia was induced in our csds rats, and they had suppressed body weight gain following a decrease of phospho-ampk in the hypothalamus. we also observed the down-regulation of peripheral leptin and hypothalamic downstream signals of the leptin receptor. furthermore, the blood glucose concentration had a tendency to decrease in csds rats. thus, the inhibition of ampk and the elevation of the malonyl-coa concentration in the hypothalamus of csds rats as previously reported were independent of peripheral glucose and leptin signals. together, these data suggest that csds downregulates hypothalamic ampk following elevation of malonyl-coa via some unknown factors that should be elucidated in future studies.
