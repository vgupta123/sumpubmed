BACKGROUND
as ancestral metazoans  <cit>  , cnidarians provide an interesting system within which to study mutational processes. cnidarians do not possess a sequestered germ line  <cit>  and their members have a large diversity of life cycles, main adult stages , reproduction strategies  and morphological plasticity. cnidarians also frequently harbor intra-cellular symbionts, the presence of which may, on the one hand, increase the amount of mutagens  in host tissues  <cit> , but on the other might exert pressure to limit genetic change, ensuring continued communication between partners  <cit> . some of the differences in longevity, life cycle, morphology and symbiotic relationships across the cnidaria might be related to differences in genomic composition or mutation rates  <cit> . for example, cnidarians with short-lived medusa stages have faster mitochondrial mutation rates than cnidarians with long life spans and no medusa stages  <cit> .figure  <dig>

microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  are sequences of no more than  <dig> basepairs , repeated tandemly  <cit> . point mutations and substitutions are responsible for producing proto-microsatellites . once proteo-microsatellites are formed mutation rates will increase with increasing repeat length, until new mutations or substitutions stabilize mutation rates and the microsatellite sequence  <cit> . dna polymerase slippage and unequal recombination have been proposed to explain microsatellite expansion, and instability  <cit> , while the frequency of microsatellites is associated with the presence of transposable elements  <cit> .

microsatellite loci are genomic features well suited for the study of mutational processes. apart from high mutation rates, they influence a variety of phenotypic traits from skeletal morphology to host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . recent studies suggest that microsatellites play an important, direct role in genome evolution because microsatellites may affect dna replication, translation and gene expression . for example, in some disease-associated microsatellites, increases in repeat length can originate replication and chromosome rearrangement. in microsatellites located within coding or promoter regions, mutations in the repeats can modify patterns of gene expression.

microsatellites have been found in every genome studied  <cit> , and taxon-specific variation in microsatellite types and distribution are common  <cit> . previous studies concluded that tetranucleotides are more abundant than trinucleotides in vertebrates, while di- and trinucleotides are more abundant in invertebrates  <cit> . some microsatellite features such as motif size and class can differ even among closely related species  <cit> ; for example, extensive variation has been observed among drosophila species  <cit> . the phylogenetic signal of microsatellites depends on the studied feature, for example, the relative abundance of ac and gc motifs and the average lengths of dinucleotides and trinucleotides appear to be conserved in most animals  <cit> . however, even when microsatellite composition is similar for closely related species, the relationship deteriorates as the evolutionary distance between species increases  <cit> .

comparisons of microsatellite abundances, lengths and repeat types within and among species have shed some light on the way genomes evolve  <cit> . microsatellite types differ with their position in the genome, genome size does not correlate with the amount of microsatellites it contains, and mutation rates increase with microsatellite lengths. in cnidaria, comparisons of the two sequenced genomes: nematostella vectensis
 <cit>  and hydra magnipapillata
 <cit>  showed noticeable differences in genome size, base composition, gene conservation and content of transposable elements; however, microsatellite abundance and frequency were not analyzed  <cit> .

the objectives of this work were: 1) to describe the microsatellite abundance and composition in different members of the cnidaria with focus on the anthozoa and hydrozoa, 2) to detect a phylogenetic signal in microsatellite abundance and composition and to 3) correlate the mitochondrial genome mutation rates and the presence of intra-cellular symbionts to microsatellite abundance and composition. we further provide resources for the design of microsatellite primers for future studies of cnidarian populations.

RESULTS
proportion of sequences with microsatellites
we partially sequenced the genomes of the following cnidarians: black corals , candelabrum coral , the octocoral plumarella sp., strawberry anemone , giant mushroom anemone , plumose anemone , and fire coral . a total of  <dig>  sequences with a mean length of 474 bp and a mean trimmed sequence length of 192 bp were obtained from these eight cnidarian species. the sequences represent a quasi-random sample of a fraction of the eight species’ genomes. the overall proportion of sequences containing microsatellites varied among species, ranging from  <dig> % in the octocoral e. flexuosa to  <dig> % in the antipatharian l. glaberrima .table  <dig>

dna extracts from  <dig> of the species  might have contained dna from their intracellular symbionts, despite our efforts to isolate dna from symbiont-free tissue . thus, sequences containing microsatellites were aligned against a local database of symbiodinium sequences. sequences with more than 75% similarity to symbiodinium were eliminated . however, when aligning the putative symbiodinium sequences against the full ncbi database the top hits were not to symbiodinium. regardless, putative symbiodinium sequences were discarded from the analysis. the microsatellite cover was the same whether the putative symbiodinium sequences were included or not. microsatellite cover was also calculated for the symbiodinium clades, their values being either similar  or higher  than those of their hosts .

as a supplement to the eight species with partial genome sequences , scaffolds of whole genome sequences  of three other cnidarians were processed as above, including wgs of n. vectensis , h. magnipapillata  and a. digitifera . the proportion of sequences containing microsatellites in the wgs species ranged from  <dig> % in the scleractinian a. digitifera to  <dig> % in the anemone nematostella .

the microsatellite lengths  were also significantly different  among species . mean repeat numbers ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  for the pgs species and between  <dig> and  <dig> repeats for the wgs species. however, sequences with long microsatellites  were rare  in both wgs and pgs.figure  <dig>

phylogeny and ecology
a coi phylogeny of the studied species was constructed as a requirement to test evolutionary models of the microsatellite coverage, using a log-likelihood test. the coi tree showed the expected grouping of hydrozoa, octocorallia and hexacorallia . nematostella vectensis was basal to the hexacorallia, but the long branch in nematostella suggested increased levels of sequence divergence between nematostella and the other species. the corallimorpharia clustered with the scleractinian sequences while the antipatharia clustered with m. senile . the phylogeny also suggested that the actinaria  are paraphyletic.figure  <dig>

the log-likelihood test between phylogeny and coverage of microsatellite types suggested abundance follows a random walk evolutionary model . regressions  between phylogeny and coverage of microsatellite types were not significant, indicating there is no phylogenetic signal in the coverage and types of microsatellites. regressions  between phylogeny and microsatellite lengths yielded similar results.table  <dig>

the hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a weak phylogenetic signal for the coverage and length of microsatellites . the significant clusters in each analysis had approximated unbiased p-values  of >95% indicating that those clusters were supported by the data  <cit> . millepora alcicornis, e. flexuosa, a. fenestrafer and c. californica grouped by microsatellite coverage . thus, clustering by microsatellite coverage discriminated between symbiotic and non-symbiotic corals . the corallimorpharians, a. fenestrafer and c. californica clustered by length of microsatellites  making the corallimorpharia the only phylogenetic group recovered by the hierarchical clustering.figure  <dig>

non-symbiotic corals had about 6-fold higher microsatellite coverage than symbiotic corals , but the microsatellites were similar in lengths . microsatellite coverage of symbiodinium was higher than the microsatellite coverage found in their hosts . microsatellite coverage did not vary with rate of mitochondrial evolution  for microsatellite coverage , and microsatellite length .

discussion
here, we described microsatellite abundances and lengths in the phylum cnidaria with a focus on the anthozoa and hydrozoa. we investigated if these characters were predicted by phylogeny, mitochondrial mutation rates or ecology . when clustering the cnidarian species by microsatellite lengths and microsatellite coverage, only the two closely related corallimorpharian species grouped together; no phylogenetic signal was found in the clustering of the remaining  <dig> species representing higher taxonomic levels. a phylogenetic signal in microsatellite abundance and length in the cnidaria thus appears to be lost fairly rapidly, but more data is needed to support this finding.

interestingly, dinoflagellate-hosting cnidaria had 6-fold lower microsatellite coverage and different microsatellite composition from those that do not host dinoflagellates. this result contrasted with the microsatellite coverage of their main associated dinoflagellates, which had also  <dig> to  <dig> orders of magnitude higher microsatellite coverage then their hosts. these observations prompted the hypothesis that the close association with dinoflagellates might place restrictions on microsatellite coverage and composition in cnidarian genomes.

summary statistics
gc content is correlated with genomic features relevant in determining genome function like gene density, distribution of transposable elements and gene expression levels  <cit> . here, the average gc content in the microsatellite sequences varied between  <dig> and 43% . the gc content in the microsatellites did not differ among the studied species; thus the gc proportion in the microsatellites cannot explain differences in microsatellite abundance in the cnidaria.

microsatellite coverage in the partial genomes of eight species varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  suggesting a wide range of microsatellite coverage for the phylum. these results mirror previous studies in which the densities of microsatellites vary within phyla  <cit> .

microsatellites might influence genome evolution and, at the same time, the processes generating and maintaining microsatellites might be altered during the evolution of the genome  <cit> . clear signals in the abundance and type of microsatellite have been observed when comparing phyla and subphyla  <cit>  and when comparing sister species  <cit> , but microsatellite composition and coverage becomes more heterogeneous as the species divergence increases  <cit> . in this article, differences in the frequencies of microsatellite motif types were detected among the cnidarian species included. frequency of microsatellite types was similar for some of the closely related species , but differed for the other related group .

all theoretically possible combinations of mono- , di- , tri-  and tetranucleotide  motifs were present in the pgs species. eighty-nine of the  <dig> possible penta- and  <dig> of the  <dig> possible hexanucleotides were also observed. pentameric and hexameric nucleotides generally have longer sequences  <cit> , and thus we might not have been able to detect them because read lengths from  <dig> gs fxl titanium had means of 192 bp after trimming.

di-, tri- and tetranucleotides are the most abundant microsatellites in invertebrates  <cit> , and this generally holds true for the cnidaria. ac was the most frequent dinucleotide motif found in the studied species. this motif is also common in other metazoans, such as vertebrates and arthropods  <cit> . cg motifs are rare in cnidaria as well as in other metazoans  <cit> . in this dataset, aat, atc, aac and act were the most abundant trinucleotides motifs. interestingly, act was reported as rare in most of the previously sequenced vertebrate and invertebrate taxa  <cit> , but is frequent in the cnidaria. for example, act constitutes 40% of the trinucleotides observed in millepora .

repeat number, length  and motif type are indicators of microsatellite mutation rates  <cit> . a greater number of repeats increases the probability of slippage and thus increases the mutability of the microsatellite  <cit> . mapping the location and identity of our microsatellites is not possible and, therefore, we cannot directly estimate mutation rate. however, based on the fact that mutability increases with microsatellite length  <cit>  we suggest that the significant differences in average repeat lengths among cnidarian species  might indicate differing mutation rates among species. further studies are required to test this hypothesis.

phylogenetic signal of microsatellite characteristics
previous studies  <cit>  suggested that some microsatellite features  might be related to the evolutionary history of the species and, therefore, those features should be concordant with the species’ phylogeny. to test this hypothesis in the anthozoa and hydrozoa, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis and bayesian regressions on the proportion of microsatellite motifs and the microsatellite lengths.

the hierarchical cluster analyses suggested a weak phylogenetic signal for the coverage of microsatellite within the cnidaria at the order level . additional sub-family sampling is required before conclusions can be drawn about the similarity of microsatellite coverage among members of the same family. however, other studies suggest that increasing the number of species in a phylogenetic group usually increases the heterogeneity of the microsatellite composition and coverage  <cit> .

the phylogenetic regression showed no relationship between microsatellite abundance or microsatellite length and phylogeny, suggesting evolution of these microsatellite characters was random. however, the dominance of di-, tri- and tetranucleotide motifs was shared between the anthozoa and the hydrozoa, the most distantly related cnidarians  <cit>  , suggesting that di-, tri- and tetranucleotide dominance might be the ancestral microsatellite state for cnidaria. these results compare with the conclusions of ross et al.  <cit>  that the phylogenetic signal derived from microsatellite patterns depends on the microsatellite features under study.

symbiotic signal of microsatellite features
members of the cnidaria have diverse symbiotic relationships and this diversity might be related to differences in genomic composition or mutation rates  <cit> . we explored if, presence of intracellular algal symbionts in the genus symbiodinium, and host mtdna mutation rates were associated with microsatellite coverage and/or microsatellite length.

the symbiotic corals had 6-fold lower microsatellite coverage than the non-symbiotic corals. similarly, the microsatellite coverage in symbiodinium was up to 6-fold higher than the microsatellite coverage in their coral hosts. therefore, difference in microsatellite coverage cannot be attributed to contamination by symbiodinium sequences . the methods used for tissue collection and dna extractions were biased against symbiodinium, reducing the chances of overrepresentation of symbiodinium sequences: dna was extracted from symbiodinium-free eggs , bleached colonies , or the base of the anemone’s foot . thus the number of symbionts was expected to be low  <cit> . the studied coral sequences were then aligned against sequences from various symbiodinium clades  to remove potential contaminants. the frequency and type of microsatellites found in the only published symbiodinium genome  <cit>  was higher or similar to that of the studied corals. therefore, we concluded that a potential contamination with symbiodinium sequences would have increased microsatellite coverage, instead of decreasing it.

the intracellular nature of the symbiosis demands tight communication between the partners  <cit>  and thus it is conceivable that the symbiotic state selects for stable host genomes. alternatively, factors that co-vary with symbiosis state might explain the differences in microsatellite coverage. the symbiotic species included in this study occur in high temperature and light environments. high light and temperature combined with the mutation stress from reactive oxygen produced as a by-product of photosynthesis by their symbionts might select for efficient dna repair mechanisms in these long-lived species. to further investigate if microsatellite coverage is influenced by symbionts or light/temperature stress, future work would benefit from the addition of a non-symbiotic tropical cnidarian .

previous studies suggested differences between nuclear and mitochondrial dna mutation rates across the cnidaria . for example, the mitochondrial genomes of the anthozoa have low mutation rates, while the mitochondrial genomes of medusozoa  have mutation rates similar to more complex animals  <cit> . slow mutation rates in the mitochondrial dna point to efficient dna repair mechanisms ; however, cnidarian nuclear allozymes and microsatellite markers show high heterozygosity indicative of high mutation rates .

we considered wgs and pgs species together to compare microsatellite abundances and lengths between cnidaria with slow mtdna mutation rates  and cnidaria with fast mtdna mutation rates , and found no difference . while additional samples from the meduzosoa and hydrozoa  would strengthen the comparison, our results lend some support to the idea that dna repair is efficient in the medusozoa and hydrozoa but mitochondrion-specific.

CONCLUSIONS
this study broadens our understanding of microsatellite distributions in non-model invertebrates. almost every theoretically possible microsatellite motif was found. trinucleotides and tetranucleotides were the most common microsatellites in the cnidaria, challenging the convention that penta and hexanucleotides are most frequent in all nonvertebrate taxa  <cit> .

cnidarian species showed differences in microsatellite densities, between symbiotic and non-symbiotic cnidarians. lower microsatellite coverage, although not lengths, in symbiotic corals suggest that either the symbiotic state itself or factors that co-vary with it, such as high light and high temperature, place restrictions on the host genome. inclusion of non-symbiotic tropical cnidarians will be informative in this regard.
