BACKGROUND
retinoic acid  is a biologically active derivative of vitamin a. two major isoforms of ra, all-trans ra  and 9-cis ra , have been identified. atra is normally present at high levels in the developing spinal cord and at low levels in the forebrain of mouse embryos . on the other hand, 9cra is not present in mouse embryos  <cit>  or tissue extracts from adult rats  <cit> . ras interact with two major groups of nuclear receptors: retinoic acid receptors  and retinoid x receptors . 9cra binds with high affinity to rxr  <cit> , whereas both 9cra and atra activate rar  <cit> .

ra has been reported to have protective effects after injury. ra inhibited h2o2-induced apoptosis via suppression of c-fos/c-jun expression and jnk activation in mesangial cells  <cit>  and increased survival during anoxia/glucose deprivation in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . these data suggest that ra can induce protective responses in cultured cells. the function of ra in the mature nervous system is less documented. pretreatment with docosahexaenoic acid , a candidate ligand for rxr  <cit> , reduced cerebral infarction induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion  <cit> . we previously reported that 9cra is more potent than atra in reducing ischemia –mediated brain infarction  <cit>  and, furthermore, pretreatment with 9cra attenuated dna fragmentation in the lesioned cerebral cortex of stroke rats  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that 9cra is neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia in vivo.

several reports also indicate that ra can reduce degeneration induced by dopaminergic neurotoxins in culture. ra attenuates 6-hydroxydopamine  and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium  -mediated neurotoxicity in sy5y neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . the protective effects of ra in these cells involves the akt pathway, increasing bcl <dig> while reducing p <dig> levels  <cit> . in rat midbrain slice cultures, treatment with a rar agonist am <dig> prevents ifn-r/lps –induced dopaminergic cell loss  <cit> . these data suggest that ra has protective effects in dopaminergic neurons in culture. one recent study has shown that systemic administration of a high dose of ra  for  <dig> days reversed rotenone –induced impairment of locomotor activity without significantly reversing the reduction of dopamine  in striatum  <cit> . in most of these studies, atra was used to examine the protective effect of ra against dopaminergic neurotoxins. the protective role of 9cra in dopaminergic neurons in an established model of pd has not been reported.

9cra has also been shown to induce protection in animal model of stroke  <cit> . application of a similar dose of atra did not reduce the size of infarction after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, suggesting that 9cra is more potent than atra in neuroprotection  <cit> . unlike atra, 9cra regulates the expression of proteins in the transforming growth factor  -β superfamily. 9cra enhances production of glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor , and bone morphogenetic protein- <dig>  protein  <cit> , in human neuroblastoma cells and u <dig> os cells, respectively. 9cra also increases midkin mrna in primary cortical neurons  <cit> . all these trophic factors or proteins have been reported to reduce stroke insults  <cit> .

we previously demonstrated that intracerebroventricular administration of 9cra time-dependently upregulates bmp <dig> mrna expression in rodent brain  <cit> . the 9cra –mediated reduction in cerebral infarction in stroke rats was significantly antagonized by the bmp antagonist noggin  <cit> , suggesting that 9cra induces protection through bmp <dig>  interestingly, bmp <dig> has been shown to reduce dopaminergic neurotoxins –mediated neurodegeneration in vivo and in vitro. bmp <dig> significantly reduced rotational behavior, partially preserved kcl- induced da release in the lesioned striatum, and increased tyrosine hydroxylase  immunoreactivity in lesioned nigra in unilaterally 6-ohda -lesioned rats  <cit> . similarly, bmp <dig> antagonized high dose methamphetamine –induced da cell loss in cultured dopaminergic neurons and striatal th fiber density reduction in vivo <cit> . knocking down bmp <dig> or bmprii receptors expression in mice increased sensitivity to dopaminergic neurotoxins in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . these data suggest that bmp <dig> has protective effects against da-ergic neurotoxin –mediated degeneration. since 9cra enhances bmp <dig> expression, we reasoned it may also induce protection against 6-ohda lesioning in an animal model of parkinson’s disease  through the bmp <dig> pathway.

in this study, we examined the protective effect of 9cra in a rodent animal model of pd. 9cra was given at low dose from  <dig> days after unilateral 6-ohda lesioning in adult rats. we found that post-treatment with 9cra significantly reduced rotational behavior while increased the survival of dopamine cells in the lesioned nigra and kcl-evoked da release in lesioned striatum. our data suggest that 9cra induces neuroprotection against neurodegeneration in nigrostriatal da neurons in an animal model of pd.

RESULTS
vm cell cultures
we first examined protective effects of 9cra in ventromesenphalic  neuronal culture. cells were fixed at  <dig> hours after 6-ohda treatment. typical th immunoreactivity of vm cultured cells is demonstrated in figure 1a. treatment with 6-ohda dose-dependently reduced th  cell density . 9cra or vehicle was given at  <dig> hours after addition of 6-ohda or vehicle to the well. treatment with 9cra  did not alter th cell density in non-lesioned cells; however, 9cra significantly attenuated 6-ohda-medated loss of th cells at  <dig> hours after lesioning . we also found that 6-ohda treatment enhanced the density of tunel labeling. 9cra significantly reduced 6-ohda –mediated tunel activity .

we previously demonstrated that 9cra is more potent than atra against ischemic brain injury in vivo. similarly, we found that 9cra is more efficient that atra against 6-ohda –mediated neurodegeneration in vm th neurons. more th neurons survived post-treated with 9cra, compared to atra, after 6-ohda lesioning .

animal study
 rotation
a total of  <dig> rats received unilateral 6-ohda lesioning on day  <dig>  methamphetamine -induced rotational behavior was examined on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after 6-ohda lesioning. animals were separated into  <dig> groups  to equalize group rotational behavior and thus lesion extent on day  <dig>  two animals were excluded because the rotation was higher than  <dig> turns/hour to avoid maximal lesioning before neural protective treatment. there was no difference in rotation prior to 9cra or vehicle treatment between these two groups . averaged rotation  was  <dig>  +/−  <dig>   and  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  . animals were treated with 9cra or veh from day  <dig> to day  <dig> . the rotational behavior was re-examined on days  <dig> and  <dig> after lesioning . using a two way anova, we determined that 9cra, compared to vehicle, significantly reduced methamphetamine -mediated rotation in the unilaterally 6-ohda-lesioned rats .

 kcl-induced da release and da clearance in striatum
kcl-evoked da release in striatum was examined using in vivo voltammetry in  <dig> rats at > <dig> months after unilateral 6-ohda injection. five of these animals were treated with 9cra and the other six were treated with vehicle. kcl-evoked da release was recorded in  <dig> striatal sites between  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm below the brain surface and  <dig> - <dig>  mm lateral, 0– <dig> mm anterior to bregma. of these,  <dig> sites were taken from the striatum ipsilateral  to the 6-ohda injection while  <dig> sites were recorded in the contralateral  striatum. average dose of kcl ejected from micropipette was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nl per site. local application of kcl resulted in release of dopamine in all sites in non-lesioned  striatum in both 9cra and vehicle -treated mice. on the other hand, the peak of da release was reduced in the lesioned striatum. typical extracellular dopamine tracings from left and right striatum are shown in figure  <dig> 

previous voltammetric studies have shown a dose response relationship between the peak of extracellular da level and log dose of applied da through a micropipette in rat striatum  <cit> . in this study, the amplitude of da release was thus normalized by comparison to the log volume  of kcl used. a similar approach has been used in our previous papers  <cit> . there is a significant reduction in kcl-evoked da release in the lesioned striatum, compared to the non-lesioned striatum  in both vehicle and 9cra treated animals . however, treatment with 9cra significantly increased kcl-evoked da release in the lesioned side striatum , compared to vehicle. no difference was found in the non-lesioned side striatum between 9cra and vehicle –treated animals  .

the rate of da clearance  after kcl application was calculated by measuring the slope between t <dig> and t <dig>  of the da currents, as described previously  <cit> . there was a significant reduction of da clearance in the lesioned side striatum . treatment with 9cra significantly increased da clearance rate in the lesioned side striatum  compared to vehicle.

 th immunoreactivity in nigra
th immunoreactivity was studied at > <dig> months after unilateral 6-ohda lesioning, th-positive  cell number in sn and in vta were counted in  <dig> rats. typical th immunostaining of 6-ohda -lesioned animals receiving either 9cra or vehicle treatment is shown in figure  <dig>  injection of 6-ohda consistently reduced th  cell number in sn in either vehicle or 9cra –treated animals . treatment with 9cra significantly increased th  cell number in the lesioned side sn  compared to vehicle. no change was found in the contralateral  side sn . although there is a trend that a <dig> th cell number can be suppressed by 6-ohda lesioning, there is no significant difference after lesioning or after 9cra treatment .

discussion
in this study, we found that density of th  neurons and fibers in primary vm cultures were dose dependently reduced at  <dig> days after 6-hydroxydopamine treatment. 6-ohda also induced dna fragmentation as demonstrated in tunel labeling. these data are in agreement with our previous studies and suggest that administration of 6-ohda causes activation of apoptotic pathways that lead to the death of vm dopaminergic neurons. we found that early and post treatment with 9cra reduced 6-ohda -mediated injury in vm cells. 6-ohda -mediated reduction of th cell density was significantly antagonized by 9cra, suggesting that 9cra is neuroprotective against 6-ohda -mediated neurodegeneration in dopaminergic neurons in vitro.

previous studies have demonstrated that ra exerts anti-apoptotic and antioxidant activity in neuronal and kidney cells. ra reduced staurosporine-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis by preventing the decrease in the levels of cu-,zn-superoxide dismutase  and mn-superoxide dismutase  in primary hippocampal cultures  <cit>  and by facilitating ngf-induced protection in chick embryonic neurons  <cit> . ra suppressed hydrogen peroxide –induced apoptotic nuclear condensation and membrane blebbing in rat glomeruli mesangial cells. our recent studies also indicated that 9cra reduced the density of tunel labeling, a marker for apoptosis/necrosis in ischemic cortex after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that treatment with 9cra reduced 6-ohda-mediated dna fragmentation in culture. taken together, our data suggest that 9cra inhibits apoptosis and/or necrosis induced by 6-ohda.

using an established rodent model of pd, we also demonstrated the protective effect of 9cra in vivo. administration of amphetamine analogs causes ipislateral rotation in unilaterally 6-ohda -lesioned rats due to differential increase of dopaminergic activity on the intact side. there is a correlation between amphetamine–induced ipislateral rotation and the depletion of dopamine in the nigra  <cit> . in this study, 9cra was given after rotation experiment on day  <dig> post lesioning. we separated animals to  <dig> groups to balance rotational behavior before treatment; the difference in lesioning prior to treatment was thus minimal between two groups. we demonstrated that post-treatment with 9cra, compared to vehicle, significantly attenuated rotation. our data support that early and post-treatment with 9cra reduced behavioral imbalance in hemiparkinsonian rats.

the protective effect of 9cra is further supported by in vivo electrochemical data at  <dig> months after lesioning. we used high speed chronoamperometry to examine the time course of kcl -evoked da release and clearance in striatum. the dose of kcl applied locally was between 7– <dig> × 10- <dig> mole  per site. the dose, concentration and volume of the kcl solution have been previously reported to induce depolarization and release of dopamine at dopaminergic nerve terminals in vivo <cit> . we found that local administration of kcl induced da release equally in the non-lesioned side striatum in 9cra or vehicle –treated rats. in the lesioned side striatum, kcl-evoked da release and the rate of da clearance were greatly diminished in animals receiving vehicle treatment. treatment with 9cra did not induce a full recovery but significantly increased kcl-evoked da release and da clearance in the lesioned side striatum. these electrochemical data support that post-treatment with 9cra protects against 6-ohda –mediated deficiency in da function in striatum.

using unbiased stereology, we demonstrated that post-treatment with 9cra significantly reduced the loss of th cells in nigra. in contrast to a 95% reduction in th cells in the lesion side nigra in animals with vehicle treatment, 70% th  neurons were lost in the lesioned animals with 9cra treatment. similarly, there was about 99% reduction in kcl-evoked da release in striatum in vehicle -treated animals. the reduction in da release was only 66% after 9cra treatment. taken together, our data suggest that 9cra has a protective effect against 6-ohda injury in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. it has been reported that the symptoms of the pd appear when 70-80% dopamine is depleted in patients  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that early treatment with 9cra can reduce the death of da neurons to 70%. it is thus possible that post-treatment with 9cra can be beneficial to pd patients by slowing down its progressive neurodegeneration.

we previously demonstrated that 9cra can selectively induce bmp <dig> mrna expression in the brain. in this study, we demonstrated that 9cra reduced 6-ohda -mediated program cell death in culture. bmp <dig> has anti-apoptotic properties. bmps reduced caspase- <dig> activation and dna fragmentation in the ischemic brain  <cit>  and attenuated dopaminergic neurotoxin -mediated apoptosis and cell death in nigrostriatal da neurons. interestingly, the reduction of tunel labeling by 9cra in stroke brain was antagonized by the bmp antagonist noggin. taken together, these data suggest that the protective effects of 9cra may be indirectly mediated through a bmp signaling mechanism.

ra analogs, such as 9cra and atra, are agonists for rxr and rar receptors. compared to atra, 9cra is a more selective agonist for rxr. although both atra and 9cra are neural protective against oxygen-glucose deprivation in hippocampal neurons  <cit> , a differential sensitivity of these two ligands have been seen in other brain regions. animals pretreated with 9cra had lesser cortical infarction than those treated with atra after middle cerebral artery occlusion  <cit> . using rtpcr, we also found that 9cra is more potent than atra in inducing bmp <dig>  and midkine  <cit>  expression in primary cortical cultures. we demonstrated here that 9cra is more potent than atra, at  <dig> nm, against 6-ohda –mediated neurodegeneration in th neuronal culture. taken together, these differential responses of 9cra suggest that neuroprotection induced by 9cra involves activation of rxr.

although 9cra has a high affinity for rxr, it is not detectable in adult brain tissue and, thus, may not be a candidate endogenous ligand for this receptor. studies have indicated that the polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linolenic and docosahexaenoic acid, activate rxr  <cit> . these polyunsaturated fatty acids have also been reported to reduce neurodegeneration  <cit> . future experiments are required to investigate the mechanism of protection induced by these polyunsaturated fatty acids and their effects on rxr in animal model of pd.

there are several limitations to deliver drug to brain days after onset of 6-ohda lesioning. drugs given systemically may not easily cross the blood brain barrier  and can be degraded through first pass metabolism. intracerebral delivery is not feasible for repeated drug administration and may require chronic cannulation. previous reports have indicated that small molecules can by-pass the bbb and reach brain parenchyma non-invasively through an intranasal delivery. in this study, 9cra was given initially through i.c.v. and then repeatedly through an intra-nasal route. we found that intranasal administration of 9cra increased brain 9cra level to  <dig> ng/g or  <dig> nm at  <dig> hour after delivery as detected by lc-ms/ms analysis . no 9cra was seen after vehicle treatment. previous studies have shown that 9cra can activate rxr receptor at this concentration  <cit> .

in a preliminary study, we treated 6-ohda –lesioned rats with intranasal 9cra without i.c.v injection from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  we did not find significant behavioral improvement after intranasal 9cra treatment and days  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that a loading dose of 9cra, given i.c.v. on day  <dig> is required for this protective reaction.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that 9cra, given from 7th day to 14th day post 6-ohda lesioning, reduced rotational behavior and loss of th cells in nigra, while increased da release function in striatum. our data suggest that 9cra has neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration in a rodent model of pd. the protection may be more prominent if 9cra is given earlier or prior to lesioning. the effectiveness of 9cra may be clinically useful for patients at early stages of pd.
