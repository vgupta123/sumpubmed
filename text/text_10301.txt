BACKGROUND
the process in which cholesterol is transported from peripheral cells, including those in the arterial wall, to the liver for excretion is termed reverse cholesterol transport. a key player in reverse cholesterol transport is the high density lipoprotein . the process can be divided into three stages: 1) the efflux of cellular cholesterol to hdl from peripheral cells, 2) the transport of hdl-cholesterol in blood to the liver, and 3) the delivery of cholesterol esters to hepatocytes from hdl  <cit> . the delivery of hdl cholesterol esters to the liver is mediated by scavenger receptor class b type i . sr-bi also mediates selective uptake of hdl-cholesterol esters into adrenals, testis and ovaries  <cit>  and cholesterol efflux to nascent hdl particles from macrophages and other peripheral cells  <cit> . sr-bi therefore plays an important role in both early and late stages in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway.

atp-binding cassette  transporter a <dig> , abundantly expressed in the liver and peripheral macrophages among other tissues, mediates the transfer of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid-poor apolipoprotein a-i  to form nascent hdl particles  <cit> . abcg <dig>  another member of the abc transporter family, has been suggested to be involved in cholesterol efflux to mature hdl and not to lipid-poor apoa-i  <cit> .

glucocorticoids are among the most widely used agents for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. glucocorticoids exert their diverse effects through the glucocorticoid receptor, gr. gr belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and functions as a ligand-inducible transcription factor  <cit> . in the nucleus, activated gr can interact with the regulatory regions of responsive genes to alter the level of gene expression  <cit> .

the aim of the present investigation was to study the role of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone in the regulation of abca <dig>  abcg <dig>  and sr-bi. here we show that dexamethasone-treatment increased the mrna expression of abca <dig>  abcg <dig>  and sr-bi in primary rat hepatocytes while an opposite tendency or no response was observed in hepg <dig> cells and thp- <dig> macrophages. we suggest that the observed inhibitory effect of dexamethasone is an unspecific/indirect effect since these cells express undetectable levels of gr protein. moreover, the gr antagonist mifepristone had no significant antagonistic effect in these cell lines. the inhibitory effect of insulin on the mrna expression was similar in primary rat hepatocytes, hepg <dig> cells and thp- <dig> macrophages.

RESULTS
dexamethasone and insulin exert opposite effects on the mrna expression of sr-bi, abca <dig>  and abcg <dig> in primary rat hepatocytes

the expression of sr-bi, abca <dig>  and abcg <dig> were analyzed in primary rat hepatocytes by real time rt-pcr and western blotting. as illustrated in figure 1a dexamethasone increased the abundance of sr-bi, abca <dig>  and abcg <dig> mrna. cells receiving insulin-treatment alone inhibited while treatment with both dexamethasone and insulin showed no significant effect on the mrna expression levels of sr-bi, abca <dig> or abcg <dig> compared to non-treated control cells indicating that insulin is capable of reversing the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone. in order to further evaluate the involvement of gr in the stimulatory actions of dexamethasone, mifepristone , a progesterone and glucocorticoid receptor antagonist  <cit>  was tested. the anti-glucocorticoid was shown to reduce the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone for all three target mrnas . these treatments did not, however, notably alter the protein levels of sr-bi, abca <dig>  and abcg <dig> . two well-documented hdl metabolism target genes for dexamethasone, cyp7a <dig>  <cit>  and apoa-i  <cit> , were also tested under the same conditions. as shown in figure 1c, the increased mrna expression coincides well with previous reports demonstrating a stimulatory effect of dexamethasone on both cyp7a <dig>  <cit>  and apoa-i  <cit>  expression in rat liver. the addition of insulin to these cells reduced the mrna levels and abolished the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone on both cyp7a <dig> and apoa-i expression. again, the gr antagonist mifepristone reduced the stimulatory effect of the gr agonist dexamethasone. thus the results presented in figure  <dig> show that dexamethasone and insulin have opposite effects on the mrna expression of sr-bi, abca <dig>  abcg <dig>  cyp7a <dig>  and apoa-i in primary rat hepatocytes and that the stimulatory effect most likely is via binding and activation of gr.

in hepg <dig> cells and thp- <dig> macrophages dexamethasone and insulin have similar effects on the mrna levels of sr-bi, abca <dig>  and abcg1

further observations in non-primary cells, such as the human hepatoma cell line hepg <dig> and the human macrophage-stimulated thp- <dig> cell line were carried out in order to test the effects of the two hormones in human-related cell systems. surprisingly dexamethasone inhibited the mrna expression of abca <dig> and abcg <dig> in both hepg <dig> cells  and thp- <dig> macrophages . the sr-bi mrna levels were reduced in hepg <dig> cells  while no effect could be observed in thp- <dig> macrophages . again, no obvious change in protein levels could be observed for abca <dig>  abcg <dig> or sr-bi after these treatments for either hepg <dig> cells  or thp- <dig> macrophages  . the addition of mifepristone did not antagonize the dexamethasone effect for any of our target genes  or reference genes . further experiments revealed, to our surprise, that the two cell lines indeed lack gr protein, at least compared to the expression level observed in primary rat hepatocytes . the negative effects on mrna expression observed with dexamethasone treatment in these cells  are therefore most likely unspecific or indirect. thus, these findings link the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone to the endogenous expression levels of gr in primary rat hepatocytes. as observed in primary rat hepatocytes , the effect of insulin was inhibitory on all the target mrnas indicating that the insulin effect is intact in the established cell lines compared to the primary cells.

discussion
in this report, we have examined the regulation of a set of genes important in reverse cholesterol transport. cells were treated with dexamethasone or insulin and mrna and protein levels were quantified by use of real time rt-pcr and western blotting, respectively. the data obtained show that dexamethasone treatment increased the mrna expression of abca <dig>  abcg <dig>  and sr-bi in primary rat hepatocytes while an opposite tendency was observed in hepg <dig> cells and thp- <dig> macrophages. it appears that the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone is specific/direct on the three target genes since it coincided well with the endogenous expression level of gr protein. this conclusion is further supported by the observation that the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone is reversed by the addition of the anti-glucocorticoid mifepristone. the negative effect of dexamethasone in thp- <dig> macrophages is in agreement with a previous study  <cit>  indicating that dexamethasone alone reduced while co-transfection with gr alone increased the abca <dig> promoter activity in raw <dig>  and thp- <dig> macrophages.

by the use of classical western blotting we were unable to detect any clear change in the protein expression of our target genes. as compared to real time rt-pcr, which can detect small changes in the levels of mrnas, western blotting is typically used for qualitative purposes and may therefore not display comparable changes in protein expression. the lack of effect of hormone treatments were nevertheless unexpected as earlier studies have shown that the protein levels of sr-bi respond within  <dig> hours to ppar  <cit> , fxr  <cit> , and pxr  <cit>  agonists. the dexamethasone treatment used in the present study should certainly be long enough to induce changes in protein levels. a plausible explanation for the lack of effect may be that it takes time before a detectable amount of protein is accumulated following dexamethasone treatment. this remains to be seen in future studies.

it is well recognized that glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone exerts catabolic actions while insulin exerts anabolic actions in carbohydrate metabolism. the present data show that dexamethasone and insulin may have opposite effects on cholesterol metabolism as well. one of the most important ways for the body to get rid of excess cholesterol is via the reverse cholesterol pathway and this pathway is tightly regulated by hormones and nutrients. since sr-bi is the major route by which hdl-cholesterol esters can enter into the hepatocytes, and hdl-cholesterol is the preferred substrate for bile acid synthesis  <cit> , the need for cooperative regulation of sr-bi and cyp7a <dig> is crucial in order to prevent accumulation of toxic high levels of bile acids. our results suggest that dexamethasone increases reverse cholesterol transport by increasing genes central in these processes while insulin most likely has the opposite role by reducing the expression of the same set of genes. moreover, our results are in agreement with a number of reports demonstrating that dexamethasone increases  <cit>  while insulin decreases  <cit>  the expression of cyp7a <dig>  the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, in rat liver cells. also apoa-i expression increases in response to dexamethasone in primary rat hepatocytes as reported in numerous studies  <cit> . our results show that insulin inhibits the mrna expression of apoa-i in primary rat hepatocytes. this is in contrast to observations made in previous reports  <cit> . one study, however, shows that insulin at physiological concentrations and an incubation time of  <dig> hours inhibits the secretion of apoa-i from rat hepatocytes  <cit> . apoa-i regulation by insulin may be affected by dose and time since masumoto et al  <cit>  and our results show that  <dig> nm insulin had an inhibitory effect after  <dig> and  <dig> hours, respectively. it appears that increased incubation time  with both physiological and supraphysiological doses  <cit>  switches the effect to be positive suggesting that insulin may have both fast and long term effects on target genes.

in summary, the present results suggest that dexamethasone and insulin have opposite roles in the regulation of genes participating in the reverse cholesterol pathway. it has been demonstrated that dexamethasone increases the internalization of hdl particles in rat hepatocytes  <cit>  which may result from the increased hepatic expression of sr-bi observed here. furthermore, the conversion of the accumulated cholesterol to bile acids is stimulated by the increased expression and activity of cyp7a <dig>  <cit> . this alone would be expected to result in reduced plasma hdl levels, but since the synthesis of apoa-i  <cit>  and the mrna expression of abca <dig> and abcg <dig> is increased at the same time, it is not unreasonable to assume that the levels of plasma hdl actually increases. thus dexamethasone-treatment, at least in short-time studies , may increase reverse cholesterol transport to get rid of the excess cholesterol and thus result in a healthier lipid profile with increased levels of plasma hdl.

CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrates that the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone increases the mrna levels while insulin reduces the mrna expression of sr-bi, abca <dig>  and abcg <dig> in primary rat hepatocytes. in the two human cell lines hepg <dig> and thp- <dig>  however, the effect of dexamethasone was absent or inhibitory, illustrating an important difference in the use of cell lines vs. primary cells in the study of glucocorticoids. we suggest that this difference is a result of the endogenous expression levels of gr as illustrated by western blotting and the use of the anti-glucocorticoid mifepristone.
