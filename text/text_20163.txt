BACKGROUND
olfaction serves to detect environmental chemical information. nocturnal insects such as moths appear as ideal models to study the physiology of olfaction, since this sensory modality is essential for their survival and thus highly developed. in particular, the moth pheromone detection system is extremely sensitive: a male can smell and locate a female miles away for mating  <cit> . it has been for long an established model to study the molecular bases of olfaction  <cit> . in addition, moths include diverse and important pests of crops, forests and stored products. olfaction underlies several behaviours critical for crop aggression, including sex pheromone-mediated reproduction, host selection and oviposition  <cit> . it is thus an attractive target for pest control. for example, several olfactory-based strategies have been developed to control moth populations, such as mass trapping and mating disruption  <cit> . better knowledge on the molecular mechanisms by which an odour generates a neuronal signal could lead to the identification of targets for the development of new safe control strategies.

the olfactory signals are detected by the antennae, the peripheral olfactory organs, where they are transformed in an electrical signal that will be further integrated in the central nervous system. located on the head, the antennae carry thousands of innervated olfactory structures, the sensilla, which house the olfactory receptor neurons. within these sensilla, odour recognition relies on the expression of a diversity of olfactory genes involved in different steps . first, volatile odours are bound by odorant-binding proteins  in order to cross the aqueous sensillum lymph that embeds the olfactory neuron dendrites. the obp family notably includes two sub-families: the pheromone-binding proteins , thought to transport pheromone molecules, and the general odorant-binding proteins , thought to transport general odorants such as plant volatiles  <cit> . many other soluble secreted proteins are also found in abundance within the sensillum lymph, examples are the so-called chemosensory proteins , the antennal binding proteins x  and the sensory appendage proteins   <cit> , but their role in olfaction remains elusive. after crossing the lymph, odorant molecules interact with olfactory receptors  located in the dendritic membrane of receptor neurons . the chemical signal is then transformed into an electric signal that will be transmitted to the brain. sensory neuron membrane proteins , located in the dendritic membrane of pheromone sensitive neurons  <cit> , are thought to trigger ligand delivery to the receptor  <cit> . signal termination may then be ensured by specific enzymes, the odorant-degrading enzymes  . although we still lack a consensus on the exact function of each protein family, the occurrence of a large diversity within these families suggests they participate in the specificity of odour recognition  <cit> . the combinatorial expression of these proteins within a sensillum may ensure the specificity and the sensitivity of the olfactory reception, defining the functional phenotypes of olfactory receptor neurons.

complete or partial repertoires of putative olfactory genes have been established in insect species with an available sequenced genome. in other species for which no genomic data are yet available, such as crop pest moths, we still lack a global view of the olfactory genes. homology-based cloning strategies led to the identification of conserved genes, such as obps  <cit> , but failed to reliably identify divergent genes, in particular ors. insect ors constitute an atypical family of seven transmembrane domain receptors exhibiting a pronounced intra - as well as inter-specific sequence diversity. as a result, or repertoires have been established using the complete or partial genome databases of, among examples, the dipterans drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and anopheles gambiae  <cit> , the hymenopterans apis mellifera  <cit>  and nasonia vitripennis  <cit> , the coleopteran tribolium castaneum  <cit>  and the lepidopteran b. mori  <cit> . in other lepidoptera, only few ors and prs have been identified to date  <cit> . among them, one atypical subtype of ors, defining the so-called d. melanogaster or83b orthologue family, is required for the functionality of the other ors  <cit> . this subtype is highly conserved among insects and orthologues have been identified in numerous species, including a variety of moths  <cit> . the identification of additional moth ors and prs is thus challenging. this will provide information on the evolution and diversification of this receptor family in this biodiverse group of insects and, in a context of plant protection, ors appear as good targets for the design of molecules capable to interfere with the ligand and thus the receptor response and the associated insect behaviour.

expressed sequence tag  sequencing strategies are efficient in identifying a large number of genes expressed in a particular tissue, thus providing information on the physiological properties of this specific tissue. such approaches are particularly relevant when no genomic data are available for the target species. est collections are now established for various tissues in several lepidoptera species, especially in b. mori, the only lepidoptera for which the genome has been sequenced  <cit> . however, only two est strategies have been previously engaged on antennae. in  <dig>  robertson et al  <cit>  sequenced  <dig> ests from manduca sexta antennae and identified a variety of candidate obps, but no ors. in  <dig>  jordan et al  <cit>  sequenced  <dig> ests from the antennae of the tortricid, epiphyas postvittana, whose analysis revealed members of families implicated in odorant and pheromone binding  and turnover . only three genes encoding putative ors were found, including one encoding an orthologue of the non-canonical odorant receptor or83b from drosophila.

in view of these difficulties in identifying ors, we combined high-throughput sequencing and normalization of a cdna library, prepared from the antennae of the cotton leafworm spodoptera littoralis. this polyphagous noctuid species is one of the major pests of cotton, and much is known about its olfaction, thanks to previous behavioural and electrophysiological investigations: the sex pheromone, plant volatiles activating olfactory neurons, and various functional types of olfactory sensilla have been characterized  <cit> . s. littoralis thus appears particularly well-suited to establish the molecular bases of olfactory and pheromone reception in a crop pest from the noctuid family, which groups some of the most aggressive herbivorous pests.

in this paper, we report the analysis and annotation of  <dig> ests obtained from s. littoralis male antennae. first, this allowed us to establish the use of transcriptome sequencing to identify putative olfactory genes, and among them chemosensory receptor-encoding genes. we report on the identification of  <dig> candidate olfactory/gustatory receptor genes in a species for which no genomic data are available. second, we provide evidence that the antennae express different non olfactory genes possibly involved in processes such as defense, plasticity and circadian rhythms. these est resources will be invaluable for exploring the mechanism of olfaction and pheromone detection, but also other antennal processes, in a pest model species.

RESULTS
est statistics and unigene prediction
a total of  <dig> ests  were obtained from male antennae of s. littoralis. a first batch of  <dig> sequences, obtained by genome-express , has been deposited in the genbank database . a second batch of  <dig> ests, sequenced by the genoscope , has been deposited in the european molecular biology laboratory   and genbank . full description of all ests is available in additional file  <dig>  the ests were processed and assembled.  <dig> ests  were assembled into  <dig> contigs,  <dig> sequences corresponded to singletons and  <dig> were removed due to vector contamination. the contigs have been submitted to insdc into the tsa division . all together, singletons and contigs were merged into a set of  <dig> unigenes that putatively represent different transcripts . full description of the unigenes is available in additional file  <dig>  on average, each contig was assembled from  <dig>  ests.  <dig>  of the unigenes were singletons,  <dig>  of contig sequences had two ests,  <dig>  had three ests, and  <dig>  had more than  <dig> ests. it has to be pointed out that we did only 5' end sequencing that, together with splice variants, polymorphism or reverse transcriptase errors, may have led to under-assembly and thus over-estimation of unigene counts. examples of such under-assembly, revealed by manual obp and or analyses, are discussed later.

* unigenes with a significant match against nr, drosophila melanogaster proteome or bombyx mori transcripts.

identification of putative orfs
among the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig> presented a coding region . protein sequences translated from the predicted open reading frame  set were compared to the non-redundant protein database  and to the d. melanogaster and b. mori complete proteomes  . most of the sequences  translated from predicted orfs, showed similarity to known proteins.  <dig> orfs presented no similarity at all. the  <dig> protein sequences having no similarity with the b. mori proteome were further compared to the b. mori genome using tblastx , since the b. mori protein prediction available in silkdb may have missed some genes.  <dig> remaining s. littoralis protein sequences had no similarity with any b. mori gene.  <dig> were classified in a gene ontology term and were analyzed using blast2go . interestingly, we found enrichment in putative proteins involved in defense response to bacteria , antifungal humoral response , xenobiotic metabolism processes  and interaction between organisms . an enrichment in defense-related objects was recently observed by vogel et al  <cit>  in the transcriptome of the noctuid heliothis virescens pheromone glands, when compared to that of b. mori.

the  <dig> sequences presenting no similarity with any known protein were analyzed using interproscan  <cit>  . interestingly, a sequence of this set presented a pbp/gobp protein domain and appeared as a new original candidate obp, in addition to the others we discovered .

specificity analysis using ests
the unigenes were compared to all published ests from other lepidoptera retrieved from ncbi's dbest  using blastn .  <dig> sequences  gave no similarity to any other ests . the size of these sequences  is significantly shorter  than the size of the  <dig> sequences matching with other lepidopteran ests .  <dig>  of the  <dig> sequences without est match had no predicted orf, which is also significantly higher than the  <dig>  observed in the set of  <dig> sequences with an est match  . the assigned  <dig> orfs, which have no match in other est libraries, correspond to genes that were never isolated from transcriptomic approaches before and likely represent antennal specific transcripts. the  <dig> orfs without est match but with a gene ontology  classification were compared to the  <dig> orfs with at least one est match and a go classification . this comparison should reflect gene enrichment in the antennal transcriptome. interestingly, the set showed enrichment in odorant binding, olfactory receptor activity, sensory perception of smell and g-protein coupled receptor signalling pathway, in correlation with the sensory function of this organ.

gene identification and functional annotation
identification of putative enzymes and secretory proteins
enzymes are supposed to be abundantly expressed in antennae, as part of the signal termination pathway, but may also participate in neuron protection by xenobiotic degradation  <cit> . a total of  <dig> s. littoralis orfs were classified in enzymatic categories using blast2go. in addition to this large analysis, we searched the s. littoralis orf blastp results for enzymes expressed in the antennae, with specific key-words corresponding to putative odes: carboxylesterase , glutathione s-transferase and cytochrome p <dig>  which led to the list of  <dig> unigenes reported in table  <dig>  we found  <dig> orfs presenting significant similarities with cxes. among the insect putative odes, the cxe family is the most studied, and esterase activities were identified in several species that use acetates in their sex pheromone blends  <cit> . in a previous search for cxes expressed in the antennae of s. littoralis  we were able to identify  <dig> putative esterases  <cit> , among which two were specifically expressed in the antennae. further comparison of these two sets of esterases will complete the putative cxe repertoire in s. littoralis antennae. other enzyme families proposed to participate in olfactory signal turnover include glutathione s-transferases and cytochrome p <dig>  which can modify odorants to produce odour-inactive compounds  <cit> . we found  <dig> and  <dig> orfs presenting high similarities with glutathione s-transferases and cytochrome p <dig>  respectively. our analysis confirms that antennae are a hot-spot for enzymatic activities, as suggested by the previous analysis of antennal ests from e. postvitana  <cit> . the role of all these enzymes in olfaction remains to be studied, since these enzymes could also be involved in other processes, such as xenobiotic degradation  <cit> .

the olfactory process within the antennae is thought to be triggered by a large family of proteins, the so-called obps, secreted in the sensillum lymph  <cit> . we thus found it relevant to search for secretory proteins through signalp  <cit>  in all the translated s. littoralis orfs. a total of  <dig> translated orfs  were predicted to contain a signal peptide, among which  <dig>  have matches with known proteins in the nr protein database. among them, candidate binding proteins were found. a complete analysis of candidate obps found in the s. littoralis ests is detailed in the paragraph below. the remaining  <dig> % of the putative s. littoralis secretory proteins did not share significant similarity with known proteins.

identification of putative s. littoralis odorant-binding proteins
 <dig> putative s. littoralis obp  and  <dig> putative csp  fragments were first extracted from the unigenes by scanning the interproscan result for the interpro accession ipr <dig>  tblastn search in nr, and specific tblastn search among the ests with the b. mori obp  <cit>  and csp  <cit>   complete repertoires as queries. after a detailed analysis of sequence alignments, several contigs and/or singletons that were not automatically assembled were considered to encode a same putative protein . in some cases, pairwise alignments revealed a few nucleotide mismatches, which possibly mirror polymorphism or enzyme errors in the cdna synthesis process . in other cases, alignments revealed the presence of large inserts within nucleotide sequences, likely corresponding to unspliced introns. gt splice donor sites were found at the beginning of these inserts and their location appeared to be similar to intron locations described in b. mori obp and csp genes  <cit>  . in total, we annotated  <dig> slitobps  and nine slitcsps  listed in table  <dig>  some slitobp/csp unigenes were incomplete at their 5' ends and the corresponding proteins missed the signal peptide .

interestingly, using interproscan, a new putative obp type was found  that presented no sequence identity with any known insect obps . the deduced encoded protein seemed to be complete  but signalp analyses did not reveal the occurrence of a signal peptide, suggesting that this protein is not secreted or that we missed its n-terminal part. this latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that the amino acid sequence contains only five cysteine residues, one less than usually observed in insect obps. alternatively, this sequence could encode a protein belonging to the takeout or juvenile hormone-binding protein families, since these protein families also bind lipophilic molecules. however, alignment with lepidoptera takeout or juvenile hormone-binding proteins was not possible. further molecular  and functional  analyses are now needed to definitely annotate this new protein as an obp.

although the best blastx hit for two unigenes, the contig ez <dig> and the singleton fq <dig>  consisted of putative bmorobps, they could not be aligned with insect obps and both presented similarity with juvenile hormone-binding protein and takeout-like proteins. thus, they were not included in the following phylogenetic analyses.

a phylogenetic analysis of obps  was carried out using protein sequences from s. littoralis, b. mori and other lepidoptera . in view of these analyses, at least one lepidopteran orthologue could be found for each putative slitobp identified, except for the new type of obp identified in this study . in particular, we were able to annotate three slitpbps  and two slitgobps . since we found one candidate in each of the three lepidopteran pbp lineages and in each of the two gobp lineages, it suggests that we identified the complete repertoire of these obp families in s. littoralis. interestingly, the blastx best hit for ez <dig> was s. frugiperda pbp <dig>  but the phylogenetic position of the protein translated from this contig strongly argues that it does not belong to the pbp family.

identification of s. littoralis candidate chemosensory receptors
 <dig> candidate chemosensory receptors were identified in male antennae
the chemosensory receptor family includes ors and gustatory receptors . in b. mori, the recently available sequenced genome offered the opportunity to identify the almost complete repertoires of ors  <cit>  and grs  <cit>  in a lepidopteran species.  <dig> candidate b. mori ors  previously identified  <cit>  were compared to the unigenes using tblastn, leading to a first identification of  <dig> putative ors in s. littoralis . only six bmorors gave no result when used as query sequences . in parallel, the interproscan result was scanned to retrieve sequences including one or more domains related to olfactory reception , resulting in the identification of seven putative ors. among them, three new sequences  were not identified during the precedent analysis using bmorors. additional searches using described insect or families , as well as some isolated lepidopteran sequences  <cit>  and additional bmorors recently identified  <cit>  led to the identification of a total of  <dig> candidate chemosensory receptor partial sequences:  <dig> olfactory receptors  and two gustatory receptors . these s. littoralis sequences were in turn employed in searches to find more genes in an iterative process, which did not lead to the identification of additional candidates.

as for obps and csps, some orfs appeared to overlap with a high sequence identity, and sequence alignments were further manually analyzed. we propose that the following unigenes encode a single protein: ez982777/fq <dig> , ez981960/fq025873/fq <dig>  and fq023155/fq <dig>  the final number of candidate chemosensory receptors identified is then  <dig>  including  <dig> ors and two grs, and the corresponding unigenes are listed in table  <dig> 

putative gustatory receptors expressed in adult antennae
the two gr candidates are, to our knowledge, the first identified in lepidoptera antennae. it is not surprising to find candidate grs since these organs are known to carry some taste sensilla  <cit> . interestingly, one of these grs  presented similarity with members of the gr21a family . in drosophila, gr21a forms a heteromeric receptor in combination with gr63a, which allows the detection of co <dig>  <cit> . putative co <dig> receptors have been described in b. mori  <cit> , one of which  presented 78% identity with the partial sequence we obtained in s. littoralis. since co <dig> receptors are quite conserved among insects  <cit> , this high sequence identity supports the annotation of this s. littoralis gr as a candidate co <dig> receptor. receptor cells to co <dig> were found on the antennae of some insect species, such as the honey bee  <cit>  and drosophila  <cit> , but up to now, moth receptor cells for co <dig> have been only described on labial palps  <cit> . thus, annotation of this gr as a candidate co <dig> receptor awaits further demonstration of co <dig> detection by s. littoralis antennae.

annotation of the s. littoralis putative ors
in s. littoralis,  <dig> glomeruli could be identified in the antennal lobe  <cit> . considering the one receptor-one glomerulus paradigm  <cit> , by which the number of expected ors in a given species should correlates with the number of glomeruli in the antennal lobe, we estimate that the  <dig> candidate or genes identified represent half of the s. littoralis or repertoire. 45% of the slitor amino acid sequences showed low sequence conservation with already known receptor proteins . the remaining slitors presented higher conservation , and eight slitors  shared more than 70% identity with their respective best hits . among these conserved sequences, we could recognize slitor <dig>  and slitor <dig> , two s. littoralis receptors that we previously identified by homology cloning  <cit> . the predicted translations of four unigenes exhibited a high conservation level  with lepidopteran prs previously described  <cit> . since lepidopteran prs form a relatively well conserved lineages  <cit> , these unigenes could encode candidate prs in s. littoralis.

a phylogenetic analysis was conducted with the putative slitors and other lepidopteran or sequences, including the annotated bmorors  . at least one lepidopteran orthologue could be assigned to the majority of the putative slitors, only five of them having no counterpart. without surprise, the highly conserved slitor <dig>  clustered with other or <dig> sequences  . in correlation with the blast results, the four candidate slitprs clustered in the lepidopteran pr clade, supporting their annotation.

qpcr analysis of s. littoralis chemosensory receptors
insect chemosensory receptors usually exhibit a specific or enriched expression in chemosensory organs  <cit> . we thus conducted a preliminary study on a single set of samples and considering a single time point, using quantitative real-time pcr, to address the tissue-distribution of the candidate chemosensory receptors we identified in s. littoralis. data were obtained for  <dig> unigenes . for the others, we encountered primer design problems and/or bad efficiencies. as expected, most of our candidates were expressed in a tissue-specific manner, being enriched in chemosensory tissues , thus supporting our annotation. ez <dig> was expressed in all tissues tested, unexpected for a chemosensory receptor. one of the two gr candidates expressed in the antennae  appeared to be also well expressed in the proboscis, supporting its annotation. interestingly, two candidate ors were well expressed in the proboscis . consistent with this observation, a previous study demonstrated that the taste organ of the mosquito a. gambiae does express ors and exhibited olfactory responses  <cit> .

since pheromone receptors are usually male-specific or male-enriched  <cit> , we next compared slitor expression levels between male and female antennae . although this preliminary analysis is of limited value, we found that four unigenes were enriched in male antennae  . only two of them  corresponded to the slitors annotated as putative prs after the blast and phylogenetic analyses . the two additional putative ors enriched in male antennae  did not present high sequence identities with other moth pr candidates or functionally characterized prs.

other genes putatively involved in the olfactory process and its modulation
ionotropic receptors , sensory neuron membrane proteins  and transduction
recently, the ionotropic receptors , that constitute a family of ionotropic glutamate receptor-related proteins, have been identified as defining a new class of chemosensory receptors in d. melanogaster  <cit> . the  <dig> described d. melanogaster irs were used to search for homologues in the s. littoralis ests by tblastn. this led to the identification of five putative s. littoralis irs. however, further studies are needed to annotate these candidates as irs or classical glutamate receptors, such as obtaining the full length sequences for detailed examination of the binding site.

we also identified two unigenes encoding putative snmps, annotated as snmp <dig> and snmp <dig> in accordance with their best hit . snmps were first identified in pheromone-sensitive neurons of lepidoptera  <cit>  and are thought to play a role in pheromone detection, as demonstrated for the d. melanogaster snmp <dig> homologue  <cit> .

our est analyses  revealed that the antennae appeared to be enriched in genes involved in metabotropic activity. among examples, we annotated unigenes putatively encoding proteins such as g-proteins and g-protein related elements, second messenger-related enzymes and ions channels such as voltage-gated ion channels, calcium and chloride channels . some of these genes have been previously described in detail, such as a diacylglycerol kinase  <cit>  and a transient receptor potential channel  <cit> , whose function in pheromone signal transduction was suspected. however, the way insect ors transduce the signal is currently under debate and although a classical metabotropic pathway via g-protein was assumed  <cit> , recent studies proposed an alternative or complementary ionotropic process  <cit> .

modulation/regulatory process
unigenes were identified as encoding proteins putatively involved in modulation/regulatory process, such as hormone receptors , juvenile hormone-binding proteins, takeout-like proteins and biogenic amine receptors . consistent with the present data, we have previously characterized an octopamine/tyramine receptor expressed in the olfactory sensilla of an other noctuid, mamestra brassicae  <cit> . biogenic amines act as neurohormones, neuromodulators or neurotransmitters in most invertebrate species  <cit> , and evidence has been accumulated over the last decades that such biogenic amines participate in the modulation of olfactory reception  <cit> . ecdysone and juvenile hormone are key hormones involved in the maturation  <cit>  and the plasticity  <cit>  of the olfactory system.

among our unigenes, we have also annotated putative circadian clock components. in addition to the previously described period and cryptochrome genes  <cit> , we identified in s. littoralis antennae other fragments homolog to circadian clock encoding genes, such as timeless and vrille . these data support our previous finding that s. littoralis antennae house a peripheral circadian clock  <cit> .

lepidodb implementation
lepido-db  is a centralized bioinformatic resource for the genomics of major lepidopteran pests  <cit> . this information system was designed to store, organize, display and distribute various genomic data and annotations. beside a blast search and a full text search facilities, the system was constructed using open source software tools from the generic model organism database  including a chado database. all the data, unigenes, orfs and their annotation generated in this project have been included in lepidodb. as a result, from the project page http://www.inra.fr/lepidodb/spodoptera_littoralis one can retrieve the whole sequence set, query with a keyword and retrieve the corresponding sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
the main objective of this study was to identify genes potentially involved in olfactory signal detection in a crop pest model, s. littoralis. we annotated a total of ~ <dig> unigenes encoding putative proteins involved in all the steps of ligand detection . in particular, the normalization process, alongside with the high number of sequenced ests compared to previous antennal libraries, allowed enriching the est collection in rare or low abundant transcripts. this strategy appeared to be particularly relevant for the identification of new insect chemosensory receptors in a species for which no genomic data are available. concerning the pheromone detection process, we identified in this species three pbps, two snmps, candidates prs and many cxes as putative pdes, as a prerequisite to further identify which pbp/pr/snmp/pde act in concert to ensure the specificity of the recognition process within a given functional type of pheromone-sensitive sensilla. their respective expression patterns remain to be elucidated to crack the code of their combinatorial expression.

our analyses also suggest that the olfactory sensitivity may be modulated as early as the antennal level, before signal integration in the brain. indeed, we annotated a long list of biogenic amine/hormone targets and circadian elements expressed in the antennae, as a first step toward understanding olfactory plasticity at the peripheral level.

moreover, our study revealed that antennae express abundant defense-related elements involved in xenobiotic and pathogen protection. this observation could be explained by the fact that antennae, whose morphology is adapted to let odorant molecules enter the organism, represent an open space for harmful molecules.

besides olfaction, insect antennae are involved in different non-olfactory processes, such as taste, balance/gravity, wind and sound sensing  <cit> , and, as recently demonstrated, sun compass orientation  <cit> . the availability of an antennal transcriptome is thus a valuable resource for olfaction and pheromone detection studies, but also for investigation of the molecular bases of other antennal functions.
