BACKGROUND
plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  are a group of rhizosphere-colonizing bacteria that can promote plant growth and control soil-borne diseases, which are of great importance in both basic and applied microbiology  <cit> . bacillus spp. are important members of the pgpr, and have been commercially exploited as biofertilizers and biocontrol agents  <cit> . complete genome sequencing of several plant-associated bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains, including fzb <dig>  cau b <dig>  and yau b9601-y <dig>  have revealed functional genes involved in growth promotion  and disease control  .

detailed investigations of the interactions between plants and root-associated pgpr have been performed to determine the requirements for the bacteria to adapt and colonize roots, providing useful information regarding the potential applications of the pgpr strains in agriculture  <cit> . increasing evidence supports the notion that plant-bacteria interactions mainly occur in the rhizosphere and are regulated by root exudates . for instance, flavonoids secreted by roots of leguminous plants are known to play an important role in the early signaling events of legume-rhizobia interactions  <cit> ; while organic acids, such as malic acid and citric acid, in root exudates recruit bacillus strains in the rhizosphere  <cit> .

high-throughput strategies, including microarray analyses  <cit> , cdna-based suppression-subtractive hybridization  <cit> , and promoter trapping  <cit> , have been applied to investigate bacterial interactions with root exudates  and with the root surface . the groups of genes involved in plant-microbe interactions consist mainly of  genes involved in metabolism, bacterial motility and chemotaxis, transport, secretion, and antibiotics production  <cit> . next-generation sequencing  technologies have provided new opportunities to perform whole-genome sequencing and to investigate dynamic transcriptomes  <cit> . in addition, ngs methods for rna analysis  have been used in studies of small regulatory rnas  <cit>  and genome annotation  <cit> . these technologies have been especially useful in measuring the transcript expression levels under different conditions  <cit> , both for eukaryotes  <cit>  and prokaryotes  <cit> . such high-throughput techniques are time-saving and useful in investigating the uncharacterized genes. compared with conventional strategies, such as microarray analysis, rna-seq offers a better way to study root exudates-bacterium interactions.

b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> was isolated from the plant rhizosphere and is able to reduce attack by the phytopathogenic fungus fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum j. h. owen  through efficient root colonization followed by production of antifungal metabolites . sqr <dig> colonizes roots more efficiently and promotes plant growth better than other root-associated bacillus strains  <cit> . products derived from sqr <dig> are also widely used in agriculture in china under the bio™ trademark. therefore, b. amyloqiquefaciens sqr <dig> could be regarded as an ideal pgpr strain for exploring rhizoshphere plant-microbe interactions.

biofilm formation has been found to be crucial to colonization and expression of beneficial traits by pgpr strains  <cit> . importantly, it was found that the in vitro addition of maize root exudates could stimulate biofilm formation of sqr <dig>  although several studies have explored the plant-microbe interactions through different high-throughput approaches, few investigations have been performed under biofilm-formation condition. in this study, to further explore the mechanisms involved in enhanced biofilm formation of sqr <dig> as regulated by maize root exudates, as well as its regulatory roles on other pgp-relevant functional genes, the complete genome sequence of sqr <dig> was determined by roche  <dig> pyrosequencing to provide a the reference map for transcriptomic analysis. then, the transcriptional profiling was investigated by illumina rna-seq. the results of this study reveal the genetic basis of rhizosphere adaption and plant beneficial effects of sqr <dig>  which are crucial for understanding plant-rhizobacteria interactions and improving the application of this strain in agriculture.

RESULTS
plant-beneficial activities of bacillus amyloliquefaciens sqr9
greenhouse experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> on the growth of maize, one of the most important and widely-planted grain crops in the world. to avoid the confounding influence of mycoprotein on seedlings, equal amounts of inactivated sqr <dig> cells were used as a control. the results revealed that sqr <dig> significantly promoted the growth of maize plants. when live bacterial suspensions were applied, maize biomass, shoot height, root length, and root surface area were significantly greater than the control by 42–60 %, 32–46 %, 33–49 %, and 29–59 %, respectively . this outstanding plant-promoting performance indicates that sqr <dig> can be regarded as an ideal pgpr agent.table  <dig> effect of bacillus amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> on the growth of maize seedlings

interaction of maize and b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9: root colonization and stimulation of biofilm formation by root exudates
understanding of the interaction mechanisms between host plants and pgprs is important for practical application of these agents. root colonization of inoculated pgpr agents is considered as a prerequisite for successful growth promotion and biocontrol activities  <cit> . confocal laser scanning microcopy  indicated that, after  <dig> days of incubation in a gnotobiotic soil system, the green fluorescence protein -tagged sqr <dig> cells colonized the maize root very well and formed biofilms on the roots with a density of approximately  <dig>  × 106 cfu · g- <dig> root .fig.  <dig> colonization of maize roots by sqr9-gfp cells. uninoculated control roots of maize seedlings  and roots inoculated with sqr9-gfp cells  were imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy  at 5-days post-inoculation



root colonization of bacillus strains was indicated to be positively correlated with their ability to form biofilms under laboratory condition  <cit> . since root exudates are important in rhizosphere dialogues and in biofilm formation on plant roots by pgpr strains  <cit> , static culture assays were performed to evaluate the effects of maize root exudates of various concentrations on sqr <dig> biofilm formation. the addition of 1 × and 2 × maize root exudates in 1/ <dig> msgg medium significantly enhanced the biofilm formation of sqr <dig> compared with the control, as revealed by both increased biomass and more complex architecture observed using clsm ; these two treatments did not differ significantly from one another. the  <dig>  × root exudates also stimulated biofilm formation not significantly so .fig.  <dig> effects of concentrated maize root exudates on biofilm formation of sqr <dig>  a effects of maize root exudates on the biomass of biofilm formed by sqr <dig>  data with asterisks were significantly different from the control at each time point . b effects of root exudates on the appearance of biofilm formed by sqr9: a, control, 24 h post-inoculation; b, treatment with maize exudates, 24 h post-inoculation; c, control, 48 h post-inoculation; d, treatment with maize exudates, 48 h post-inoculation). c effects of root exudates on the three-dimensional structure of a biofilm formed by sqr <dig> visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy  24 h post-inoculation. a, c. control; b, d. treatment with maize root exudates



experiments design for investigating the transcriptional profiling of sqr <dig> in response to maize root exudates during biofilm formation
to investigate the regulatory roles of maize root exudates on the rhizosphere behavior of sqr <dig>  especially the mechanisms involved in the induced biofilm formation, a high-throughput illumina rna-seq was performed to study the transcriptomic response of sqr <dig> to maize root exudates. based on the results obtained above, a 1 × concentration of maize root exudates was used in this experiment. considering the dynamics curves of biofilm formation, cells were collected and rna extracted  <dig> and 48 h post-inoculation, which represented the mid-exponential phase  and stationary phase  during the biofilm formation, respectively . thus, two treatments  and two sampling points  for cell harvesting were used in the transcriptomic analysis .

genomic analysis of bacillus amyloliquefaciens sqr9
to provide a mapping background for the transcriptomic analysis, whole-genome sequencing of sqr <dig> was performed using roche  <dig> high-throughput pyrosequencing technology. the general features of the sqr <dig> genome and other relevant bacillus strains are summarized in table  <dig>  the single circular chromosome  with a gc content of  <dig>  % encodes  <dig>  predicted proteins,  <dig> trna genes,  <dig> rrna operons,  <dig> prophages-associated genes, and  <dig> non-coding rnas . the core genomes of sqr <dig> and four other closely related bacillus strains  consists of  <dig>  orthologous genes and a pan genome size of  <dig>  orthologous genes, among which  <dig> genes were unique to sqr <dig> . pairwise genome and gene order comparisons suggested that the majority of the sqr <dig> protein-encoding sequences were conserved in  <dig> and fzb <dig> . an ortholog analysis within the three strains revealed that  <dig> genes were shared by sqr <dig> and fzb <dig>  while only  <dig> genes were shared by sqr <dig> and  <dig> . a phylogenetic tree constructed from the core genomes of sqr <dig> and  <dig> additional bacillus strains indicated that sqr <dig> belonged to the b. amyloliquefaciens group .table  <dig> genomic features of the bacillus amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> genome. the sqr <dig> genome was compared with those of bacillus subtilis  <dig> and three other b. amyloliquefaciens strains

overall transcriptional profiling of sqr <dig> in response to maize root exudates during the biofilm formation process
the rna-seq generated approximately  <dig> million reads for each sample, of which 60–70 % were confirmed to be valid after filtering reads with phred quality scores of <  <dig> using fastx-toolkit version  <dig> . <dig>  . the rarefaction curves revealed that the sequence throughput was sufficient to cover the whole sqr <dig> genome , suggesting that the data were adequate for transcriptomic profiling studies.

based on the standards for identifying genes with significantly different expression levels between different treatments , genes representing roughly  <dig> – <dig>  % of the sqr <dig> transcriptome were significantly regulated by the addition of root exudates as compared with control . of the  <dig> significantly affected genes after the 24-h incubation,  <dig> were annotated with known functions; most belonged to the categories of metabolism and atp-binding cassette  transporters . the remaining  <dig> genes were annotated to encode putative enzymes, hypothetical proteins, and proteins with unknown function. once the biofilm had matured, at 48 h post-treatment, most of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated. of the  <dig>  differentially regulated genes,  <dig> with known functions were mainly assigned to functions related to metabolism, transporters, transcription regulation, cell motility, and chemotaxis . though there were some differences in the fold changes of several significantly regulated genes between real-time pcr and rna-seq, the general trends were consistent between each other, suggesting that the rna-seq data were convincible . these differences were probably caused by use of different methods, which could be also observed in previous studies  <cit> .table  <dig> numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes in the presence and absence of root exudates

genome and transcriptional analyses indicate that maize root exudates enhances sqr <dig> biofilm formation by both growth promotion and extracellular matrix induction
bacterial biofilms are ubiquitous communities of tightly associated cells encased in an extracellular matrix  <cit> . biofilm formation might be affected by both the cell population and extracellular matrix production within the communities. here, whole transcriptomic information revealed the regulatory roles of maize root exudates on biofilm formation of sqr <dig> 

root exudates stimulates the metabolism of sqr <dig> in the exponential phase
after 24 h of incubation in maize root exudate,  <dig> genes relevant to carbohydrates/amino acids metabolism were significantly differentially regulated; of these,  <dig> were activated. in detail, three genes encoding enzymes involved in the embden-meyerhof-parnas  pathway  and the tricarboxylic acid  cycle  were up-regulated . other up-regulated genes related to carbohydrate metabolism included those involved in use of inositol , mannitol , hexulose , and other carbon sources. also genes involved in the metabolism of amino acids, including alanine , glutamate , lysine , and aspartate , were induced by root exudates . in addition, numerous genes annotated as phosphotransferase system  or sugar transporters, as well as cith encoding for citrate transporter, were activated by root exudates . these data, together with the observation that adding maize root exudates significantly enhanced the growth of sqr <dig> cells under aeration , indicate that root exudates can stimulate the metabolism and cell growth of sqr <dig>  thereby leading to a higher cell population.fig.  <dig> schematic of genes involved in metabolism , rhizosphere adaptation, biocontrol, and plant growth promotion in sqr <dig> and their expression patterns in response to root exudates. each significantly differentially expressed gene is marked with a triangle, for which the left and right directions represent 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation, respectively. red indicates up-regulation and blue down-regulation

in contrast, most of the differentially regulated genes involved in metabolism of carbohydrates , including seven in the emp pathway and eight in the tca-cycle, and amino acid/related molecules , were inhibited by root exudates at 48 h post-treatment . as expected, down-regulation of numerous genes related to pts or sugar transporters was observed. in contrast, several genes involved in amino acid/peptide , ferrichrome , mg2+ , and phosphate  uptake were activated .

root exudates induces extracellular matrix production by sqr <dig> in the stationary phase
the genetic regulation pathways of biofilm formation of b. subtilis  have recently been summarized  <cit> . the sqr <dig> genome contains the complete set of relevant genes, including extracellular matrix production genes  and regulatory genes  .

at 24 h post-inoculation, the expressions of the genes related to biofilm formation and involved in extracellular matrix production were not significantly altered, whereas at 48 h post-inoculation the abrb gene, a negative regulator of extracellular matrix production and root colonization  <cit> , was down-regulated by root exudates. as a result, the tapa-sipw-tasa operon responsible for extracellular matrix production was activated in the presence of root exudates . in addition, a small regulatory protein  that stimulates phosphotransfer from degs ~ p to degu  <cit> , was activated. increasing the phosphorylation level of degu enhanced the biofilm formation and root colonization of sqr <dig>  <cit> . in summary, the rna-seq data suggests that maize root exudates stimulates the metabolism and growth of sqr <dig> in the exponential phase, whereas it induces extracellular matrix production in the stationary phrase.

specific components in maize root exudates stimulate biofilm formation of sqr <dig> through different mechanisms
for a better understanding of the chemical composition of and the presence of potential signal compounds in maize root exudates, the exudates was collected as described in the methods and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  as described by badri et al.  <cit> . the results indicated that the maize root exudates was mainly composed of carbohydrates, sugar alcohols, glycosylamines, carboxylic acids, phenolic acids, and amino acids. glucose and xylose were found to be the most prominent carbohydrates. also detected were amino acids , carboxylic acids , glycerol, inositol, ethanolamine, and some other components .

to further understand which maize root exudates components contributed to the sqr <dig> biofilm enhancement, several compounds in concentrations of  <dig> –1 mm were selected for investigation based on the chemical analysis of maize root exudates. these root exudates components included glucose and xylose ; alanine, glycine, leucine, isoleucine, gamma-amino butyric acid, and valine ; and citric acid, malic acid, and fumaric acid  . only glucose at 500 μm and 1 mm significantly promoted sqr <dig> biofilm formation at 24 h post-inoculation, resulting in a biomass increase by 23–32 % relative to the control . no other compounds revealed significant effects, nor did glucose at 48 h post-inoculation . our previous study also suggested that low concentrations  of citric acid and fumaric acid enhanced the biofilm formation of sqr <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effects of specific components in maize root exudates on biofilm formation and growth of sqr <dig>  a effects of different concentrations of glucose on the biomass of biofilm formed by sqr <dig> after incubation for 24 h. b effects of glucose , citric acid  and fumaric acid  on the growth of sqr <dig> under aeration at 8 h post-inoculation. columns with different letters are statistically different according to the duncan’s multiple range tests 



to further investigate the mechanisms by which these compounds enhanced biofilm formation, the influences of glucose, citric acid, and fumaric acid on the growth of sqr <dig> were assessed under aeration. glucose  and citric acid, but not fumaric acid, could significantly stimulate sqr <dig> cell growth .

in addition, the transcriptional levels of epsd and tapa, which are responsible for extracellular matrix production during biofilm formation, in response to glucose, citric acid, and fumaric acid, were determined by real-time pcr. results indicated that fumaric acid induced the expression of both genes after incubation for 24 h, and citric acid stimulated tapa expression at 48 h post inoculation, by more than 2-fold; whereas glucose repressed the expression of tapa at 24 h and did not significantly affect the two operons at 48 h post-inoculation . these findings suggested that glucose enhances the biofilm formation by growth promotion and fumaric acid stimulates biofilm formation by inducing the expressions of epsd and tapa, genes which are involved in matrix production. citric acid seemed to use both mechanisms.table  <dig> effects of glucose, citric acid, and fumaric acid on the expressions of matrix production relevant genes  of sqr <dig> under biofilm formation conditions

whole transcriptomic analyses reveals the rhizosphere adaptation and plant-beneficial effects of sqr9
genes involved in degradation of plant polysaccharides
cellulose and hemicellulose are major components of root debris and are widespread in the rhizosphere  <cit> . several genes involved in cellulose degradation  as well as genes related to xylan transport and utilization , were all identified in the sqr <dig> genome. they are likely to improve the ability of sqr <dig> to exploit various plant-derived polysaccharides in the rhizosphere . interestingly, bgls and bgla were significantly induced by root exudates at 24 h post-inoculation. the same was the case for xyna at 48 h post-inoculation .

genes involved in cell motility and chemotaxis
bacteria in the rhizosphere sense signals released from roots  <cit>  and swim to the root surface for attachment, which is a prerequisite for biofilm formation and root colonization  <cit> . in the sqr <dig> genome, a variety of genes governing flagellar synthesis, chemotaxis and cell motility , were identified and found to be highly conserved across bacillus strains   <cit> .

at 24 h post-inoculation, several genes involved in chemotaxis  and flagella synthesis  were found to be up-regulated in response to root exudates , suggesting that the presence of specific compounds in maize root exudates can attract sqr <dig> cells. at 48 h post-inoculation,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in the fla-che cluster and several other cell motility/chemotaxis genes were all down-regulated in response to the root exudates .

nrps  and pks  gene clusters for suppressing soil-borne pathogens in the rhizosphere
a considerable proportion of the genomes of b. amyloliquefaciens strains are dedicated to the nonribosomal synthesis of lipopeptides and polyketides, which play important roles in suppressing of different soil-borne pathogens  <cit> . sqr <dig> possesses eight gene clusters that are also present in the model pgpr b. amyloliquefaciens strain fzb <dig>  <cit>  and that are responsible for the synthesis of surfactin, bacillomycin d, fengycin, bacillibactin , bacilysin, macrolactin, difficidin, and bacillaene, respectively . the presence of all of the antibiotic products of these clusters in sqr <dig> has been confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry , and can be directly linked to the biological control activity of sqr <dig>  our previous results showed that bacillomycin d is the major antibiotic against the soil-borne wilt fungal pathogen f. oxysporum  <cit> .

the unique genomic island gi <dig>  is composed of  <dig> open reading frames  . blastp indicated that this cluster includes the genes encoding polyketide synthase modules and related proteins, as well as abc transporters and histidine kinase, which might have been obtained from ornithinibacillus scapharcae by horizontal gene transfer . an sqr <dig> mutant with a deletion of the whole gi <dig> lost its antagonistic ability against the phylogenetically closely related strain b. amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig>  but not against b. subtilis  <dig>  implying that this cluster might be involved in the biosynthesis of a novel polyketide antibiotic that inhibits closely-related bacillus strains . in summary, sqr <dig> uses approximately  <dig>  % of its genome to encode a variety of antibiotics.

at 24 h post-inoculation, up-regulation of the surfactin genes srfaa and srfab in response to the root exudates was observed. the dhb cluster responsible for synthesis of bacillibactin, which is a type of siderophore that operates under iron-limited conditions  <cit> , was found to be down-regulated in the presence of root exudates. interestingly, several genes involved in the pks <dig> clusters were also down-regulated by root exudates . at 48 h post-inoculation, dhbc, dhbe were up-regulated, as well as baca, which is involved in the biosynthesis of bacilysin, a dipeptide with antibacterial activity  <cit> . the fen cluster, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of fengycin, a lipodecapeptide antibiotic with an internal lactone ring and a β-hydroxy fatty acid chain that is mainly active against fungi  <cit> , was down-regulated by the presence of the root exudates .

genes involved in plant growth promotion
several genes reported to be involved in tryptophan-dependent indole-3-acetic acid  synthesis in b. amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig>  including ysne, yhcx, and dhas  <cit> , as well as the alsrsd operon which is responsible for  <dig>  3-butanediol biosynthesis, were found to be present the sqr <dig> genome . in the transcriptomic analysis, both alss and alsd were activated at 24 h post-inoculation, which could be attributed to presence of the precursor  for iaa synthesis in the maize root exudates .

the phy gene, which encodes the phytase precursor, was also detected in the sqr <dig> genome . phytase degrades phytate into lower phosphate esters of myo-inositol and phosphate, thus promoting plant growth under phosphate-limited condition  <cit> .

discussion
previous high-throughput studies of plant-microbe interactions under aerobic conditions in vivo or in the rhizosphere  <cit>  have indicated that biofilm formation is closely related to root colonization and is necessary for beneficial effects  <cit> . although b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> is a pgpr derived from the cucumber rhizosphere, it appears to have outstanding growth promotion and enhanced root colonization abilities on maize roots . considering that sqr9-derived agents are widely applied in maize production, and biofilm formation of sqr <dig> was significantly stimulated by maize root exudates , an illumina rna-seq was performed for the whole transcriptional investigation.

phylogenetic analysis of the b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> genome
whole-genome sequencing of sqr <dig> indicated that its core genome is very similar to the core genomes of other b. amyloliquefaciens strains, such as fzb <dig> and cau b <dig>  <cit> . based on gene phylogenies, including for gyra  and chea , and on plant-associated characteristics, such as root colonization, nonribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites, and the occurrence of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, b. amyloliquefaciens strains can be divided into two subspecies clades, the amyloliquefaciens and plantarum groups  <cit> . these groups might have evolved in different environments long ago, since the patterns of molecular clock mutation and gain/loss of functional genes were quite consistent. phylogenies of gyra and chea indicated that sqr <dig> belongs to the plantarum group, which consists of several plant-associated b. amyloliquefaciens strains, including fzb <dig>  cau b <dig>  and yau b9601-y <dig> . several other distinguishing characteristics of these two subgroups mentioned above all supports the notion that sqr <dig> is more closely related to the plant-associated b. amyloliquefaciens strains, which are clearly distinct from the non-plant-associated strains, such as dsm7t, s <dig>  and atcc <dig>  <cit> . further investigation revealed that the functional elements contributing to the potential of sqr <dig> as a plant-associated beneficial bacterium were mainly due to genes involved in rhizosphere adaptation, biocontrol, and plant growth promotion.

mechanisms involved in stimulating biofilm formation by maize root exudates as revealed by rna-seq
activation of the metabolism-related genes in sqr <dig> by root exudates at 24 h post-inoculation is consistent with previous findings that monosaccharides, amino acids, and organic acids are major components of plant root exudates and serve as growth substrates for rhizosphere microbes  <cit> . another significant group at this time-point includes genes involved in cell motility and chemotaxis, suggesting that some specific components of maize root exudates can be recognized by sqr <dig> to establish rhizosphere cross talking  <cit> . this observation is consistent with other reports showing that expression of motility-related genes is required for progression of pellicle formation  <cit> . because the expressions of genes related to biofilm formation did not differ significantly from the control, the biofilm induced by root exudates at 24 h post-inoculation could be attributed to the activation of genes involved in metabolism  and cell motility/chemotaxis. this assumption is supported by the finding that additional glucose and citric acid promoted both biofilm formation and growth of sqr <dig> , which is also in accordance with reports in which it is reported that glucose and other carbon source can influence biofilm development in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . however, glucose suppressed the expressions of epsd and tapa, genes responsible for the matrix production at 24 h post-inoculation, which could counteract the induction of these two operons by fumaric acid .

the stimulation of biofilm formation by root exudates at 48 h post-inoculation may be mainly attributed to the suppression of abrb, a negative regulator of biofilm formation, which activates the tapa-sipw-tasa operon encoding the tasa extracellular matrix protein  <cit> . additional real-time pcr results also suggest that the citric acid and fumaric acid in maize root exudates enhances the expression of the tapa operon. other probable reasons for this notion are:  repression of genes involved in cell motility and chemotaxis at 48 h, which could help to maintain the mature aggregation phase  <cit> ;  down-regulation of genes related to the metabolism of carbohydrates and/or amino acids at 48-h represses microbial metabolism, which has been found to be depressed in mature biofilms relative to that of proliferating biofilms  <cit> ; and  activation of a series of genes involved in iron transport, including dhbe/c  and ycln/o . iron has been reported to play important roles in bacterial biofilm formation, although its detailed function in the pellicle formation of b. subtilis strains has not been well explored to date . the observation that deletion of iron transporter genes  in sqr <dig> disabled its ability to form biofilms , further confirms the importance of iron in sqr <dig> biofilm formation.

in summary, maize root exudates mediates the biofilm formation of sqr <dig> by both promoting cell growth and inducing matrix production. components, including glucose and citric acid, that are directly involved in the emp pathway and the tca cycle stimulate cell growth during the early biofilm formation stage, whereas in the stationary stage, citric acid and other unidentified compounds activate the matrix production genes.

although the transcriptomic data generally explain the stimulatory effects of root exudates on biofilm formation of sqr <dig>  the detailed pathways between the signal molecules in the exudates and the target genes  remain unclear. l-malic acid in tomato root exudates could be sensed by the extracellular calcium channels and chemotaxis receptors domain in the kind of b. subtilis  <dig> and could consequently stimulate the phosphorylation of spo0a and pellicle formation  <cit> . another recent study indicated that certain plant polysaccharides can trigger b. subtilis biofilm formation by serving as both a signal of the kinases controlling the phosphorylation state of the master regulator spo0a as well as a source of sugars for the synthesis of the matrix exopolysaccharide  <cit> . these studies provide perfect models for investigating the molecular interactions between environmental signals and bacterial biofilm formation in the rhizosphere.

nrps/pks clusters identified in the sqr <dig> genome
the eight confirmed nrps/pks clusters in the sqr <dig> genome together with another candidate encode powerful weapons to suppress various plant pathogens  <cit> . in addition to their antibiotic activities, these secondary metabolites were also found to have other roles in rhizosphere adaptation and indirect pathogen suppression. as a versatile lipopeptide, surfactin could affect motility by reducing surface tension  <cit> , stimulating biofilm formation by inducing potassium leakage and the subsequent activation of downstream genes  <cit> , and serving as a signal to induce plant resistance  <cit> . bacillomycin d produced by sqr <dig> is involved in the early stages of biofilm formation  <cit> .

noticeably, gi <dig> encodes a potential polyketide antibiotic that inhibits closely-related bacillus strains. domain analysis and prediction of the  <dig> orfs performed by antibiotics & secondary metabolite analysis shell  suggested that  <dig> modules with pks-related domains may be involved in synthesizing a polyketide antibiotic with a 33-membered ring lactone skeleton. however, the elucidation of the molecular structure and the detailed synthesis pathway of this antibiotic will require further exploration.

modeling of the rhizosphere interaction of sqr <dig> with plants and pathogens
whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic data of sqr <dig> identified several elements relevant to its potential as a plant-associated pgpr strain. bacteria in the rhizosphere sense root exudates components released by plants  <cit>  through methyl-accepting proteins, activate their motility related genes , and then swim to the root surface for attachment. at the same time, the genes involved in metabolism  and transport  of various substrates are also induced. activation of several nrps/pks genes related to antibiotic production  also takes place to outcompete other microbes in the struggle for access to the root surface and to form biofilms. thereafter, regulation of genes related to biofilm formation in cells attached to the root surface stimulates bacterial aggregation, thus allowing effective colonization and establishing a rhizospheric competition with soil pathogens. finally, stimulation of the nrps/pks and plant growth-promotion  genes contributes to pathogen biocontrol and growth stimulation, respectively . thus, root exudates can activate the rhizosphere adaptation and survival elements of sqr <dig>  which in turn exerts beneficial biocontrol and growth-promotion effects, resulting in a mutually-beneficial relationship between plant and pgpr strain.fig.  <dig> proposed model of rhizospheric interactions of the pgpr strain, plant, and pathogens. the model is based on the results of the transcriptional profiling in this study



CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptional profiling of b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> responding to maize root exudates, and its complete genome sequence, obtained by illumina sequencing and roche  <dig> pyrosequencing, respectively, suggest that the biofilm formation-stimulation effects are mainly attributed to growth promotion and extracellular matrix induction. future disruptions of potential rhizosphere-associated genes identified by transcriptional profiling will be performed to better understand their roles in plant-microbe interactions. in addition, an in vivo test will be performed in further work, and the strategy for collection of root-attached bacteria and for the elimination of plant associated cdna reads will be carefully considered prior to any additional research.
