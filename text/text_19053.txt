BACKGROUND
non-host resistance  is resistance exhibited by an entire plant species to all genetic variants of a non-adapted pathogen species  and represents the most robust and durable form of plant resistance in nature  <cit> . the presence of this defense system explains why plants are immune to the vast majority of potential pathogens and normally healthy. molecular mechanisms underpinning nhr remain relatively unexplored compared with the well-studied host resistance mediated by the products of plant resistance  genes, which establish pathogen race- or plant cultivar-specific resistance  <cit> .

nhr against bacteria, fungi and oomycetes can be divided into two types  <cit> . type i nhr does not produce visible symptoms whereas type ii nhr results in a rapid hypersensitive response with cell death  <cit> . type i nhr is much more common than type ii nhr, and nhr of plants against the majority of unadapted pathogens belongs to type i. plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to exclude unadapted pathogens. an obvious initial requirement for plant disease is basic compatibility where appropriate physical and chemical signals from the plant are required for inducing cell differentiation and expressing essential pathogenicity genes  <cit> . presence of preformed plant physical and chemical barriers, including plant cell wall and plant surface antimicrobial enzymes and secondary metabolites, are often considered the first line of defense in plants against a pathogen before penetration  <cit> . constitutive barriers are more likely to contribute to nhr to pathogens of other plant families than to pathogens of related plant species  <cit> . after these constitutive barriers are breached, plants have evolved inducible defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. an example of an inducible structural barrier is the formation of papillae. this local cell wall fortification is formed on the inner side of plant cell walls at the penetration site. all microbes possess a suite of conserved molecules, called mamps/pamps  that can be recognized by plants, often via receptor kinase located in the plant plasma membrane  <cit> . the plant primary innate immune responses are mediated by transmembrane pattern pamp-triggered immunity  that can halt further colonization of the pathogen  <cit> . however, effector triggered immunity  is not just confined to adapted pathogen recognition and may also play a role in nhr, particularly against pathogens that colonize plant species closely related to non-host species  <cit> .

obligate biotrophic pathogens, with a specific lifestyle that keeps plant cells alive and minimizes tissue damage in susceptible hosts, are suitable for nhr studies  <cit> . arabidopsis nhr to non-adapted biotrophic powdery mildews is based upon two successive, multicomponent and independently effective defense systems: pen gene-mediated pre-invasion resistance and eds1/pad4/sag101-controlled post-invasion immunity  <cit> . compared to powdery mildew fungi, the understanding of nhr mechanisms to rust fungi has lagged behind. puccinia and uromyces represent two large and important genera of rust fungi, which have damaged cereals and legumes, respectively, around the globe throughout history  <cit> . the emergence of ug <dig>  a new pathotype of the wheat stem rust pathogen that threatens global wheat production, is a reminder of the need for durable rust resistance in cereals  <cit> . much effort has been taken to study nhr to rust with non-host pathosystems of puccinia-gramineae and uromyces-dicotyledons at histological and cytological levels, demonstrating that the majority of rust pathogens are arrested immediately after the formation of the first haustorium mother cell  in most non-host plant species  <cit> . several recent studies have investigated the interaction of rust pathogens on non-host plants mainly at molecular levels, including growth of u. vignae, p. triticina, hemileia vastatrix on arabidopsis <cit> , p. hordei and u. fabae on wheat  <cit> , p. triticina, p. hordei-murini, p. hordei-secalini and p. persistens on barley  <cit> , and p. graminis, p. triticina, p. striiformis, p. hordei and melampsora lini on rice  <cit> . these studies demonstrated that nhr to rust fungi is polygenically inherited and is an active response involving salicylic acid  signaling.

broad bean  is one of the oldest crops cultivated by humans and an important temperate legume crop used as a source of protein in human diets, as fodder and as forage crop for animals, and for available nitrogen in the biosphere  <cit> . however, broad bean can be seriously damaged by the broad bean rust, caused by u. viciae-fabae. due to the enormous size  and complexity of the broad bean genome  <cit> , research into the functional genomics and cloning of interesting genes has been hampered.

to date, little is known about the nature of effective defense mechanisms in legumes to pathogens of remotely related plant species, especially wheat rust pathogens with economic and biological importance. in this study, nhr in broad bean to the wheat stripe rust pathogen, p. striiformis f. sp. tritici , was systematically investigated at the histological and molecular levels. the results indicate that nhr in broad bean to pst results from a continuum of layered defenses and provide useful information for further determination of resistance mechanisms of broad bean to rust fungi.

RESULTS
type i nhr to pst on broad bean
to determine if different broad bean genotypes show different infection responses to genetically distinct pst races, two broad bean cultivars, yuxidabaidou and linxiadacaidou, were inoculated with three chinese pst races cyr <dig>  cyr <dig> and cyr <dig>  respectively. no visible symptoms were observed 14 days post-inoculation on broad bean leaves , and similar macroscopic responses were obtained from these different combinations. thus broad bean displayed type i nhr against pst infection. additionally, microscopic observations show that no significant differences in fungal growth among these two broad bean cultivars in regard to their interactions with the different pst races .

 one broad bean cultivar grown in gansu, china.

the linear length of infection hyphae  were measured by microscopy at nine days post-inoculation. data are mean ± standard deviation, and there is no statistical difference  compared by student t tests.

in regard to economic importance, the pathosystem between yuxidabaidou that is one main broad bean cultivar grown in yunnan, china, and cyr <dig>  one of two predominant pst races in china, can be taken as a representative of the broad bean-pst non-host interaction and was therefore used for further experiments in the study.

growth and development of pst on broad bean
approximately, 88% of pst urediniospores germinated to produce germ tubes that grew randomly on leaves of the non-host broad bean . in a similar fashion, 91% of urediniospores produced germ tubes on wheat . however, only  <dig> % of germ tubes successfully located a broad bean stomate compared to 25% on wheat . of those germ tubes successfully locating a stomate on broad bean, 96% subsequently penetrated it and formed an infection hypha  compared with 98% on wheat . however, of the infection units on broad bean, 28% contained an aberrant substomatal vesicle  with an irregular oval shape, which did not coincide with stomata , 22% did not have a ssv structure , and only 50% contained a normal ssv that formed within the substomatal chamber, which was adjacent to stomata and had a normal oval shape typical of pst on wheat . a haustorial mother cell  was formed at the tip of the infection hypha in close contact with mesophyll cells . however, only 2% of infection hyphae formed haustoria within penetrated mesophyll cells . in contrast, 88% of pst infection hyphae produced a haustorium on wheat . therefore, successful location of stomata and development of haustoria were greatly reduced in pst infection of broad bean.

the linear length of infection hyphae, and numbers of hyphal branching, haustorial mother cells and haustoria per infection unit at a serial time points post-inoculation were also measured, and they were maintained at approximately 55 μm,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, from  <dig> hours post-inoculation  . only one or two primary hyphae were produced and the vast majority of the pst infection hyphae were blocked at haustorium mother cell formation in broad bean leaves compared with extensive colonization and formation of secondary hyphae in wheat leaves at  <dig> hpi . thus pst development was completely arrested from  <dig> hpi.

histochemical evaluation of broad bean nhr response to pst
an active nhr response was shown to be involved in the suppression of pst growth on broad bean. a dome-shaped papilla was formed on the inner side of broad bean cell walls at the penetration site adjacent to the hmc . thickened cell walls were also present in broad bean mesophyll cells in contact with hmc . the production of h2o <dig> and o2- in broad bean against pst was analyzed by staining with  <dig> ′-diaminobenzidine  and nitroblue tetrazolium , respectively. accumulation of h2o <dig> was detected at the sites in direct contact with ssv or hmc, and in papilla . in infection units with haustorium formation, dab staining was detected at deposits responsible for haustorium encasement . dab staining was occasionally observed in the hmc . the percentage of infection units with dab staining increased rapidly from  <dig> to  <dig> hpi and then gradually declined . nbt staining was not detected in plant cells of any sample .

aniline blue staining indicated that callose deposition was associated with the rust infection units and staining at  <dig> hpi showed the same distribution as h2o <dig> in the plant cell walls at the sites in direct contact with ssv or hmc, in papilla, and at encasement of haustoria . therefore, attempted pst infection of broad bean resulted in rapid production and accumulation of h2o <dig>  and callose deposition, presumably related to the generation of subcellular, localized physical barriers.

the cell walls of mesophyll cells in contact with infection hyphae and neighboring mesophyll cells showed intense bright fluorescence , which is likely related to the accumulation of antimicrobial phenolic compounds. hypersensitive response  with cell death occurred in infection units with haustoria formation as evidenced by plant cell autofluorescence at  <dig> hpi . penetrated mesophyll cells began to collapse from  <dig> hpi .

collectively, attempted infection induced the formation of papillae, cell wall thickening, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition, and accumulation of phenolic compounds in non-host plant cells. the few haustoria that were formed by pst in broad bean cells were encased in reactive oxygen and callose materials and elicited a posthaustorial hypersensitive response.

quantitative real-time pcr  of seven candidate defense-related genes
seven defense-related genes that may be involved in basal resistance, oxidative stress responses and callose formation were selected for qrt-pcr assays. they are putative pathogenesis-related gene  <dig> , pathogenesis-related gene  <dig> , pathogenesis-related gene  <dig> , pathogenesis-related gene  <dig> , superoxide dismutase , catalase , glucan synthase-like  <dig> . these genes on broad bean were identified using homologous sequences deposited in genbank of species closely related to broad bean  for designing a set of primers . these genes  showed 75–97% identities to those used to design primers, and were used for assessments of expression by qrt-pcr, although their full lengths were not available.

a set of primers based on the cloned sequences of the seven defense-related genes were designed , and qrt-pcr was performed to test their expression profiles during pst infection across a series of time points post-inoculation on broad bean. as shown in figure  <dig>  accumulations of vfpr <dig>  vfpr <dig>  vfpr <dig>  and vfpr <dig> transcripts were up-regulated as early as  <dig> hpi, peaked at  <dig> hpi, and declined to original expression levels except for vfpr <dig> that remained at a high level at  <dig> hpi . accumulations of transcripts of vfsod and vfcat, which are involved in oxidative stress peaked at  <dig> hpi, but the induction of vfcat expression was as early as  <dig> hpi . transcription of vfgsl <dig>  a callose formation gene, was up-regulated from  <dig> hpi to  <dig> hpi and then sharply declined . these results indicated that pst infection triggered the induction of a set of defense-related genes in broad bean peaking at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi.

discussion
non-host resistance  with obvious durability has been studied as a source of resistance traits that might help in improving crop performance in the glasshouse and the field  <cit> . in the present study, a continuum of layered defenses led to nhr in broad bean. no visible symptoms were observed on broad bean leaves inoculated with pst, indicating type i nhr. however, a hypersensitive response  with cell death in infection units with haustorium formation was also observed in broad bean leaves by microscopic examination. similar results were observed in the interactions between other rust fungi and non-host plants  <cit> . in nhr analysis of arabidopsis to phytophthora infestans infection, penetrated epidermal cells also displayed a rapid hypersensitive response, although no symptoms could be detected  <cit> . therefore, hr that cannot be detected on visual symptoms, may be observed at the single cell level in type i nhr, which is probably related to low infection probability and an extremely rapid hr on non-host plants.

on non-host broad bean leaves, urediniospores of pst germinated at a similar frequency to those on wheat leaves. however, the germ tubes grew randomly without directional growth on broad bean leaves. there was an approximate twenty fold difference in successful location of stomata on broad bean compared to wheat. it appeared that urediniospores germinated well but had difficulty in locating and recognizing stomata on non-host plants  <cit> . this difference may be due to inappropriate thigmotrophic or biochemical signals arising from the broad bean leaves. this basic incompatibility therefore reduced pst infection efficiency on broad bean by reducing the probability of germ tubes locating stomata . this was somewhat comparable to 85% and 12% reported for p. triticina  on its wheat host compared to a non-host, arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . moreover, in a graminaceous comparison similar inefficiencies by pst, pt, and p. graminis f. sp tritici  in locating stomata in rice compared to wheat were observed . again pst was more inefficient than the other two species. the major difference in the infection process between pst and other rust fungi is that it does not form obvious appressoria, and germ tubes directly penetrate the stomata. this possibly increases the difficulty in locating and recognizing stomata.

among pst infection units, some contained an aberrant substomatal vesicle , and some did not. this difference may be related to different leaf structures between legume and cereal plants, especially the structure and size of the substomatal chambers. the vast majority of pst infection hyphae were blocked at haustorium mother cell formation, which is likely due to plant resistance responses, including papilla formation and cell wall thickening. in other incompatible leguminous-rust or powdery mildew interactions, papilla were frequently observed on plant cell walls  <cit> . it is possible that papilla formation is one of general defense responses effective against biotrophic pathogens in legumes. attempted pst infection also induced the production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition, and the accumulation of phenolic compounds in plant cells. we also observed that the haustoria were encased in reactive oxygen and callose materials and elicited plant cell death. hydrogen peroxide  and callose deposition with the same distribution were detected at  <dig> hpi, coinciding with the fact that the activation of cat, sod and gsl <dig> genes at  <dig> to  <dig> hpi. the balance between sod and apx or cat activities in cells is crucial for determining a steady-state balance of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . u. fabae infection also triggered the induction sod and cat genes in wheat  <cit> . gsl <dig> encodes a glucan synthase involved in papillary callose formation and callose encasement of haustorial complexes in response to the powdery mildew pathogen  <cit> . gsl <dig> gene was also activated in arabidopsis thaliana against the coffee leaf rust fungus hemileia vastatrix <cit> . gsl <dig> may therefore be also involved in papillary callose formation and callose encasement of haustorial complexes in response to the rust fungi. h2o <dig> can facilitate cross-linking of cell walls  <cit> , and callose  deposition may reinforce cell walls at contact sites with fungal structures. phenolic compounds, as one of chemical barrier in inducible defense mechanisms in type i nhr  <cit> , have been reported to have antimicrobial activity  <cit> .

therefore, prehaustorial nhr with basic incompatibility and structural and chemical strengthening of cell walls against the majority of penetrating fungal units, and posthaustorial nhr with a hypersensitive response against the few successful penetrations, collectively contribute to the nhr of broad bean to pst. these features also demonstrate the multi-layered feature of nhr.

pathogen-related proteins encompass several different groups of structurally and functionally unrelated proteins with antimicrobial activities  <cit> . four pr genes observed were up-regulated in response to pst infection in broad bean leaves. the expression of all four pr genes is sa responsive  <cit> . pr <dig> is widely thought to be a molecular marker for the sa-dependent resistance signaling pathway  <cit> . thus, sa-mediated resistance pathway is involved in the non-host broad bean-pst interaction. pr <dig> protein, which has β- <dig> -glucanase activity, can degrade fungal cell walls, together with pr <dig> protein, which has chitinolytic activity, cause the lysis of fungal cell walls  <cit> . we failed to isolate the pr <dig> gene from broad bean. nevertheless, transcription of the pr <dig> gene occurred at a high level from  <dig> to  <dig> hpi, likely playing a role in inhibiting the growth of pst. plasma membrane- permeabilizing ability proper to pr <dig> contributes to plasmolysis and damage of fungal and bacterial pathogens, inhibiting their growth and development  <cit> . pr <dig> involves in plant defense responses and has antimicrobial activity and in vitro ribonuclease activity  <cit> .

in the non-host interaction between broad bean and pst, transcript accumulations of pr genes and the gsl <dig> gene involved in callose formation were up-regulated at 12– <dig> hpi with a peak at  <dig> hpi, whereas transcript accumulations of sod and cat involved in oxidative stress responses were up-regulated as early as 6– <dig> hpi with peaks at  <dig> hpi. the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide  can lead to sa synthesis  <cit> , and elevated levels of sa along with h2o <dig> can activate local pr gene expression  <cit> . h2o <dig> produced during early plant-pathogen interactions also contributes to cell wall strengthening processes, such as the formation of papilla where callose is abundantly deposited  <cit> . thus, h2o <dig> as a singal substance may activate the expression of pr genes and contribute to callose formation in the non-host interaction. this could explain the earlier induction of sod and cat compared to pr genes and gsl <dig> 

although limited by current genomic and transcriptomic data for broad bean, several defense-related genes were successfully identified using the homology cloning approach. we failed to get specific amplification products when using primers designed on the basis of soybean  gene sequences. in contrast, positive amplification was obtained using primers designed from pea  sequences. similar results were obtained with amplification of other genes  <cit> . because of huge genome in broad bean, it was necessary to rely on synteny with related species in order to identify interesting genes  <cit> . this approach allowed us to identify candidate genes responsible for agronomically important traits in broad bean.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we characterized the basis of nhr in broad bean against pst, a pathogen of remotely related plant species, at the histological and molecular levels. our results indicate that the nhr involves a continuum of layered defense processes, including basic incompatibility, structural and chemical strengthening of the cell wall, posthaustorial hypersensitive response and induction of several defense-related genes, demonstrating the multi-levels feature of nhr. nhr of plants to unadapted pathogens exhibits strong similarity and association with basal resistance of plants to adapted pathogens  <cit> . therefore, this study of nhr to pst in broad bean provides useful information for further determination of resistance mechanisms in broad bean to rust fungi, especially the adapted important broad bean rust pathogen, u. viciae-fabae. meanwhile, we confirm that hr can be observed at the single cell level, although there are no visible symptoms in type i nhr.
