BACKGROUND
an essential part of discovery and development of anticancer drugs is to assess the
induced growth inhibition in a biologically broad range of tumour derived cell lines by
dose-response experiments  <cit> . the three large cell line screens nci <dig>  <cit> , jfcr <dig>  <cit> , and cmt <dig>  <cit>  are among the most well-known high throughput cell line drug screens.

the approach used in cmt <dig> and several other studies  <cit>  is currently the standard approach for conducting dose-response experiments.
the experiments are performed by challenging exponentially growing cell lines with a
serial dilution of drug concentrations and estimating growth inhibition by relative cell
counts between the treated and untreated cell line. then, a summary statistic of drug
efficiency gi50r  is obtained by estimating the
concentration at which the relative cell count is 50% after a fixed period of time.
hence, neither drug exposure time nor varying cell line growth rates are considered.

the method is easily comprehended and implemented, however, as illustrated in
figure  <dig> this assessment of growth inhibition leads to
summary statistics that are difficult to interpret. panels a and b illustrate generated
growth curves for two cell line models with doubling times  <dig> and  <dig> hours,
respectively. the cell line models are treated with  <dig> increasing concentrations
c <dig> …,c <dig> of a potent drug for which the effect is assumed
constant through time, resulting in  <dig> growth/decay curves. for concentration c4
cell line model  <dig> is in the decay phase and cell line model  <dig> is in the growth phase
suggesting that cell line model  <dig> is the more sensitive of the two.
counts. panels a and b show growth curves for
two cell line models with doubling times of  <dig> and  <dig> hours, respectively. the
cell line models are treated with  <dig> increasing concentrations
c <dig> …,c <dig> and growth curves for each concentration are
shown. the red line illustrates total growth inhibition .
dose-response curves calculated by relative cell counts for time points  <dig>   <dig> 
and  <dig> hours are shown in panel c.

panel c illustrates dose-response curves calculated at three time points:  <dig>   <dig>  and 73
hours, for the two cell line models. because of the fast growth rate of cell line model
 <dig>  the summary statistic gi50r is obtained at a lower concentration for this cell line
model than for cell line model  <dig> for each of the three time points. this indicates that
cell line model  <dig> is evaluated as the more sensitive of the two. hence, this assessment
of growth inhibition generates summary statistics that are incomparable between cell
lines with different growth rates.

the dose-response experiments performed for the nci <dig> and jfcr <dig> screens are summarised
by comparing net differences between cell counts at observation time and the initial
cell counts for the treated and untreated cell lines. as we illustrate later this method
only partially solves the problem of growth rate dependency.

the concept behind the present work is that modelling the growth of a cell line exposed
to a drug by a simplified differential equation will allow us to derive dose-response
curves and summary statistics that are independent of time under the proposed model. for
estimation of the improved summary statistics a statistical workflow is suggested
consisting of 1) pre-processing of absorbance measurements to account for multiplicative
errors originating from e.g. cell line seeding  <cit>  and correcting for background absorbance caused by the drug  <cit> , 2) isotonic regression for modelling the dose-response curve which is robust
against outliers and model misspecifications  <cit> , and 3) a bootstrap method for estimation of confidence intervals for summary
statistics  <cit> . we also aim to illustrate a transformation of the model used in the cell
line screen nci <dig>  which accounts for each cell line’s doubling time and enables a
reanalysis of existing dose-response data.

finally, the adequacy of the differential equation for modelling real data is tested
using a doxorubicin screen. the screen is also used to investigate the applicability of
the proposed statistical analysis workflow by providing variance estimates for obtained
exposure time independent summary statistics.

methods
the mathematical model
to analyse dose-response experiments rigorously we formulate a model of how the
growth of a cell line is influenced by a given drug. the growth inhibition is
modelled by the compartment models illustrated in figures 2a and b. panel a shows a compartment model for drugs that induce cell
cycle arrest followed by death. for a cell line treated with drug concentration c
≥  <dig> the number of unaffected cells at time t is denoted
n <dig> . the growth of this cell population
is assumed exponential with doubling time t <dig> or equivalently a
growth rate of 1/t <dig>  the concentration dependent rate for cells
going into cell cycle arrest is likewise assumed exponential with halving time
t0c1> <dig>  and n <dig> 
denotes the cell count for this population. finally, the death rate is assumed
exponential and concentration dependent with halving time t1c†> <dig> 
a illustrates a compartment model where the drug is assumed to
induce cell cycle arrest with halving time t0c <dig> and for cells in cell cycle arrest the death rate
is assumed exponential with halving time t1c†. panel b illustrates a simplified
compartment model in which the drug is assumed to induce cell death with
halving time tc†. in both models the cell line grows with doubling
time t <dig>  panel c illustrates growth curves
according to model b for a cell line with t <dig> =  <dig> hours and
n <dig> =  <dig>  cells treated with three different
concentrations of a potent drug. the concentrations correspond to the summary
statistics gi <dig> = c <dig>  tgi
=c <dig>  and lc <dig> =
c <dig> 

we focus on dose-response experiments where the cell count is estimated indirectly by
cell metabolism. however, cells in cell cycle arrest have a very low metabolism and
such cells are indistinguishable from dead cells in these experiments  <cit> . because of this we use the simplified compartment model illustrated in
figure 2b for drugs that induce cell cycle arrest as
well as drugs that lead directly to cell death. in this model n
 denotes the cell count of metabolising cells at time
t for a cell line treated with drug concentration
c ≥  <dig>  the growth rate is assumed to be exponential with
doubling time t <dig>  similarly, the death rates are assumed to be
exponential with halving times tc†> <dig> that decrease concurrently with increasing drug
concentrations c. for drugs that induce cell cycle arrest the halving time
tc†> <dig> is equal to the rate with which cells go into cell
cycle arrest when treated with drug concentration c. compartment model b
gives rise to the following differential equation model 

  dndt=log2t0n-log2tc†n. 

the differential equation has the following solution 

  n=n02t/t0-t/tc†=n02t/tc, 

where the initial condition n <dig> = n , with
c  dropped for short, denotes the cell count at t =  <dig>  

  1tc=1t0-1tc†, 

and tc corresponds to the net observed doubling or
halving time at concentration c.

the posed differential equation model can be summarised by the following statistics 

  gi50:t0tc=12tgi:t0=tc†lct:1tc=-1t, 

where gi <dig>  denotes the concentration at
which the cell line grows with a doubling time twice as long as the same cell line
untreated, tgi  denotes the concentration at
which the cell line has no net growth, and lct
 denotes the concentration at which the
cell count decays with a halving time of t hours. for example
lc <dig> is the concentration at which n 
= n0/ <dig> 

the growth inhibition induced by these drug concentrations is illustrated in
figure 2c for a cell line model with doubling time
t <dig> =  <dig> hours and n <dig> =  <dig> . at the
concentration corresponding to gi <dig> the doubling time for the
cell line is doubled to  <dig>  tgi the halving time
tc†=t0= <dig> such that the growth of the cell line is completely
halted, and lc <dig> the halving time for the cell line is 48
hours.

this leads us to suggest the following growth based dose-response
model denoted by g for evaluating a dose-response experiment 

  g=t0tcifn≥n01tcotherwise. 

it is noteworthy that the g-model is independent of the duration of the
dose-response experiment. the model is summarised by the statistics
gi <dig>  tgi, and lc <dig> at which the
g  equals  <dig> ,  <dig>  and -1/ <dig>  respectively. in
general we define gix and lct
to be the concentrations where g  =
/ <dig> and g  = -1/t.

the cell line screens nci <dig>  <cit>  and jfcr <dig>  <cit>  apply an alternative dose-response model denoted by d, which is
based on net differences between the cell count at time t, n
, and the initial cell count, n <dig> 
the model is defined as 

  d=n-n0n-n0ifn≥n0n-n0n0otherwise=2t/tc-12t/t0-1ifn≥n02t/tc-1otherwise. 

the cell counts which the d-model is based upon are illustrated by the
triangle and circles in figure 2c for t = 48
hours. for this model x% growth inhibition gixd and y% lethal concentration
lcyd are attained at concentrations c1
and c <dig> where d =
/ <dig> and d  =
-/ <dig>  the dose-response model is usually summarised for a fixed
t by gi50d, lc50d, and tgid the latter of
which is attained at the concentration c where d
 =  <dig> 

the large cell line screen cmt <dig>  <cit>  utilises another commonly used dose-response model based on
relative cell counts which is defined as 

  r=n/n0n/n0=nn=21tc-1t0·t=2-t/tc†. 

the cell counts which the r-model is based upon are illustrated by circles
in figure 2c for t =  <dig> hours. for this model
x% growth inhibition gixr is attained at concentration c where r
 = / <dig>  the r-model is
usually summarised by gi25r, gi50r, and gi75r.

for a fixed t, the graph of a dose-response model, say g,
{):c > 0} is denoted the
dose-response curve of g. as the d- and r-models suggest,
the corresponding dose-response curves are dependent on the time t, whereas
the dose-response curve of g is not.

notice it is possible to define a fourth summary statistic aucq
 which is the area above a specified value q
and below the dose-response curve  <cit> . thus, for the dose-response models g and d,
auc <dig> is the area under the dose-response curve for which the
cell count is still increasing with time.

it is possible to circumvent the time dependency of models d and r
by letting the drug exposure time t equal the cell line specific doubling
time t <dig> or a multiple hereof, i.e. t =
kt <dig>  furthermore, the summary statistics for the
g-model are then related with the d-model by 

 gi50=gixd,wherex=212k-12k-1·100tgi=tgidlc48=lcxd,wherex=2-148kt0-1· <dig> 

and for the r-model by 

 gi50=gixr,wherex=2-12k·100tgi=gixr,wherex=2-k·100lc48=gixr,wherex=2-148kt0-k· <dig>  

even if the drug exposure time is not kt <dig> it is still possible to
obtain an estimate of the g-model by the following transformation of the
d-model 

  g=t0tlog22tt0-1d+1ifd≥01tlog2d+1otherwise. 

similarly, an estimate of the g-model can be obtained by the following
transformation of the r-model 

  g=1+t0tlog2riftt0>log2r1t0+1tlog2rotherwise. 

note, however, that both transformations require access to the cell line specific
doubling time t <dig> 

estimation of cell count
absorbance measurements can be utilised as surrogates for the cell count
n and thereby used to estimate the three
dose-response models. this is generally done using an mts assay
-5--2--2h-tetrazolium)
that exploits the mitochondrial reduction of tetrazolium to an aqueous soluble
formazan product by the dehydrogenase enzyme in viable cells at 37°c. the amount
of produced formazan is directly proportional to the cell count n
 and can be quantified colourimetrically by measuring
absorbance at  <dig> nm  <cit> .

the time line for dose-response experiments utilising such assays is outlined in
figure  <dig>  at time t0′ each cell line is seeded into two  <dig> well plates in
which they incubate until time t1′= <dig> where c decreasing concentrations of the
tested drug are added to each plate in l replicates. this time point marks
the start of the dose-response experiment. for plate  <dig> the mts assay is added
immediately after drug exposure i.e. at time t1′ and for plate  <dig> the assay is added at time
t2′ a pre-specified time after the addition of drug.
following the addition of the reagent each plate incubates for a fixed time
tinc after which the absorbance is measured. the
metabolic reduction occurs from the instant the reagent is added until the absorbance
is measured, thus the amount of formazan is related to the cell count during this
time interval. since the number of living cells may differ substantially throughout
this period, the measured absorbance is assumed to estimate the cell count at the
centre of the interval, i.e. at time t1=t1′+tinc/ <dig> and t2=t2′+tinc/ <dig> 
two time points that are used in the statistical analysis.

by seeding cells in an appropriate medium at predetermined concentrations the
relationship between the cell count and the absorbance measure can be assumed linear  <cit> , i.e. 

  αti=γn, 

where γ is a proportionality factor and αti
is the absorbance at time t, for a cell line exposed to drug
concentration ci, i =  <dig> …,i
where  <dig> = c <dig> <c <dig> < ⋯
<ci. the proportionality factor is cell line
specific due to individual capabilities of reducing tetrazolium into the coloured
formazan product.

in order to ensure reproducible results the experiment is repeated k times
for each cell line. the measured absorbance level for the l’th well,
treated with concentration ci, within the
k’th cell line replicate, is assumed equal to 

  yktil=δktαti+βkt+ϵktil,k= <dig> …,k;t=t <dig> t2;i= <dig> ,…,i;l= <dig> …,l, 

where δkt is the inter-plate variation assumed to
be multiplicative, βkt is the plate specific
background absorbance which is assumed to be additive, and, finally, the technical
variation εktil is assumed to be additive and
normally distributed with mean zero and following a heteroscedastic variance model
|δktαti+βkt|2ξσβ <dig> 

statistical analysis workflow
the proposed statistical workflow has been implemented in the statistical software r
version  <dig> . <dig>  the parameter estimation is performed using the function
gnls from the package nlme <cit> . isotonic regression is implemented by the function
isoreg from the library stats, and
the area under the curve is calculated by the function trapz
from the library pracma.


model-based pre-processing

conventionally pre-processing is performed through the following steps: 1) the
background wells containing only medium are used to measure the plate specific
background absorbance, which are averaged and subtracted from the absorbance
measures of all other wells, 2) normalisation is done indirectly through
calculation of growth inhibition by either of the dose-response models d
or r, and 3) summation is done by an average of the obtained values. in
this article, we propose a model-based approach for the pre-processing. the
pre-processing of the dose-response experiments consists of outlier detection,
background correction, normalisation, and summation. these steps are done
simultaneously by estimating the coefficients
βkt, δkt,
and αti in absorbance model . in order to do
this, the absorbance model is reformulated as a nonlinear regression model: 

 yktbil=ϕ1tkiϕ2tkisb+ϕ3tki+βktil, 

 where sb, b =
 <dig> …,nkt , is an indicator variable equal
to  <dig> if yktbil is a background measurement and 1
otherwise, ϕtki =
atkiβt, and  

the nonlinear regression model corresponds to the formalism in chapter  <dig> of  <cit>  and can be estimated by the methods herein. the components of the
heteroscedastic variance is estimated by an iteratively reweighted scheme, see
page  <dig> of  <cit> . the i +  <dig> coefficients α^ti are the summarised absorbance measures for each
concentration ci. since negative absorbance measures
are meaningless, all absorbance estimates below a pre-specified value are replaced
by this value. we use the value  <dig>  as the cut point in the current study.

one of the favourable features of the model-based approach to pre-processing
dose-response experiments is outlier detection based on residuals. the residuals
are the difference between the observed values and the values estimated by the
regression model. first, the regression model is fitted to all data. absorbance
measures with residuals greater than a pre-specified number of standard deviations
are regarded as outliers and removed. based on the remaining absorbance measures
the model is fitted again and outliers are detected and removed. this process is
iterated until no outliers are detected or until a pre-specified maximum number of
iterations is reached. in the current study we use  <dig> standard deviations and
iterate the process twice.


estimation of cell line doubling times

when estimating the dose-response curve by the g-model  we need
estimates of t <dig> and the
tc’s. this can be done by estimating the
coefficients n <dig>  t <dig>  and
tc† in the solution to the proposed differential
equation . the resulting estimates of the absorbance measures
α^tc obtained by the pre-processing method are used as
estimates of γn . thus we consider
the following nonlinear model 

  α^ti=α02tt0-sittci†, 

where α <dig> is an estimate of
γn <dig>  si is an
indicator function equal to  <dig> when i =  <dig> and  <dig> otherwise. this nonlinear
model is also formulated in concordance with chapter  <dig> in  <cit> . this gives the nonlinear regression function 

  α^ti=ϕ12tϕ2-si·ϕ3i2+βti, 

where ϕi =
aiβ, and 

 ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3i︸ϕi=1001000⋯⋯⋯00⋯⋯⋯00⋯010⋯0︸i′th︸aiα0ts0tsc1†⋮tsci†︸β. 

the additive error term εtc is assumed to be
normally distributed with mean zero and variance σβ <dig>  the estimates of t <dig> and
tci† are calculated as t^0=1/t^s0t^ci†=1/t^sci† <dig>  the parameterisations t <dig> =
1/ts <dig>  tci†=1/ <dig> are used to ensure that tci† is positive. finally, the estimates of the
tci’s are obtained as 

  t^ci=1t^0-1t^ci†- <dig>  

for i =  <dig> …,i.


estimation of the dose-response curve

in order to make the estimation method robust against outliers and model
misspecifications we suggest to use isotonic regression  <cit>  for which the dose-response curve is found by the piecewise linear and
decreasing function that in square norm is closest to the data. because the
g-model is a piecewise smooth function with a singularity at the
tgi-value a supplementary function is introduced to circumvent biased
estimates. first we define the function Γ  =
1/tc which is an analogue to the g-model
in  without the multiplication by t <dig>  then we estimate the
function Γ at concentrations ci, i
=  <dig> …,i, by the values γ^ <dig> …,γ^i which minimises ∑i=1iγi-1/tc <dig>  subject to γ <dig> ≥
γ <dig> ≥ ⋯ ≥
γi. the Γ-function is
estimated by linear interpolation in the following way 

 Γ^=∑i=1i-1γ^i+γ^i+1-γ^ici+1-cic-ciici≤c<ci+ <dig> 

and the g-model is then estimated by plugging Γ^ and t^ <dig> into  

  g^=t^0·Γ^ifΓ^≥0Γ^otherwise. 

the dose-response model d is similarly estimated pointwise by  with
cell counts n^ and n^ <dig> estimated by the absorbance measures
α^tc and α^ <dig>  the approach used for the g-model is also
recommended for estimating the dose-response curve for the d-model which
also is a piecewise smooth function with a singularity at the tgi-value.
in this case the function Γ  is replaced by
the function Δ =
-n0)/n <dig> 
and the d-model is subsequently estimated by 

  d^=n^0n^+n^0·Δ^ifΔ^≥0Δ^otherwise. 

the dose-response model r is estimated pointwise by  with
n^=α^tc. the dose-response curve for the r-model
r^ is obtained using isotonic regression and linear
interpolation between the pointwise estimates.


estimation of summary statistics

the estimates for gi <dig>  tgi, and
lc <dig> are obtained by the concentration c
where g^, equals  <dig> ,  <dig>  and -1/ <dig>  respectively. the summary
statistic auc <dig> is estimated by the area under the curve where
g^≥ <dig>  to compute confidence intervals for the summary
statistics the following parametric bootstrap algorithm is applied with the number
of iterations equal to j

 <dig>  for j in 1:j

1) generate k plate sets on basis of the pre-processing model
fitted to each cell line.

2) fit the pre-processing model without outlier detection.

3) fit the growth model to the pre-processed absorbance
measurements.

4) calculate the growth inhibition on basis of the
g-model.

5) estimate the summary statistics gi <dig> 
tgi, lc <dig>  and auc <dig> 

 <dig>  estimate a confidence interval for each summary statistic by use of
the  <dig> % and  <dig> % percentiles of the j estimates obtained in step
5).

a similar approach can be used to estimate summary statistics for the
dose-response models d and r with summary statistics obtained by
the concentrations where d^ and r^ equal e.g.  <dig> ,  <dig>  and - <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> ,
respectively.


correction of background absorbance

when the drug under investigation is coloured like e.g. doxorubicin or interacts
with the mts assay, the background absorbance measures are elevated for increasing
drug concentrations. this elevation necessitates correction when estimating the
cell count  <cit> . one method is to include a background control for each concentration
of the drug. such an approach, however, requires a large number of wells.
alternative one may create a number of background plates with a setup similar to
the one used for evaluating the cell count but without seeding cells into them.
next, these plates are pre-processed as described in model-based
pre-processing, which results in measurements of the absorbance caused by
the drug. finally, the excessive absorbance caused by each concentration of the
drug is subtracted from the raw absorbance. this is done as an initial step before
the statistical analysis workflow.

the simulation study
we compare the three dose-response models g, d, and r with
a simulation study where the cell count is estimated through absorbance measurements
based on nine simulated cell line models specified in table  <dig>  for each cell line this table includes the doubling time
t <dig> and the summary statistics gi <dig> 
tgi, and lc <dig>

the drug is added in triplicates for c =  <dig> decreasing concentrations in 96
well culture plates. further, three wells are used as untreated controls and three
wells are used as background controls. in order to illustrate the time dependence the
cell count is estimated at four time points with 24-hour intervals. the net growth of
the cell lines are modelled using the differential equation  with
1/tc† modelled by the following five parameter logistic
function: 

  1/tc†=b-d+b))f 

where a =  <dig>  b = 1/ <dig>  d =  <dig>  f =  <dig>  the parameter
e is specified such that the summary statistics shown in table  <dig> are obtained.

each cell line model is simulated with n <dig> =  <dig>  cells seeded
into each well for all four plates at time t =  <dig> together with the drug. in
order to imitate laboratory conditions the mts assay is assumed added at time points
t1′= <dig> t2′= <dig> t3′= <dig> andt4′= <dig> hours and the absorbance is measured after
tinc =  <dig> hours. consequently, the cell counts are
generated at t1=t1′+tinc/2= <dig> t2= <dig> t3= <dig> andt4= <dig>  in order to attain absorbance measurements the
proportionality factor γ in  is set equal to  <dig> / <dig>  for all
nine cell line models.

in order to investigate the dose-response model g’s capability of
estimating the summary statistics gi <dig>  tgi, and
lc <dig>  noise is added to the system. to mimic real
data this is done according to absorbance model  with parameters chosen in
concordance with the estimates obtained for the b-cell cancer cell line panel
introduced later.

for each cell line model the plate specific background absorbance
βkt is drawn from a lognormal distribution
with mean μβ = - <dig>  and standard deviation
σβ =  <dig> ; the plate specific
multiplicative error δktis likewise drawn from a
lognormal distribution with mean μδ =  <dig> and
standard deviation σδ =  <dig> . the parameters
μβ,
μδ,
σβ, and σδ
are respectively chosen as the mean and standard deviation of the log
transformed estimates for β and δ obtained for the b-cell
cancer cell line panel. finally, the technical variation εktcl
is drawn from a mean zero normal distribution with heteroscedastic
variance |δktαtc+βkt|2ξσϵ <dig> where ξ =  <dig>  and
σε =  <dig>  are chosen as the medians of
the estimates for ξ and σε
obtained for the b-cell cancer cell line panel.

the statistical analysis workflow is used to obtain estimates of the summary
statistics gi <dig>  tgi, and lc48
associated with each cell line for  <dig>  simulated datasets. finally, the mean bias,
standard deviation, and mean square error  are calculated for each cell line
model and time point.

the nci <dig> cancer cell line panel
the cell line screen nci <dig> is utilised to quantify the effect of a cell line’s
doubling time on the gi50-value obtained by the dose-response
model d in real data. pharmacological data generated in the screen and
modelled by the d-model is available online for  <dig>  different compounds:
http://dtp.nci.nih.gov. in this study we apply all compounds available
in the september  <dig> release that are tested at least three times on more than half
the cell lines and for which half of the tested cell lines are affected by the drug.
these criteria are satisfied for  <dig>  different compounds.

the growth inhibition data is averaged for all experiments that are not already
summarised by the mean. next, the g-model is calculated by use of the
transformation . for the dose-response models g and d the
summary statistics gi <dig> and gi50d are estimated using isotonic regression.

the association between the cell lines’ doubling time t0
and the summary statistics gi <dig> and gi50d is determined using pearson’s correlation
coefficient for all  <dig>  compounds. in order to determine whether or not the
transformation causes a significant reduction in the correlation a paired t-test is
used.

the reduction in the aforementioned correlation is further illustrated for
doxorubicin and the drug with the greatest change. for these compounds the summary
statistics gi <dig> and gi50d are plotted against the doubling time
t <dig>  and the pearson’s correlation coefficient is
calculated.

the b-cell cancer cell line panel
a doxorubicin dose-response screen of  <dig> diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and 12
multiple myeloma cell lines is used to illustrate the proposed statistical analysis
workflow. the origin of the cell lines is as listed: kmm- <dig> and kms- <dig> were obtained

the identity of the cell lines was verified by dna barcoding performed every time a
cell line was thawed and brought into culture. in brief, pcr analysis of left over
traces of genomic dna in  <dig>  ng/μl extracted rna from cell lines was
used as template in a multiplex pcr amplifying specific repeated dna regions using
the ampfistr identifiler pcr amplification kit . a
fragment analysis of the amplified pcr products was performed by capillary
electrophoresis . the resulting
fsa file was analysed using the osiris software
 confirming the identity
of the cell lines.


b-cell cancer cell lines and culture conditions

the cell lines were cultured under standard conditions at 37° c; in a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co  <dig> with the
appropriate medium , fetal bovine serum , and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. the cell lines were maintained for a maximum of 20
passages to minimize any long-term culturing effects. penicillin/streptomycin 1%,
rpmi <dig>  imdm and fbs were purchased from invitrogen.


dose-response experiments

doxorubicin was added in quadruplicates for c =  <dig> decreasing
concentrations using the  <dig> well plate setup shown in figure  <dig>  all wells marked with a c in the table were seeded with
cells and doxorubicin was added  <dig> hours later. proliferation assays were
performed using the celltiter 96®; aqueous one solution reagent
cat no. g <dig> . the plates were incubated for
tinc =  <dig> hours and absorbance was estimated at
 <dig> nm using the optima-fluostar . for plate  <dig>  the reagent was added

approach the estimates of the cell count were obtained at approximately
t <dig> =  <dig> hour, and t <dig> =  <dig> hours. to
achieve high reproducibility, the entire experiment was repeated at least thrice.
in order to avoid border effects only non-border wells were used for the

model check
since different drugs have different action mechanisms one should investigate whether
or not the proposed differential equation models data adequately well. this is,
however, not possible if the dose response experiment has not been conducted for more
than two time points. here the experiment was expanded to include five time points
t1′= <dig>  t2′= <dig>  t3′= <dig>  t4′= <dig>  t5′= <dig>  each of the five plates are configured with the same
setup as that described in section dose-response experiments with
tinc =  <dig> hours. this approach gives estimates of
the cell counts at approximately t <dig> =  <dig>  t <dig> =
 <dig>  t <dig> =  <dig>  t <dig> =  <dig>  t5
=  <dig> hours. the experiment was repeated thrice. the differential equation model
is fitted to the data using only t <dig> and t <dig> 
by plotting the data for all time points together with the fitted model it is
possible to observe whether or not the model fits adequately well or whether a more
advanced model is necessary.

RESULTS
the simulation study
dose-response curves for the nine cell line models, described in methods,
are shown in figure  <dig> for the dose-response models
g , d , and r  and time points
t <dig> =  <dig>  t <dig> =  <dig>  and, t3
=  <dig> hours.
dose-response curves for the r-model are shown in panels a,
d, and g, for the time points  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours,
respectively. similarly for the d- and g-models panels
b, e, and h and c, f, and i show
the dose-response curves obtained for time points  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours,
respectively.

the effect of the drug was modelled to be constant through time. however, according
to both the r- and d-models the cell lines’ sensitivity
toward the drug increased with time.

more specifically, for the r-model this is illustrated in panels a, d, and g
of figure  <dig> which depict the obtained dose-response curves
for the three time points. for each cell line model the dose-response curves had the
same sigmoidal shape for all time points. as shown in  the r-model is
indifferent towards the cell line doubling time which entailed that the drug
sensitivity increased equivalently for each cell line model as the drug exposure time
was prolonged. furthermore, cell line model  <dig> was simulated as the most sensitive
with a gi50-value of - <dig>  log <dig>  however, for all time
points, the r-model evaluated it as the fourth most sensitive, surpassed by
cell line models  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> which were simulated with
gi50-values of - <dig> , - <dig> , and, - <dig>  log <dig> 
respectively.

for the d-model the increase in sensitivity was related to the growth rate
of the cell line such that the order of the cell lines’ sensitivity
interchanged through time. this is illustrated in panels b, e, and h where the
dose-response curves obtained by the d-model are shown for the three time
points. the cell line models  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were respectively fast and
slowly growing. accordingly, the increase in sensitivity through time was much more
pronounced for cell line models  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> than for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in particular the
fast growth rate of cell line model  <dig> and slow growth rate of cell line model 6
caused the obtained gi50d-values to interchange throughout the three time
points.

the cell lines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were simulated with gi50-values of
- <dig> , - <dig> , and, - <dig>  log <dig>  respectively; however, the
gi50d-values obtained by the d-model were
indistinguishable in panel h. additionally, the sensitivity level for cell line
models  <dig> and  <dig> were reversed such that cell line  <dig> was evaluated to be more sensitive
to the drug than cell line  <dig> 

this implied that the summary statistics obtained by the r- and
d-models were biased and relative to the cell lines’ sensitivity they
were ordered incorrectly. time independent summary statistics obtained by the
g-model equalled those shown in table  <dig> 

the dose-response models g and d are continuous everywhere and
differentiable everywhere except at the tgi-value. the latter results in the
singularity occurring at that value for both functions. since the r-model is
continuous and differentiable everywhere such singularities do not occur for this
model.

for each cell line model,  <dig>  independent datasets were simulated with a culture
plate and noise setup as outlined in methods. the mean bias, standard
deviation, and mse for the summary statistics gi <dig>  tgi,
and lc <dig> obtained by the outlined statistical analysis workflow
applied to the g-model are shown in table  <dig> for
the nine cell line models and three time points. the statistical analysis
workflow combined with the g-model was capable of producing unbiased
estimates of the time independent summary statistics. the standard deviation and mse
were generally smallest for fast growing cell lines and decreased as the drug
exposure time was prolonged.

model check
to check if the proposed differential equation models the dose response data
adequately a time experiment was conducted. as an example of the model check the
model-based pre-processed absorbance data for five different time points are shown in
figure  <dig> for the cell line su-dhl- <dig>  model  was
fitted using only the t <dig> =  <dig> and t <dig> =  <dig> hour
time points. in this instance the model was found to fit the data adequately and that
restricting the model fit to two time points yielded satisfactory results. however,
it seems that the growth inhibition was underestimated for the large concentrations.
this was the case for most cell lines and was a consequence of only using the  <dig> and
 <dig> hour time points for estimating model .
absorbance measurements growth curves for the cell line su-dhl- <dig> for five time

curves for the cell line untreated  and for all ten concentrations
 are shown. in this panel the blue, red, and black curves correspond to
the estimated growth curves at the summary statistics gi <dig> 
tgi, and lc <dig> 

the nci <dig> cancer cell line panel
the nci <dig> dose-response screen was used to illustrate how data obtained by the
d-model can be transformed into the g-model by use of  and
thereby be corrected for the cell line doubling time t <dig> and
duration of the experiment. for the  <dig>  compounds that satisfied the selection
criteria the association between growth inhibition and growth rate was determined by
pearson’s correlation coefficient between t <dig> and the
summary statistics gi <dig> and gi50d estimated by the dose-response models g and
d, respectively. kernel estimated density functions of the correlations
obtained using the two models are shown in figure 7a.
because the bias associated with the d-model renders fast growing cell lines
overly sensitive, the correlation between t <dig> and the summary
statistic gi50d was biased upwards. the average decrease of the
aforementioned correlation, by adjusting for the cell line doubling time, was  <dig> 
, p-value < <dig> ). more specifically, a significant
negative correlation was found for  <dig> compounds using the d-model and 123
compounds using the g-model. in contrast, a significant positive correlation
was found for  <dig> compounds using the d-model and only  <dig> using the
g-model.

to the greatest change in correlation by plotting the summary statistics

the greatest change in correlation, specifically, from  <dig> , ) for the uncorrected d-model to - <dig> , ) for the g-model.

the b-cell cancer cell line panel

statistical analysis workflow. doxorubicin is a coloured agent that
elevates the absorbance measurements with increasing concentrations. in

concentration is plotted. this was corrected for according to correction of
background absorbance prior to the application of the suggested
pre-processing procedure.

correction is shown in panels c and d. in panels e and f the results of the

model-based pre-processing is illustrated in panels g and h. when
comparing panels e and f to g and h we noticed that the mean absorbance was estimated
with a considerable lower variance when the model-based pre-processing was used. a
cross marks the measurements that are found to be outliers and for example two of the
un-treated control measurements for plate  <dig> were deemed to be outliers as illustrated
in panel h. in panel h these measurements were clearly extreme values, however, prior
to the model-based pre-processing this was not the case.for each cell line residual
plots of the final pre-processing models were investigated to ensure that the
absorbance model fitted the data reasonably well. for cell line kms-12-bm the
residual plot is illustrated in figure  <dig>  panel a shows
the residual plot obtained when the heteroscedasticity of the variance was ignored,
whilst panel b shows the residual plot when the variance model was fitted. these
plots confirm that the variance model was capable of fitting the heteroscedastic
variance observed in dose-response experiments.

discussion
in the present study a differential equation that models drug induced growth inhibition
of human tumour cell lines was established. based on this equation a novel model for
summarising dose-response experiments was produced, that in combination with a
statistical workflow, is capable of generating unbiased time independent summary
statistics.

to determine if the differential equation is adequate for modelling real data a time
experiment based on doxorubicin was conducted. the experiment included five time points
of which only the first and last were used to fit the differential equation. the
differential equation was found to model the data adequately, albeit the use of only two
time points may lead to an underestimated drug efficiency for large doses. since the
differential equation was found adequate, a simulation study was performed to document
the potential bias when using existing methods, and the robustness of the workflow. we
deduced that under the proposed differential equation these summary statistics are
biased estimators of growth inhibition so that the drug effect is amplified concurrently
with increasing growth rate of the cell lines.

in kondoh et al.  <cit>   <dig> representative anticancer drugs from the nci <dig> screen were used to
illustrate the association between cell line growth rate and drug sensitivity assessed
by the d-model. they found the growth rate was positively correlated with drug
sensitivity. we propose that this finding is partly caused by systematic bias induced by
the experimental setup of the cell line screens. since the difference between the
treated and un-treated cell line will increase with time, the effect of the drug will
seem greater for fast growing cell lines. we showed that by transforming data obtained
by the d-model into the g-model the correlation between doubling time
and drug resistance decreased significantly. we do not argue against drug resistance
being associated with growth rate as the authors successfully discover and validate a
potential new anticancer drug, we merely suggest that removing the design-based bias may
lead to a range of new potential drugs to be investigated.

in order to illustrate the suggested workflow for dose-response experiments, a study of
 <dig> cell lines tested for drug resistance at  <dig> different concentrations of doxorubicin
was presented. the results illustrate that it is possible to gain realistic estimates of
the variance of the growth inhibition characteristics, which is of great value in the
application of dose-response studies.

practical considerations
since the establishment of nci <dig>  dose-response screens of human tumour cell lines
have been one of the most commonly used methods for discovering new anticancer drugs  <cit> . the approach has mostly been used to discover drugs that are potent in a
considerable part of the tested cell lines originating from various tumour types.
with this purpose in mind, the bias introduced by analysing cell lines with different
doubling times has little or no influence on the conclusions. more recently, the cell
line screens have been used to discover treatments that are only potent in a small
proportion of the tested cell lines and hence in a small proportion of the cancer
patients. ignoring the doubling time of the cell lines may reduce the capability of
discovering such drugs since slowly growing cell lines may appear resistant to the
drug.

the issue of growth rate bias may be remedied by using cell lines with approximately
the same doubling time or alternatively by conducting the experiments using
individual time spans corresponding to a given number of doubling times for each cell
line. based on the latter approach bracht et al.  <cit>  took the doubling times into account by conducting the dose-response
experiments such that each of the  <dig> cell lines was exposed to the drug for three
cell line specific doubling times. for large cell line screens it is neither feasible
to generate diverse panels consisting of cancer cell lines with similar doubling
times nor is it practical to conduct each experiment for different time spans. the
latter option is further complicated since it may not be possible to keep slowly
growing cell lines in the exponential growth phase for several doubling times
throughout the experiment. the models used in cell line screens nci <dig>  <cit> , jfcr <dig>  <cit> , and cmt <dig>  <cit>  are based on fixed drug exposure times. we established transformations of
these models so that each cell line’s doubling time can be accounted for.

methodological considerations
modelling the growth of a cell line exposed to an anticancer drug by the simple
differential equation  facilitated a meticulous analysis of existing summary
statistics for cell line based dose-response studies of growth inhibition. it may be
possible to establish a differential equation that leads to either the d or
r model. however, the authors have not been able to do so in an
unblemished fashion. it is thus difficult to determine which assumptions must be met
for the results of these models to be unbiased.

the differential equation was based on exponential cell growth which seems a
reasonably assumption since all drug response assays strive toward using the
exponential growth phase of the cell lines for the out-read window. similarly, the
rate for cells going into cell cycle arrest or death is assumed exponential and
concentration dependent, partly due to computational convenience and partly because
no obvious alternative is present. it should be emphasized the assumption of an
exponential rate for cells going into cell cycle arrest or death induce a constant
drug efficiency throughout the experiment. however, since different drugs induce
growth inhibition by different mechanisms, the established differential equation 
is oversimplified and may therefore model the growth of a cell line exposed to a drug
inadequately. it would be interesting to establish more complex systems of
differential equations of cell culture growth in combination with more measurements
during drug exposure time  <cit> . this would allow estimation of drug induced growth inhibition with
improved precision and hence increased biological understanding.

a model-based approach to pre-processing based on a nonlinear regression model was
introduced. this model efficiently and simultaneously addresses a number of issues
such as background absorbance correction, multiplicative seeding effects and
heteroscedastic variance of absorbance measures. all are well-known nuisance effects
in cellular/bacterial growth studies  <cit> . the modelling approach also facilitated outlier detection by residual
analysis and standard model checks from regression theory  <cit> . the dose-response relationship was modelled by the growth curves arising
from the solution to the posed differential equation. this lead to pointwise
estimates of the dose-response curve of the g-model and interpolation of the
curve was done by isotonic regression which is robust against outliers and model
misspecifications  <cit> .

providing precision estimates of the growth inhibition characteristics in this
complex setting is not straightforward, so parametric bootstrap of the nonlinear
model of the absorbance measurements was used  <cit> . alternatively the statistical delta method could have been applied  <cit> . although feasible, this would have required complicated approximations by
taylor series expansions, and bootstrapping is generally considered to have superior
small sample properties  <cit> .

the dose-response model r  based on relative cell counts is very
appealing due to its simplicity. moreover, it is a smooth function so it is possible
to fit parametric models to the dose-response curve of r which facilitates
extrapolation. when extrapolation is necessary it is possible to fit a parametric
model to the dose-response curve of r <cit>  and subsequently transform the result into the dose-response curve of
g using . this approach facilitates estimation of time independent
summary statistics by extrapolation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that conventionally used dose-response models can give rise
to biased summary statistics erroneously correlated to the growth rate of the cell
lines. we have developed novel summary statistics of dose-response experiments that are
applicable on existing data and independent of time under the proposed differential
equation. consequently, we expect that the present approach will be able to improve
future drug evaluation studies.
