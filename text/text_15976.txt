BACKGROUND
in the last decade, integrative genomics approaches that take into account genotypic, molecular profiling and complex traits in segregating populations have been developed to dissect the genetics of complex traits such as human diseases or economically important traits in livestock or plants. combining qtl mapping and high throughput transcriptome data is proving useful for characterizing qtl regions and elucidating genes and biological pathways that affect complex traits  <cit> . the term "genetical genomics" or "systems genetics" refers to such a combinatorial approach.

one strategy commonly used by authors working in this context was based on the identification of genes having an eqtl that colocalizes with the qtl responsible for the complex trait of interest. such a strategy considers the expression level of each gene available on a microarray as a quantitative trait and uses genetic markers to identify genomic regions that regulate gene expression phenotypes; these regions are named eqtl . the function of the gene that its mrna level is controlled by a region can provide new functional information about the candidate gene sought in the eqtl region. colocalization of eqtl with the qtl for complex trait can provide relevant information about the causative gene for the complex trait of interest. this strategy has been widely used in various species . when combined with mathematical modeling proposed by schadt et al.  <cit> , this strategy becomes very efficient for distinguishing causal from reactive genes for the complex trait and for identifying the "driver" genes and pathways that are responsible for a complex trait.

another strategy is based on defining subtypes for a complex trait using gene expression profiles. it is well known that a population measured for a complex trait through one criteria  may actually have distinct molecular subtypes for this complex phenotype. use of gene expression profiles may allow the identification of such biologically distinct subtypes. the standard procedure is to identify genes whose expression is correlated to the complex trait and then perform a classification of individuals in order to observe specific subtypes. applied on a segregating population, the identification of subtypes combined with qtl analysis performed for these subtypes can separately improve sensitivity of qtl detection and reveal new loci. this strategy was first performed by schadt et al.   <cit>  using a mouse population and then in  <dig> by our team using a chicken segregating population  <cit> . in these two studies, two qtl were observed for the fat mass, one initially observed on the full f <dig> set and another one only observed when one subtype was removed. as illustrated by these studies, the core of the approach is the determination of subtypes within a segregating population on the basis of the genes correlated to the complex trait. in the present paper, we propose to identify these genes using a method called factor analysis for multiple testing  which takes into account the hidden dependence structure that may result from population structure or/and technical artefact of gene expression profiling experiment, independent of the trait of interest . we then show the utility of this method to define phenotype subtypes more accurately and to reveal interaction between  <dig> qtl.

RESULTS
identification of animal subtypes for fatness trait using the famt method
the first step was to identify which of the  <dig> genes expressed in the liver were correlated to the trait of interest, the abdominal fat weight , in the  <dig> related offspring's. pearson correlation between hepatic transcript levels and af trait identified  <dig> genes significantly associated at the nominal p-value of  <dig>  without any correction for multiple tests. to increase the size of this list, le mignon et al.  <cit>  added to this first list, genes significantly differentially expressed between the  <dig> leanest and fattest birds in the family. as such, a list of  <dig> genes was obtained with a significance threshold of  <dig>   without any correction for multiple tests. it should be noted that applying correction for multiple testing resulted in no gene being differentially expressed. this result might be explained by either a poor genetic variability between animals, which are half sib offsprings, or dependence between genes. indeed, standard methods to find significant correlation between gene expressions and a variable of interest ignore the correlations among expression profiles  <cit> . this dependence structure leads to correlation among test statistics, which leads to under representation of the smallest p-values  <cit> . this can be explained by a number of unmeasured or unmodeled factors independent of the variable of interest  that may influence the expression of any particular gene . these factors may induce additional variability in the expression levels and decrease the power to detect the true correlation with the variables of interest. recently, several studies have introduced models taking into account this gene dependence. in particular, friguet et al.  <cit>  propose to model this sharing of information by a factor analysis structure in a method called factor analysis for multiple testing . the estimated factors in the model capture components of the expression heterogeneity independent of the effects of the variable of interest. we applied this method to our data:  <dig> transcripts significantly correlated to the af trait were identified taking into account the existence of six factors containing a common information shared by all genes and independent from the af trait. the interpretation of these factors was analyzed and discussed in blum et al.  <cit> . for the further analyses in the present paper, we subtracted the linear dependence kernel defined by the six factors from the  <dig> raw gene expressions to obtain  <dig> factor-adjusted expressions as in blum et al.  <cit> .

the second step was to identify the best gene list that distinguishes potential subtypes for the af trait within the  <dig> offspring. separate hierarchical clustering of the birds was performed using either the  <dig>  and the  <dig> genes obtained by classical methods in step one , or the  <dig> genes obtained by the famt method . for the latter we used the famt adjusted expression values in the clustering algorithm. the results of the three clusterings are shown in figure  <dig>  the set of  <dig> genes is clearly more efficient to separate fat and lean birds, and to generate different subtypes for the af trait. as indicated in figure 1c, this gene list allows us to clearly distinguish two subtypes for the fat birds and two other subtypes for the lean birds in addition to one subgroup mixing lean, intermediate and fat birds. this gene list includes almost all of the genes of the  <dig> genes  but is twice as large. this larger number suggests that correlation between many gene expressions and the variable of interest is underestimated due to the hidden dependence structure. finally, this gene list is quite different from the  <dig> gene set with only 69% common genes, suggesting a notable number of false positive genes in the latter due to the absence of correction for multiple testing and for gene dependence.

these results clearly show the importance of taking into account the gene dependence due to additional sources of variation, especially when the expression variation related to the variable of interest may be low and therefore easily impacted by these additional sources.

a new qtl revealed by removing one of the two lean subtypes: genetic characterization of this subtype
based on the clustering obtained using the famt adjusted expression , we performed linkage analyses for the af trait on the chromosome  <dig>  either with the whole family or by removing successively one of the five subgroups . as indicated in figure 2b, the majority of analyses gave the same lrt curves with the expected af qtl located around  <dig> cm on the chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . however, after removing the lean subtype called lean <dig>  a new significant qtl  was detected on a proximal chromosome  <dig> locus around  <dig> cm with an effect of  <dig>  phenotypic standard deviation. alternative and not necessarily exclusive hypotheses can be drawn to explain the detection of the second qtl after the exclusion of the lean <dig> group:

1) the first hypothesis is the presence of animals having an af value in disagreement with the paternal q/q haplotype in the excluded lean <dig> group. removing such birds, especially when their af values are extreme, can largely increase the power of qtl detection when the design analyzed has a low size. we determined for each offspring the q/q haplotype corresponding to the proximal qtl . two out of the  <dig> birds of the lean <dig> subtype have the q paternal haplotype that contributes to a high fat mass  . however, we can notice that the lean <dig> subtype is in the same configuration with  <dig> extreme lean birds as well  with the q haplotype at the new qtl  but does not allow to reveal this latter after being removed.

animal labels f <dig> to f <dig> indicate the  <dig> fattest chickens, l <dig> to l <dig> the  <dig> leanest chickens and i <dig> to i <dig> the  <dig> intermediate chickens.

the two letters indicate the q or q haplotype inherited from the sire, with a probability > 99% for the qtl at  <dig> cm  or the qtl at  <dig> cm ; x indicates a probability < 99%. the probability of inheriting the paternal q versus q haplotype was calculated by qtlmap software only on the basis of marker information in the region of interest.

2) the second hypothesis is that the proximal and distal qtl on chromosome  <dig> interact with each other. in our specific case, this means that the allele configuration of the distal qtl at  <dig> cm influences the effect of the proximal qtl and therefore masks it when the whole family is used. to investigate this explanation further, we analyzed the paternal haplotype at the qtl around  <dig> cm for the different birds of the lean <dig> subtype . we determined the paternal haplotype for  <dig> out of the  <dig> birds belonging to this subtype considering a probability > 99%. interestingly, all of five birds have the same haplotype q. this observation suggests that the two qtl are interacting: the presence of the q allele at the distal locus enhances the allelic effect at the proximal qtl and the presence of q allele at the distal locus weakens the allelic effect at the proximal qtl.

interaction testing between the proximal and distal af qtl on chromosome 5
considering a transmission probability greater than 99%, we determined the paternal haplotype for the proximal and distal qtl in  <dig> birds  and proximal qtl ) respectively as shown in table  <dig> 

using these  <dig> birds, we first performed a two-way analysis of variance considering the two qtl as two fixed factors with an interaction between them. as indicated in figure 3a, the analysis shows clearly a significant interaction between the two qtl . the difference between q versus q for the proximal qtl is higher when the haplotype is q at the distal qtl  than when the haplotype is q .

we also tested the qtl interaction using the qtlmap software with the "interaction model" . the procedure tests the model: "no qtl" versus " <dig> qtl in interaction with another known qtl". we chose to set the location of the distal qtl at  <dig> cm, corresponding to the maximum lrt. compared to the analysis of variance, the advantage of this qtl analysis is to set the location for only one of the two qtl presumed in interaction, increasing the number of birds analyzed  and then allowing to better localize the second qtl. as depicted in figure 3b, the green curve corresponding to the interaction model analysis shows clearly a significant qtl in the proximal region  in interaction with the fixed qtl at  <dig> cm. furthermore, an additive model testing the hypothesis "one qtl" versus " <dig> qtl" does not highlight the proximal qtl , which is consistent with our expectation that the two qtl are in interaction.

to obtain a better estimate of the proximal qtl location, we developed six novel informative snp markers in the proximal region at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cm respectively and genotyped the  <dig> animals accordingly. as indicated in figure 3b, where the red curve corresponds to the interaction model performed with additional markers, the most probable position of the proximal qtl in interaction with the distal qtl on the chromosome  <dig> was found at  <dig> cm  with a confidence interval  from  <dig> to  <dig> cm.

among the selected  <dig> genes, we identified  <dig> genes having a similar qtl profile as the abdominal fatness trait on the chromosome  <dig> . these genes have a distal eqtl colocalizing with the af distal region . they also have a proximal qtl colocalizing with the af proximal region, with an interaction with the distal eqtl . interestingly, one of these genes has the highest correlation with the af trait . moreover, all  <dig> genes were differentially expressed  between the two lean subtypes previously detected . this observation can be interpreted as another illustration of the interaction effect between the proximal and distal af qtl, but at the gene expression level. taken together, these observations suggest that at least one of these  <dig> genes may be a signature of the causative mutation underlying the adiposity trait. these genes produce unknown proteins and/or proteins not particularly related to the adiposity. further investigations will be necessary to confirm such a signature and clarify the role of these genes in lipid metabolism and adiposity.

for each gene, are given the oligonucleotide identifier , the hgnc abbreviation , the pearson correlation with the abdominal fatness , the maximum lrt location in cm and the maximum lrt  using either the classical model or the interaction model. the two last columns are related to the statistical test comparing the expression between the lean <dig> and the lean <dig> subtypes: the differential expression between the two subtypes  and the p-value associated are indicated. * and +: p-value at the chromosome level < <dig>  and < <dig>  respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show the value of determining phenotype subtypes underlying a complex trait by using gene expressions. this subtype identification combined with qtl mapping improves the characterization of qtl responsible for adiposity, by revealing a new qtl in interaction with a previous one. this study also highlights the interest to use famt procedure to define more accurately these subtypes for a complex trait compared to classical methods. at the core of the approach proposed here is the phenotype subtype identification, which is still rarely used in the genetical genomics field and was reported once a few years ago by schadt and colleagues  <cit> . in our report we show the advantage of using such approach in revealing interaction among qtl and discovery of new qtl underlying complex traits.
