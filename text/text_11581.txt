BACKGROUND
a growing number of studies have shown that non-native species are able to evolve rapidly following introduction into a new region . introduced species may be subject to “episodic selection”, i.e. rapid genetic and phenotypic changes possibly leading to incipient speciation caused by sudden and intense environmental disturbance  <cit> . the concept of “accelerated evolution” may involve two processes: rapid phenotypic change of a particular trait due to differential selective pressure on existing genetic variation, or the generation of de novo phenotypic variation in environments where the organism is poorly adapted  <cit> . de novo mutation and mitotic recombination probably account for the rapid phenotypic diversification observed in many introduced fungal pathogens lacking initial genetic diversity, including oomycetes  <cit> .

to date, most mechanisms responsible for de novo mutation remain elusive. aneuploidy, the loss or gain of chromosomes in a nucleus, is frequently generated and can create substantial variation in gene expression by effectively altering gene dosage. aneuploidy is thus a potentially effective and widespread mechanism for developing novel phenotypic variation in a clonal population . for example, antifungal drug resistance in several human pathogenic fungi has been attributed to aneuploidy  <cit> .

in this study, we employed high throughput sequencing to characterize genomic diversity underlying rapid phenotypic diversification in the clonal organism phytophthora ramorum. p. ramorum is the exotic oomycete pathogen responsible for sudden oak death in north america  <cit> , sudden larch death in the uk and ireland  <cit> , and ramorum blight in the nursery trade both in north america and europe  <cit> . its origin is still unknown, but four distinct clonal lineages have been identified. the lineages are believed to have originated from distinct genetically isolated populations in their  region of origin  <cit> . the na <dig>  na <dig>  and to a lesser degree the eu <dig> lineages are present in north american plant nurseries, while only the eu <dig> and eu <dig> lineages are found in europe . only the na <dig> lineage has escaped into natural forest settings on the west coast of california, where it causes the disease known as sudden oak death  <cit> . in oaks, disease is caused by lethal trunk cankers, which do not extend below ground  <cit> .

despite being clonal, isolates of the na <dig> lineage display striking variation in colony morphology and growth rate not readily observed in the other lineages. in culture, wild type  p. ramorum usually grows as a uniform, roughly circular colony mostly appressed to the culture media  <cit> . however, some na <dig> isolates exhibit irregular, unstable, usually slower growing and “fluffy” colony types, referred to as non-wild type . some nwt isolates become senescent, i.e. they cease to grow upon subculturing. inoculation experiments have shown that isolates with nwt morphology are less aggressive than wt isolates .

recently, we have demonstrated that p. ramorum isolates originating from trunks of oak  are more likely to show nwt and senescent phenotypes than those from foliage of california bay   <cit> . transcriptome analysis revealed that de-repression of hundreds of transposable elements  and down-regulation of crinkler effector homologs  were common in oak isolates, yet this expression pattern was never observed in isolates from california bay. our finding of phenotypic differences between isolates from oak and california bay is significant in the context of sudden oak death. it has been demonstrated that oak is a dead-end host with oak infection initiated only via asexual airborne propagules from nearby foliar hosts, most importantly california bay, which does not develop trunk cankers  <cit> . consistent with this view, microsatellite markers did not reveal any genetic subdivision between isolates from california bay and oak hosts  <cit> .

together these observations lead us to hypothesize that in oak, p. ramorum undergoes phenotypic diversification after infection. this process could be termed host-induced phenotypic diversification  because the observed phenotypic changes are host species-dependent. in our case, hipd is commonly associated with oak, rarely with tanoak, and is virtually absent in bay or rhododendron. to our knowledge phenomena similar to hipd have not been reported in the literature. however, the putative de novo phenotypic variation observed among oak isolates and their reduced aggressiveness  could be comparable to the increased accumulation of deleterious mutations reported for zoonotic viruses and intercellular symbiotic bacteria when horizontal transmission between hosts was restricted  <cit> . in this sense, hipd could be compatible with the current view that oak is a dead-end host for p. ramorum. this view appears reasonable in light of the fact that sporulation of p. ramorum from oak bark has yet to be observed.

in this study, we attempt to establish direct evidence of the nature of hipd and of its genetic basis through the artificial inoculation of na <dig> isolates on different hosts. we were able to experimentally recreate hipd, and subsequently through high throughput sequencing-based methods we demonstrated that aneuploidy was associated with hipd. although eu <dig> isolates of p. ramorum lineage have exclusively shown wt colony morphology  <cit> , eu <dig> isolates with nwt colony morphology have recently been obtained from a rare host, lawson cypress . we show that these are due to similar chromosomal rearrangements. the observation of hipd in two distinct evolutionary lineages of p. ramorum further emphasizes its potential biological and epidemiological significance.

RESULTS
scoring for wt and nwt colony morphology
some wt cultures developed into nwt colonies upon subculturing  <cit> . for example, when a culture of oak isolate pr- <dig> showing wt morphology was subcultured,  <dig> out of  <dig> colonies displayed nwt morphology within seven days . additionally, some pr- <dig> nwt cultures also became senescent. in contrast, na <dig> isolates from foliar hosts consistently displayed homogenous wt colony type as demonstrated by the fact that no nwt was observed out of a total of  <dig> subcultures. nwt morphology was significantly more common in pr- <dig> than in isolates from foliar hosts . when nwt colony morphology was observed upon further subculturing, we assigned the original isolate to the nwt phenotype, even if the original isolate did not consistently display nwt colony morphology. thus, nwt colony phenotype in this study was defined as the ability to develop the nwt morphology upon subculturing. to track this phenomenon, we precisely indicate  <cit>  colony phenotypes and the known history for each isolate in our results . for example, pr-1556#7# <dig>  indicates isolate of pr-1556#7# <dig> was originally isolated from a california bay and subsequently passed through oak via an artificial inoculation, and then transferred to, and recovered from a race tube.table  <dig> summary of phenotypic conversion upon passage experiments

experimental generation of phenotypes associated with oak isolates
we hypothesized that the oak host environment in which p. ramorum grows induces hipd. in order to experimentally demonstrate hipd, phenotypic changes during host passage experiments were monitored. two passage experiments were conducted on oak using four california bay isolates as inocula. in the first passage experiment, two wt p. ramorum isolates, pr- <dig>  and pr- <dig> , were inoculated into stems of mature canyon live oak  and shreve oak  in july  <dig>  <cit> . in december  <dig> and april  <dig>   <dig> and 40 weeks post-inoculation, respectively, the pathogen was re-isolated from lesions that had formed in the phloem and underlying xylem . these are termed “re-isolates” hereafter. thirty-nine percent of re-isolates collected 20 weeks post-inoculation  and 60 % collected 40 weeks  were assigned to nwt phenotype. in contrast, none of  <dig> in vitro subcultures of isolates pr- <dig> and pr- <dig> displayed nwt phenotype .fig.  <dig> 
nwt colony phenotype was experimentally reproducible by oak passage experiment. a scraping off the outer bark 20 weeks post-inoculation revealed diseased tissue. the red mark at the center indicates the inoculation point. isolates recovered from circle and square marks yielded wt and nwt colonies, respectively. b isolates show diverse colony morphology. top left: pr- <dig> , top right: pr- <dig> , both are wild type isolates used as inocula. middle left and right: examples of re-isolates from canyon live oak showing nwt colony morphology. bottom left: a re-isolate from canyon live oak showing a wt colony morphology, bottom right: an example of early senescence



in order to obtain baseline phenotypic conversion rate in foliar hosts, california bay leaves were inoculated with two wt isolates, pr- <dig>  and nd <dig> , and re-isolate phenotypes were evaluated. none of the  <dig> re-isolates derived over 25 weeks from pr- <dig> and nd <dig> inoculations showed nwt morphology. together this series of passage experiments indicate that canyon live oak and shreve oak, but not california bay, induced phenotypic conversion from wt to nwt; therefore, we conclude that hipd is experimentally reproducible. in addition, the nwt isolate pr <dig> was passed through california bay to evaluate the potential reversibility of nwt colony phenotype by epigenetics or phenotypic plasticity. however, we failed to detect the reversibility with certainty: two out of  <dig>  re-isolates derived from pr <dig> displayed nwt colony morphology, which did not differ significantly  from the rate of nwt morphology observed for in vitro subcultures .

the oak inoculation experiment was repeated with different isolates, pr- <dig> and pr- <dig>  in july  <dig>  in december  <dig> ,  <dig> axenic cultures of pr- <dig> and pr- <dig> were re-isolated from phloem tissue of resulting cankers . contrary to the first passage experiment, no isolates with nwt morphology or senescence were observed at the moment they were cultured out of the hosts in which they were inoculated. however, punctuated growth patterns, one of the common characteristics of the nwt phenotype, were observed  <dig> to 16 weeks after they were placed in race tubes and monitored .

validation of experimentally induced phenotypic conversion by means of global mrna profiling
re-isolates and isolates from naturally infected oak with nwt phenotype were morphologically indistinguishable. we have previously reported that wt and nwt isolates show distinct global mrna patterns  <cit> , indicating physiological differences associated with the colony types. in order to validate the experimental induction of hipd, we performed global mrna profiling for the two isolates pr- <dig>  and pr- <dig>  used in the oak passage experiment and five re-isolates with wt or nwt colony types . pr- <dig> , an isolate derived from a naturally infected oak exhibiting a distinct global mrna expression pattern associated with nwt phenotype  <cit>  was included in the analysis as a “nwt standard”. cluster analysis of global mrna profiles revealed two major groups, each associated with a specific colony phenotype. the two wt isolates used in the inoculation trial and two re-isolates showing wt phenotype formed one group , while the three re-isolates showing nwt phenotype plus pr- <dig> formed the other group . hence, global mrna profiling corroborates that isolates with nwt phenotype are physiologically equivalent whether obtained directly from naturally infected trees or obtained from artificially inoculated oak. de-repression of transposable elements , a hallmark of the nwt phenotype, was observed in the three nwt re-isolates . in addition, down-regulation of crinkler effector homologs, which was common in oak isolates, was observed in two nwt re-isolates derived from pr- <dig>  we have therefore experimentally established that the nwt phenotype is generated in oak.fig.  <dig> transcriptome analyses support host-induced phenotypic diversification. a eight cdna samples from petri plate cultures were clustered based on their global expression patterns of  <dig>  transcripts. group a consists of the two california bay isolates used as inocula and re-isolates from canyon live oak, all having wt colony phenotype. isolates in group b are either from naturally infected coast live oak or from artificially-inoculated canyon live oak, and all have nwt colony phenotype. b examples of mrna profiles of p. ramorum genes differentially expressed between group a and group b. the order of isolates is same as that in a. a gene model number and its annotation are shown for each profile. gene expression of pr_ <dig> and pr_ <dig> were estimated by qrt-pcr, and log <dig> fold changes  are shown. pr_ <dig> was used as endogenous control gene, and expression levels were standardized to the genome sequence strain pr- <dig>  for pr_ <dig>  because the reference pr- <dig> had a high expression level, its expression was offset by  <dig> for the presentation purpose. error bars represent sd in technical replicates. for pr_ <dig> and pr_ <dig>  bars represent estimates of the relative expression levels according to microarray mrna profiling



re-isolates showed accelerated growth rate in race tubes
none of the  <dig> pr- <dig> and pr- <dig>  re-isolates obtained in the second oak passage experiment initially had a nwt phenotype. among the re-isolates in the first oak passage experiment, wt re-isolates occasionally displayed nwt morphology on subsequent subculturing, suggesting nwt phenotype can be latent and develop during continued cultivation on artificial media. although no nwt colony morphology was observed among isolates in the second passage experiment, we hypothesized the likelihood of wt to nwt conversion would be elevated in the re-isolates from oaks. in order to address this possibility, three transfers each were made from four re-isolates from the second oak passage experiment, the two original isolates, and a camellia isolate, onto 40 cm-long race tubes. growth rates were monitored once a week . in the course of 18 weeks, pr- <dig>  and pr- <dig>  displayed consistent growth rates , while growth rates of wt re-isolates from oaks  accelerated or decelerated considerably after 10 weeks. the accelerated growth rate observed in re-isolates is hereafter referred to as growth acceleration phenotype . in the race tube, the hyphal tips at the growing front do not always extend at the same rate: the fastest-growing hyphal tip can ramify, expand and take over the colony front. in other words, a fast growing trait can be selected when variation in growth rates of individual hyphal tips occurs, which is likely the case for gap.fig.  <dig> 
wt re-isolates from oak became differentiated from california bay isolates on race tubes. growth rates of triplicates of california bay isolates a pr- <dig> and b pr- <dig> were relatively constant for 18 weeks. growth rates of triplicates of two re-isolates derived from each of c pr- <dig> and d pr- <dig> were also relatively constant in the first eight weeks . however, fluctuation in growth rates became apparent after ten weeks in the race tube 



all cultures were transferred back to duplicate petri plates once the mycelial fronts reached the far end of race tubes. in total, three of the four original re-isolates showed nwt or senescent colony types in at least one replicate after recovery from the race tubes . in contrast, none of the california bay and camellia isolates showed nwt phenotypes after recovery from race tubes . in summary, the race tube experiment demonstrated that wt re-isolates from oak have a greater or latent propensity for the conversion to nwt colony morphology than foliar isolates .table  <dig> colony phenotypes after retrieval from race tubes

analysis of chromosomal copy number variations 
the results of the inoculation experiments uphold our interpretation of the mechanisms underlying hipd, implying that the environment in oak cankers triggers de novo mutations in p. ramorum. as a potential source of the nwt phenotype, we examined changes in chromosomal copy number, since these have been reported in association with phenotypic alterations after exposure to antifungal chemicals  <cit> . a read-depth based method called bic-seq  <cit>  detected variations in chromosomal copy number  among na <dig> p. ramorum isolates. remarkably, ccnvs appeared to be colony phenotype dependent. while  <dig> out of the  <dig> wt na <dig> isolates displayed 0– <dig> regions with ccnvs , all of the seven isolates with nwt colony phenotype, including four oak isolates and three re-isolates from oak, produced 171– <dig> regions with ccnvs   .table  <dig> summary of snp and ccnv analyses

aaccording to ccnv and allele ratio analyses, isolates were categorized into five groups. details are in the main text


bna <dig> clonal isolates subjected to a series of passage experiments were consolidated to highlight the generation of ccnvs. these isolates are also listed under na <dig> isolates


cthe three eu <dig> isolates were obtained from the middle, bottom and top of a ca. 4 m long lesion on chamaecyparis lawsoniana




the majority  of ccnvs found among the seventeen wt isolates clustered in one of  <dig> genomic locations, and among these  <dig> locations,  <dig> locations were at the vicinity of tes. apart from these hypervariable short segments displaying ccnvs, no major chromosomal alterations were detected in the wt isolates, which resulted in a largely linear red line across the concatenated scaffolds when wt isolates were compared . additionally, average heterozygous allele ratios, using 10 kb long non-overlapping sliding window, were close to one . these observations indicate that the seventeen wt isolates have a balanced set of chromosomes. this group of isolates was thus classified as the “normal euploid group” . in contrast, all seven nwt isolates had extensive ccnvs. for instance, when genomes of pr- <dig>  and one of its re-isolates, pr-745# <dig>  were compared, a  <dig> -fold increase in chromosomal content was detected for several scaffolds in pr-745# <dig> . additionally, average read depths for one of the heterozygous alleles located on duplicated scaffolds were twice those of alternative alleles . note that these two independent analyses detected chromosomal alterations at the same locations and that the boundaries of the altered regions coincided completely with those of scaffolds, indicating the precision of the analyses. these observations indicate de-novo copy number change from two to three in the oak re-isolate. the sum of the duplicated scaffolds for pr-745# <dig> corresponds to nine % of the total genome.fig.  <dig> read-depth analyses revealed chromosomal aberrations in nwt isolates. large ccnvs were revealed by bic-seq analysis  and by a read-depth analysis for heterozygous allele ratios using 10 kb long non-overlapping sliding window . a concatenated view of the  <dig> largest scaffolds with a total length of 300 mb, corresponding to approximately half of the total genome of p. ramorum is shown. scaffold numbers for large ccnv regions are indicated with pink bars, and those for loh are shown with green bars. scales show log  fold difference between sample isolates and reference isolates for bic-seq analysis and log  ratios of alleles of sample isolates for the heterozygous allele frequency analysis. at each heterozygous locus, a read count ratio  was calculated. allele count ratios larger than eight were set to eight to visualize the loss of heterozygosity. for the re-isolates pr745# <dig> and pr1156#7# <dig>  corresponding progenitor isolates were used as reference for bic-seq analyses . a pr- <dig>  an example of ccnv profile for the category “normal euploid”. b

nwt oak isolate mk516a, an example of copy number neutral loh . close inspection of short segments with ccnv seen as spikes in cnloh regions  reveal the wt reference genome used for the bic-seq analysis has heterozygous indels  in these regions. loss of chromosomal segments harboring these indels in the nwt isolate mk516a resulted in spikes in the bic-seq analysis. e a re-isolate from the race tube showed a mixture of nuclei with heterogeneous ccnvs. f a nwt eu <dig> isolate p <dig> revealed extensive ccnvs and loh when wt eu <dig> isolate p <dig> was used as a reference



the current assembly of p. ramorum is comprised of  <dig>  scaffolds  <cit>  and genetic and physical linkages among the scaffolds are currently unknown. hence, the duplicated scaffolds seen along the concatenated scaffolds are most probably located on the same chromosome. given that phytophthora species usually have five to  <dig> major chromosomes  and p. ramorum is believed to be n = 10- <dig> , we estimate the duplicated regions correspond to trisomy in one or two whole chromosomes.

two isolates from naturally infected oak, pr- <dig>  and pr- <dig> , were also found to be trisomic but with a different set of scaffolds . this group is categorized as “3x ccnv”. in addition, four nwt isolates with intermediate values of chromosome copy number , indicative of mixtures of nuclei with heterogeneous ccnvs  <cit> , were identified. this group is categorized as “ccnv heterokaryon”.

in three oak isolates, large stretches of genomic regions with loss of heterozygosity  in snp loci were identified. a wt isolate  was found to have a  <dig> -fold decrease in the chromosomal content at the loh regions. these loh regions correspond to monosomy, and thus the isolate pr- <dig>  was classified as “1x ccnv”. on the other hand, in the two nwt isolates, mk516a  and pr <dig> , chromosomal copy number changes along the stretches of the loh regions were not detected. these loh regions correspond to a chromosomal aberration known as uniparental disomy or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity ; these isolates were categorized as “2x cnloh”.

a cross-examination of ccnv and snp datasets revealed a total of four chromosomal breakpoints identified as cnloh transitions in scaffolds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  a disomy to partial monosomy transition was also observed in scaffold  <dig>  and a disomy to partial trisomy transition was observed in scaffold  <dig>  all four breakpoints were found in close vicinity to tes . note that except for pr- <dig>  which was categorized as 3x ccnv as well as 2x cnloh  and had four breaks identified in its genome, the other three isolates, pr- <dig> , pr- <dig>  and mk516a had only one break identified per isolate. transcriptome analysis did not detect transcripts of tes  nor differential gene activity of tes between euploid and aneuploid isolates  at the breakpoints , implying that activity of tes and the formation of chromosomal aberrations is a transient phenomenon.fig.  <dig> chromosomal breakpoints were associated with transposable elements. of the nine na <dig> isolates carrying chromosomal aberrations, a total of seven independent chromosomal breakpoints were identified at four chromosomal locations . black vertical lines represent transposable elements visualized by integrative genomics viewer  <cit> . cyan and orange bars represent segments of homologous chromosomes. a in scaffold  <dig>  chromosomal breakpoints resulted in a partial monosomy in pr- <dig>  and a cnloh in pr- <dig>  two line retrotransposons were located at the breakpoint . b in scaffold  <dig>  the chromosomal breakpoints for the partial trisomy  and cnloh  occurred at the same genomic location. four gypsy retrotransposons were found at the breakpoint . c another breakpoint for cnloh in pr- <dig> was found in scaffold  <dig>  two gypsy retrotransposons flank the breakpoint . d the third breakpoint for cnloh in pr- <dig> was located in scaffold  <dig>  a mudr dna transposon was located at the breakpoint . additional files.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show close up of breakpoints



in summary, nwt isolates have on average a greater number of larger ccnvs than wt isolates do, demonstrating the association of nwt and ccnvs. also, involvement of tes in the generation of ccnvs was implicated.

ccnvs in p. ramorum eu <dig> lineage exposed to lawson cypress
in europe, two genetically distinct clonal lineages of p. ramorum occur, eu <dig> and eu <dig>  <cit> . eu <dig> isolates, mainly from rhododendron or viburnum spp. and from european beech , have shown a remarkably high level of stability compared to isolates of the na <dig> lineage, and normally exclusively exhibit the wt colony morphology  <cit> . furthermore > <dig> eu <dig> isolates from destructive unprecedented outbreaks on plantation larch  in the uk starting in  <dig>  <cit>  have also been described as wt. however, in  <dig>  twenty-five eu <dig> isolates obtained from the phloem of a single four meter long lesion on a mature lawson cypress  in the uk  <cit> , displayed diverse colony types. it is estimated that from the time of the original infection the pathogen was probably active in this lesion for at least three seasons. five isolates from the middle of the lesion all had the wt phenotype and remained wt in re-subculturing . seven from the top front of the lesion were initially a mixture of wt and nwt phenotypes, but all became nwt on re-subculturing . many isolation attempts from the bottom lesion front failed, and some isolates senesced before they could be subcultured, but all of the thirteen successful isolates were and remained nwt .

three representative isolates, one reference wt from the middle of the lesion and two nwt from the top and bottom lesion fronts  were subjected to ccnv analysis. large chromosomal regions with ccnvs and loh were identified in the eu <dig> nwt isolates in comparison to both the eu <dig> wt  and the na <dig> wt reference isolates . intermediate values of chromosomal copy number and the increase in snp allele ratios at heterozygous loci indicate the three isolates  were ccnv heterokaryons.

ccnvs in relation to the growth acceleration phenotype 
to obtain information on the development of ccnvs, gap, and nwt phenotype, a ccnv analysis was conducted on the isolates which had been subjected to a series of passage experiments . no major ccnvs or noticeable changes in snp allele ratios were seen in the inoculum isolate pr- <dig> , re-isolate from oak pr-1556# <dig> , or the inoculum isolate passed through the race tube, pr-1556# <dig>  . in contrast to the genome of pr- <dig> , which was stable over 18 weeks of growth in the race tube , pr-1556#7# <dig>  was found to be a ccnv heterokaryon , supporting the notion that oak but not california bay destabilizes the genome of p. ramorum.

genes in duplicated chromosomal regions are over-expressed
differential expression of genes located on the duplicated regions is expected and may be responsible for the phenotypic changes in oak isolates. global mrna profiles of trisomic isolates pr- <dig>  and pr-745# <dig>  were compared with those of the four wt normal euploid isolates . as a result,  <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed genes in pr- <dig>  and pr-745# <dig> , respectively, were identified . microarray analysis detected expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes located in duplicated regions in the first 30 mb of the concatenated scaffolds in pr- <dig> and pr-745# <dig>  respectively. genes on the duplicated regions were found more likely to be up-regulated  but not down-regulated in relation to the genome average. such overexpression of duplicated genes may be responsible for the observed phenotypic changes.

discussion
epidemiological and experimental studies support the hypothesis that oak is a dead-end for phytophthora ramorum and that propagules produced on infectious hosts such as california bay initiate infection on oak  <cit> . the fact that unusual non wild-type phenotypic variation  has been observed in oak isolates and not in california bay populations of p. ramorum  <cit>  together with the evidence that california bay populations provide the inoculum source for the oak populations suggests that: 1)- the genomic changes involved in nwt occur once the pathogen colonizes oak and that 2)- colonization of oak does not exert a similar selection pressure on the p. ramorum genome as colonization of california bay.

since the oak-nwt variation apparently occurs in the absence of any genetic differentiation in the p. ramorum population  <cit> , the concept of host-induced phenotypic diversification  was formulated. the main objective of the present study was to demonstrate hipd experimentally and gain insight into the underlying genetic mechanisms. when wild type  isolates from california bay were artificially inoculated on both oak and california bay, hipd was observed only when the pathogen was re-isolated from oak. in these tests, colony morphologies and mrna profiles of wild type  isolates converted to non-wild type  through artificial oak inoculation matched the colony morphologies and the mrna profiles of nwt isolates obtained from naturally infected oak. this is further evidence that nwt isolates are not a permanent subpopulation specialized in oak but they arise de novo inside oak from the general population. the nwt colony phenotype was not always observable among re-isolates immediately after retrieval from inoculated hosts, but did develop in re-isolates from oak during subsequent in vitro colony growth.

in the sequence analyses, nwt colony morphology was found to be strongly correlated with a range of chromosomal aberrations including aneuploidy and chromosomal number neutral loss of heterozygosity . a similar association of nwt phenotype and chromosomal aberrations was observed in the eu <dig> isolates from lawson cypress. induction of aneuploidy has been reported in several fungal pathogens in response to antifungal chemical treatments  <cit> . also, some viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens are known to modify host cell ploidy . in oomycetous pathogens, field isolates with aneuploidy have been identified in diverse species  and meiotic generation of aneuploids has also been reported  <cit> . likewise, mitotic cnloh has been detected in field isolates and intercross progeny and shown a strong association with changes in pathogenicity  <cit> . our observation of a presumed mitotic generation of aneuploidy and cnloh in oak and lawson cypress is to our knowledge the first report of aneuploidy in a defined host-pathogen interaction in nature.

the location of chromosomal breakpoints associated with the genome aberrations may provide clues to the mechanisms underlying the induced aneuploidy and loh. of the total of four identified breakpoints in na <dig>  two  were shared among multiple isolates displaying cnloh and aneuploidy. given that oak is a dead-end host for p. ramorum, with no oak-to-oak infection, the shared chromosome breakpoints must be of independent origin. evidence from other organisms indicates that formation of breakpoints is non-random and that common genetic mechanisms occur. these include breakage of chromosomes at common fragile sites under replication stress, followed by repair of the double-strand breaks via homologous recombination, resulting in partial aneuploids and cnloh . all four breakpoints in p. ramorum na <dig> were located at or near tes. this is in agreement with the observation that tes were located at the breakpoints of segmental aneuploids in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . association of tes and chromosomal breakage during mitotic divisions is also well established  <cit> . for example, ty retrotransposons have also been found near double-stranded dna breaks in mitotically dividing cells in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . this is consistent with our finding of retrotransposons near the breakpoints in p. ramorum scaffolds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

three na <dig> and three eu <dig> isolates were shown to be a mixture of euploid and aneuploid nuclei. the spatial distribution of the nuclear mixture could be structured or homogeneous . for example, if structured, some hyphae would have exclusively euploid nuclei, and other hyphae exclusively aneuploidy nuclei. if distribution is homogenous, all hyphae would have both nuclear types . because  oomycete cells are multinucleate and heterogeneous nuclei can coexist within a single cell  <cit> , and because  euploid and aneuploid hyphae can have a significant difference in growth rates  <cit> , the cultures with mixed nuclei are most likely to be heterokaryotic.

it is noteworthy that the three eu <dig> isolates from a single lesion on lawson cypress showed different ratios of euploid to aneuploid nuclei . the wt isolate p <dig> showed the least deviation from one in the ratios of heterozygous snp alleles when compared to nwt isolates p <dig> and p <dig>  therefore, p <dig> hyphae contained the least number of aneuploid nuclei. hence, it could be that a higher ratio of aneuploid to euploid nuclei in the hyphae results in the nwt phenotype. indeed, such an increase in nuclear ratio could also explain the phenomenon of latent development of nwt colony morphology in wt isolates during growth in vitro, which has been observed in both the oak and lawson cypress isolates.

some recent evidence suggests that the generation of aneuploids and loh can result in episodic selection   <cit> . for example, in the human pathogens candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans, antifungal drug resistance is conferred by duplication of chromosomes harboring genes for drug targets . a rapid generation of loh in the presence of an antifungal drug has also been observed for s. cerevisiae  <cit> . it is posited that aneuploidy generates changes in gene dosage and, therefore, creates a phenotypic variation on which selection can act  <cit> . loh can remove dominant alleles so that potentially beneficial recessive alleles can contribute to an organism’s phenotype. loh can, therefore, allow beneficial recessive alleles to escape haldane’s sieve  <cit> . present evidence indicates that in p. ramorum nwt individuals are ecologically less fit than wt individuals in that they are less pathogenic and slower growing and prone to senescence in culture . there could, however, be circumstances where phenotypes driven by host-induced aneuploidy confer survival advantages to pathogens. thus, we cannot altogether discount the possibility that the resulting phenotypic diversification may allow an introduced pathogen such as p. ramorum to adapt to a novel host or to other episodic selection conditions  <cit> .

although induced chromosomal aberration as a result of host defense is currently unknown to science, the observed nwt phenotype may be due to damage inflicted directly by the host’s defense mechanisms, such as induced or constitutive metabolites, resulting in induced chromosomal aberration . thus the colony instability, slower growth rates and lower aggressiveness of the nwt phenotype can be viewed as degenerate and at a fitness disadvantage compared to the wt form. indeed, individual oak trees infected with p. ramorum do not always die suddenly. some live for many years and in others the infection may die out  <cit> . such oak survival may be associated with the conversion of p. ramorum to slow growing nwt, allowing the host to contain it, or the pathogen may become senescent and therefore effectively eradicated, as appears to have occurred at the perimeter of the large lesion on lawson cypress.

the host factors that trigger hipd remain unknown. chronic exposure to specific chemicals in oak and lawson cypress bark may make nuclei prone to chromosomal abnormalities, whereas exposure to the chemical environment of other hosts such as california bay or rhododendron may not. the phloem of coast live oak contains a mixture of chemicals including phenolics, some of which are associated with field resistance to p. ramorum  <cit> . likewise, bark and wood of lawson cypress also contains a wide range of secondary metabolites including polyphenols and oils such as limonene that exhibit antifungal activity  <cit> . additionally, lawson cypress oil is reported to contain about 2 % camphor  <cit> . camphor has been used to induce polyploidy in the true fungi and oomycetes including phytophthora  <cit> . the 3– <dig> years that p. ramorum spent in the bark of the lawson cypress canker would have provided ample time for bark compounds to induce chromosomal abnormalities. the possible role of camphor, and other bark constituents of lawson cypress and oak in inducing nwt phenotype in p. ramorum could be tested experimentally in further race tube tests.

we have shown that high-throughput sequencing methods for ccnv and loh detection are fast, reliable, and produce high-resolution data. they should, therefore, be valuable additional tools for understanding the genetics of evolutionary processes not just in phytophthora, but in other organisms as well. the quality of genome assembly is vital to the ccnv and loh analyses. in future we suggest the resolution and sensitivity of studies on structural variations of chromosomes may be significantly improved by applying long-read sequencing and genome assembly technologies to the assembly of full-length chromosomes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the sudden oak death pathogen phytophthora ramorum is exclusively clonal, yet exhibits extensive phenotypic differences when obtained from oak. when p. ramorum isolates from the foliar host california bay were inoculated and re-isolated from canyon live oak, a large number of re-isolates displayed morphological phenotypes and mrna expression profiles only seen in cultures from naturally infected oak. major genomic alterations in oak isolates including partial aneuploidy and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity were found to be associated with the observed phenotypic diversification. comparable phenotypic changes and associated genome alterations were also found in isolates from lawson cypress in the uk. chromosomal breakpoints were found to be located at or near transposons, linking transposon de-repression caused by the chemical environment of oak to structural genomic changes.
