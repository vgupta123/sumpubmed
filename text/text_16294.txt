BACKGROUND
cultivated peanut  is one of the most important oil crops in the world. peanut seeds are composed of approximately 50 % high quality edible oil and about 30 % vegetable protein. geocarpic pod development, or the development of underground pods, distinguishes peanuts from glycine max , pisum sativa , and many other legume species. geocarpic development enables the underground pods to absorb soil nutrients and protects the fruit from damage by ground animals and extreme weather. however, seeds that developed underground are more vulnerable to be infected by soilborne pathogens, for example aspergillus flavus, and subsequent contamination with aflatoxins  <cit> .

after fertilization, the gynophore forms, and elongates in a positive geotropic manner towards the ground. the gynophore elongates continuously and the ovary, which is located at the tip of the gynophore, does not swell until the gynophore has penetrated the soil. previous studies suggested that light, mechanical stimuli, and hormones are all key factors in initiating pod swelling  <cit> . before and after gynophore soil penetration, the phytochrome protein content changes significantly  <cit> , and light is considered to be the major factor preventing peanut pod development  <cit> . after gynophore soil penetration, the endogenous ethylene and iaa content change. compared with aerial green gynophores, the underground so-called white gynophores release twice the amount of ethylene. however, the iaa content is high in the aerial gynophores and low in the swelling pod stage  <cit> . it is assumed that these physiological changes restart the development of the proembryo, and subsequently initiate the process of pod development and inhibit elongation of the gynophores  <cit> . in addition to the above three factors, gravity, calcium, and ph might also be important for the growth of the pod  <cit> .

recently, several efforts were made to investigate the mechanisms of pod formation and development at the molecular level. chen et al.  analyzed the gene expression profiles of the peanut gynophore and young pod using  <dig> sequencing. they identified two senescence-associated genes that were significantly up-regulated in the aerial gynophores and suggested that these genes may contribute to embryo abortion in aerial gynophores  <cit> . in our recent study, we constructed a transcriptome library and analyzed the overall gene expression profile in the aerial-grown green gynophore, dark-grown white gynophore, and dark-grown gynophore with small pods  using a hiseq <dig> system. we identified a global change in gene expression before and after the initiation of pod growth  <cit> . furthermore, zhu et al.  performed a comparative proteomic analysis between the peanut aerial gynophore and subterranean pods using two-dimensional electrophoresis  combined with mass spectrometry, and identified several candidate proteins related to pod swelling  <cit> . using 2-de proteomic analysis, another study identified  <dig> proteins that are differentially expressed in aerial gynophores, subterranean gynophores, and gynophores subjected to various treatments  <cit> . these results provided valuable information about proteome alteration before and after peanut pod swelling. however, due to the limited number of proteins identified, these studies fail to provide a comprehensive interpretation of the molecular mechanism underlying peanut geocarpy. to gain insight into the molecular networks underlying this unique and complex developmental process, more comprehensive proteomic profiling studies are required.

here, we report the identification of a reference proteome comprising  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique proteins from stage  <dig>  gynophores , stage  <dig>  gynophores , and stage  <dig>  gynophores  . among the identified proteins, those with ontologies related to gravity response, light and mechanical stimulus, hormone synthesis and transportation, and calcium-related proteins were prominent. this study lays the foundation for understanding the mechanisms of peanut gynophore and pod development at the protein level.fig.  <dig> gynophores of three different developmental stages used for protein extraction. two representative examples each of s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> gynophores are shown



RESULTS
protein identification and statistical analysis
to acquire a comprehensive proteome profile of pods in the early stages of development, we combined  <dig> de with nanolc-ms/ms . in total,  <dig>  peptides were analyzed, resulting in the identification of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique proteins in s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> gynophores, respectively. the relative molecular mass of these proteins ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  kda, and the false discovery rates  were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % in s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> gynophores, respectively . the distribution of coverage of protein sequences mapped by peptides is shown in fig.  <dig>  we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> specific proteins in s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> gynophores, respectively . three samples shared  <dig> common proteins . the best hit id, sequence coverage, molecular weight, corresponding protein description, and sequences of all the identified proteins are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  additional file 2: table s <dig>  additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig>  the number of peptides and number of spectra for the identified protein groups are also indicated in additional file 1: table s <dig>  additional file 2: table s <dig>  additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig>  the identified protein was defined as a reproducible protein if it was matched with at least two peptides. in total,  <dig> proteins were detected with at least two matching peptides per protein. sixteen of these proteins, such as atp synthase, heat shock proteins, and wd- <dig> repeat family proteins, were detected at least  <dig> times, suggesting that they are relatively abundant. these relatively high abundant proteins may be involved in essential functions during gynophore and pod development. many proteins were detected by a single peptide, suggesting that their abundance is low in the three samples .table  <dig> total proteins identified from gynophores of three developmental stages

protein classification and functional annotation
to investigate the diverse functions of proteins obtained from the three samples, we predicted the biological functions of the identified proteins using gene ontology  analysis . based on sequence homology,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins of s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> gynophore samples were categorized into  <dig> functional groups . in some cases, a particular protein could be classified into more than one category, suggesting that the protein has roles in multiple biological processes. proteins involved in cell, cell part, metabolic process, cellular process, organelle, binding, catalytic activity, and response to stimulus were highly represented in all three samples.fig.  <dig> histogram presentation of gene ontology classification. the identified proteins are grouped into three main categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. the right y-axis indicates the number of genes in a category. the left y-axis indicates the percentage of a specific category of genes in that main category



to further evaluate the identified proteins, we performed cluster of orthologous groups  classification analysis. among the  <dig> cog categories, the category of general function prediction only contained  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins in s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  respectively, and represented the largest group, followed by the category of posttranslational modification, energy production and conversion, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis. nuclear structure, chromatin structure and dynamics, and rna processing and modification represented the smallest groups, each containing only a few proteins .fig.  <dig> cog function classification of identified proteins. the identified proteins were classified into  <dig> categories, such as posttranslational modification, energy production and conversion, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, translation, and ribosomal structure. the y-axis indicates the number of genes in each category. the x-axis indicates the categories of proteins



to identify the biological pathways that are active in s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> gynophores, we mapped the identified proteins to the reference canonical pathways in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database  <cit> . in total,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kegg pathways were represented by proteins identified in s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> gynophores, respectively, and these pathways included metabolic pathways, plant-pathogen interaction pathways, plant hormone signal transduction pathways, and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways . these annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes and pathways associated with peanut gynophore and pod development.

proteins associated with peanut pod development
previous studies suggested that the geocarpic development of peanut pods is regulated by several factors, such as light, mechanical stimuli, hormones, and gravity. to identify homologues of proteins involved in peanut pod development, we performed a blastp search against the ncbi nr database . in total, we identified  <dig> proteins with functions closely related to the above-mentioned key factors that regulate early pod development in peanut . thirteen of these proteins were associated with hormone metabolism and transport. among these proteins, ten were involved in auxin biosynthesis, regulation, and transportation, such as auxin conjugate hydrolase, auxin-induced proteins, auxin-binding proteins, and auxin efflux carrier. one protein was involved in ethylene biosynthesis, one was related to brassinosteroid biosynthesis, and one was related to gibberellin regulation. moreover, we identified  <dig> proteins related to gravity stimulation in the peanut proteome dataset, half of which were heat shock proteins . twenty-six proteins involved in light and mechanical stimuli were identified, and half of these  were annotated as peroxidases. in addition, five calcium-related proteins, namely calmodulin  <dig>  calcium-binding protein, endoplasmic reticulum-type calcium-transporting atpase  <dig>  calcium-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase, and calcium-binding ef hand family protein, were identified .table  <dig> the identified proteins associated with early pod development in peanut

comparative analysis of the proteome and transcriptome of peanut
in our previous study, we performed a transcriptome analysis of peanut gynophores and pods , and generated a global gene expression profile that provided valuable information about the changes in gene expression that occur in s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> gynophores and during pod development  <cit> . the gene expression level was calculated by rpkm . to evaluate the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during these three stages of gynophore development, we compared the protein identification results with the gene expression data. the correlation between identified proteins and mrna expression is shown in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> identified key proteins were detected in the digital gene expression profiling results, including key proteins in hormone synthesis, response to gravity, light, mechanical stimulus, and calcium. interestingly, the corresponding gene transcription levels of some proteins that were found to be highly abundant at the protein level  were very low or undetected. examples of these include gibberellin-regulated protein , heat shock protein  <dig> , heat shock protein  <dig> , vacuolar h+-atpase b subunit , and peroxidase . by contrast, some highly expressed transcripts were not detected in the peanut proteome dataset. for example, the pdr-type abc transporter  <dig> transcript  exhibited higher expression levels in s <dig>  and s <dig>  gynophores than in s <dig> gynophores . however, pdr-type abc transporter  <dig> protein was only detected in s <dig> gynophores, suggesting the occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation of the corresponding gene.

discussion
proteomic technology is a useful approach for identifying proteins in plants . recently, a number of proteins that are differentially expressed between peanut aerial gynophores, subterranean gynophores, and early swelling pods, were identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry  <cit> . in the current study, we combined  <dig> de with nanolc ms/ms shotgun proteomic analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the proteome profile during peanut gynophores and early pod development. compared with traditional approaches, fractionation prior to lc − ms/ms analysis significantly increased the number of identified proteins and individual protein coverage  <cit> . we successfully identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins in peanut s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> gynophores, including  <dig> proteins related to the gravity response, light and mechanical stimuli, and hormone biosynthesis and transport, which are all considered to be important processes during peanut gynophore elongation and early pod development.

in contrast to other aboveground organs of peanut, the aerial gynophores grow downwards to the ground. proteins that play positive roles in geotropic growth could thus be involved in gynophore development. it was reported that the abc transporters, heat shock proteins, microtubules, and microtubule-associated proteins play important roles in the plant’s response to gravity stimulation  <cit> . we identified  <dig> proteins related to gravity stimulation in the peanut proteome dataset, half of which were heat shock proteins . light and mechanical stimuli are the key factors affecting peanut pod development . in total, we identified  <dig> proteins involved in light and mechanical stimuli in this study,  <dig> of which were annotated as peroxidases. in addition, we identified five calcium-related proteins, i.e., calmodulin  <dig>  calcium-binding protein, endoplasmic reticulum-type calcium-transporting atpase  <dig>  calcium-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase, and calcium-binding ef hand family protein .

after soil penetration, the gynophores continue to elongate for a short period of time in the darkness. however, s <dig> gynophores exhibit morphological and physiological differences from s <dig> gynophores, indicating that the expression levels of some proteins were changed. here, we detected  <dig> proteins that were specifically expressed in s <dig> gynophores. by comparing our proteomic data with our previously published rna-seq dataset  <cit> , we identified  <dig> proteins whose transcription levels were high or specifically expressed in s <dig> gynophores . for other proteins identified, the corresponding gene expression data were not in agreement with the protein accumulation patterns. we classified these  <dig> proteins into  <dig> groups according to their function. among these specific proteins in s <dig> gynophores,  <dig> proteins were annotated as cell structure-related proteins, including four members of the pectin methylesterase family, two proteins involved in polygalacturonase, one expansin, one polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein, and two villins. pectin methylesterase plays important roles in cell wall extension during pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and stem elongation  <cit> . expansins are involved in cell enlargement and can cause irreversible extension of the cell wall  <cit> , and have been linked to auxin action  <cit> . we suggest that the accumulation of pectin methylesterase and expansins promotes the elongation of s <dig> gynophores. by comparing our proteomic data with our previously published rna-seq dataset, we also found some other interesting proteins in s <dig> gynophores . for example, gdsl-motif lipase, which is associated with ethylene signaling proteins in arabidopsis  <cit> , was identified only in s <dig> gynophores. at the transcription level, the gdsl-motif lipase unigene  <dig> was strongly expressed in s <dig> gynophores , while its expression levels were much lower in s <dig>  and s <dig>  gynophores.

we identified  <dig> proteins that were specifically or strongly expressed in s <dig> gynophores . the protein accumulation pattern of  <dig> of these proteins was in agreement with their transcription level in the s <dig> gynophore . however, the accumulation trend of other proteins was not in agreement with their transcripts. function annotation and classification results showed that one-third of the proteins whose protein accumulation patterns agrees with their transcripts were enzymes involved in metabolism and secondary metabolism, such as anthocyanin-o-acyltransferase, caffeic acid o-methyltransferase, and phytase. in addition, three disease and defense-related proteins were identified, i.e., class iii peroxidase, peroxidase  <dig> precursor, and peroxidase-like protein. peroxidases are a family of isozymes found in plants, and their functions include removal of h2o <dig>  biosynthesis and degradation of lignin in cell walls, auxin catabolism, defense responses to wounding, and defense against pathogen or insect attack  <cit> . we suggest that high levels of peroxidase accumulation play essential roles in underground gynophore development. moreover, four transport-related proteins, namely amino acid/polyamine transporter ii, mate efflux family protein, pdr-type abc transporter  <dig>  and sugar transporter erd6-like  <dig>  were specifically identified in s <dig> gynophores.

compared with the rna-seq dataset  <cit> , we found that  <dig> proteins of s <dig> were highly or specifically expressed both at the protein and mrna level . seven of these were enzymes involved in metabolism and secondary metabolism, including cinnamate 4-hydroxylase . c4h is a key catalytic enzyme in the synthesis of 4-hydroxycinnamate, a component in the lignin and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways. in addition, fatty acids and starch synthesis-related proteins, such as lipoxygenase, fad-binding domain-containing protein and starch branching enzyme i, were found in s <dig> gynophores and pods, suggesting that dry matter accumulation and seed development have started at this stage. five cell growth or division and cell structure proteins were identified in early swelling pods. when the pod starts to swell, gynophore elongation ceases. the high levels of actin and microtubule-associated protein accumulation suggest that the cytoskeleton undergoes drastic change in s <dig> gynophores. the identification of specific and highly abundant proteins in s <dig> and s <dig> gynophores provided valuable information that can be used to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying geocarpic pod development.

CONCLUSIONS
our integrated analysis of proteome and transcriptome data provided useful information about the mechanism controlling gynophore and pod development . during aerial growth, the accumulation of pectin methylesterase and expansins promoted the growth and elongation of gynophores. the abc transporter, heat shock protein, microtubule-associated protein, and auxin efflux carrier identified in s <dig> gynophores could play important roles in controlling the growth direction of gynophores. after soil penetration, the new environment and soil friction induced an increase in the levels of protective proteins, such as class iii peroxidase, peroxidase  <dig> precursor, and peroxidase-like protein. alpha-expansin  <dig>  which might prompt gynophores to continue to elongate for a short period after gynophore soil penetration, was detected in the s <dig> sample. once the young pods formed in s <dig> gynophores, the levels of enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism and starch biosynthesis increased, such as lipoxygenase, fad-binding domain-containing protein, and starch branching enzyme i. furthermore, actin-related proteins accumulated during early pod development. interestingly, we observed that the nodulin gene and the corresponding protein were both strongly expressed during early pod initiation, suggesting that nodulation and early pod development might share similar mechanisms. our proteome profiling results presented here provide useful insight into the mechanisms controlling peanut pod development.fig.  <dig> identified proteins and their suggested function in peanut gynophores and during early pod development. pectin methylesterases and expansins induced the aerial gynophores to grow and elongate. the abc transporter, heat shock protein, microtubule-associated protein, and auxin efflux carrier controlled the direction of gynophore growth. after soil penetration, the new environment and soil friction induced an increase of protective proteins, such as class iii peroxidase, peroxidase  <dig> precursor, and peroxidase-like protein. furthermore, alpha-expansin  <dig> might prompt the gynophores to continue to elongate until the gynophores started to swell. after young pods formed, enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism and starch synthesis, such as lipoxygenase, fad-binding domain-containing protein, and starch branching enzyme i, were activated. meanwhile, the expression of actin-related proteins may reflect the pod development
