BACKGROUND
the medial and lateral compartments of the alar plate of the metencephalon have been shown to confer distinct patterning information during neurogenesis and gliogenesis of the embryonic cerebellum  . whereas cerebellar inhibitory neurons like purkinje cells  and bergmann glial cells are generated in the medial portion of the fourth ventricle   <cit> , primary precursors of granule neurons  are produced from its lateral recesses, the so-called cerebellar rhombic lip   <cit> . during the third week of gestation in the mouse, radial glial cells of the medial aspect of the ventricular zone  progressively retract their somata towards the cortex and actively divide to generate precursors of bergmann glial cells and astrocytes  <cit> . at the same time, young pcs migrate radially from the neuroepithelium to the surface in a strictly caudal-to-rostral order, paralleling the emergence of cohorts of neuron precursors from the rl and their superficial migration along the dorsal surface of the cb primordium  <cit> .

using a line of transgenic mice in which tamoxifen-inducible cre expression at the time of birth results in permanent Î²-galactosidase labeling, rl precursors destined to populate the internal granule layer  were estimated to be generated in a rostral-to-caudal sequence between e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> . at the time, these lac-z-labelled igl cells were thought to represent a homogenous population of granule neurons. a recent study has provided evidence that besides granule cells, the cerebellar rl gives birth to another igl population of neurons, unipolar brush cells , between e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, granule and ubc neurons are preceded by glutamatergic deep cerebellar nuclei  neurons. the first dcn neuron precursors are born in the rl at around e <dig>  at e <dig> , they stream over the entire dorsal surface of the cb, and from e <dig>  until e <dig>  they aggregate in the ntz, a transient zone of differentiation  <cit> .

the rl therefore appears to be highly dynamic, giving rise to distinct neuronal populations, and a consensus has now emerged from all these fate-mapping studies, which redefines the rl as a functional rather than anatomical entity. the rl is now considered as a territory within rhombomere  <dig> which is required for the sequential generation of all cerebellar and extracerebellar superficial migratory streams, therefore contributing neurons to the proprioceptive/vestibular/auditory sensory network which task is to sense the organism's position in space  <cit> . the cells of this functional system all depend on the expression of the basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor math1for their genesis  <cit> , and the paired and homeodomain containing transcription factor pax <dig> for their proper migration  <cit> .

in s100b-egfp mice, we had previously noted that the transgene is activated during histogenesis of the cb between e <dig>  and p <dig>  and reported the existence of a large population of s100b+ cells in the cb cortex of newborn mice  <cit> . because s100b is commonly used as a marker of bergmann glia and white matter astrocytes in the cb of adult mice  <cit> , we assumed that its presence in the embryonic cb marked their precursors. s100b is a small ef-hand calcium and zinc binding protein, highly expressed in the adult vertebrate central nervous system  along with five other s <dig> family members  <cit> . the s100b protein sequence is extremely well conserved  among mammals, suggesting that it is endowed with important physiological functions  <cit> . however, as judged by the vitality of mice strains lacking the s100b protein, there must be a fundamental resiliency of the developmental program involving the s100b protein  <cit> .

s100b is a highly soluble protein implicated in the initiation and maintenance of a pathological, glial-mediated pro-inflammatory state, and its presence in biological fluids is a well-established biomarker for severity of neurological injury and prognosis for recovery  <cit> . a consensus sequence for s100b target proteins was published as xwxxil and matches a region in the actin capping protein capz  <cit> . several additional s100b targets are known, including p <dig> <cit> , two ndr kinases  <cit> , the rage receptor  <cit> , protein kinase c, and gap- <dig>  <cit> . the range of effector proteins so far identified suggests roles in the regulation of transcription, cell-cycle progression  <cit> , and cell morphology. in astrocytes where s100b is abundantly expressed, its best-characterized roles involve modulating protein-protein interactions of all three classes of cytoskeletal structures, and preventing these interactions blocks astrocyte stellation  <cit> .

with the present study, we sought to determine the precise spatio-temporal pattern of s100b expression in the embryonic cb using the s100b-egfp mouse as a model. we found that s100b protein expression in radial glial cells of the medial portion of the cerebellar vz marks the onset of gliogenesis. in addition, we provide evidence for transcriptional activation of the endogenous s100b gene being associated with the prenatal phase of gp production in the rl.

RESULTS
s100b expression in the cerebellum 
the observation that incited us to launch the present study is illustrated in figure  <dig>  at around e <dig> , and compared to other regions of the brain, a relatively high level of the s100b-egfp reporter protein was found in the cb primordium , and this was matched by a fair level of s100b protein expression in densely packed radial glial cells located at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary  or bordering the fourth ventricle , in isolated cells of the cortical transitory zone , and to a lesser extent in the rl . unlike egfp, both nuclear and cytoplasmic, the s100b signal was often restricted to the cytoplasm but specificity was inferred from the total absence of s100b immunosignal in corresponding sections obtained from s100b null embryos .

between e <dig>  and e <dig> , migratory purkinje progenitors are subject to "contact guidance", a process by which they adhere to radial glial processes to reach their final destination in the cortex  <cit> . from e <dig>  until p <dig>  bergmann glial cells are thought to derive from primary radial glial cells that translocate their somata from the vz into the purkinje cell layer, giving rise to a secondary radial glial scaffold  <cit> . detection of s100b in the cerebellar radial glial scaffold at e <dig>  therefore incited us to go back in time and determine exactly when, and in which cell type, transcription of the s100b gene is activated in the embryonic cb.

s100b expression in the cerebellar radial glial scaffold 
compared to e <dig> , the number of egfp+ vz cells co-expressing s100b was much reduced at e <dig> , except in the narrow strip of cells located at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary . to better understand the 3-dimentional structure of this region, we examined coronal sections as well and found that egfp expression was prominent in a medial stretch of ventral neuroepithelium of approximate width  <dig> microns that belongs to the inferior tectal neuroepithelium, and not to the cb as originally thought . in the cb, the number of egfp+ cells was strikingly increased near the midline and organized in an s-shaped intensely egfp+ radial glial scaffold spanning the primordium from the vz to the pial surface . the scaffold could only be visualized in its integrity in paramedian sections .

together these results indicated that before midline fusion of the cb plates, egfp and s100b were co expressed in the sox9+ blbp+ primary radial glial scaffold traversing the cb primordium from the ic posterior limit to the rl, with a higher level of expression near the midline. in addition, egfp;s100b co-expression was prominent in a median stretch of inferior tectal neuroepithelium directly abutting the rostral cb primordium.

characterization of the s100b-egfp cell population of the ctz 
in the mouse, all cerebellar pcs are produced during only three embryonic days from e <dig>  to e <dig>   <cit> , and most, if not all glial precursors in the cb take the form of radial glial cells from e <dig>  to e <dig> , during the phase of pc migration  <cit> . using an antibody directed against calbindin- <dig> , which starts being expressed in post-mitotic pcs  <cit> , we found no colocalisation of calbindin and egfp from e <dig>  until e <dig>  . beginning on e <dig> , egfp expression was restricted to the single cell layer of radial glia bordering v <dig>  whereas calbindin+ pcs were distributed in a broad cellular cortical zone of the future hemisphere . some pcs located near the vz were closely apposed to egfp+ radial processes , which is a characteristic feature of migrating progenitors. the number of egfp+ cells was greatly increased at e <dig>  but egfp and calbindin were never co-expressed in the same cells .

based on the evenly distribution and morphology of egfp+ cells connected to the pial surface via their apical radial process , which characterize prospective bergmann glial cells  <cit> , we conclude that the radial glia-derived egfp+ population present in the cb primordium between e <dig>  and e <dig>  likely contains glial precursors some of which are already contributing to the secondary bergmann radial glial scaffold that will later be used by gps to migrate from the egl to the igl.

characterization of the s100b-egfp cell population of the rl 
before e <dig> , egfp expression was not detected in the rl , or any other territory of the cns. beginning on e <dig> , egfp expression was detected in a subpopulation of bipolar cells present in the rl  and emitting subpial branching processes into the nascent egl . however, in contrast to cells present in the medial portion of the cerebellar vz, blbp expression was much reduced and expression of the transgene was not matched by detection of the s100b protein . with some exceptions  <cit> , it is now generally accepted that the rl generates exclusively neuronal precursors. precursors of dcn glutamatergic projection neurons are born in the prospective rl and migrate into the future egl before gathering in the ntz between e <dig> and e <dig>   <cit> , whereas the first cerebellar gps and ubcs are born during the last gestational week beginning on e <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we assumed that egfp expression in the rl beginning on e <dig>  could reflect activation of the s100b gene in gp or  ubc precursors, but not in dcn precursors.

the non dcn nature of egfp+ rl precursors was tested by performing immunohistochemistry with a pair of antibodies directed against the transcription factor pax <dig> expressed in the rl throughout its neurogenetic interval  <cit> , and the transcription factor olig <dig> known to label the ntz starting on e <dig>   <cit> . the high proportion of egfp+ pax6+ double positives present in the lateral portion of the rl at e <dig>  is illustrated in figures 6b and 6c . their non-dcn nature was inferred from the discontinuity that existed at e <dig> , between the ntz already filled with olig2+ nuclei and the territory of egfp expression restricted to the rl and posterior egl .

until e <dig>  , a high level of egfp expression was maintained in a subpopulation of pax6+ precursors present in the rl and in the egl, whereas from e <dig>   onwards , egfp expression was down-regulated in the egl, and the number of egfp+ cells present in the rl decreased considerably in proportion to the growth of the egl. during that time, expression of the transgene was not matched by a significant s100b signal . however, the possibility that the transgene could be ectopically expressed was discredited once we realized that s100b mrna had previously been detected in that region  <cit>  .

from our results and the results provided by a recent study that will be discussed below  <cit> , we believe that transient expression of the s100b-egfp transgene is a specific marker of the primary phase of gp genesis in the embryonic rl.

discussions and 
CONCLUSIONS
the aim of the present study was to establish the spatio-temporal pattern of s100b expression in the mouse embryonic cb. we compared the distribution of the s100b-egfp reporter to that of the endogenous s100b protein from e <dig>  to e <dig> . our results establish the s100b protein as a marker of the blbp+ sox9+ primary radial glial scaffold starting on e <dig> . in addition, and although the s100b protein was not detected, we provide evidence that s100b-egfp expression in pax6+ derivatives of the rl marked the onset of primary gp production. in addition, our results suggest that depending on the site of s100b synthesis, primary radial glial scaffold and derivatives or rl and neuron precursors, s100b may be retained within the cell or secreted.

the onset of s100b expression in the cerebellar ventricular zone: marking the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in primary radial glial cells
although we found no mention of the s100b protein being expressed in the mouse embryonic cerebellar radial glia, the s100b mrna was detected in the rat cerebellar radial glia  <cit> . additionally, in a study designed to analyze the expression pattern of  <dig> murine orthologs of genes identified on human chromosome  <dig>  the s100b mrna was detected in the vz of the mouse embryonic cb on whole mounts and tissue sections  <cit> .

the radial glial origin of egfp+ s100b+ cells present in the ctz in increasing number from e <dig> to e <dig>  is also consistent with several reports showing that in addition to being essential for pc exit from the vz between e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> , the primary radial glia is linked to gliogenesis from e <dig> to p <dig>  <cit> . according to 3h thymidine and brdu birth dating studies, pcs are produced between e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> , and expression of calbindin- <dig> is first detectable at around e <dig> in post mitotic pcs that have migrated a short distance away from the vz  <cit> .

here we show that egfp+ cells that detach from the vz and migrate into the ctz beginning on e <dig> , are not post-mitotic purkinje cells. while migrating towards the surface most egfp+ cells lose their connection to the vz but not their connection to the pial membrane, a feature of prospective bergmann glial cells. finally, we show that near the onset of gliogenesis , sox <dig> expression is maintained in some radial glia-derived egfp+ cells. this is in line with a previous report showing that most, if not all glial precursors in the cb take the form of radial glial cells  <cit>  and bergmann glial cells maintain sox <dig> expression from the early migrating progenitor stage through adulthood  <cit> .

several molecules known to be expressed in bergmann glial cells of the adult mouse cb start being expressed in the embryonic radial glia, at around e <dig>  they include the intermediate filament protein vimentin  <cit> , the lipid binding protein blbp  <cit> , the enzyme glutamine synthetase  <cit> , the extra cellular matrix molecule with neuron-glia cell adhesion activity tenascin-c  <cit> , the glutamate transporter glast  <cit> , the enzyme 3pgdh involved in l-serine biosynthesis  <cit> , the punc neural cell-adhesion molecule  <cit> , and the transcription factor sox <dig>  <cit> . we now suggest that s100b be added to the list.

the midbrain-hindbrain junction: a privileged site of s100b expression before cerebellar midline fusion
the strongly s100b+ median stretch of ventral neuroepithelium we observed at the midbrain-hindbrain junction  is reminiscent of a previously reported vimentin+ radial glial structure linking the ic to the cb in e <dig> rat embryos  <cit> . in the mouse, this isthmic territory is thought to provide a cellular substratum and the signals essential for fusion of the cerebellar plates along the dorsal midline  <cit> . in addition, this territory is subsequently relinquished to the velum medullaris, a neuron-free sheet of cells that is very short before birth but which develops during the following days and links the anterior pole of the vermis to the inferior colliculus.

s100b: a rhombic lip marker of primary granule precursor genesis
the rl is a specialized germinative epithelium that arises as a result of the ongoing interaction between the neural tube and the non-neural roof plate ectoderm of v <dig> . its main derivatives include primary precursors of glutamate releasing excitatory granule neurons, by far the most numerous neurons in the cns, which relay afferent, excitatory information from mossy fibers to purkinje neurons. in addition, the rl produces precursors of dcn neurons, the main output centers of the cb  <cit> , and cortical ubcs, which amplify inputs from vestibular ganglia and nuclei  <cit> .

in the present study, we provide evidence for transcription of the s100b gene being specifically activated in the rl during the primary phase  of gp genesis. first, we have shown that expression of the s100b-egfp transgene is initiated in pax6+ precursors present in the rl at e <dig> , which is after the bulk of dcn neuron precursors have left the rl  <cit>  and reached the ntz  <cit> . the non-dcn nature of the rl pax6+ precursors is substantiated by the existence of a clear boundary, at e <dig> , between the egfp-tagged rl and the egfp-negative ntz . such a discontinuity is not expected to occur when using a lacz reporter gene driven by the math <dig> locus  <cit> .

second, we think we can exclude ubc precursors as possible candidates for s100b-egfp expression on the basis of their mode of migration that is different from the subpial mode of pax6+ egfp+ precursor migration within the egl. both populations of gps and ubc precursors are known to share expression of the rl markers pax <dig> and math <dig>  however, unlike ubc precursors which stream from the rl and posterior egl into the developing white matter, and are therefore excluded from the anterior egl  <cit> , egfp+ pax6+ precursors invested the entire egl with their leading process contacting the pial surface , a signature of migrating gps  <cit> . hence, we believe that transient expression of the s100b gene is a specific marker of the primary phase of gp genesis in the embryonic rl.

finally, although we could not detect the s100b protein in the mouse rl, evidence exists for the presence of the s100b protein in the hamster egl  <cit> , and s100b mrna in the murine cerebellar vz including the rl  <cit> . therefore, one interpretation for our results is that both the endogenous s100b gene and the transgene are expressed in the rl but the s100b protein cannot be detected because its cytoplasmic level is below detection limit, or because it is released in the intercellular space. the latter cannot be expected from the reporter egfp protein since it is not a fusion of s100b and egfp  <cit> .

how is the s100b gene activated during cerebellar morphogenesis?
before cerebellar midline fusion, the medial-most portion of the cb neuroepithelium and abutting inferior tectal neuroepithelium, both co expressing egfp and s100b at the highest level , are also known territories of high en- <dig> expression  <cit> . this designates en- <dig> as a potential inducer of s100b gene expression in the cb. beginning on e <dig>  in the mouse, the fgf- <dig> molecule produced in the isthmic orgnizer  <cit>  induces expression of a series of genes including wnt- <dig> and en- <dig>  <cit> . wnt- <dig> maintains en- <dig> expression, which in turn, positively regulates fgf- <dig>  resulting in amplification of the fgf- <dig> signal necessary for proper cb specification and development  <cit> .

interestingly, the earliest site of strong s100bexpression in s100b-egfp mice is the notochord beginning on e <dig>  , and inhibition of en- <dig> expression by antisense targeting of early somite mouse embryos resulted in the loss of s100b expression in the notochord region subjacent to affected neural tube segments  <cit> . therefore, s100b may be a downstream component of the wnt/en- <dig> regulatory cascade involved in the specification of both the notochord and cb.

which function for s100b during cerebellar morphogenesis?
in the mouse embryonic cb, radial glial cells and immature astrocytes express the intermediate filament vimentin  <cit> , a protein with which s100b was shown to interact in vitro  <cit> . s100b also binds to and activates in a ca2+-dependent manner ndr- <dig> and ndr- <dig>  two nuclear proteins that belong to an evolutionary conserved subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases involved in the regulation of cell morphology  <cit> . these types of interaction are consistent with s100b participating in vivo in the establishment and maintenance of a radial glial phenotype in the medial portion of the cb where s100b is intracytoplasmic.

s100b may also be released from cerebellar rhombic lip egfp+ pax6+ precursors and promote the extension and branching of their neurites as illustrated in fig. 6c. in  <dig>  kligman and marshak identified the extra cellular disulfide form of s100b as the molecule responsible for neurite extension of cultured chicken embryonic cortical neurons and named it "neurite extension factor"  <cit> . this nef effect of s100b was later demonstrated on various types of neurons including cortical neurons  <cit> , serotonergic mesencephalic neurons  <cit> , dorsal root ganglion neurons  <cit>  and spinal cord neurons  <cit> , but the mechanism responsible for the nef effect is unknown.

another possible role exerted by the s100b protein released in the extracellular space is that of a trophic factor. added in ovo at physiological concentrations, s100b was indeed capable of preventing the naturally occurring death of chicken motor neurons  <cit> . the neurotrophic activity of s100b is thought to involve activation of nf-kappab  <cit> , binding to the receptor for advanced glycation end products  and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  <cit> .
