BACKGROUND
antimicrobial veterinary medicinal product  use in livestock is one of the main factors contributing to selection and spread of resistant microorganisms, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing microorganisms   <cit> . the animals and their environment form a reservoir for the transmission of resistant pathogens to other animals and potentially to humans . to minimize selection and spread of antimicrobial resistance both at national and international levels, the antimicrobial burden needs to be reduced  <cit>  and more prudent use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine is necessary.

some european countries have implemented a national system for monitoring antimicrobial consumption by humans and animals and publish the results in national reports, such as nethmap  <cit> , maran  <cit>  and the sda report  <cit>  in the netherlands. sales data are used to monitor veterinary antimicrobial use, but some national monitoring systems also use animal defined daily dosages as their unit of measurement. the european medicines agency reports sales data of veterinary antimicrobials per country through the european surveillance of veterinary antimicrobial consumption  project  <cit> . a working party of the esvac aims to specify the reports for example by stratifying sales of specific avmps to animal  categories  <cit>  and to establish internationally harmonized animal defined daily dosages, comparable to the units used in the netherlands and denmark  <cit>  in order to enable cross country comparison. in human medicine internationally harmonized defined daily dosages  per active ingredient are established by the who  <cit> . ddds are established for the main indication for which the active ingredient is applied and corrects for differences in dosing between various active ingredients for the same indication . because ddds are internationally applied in reporting medicine use, the results in these reports are suitable for direct international comparison. animal defined daily doses, however, are currently only established at a national level. the principle of the animal defined daily dosage is to establish a standard dose per product, per animal species, per day to correct for differences in dosing between antimicrobials and animal species. therefore, the principle of this unit of measurement for monitoring of antimicrobial consumption is the same in the different countries where it is applied. however, due to national product availability, legal considerations such as differences in authorized indications and dosages  differences in animal defined daily dosages applied in different countries can be expected. this lack of uniformity complicates international comparison of the results from national veterinary antimicrobial drug consumption monitoring programs.

postma et al.  <cit>  recently presented a concept for establishing internationally harmonized animal defined daily dosages, based on the national authorization documents of individual avmps in multiple countries, and described the benefits and limitations of this method. a comparison and review of possible differences between nationally established animal defined daily dosages, however, has not yet been performed. the objective of this study was to compare the animal defined daily dosages applied  in national veterinary antimicrobial drug consumption monitoring programmes of two countries, to determine whether there are differences and, if differences exist, to analyse the magnitude of these differences. we did this by reviewing the consequences on the outcome on antimicrobial consumption when different animal defined daily dosages were applied to the same dataset of antimicrobial drug deliveries to dutch pig farms.

methods
animal defined daily dosages
the defined daily dose animal  is the unit of measurement for the determination of annual veterinary antimicrobial drug consumption. in the netherlands, ddda’s are derived from dutch avmp authorization documents and we will refer to this parameter as the dddanl. the dddanl is established per avmp and species and represents the amount of avmp  needed for the treatment of one kg of animal for one day in accordance to the mean authorized dosage for the target animal. the dddanl for avmps with a prolonged duration of action  or a shorter duration of action  are corrected for this by a correction factor either retrieved from the authorization documents or based on expert consensus within the sda. full details on dddanl definition as well as data collection, exact contents of datasets, and calculation of the total veterinary antimicrobial consumption in livestock were published previously  <cit> .

a comparable parameter for calculation of annual antimicrobial drug consumption is referred to as animal daily dose . the adddk is the assumed average maintenance dose needed to treat one kg of animal during one day for the main indication in the target species in accordance with the danish authorization document of the specific avmp  <cit> . the adddk was applied as the unit of measurement in danmap 2009– <dig>  in the provided data for this study the adddk was expressed as the amount of an avmp  needed per kg animal per day.

the third applied animal defined daily dosages are the defined animal daily dose  as reported since danmap  <dig>  <cit> . the dadddk is specified per animal species and is a standardized dose in mg/kg per day for the main indication of a given active ingredient and a specified route of administration and pharmaceutical form. for orally administered antimicrobials, a differentiation is made between types of formulations, for example premixed feed or soluble powder for drinking water medication. for some parenterally administered active compounds a differentiation is made between immediate release preparations and those with prolonged effect  <cit> . thus, the dadddk is a measure established at the level of the active ingredient, route of administration and pharmaceutical form and not at the level of a specific avmp, which are the main differences between the establishment of this unit of measurement and the adddk and dddanl.

data collection
data on deliveries of avmps to individual farms for the complete dutch pig sector from the year  <dig> were collected by the quality assurance organisations of the dutch pig sector, and provided to the netherlands veterinary medicines authority  for the monitoring of antimicrobial consumption in livestock. numbers of animals per farm specified by subcategory  and farm types  were incorporated in this dataset. farms that used a closed system housing both sows/piglets and finisher pigs were divided in a sows/piglet farm and a finisher pigs farm. individual farms were recognizable by an unique number but the encryption key was not available to the researchers, ensuring anonymous analysis of the data.

the sda provided the database with the dddanl per avmp originally used to process the dutch pig data of  <dig> . a recent list of dddanl is publicly available on the sda website  <cit> . the danish adddk used in this study were provided by the danish ministry of food, agriculture and fisheries. the dadddk per active compound defined for pigs was retrieved from the dadd description annex of danmap  <dig>  <cit>  and entered manually into a worksheet.

data analysis
all different avmps, identifiable by european article number , delivered to pig farms in the netherlands in  <dig> were derived from the dataset provided by the sda. using the adddk list from the danish ministry of food, agriculture and fisheries, danish equivalent products were selected for each dutch product. the criteria used in the selection process are shown in fig.  <dig>  for some products no danish equivalent could be established, as no products with certain combinations of active compounds or with a certain administration route are authorized in denmark. following assessment of the impact of deletion of these records on the number of dddanl/y, the delivery records for these products were excluded from all analyses.fig.  <dig> diagram showing the selection criteria of danish equivalent products for the dutch avmps. *if the adddk of a product with a different concentration correlates better with the dddanl then this product is selected instead of the product with a matching concentration of active compound . **if more than one product is eligible the product with an adddk closest to the dddanl is selected



since  <dig> the sda reports the veterinary antimicrobial consumption in livestock as defined daily dosages animal per year on national level, expressed in this study as the number of dddanl/y . the total amount of packages including package size  delivered per year per farm type/animal category  and the mean numbers of animals at risk per farm type per day were derived from the data provided by the sda. the standardized animal weights were established by the sda together with representatives from the dutch pig sector. the standardized animal weights applied in all analyses in this study are: sows/piglets  <dig>  kg  +  <dig>  piglets  +  <dig>  gilts ) and finisher pigs 70 kg.

using the dddanl, the delivery records and the package size using the ean-code, the total amount of kilograms of target animal that can be treated for one day per package of avmp can be determined. this amount is referred to as amount of treatable kilograms*days. the total amount of treatable kg*days were calculated per animal  category . by dividing this amount with the standardized animal weight for the animal category, the total treatable number of animals*days based on the deliveries was calculated. the number of dddanl/y was then calculated per farm type by dividing the total amount of treatable animals*days by the total of animals at risk per day per farm type. the same process was repeated to calculate the number of adddk/y and number of dadddk/y.

differences between the animal defined daily dosages dddanl, adddk and dadddk as units of measurement were analysed on a more detailed level by determining the total amounts of treatment days per therapeutic group of avmps . sows/piglet farms and finisher pigs farm were analysed separately.

all analyses were performed using sas® software version  <dig>  .

RESULTS
the complete dutch dataset with deliveries of avmps to pig farms in  <dig> contained  <dig> deliveries to a total of  <dig> pig farms  <dig> of which were breeding farms with sows/piglets and  <dig> were farms with finisher pigs. following the algorithm as displayed in fig.  <dig>  a total of  <dig> deliveries in  <dig> farms were excluded from the dataset  because there was no danish equivalent to match the dutch product. for the sows/piglet farms two farms were excluded from the dataset  after exclusion of these delivery records, for finisher pigs  <dig> farms were excluded . of the  <dig> excluded records,  <dig> records  were combinations of amoxicillin/colistin, and neomycin/procainbenzylpenicillin, which are combinations of antimicrobials not authorized in denmark, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole injections .

discussion
in this study we show that application of different nationally established animal defined daily dosages to the same set of antimicrobial delivery data, using the same animal  categories and standardized weight for all analyses, results in substantial differences in the reported overall outcomes on veterinary antimicrobial consumption in pigs. differences on the outcome were observed at the level of therapeutic groups of avmps. both increases and decreases were observed in treatable kilograms of animals with the application of one set of nationally defined animal daily dosages compared to another.

differences in several parts of the national process of establishing a defined animal daily dosage can be identified as responsible for the observed differences. one of these factors is the application of a correction factor to the ddda of long-acting formulations. as mentioned before, the dddanl is corrected for prolonged duration of action. for products administered once daily the correction in dddanl is factor  <dig> . however, the duration of action of the long-acting avmps exceed this 24 h and are therefore corrected by a factor exceeding  <dig> . in the adddk and dadddk the daily dosage of the avmp  or active ingredient  was reduced compared to the registered dose to correct for the duration of action. for example, for some long-acting parenteral avmp’s with oxytetracycline, a correction factor of  <dig>  is applied to the dddanl  * 100)) *  <dig>  =  <dig> treatable kilograms*days). the adddk is  <dig>  ml  parenteral oxytetracycline  but without correction factors and thus one package of 100 ml of this product provides *100 =  <dig> treatable kilograms*days. use of long-acting products can therefore theoretically have a substantial influence on the outcome of antimicrobial consumption, especially in sub-analysis or specific  categories of animals/farms. unfortunately, the duration of action is not always specified by the manufacturer or deducible from pharmacokinetic studies. therefore the applied correction factors are mostly based on consensus by national experts and differences are therefore inevitable. postma et al.  <cit>  also describe the lack of information as a problem when establishing dddas for long-acting products and the results from this study support this view.

secondly, there is a difference in establishing the adddk, dadddk or dddanl for products with multiple authorized indications and dosages as briefly mentioned in the materials and methods section. the adddk and dadddk are established by the dosage for the main indication  for which the avmp or active compound is authorized. for example the main indication of a valnemulin containing product has a dosage of 3–4 mg/kg per day, so the adddk is defined at  <dig>  mg/kg. the dddanl is always established as the mean of the authorized dosages for all authorized indications for the target animal, ranging from 1– <dig>  mg/kg to 10–12 mg/kg and therefore is established at 6 mg/kg per day.. the reason for not establishing the dddanl on the main indication, is that the indication for which an avmp is used on a farm is not part of the delivery data provided to the sda by the animal sectors. therefore the main indication of an avmp can only be guessed or assumed, but there are no data to confirm it.

thirdly, combination products are not always available in all countries, a problem also encountered in this study. excluding these products from the analysis, as was done in this study, is one option. however, that is only possible when these products account for only a small part of the total antimicrobial consumption. handling the combination products as two  separate compounds  may also lead to over- or underestimation of antimicrobial consumption. depending on the compound authorized dosages differ between combination therapy with multiple antimicrobials and monotherapy with the separate compounds.

the impact of the differences mentioned above on the outcome were illustrated by an analysis of antimicrobial use per therapeutic group. we showed that for sows/piglets farms there was a reduction in number of dadddk/y compared to number of dddanl/y for the group of macrolides/lincosamides. the same calculations however increased the number of dadddk/y to the number of dddanl/y proportion for the finisher pigs. this indicates deliveries of very specific  avmps for sows/piglets compared to the finisher pigs. therefore we performed the analysis on ean-code  where we found the main compound prescribed for sows/piglets farms was injectable tulathromycin  compared to oral tylosin in finisher pigs . the difference in proportions of number of dadddk/y to number of dddanl/y between the two categories of animals can be explained  by the fact that a correction factor is applied to the dddanl of tulathromycin due to the long duration of action of this compound . the dadddk is also corrected for this , but the factor applied differs from the dutch factor. the use of tulathromycin thus results in a higher dddanl/y than dadddk/y.

for tylosin the daily dosage is higher in the netherlands than in denmark, resulting in a lower number of dddanl/y compared to the number of dadddk/y. this finding is also in line with the study of postma et al.  <cit>  as they found an international 10- fold difference between minimum and maximum recommended dosages for tylosin for feed/water medication, which would almost certainly be reflected in a national ddda if the studied countries had established those.

apart from the differences between the units of measurement in the national veterinary antimicrobial monitoring programs as reviewed in this study there are other factors in those monitoring systems that complicate international comparison of veterinary antimicrobial use. firstly, there are differences in the definition of animal  categories and secondly the differences in standardized weights. in the dutch data no differentiation in antimicrobial deliveries to sows or  piglets can be made. therefore, sows and piglets are analysed as one category with a standardized combined weight of  <dig>  kg/sow. in denmark sows do include suckling piglets but weaned piglets are a separate category and sows and weaned piglets have their own yellow card category  <cit> . also, the standardized weight for a finisher pig in vetstat  is 50 kg  <cit>  while the sda uses a standardized weight of 70 kg for this category of animals. in this study the standardized weights of  <dig>  kg and 70 kg were used in all analysis to avoid this problem, but when directly comparing results from national antimicrobial consumption reports this fact should be considered.

also the level on which the antimicrobial consumption is calculated in the national monitoring has to be considered in comparisons. the differences between a national level calculation, where the mean use is weighted according to farm size, and a per farm analysis where all farms are of equal weight can be substantial. in the netherlands the number of dddanl/y is established both at national level and farm level . the mean of the number of dddaf/y, however, is lower than the number of dddanl/y  which indicates a higher use on large farms compared to small farms, at least within the pig sector. the calculation level  should therefore be verified before attempting across-country comparisons, at least when including data from the netherlands.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed interesting differences in outcomes on antimicrobial consumption in pigs following the use of different animal defined daily dosages. differences in outcomes on the use of avmps in an animal species can be attributed to the applied animal defined daily dosage due to differences in authorized indications and dosages, but can also be a result of differences in prescription patterns between farm types at the level of therapeutic groups or even specific avmps within those groups, next to the differences in animal  categories and standardized animal weights.

this study underlines the urgent need for international harmonized units of measurement applicable in monitoring systems for antimicrobial use in livestock, such as generic animal defined daily dosages. but also harmonized animal  categories and standardized animal weights for all animal species included in monitoring programs should be established, as proposed by the esvac.
