BACKGROUND
salmonella in swedish food producing animals is rare, due mainly to vigorous salmonella control program  initiated in the 1960s. the strategy of this program is to monitor the presence of salmonella at all stages in the " farm to fork" production chain, and to intervene whenever salmonella is found. in the swedish salmonella control at slaughter, the data for salmonella positive samples in  <dig> were:  <dig> % for cattle,  <dig> % for pigs and  <dig> % for poultry  <cit> .

in  <dig>  however, the largest out-break of salmonella in swedish animal production hitherto was reported  <cit> , a routine pig faecal sample in the control program run by the industry tested positive for s. cubana. trace-back investigation revealed that provender purchased by the farm concerned, was contaminated with s. cubana. a feed factory had supplied provender to several farms, mainly pig producers, but also several cattle farms. altogether,  <dig> farms were identified as having either salmonella-positive pigs and/or contaminated feed. however, no human cases of s. cubana were reported, nor did any samples of food origin prove positive for s. cubana during that year. in all, only  <dig> % of tested food samples were salmonella positive in  <dig> 

in the investigation following the "salmonella cubana outbreak", time was identified as a crucial factor in cost reduction, and rapid methods for the detection of salmonella were urgently sought. for the scp in sweden, the stipulated method to be used is nmkl <dig>  <cit> . when using this protocol the first indication as to whether a sample is positive or negative is obtained on day  <dig> . assumed positive samples must be confirmed, and a final result is determined after  <dig> to  <dig> additional days. in addition to the scp, many swedish companies perform their own haccp-based salmonella surveillance, and in such cases, any validated salmonella detection method may be used.

in  <dig>  the swedish board of agriculture decided that a study should be conducted to evaluate alternative rapid methods for salmonella detection that could be candidates to replace nmkl <dig> in critical investigations concerning farm animals, especially for faecal samples, where the choice of method may be suspected to appreciably influence the test results. such methods could be elisa-based and pcr-based techniques.

a number of procedures were initially considered for inclusion in the study, but for various reasons some were rejected, or were excluded at some stage of the investigation. the procedures presented here are: two culture-based methods, nmkl <dig> and draft amendment iso 6579:2002/amendeddamd  <dig>  three commercially available elisa methods  and one commercially available pcr method . in addition, culturing from the enrichment broths of the bioline optima and the bioline selecta systems was performed, and finally a non-commercial pcr method was used to evaluate the possibility of performing pcr analysis after different stages of pre-enrichment or selective enrichment. furthermore, for spiked faecal cattle samples an additional culture- based method  was evaluated.

the eu's reference laboratory for salmonella  has organized comprehensive inter-laboratory comparison studies for different salmonella detection methods among the eu's national reference laboratories  of member states  <cit> . these studies performed on both artificially and naturally contaminated samples have shown that msrv are more sensitive than methods based on rvs enrichment . both methods include a pre-enrichment in buffered peptone water , but the second enrichment is done either on modified semisolid rappaport-vassiliadis agar  or in rappaport-vassiliadis sojapepton broth , with over night incubation.

in a study  <cit>  on faecal samples from pigs , calves  and cows , msrv enrichment was found to be significantly more sensitive than rv enrichment when analysing pig samples, whereas no difference could be discerned in cattle samples. the performance of msrv was significantly better compared to rv enrichment also for poultry faecal samples, according to a study published by voogt et al.  <cit> . rv  was the broth used in the 3rd edition of the iso method  for salmonella detection, but an improvement has since been made to this broth, including soy-peptone and also using a different concentration of magnesium chloride.

the vidas system has been evaluated by korsak et al,  <cit>  for salmonella analysis of animal faeces. in this study the authors found that vidas was comparable to the nmkl <dig> method. it has also been evaluated for faecal samples, with promising results, by sommerhauser & failing  <cit> .

regarding the bioline methods  included in this study, as far as we know, nothing has been published on analyses of faecal samples.

a few reports have appeared on diagnostic pcr testing using faecal samples but to our knowledge no comprehensive comparison of culture vs. pcr diagnostics. however, there are reports  <cit>  indicating that pcr diagnostics using faecal samples can give e results comparable to culture methods.

the aim of the present study was to perform the evaluation as instructed by the swedish board of agriculture, in order to assess potential rapid replacement methods for the nmkl <dig> method. furthermore, the msrv method, suggested to be a new annex to the iso  <dig> standard  <cit>  and which is the method recommended by the eu's crl for salmonella for analysis of salmonella in faecal samples  <cit>  was included in the present study.

results from the pooled samples consisting of assumed salmonella- free faeces
the results from the analyses of the  <dig> suspected salmonella-negative pooled faecal samples are summarized in table  <dig>  except for the bax® protocol, which indicated one positive sample, none of the other methods revealed salmonella in any of the  <dig> "unspiked samples". three methods  failed to detect salmonella in one of the spiked control samples that were run parallel with the unspiked samples.

results of trials 1–3: poultry faeces spiked with different concentrations of salmonella
the results from trial 1– <dig> are presented in table  <dig> 

in trial  <dig>  mixed faeces from two egg-producing farms were spiked with different concentrations of s. enteritidis.

in trial  <dig>  mixed faeces from two egg-producing farms and one broiler farm were spiked with different levels of s. worthington. due to a technical fault, one of the sextuplicates in the lowest spiking level was excluded from the selecta enrichment based methods. only the msrv-based methods succeeded in detecting salmonella in all spiked samples . the methods involving any immunological technique  were in this trial generally less sensitive than the methods based on culturing only or pcr without any immunological techniques involved.

in trial  <dig>  mixed faeces from two egg-producing farms and one broiler farm were spiked with different concentrations of s. livingstone. as in trial  <dig> the elisa-based methods in this trial were generally less sensitive than the other method. bioline selecta failed to detect salmonella in any of the spiked samples whereas culturing with the selecta enrichment found salmonella in all the spiked samples. the selecta- ims-pcr that included an immunological technique  had on the other hand in this trial a sensitivity of  <dig> , almost equal to selecta-pcr .

results from trials 4–6: pig faeces spiked with different concentrations of salmonella
the results from trial 4– <dig> are presented in table  <dig> 

in trial  <dig>  mixed faeces from three pig farms were spiked with different concentrations of s. derby. the nmkl methods, nmkl  and bioline optima culture  were in this trial relatively less sensitive than the other methods.

in trial  <dig>  mixed faeces from three pig farms were spiked with different concentrations of s. cubana while in trial  <dig> similarly s. typhimurium dt <dig> was used. in trail  <dig>  all culturing methods had problems in detecting this s. typhimurium dt <dig> strain at the lower spiking levels. the msrv method failed to detect salmonella in  <dig> samples at the lowest level . whereas throughout the study the msrv method detected all the positive salmonella samples after  <dig> h incubation of the msrv agar plates, in this trial,  <dig> of the  <dig> positive samples were not detected until the msrv agar plates had been incubated for  <dig> h. for one sample, at the lowest inoculation level, plating out from the msrv did not yield any salmonella colonies even though msrv-pcr confirmation yielded a positive result. after a new attempt to plate out from the msrv agar plate, positive salmonella colonies were detected.

the nmkl methods  required spiking concentrations as high as  <dig>  <dig> cfu/ <dig> g before they were able to detect salmonella in any sample. the bioline selecta culture method also had problems and required spiking concentrations as high as  <dig> cfu/ <dig> g until the method was able to detect any positive sample.

the bax® pcr protocol  had best sensitivity of all methods in trial  <dig>  the in-house pcr methods based on the bioline selecta enrichment protocol had sensitivities ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> 

results from trials 7–9: cattle faeces spiked with different concentrations of salmonella
the results from trial 7– <dig> are presented in table  <dig>  trials 7– <dig> included, in addition to the methods used in trial 1– <dig>  the selenite/cystine method.

in trial  <dig>  mixed faeces from one farm were spiked with different concentrations of s. typhimurium dt <dig> 

in trial  <dig>  mixed faeces from three cattle farms were spiked with different concentrations of s. dublin strain. in this trial all methods based on rvs enrichment had difficulties in detecting this particular s. dublin strain. as none of the rvs enrichment based methods detected any positive samples in the first test run at the highest spiking level of  <dig> cfu/ <dig> g, a re-run was performed with higher spiking concentrations . however, analyses in this re-run were not performed for all methods. the rvs enrichment based nmkl method was unable to detect any positive salmonella at any spiking level lower than  <dig>  cfu/ <dig> g faeces  whereas msrv based methods , bioline selecta culture  and pcr methods based on bioline selecta enrichment broth  detected salmonella in the trials lowest spiking level . the bax® method did not detect any positive sample at any level lower than  <dig> cfu/ <dig> g faeces. the selenite/cystine method sensitivity  surpassed the rvs enrichment based methods.

in trial  <dig>  mixed faeces from three cattle farms were spiked with different concentrations of a s. tennnesse strain.

extended method for isolation of salmonella from the samples indicated to be salmonella-positive by the bax® salmonella detection method
the bax® system produced no positive results from the non-seeded control samples in the nine trial runs. it did, however, yield one suspected response from the  <dig> pooled faecal samples that were believed to be free from salmonella . from this sample we attempted to isolate salmonella, as described in materials & methods, but were unsuccessful when using the additional methods. nor was this sample found salmonella positive by any other salmonella detection method, including culture-based, elisa and in-house pcr methods. we therefore chose to regard this sample as a false positive result

discussion
overall, the msrv method proved to be the most reliable and sensitive method for detecting salmonella in faecal samples, regardless of which species the faeces originated from. the msrv method requires the selective agar plates to be read after both  <dig> and  <dig> hours. in our study, only one trial run yielded more positive samples after  <dig> h than after  <dig> h incubation of the msrv agar plates. these were the samples spiked with s. typhimurium dt <dig>  which also proved difficult to detect with several other salmonella detection methods used in the study. a  <dig> h incubation of msrv agar plates has been shown to increase the number of detected salmonella-positive samples in other studies  <cit> . to hasten the confirmation of suspected salmonella growth on msrv, a pcr-based colony confirmation technique was used directly from the msrv agar plates, which proved to be rapid, specific and sensitive. the pcr confirmation succeeded in detecting all the msrv-positive samples in the study, and in addition one extra positive sample which was not detected by conventional confirmation, but which was shown to be a true positive by a second attempt to isolate salmonella from the msrv agar plate.

the pcr-based methods used in the study proved almost as sensitive and specific as the msrv method. however, the elisa-based methods performed less well, and this seemed to be correlated to the salmonella strain used when spiking the faecal samples in the different trials. for instance, s. livingstone and s. worthington were not easily detected by some of the elisa methods used, probably because of poor binding to the antibodies. this was also noted when using immuno magnetic separation  for salmonella with dynal magnetic beads coated with antibodies, and is a clear drawback for this detection strategy.

the first set of samples analysed was  <dig> assumed salmonella-negative pooled samples consisting of faeces originating from  <dig> different swedish farms. these samples were so devised as to have a wide variation in the composition of the intrinsic bacterial flora. this was done in order to attempt to elicit false positive results by the different salmonella detection methods used. this could be a problem especially for methods using antibody-based salmonella detection strategies, if the antibodies are not sufficiently specific.

in the seeding experiments, spiked samples were prepared, divided among nine different trial sets; three each using poultry, pig and cattle faeces. as the experiment was performed in sweden, and naturally infected faecal samples are rare and difficult to obtain, artificially contaminated samples were used. to attempt to imitate natural conditions, where salmonella bacteria might be stressed, the salmonella cultures were subjected to stress treatments before seeding them into the faecal samples. we also tried to prepare the different spiking concentrations so that the nmkl method would be able to detect salmonella in about half of the spiked samples in each trial set, as our aim was to evaluate the possibility of replacing the nmkl method with a more rapid salmonella detection method.

the very low levels of stressed salmonella bacteria, as seen in the lowest spikning level in our study, might not be so frequently encountered among naturally infected samples. thus in our opinion, if a method in the present study performs with sensitivity twice as high as any other method, this does not necessarily mean that the method would reveal twice as many salmonella-positive samples in naturally infected faeces. what it does imply is that the method is more likely to detect salmonella in faeces when only a small number of stressed salmonella bacteria are present, and where the intrinsic flora is abundant and varied. this might for instance be the case when analysing pooled faecal samples.

it is difficult to compare our results with other studies, where other reference methods may have been used. also, in other studies, different enrichment protocols and media may have been used and there may have been slight differences in the protocols used. furthermore, our pretreatment to stress the salmonella bacteria that was used in the trials and the treatment of the spiked samples may have influenced the results.

the nmkl method 
the low sensitivity obtained with s. typhimurium dt <dig> and s. dublin made the nmkl methods perform relatively poorly in our study. even if we disregard the results regarding these two serotypes, the nmkl methods are generally less sensitive than the msrv-method and the selecta culturing method . these results are consistent with other studies  <cit>  that have indicated that msrv enrichment is more sensitive than rvs enrichment.

the nmkl method and the iso  <dig> method are currently the methods that are approved for use for faecal samples in the swedish salmonella control program . in our study, these were the reference method with which all other methods were compared. the nmkl method showed a variable ability to detect salmonella in the spiked faecal samples, depending on the strain used. the method was performed as two separate analyses run in parallel. one analysis used rvs enrichment broth manufactured by oxoid and the other rvs broth that was supplied by bioline. in both cases the nmkl method had severe problems in detecting  <dig> of the  <dig> different salmonella strains used, viz. s. typhimurium dt <dig>  and s. dublin . the salmonella strains used in our study were chosen to be typical serotypes found in the routine diagnostics of respective animal species, and s. typhimurium dt <dig> is the serotype most commonly encountered in pigs in the scp, particularly in mesenteric lymph nodes from slaughtered pigs. s. dublin, the other serotype that caused problems in the nklm method, is one of the most commonly found serotype in cattle faeces.

in a separate study performed at the national veterinary institute we analysed  <dig> faecal samples collected from cattle in a s. dublin infected herd, using the conventional nmkl method, the selenite/cystine method and the msrv method as described in this study. of a total of  <dig> samples proven positive,  <dig> were found using the msrv-method,  <dig> by selenite/cystine and only  <dig> by conventional nmkl method . this tallies with the results presented in the present study.

the strain that was used to spike the cattle feacal samples in our study was isolated from a farm situated in the same part of sweden as the above-mentioned s. dublin infected herd. it may be that both farms were infected with the same salmonella strain and that the nmkl method in particular has problems in detecting this specific strain. the sensitivity for other s. dublin strains may be better.

the low degree of sensitivity obtained with s. typhimurium dt <dig> and s. dublin made the nmkl methods perform relatively poorly in the study. even if one disregards the results obtained with these two serotypes, the overall sensitivity of the nmkl methods is less than with both the msrv method and the selecta culturing method . our results are consistent with those of the eu's crl for salmonella  <cit> .

the msrv method
this method is to be incorporated into an annex to the iso method  <dig> for salmonella detection, and is the method recommended by eu's crl for analysis of faecal samples from animals  <cit> . it was included in our study as it was deemed important to compare the performance of this method with the nmkl method currently used in the scp.

in our study, the msrv method was the most sensitive and specific method. it detected all the nine different salmonella strains used, at very low spiking levels. it performed equally well with faeces from the three animal species included in the study. in addition to the standard confirmation protocol from msrv agar plates  we used real-time pcr to quickly confirm the presence of salmonella in the growth zones on the msrv-agar plates. one loop  <dig> μl was dipped into the zone and colony material was transferred to a pre-prepared pcr-tube and the pcr analysis was performed immediately. this 1-day speed-up of the confirmation can be advantageous in, for instance, the event of a salmonella outbreak situation. this quicker pcr confirmation performed equally well as the standard confirmation protocol.

enrichment according to the bioline selecta protocol, confirmed by cultivation on selective agar plates
for salmonella detection the selecta protocol with enrichment and subsequent cultivation on xld- and bga agar plates is 1-day quicker than the nmkl method. the overall calculated performance of the selecta culturing method gave a sensitivity of  <dig>  compared with the nmkl method, which showed a sensitivity of  <dig>  . however, a drawback with the selecta protocol is that it is difficult to handle large sample volumes as it is of uttermost importance to maintain the appropriate temperatures as well as to comply strictly to the incubation times in the different enrichment steps, as recommended by the manufacturer.

when evaluating results obtained with the selecta enrichment protocol one should take into account that the incubation times used in this study were not optimal . the manufacturer recommends pre-enrichment  for 6– <dig> h and enrichment  for 18– <dig> h. in our study, in order to test the method's capacity to provide results quickly, bpw pre-enrichment was performed for 6– <dig> h and selecta enrichment for 18– <dig> h. if these incubation times had been extended, performance using the methods based on selecta enrichment may well have been improved.

bioline selecta
the bioline selecta method is a commercially available assay for salmonella detection, based on a patented enrichment protocol completed within  <dig> h, and subsequent analysis with an elisa kit. the method has been validated according to nordval  <cit>  and afnor criteria  <cit> . in sweden it is approved by the swedish national food administration  for salmonella detection within the official national control program for food.

bioline selecta is one of the quickest salmonella detection methods included in this study. compared with the nmkl methods, bioline selecta elisa gave better results for both porcine and bovine faecal samples . with the poultry samples, however, some difficulty was encountered in trial  <dig> and especially in trial  <dig>  possibly due to matrix problems when broiler faeces were mixed with faeces from layer hens in these two trials. another plausible explanation is that the antibodies used in the elisa had difficulties in detecting the specific strains of salmonella used in these trial sets . such problems may be related not to the serotypes but to these particular salmonella strains. most probably these strains were spread to swedish poultry farms by dry feedstuffs and may have undergone some alteration in immunological composition during storage. this finding warrants further investigation.

bioline optima
bioline optima is a commercially available assay for salmonella detection, where a pre-enrichment step using bpw and a selective enrichment step with rvs broth preceede salmonella detection with an elisa kit. the method has been validated for food samples according to nordval  <cit>  and afnor criteria  <cit> . in sweden it is sanctioned by the nfa for salmonella detection within the official national control program for food. the bioline optima elisa method showed the poorest performance of all methods included in the study, with an overall calculated sensitivity of  <dig>  . performance was especially poor for the poultry samples  whereas the trials with porcine and bovine faeces gave somewhat better results . bioline optima culturing method gave results generally comparable to the nmkl method , results that are reasonable since the only difference between the methods was that we used rvs enrichment broth from different producers.

vidas slm
vidas slm, a commercially available method, is currently used by regional microbiological laboratories in sweden, and was therefore included in the study. the method has been validated for food samples according to nordval  <cit>  and afnor criteria  <cit> . in sweden it is sanctioned by the nfa or salmonella detection within the official national control program for food.

several enrichment protocols for salmonella  were available for the vidas system when the study was performed in  <dig>  however, after discussion with the manufacturer we agreed to use no other enrichment broths than rvs and m-broth. the protocol used was also the enrichment protocol recommended by the manufacturer at the time. another reason for leaving out other enrichment broths was that we wanted to evaluate the performance of the vidas system on faecal samples using a protocol based solely on the same enrichment broths that were routinely used by swedish regional laboratories when analysing food samples.

the enrichment protocol used in the present study, as was recommended by the manufacturer, might not be optimal for faecal samples. in a collaboration initiated after the study, the manufacturer has repeated some of the experiments using a modified enrichment protocol, using bpw followed by mkttn and m broth, which produced considerably improved results.

in our study, the vidas slm method performed comparably to the nmkl method , giving slightly better results for pig faeces and slightly poorer results for cattle and poultry faeces. these results are consistent with the study performed by korsak et al.  <cit>  who found that the vidas system was comparable to the nmkl <dig> method. in another study dam-deisz et al. <cit>  concluded that vidas gave better results for cattle samples than the compared culture method, though the reference culture method in that study included only a single enrichment step and cannot be compared with the reference methods used in our study.

the poor results for s. dublin in cattle faeces may well be due to the same poor performance with enrichment broths as was observed with the nmkl method. as for the poultry samples the vidas slm performed badly regarding s. livingstone, possibly due to the poor binding of specific salmonella strains to the antibodies used in the elisa kit, similar to the findings for selecta-elisa described above.

bax® 
bax® system worked well in the trial, except with the s. dublin samples in trial  <dig>  in all other trial sets the sensitivity of the bax® system was excellent. the lower sensitivity in trial  <dig> could in our opinion have been because the s. dublin strain used did not grow so well in the second enrichment medium  used in the bax® protocol, modified for optimal performance in faecal samples. this replicates the poor growth of s. dublin in methods depending on rvs broth and selenite/cystine for secondary enrichment.

in an american study, performance with the bax® system in feed analysis was compared with a most probable number  method  <cit> . that study revealed the sensitivity of the bax® system to be dependent on the enrichment protocol applied. as in our study a modified protocol, recommended by the manufacturer, was used to reduce the risk of pcr inhibition. it was also shown that sensitivity improved when enrichment was prolonged from  <dig> h to  <dig> h.

bax® identified one sample in the set of  <dig> un-seeded pooled samples as positive for salmonella. at the time of the study, the protocol used for bax® was a draft protocol, as suggested by the manufacturer, and the protocol we received did not include any specified confirmation step. therefore, no confirmation step for the bax® method was used. however, none of the other methods could verify this sample as salmonella positive. neither could further attempts with repeated analyses by culture methods, performed on stored material, confirm this sample as salmonella positive.

it might be that the bax® system detected an atypical salmonella strain that was difficult to isolate by the culturing methods used.

it seems unlikely that dna from dead salmonella bacteria present in the faecal sample could explain this positive result. if such dna had been present in the pooled faecal sample, the two enrichment steps must have considerably lowered the concentration of dna, available for pcr detection. furthermore, none of the other included pcr method, which also would have been able to detect dna from dead salmonella bacteria, classified this sample as positive.

however, as we were unable to confirm the positive salmonella finding this result was considered as a false positive and the overall specificity was therefore calculated to be  <dig> .

bioline selecta followed by in-house pcr
by using pcr as confirmation after the bioline selecta protocol, a rapid method was obtained, the most rapid method together with bioline selecta elisa of the methods tested in the study. the method had a sensitivity of  <dig>  and no false positive results were obtained among the  <dig> non-seeded samples. this is a very easy method to perform, as no dna extraction was done before the pcr analysis. also, this would be a very low-cost screening method. the method may further have potential to improve its sensitivity if the incubation times in the selekta enrichment protocol is extended see discussion above .

however, the method needs to be validated to be able to use it for official salmonella control.

bioline selecta enrichment followed by ims separation of salmonella and in-house pcr
to try to enhance the sensitivity of the in-house pcr we introduced an immuno-magnetic separation step, using salmonella-specific antibodies prior to the pcr analysis. the immuno-magnetic step makes this method take a little longer time than the method described above. it will also be more expensive to perform, as the immuno-magnetic beads with antibodies to salmonella are quite expensive, and as we also included a dna-separation step before pcr, because using the beads directly in the pcr strongly inhibited the pcr reactions. in spite of adding the immuno-magnetic and the dna extraction steps, this method does not perform better than bioline selecta enrichment followed by in-house pcr as described above. we believe that the method performs differently, depending on the salmonella strain used for seeding, because some serotypes/strains bind weakly to the antibodies used. when using salmonella serotypes/strains having a high affinity to the immuno-magnetic beads, a high degree of sensitivity is obtained, but for other serotypes/strains the method does not perform equally well.

summary of results of pcr- based methods used in the study
in a minireview article, malorny and hoorfar  <cit>  discuss different approaches to diagnostic pcr testing of porcine faecal samples. optimal enrichment is important, as it must enable sub-lethally injured salmonella cells to recover and grow but simultaneously should inhibit the growth of the background flora. the pcr protocols must be modified to prevent the problem of pcr inhibition that occurs when using faecal samples. the authors also discuss the potential of pcr methods for quantification of salmonella in pig faeces.

in a canadian study  <cit>  faecal samples from  <dig> pigs were tested with microbiological culture and a cultivation pcr assay. the authors concluded that their pcr assay had a low detection limit and detected similar numbers of shedding and non-shedding animals as did the culture method. the pcr assay in that study was performed on a mixture of three different enrichment broths incubated for  <dig> days. an american study  <cit>  in  <dig> also presented results showing that their combined cultivation pcr assay identified salmonella serovars in clinical samples from pigs, horses and cattle with same sensitivity and specificity, but more quickly than with the conventional culture techniques being compared.

on the whole, the pcr based methods in our study were very sensitive, especially when compared with the nmkl method. some are comparable to the msrv method, which was the most sensitive method of all. however, a possible drawback of pcr methods is that they may yield positive results for salmonella, but confirmation by culturing cannot be obtained. this could be due to stressed bacteria or because certain serotypes are difficult to culture, but also to false positive results of the pcr-based method. if, on the other hand, these methods  are regarded as a screening test, where positive signals need to be confirmed by culturing techniques, this would be acceptable. if a negative pcr result is obtained, the analysis can be terminated, and further confirmation is unnecessary. the most important feature of a method used as a screening test is its sensitivity, and a lower specificity is acceptable. however, when too many samples test positive and cannot be confirmed by culturing, the method become too laborious

CONCLUSIONS
the msrv method was the method in our study that performed with greatest specificity and sensitivity. it could detect very low concentrations of spiked, stressed salmonella bacteria of different serotypes and in faecal samples from different animal species. the nmkl method, which is currently used in the scp, did vary substantially in performance; depending on which salmonella strain was seeded into the faecal samples.

the pcr-based salmonella detection methods used in our study performed almost as well as the msrv method, though the elisa-based methods were serotype or strain dependent, and did not give a satisfactory overall performance.
