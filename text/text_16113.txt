BACKGROUND
the intestinal epithelium comprises multiple cell types which are progenitors of the stem cells located in crypt region. during their migration along the crypt axis epithelial cells differentiate from proliferative cells into secretory cells or absorptive enterocytes  <cit>  epithelial cell growth, motility and morphogenesis are controlled by soluble factors such as transforming growth factor beta   <cit> , a multifunctional growth factor  <cit> . mesenchymal cells producing tgfβ are in turn regulated by various hormonal, paracrine and exogenous factors  <cit> . epithelial cells can also regulate their own gene expression via negative regulatory feedback loops  <cit> . the role of the specific signaling pathways across the crypt axis, and the transcription factors controlling the crypt-specific expression of specific genes has been characterized  <cit> , but the molecular events synergistically leading to the transition of crypt-like cells into absorptive enterocytes call for further study. the key to an understanding of cellular differentiation and development is elucidation of the molecular events regulating transcription. research on epithelial cell differentiation in primary cell cultures has been hampered by the poor viability of stem cells  <cit> , and the tumor cell lines capable of differentiating have thus been extensively used in studies of epithelial cell differentiation  <cit> . in a model created by our group, t <dig> epithelial cells grown three-dimensionally are induced to differentiate either by soluble factors secreted by mesenchymal cells  or by addition of tgfβ <dig>  <cit> . t <dig> cells differentiated in this model are shown to express alkaline phosphatase and sialomucin, that are usually expressed by villus tip epithelial cells in normal duodenum, while the expression of c-met-proto oncogene has been shown to be down-regulated  <cit> . differentiated t <dig> are shown to be negative for sulfomucin that is usually expressed in colon  <cit> . imr fibroblast-induced differentiation of t <dig> cells has been shown to occur in a tgfβ1-dependent manner  <cit> . the advantage of our model is that differentiation commences only after induction, and the differentiation process can therefore be studied precisely. it has already been harnessed to study alterations in gene expression during epithelial cell differentiation by employing differential display  <cit> . by this method we have found several novel candidate genes, for example sap30l, which might have a role in the epithelial cell differentiation  <cit> .

tgfβ1-induced cell-type specific signal transduction networks warrants further clarification  <cit> . in the present study, using cdna microarray and taking advantage of our three-dimensional epithelial cell culture, our aim was to find novel molecular changes in gene expression accompanying epithelial cell differentiation only in undifferentiated and differentiated cultures. furthermore, we compared the gene expressions in epithelial cells mediated either by tgfβ <dig> or soluble factors excreted by imr- <dig> mesenchymal cells.

RESULTS
in the three-dimensional epithelial cell differentiation model, crypt-like t <dig> epithelial cells were induced to differentiate either by tgfβ <dig>  or by soluble factors secreted by imr- <dig> type human embryonic lung fibroblasts . the t <dig> cells cultured within collagen gel supplemented with medium were used as undifferentiated controls  <cit> . the study focused on detecting changes in gene expression upon differentiation; we therefore studied undifferentiated and differentiated epithelial cells harvested after seven days of culturing. altogether the transcription of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes was found to be significantly altered when tgfβ1-differentiated and imr-differentiated cultures were compared to the undifferentiated control culture. all the affected genes were grouped into ontology classes according to their known or predicted functions. from all significantly altered genes  <dig> % attended on metabolism, other than energy metabolism , and 90% of them were down-regulated. genes in the subgroup of metabolism, the generation of precursor metabolites and energy , were affected in 2% of all genes.  <dig> % of genes controlled the cell cycle and dna processing ), and 91% of them were down-regulated in differentiated cells.  <dig> % of affected genes regulated transcription regulator activity , and 83% of them were down-regulated in differentiated cells. genes coding proteins for signal transducer activity  was the largest functional group, 27% of all significantly altered genes. 13% of the genes that had significantly altered expression affected to protein folding i.e. cellular macromolecule metabolism . genes having a role to cell rescue and defense i.e. inflammatory response  were 5% of all affected genes. all genes belonging to this group were down-regulated in differentiated cells. equal amount of affected genes  controlled cellular organization i.e. organelle organization and biogenesis  and transport . one quarter  of all affected genes had yet no known role in biological processes . in imr-differentiated cells several of the genes were slightly but insignificantly affected . a full list of the genes in question is presented as an additional file .

protein concentrations and immunohistochemistry
the western immunoblotting was carried out with five selected proteins to ascertain whether the changes seen at mrna level would be in concordance with the protein level. epidermal growth factor receptor  and β-catenin were chosen because they are involved in cell differentiation and we detected changes in their expression at mrna level. c-myc, a nuclear phospho-protein and oncogene which regulates proliferation in cells was chosen as it has been shown to be up-regulated in proliferating cells  <cit> . cytokeratin  <dig>  a protein constructing intermediary filaments, was also chosen because it was highly expressed in differentiated cells  <cit> . β-actin was used as internal control  <cit> . the protein expression ratios of β-catenin, egfr, c-myc and cytokeratin  <dig> quantitated and calculated from the western blots , were comparable in tgfβ1-differentiated and in imr-differentiated cells .

the amount and localization of two selected proteins, c-myc and cytokeratin  <dig>  were further studied with immunostainings. c-myc stained the nuclei intensively in undifferentiated, unorganized t <dig> epithelial cell clusters , whereas in tgfβ-treated, differentiated and organized cell clusters the nuclei labeling was faint . in figures 2c and 2d are the immunostainings with cytokeratin  <dig>  the labeling was clearly up-regulated upon differentiation by tgfβ . the immunostainings were in line with the results from microarray and immunoblotting indicating high c-myc and low cytokeratin  <dig> concentrations in the undifferentiated control culture and low c-myc and high cytokeratin  <dig> concentrations in tgfβ-differentiated cell culture.

discussion
the three-dimensional intestinal epithelial cell differentiation model has been successfully used to study cell differentiation  <cit> . in this model crypt-like t <dig> cells, when grown three-dimensionally in collagen gel, are induced to differentiate either by the soluble factors secreted from imr fibroblasts or by tgfβ <dig>  <cit> . imr-induced differentiation has been shown to occur in a tgfβ-dependent manner  <cit> , and it has been concluded that the differentiation of t <dig> cells in the present co-culture models the differentiation of epithelial cells in intestine  <cit> .

here we used the cdna microarray method and our cell culture model to gain additional insight into the genetic programming of epithelial cells upon differentiation. furthermore, we examined similarities and differences in gene expressions when differentiation was induced either by tgfβ <dig> or by mesenchymal cell  soluble factors. differentiation altered expression of  <dig> genes, and  <dig> of them were altered by both mediators.

a major trend seen in differentiated cultures was a diminishing expression of transcription factors, growth factors and molecules regulated by them. also the transcription of genes attending to the mrna processing, translation and folding of proteins were decreased in tgfβ1-differentiated epithelial cells. the decreased expression of the above-mentioned factors and signaling molecules, such as cathepsin s or mrlp, were similar in our three-dimensional epithelial cell differentiation model to those observed in spontaneously differentiating caco- <dig> adenocarcinoma cells  <cit> . also in the mouse cell lines, the genes attending to proliferation and transcription regulation, for example c-myc, have been shown to decrease during differentiation of epithelial cells  <cit> . in other studies of epithelial differentiation, both in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro  <cit> , the number of down-regulated genes compared to up-regulated genes has not been so prominent as in this study. however, it is noteworthy that in these previous studies, as well as in our study, most functional groups show particularly distinct down-regulation of gene expression in differentiated cells.

there were several genes that are previously shown to be affected in spontaneously differentiating caco- <dig> cells, and that had significant change transcription in our model: the transcription of genes associated with proliferation such as c-myc or cyclin d <dig> were decreased in tgfβ1-differentiated cells and in differentiated caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . also the genes coding proteins attending to the gene expression, for example helicases and zinc finger proteins, were down-regulated in tgfβ1- and imr-differentiated cells similarly as in differentiated caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . transcription of genes associated to protein synthesis, such as ribosomal proteins and translation initiators   <cit> , were decreased in tgfβ1- and imr-differentiated as in differentiated caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . decreased expression of ubiquiting-conjugating enzymes was consistent with the findings derived from differentiated caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . ubiquitinated proteins then recognized by 26s proteasome complex and then destructed. from proteasome complex proteins one component of 26s complex  and two components of 20s complex  were down-regulated in tgfβ1-differentiated cells. in differentiated caco- <dig> cells mariadason et al. did not find alterations in 26s complex but they found several components of 20s complex being down-regulated  <cit> . in that study expression of several signaling molecules in mapk-pathway were decreased  <cit> , whereas in our study only the expression of mapkapk <dig> from mapk-pathway was significantly decreased. genes that were commonly affected in tgfβ-, wnt- and receptor tyrosine kinase-signaling routes are being discussed later in the text.

in cell division and cellular growth there is an increase in expression of genes regulating transcription, as well as genes coding for mrna splicing machinery, protein translation and protein folding machinery  <cit> . we saw an up-regulation of genes that control protein synthesis such as ribosomal protein , mitochondrial ribosomal protein , and initiation factor  in undifferentiated cells. genes taking part to nuclear rna processing  and splicing, , exhibited up-regulation in undifferentiated epithelial cells compared to the differentiated cells. also genes coding ubiquiting-conjugating enzymes , and two genes from proteasome complex , were up-regulated in undifferentiated epithelial cells. increased demand of energy in proliferating cells in known to induce up-regulation of genes coding oxidative phosphorylation machinery  <cit> . in our model genes coding components of oxidative phosphorylation pathway, , were up regulated in undifferentiated cultures. all these above mentioned genes, were up-regulated in dividing epithelial cells in the study of stappenbeck et al. that was done with mouse small intestinal epithelial progenitors  <cit> . hence these changes in the gene expression imply that epithelial cells grown untreated in collagen i gel cultures were more actively dividing than epithelial cells treated with tgfβ <dig> or with imr fibroblasts.

genes involved in tgfβ-, wnt- and receptor tyrosine kinase-signaling routes 
the transcription of the genes on tgfβ-, receptor tyrosine kinase-, and wnt-pathways are known to be affected upon differentiation of the epithelial cells  <cit> . as our epithelial cell differentiation model revealed a number of both expected and new transcripts regulated by tgfβ which might be involved in these pathways, all results from microarrays were depicted in the form of signaling cascades. the detailed signaling pathway picture  was drawn according to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  in homo sapiens  <cit>  and according to previously published results  <cit> . the focus was set to describe the cross-talk between signaling pathways.

in our epithelial cell differentiation model tgfβ <dig> induced up-regulation of tgfβ co-repressor tgif and tgfβ early growth response gene , and down-regulation of type ii tgfβ receptor , creb binding protein , transcription factor dp- <dig> , e2f4/ <dig>  c-myc and id <dig> . in the intestine tgfβ receptors and ligands are expressed predominantly in the differentiated compartment  <cit> . in caco- <dig> cells the expression of tβ rii has been shown to spike during transition from proliferation to differentiation and then to decline after transition  <cit> . in caco- <dig> cells the induction of tieg transcription is used as an indicator of activation of the tgfβ-signaling pathway by differentiation  <cit> . in another study made with caco- <dig> cells the transcription of e2f <dig> and c-myc was shown to decrease upon differentiation  <cit> . comparing our results to others, it appeared that the tgfβ pathway was active in our tgfβ-treated, differentiated, cell culture  <cit> .

we showed that tgfβ <dig> induced down-regulation of the expression of β-catenin, siah, icat and tle <dig>  however, e-cadherin remained constant and the expression of tcf- <dig> was exiguous in the wnt pathway . the wnt-signaling pathway is known to abate in differentiated epithelial cells in cultures  <cit>  and in the intestine  <cit> . it would thus appear that the wnt signaling pathway down stream on β-catenin is quiescent in tgfβ-differentiated cells  <cit> .

furthermore tgfβ <dig> decreased expression of the egfr, the p <dig> subunit of pi3-k, plcγ, c-myc, grb and nfκb . in normal epithelial cells the activation of the rtk-pathway, for example egfr, is known to activate pi3-kinase and plcγ  <cit>  and also to promote proliferation and growth  <cit> . the decreased activation upstream of the rtk-pathway might be a result of decreased expression of c-myc and decreased proliferation  <cit> . the expression of the p <dig> subunit of pi3-k was decreased in our tgfβ-differentiated t <dig> cells. in contrast to our results, in differentiated caco- <dig> cells the transcription of pi3-k p <dig> has been found to be increased  <cit> . however, the over-expression of pi3-k p <dig> subunit is shown to inhibit differentiation and over-expression of p <dig> to promote differentiation  <cit> , suggesting that a balance between different subunits is vitally important.

in the present study tgfβ1-induced differentiation appeared to alter the expression of the signaling molecules upstream on the rtk- and wnt-pathways. we therefore directed our attention to the mechanisms underlying the reprogramming events taking place during epithelial cell differentiation. in order to understand the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of epithelial cells it is essential to understand precisely how the signals are modulated and fine-tuned within the cells. during the differentiation of epithelial cells several signaling pathways are known to act synergistically and to interact via common mediators, modulate the outcomes by varying the interacting partners  <cit> , or co-operatively fine-tune the transcription of a single molecule  <cit> . for example akt, a serine/threonine kinase, is a molecular nodal point of several signaling cascades  <cit>  which can deliver the signal to several different pathways and alter the outcome of the signal as well: in the wnt-pathway akt activates proliferation by preventing the formation of the gsk3β/apc/β-catenin-destruction complex  <cit> , in the nfκb route it regulates antiapoptosis  <cit> , and by positively regulating crebbp it also regulates differentiation  <cit> . in our three-dimensional epithelial cell differentiation model in tgfβ1-treated cells akt <dig> was down-regulated . thus the decreased expression of akt may induce the down-regulation of the wnt and nfκb-route and decreased signaling to crebbp. indeed all these signaling routes  were down-regulated in tgfβ1-treated culture. several signaling pathways can synergistically modulate the function of a single gene such as c-myc, whose expression is tightly regulated by the tgfβ-, wnt- and rtk-pathways. activation of the tgfβ route reduces expression of c-myc  <cit>  contribute to growth arrest  <cit> , whereas activation of the wnt and rtk-pathways induces c-myc expression and proliferation  <cit> . c-myc has been shown to be down-regulated upon differentiation in epithelial cell cultures  <cit>  and in the normal intestine  <cit> . in our crypt villus axis model we saw down-regulation of c-myc at both mrna and protein levels in differentiated cells, suggesting the synergistic action of these signaling routes to the expression of c-myc . it appears that the molecular changes seen in rtk- and wnt-signaling pathways are consequences of tgfβ <dig>  our results suggest that tgfβ <dig> modulates, either directly or indirectly, the transcription of the mediators on these signaling pathways .

t <dig> cells have been reported to respond correctly to added stimulants in the tgfβ- and rtk-pathways, and the wnt-pathway at β-catenin level  <cit> . as all cancerous cell lines are known to have mutations in their genes  <cit> , the molecules under investigation might also have been mutated  <cit>  and this must be borne in mind when interpreting results.

differentially expressed novel, as yet uncharacterized genes
altogether  <dig> % of the differentially expressed genes detected here had hitherto no characterized functions. several of them for example loc <dig>  rp4-622l <dig>  flj <dig>  fcho <dig>  smg <dig> and several ests  are reported to be expressed at the embryonic stage but not in juveniles. furthermore they have been shown to be expressed in the intestine  <cit> . these sequences with unknown function are especially interesting in the search for new players which may act in epithelial cell differentiation.

tgfβ-induced versus imr fibroblast-induced differentiation
the comparison of results from tgfβ1- and imr-differentiated cultures revealed  <dig> commonly altered genes. majority of them  <cit>  were similarly expressed, down-regulated. it is known that mesenchymal cells secrete several soluble factors which control epithelial growth, motility and morphogenesis  <cit> . imr fibroblasts, by secreting several mediating factors, induce natural differentiation  <cit> . the imr fibroblast-induced differentiation of t <dig> cells has been shown to occur in a tgfβ1-dependent manner  <cit> . however, after seven days of culturing a smaller proportion of cells is differentiated in imr-differentiated than in tgfβ1-differentiated culture  <cit> . also in the present study, the expression changes detected by microarray were stronger in the tgfβ1-differentiated cells, compared to imr-differentiated cells. in caco- <dig> cells the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor  has been shown to spike during transition from proliferation to differentiation and to decline after the transition  <cit> . in our model the transcription of pdgfr was up-regulated in imr- but unchanged in tgfβ-differentiated cells . comparing our results to the ones from caco- <dig> cells, it looks as imr-differentiated cells may have been in transition from proliferation to differentiation and tgfβ1-differentiated cell cultures had already passed the transition stage. according to the mrna expression data, the tgfβ1-induced differentiation appears to be more potent than the natural imr fibroblast-induced differentiation. this might reflect the fact that tgfβ <dig> is a single, potent differentiating factor always inducing similar differentiation, whereas the imr fibroblasts secrete various factors which may induce variation also in differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that tgfβ <dig> modulates mediators on wnt- and receptor tyrosine kinase-pathways. by comparing mrna expression patterns from tgfβ1-differentiated epithelial cells and mesenchymal cell soluble factor differentiated epithelial cells the differentiation induced by tgfβ <dig> might be more potent than the differentiation induced by mesenchymal cells. this study indicates that this three-dimensional epithelial cell differentiation is a suitable tool in studying regulatory mechanisms during differentiation in intestine. in conclusion the present results would indicate that our model is a good tool for finding new players acting in the differentiation of epithelial cells.
