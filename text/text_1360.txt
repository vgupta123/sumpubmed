BACKGROUND
the past decades have witnessed many biological and epidemiological discoveries through the experimental design of genetic association studies based on the development of biological technology. many variants have been identified to be associated with the quantitative traits. for example, in studying genetic loci in association with various phenotypes,  <dig> were reported to be associated with human height  <cit> ,  <dig> were associated with age at menarche  <cit> ,  <dig> were identified to be associated with body mass index  <cit> , and the single-nucleotide polymorphism  rs <dig> was associated with both diastolic and systolic blood pressure levels  <cit> . a standard approach to conduct an association test in a quantitative trait genetic study is to fit a linear model based on the assumption that the original or transformed trait values follow a normal distribution. however, the normal assumption is often violated for many traits even though some transformations such as the log-transformation are carried out. for example, the number of tumors per subject in mouse follows a negative binomial distribution  <cit>  and the survival time of a person follows a truncated distribution  <cit> . a good alternative to address this issue is to use the nonparametric tests.

although there are various nonparametric tests in the literature, the most commonly used ones in genetic studies are the kruskal-wallis test   <cit>  and the jonckheere-tepstra test   <cit> . originally, the kw was designed to detect the differences of the response variable in the medians of three groups and it was a nonparametric version of one-way analysis of variance based on ranking. the jt was also a rank-based test for an ordered alternative hypothesis which was particularly sensitive to the genetic mode of inheritance. recently, zhang and li  <cit>  defined the nonparametric risk and nonparametric odds and proposed a nonparametric trend test  that has been shown to be more powerful than kw and jt under a given genetic model. these methods, however, would suffer from loss of power when the underlying genetic model is misspecified.

in the present paper, we propose a two-phase robust procedure to test the genetic-phenotypic association. we first construct a test to classify the genetic model in a nonparametric way. we find that the test statistic tends to be positive when the genetic model is dominant, and negative when the model is recessive. then based on the chosen model, the association test is conducted. we derive the correlation coefficient of the test used for choosing the genetic model and that for doing association study and obtain the proper size for a given nominal significance level. extensive simulation studies are conducted to show the new approach to have empirical size less than the nominal level, and to compare this new approach with kw and max <dig>  the maximum value of three npts. the results show that the proposed two-phase procedure is more robust than max <dig> and kw in the sense that its minimum power in a set of plausible models is the highest among the tests under consideration. finally, a real data analysis is used for further illustration.

methods
notations and genetic models
consider a biallelic marker whose genotype is coded as  <dig> , and  <dig>  corresponding to the count of a certain candidate risk allele or a minor allele. suppose that there are n subjects that are independently sampled from a source population in a quantitative trait genetic association study. let ,i= <dig> ,⋯,n be the observed sample, where yi is the trait value and gi denotes the genotype value of the ith subject, i= <dig> ,⋯,n. for brevity, let the first n <dig> subjects have genotype  <dig>  the second n <dig> subjects have genotype  <dig>  and the last n <dig> subjects possess genotype  <dig>  denote fij=pr,i,j= <dig> , <dig>  where y <dig> y <dig> and y <dig> are the random variables that take values in three sets {y <dig> y <dig> ⋯,yn0}, {yn0+ <dig> yn0+ <dig> ⋯,yn0+n1} and {yn0+n1+ <dig> yn0+n1+ <dig> ⋯,yn}, respectively. the null hypothesis of no association is given by h0:f01=f02=1/ <dig>  the alternative hypothesis is h1:f02≥f01≥1/ <dig> and f02>1/ <dig> 

a genetic model specifies the mode of inheritance. the three genetic models are: recessive model  if f01=1/ <dig> and f12=f02>1/ <dig>  additive model  if f01=f12>1/ <dig> and f02>1/ <dig>  and dominant model  if f01=f02> <dig> and f12=1/ <dig> 

model selection
denote Δ1=f01−1/ <dig>  Δ2=f12−1/ <dig>  we find that Δ1−Δ <dig> tends to be negative value under the recessive model and take positive under the dominant model. the signs of  under the three genetic models are plotted in fig.  <dig>  where the line corresponding to the additive model is the straight line with a slope of  <dig> at the point c, c=τ and τ denotes the transpose of a vector or a matrix, and the other two lines are for the recessive and dominant models, respectively. the recessive and dominant models form the boundaries of the space under the alternative hypothesis. the vertex c corresponds to the null hypothesis. denote 
 f^01=1n0n1∑i=1n0∑j=n0+1n0+n1i,f^12=1n1n2∑j=n0+1n0+n1∑k=n0+n1+1ni,σ^012=n1−1n02n1∑i=1n01n1∑j=n0+1n0+n1i−1/22+n0−1n0n12∑j=n0+1n0+n11n0∑i=1n0i−1/22+14n0n <dig> σ^ <dig> =1n12∑j=n0+1n0+n11n0∑i=1n0i−1/21n2∑k=n0+n1+1ni−1/ <dig>   and 
 σ^122=n2−1n12n2∑j=n0+1n0+n11n2∑k=n0+n1+1ni−1/22+n1−1n1n22∑k=n0+n1+1n1n1∑j=n0+1n0+n1i−1/22+14n1n <dig>  fig.  <dig> the common three genetic models in the genetic model space. the point c= corresponds to the null hypothesis



then f^ <dig> and f^ <dig> are the consistent estimators of f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively, σ^ <dig> and σ^ <dig> are, respectively, the consistent estimators of the variances of f^ <dig> and f^ <dig>  and σ^ <dig>  is the consistent estimator of the covariance between f^ <dig> and f^ <dig>  define a test statistic for genetic model selection as 
 z1=f^01−f^12σ^012−2σ^ <dig> +σ^ <dig>  

under the null hypothesis, z <dig> asymptotically follows the standard normal distribution. so the genetic models can be determined as follows: i) if z1>ξ , then the genetic model is dominant; ii) if z1<−ξ, then the genetic model is recessive; otherwise, the additive model is claimed. here, ξ is set to be the  <dig> % quantile of the standard normal distribution.

the nonparametric test under a given genetic model
denote 
 f^02=1n0n2∑i=1n0∑k=n0+n1+1ni,f^r=1n2∑i=1n0+n1∑k=n0+n1+1ni{yi<yk}=n0n0+n1f^02+n1n0+n1f^ <dig> σ^022=n2−1n02n2∑i=1n01n2∑k=n0+n1+1ni−1/22+n0−1n0n22∑k=n0+n1+1n1n0∑i=1n0i−1/22+14n0n <dig> σ^ <dig> =1n22∑k=n0+n1+1n1n0∑i=1n0i−1/21n1∑j=n0+1n0+n1i−1/ <dig>   and 
 σ^r2=n022σ^022+2n0n12σ^ <dig> +n122σ^ <dig>  

then the npt under the recessive model can be given by zr=/σ^r.

let 
 f^01=1n0n1∑i=1n0∑j=n0+1n0+n1i,w1∗=σ^ <dig> w2∗=σ^ <dig> w1=w1∗w1∗+w2∗,w2=w2∗w1∗+w2∗  and 
 f^a=w1f^01+w2f^ <dig> σ^a2=w12σ^012+2w1w2σ^ <dig> +w22σ^ <dig>  

then, the npt under the additive genetic model is za=/σ^a.

similarly, denote 
 σ^012=n1−1n02n1∑i=1n01n1∑j=n0+1n0+n1i−1/22+n0−1n0n12∑j=n0+1n0+n11n0∑i=1n0i−1/22+14n0n <dig> σ^ <dig> =1n02∑i=1n01n1∑j=n0+1n0+n1i−1/21n2∑k=n0+n1+1ni−1/ <dig> f^d=1n0∑i=1n0∑j=n0+1ni{yi<yj}=n1n1+n2f^01+n2n1+n2f^ <dig>   and 
 σ^d2=n122σ^012+2n1n22σ^ <dig> +n222σ^ <dig>  

then the npt under the dominant model is zd=/σ^d. under the null hypothesis, zr, za and zd follow the standard normal distribution.

two-phase procedure
we propose a two-phase procedure  for the quantitative trait association study by first determining the underlying genetic model in the first phase, followed by testing the association with the corresponding npt for the selected model in the second phase. in details, the two-phase procedure can be described by the following two steps:

step  <dig>  determine the genetic model using z <dig>  if z1<−ξ, the recessive model is used, else if z1>ξ, we use the dominant model, otherwise, the additive model is used.

step  <dig>  we choose the association test statistic based on the chosen model in step  <dig> and do the association study.

size adjustment
to adjust the size of the two-phase procedure for a given overall nominal significance level, we need to derive the joint distribution of z <dig> and zx, x∈{r,a,d}. from the additional file  <dig>  under the null hypothesis, τ asymptotically follows a bivariate normal distribution with mean  and Λx, where 
 Λx=1ρxρx <dig> x∈{r,a,d}. 

denote the cumulative distribution function of y <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> by f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively. then ρr, ρa and ρd are functions of f <dig> f <dig> f <dig> and p , which can be estimated empirically based on the observed data. the consistent estimates can be obtained under the situation that the means of the trait values in the groups with different genotypes being equal. the technical details of derivations for ρr, ρa and ρd under the null hypothesis are presented in the additional file  <dig>  suppose that the null hypothesis is rejected at the level of α∗ in the second phase. then, to control the overall level at a given α, we have α=ph0z1<−ξ,|zr|>z+ph0|z1|<ξ,|za|>z+ph0z1>ξ,|zd|>z, where z is the α quantile of the standard normal distribution. so, this relation can be written as 
 α=∫ΩrΦ−z−ρru1/2+Φ−z+ρru1/2dΦ+∫ΩaΦ−z−ρau1/2+Φ−z+ρau1/2dΦ+∫ΩdΦ−z−ρdu1/2+Φ−z+ρdu1/2dΦ,  where Ωr={u:u<−ξ}, Ωa={u:−ξ≤u≤ξ}, Ωd={u:u>ξ}, and Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. under the null hypothesis, we can numerically calculate the adjusted significant level for the association test statistic in the second phase. table  <dig> shows the mean and standard error of α∗ with the nominal level of  <dig>  and  <dig>  based on  <dig>  and  <dig>  replicates, respectively. it indicates that α∗ is more likely to be smaller than α, and also α∗ is less vulnerable to the maf. for example, when maf= <dig> , the adjusted levels for the nominal α= <dig>  and α= <dig>  are  <dig>  and  <dig> , and the corresponding standard error are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.


RESULTS
the performance of model selection procedure
we conduct simulation studies to explore the performance of the model selection procedure. we generate data considering three genetic models. consider the linear model y=β0+gβ1+ε, where y denotes the phenotype value, g denotes the genotype value at a snp locus, and ε follows a truncated generalized extreme value distribution ) with the shape parameter  <dig>  the location parameter  <dig>  the scale parameter d, and the truncated point  <dig>  here we specify β0= <dig> , β1= <dig> , d= <dig>  and the maf p∈{ <dig> , <dig> ,⋯, <dig> }. the total sample size is  <dig> .  <dig>  replicates are conducted to compute the true selection rate  under different scenarios. table  <dig> shows the results for ξ=Φ−1= <dig> . the other results for ξ=Φ−1= <dig> , ξ=Φ−1= <dig>  and Φ−1= <dig>  are given in the additional file  <dig>  from table  <dig>  we can see that the tsr increases as maf increases. for example, if the recessive model is true, the tsr is  <dig>  % for maf of  <dig> , while it is  <dig>  % for maf of  <dig> . it makes sense since the expected number of subjects with genotype  <dig> is increasing with the maf increasing. we also find that the tsr for additive model is satisfactory with the tsr being around  <dig> %. for example, the tsr are  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % corresponding to maf of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. besides this, we also conduct simulations with covariates considering y=β0+xγ+gβ1+ε, where x is a covariate. the detailed results are available in the additional file  <dig>  with ξ=Φ

type i error rate
we evaluate the empirical type i error rates of five tests: kw, zr, za, max <dig>  and tpp. the simulation settings are similar as above. the sample size is  <dig> . here we use ξ=Φ− <dig>  β0= <dig> , and p∈{ <dig> , <dig> ,⋯, <dig> }.  <dig>  replicates are conducted for the nominal significant level of  <dig>  and  <dig>  replicates are conducted for the nominal significant level of  <dig> . table  <dig> shows the empirical type i errors of the five tests under the significant level of  <dig>  and  <dig> . the results show that all of the five tests could control the type i error correctly with the empirical values being close to the nominal significance level. for example, when maf = <dig> , the empirical type i error rates of kw, zr, za, max <dig>  and tpp test are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, under the significant level of  <dig> . when maf = <dig>  and the nominal significant level is  <dig> , the empirical type i error rates of kw, zr, za, max <dig>  and tpp test are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.r, z

power
we compare the power among kw, zr, za, max <dig> and tpp under the similar settings to those described above. figures  <dig> and  <dig> report the power results for the nominal level of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, under the recessive, additive, and dominant models. in order to make the power comparable, when the nominal level is  <dig> , we specify d= <dig> for β1= <dig>  and d= <dig> for β1= <dig> , and when the nominal level is  <dig> , we set d= <dig> and β1={ <dig> , <dig> }. the results indicate that, except the npt test under the true genetic model, the proposed tpp is always more powerful than kw and max <dig>  this makes sense because that npt under a given model  is the most powerful under that model, and the model selection procedure always gives a large probability of tsr. tpp is more powerful than kw, za, and max <dig> under the recessive model and in most scenarios under the dominant model. in some cases, there are  <dig> % power increase. for example, when maf is  <dig> , β1= <dig> , α= <dig>  and the genetic model is recessive, the empirical powers of kw, za, max <dig>  and tpp are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. the performance of tpp is superior than the other three test kw, zr and max <dig> when the true model is additive or dominant. for example, when maf is  <dig>  and the genetic model is additive, β1= <dig> , α= <dig> , the empirical powers of kw, zr, max <dig>  and tpp are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. furthermore, using zr under the additive or dominant model can result in substantial loss of power. the tpp has higher robustness against the genetic model than other four tests. for example, when α= <dig>  and β1= <dig> , the minimum value of power for tpp over maf from  <dig>  to  <dig>  is  <dig>  under the recessive, additive and dominant model, which is larger than those of kw , zr , za , and max <dig> .

application to gene dnah <dig> associated with anti-ccp measure
we apply kw, za, max <dig> and tpp to identify the deleterious snps in the gene dnah <dig>  <cit>  for the association with the anti-ccp measure using the data from genetic workshop  <dig>  <cit> . the anti-ccp is present in the blood of the majority of patients with rheumatoid arthritis . the data includes  <dig> cases  and  <dig>  controls . here we impute them with the minimum value of the anti-ccp values in cases, which is  <dig>  following zheng et al.  <cit> . we remove the effect of population stratification using four principal coordinates  <cit>  following zhang and li  <cit>  and take the residuals as the new outcome. there are  <dig> snps in gene dnah <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  we calculate the p-values of these snps using the kw, za, max <dig> and tpp approaches. there are six snps in gene dnah <dig> whose proportions of the missing genotype value are more than  <dig> %, so we only show the p-value of the remaining  <dig> snps. in the main text, we shows the results of the snps whose p-values are relatively small  in table  <dig> and the p-values of the other snps are summarized in table s <dig> in the additional file  <dig>  we find that the snp rs <dig> has the minimum p-value of  <dig> ×10− <dig> using the tpp. the corresponding p-values using kw, za, and max <dig> are  <dig> ×10− <dig>   <dig> ×10− <dig> and  <dig> ×10− <dig>  respectively. burton et al. <cit>  proposed to use the p-value threshold of 5×10− <dig> as the moderate association at the genome-wide level. because the p-values of kw, za and max are all larger than 5×10− <dig>  there are no moderate genome-wide associations. however, for the tpp, we calculate the adjusted p-value threshold for 5×10− <dig> and it is  <dig> ×10− <dig>  this indicates that using the tpp can give the moderate-strong effect.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
with the developments of biological technology, more and more data on quantitative traits and genotypes are generated and deposited in public database such as the national center for biotechnology information database. it is urgent to develop new methods to excavate useful information to help understand the etiology of human complex diseases. a nonparametric two-phase procedure is proposed here to test the association between a di-allelic snp and a non-normal distributed quantitative trait when the genetic model is unknown. simulation results show that the proposed tpp is more robust than the existing methods.

if there are covariates needed to be adjusted for, we can first regress on the covariates and use the residuals as the new outcome and then employ tpp to conduct the association study. the detailed simulation results are presented in additional file  <dig>  besides the truncated generalized extreme value distributional  error term with the truncation point  <dig>  we also consider the error term following the centralized t distribution and general generalized extreme value distribution, respectively. the results are given in additional file  <dig>  where the similar results are observed.
