BACKGROUND
small rnas play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes  <cit> . they are known to be involved in various aspects of genome stability, development, and response to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . small rnas regulate gene expression by modulating mrna degradation, translational repression, and chromatin modification  <cit> . according to their origin or function in plants, these small rnas are classified as micrornas , natural antisense transcript  small interfering rnas , trans-acting short interfering rnas, heterochromatic sirnas, and long small interfering rnas   <cit> .

nats are a class of endogenous rnas that have sequences partially, or completely, complementary to each other  <cit> . based on their origin, nats can be classified as either cis or trans. cis-nats are formed from sense and antisense transcript that is transcribed from the same genomic loci, whereas trans-nats have sense and antisense transcripts derived from different genomic loci  <cit> . nats form double-stranded rna  molecules with complementary sequences, and these dsrnas are processed by dicer-like proteins to generate nat-sirnas  <cit> . these nat-sirnas can be incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex  and act to guide the cleavage of complementary transcripts  <cit> . a transcript may form more than one trans-nat with multiple antisense transcripts. these antisense transcripts can also form a trans-nat with other transcripts. this process demonstrates the complexity of nat involvement in the regulatory networks at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . nats are involved in numerous biological processes in plants. the expression of nat genes can be tissue-specific, and many nats are formed in response to environmental stimuli  <cit> . several nat-sirnas play roles in salt stress, bacterial resistance, cell wall biosynthesis, and fertilization in plants  <cit> .

nats are widespread in plant cells. in rice ,  <dig> % of genes exhibit antisense expression  <cit> . in arabidopsis, more than 30% of the genome produces transcripts from both strands, and 25% of genes have antisense expression  <cit> . in bread wheat , serial analysis of gene expression using tags revealed that  <dig> % of unique genes exhibit antisense transcription  <cit> . based on full-length cdna and genomic data,  <dig>  cis-nats and  <dig>  trans-nats were predicted and identified in arabidopsis <cit> . in rice,  <dig> cis-nats and  <dig>  trans-nats were identified to be formed by protein-coding genes  <cit> . the use of high-throughput sequencing data for small rnas allowed the construction of a plant nat database  containing approximately two million nats from  <dig> different plant species  <cit> . nats and other small rnas are annotated in the plantnatsdb based on gene ontology categories . a total of  <dig>  genes in the plantnatsdb were used to predict  <dig> cis-nats and  <dig>  trans-nats in soybean . however, the details for the soybean nats remain to be determined.

here, we report the prediction of  <dig> cis-nats and  <dig>  trans-nats based on  <dig>  soybean transcripts downloaded from the phytozome database   <cit> . a total of  <dig> trans-nats were identified by rt-pcr amplification. in all,  <dig>  small rnas,  <dig>  of which were unique, were derived from  <dig> nats. these small rnas were found to be enriched in the overlapping regions of nats. the use of deep sequencing of the degradome is broadly applicable for global identification of small rna targets  <cit> . analyses of the soybean degradome database  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes as the targets of  <dig> nat-sirnas in soybean. furthermore, we detected five trans-nat transcripts that can be folded into the stem-loop structures that are characteristic of pre-mirnas, and identified  <dig> targets of soybean mirna that contained antisense transcripts in soybean.

RESULTS
prediction of nats in soybean
we analyzed  <dig>  soybean transcripts downloaded from the phytozome database   <cit> . over 13%  of the transcripts had at least one antisense transcript in soybean. among these transcripts, over 50%  had only one antisense transcript, while the others had from  <dig> to  <dig> antisense transcripts . a total of  <dig>  nats were identified in soybean. the nats were categorized into cis-nats and trans-nats according to the transcript origin from the genomic loci. mapping of the nat transcripts to the soybean genome identified  <dig> cis-nats and  <dig>  trans-nats .

cis-nats and trans-nats in soybean
the cis-nats can be classified into three types: convergent ; divergent ; and enclosed   <cit> . among the  <dig> soybean cis-nats,  <dig> were arranged in the enclosed orientation;  <dig> were convergent; and  <dig> were divergent . in contrast, most of the cis-nats from arabidopsis and rice are convergent  <cit> .

cis-nat overlaps length are usually longer than trans-nat overlaps length  <cit> , and this was also true for soybean nats. the cis-nat overlaps length ranged from 31– <dig>  bp , whereas the trans-nat overlaps length ranged from 31– <dig>  bp . the overlapping length of the majority of trans-nats  was shorter than  <dig> bp, and only  <dig> % were longer than  <dig> bp .

many transcripts have multiple antisense transcripts in plant. for the cis-nats, several genes are involved in two cis-nats in arabidopsis <cit> . in soybean, we identified  <dig> transcripts that formed two or more cis-nats with other transcripts . glyma13g <dig>  and glyma13g <dig>  had ten and three antisense transcripts respectively. the large genomic sequence sizes of glyma13g <dig>   and glyma13g <dig>   may help to explain the reason they contained multiple antisense transcripts.

1the types of cis-nat were categorized as enclosed , convergent , or divergent .

for the trans-nats, one transcript commonly had many antisense transcripts  <cit> . the number of antisense transcripts ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in soybean, possibly a consequence of the homologous genes in the gene families frequently having the same antisense transcript  <cit> . the soybean genome has gone through at least two rounds of polyploidy and subsequent diploidization events. segmental duplications and chromosome-level homology are common in the soybean genome  <cit> , and approximately 75% of genes have multiple copies  <cit> . some transcripts can form both cis-nats and trans-nats  <cit> . of the  <dig>  transcripts in soybean,  <dig>  transcripts were involved in both cis- and trans-nats . these genes may be regulated by cis- and/or trans-nats.

identification of nats in soybean
we identified  <dig> transcripts using rt-pcr amplification. these  <dig> transcripts can form  <dig> trans-nats. one transcript may form nats with multiple antisense transcripts  <cit> . we identified glyma01g <dig> , glyma04g <dig>  and glyma08g <dig>  as having the same five antisense transcripts. the overlapping region in the sense transcripts had similar sequences . glyma14g <dig>  can form nats with glyma02g <dig> , glyma10g <dig> , glyma14g <dig> , glyma18g <dig> , glyma14g <dig>  and glyma20g <dig> . the overlapping region of glyma02g <dig> , glyma10g <dig> , glyma18g <dig>  and glyma14g <dig>  had the same sequences, while glyma20g <dig>  can form nat at another location on the glyma14g <dig>  transcript.

small rnas originating from nats
as nats can generate small rnas  <cit>  we searched for the presence of small rnas in our library for the  <dig>  transcripts. we identified  <dig>  transcripts able to give rise to small rnas.  <dig>  small rna sequences, representing  <dig>  unique small rnas, were generated from these transcripts. the most abundant unique small rnas were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nt in length . in soybean, these  <dig>  transcripts could form  <dig> cis-nats and  <dig>  trans-nats .

most of the small rnas were derived from one of the nat transcripts in arabidopsis <cit> . both cis- and trans-nats mostly generated small rnas from one strand of the nat in soybean . among the cis-nats,  <dig> %  generated small rnas from only one strand of the nat, and  <dig> %  generated small rnas equally from both transcripts. for the trans-nats,  <dig> %  generated small rnas from only one strand, and  <dig> %  generated small rna equally from both strands.

small rnas originated from both the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of nats  <cit> . the distribution of small rnas in these two regions varies in different plants  <cit> . in soybean, the average densities  of the unique and total small rnas in the overlapping regions were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the entire nats. t-tests for the unique  and total  small rnas suggested that both were enriched in the overlapping region.

the nats degradome in soybean
nats can produce small rnas, which suggests that these transcripts are excised by dicer-like proteins. we searched for the degradome tags of the  <dig>  nats that could produce small rnas. a total of  <dig> cis-nat and  <dig>  trans-nat transcripts were identified as having degradomes . most degradome tags were derived from one nat transcript :  <dig> %  cis-nats, and  <dig> %  trans-nats, generated tags from only one transcript. this was consistent with the small rna bias towards one strand of nats.

identification of nat-derived small rna targets in soybean
nat-sirna can regulate gene expression by guiding target mrna degradation at the posttranscriptional level  <cit> . the targets of sirnas can be globally identified by analyzing the degradome  <cit> . we searched the nat-sirna targets by analyzing the soybean degradome and identified  <dig> target genes for the  <dig> nat-sirnas . of these  <dig> nat-sirnas,  <dig> were derived from trans-nats,  <dig> from cis- or trans-nats, and only one was generated from a cis-nat. regarding the  <dig> target genes,  <dig> were targeted by a nat-sirna derived from the corresponding nat sense strand, and  <dig> were targeted by a nat-sirna produced from the corresponding antisense strand. the nat-sirnas targets not only the transcript of their own nats but also that of other transcripts. a total of  <dig> genes were identified as targets of nat-sirnas, these nat-sirnas were not produced from target sense or antisense transcripts.

mirnas may be involved in the formation of nats in soybean
some nats can form stem-loop structures and generate mature mirnas. in rice, some mirnas are derived from the overlapping transcript antisense of mads box transcripts, and act to guide mads transcript cleavage  <cit> . we used the unafold program to simulate folding of  <dig>  transcripts identified as being able to produce small rnas  <cit> . five transcripts were predicted to contain a stem-loop structure characteristic of pre-mirna . these transcripts were glyma02g <dig> , glyma04g <dig> , glyma05g <dig> , glyma05g <dig> , and glyma05g <dig> . further analysis revealed that glyma04g <dig>  and glyma05g <dig>  were mir <dig> genes; glyma05g <dig>  produced mir319; and glyma02g <dig>  and glyma05g <dig>  generated small rnas randomly from both sense and antisense strands . these five genes may be involved in the biogenesis of both mirnas and nats. there are two possible pathways by which mirnas could be generated from these transcripts. one pathway occurs when the sense and antisense transcripts are co-expressed in the same cell, form a double rna duplex, and produce nat-sirnas. this then guides the generation of small rnas from their sense or antisense transcripts  <cit> . another pathway occurs when the sense and antisense transcripts are not co-expressed in the same cell; these transcripts can fold into a hairpin and produce mirnas.

targets of mirnas may be involved in the formation of nats. we collected  <dig> candidate targets of mirnas and searched for targets that could form nats.  <dig> mirna targets were identified as having antisense transcripts . these targets could form cis- and trans-nats. analysis of the soybean degradome of these  <dig> targets validated  <dig> as being mirna targets  <cit> .

nats may form complex regulatory networks in soybean
it has been suggested that nats form complex regulatory networks in plants  <cit> . one transcript often has many antisense transcripts, and these can form nats with other transcripts. in soybean,  <dig>  transcripts were predicted to form both cis- and trans-nats .  <dig> transcripts had multiple cis-nats. soybean commonly has one transcript that has many antisense transcripts forming the trans-nats. of the  <dig>  transcripts that form nats,  <dig>  contain multiple  antisense transcripts .

the nat-sirnas play important roles in plant development. nats produce nat-sirnas via a process mediated by dicer-like rna-dependent rna polymerase and suppressor of gene silencing  <dig>  the nat-sirna is then incorporated into the risc and directs the cleavage of a complementary mrna  <cit> . with high-throughput sequences of small rnas from different soybean tissues, we detected  <dig>  nats that produced at least one small rna . these small rnas potentially regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. in recent years, deep sequencing of the degradome has been used extensively to globally identify small rna targets. analysis of the soybean degradome database enabled identification of  <dig> genes as targets of  <dig> nat-sirnas. these nat-sirnas targets included nat sense or antisense transcripts, and other transcripts .

mirnas and their targets may be involved in nat regulatory networks. five transcripts with pre-mirna stem-loop structures had antisense transcripts. these transcripts may generate nat-sirnas or mirnas; this is dependent on whether the transcripts are co-expressed with antisense transcripts in the same cell. furthermore, we detected  <dig> mirna targets that had antisense transcripts in soybean. these mirna targets might be regulated by their antisense transcripts.

nats may form complex regulatory networks in soybean . in these networks, gene expression is regulated by other genes forming cis- or trans-nats. nats can produce nat-sirnas that self-target their nat transcripts and other gene transcripts. some nats produce mirnas to regulate expression of other genes, and some mirnas guide the cleavage of nats.

CONCLUSIONS
we globally predicted nats in soybean and confirmed the identity of  <dig> trans-nats by rt-pcr. the use of high-throughput sequencing of the small rnas and degradome in soybean enabled the identification of  <dig>  unique nat-derived small rnas, and  <dig> targets of  <dig> nat-sirnas. the identification of these nat-sirna targets can help to determine the function of nat-sirnas in soybean. furthermore, we identified five pre-mirnas, and  <dig> mirna targets that contained antisense transcripts. nats, nat-derived small rnas, nat-sirna targets, nat-related pre-mirnas, and nat-related mirna targets, may form complex regulatory networks. it follows that an understanding of these networks will further our understanding of the roles that nats play in soybean development.
