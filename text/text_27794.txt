BACKGROUND
gastric ulceration is commonly identified in horses and foals. the prevalence of gastric ulcers in thoroughbred racehorses is estimated to be >80 % in the squamous mucosa  <cit> . in weanlings it ranges between  <dig> and 94 %  <cit> . risk factors for gastric mucosa lesions, specifically for equine squamous gastric ulcer disease, are stall confinement, strenuous exercise, transport stress in adult horses , and the weaning process in foals  <cit> . nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been demonstrated to be a risk factor for the equine glandular region in adult horses and foals  <cit> .

the relationship between feeding and gastric mucosal health has been demonstrated. dietary factors that may effect squamous gastric mucosa in horses include buffering substances  <cit> , the level of starch intake  <cit> , or the type and daily amount of food  <cit> . furthermore, the particle size of the diet appears to be a factor in glandular gastric mucosa  <cit> . in foals, feeding alfalfa chaff resulted in glandular mucosal lesions, which may have been related to mechanical irritation  <cit> . furthermore, no favorable effect was found on the squamous mucosa in weanlings. however, other authors observed beneficial effects of feeding alfalfa hay on the squamous mucosa in foals  <cit>  and adult horses  <cit> . in pigs fed a diet of finely ground pellets, the squamous gastric ulcer score was significantly higher than for those fed a diet of larger particles  <cit> . furthermore, feeding a coarse ground feed reduced mucosa lesions of the pars oesophagea in growing pigs  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of feeding two alfalfa preparations with different particle sizes  in comparison with grass hay on the gastric mucosa in weanling horses. we hypothesized that feeding a high proportion of fine particles  would negatively impact gastric mucosa in foals and that foals receiving alfalfa chaff would have better gastric mucosal lesion scores.

RESULTS
none of the foals in the study demonstrated any clinical signs commonly associated with the presence of gastric ulcers such as colic, inappetence, or depression, as reviewed by andrews and others  <cit> .

the daily average consumption of grass hay per foal was  <dig>  kg in the alfalfa chaff group,  <dig>  kg in the alfalfa pellets group, and  <dig>  kg in the grass hay group . in addition to the grass hay intake, the mean daily feed intake  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg in the alfalfa chaff group,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg in the alfalfa pellets group, and  <dig>  kg in the hay group.table  <dig> mean  daily dry matter and nutrient intake for each foal according to diet

effect of weaning on gastric mucosa
only very few foals had gastric mucosa lesions in the dorsal squamous fundus before and after weaning in the three diet groups. in the squamous region of the greater curvature, the median lesion score was  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the hay group ,  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa chaff group , and  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa pellets group  . in the squamous region of the lesser curvature, the median lesion score increased from  <dig>  before to  <dig>  after weaning in the hay group , increased from  <dig>  before to  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa chaff group , and was  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa pellets group  .

in the glandular region of the greater curvature, the median lesion score was  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the hay group ,  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa chaff group , and  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa pellets group  . in the antrum, the median lesion score was  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the hay group ,  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa chaff group , and  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa pellets group  . at the pylorus, the median lesion score was  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the hay group ,  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa chaff group , and  <dig>  before and  <dig>  after weaning in the alfalfa pellets group  .

effect of diet on gastric mucosa
before weaning , the gastroscopic findings of each region did not differ significantly between the three diet groups . after weaning , gastric mucosal lesions at the pylorus were significantly more severe in the group fed alfalfa chaff  . in the other regions, no differences related to the feeding regimes were observed.

discussion
various methods have been used to induce gastric ulcers. in this study we used the weaning process as a model to induce gastric ulcers in foals to determine the effects of feeding. previous studies have shown that the weaning process is a stressful event in a foal’s life and may increase gastric lesions. dahlkamp and others  <cit>  reported that ulcer scores of the squamous region, as examined by gastroscopy, increased from 48 % before weaning to 78 % 2 weeks after weaning. this study revealed an initial prevalence of gastric lesions in glandular and squamous regions of  <dig>  % prior to weaning. the changes in feeding and housing management 1 week before weaning may have resulted in high gastric lesion scores. the introduction to new stables and housing groups was performed to ensure standardized experimental conditions.

the aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of feeding different particle sizes to weanlings. gastric findings of each region of the stomach were scored separately because we assumed that diet regime might have various influences on the gastric mucosa of different regions.

one food source recommended to prevent gastric lesions in horses is alfalfa hay. nadeau and others  <cit>  found a lower incidence of gastric lesions in horses fed alfalfa hay. the reason for the beneficial effects of feeding alfalfa is related to its buffering components, like protein and calcium. high calcium intake reduced the basal hcl secretion in rats. this effect was suspected to be a result of higher extracellular and intracellular calcium concentrations in parietal and g cells. higher extracellular and intracellular calcium concentrations may lower the camp concentration, thus reducing the production of hcl  <cit> . exposure of the equine gastric mucosa to hcl and short-chain fatty acids significantly decreased sodium transport of the cells. the addition of calcium carbonate decreased the sodium transport to baseline  <cit> . from these results, the authors proposed that calcium has a protective effect in the development of gastric lesions. nadeau and others  <cit>  found significantly lower scores of the squamous mucosa in horses fed an alfalfa hay/grain diet compared to horses fed a brome hay diet. the authors concluded that high amounts of protein and the quality of the protein may have buffering effects in the stomach, as previously seen in cattle  <cit> .

alfalfa is believed to have beneficial effects on gastric mucosa by buffering gastric ph because it contains large amounts of calcium, magnesium, and protein. in the present study, calcium and protein intake were approximately equal among the different feeding groups , but particle size between the two alfalfa preparations was different. former studies have demonstrated the impact of the particle size on the stomach mucosa in different species. saliva production is related to the particle structure of a diet, and saliva has a buffering effect due to its potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate  <cit> . for example, feeding 1 kg of hay results in  <dig> to 6 l of saliva production and feeding 1 kg of grain results in  <dig> to  <dig>  l of saliva production in adult horses  <cit> . the concentration of bicarbonate in saliva may impact stomach ph  <cit> . these effects may explain the lower gastric lesion scores in weanlings fed hay in our study. however, lesion scores of weanlings in the alfalfa pellets group were not significantly different from those in the hay group. it is possible that although the foals fed alfalfa pellets may have produced less saliva, the high-quality protein in the alfalfa may have resulted in ulcer scores similar to those in the hay group.

foals fed alfalfa chaff had higher ulcer scores at the pylorus than those fed alfalfa pellets or hay. these results were surprising because alfalfa chaff has been suggested to be associated with higher saliva production due to the more intensive chewing involved; increased saliva flow is known to have a buffering effect on the stomach. the findings in the alfalfa chaff group were similar to those of fedtke and others  <cit> . these authors noted that feeding alfalfa chaff resulted in significantly greater ulcer scores at the pylorus following weaning. they speculated that the pyloric ulcers might be related to the small particles of the alfalfa chaff, similar to results obtained in swine  <cit> . mößeler and others  <cit>  fed pigs four different diets with different grinding intensities and different physical forms  for 3 days. animals were examined post-mortem. samples of the frozen gastric contents were taken from  <dig> standardized locations of the stomach. mößeler and others  <cit>  demonstrated that a finely ground pellet diet resulted in more liquid gastric contents and that ph values were similar in all regions of the stomach . in contrast, a coarsely ground diet resulted in stratification of the gastric chyme content, with a ph difference of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . in the squamous region, the gastric ulcers score was significantly higher in pigs fed a finely ground pellet diet in comparison with pigs fed a coarsely ground diet without pellets  <cit> . all studies performed on pigs focused on the squamous region, which is the most common region for development of gastric ulceration in pigs  <cit> . pigs fed a diet of finely ground pellets also showed greater histological evidence of inflammation compared to pigs fed other diets  <cit> .

however, our results differed from those noted in pigs. higher ulcer scores were observed after feeding alfalfa chaff compared to hay or alfalfa pellets. in our study alfalfa pellets with a particle size smaller than 1 mm did not induce pyloric lesions. this might be due to the fact that all foals in our study had free access to hay and straw bedding as sources of food. this factor may have masked the negative effects of fine particles in the diet. however, due to the large sample size number, we could not provide individual feeding, but due to the very close monitoring of the foals, we can ensure a similar feed intake within the groups and between the different diets.

it is possible that the harsh acanthous structure of alfalfa chaff may cause mechanical injury at the pylorus. the pyloric region is an area of the stomach with high motility. we assume that the movement of the alfalfa stems may excoriate the mucosa during passage. this initial injury of the glandular mucosa might leave the pylorus more vulnerable to the insults of short-chain fatty acids, hydrochloric acid, and/or bile salts. pyloric lesions are of particular clinical concern because damage to the pylorus may result in pyloric stenosis with delayed gastric emptying  <cit> . however, further studies are required to determine whether feeding the whole alfalfa plant may result in similar findings.

CONCLUSIONS
foals fed alfalfa chaff had higher lesion scores at the pylorus. these findings stress the importance of scoring all gastric regions separately. furthermore, in the past, particle size has been neglected in equine nutrition; however, our data seem to show this might be an issue in the occurrence of pyloric lesions. it remains unclear whether the mucosa injuries can be observed only in weanlings during the stressful weaning process as a result of impaired mucosal defence or whether the damage can also be induced in adult horses. nevertheless, alfalfa leaves contain a superior protein source and high amounts of calcium and magnesium  <cit> , providing extra nutritional advantages in growing horses. at this time, either traditional grass hay rations or grass hay with alfalfa pellets can be recommended.
