BACKGROUND
anthonomus grandis , commonly known as the cotton boll weevil, is the most harmful cotton-feeding insect-pest in the americas  <cit> . even in cotton fields where the insect has been considered eradicated , the growers must maintain a continued vigil because of the tremendous ability of the boll weevil to return to previous controlled regions from time to time to re-infest. millions of dollars in insecticides were spent by growers to have areas eradicated. in not eradicated areas, yield losses to boll weevil exceeded until  <dig> percent in certain years and the growers had to apply 8- <dig> boll weevil sprays per field  <cit> . these repeated treatments are necessary, because only adult boll weevils feed on tender cotton terminals, on pollen from flower buds and on fruits. the larvae are protected inside the boll, which makes difficult the contact with chemical pesticides. recently presented during forum brazil' 2010/ <dig>  cotton area production is estimated at  <dig>  million of hectares the highest since the early 1990's  <cit> . however, especially in brazil, boll weevil is considered a key pest in cotton fields and despite of pest management and several insecticide sprays, an efficient boll weevil control does not exist. as an alternative to chemicals, the use of transgenic plants resistant to a. grandis presents a potential solution to the problem posed by insect-pests  <cit> . the development of genetically modified  crops expressing cry toxins has been widely researched due to the toxic effect of these molecules against insect-pests  and nematodes which attack and thereby affect the productivity of crops such as cotton  <cit> . these toxins are harmless to vertebrates and plants due their high specificity to the insect target. since  <dig>  several insect-resistant gm cotton events have been used commercially throughout the world, including bollgard®  and bollgard ii®  from monsanto, widestrike®  from dow agrosciences and vipcot®  from syngenta/deltapines. this technology has been used to control lepidopterans, allowing an increase in productivity, reductions in production costs, human intoxication and environmental damage due to a reduction in chemical pesticide application  <cit> . at the moment, however, none of the commercially available gm cotton events are effective against the cotton boll weevil, which is the most harmful cotton insect-pest in latin america. cry proteins are included in parasporal crystalline structures produced by bacillus thuringiensis during sporulation  <cit> . several hypothesis about the insecticidal mechanism of action of cry toxins have been discussed in previous studies  <cit> , including the pore formation model  <cit>  and the signal transduction model  <cit> . more recently, guo et al  <cit>  proposed a plausible model for the initiation of cry toxin domain disassembly before membrane penetration and pore formation. after ingestion, the crystals are solubilised and activated by insect midgut proteases. according to bravo and soberon  <cit> , the binding of toxins to specific cadherin-like receptors triggers the oligomerization of toxin monomers. directed by an aminopeptidase-n receptor, the oligomer is inserted into the cell membrane and forms a pore. those pores are responsible for a net influx of ions and water, leading to disturbances in osmotic balance, cell lysis, midgut damage and insect death  <cit> . in the intracellular signalling model  <cit> , the binding of toxins to the cadherin-like receptor triggers an mg2+-dependent camp signalling pathway that promotes cell death. in both models, the affinity for cadherin receptors has been reported as the main step that determines specificity. mutations in those receptors have been reported to be the cause of resistance acquisition  <cit> . moreover, broderick et al  <cit>  suggested that the cry toxin activity is also dependent on the microorganisms of the insect midgut. molecular strategies that involve structural and biochemical studies of cry toxins, as well as the isolation and characterisation of new cry genes, are necessary to help elucidate the mechanisms of action of cry toxins and also to select molecules that have the potential for improved toxicity and specificity  <cit> .

in this context, dna shuffling, as described by stemmer  <cit>  and following modifications reported by zhao and arnold  <cit> , is the most commonly used technique to promote in vitro directed molecular evolution. in this technique, the introduction of random mutations into the nucleotide sequences results in a pool of mutants from which proteins with improved function can be selected. considering the biotechnological context, this technique has been used as a tool to generate libraries that contain variant genes encoding engineered proteins, which can subsequently be selected according to their potential agricultural or pharmaceutical use  <cit> . in a previous study reported by our group, a recombinant toxin produced by the cry1ia <dig> gene exhibited moderate toxicity towards first instar larvae from both the lepidopteran fall armyworm   and the coleopteran cotton boll weevil   <cit> . more recently, cry1ia12synth  was used in an approach applying dna shuffling coupled with the phage display technique, which involves the presentation of peptide and protein libraries on the surface of phage particles for the facilitated selection of proteins with high affinity and specificity for a determined target  <cit> . our data showed that this strategy was able to efficiently generate genetic diversity, and the screening of the combinatorial library for cry1ia12synth variants resulted in the identification of novel molecules with improved entomotoxicity towards the sugarcane giant borer larvae, telchin licus licus , an activity not exhibited by the wild-type protein encoded by the original cry1ia <dig> gene  <cit> .

in a parallel manner, our team isolated a new gene classified as cry8ka <dig>  from a bt strain that showed moderate toxicity to the cotton boll weevil  <cit> . the entomotoxicity of recombinant cry8ka <dig> protein expressed in e. coli bioassayed against a. grandis larvae was confirmed  <cit> .

in the present study, the cry8ka <dig> gene was used in the combined dna shuffling and phage display techniques to create novel cry mutant toxins with improved activity towards the coleopteran a. grandis. around  <dig> cry8ka <dig> variants were generated, and the combinatorial library and screened phage selection allowed the isolation of new cry toxins that exhibit improved toxicity against the boll weevil insect-pest. among the screened cry variants, cry8ka <dig> was selected for its high toxicity and potential use as a biotechnology tool for the generation of transgenic cotton plants. analyses from theoretical models created for cry8ka <dig> and cry8ka <dig> toxin and comparison with other cry toxin structures revealed that essential structural features are conserved.

 <dig>  methods
 <dig>  preparation of a. grandis brush border membrane vesicles 
neonate a. grandis larvae were obtained from colonies grown at the embrapa genetic resources and biotechnology centre  using an artificial diet  <cit> . the bbmvs were prepared from midguts of boll weevil larvae by mg/egta precipitation and differential centrifugation  <cit> . the larval midguts were extracted and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube with met  containing  <dig> mm pmsf. two hundred midguts were centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at 4°c, and the pellet was washed twice with met buffer. the concentration of bbmvs proteins was determined by the bradford assay  <cit>  using bovine serum albumin  as the standard for the calibration curve. the aliquots were stored to -80°c until use.

 <dig>  cry8ka <dig> gene amplification
a cry8ka <dig> gene was previously isolated by our team from a collection of bacillus thuringiensis at the embrapa genetic resources and biotechnology  <cit>  was chosen for further studies because the encoded toxin had the potential to control the cotton boll weevil . first, the cry8ka <dig> gene , corresponding only to the active part of the toxin, was pcr-amplified from the original plasmid using platinum taq dna polymerase high fidelity  and the cry8ka1sfif  and cry8ka1sfir  primers, which introduced an sfi i restriction site . the pcr program included the following steps: a denaturation step, consisting of  <dig> cycle at 95°c for  <dig> min;  <dig> cycles consisting of a denaturation step of  <dig> s at 95°c; a hybridisation step of  <dig> s at 45°c; an elongation step of  <dig> s at 72°c; and finally, a step consisting of  <dig> min at 72°c. the pcr amplification product was analysed by 1% agarose  gel electrophoresis, and the dna  was excised and gel-purified using the geneclean® ii kit .

 <dig>  generation of a combinatorial library using dna shuffling and phage display
the sfi i-digested, pcr-amplified cry8ka <dig> gene was used as the starting material for the dna-shuffling procedure  <cit> . first,  <dig> μg of the purified cry8ka <dig> gene was randomly digested in a mixture containing  <dig> u of dnase i enzyme  in dnase i buffer . the digestion reaction was performed at 15°c for  <dig> min and interrupted by the addition of  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m edta. the digestion product was analysed by  <dig> % agarose  gel electrophoresis and the 30-50-bp fragments were jointly purified using the high pure pcr product purification kit . ten microliters of purified product were obtained by performing a pcr without primers in a 25-μl final volume containing  <dig>  μm of each dntp,  <dig>  mm mgso <dig>  and  <dig>  u of platinum® taq dna polymerase high fidelity  in the supplied 1x buffer. a pcr program consisting of the following steps was used: 95°c for  <dig> min;  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> min; 44°c for  <dig> min and 72°c for  <dig> min ; and  <dig> min at 72°c. to reassemble the variant genes, the product of the primer-less pcr  was used as template for a second pcr using the cry8ka1sfif and cry8ka1sfir primers. the pcr mixture had a final volume of  <dig> μl and contained  <dig>  mm of each dntp,  <dig> mm mgso <dig>   <dig> nm of each primer and  <dig> u of taq /platinum® taq dna polymerase high fidelity   in the supplied 1x platinum taq buffer. the conditions for the second pcr were as follows:  <dig> min at 95°c;  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at 95°c;  <dig> s at 45°c and  <dig> min at 72°c;  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at 95°c;  <dig> s at 43°c and  <dig> s at 72°c ; and finally,  <dig> min at 72°c. all assembly reactions were performed in a mastercycler gradient thermocycler . the amplified shuffled product of approximately  <dig> bp was analysed on a 1% agarose  gel, the single band of approximately  <dig> bp was excised and the dna was gel-purified using the geneclean® ii kit . this product was digested using the sfi i enzyme, and the variant genes  were ligated into the pcomb3x phagemid   <cit> , which was also linearised using the sfi i site. for a single reaction, t <dig> dna ligase   and 5x ligase buffer were mixed to obtain a 200μl final volume. the ligation product was dialysed, lyophilised and dissolved in  <dig> μl of water and subsequently fractionated into five aliquots. each aliquot  was used to transform  <dig> μl of the electrocompetent xl1-blue® strain of escherichia coli , and the following procedures were carried out as first described by barbas iii et al.  <cit>  using the same modifications that were previously reported in  <cit> .

 <dig>  selection of the cry8ka <dig> toxin variants that bind to a. grandis bbmvs 
the biopanning procedure for screening the combinatorial library and selecting specific cry8ka <dig> toxin variants fused to phage particles was performed as described by barbas iii et al.  <cit>  with modifications recently reported by craveiro et al.  <cit> . at each round, wells in microtitre plate were coated with bbmv preparation  and incubated  <dig> h at 4°c. after five rounds of selection, the clones from the cycle that exhibited the highest number of colony-forming units  were isolated and analysed to verify the integrity of the inserted cry8ka <dig> variant genes via colony pcr using the cry8ka1sfif and cry8ka1sfir primers . the clones that presented amplicons around  <dig> bp in length were further used for the expression of cry8ka <dig> variant proteins.

 <dig>  expression of cry8ka  in fusion phage particles
first, the parental cry8ka <dig> gene and several variants exhibiting size integrity  were expressed on the surface of m <dig> phage and analysed by immunodetection  exactly as reported in a previous study using the cry1ia <dig> gene and variants by craveiro et al.  <cit> .

 <dig>  subcloning of cry8ka <dig> and selected variant genes into vectors for expression in e. coli bacteria
to confirm that toxins expressed by phage fusion exhibited correct folding and activity, cry8ka <dig> and cry8ka <dig> variant genes were subcloned into the pet101/d topo  plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions. the cry8petf  and cry8petr  primers were used to insert recombinant sites into genes. the pet101-based expression constructions, cry8ka1pet <dig> and cry8ka5pet <dig>  were used to transform e. coli cells of the bl <dig>  strain according to the manufacturer's instructions. one colony of the bacteria carrying each construct was cultivated at 37°c in  <dig> ml of luria bertani  medium containing ampicillin  , under vigorous agitation  until an od600nm of  <dig>  was reached. this pre-inoculum suspension was used to inoculate  <dig> l of fresh lb selective medium, which was agitated for  <dig> h after induction by the addition of iptg to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm. before induction, an aliquot of the culture cells was collected and reserved. typically, cells were harvested by centrifugation , and the pellet was resuspended using  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm tris- hcl  buffer. thereafter, the cell suspension was lysed by sonication and stored at -80°c until use. final purification of his6x-tagged mature cry8ka <dig> and variant toxins was performed using affinity chromatography on  <dig> ml batches of ni-nta  solid phase. the column equilibrium and chromatography conditions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. the eluted fractions were collected, dialysed against water and then lyophilised.

 <dig>  western blotting analysis
the purified recombinant proteins were analysed using sds-page  <cit> . typically, a 12% gel was loaded with  <dig> μg of each expressed protein . after electrophoresis, the proteins in the gel were visualised by coomassie blue r- <dig> staining. for western blotting, the protein samples were transferred onto a hybond™-c extra nitrocellulose membrane using a trans-blot semi-dry transfer cell . the solution used to block the membrane consisted of 2%  bovine serum albumin  in tbs . thereafter, the membrane was incubated with anti-his-ap conjugate   for  <dig> h at room temperature. after the membrane was washed three times using tbs-t  tween  <dig>  added to tbs), the immune reactive bands were detected by immersing the blot according to the manufacturer's instructions using an alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate® kit .

 <dig>  quantification of the expressed toxins 
to quantify proteins expressed by e. coli , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  were performed using the polyclonal rabbit anti-cry8ka <dig> antibody, which was previously produced and purified by our team . the concentration of purified proteins was first determined according to bradford method  <cit> . for a standard curve, a serial dilution was performed using purified cry8ka <dig> toxin  in wells of a microtiter plate. the wells of the plate were protein immobilised for  <dig> h at 4°c and then blocked using a solution containing 3%  bsa in tbs-t buffer for  <dig> h at room temperature. following the washes, the polyclonal anti-cry8ka <dig> antibody  was deposited and incubated for  <dig> h at 4°c. after washes, samples were incubated with anti-rabbit igg secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase   for  <dig> h at room temperature. the tmb peroxidase eia substrate kit®  was used for detection according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the reaction was stopped with  <dig> n h2so <dig>  the absorbance was measured at  <dig> nm using benchmark plus . the assays were carried out in triplicate.

 <dig>  bioassays of cry8ka <dig> and variants using a. grandis larvae
to assess the toxicity of cry8ka <dig> and its variants against neonate a. grandis larvae the bioassays were performed in two different situations. in the first bioassays for fast screening of variants indicating toxicity, fusion phage-expressed cry8ka <dig> and variants were utilized in artificial diet . later bioassays were repeated using expressed in bacteria and purified cry8ka <dig> and variants  showing significant toxicity in preliminary screening. in both, bioassays were carried out in six-well cell culture plates filled with artificial diet  and phage-expressed  or cry8ka <dig> or variants . twelve larvae were placed in each well and the plate was incubated for seven days at 27°c  with 80% relative humidity and a 14-h photoperiod. an artificial diet containing no additional cry proteins was used as the negative control. each treatment was carried out in triplicate and the bioassay was repeated to until six different dates. after seven days, the number of surviving larvae was recorded for each treatment. statistical analyses were performed to compare the average percent mortalities by anova and tukey's means comparison analysis using the sigmastat® software vs.  <dig>  . the lc <dig>  obtained from bioassays performed using bacteria-expressed proteins was calculated by probit analysis  <cit>  using the polo-pc software .

 <dig>  dna sequence analysis
the nucleotide sequences of the cry8ka <dig> variant genes encoding toxins active against a. grandis larvae  were determined using a 3130xl genetic analyser . to obtain the complete nucleotide sequences, several primers were used. 1) primers designed to determine the n-terminal and c-terminal sequences were as follows: pcombf  and pcombr . 2) primers designed to obtain the intermediate sequences were as follows: cry8interf , cry8interr , cry8ka5interf  and cry8ka5interr . the sequences were analysed using the blastn and blastp algorithms  <cit> , which are available on the ncbi homepage http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi. in order to assemble the sequenced fragments and to identify the position of the mutated residues, multiple sequence alignment programs were used, including the staden package   <cit>  and clustalw   <cit> .

 <dig>  molecular analysis and homology modelling
proteins showing homology to cry8ka <dig> were found in the nr database at the national center for biotechnology information  using blast with default parameters  <cit> . the resulting sequence set was aligned using muscle  <cit> . suitable templates for cry8ka <dig> model building were found using a fasta search of sequences in the protein data bank  <cit>  at the european bioinformatics institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta <dig> 

after manual refinement of the sequence alignment, homology models of cry8ka <dig>  and mutant cry8ka <dig>  were created using modeller, version  <dig>   <cit> . the cry8ea <dig>  <cit>   toxin structures was used as template for construction of the structural model. in the final alignment, cry8ka <dig> shared  <dig> % sequence identity with the template. default regimes of model refinement by energy minimisation and simulated annealing were employed. because of the low sequence similarity between target and template, a rigorous iterative modelling protocol was adopted in which  <dig> models were constructed and analysed. these models were analysed for packing and for stereochemical properties using procheck  <cit> . possible misalignments were highlighted by dope  peaks, and variations in alignment of these regions were examined. when no further improvements could be achieved, the model with the best procheck and dope scores was taken as the final model. diagrammatic representations of the structures were generated using pymol  <dig>   <cit>  .

RESULTS
 <dig>  dna shuffling and combinatorial library construction
to generate variants by applying the dna shuffling procedure, the cry8ka <dig> nucleotide sequence  was pcr-amplified from the original vector and fragmented using dnase i. the resulting fragments in the 30- <dig> bp range were jointly purified and recombined to form reassembled genes using two consecutive pcr progressive programs. using agarose gel electrophoresis, the dna shuffling product was visualised as a single band of around  <dig> bp that represented a population of cry8ka <dig> variant genes .

both the dna that contained the population of gene variants  and also the pcr-amplified cry8ka <dig> gene were excised from gel, purified and then cloned into the pcomb3x phagemid, resulting in pcombcry8ka <dig> and pcombcry8ka1var constructs. the pcombcry8ka1var construct was used to generate a combinatorial phage-display library of cry8ka <dig> variants containing  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml.

 <dig>  screening of cry8ka <dig> combinatorial library towards bbmvs a. grandis
to select the clones expressing cry8ka <dig> variants that bind specifically to the a. grandis midgut, the phage-display combinatorial library was used for biopanning. five selection rounds were performed. the fifth round was chosen because it yielded phage showing the highest binding specificity to a. grandis bbmvs . two hundred randomly chosen clones from the fifth round exhibited amplicons corresponding to the original gene size of around  <dig> bp . the expression of the variant proteins was confirmed by dot blot detection of the haemagglutinin  epitope fused to the variant proteins. a reaction signal was observed in the dot blot for most of the analysed clones . thirty clones that showed an expression signal in the dot blot analyses were randomly selected for further analysis of activity against a. grandis.

 <dig> . evaluation of toxicity of the cry variants in bioassays
to assess the lc <dig>  neonate a. grandis larvae were incubated with purified cry8ka <dig> and cry8ka <dig> toxins expressed by the e. coli bl <dig>  strain .

bioassays were conducted to evaluate the activity of cry8ka <dig> variants compared to the wild-type cry8ka <dig> toxin when incubated with neonate a. grandis larvae. the larvae mortality rate  indicated no significant difference between treatment with a diet supplemented with cry8ka <dig> protein, a diet supplemented with m <dig> helper phage or a diet with no protein supplementation  at the concentration tested. on the other hand, two  out the thirty cry8ka <dig> variants tested had a statistically significant effect on a. grandis compared to controls. the analysis of variance was significant for the mortality rates of these two variants. based on these results, the cry8ka <dig> toxin was selected for additional characterisation . the lc <dig> for the recombinant cry8ka <dig> protein was significantly lower  than that of cry8ka <dig>  , indicating improved toxicity  for the novel toxin  selected from the combinatorial library of cry8ka <dig> variants .

 <dig> μg/ml of expressed phage were used in every treatment

 <dig>  structural analysis of cry8ka <dig> variant toxins
firstly, the presence of genetic variability in the cry8ka <dig> combinatorial library was determined using nucleotide sequence analysis  of  <dig> clones isolated from the pool of variants that was obtained at the fifth round of biopanning, which was chosen as the cycle containing the highest enrichment of specific phage.

the selected cry8ka <dig> gene  encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acid residues. sequence comparisons among the parental cry8ka <dig> gene  and the variant genes identified numerous nucleotide substitutions . however, most of these nucleotide substitutions were silent mutations. in silico amino acid sequence translation revealed just six changed residues that were located in positions distributed throughout the three typical domains of cry toxins, using the cry8ka <dig> and cry8ka <dig> comparison as indicated . one substitution was observed in domain i , two substitutions  were observed in domain ii and three substitutions  were observed in domain iii. in addition to residue substitution, a deletion of  <dig> residues in the n-terminal part of the cry8ka <dig> protein was observed, and this deletion was responsible for the reduced size of the mutant as compared to cry8ka <dig> . additional sequence analyses revealed that the five conserved blocks in the primary structure that were previously defined in typical cry toxins  <cit>  were retained in both the cry8ka <dig> parental molecule and the shuffled cry8ka <dig>  according to multiple sequence alignments , the cry8ka toxins studied here had all of the highly conserved residues  except for residue r, which was substituted to s in position  <dig>  there seems to be no obvious functional consequence of this substitution.

in addition, molecular homology analyses performed using three-dimensional models constructed in this study showed identical folding to cry8ka <dig> such that cry toxins were included in the group of three-domain cry toxins. the structural alignments using cry8ka <dig> and cry8ka <dig> protein sequences indicated the three best results showing  <dig> ;  <dig>  and  <dig> % of identity with cry8ea <dig>   <cit> , cry3aa   <cit>  and cry3bb <dig>   <cit> , respectively. our proposed model for cry8ka toxins was obtained from structural alignments submitted to modeller  and is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the final cry8ka <dig> and cry8ka <dig> structural models were chosen based on similar and uniform distribution of amino acids in a ramachandran plot  and on dope analysis. the dope residue-by-residue energy profiles for the final models  suggested that the models were of high quality.

the cry8ka <dig> and cry8ka <dig> mutant models had the same backbone structure and differed only in the mutated side chains. due to the very low sequence identity found in the n- and c-termini when compared to the template, these regions were not modelled. as shown in figure  <dig>  the cry8ka toxin model presents the three conserved domains  typical of cry toxins. the positions of residues replaced in the shuffling process can be better seen in figures 6b-d, in which the individual domain structures are illustrated. all mutations are localised at the surface and exposed to the solvent. in the cry8ka <dig> model, domain i consists of residues 1- <dig>  domain ii contains residues 239- <dig> and domain iii includes residues 451- <dig> 

 <dig>  discussion
in this work, the cry8ka <dig> gene was used as a substrate for dna shuffling. this gene was isolated from the b. thuringiensis s <dig> strain  <cit>  and codes for a  <dig> residue protein with the conserved three domain structural architecture typical of cry toxins. the cry8ka <dig> toxin has been shown to be moderately toxic to a. grandis, and our research focused on the molecular improvement of the cry8ka <dig> toxin. the challenge was to introduce changes in the primary structure and thereby achieve improved insecticidal activity.

the combined strategy using dna shuffling and phage display techniques resulted in a combinatorial library containing  <dig> variants. the efficiency of the dna shuffling approach to improve specificity and to broaden the spectrum of insects controlled by bt toxins was first mentioned in experiments using the cry1ca gene. screening of a cry1ca-shuffled library for activity against spodoptera frugiperda revealed a bt toxin variant showing  <dig> -fold higher lc <dig> when compared to the wild-type. in other experiments, cry1ca variants tested against s. exigua showed  <dig> -fold higher activity than wild-type cry1ca. in addition, the same variants were active against both heliothis zea and s. exigua  <cit> .

when screening genes for naturally occurring genetic variability or for artificially generated variability as performed in this study, the major concern is the choice of an optimal selection system that guarantees efficient screening of mutants containing the desired characteristics. the technique of displaying molecules on the phage surface  <cit>  has been widely applied to select antibody chains, to identify receptor ligands, to define enzyme substrates, and to select anticoagulant activities and proteinase inhibitors  <cit> . in addition, phage display systems have proven to be a useful tool for studying toxins with binding domains such as cry toxins  <cit> . in the present study, we applied phage display methodology using m <dig> filamentous phage; we chose to couple this strategy to dna shuffling because cry toxins are ab-type toxins, which have been shown to be suitable targets for directed evolution  <cit> . as discussed in a previous study from our group  <cit> , similar studies have encountered problems with the functionality of proteins displayed on m <dig> phage. in this study, the bioassays using cry8ka <dig> recombinant protein confirmed the molecule's effectiveness and emphasised the need to establish better conditions that would overcome constraints to successfully express cry protein variants with the m <dig> phage display system. the mortality found from negative control in the first screening bioassays was due the m <dig> phage system. the bioassays using boll weevil artificial diet as here described represent a routine in our researches aimed to investigate the potential of novel molecules against boll weevil larvae. however, it is clear that for biotechnology purpose, e.g. production of insect-resistant plants, further tests must be conducted using boll weevils in presence of the genetic modified plants containing the selected variant genes. in the present work the selected cry8ka <dig> mutant toxin with improved activity against the insect target had six residue substitutions distributed throughout the three domains and a shorter n-terminal end than the wild-type cry8ka <dig>  because the selected mutant toxin was  <dig>  times more active than the parental cry8ka <dig> toxin and  <dig>  times more active than the cry1ia <dig> toxin  <cit> , we concluded that the strategy of combining dna shuffling and phage display was able to effectively select novel toxins that are more highly active against the cotton boll weevil.

we modelled the three-dimensional structures of the cry8ka <dig> toxin and the cry8ka <dig> mutant toxin by using the three-dimensional crystal structure of activated cry8ea <dig>  toxin  <cit>  as templates for homology modelling. cry <dig> and cry3-type toxins are active against a number of coleopteran pests; however, cry8ea <dig> showed specific toxicity against holotrichia parallela   <cit> . although cry coleopteran toxins have not been as extensively studied as cry1a, it has been shown that, as for cry1a lepidopteran-specific toxins, the pore formation activity of cry <dig> toxins depends on the formation of an oligomeric pre-pore structure after the interaction of protoxins with bbmv midgut cells from the colorado potato beetle  <cit> . one previously reported theory is that the helix bundle in domain i is directly responsible for membrane penetration and pore formation after cry toxins bind the specific receptors on the surface of the insect midgut  <cit> . in support of this theory, our cry8ka toxin models confirmed the presence of a seven-helix bundle, as has been generally described, and we also visualised the helix α <dig> separated in two helices , which is conserved among cry toxin structures  <cit> . according to previous authors, the α <dig> helix break could be related to the mobility of the lid on the helix bundle during correct receptor recognition. at that moment, the lid comprising helix α2b and loop α2b- α <dig> must be removed from the top of the helix bundle to release the helical hairpin α4-α <dig>  based on mutagenesis studies, the same authors discussed the significance of the conserved pro- <dig> residue  in maintaining the stability of cry8ea <dig>  according to a more recent model proposed for the initiation of cry toxin domain disassembly, pro- <dig> could be the key in facilitating the lid-opening starting from a stable conformation  <cit> . based on these structural analyses, we suggest that the dna shuffling strategy applied here was able to generate mutations without causing conformational changes that could affect the stability of a new toxin. regarding the involvement of the domains ii and iii in the cry toxin mechanism, a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and membrane binding studies  <cit>  showed that the exposed loops of domain ii on cry3a are involved in receptor binding and that mutations can affect binding, resulting in increased or decreased toxicity. loop  <dig> and loop  <dig> in domain ii of cry3a are directly involved in receptor binding. in addition, the same authors suggested that the loop iii region might play a role in irreversible binding or membrane insertion. one of the mutations created by the cry8ka <dig> gene shuffling procedure is localised in loop  <dig> of domain ii in cry8ka <dig>  however, neither of the two mutations in domain ii of cry8ka <dig> is located in these loops.

our results indicated that most structural features of the highly conserved residues are present in the cry8ka modelled structures. given that our experiments to determine the specific receptors for cry8ka <dig> toxins are currently in development, the use of the molecular modelling results to explain how differences in toxicity could be caused by the specific residues changes is somewhat speculative. a cdna library constructed using intestinal material from cotton boll weevil larvae will be used to screen receptor proteins. we hope that studies involving receptor-toxin interactions will allow us to elucidate the binding differences and increased toxicity related to the replaced residues in the three domains of the cry8ka <dig> mutant.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that the strategy of combining dna shuffling and phage display was able to effectively select novel toxins that are more highly active against the cotton boll weevil. with its improved toxicity against the cotton boll weevil, a major cotton insect-pest, the cry8ka <dig> gene has the potential to be used in plant transformation experiments to produce genetically modified cotton plants that are a. grandis-resistant. our modelling studies show conservation of core residues in the cry8ka <dig> toxin structure, suggesting that the mutations altering activity should not affect molecular stability.
