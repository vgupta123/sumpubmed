BACKGROUND
anticipation is a medical observation that refers to the progressive worsening of a disease's symptoms and/or an earlier age of onset over successive generations of affected family members  <cit> . although historically controversial, the concept gained widespread scientific acceptance with the identification in  <dig> of unstable trinucleotide repeats associated with fragile x syndrome  <cit>  and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy   <cit> . today,  <dig> human diseases, some of which also exhibit anticipation, have been associated with unstable repeats  <cit> . diseases for which unstable microsatellites are the causative disease mechanism can be divided into those caused by coding or non-coding repeat expansions.

the majority of disease-associated coding repeats identified to date are cag-type repeats encoding an expanded poly-glutamine tract in affected individuals. cag-type expansion disorders include spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy   <cit> , dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy   <cit> , huntington disease   <cit>  and a range of spinocerebellar ataxias  including sca <dig>  <cit> , sca <dig>  <cit> , sca <dig>  <cit> , sca <dig>  <cit> , and sca <dig>  <cit> . in these diseases, an expanded poly-glutamine tract results in a toxic gain of function causing either neuronal degeneration  <cit> , or in mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia , neuronal dysfunction due to purkinje cell abnormalities  <cit> . the precise pathogenic disease mechanism is unknown but requires expression of the expanded polyglutamine tract. neuronal inclusion bodies are observable on autopsy  <cit> .

untranslated repeats are diverse and include non-trinucleotide repeats. for example, progressive myoclonic epilepsy type  <dig>  pathology results from an expansion of the dodecamer ccccgccccgcg  <cit>  and an attct repeat expansion is the pathogenic agent in sca <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to the coding repeat disorders, non-coding repeats can expand dramatically into the range of thousands of repeats  <cit> . most non-coding repeat expansions are not associated with neuronal inclusion bodies on autopsy  <cit> , with the exception of fragile x-associated tremor ataxia syndrome  <cit> , and nuclear foci observed in neurons of myotonic dystrophy patients  <cit> .

anticipation has been reported in a number of orphan diseases in which repeat expansion may have a role in etiology. these diseases include autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy  <cit> , crohn's disease  <cit> , leukemia  <cit> , nodal osteoarthritis  <cit> , parkinson's disease  <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , truncal heart defects  <cit> , mood disorders  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit> , and anxiety disorders  <cit> . although no repeat expansions have been associated with any of these disorders, no comprehensive surveys have been undertaken.

historically if one suspected a polymorphic microsatellite repeat were associated with a disease, few bioinformatics resources were available to identify relevant repeats in the human genome. one approach now available is to browse the tandem repeats finder   <cit>  track on the ucsc genome browser  <cit>  within a genomic region of interest. trf at ucsc was executed with liberal insertion and deletion  and substitution penalties that allow the detection of larger, frequently impure repeats. since pure repeat tracts are more likely to expand than impure repeat tracts following transmission  <cit>  a large fraction of repeats presented at ucsc are probably not relevant for disease association studies. furthermore, certain known disease-associated repeats, such as the gaa repeat in friedreich's ataxia   <cit> , are not detected at all at ucsc because they are too short to be detected by their trf parameters. other groups have created databases of all 2– <dig> repeat unit satellite repeats within human gene regions  <cit>  and of all 1– <dig> repeat unit microsatellites across prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa  <cit> . collins detected microsatellites with a novel algorithm and deposited this data in a relational database called grid short tandem repeats  database  <cit> . this database included in silico polymorphism detection of coding trinucleotide repeats by using the blast algorithm to detect each repeat's length polymorphisms within genbank, but only for a subset of coding repeats  <cit> . these resources enrich the microsatellite repeat bioinformatics landscape but do not integrate these data with other published resources in a way relevant for repeat prioritization in disease-association studies. also, these resources do not provide flexible interfaces for combining data in user-defined ways to allow dynamic generation of candidate repeat lists. for example, both the microsatellites repeat database   <cit>  and the str databases  <cit>  provide static co-ordinates of candidate repeats for disease-association studies defined by the author's criteria, but lack the functionality to easily re-prioritize repeats based on user preferences.

to address these deficiencies we created satellog, a database that catalogs all pure 1– <dig> repeat unit satellite repeats in the human genome along with supplementary data we believe to be of use for the prioritization of satellite repeats in disease association studies. for each pure repeat satellog can also calculate the percentile rank of its length relative to other repeats of the same class in the genome, its polymorphism within unigene clusters  <cit> , its location relative to known genes  <cit> , and its expression profile in normal tissues according to the genenote database  <cit> . repeats within satellog can be prioritized based on any of their characteristics , polymorphism profile within unigene, proximity to or presence within gene regions , metadata of the genes they are detected within, and gene expression profiles within normal human tissues. disease-associated repeats from  <dig> diseases were used as a test set to see what fraction could be detected independently within satellog and what could be learned about polymorphic repeats in general. to showcase its utility, we used satellog to prioritize repeats for disease-association studies in huntington's disease and schizophrenia. satellog is available as a web-queriable database along with all source code licensed under gnu general public license at .

RESULTS
summary statistics
a total of  <dig> , <dig> pure repeats were detected by trf in the human genome and were stored in satellog. of these,  <dig> , <dig> or  <dig> % were detected within an ensembl-defined gene or within  <dig> kb flanking either side of an ensembl gene. these repeats mapped to  <dig> , <dig> genetic locations in or near ensembl genes, reflecting the fact that some repeats were located within more than one gene. of the genes in ensembl, 92%  had at least one pure repeat within  <dig> kb of their gene boundaries. all repeats in satellog clustered into  <dig>  unique repeat classes. overall, repeat counts correlated with decreasing chromosomal size, however chromosome  <dig> had the highest density of repeats in accordance with previously published reports  <cit>  . data summarizing repeat counts and density by repeat unit size and chromosome , by specific repeat unit  and by gene region  are also available online as supplementary information.

characteristics of disease-associated repeats
disease-associated repeats and their common properties were recently reviewed  <cit> . we queried the database with these sequences to observe any characteristic features of these repeats relative to all other repeats. we asked how many of these repeats could be identified as potentially unstable using only the bioinformatics resources within satellog. the co-ordinates for  <dig> of the  <dig> disease-associated repeats were manually collected from the review and identified in satellog. repeats that were not analyzed either had a repeat period greater than  <dig>  or were polymorphic but not associated with any disease. for these disease-associated repeats, there is no record of their precise genomic co-ordinates. to address this, we used satellog to probe for the probable repeat that corresponded to each disease by selecting all repeats of the expected class within each disease gene. all repeats were detected, except for the repeat responsible for blepharophimosis  <cit> . in  <dig> cases, more than one candidate was detected as the disease-associated repeat for a disease. these cases usually involve flanking repeats of the same class that are detected as two distinct repeats because of an interrupting unit, an established characteristic of some disease-associated repeats such as those responsible for sca <dig>  <cit>  and fragile x syndrome  <cit> . in these cases, we simply retained both repeats and associated them with the disease.

a total of  <dig> repeats were mapped for  <dig> diseases. interestingly, these repeats were from only  <dig> repeat classes. trinucleotide repeats are the most common repeat class implicated in disease  <cit> , especially for disorders caused by coding repeat expansion. of the disease-associated repeats we analyzed,  <dig> of the  <dig> were trinucleotide repeats with  <dig> being from the cag repeat class,  <dig> from the gcg repeat class, and one each from the ccccgccccgcg, cctg, gaa, and attct repeat classes respectively. these disease-associated repeat classes had dramatically different genomic distributions . for example, the ccccgccccgcg dodecamer implicated in progressive myoclonic epilepsy type  <dig>   <cit>  is the only pure repeat of its class detected in the human genome and therefore has a singleton as its distribution. the remaining repeat classes have broader distributions, particularly the gaa repeat class. gaa repeats have been reported to have a unique distribution relative to other trinucleotide repeats due to their evolutionary origin within alu repeats  <cit> . satellog recapitulated a distinct, expanded profile for gaa repeats relative to all other trinucleotide repeats .

we defined significant repeat length in the reference genome as any repeat with length within the top 5% of its class . using this cut-off, we determined whether the reference genome repeat length is significant for any of the disease-associated repeats within their respective disease classes. interestingly, 80%  of the disease-associated repeats in figure  <dig> were significantly long in the reference genome given their repeat class' length distribution . in fact,  <dig> of  <dig> of all disease-associated repeats had a percentile rank of  <dig>  or less indicating that these repeats were the extreme outliers within their class. of the coding repeats,  <dig> of  <dig> had significant repeat lengths, including all the cag-type repeats. exceptions were the cleidocranial dysplasia , hand-foot-genital syndrome , synpolydactyly, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy , and holoprosencephaly coding gcg repeats. the ccccgccccgcg dodecamer implicated in progressive myoclonic epilepsy type  <dig>  is not included in this comparison because there were no other pure repeats of its class in the genome.

polymorphic repeats detected in unigene clusters
we used a bioinformatics approach to see if we could detect repeat polymorphisms within unigene sequences. of the  <dig> , <dig> pure repeats detected by satellog,  <dig> % or  <dig>  repeats were detected as transcribed by the ensembl api  of the gene). of these repeats, approximately half  were detected within unigene cluster sequences. finally, of these repeats, only  <dig>  repeats were detected as polymorphic . a measure of repeat polymorphism was provided by calculating the standard deviation  of all repeat lengths detected within a unigene cluster. a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  polymorphic repeats were detected in coding, 5'-utr, and 3'-utr sequence respectively . our ability to generalize repeat polymorphism trends within genetic regions was confounded by increased sampling of the 3' end of genes . to control for this, we compared the polymorphism profile of repeats in coding, 5'utr, and 3'utr regions that had equal sampling depth. by one-way anova, we found a significant difference between coding , 5'-utr , and 3'utr  repeats. there was significant repeat polymorphism in the 3'-utr sequence relative to coding sequence but not to 5'-utr sequence after controlling for sampling bias . next we evaluated the tolerance of repeat polymorphisms by various repeat periods in coding and utr sequence. to observe if highly polymorphic repeats were restricted to certain repeat periods , the repeat period distribution was observed at progressively increasing sd values . untranslated repeats were well distributed across all repeat periods except for  <dig> mers at an sd cut-off of  <dig> . at increasing sd cut-offs, untranslated polymorphic repeats were detected as penta-, tri-and mainly di-nucleotide repeats . in contrast, while coding repeat polymorphisms were widely distributed at an sd of  <dig>  they were mainly restricted to trinucleotide repeats at higher sd cut-offs . although the untranslated repeats had higher sd values, their most polymorphic sd values were restricted to mono-and di-nucleotide repeats.

disease-associated repeats detected in unigene clusters
to address whether known disease-associated repeats were polymorphic within unigene clusters, we extracted the top ten most polymorphic coding and non-coding repeats, based on their sd value, and determined if any of the disease-associated repeats were also the most polymorphic. the repeats associated with sbma , drpla, and sca <dig>  were detected as the first-, third-and fourth-most polymorphic coding repeats . the aib-i repeat that confers increased risk of prostate cancer was also detected as polymorphic but not in the top ten. the repeat responsible for fraxe was detected as polymorphic, but not as one of the top ten most polymorphic untranslated repeats .

the ten most unstable untranslated repeats organized by descending standard deviation. no disease-associated repeats are present in this sample.

of the  <dig> disease-associated repeats discussed previously, only  <dig> repeats were detected as polymorphic within unigene clusters. we sought to understand why this occurred. of the  <dig> disease-associated repeats,  <dig> failed to map within the genomic co-ordinates of any mapped unigene cluster. the remaining  <dig> repeats mapped within a unigene cluster's genomic co-ordinates. however,  <dig> of these failed to be detected within unigene sequences even though they mapped within a unigene cluster. this could be because of the 3' bias of the unigene sequences, the incomplete nature of the clusters  <cit> , sequence errors in the representative unigene cluster sequence we searched against for hits , or the limitations of our mapping algorithm. our approach enforces that the repeat must exist with at least  <dig> bp of flanking sequence, which leaves out repeats at the edge of unigene clusters. the remaining  <dig> disease-associated repeats were detected within unigene clusters, but only  <dig> of these repeats were polymorphic. on average, the repeats detected as polymorphic had more hits within unigene clusters than those detected as stable . this suggests that there is a greater chance of observing repeat polymorphism with deeper sampling. all of the polymorphic repeats were limited to one unigene cluster and none of the lengths surpassed the disease pre-mutation threshold of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> pure repeats for the repeats responsible for increased prostate cancer risk , drpla, sbma, sca <dig>  and fraxe respectively  <cit> .

discussion
although one might expect greater polymorphism in utr sequence relative to coding sequence due to reduced evolutionary constraints, both 5'-utr and coding repeats had similar rates of polymorphism, whereas 3'-utr repeats had significantly greater polymorphism compared to these two groups. this may be due to the documented 3'-utr sequence over-representation in unigene  <cit> . however, depending on whether the repeat is within coding or utr sequence, there appears to be constraints regarding what repeat unit sizes can tolerate large polymorphisms. of the more polymorphic utr repeats , there was a single trinucleotide repeat amongst mainly dinucleotide and mononucleotide repeats . on the other hand, the majority of coding repeat polymorphisms, although less pronounced, are almost entirely in factors of three . our results support the observation that coding microsatellite polymorphisms are usually in-frame in order to avoid a deleterious phenotype resulting from frame-shift or to provide a rapid evolutionary response to a changing environment  <cit> .

it is important to consider that larger repeat polymorphisms could cause a unigene cluster to "split" into two distinct clusters. this could downplay a repeat's polymorphism because such repeats would not be evaluated as a single group, therefore decreasing the repeat's sd value. this issue was addressed by pre-mapping all unigene clusters to the human genome. if the repeat co-ordinates were within  <dig> kb of the unigene genomic co-ordinates, then the repeat length hits was retained and merged into a single sd value. in practical terms this was not an issue, since only one of our most polymorphic repeats  mapped to two clusters.

there are certain limitations in using the genenote database to establish expression of repeat-containing genes. specifically, the genenote microarray experiments were conducted with whole tissues, not tissues from particular tissue sub-types  <cit> . for example, users limiting their search to repeats expressed in the brain must bear in mind the possibility that a transcript highly expressed in one anatomical region  may lack sufficient global expression to be detected in the whole brain tissue used by the genenote experiments. users interested in expression in particular anatomical regions might benefit from integrating gene expression data from their anatomical region of interest with repeat data from satellog.

as an example of the utility of satellog, we wished to see how it might have expedited research for groups in the past hunting for candidate unstable repeats. in  <dig>  haplotype analysis of linkage disequilibrium data in huntington's disease patients had indicated a portion of 4p <dig>   as the likely location of the mutation  <cit> . we assumed that the investigators at the time were looking specifically for an unstable, brain-expressed, cag repeat to explain the disease phenotype, similar to sbma  <cit> . using the satellog database, we narrowed down our search for candidates repeats in this area from  <dig>  to  <dig> . three polyglutamine repeats are returned by the database, but the repeat implicated in huntington's disease  stands out as a strong candidate due to its size. if we re-run this query and select only the top 5% of repeats relative to their class, chr4:3108016- <dig> is the only polyglutamine repeat. these repeat characteristics: cag repeat type, brain expression and presence within the top 5% of its repeat class, plus the privilege of hindsight, easily allow us to distinguish this repeat as the lead candidate in this region.

secondly, we sought to prioritize all repeats in disease in which unstable repeats might play a role but in which none have been successfully correlated with disease to date. schizophrenia is one such disease with genetic linkage in region 22q  <cit>  suggesting some role of chromosome  <dig> abberations in disease development. microdeletions in this region in patients affected with velocardial facial syndrome  confers the most consistent genetic predisposition to developing schizophrenia  <cit> . first, we collected all repeats on chromosome  <dig> resulting in a total of  <dig>  repeats. next, since we only observed trinucleotide repeats and higher period repeats in our disease-associated set, we restricted our repeats to those with a period greater than  <dig> resulting in  <dig>  repeats. since the majority of the disease-associated repeats had a significantly longer reference genome length relative to other repeats of the same class, we selected the  <dig>  repeats with a percentile rank less than  <dig> . the cellular pathology associated with schizophrenia shows no evidence of nuclear inclusions mediated by polyglutamine expansions, therefore, the disease phenotype may be mediated by an expansion in the utr region. we selected  <dig> repeats from our set that were located in either the 5'-or 3'-utr. assuming that genes relevant to schizophrenia are expressed in the brain, we limited our analysis to the  <dig> repeats that were within genes expressed in the brain. of our final set of  <dig> repeats,  <dig> repeats in the 3'-utrs of crkl and nipsnap <dig> had evidence of repeat polymorphism in unigene clusters . in this prioritization paradigm, we did not look at any intronic repeats which may mediate the neurological phenotype by a mechanism similar to that of friedreich's ataxia  <cit> . the point is that the prioritization paradigm can be defined by the user to dynamically generate a list of candidate repeats based on feature preference within satellog or the fluctuating biological interpretation of repeat instability.

CONCLUSIONS
satellog enriches the current bioinformatics landscape in which repeats are viewed. for example, the gaa repeat in friedreich's ataxia  <cit>  is not detected at all  in the ucsc genome browser  <cit>  by the trf  <cit>  and variable number tandem repeats  tracks. the vntr feature in ucsc detects all perfect  <dig> to  <dig> repeat units with  <dig> or more copies. repeats detected by this method may over-represent insignificant low period repeats and under-represent potentially interesting high period repeats. in satellog, not only is the friedreich's ataxia gaa repeat detected, but its percentile rank also suggests that this size of gaa repeat is a relatively rare observation in the human genome . satellog integrates disparate data sources to give researchers an idea of how interesting certain repeats are based on their genetic location, tissue expression profile and polymorphism within unigene. it should be noted that satellog does not intend to be a de novo detection method for disease-associated repeats. instead, it provides comprehensive, integrated bioinformatics platform to prioritize repeats in a convenient and efficient manner. satellog also presents the first comprehensive identification and integration of disease-associated repeats with other genomic resources for use as bioinformatics reagents in other studies. satellog should prove useful to investigators interested in prioritizing repeats for typing in diseases showing anticipation or in which repeat polymorphism is thought to play a role in etiology. in addition, given that all sequence information  is from presumed "normal" individuals lacking disease phenotypes; satellog may also prove useful in extending our understanding of the normal role of repeats in genes and transcripts.
