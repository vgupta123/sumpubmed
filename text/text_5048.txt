BACKGROUND
notch <dig> is a heterodimeric, type i transmembrane receptor that is required for cell fate decisions throughout the metazoa  <cit> . the notch <dig> extracellular domain contains  <dig> tandem epidermal growth factor-like  repeats, and three lin/notch repeats. of the  <dig> egf repeats in drosophila notch, deletion of only egf repeats  <dig> and  <dig> prohibits the binding of the notch ligands delta and serrate in in vitro binding assays  <cit> . notch signaling in mammals is also initiated by binding to canonical notch ligands  on adjacent cells. ligand binding activates notch signaling through two proteolytic cleavage events, first in the extracellular domain by the adam <dig> metalloprotease  <cit> , and subsequently in the transmembrane domain by a presenilin complex with γ-secretase activity  <cit> . the released notch intracellular domain  translocates to the nucleus and binds to the csl  transcriptional repressor  <cit> . the nicd/csl complex recruits co-activators including mastermind , and up-regulates a number of target genes including the hes  family of basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulators.

the notch <dig> gene has been inactivated in mice by inserting a neomycin gene into egf <dig>  or by deleting a large internal fragment from aa 1056– <dig> that spans the transmembrane domain . the notch1in <dig> mutation generates a null allele  <cit>  and notch1tm1/con/ <dig> homozygotes have an indistinguishable embryonic lethal phenotype. notch <dig> null embryos die at mid-gestation around e <dig>  with severe defects in somitogenesis, neurogenesis, vasculogenesis and cardiogenesis. the phenotype of flies expressing notch with the ligand binding domain deletion is not known. thus in order to investigate biological consequences of this type of notch mutation, we generated a mouse notch <dig> mutation termed notch1lbd by deleting egf repeats 8– <dig> , which include the putative notch <dig> ligand binding domain. we show that notch1lbd is expressed on the cell surface but cannot bind to canonical notch ligands nor signal in response to these ligands. homozygous notch1lbd/lbd embryos exhibit defects during embryogenesis similar to notch <dig> null mutants. however, notch1lbd transcripts are expressed at levels similar to wild type in es cells and in e <dig>  notch1lbd/lbd embryos, indicating that canonical notch <dig> signaling is not essential for notch <dig> gene expression during early embryogenesis. in addition, while notch <dig> is expressed in oocytes and blastocysts  <cit> , we show that oocyte-specific inactivation of notch <dig> does not affect oogenesis or fertilization and that maternal and zygotic mutants proceed normally through blastogenesis, implantation and gastrulation.

RESULTS
notch signaling defects in notch1lbd/lbd embryos
to generate mice with notch <dig> lacking the putative ligand binding domain, embryonic stem  cells with loxp sequences flanking exons  <dig> –  <dig> of mouse notch <dig> were generated by gene targeting . exons  <dig> and  <dig> encode egf <dig> and egf <dig> and exon  <dig> was included in order that the mutant notch <dig> was ~ <dig> kda lower in molecular weight. two independent es colonies selected for resistance to g <dig> were shown by southern analysis to carry a targeted notch <dig> allele . chimeric mice carrying the mutant allele were crossed with mice expressing the meucre <dig> recombinase transgene  <cit>  to obtain mice with a notch1lbd allele after deletion of exons  <dig> –  <dig> along with the hsvtk/neo cassette . southern blot and pcr analysis of genomic dna were used to genotype e <dig>  embryos of notch1+/lbd crosses . all expected genotypes were represented at this stage. however, only wild type and heterozygous pups were born from  <dig> litters .

pups at postnatal day  <dig>  were genotyped from litters of  <dig> notch1+/lbd females mated to  <dig> notch1+/lbd males. yolk sacs of e <dig>  embryos were genotyped following timed matings of  <dig> notch1+/lbd females to  <dig> notch1+/lbd males.

to determine when notch1lbd/lbd embryos die, embryos from notch1+/lbd crosses were examined during embryogenesis. notch1lbd/lbd embryos were indistinguishable from wild type at ~e <dig> , but by ~e <dig>  notch1lbd/lbd embryos were severely growth-retarded, with a tube-like heart, distended pericardial sac, and defective vascularization of the yolk sac . by ~e <dig> , many mutant embryos were resorbed and all mutant embryos were resorbed by ~e <dig> . therefore notch1lbd/lbd embryos exhibited global defects in notch signaling with a phenotype indistinguishable from notch1in <dig>  <cit>  or notch1tm1/con/ <dig>  <cit>  null embryos.

notch1lbd is expressed at the cell surface but does not signal
blastocysts from heterozygous notch1+/lbd crosses were used to isolate embryonic stem  cell lines of each genotype. reverse transcription -pcr of total rna showed that notch1lbd/lbd es cells expressed notch <dig> transcripts at levels similar to wild type and heterozygous es cells . notch1lbd/lbd es cells had a similar growth rate to notch1+/lbd and notch1+/+ es cells . this was also observed with notch <dig> null es cells  <cit> . an antibody to the extracellular domain of notch <dig>  detected the ~ <dig> kd full length notch <dig> in wild type es cells and the ~ <dig> kda truncated notch <dig> in notch1lbd/lbd es cells . the ~ <dig> kda notch <dig> extracellular domain was not routinely observed, but when present it was in similar amounts in notch1lbd/lbd and notch1+/+cells. flow cytometry showed that equivalent amounts of wild type and mutant notch <dig> receptors were present on the surface of notch1+/+ and notch1lbd/lbd es cells, respectively . therefore the internal deletion that includes the putative ligand binding domain did not affect notch <dig> stability or trafficking to the cell surface.

when notch <dig> binds canonical notch ligands, it undergoes cleavage by γ-secretase and the new n-terminus of activated notch <dig> may be detected by the antibody val <dig>  <cit> . western blot analysis revealed a robust signal for activated notch <dig> in cultured wild type es cells but no corresponding signal was observed in notch1lbd/lbd es cells . thus while notch1lbd is expressed at the cell surface it is not activated under conditions that activate wild type notch <dig>  presumably because of the loss of its ligand binding domain. indeed the notch ligand delta <dig> had reduced binding to notch1lbd/lbd es cells . es cells express each of the four mammalian notch receptors and all would be expected to bind delta <dig>  to confirm that the reduced binding of delta <dig> to notch1lbd/lbd is due to the notch1lbd mutation, we examined delta <dig> binding to notch <dig> null es cells  termed 290- <dig> which lack notch <dig> on the cell surface  <cit> . the binding of delta <dig> to 290- <dig> cells was reduced to the same extent as to notch1lbd/lbd cells . therefore, the deletion of egf repeats 8– <dig> in mouse notch <dig> eliminates delta <dig> binding to notch <dig> as expected, but binding to other notch receptors remains. this residual binding was prevented by including edta in the binding buffer under conditions that prevent notch/ligand binding but do not release notch receptors from the cell surface. delta1-induced notch <dig> signaling was also reduced in notch1lbd/lbd es cells as shown by a co-culture reporter assay which detects signaling through all four notch receptors . a second canonical notch ligand, jagged <dig>  was also defective at inducing notch signaling in notch1lbd/lbd es cells . delta1- and jagged1-induced notch signaling was also reduced, but not eliminated, in notch1in32/in <dig> es cells which are notch <dig> null  <cit>  . residual notch signaling presumably reflects the presence of the other three notch receptors.

notch <dig> signaling is not essential for notch <dig> gene expression in early embryogenesis
the notch1lbd mutant allele is transcribed similarly to the wild type allele in notch1lbd/lbd es cells  but notch1lbd/lbd es cells are defective in notch <dig> signaling . the notch1lbd mutant allele therefore allowed us to determine if signaling via notch <dig> is required for the notch <dig> gene to be expressed in vivo. notch1+/lbd females were crossed with notch1+/lbd males and embryos were examined at mid-gestation. notch1lbd/lbd embryos were morphologically indistinguishable from wild type embryos at e <dig>  and were examined for notch <dig> gene expression by in situ hybridization. it can be seen in fig. 3a that notch <dig> was expressed in the presomitic mesoderm  the forming somite  and the neural tube. the hybridization signal obtained for wild type and notch1lbd/lbd embryos was similar. therefore expression of the notch <dig> gene was not markedly altered by the loss of canonical notch <dig> signaling in early embryogenesis. by contrast, following removal of pofut <dig>  <cit>  or mind bomb  <dig>  <cit> , both of which inhibit notch signaling through all four notch receptors, notch <dig> expression is reduced in the psm and enhanced in neural tube and mesencephalon of e <dig>  embryos. at e <dig> , notch <dig> transcripts were markedly reduced in notch1lbd/lbd embryos . by e <dig>  when notch1lbd/lbd embryos were dying, notch <dig> gene expression was severely reduced .

whole mount in situ hybridization provided additional confirmation that the notch1lbd mutation inactivates notch <dig> signaling. the notch <dig> target and somitogenic genes hes <dig>  myogenin and uncx <dig>  were examined in embryos at e <dig> . at that stage hes <dig> is expressed in neural tube, brain and the forming and formed somites. the hes <dig> gene is a known target of notch <dig> signaling and its expression was severely reduced in notch1lbd/lbd embryos . myogenin is expressed in mature somites of wild type embryos at e <dig> . in notch1lbd/lbd embryos which had 13– <dig>  poorly-formed somites, myogenin expression was greatly reduced . the myogenic transcription factor uncx <dig>  is expressed on the posterior side of mature somites and in the psm of wild type embryos at e <dig> . in notch1lbd/lbd embryos, expression in somites and psm was lost . however, expression of uncx <dig>  was induced in brain in the absence of notch <dig> signaling, as observed previously in embryos defective in signaling through all four notch receptors  <cit> . we previously showed that cyclin d <dig> expression is markedly reduced in notch1lbd/lbd embryos  <cit> . importantly therefore, the notch <dig> signaling defects observed in notch1lbd/lbd embryos are not rescued by non-canonical notch <dig> ligands that might bind to the large portion of the notch <dig> extracellular domain that remains in notch1lbd.

maternal and zygotic notchllbd/lbd mutant blastocysts implant and develop through gastrulation
following oocyte-specific deletion of pofut <dig> or rbp-jκ null oocytes are fertilized and mutant blastocysts develop through gastrulation  <cit> . pofut <dig>  <cit>  and rbp-jκ  <cit>  are essential for notch signaling through all four notch receptors. pofut <dig> transfers fucose to notch receptors and rbp-jκ complexes with the cleaved icd of all notch receptors, but both activities might have effects that are independent of the notch pathway. thus it was of interest to determine if notch1lbd/lbd blastocysts could develop and implant because notch <dig> is expressed in oocytes, fertilized eggs and blastocysts  <cit> . to obtain maternal and zygotic mutant blastocysts, females homozygous for the notch <dig> floxed allele  and carrying a zp3cre transgene were generated . notch1f/f:zp3cre females were mated with notch1+/lbd or wild type males. pups and e <dig>  embryos were genotyped . at birth, all pups from notch1f/f:zp3cre by wild type crosses were heterozygous showing that the cre recombinase was highly efficient since the notch1f allele was not transmitted. at e <dig> ,  <dig> embryos from  <dig> crosses included  <dig> mutants  and  <dig> heterozygotes . therefore, eggs with notch <dig> lacking the ligand binding domain were fertilized by sperm that also lacked functional notch <dig> and gave the same number of e <dig>  embryos as eggs fertilized with a notch1+ sperm.

pups at postnatal day  <dig>  were genotyped from litters of  <dig> notch1f/f:zp3cre or  <dig> notch1+/f:zp3cre females mated to  <dig> notch1+/+ or  <dig> notch1+/lbd males. yolk sacs of e <dig>  embryos were genotyped following timed matings of  <dig> notch1f/f:zp3cre females to  <dig> notch1+/lbd males. n <dig>  notch1

mutant embryos derived from notch1lbd/lbd eggs and therefore lacking maternal and zygotic transcripts of functional notch <dig> were examined at e <dig>  and e <dig> . all notch1lbd/lbd e <dig>  embryos were surrounded by a yolk sac with defective vascularization . notch1+/lbd and notch1lbd/lbd embryos at e <dig>   were morphologically indistinguishable . by e <dig> , the notch1lbd/lbd embryos were significantly smaller than controls, and the notch <dig> null mutant phenotype was readily apparent . all developmental defects in notch1lbd/lbd embryos arising from mutant blastocysts with or without maternal notch <dig> transcripts appeared similar. in addition, mutant embryos were morphologically similar to controls at e <dig>  . therefore notch <dig> signaling induced by canonical notch ligands is not required for oogenesis, ovulation, fertilization or any of the developmental steps involved in blastogenesis, implantation or gastrulation.

discussion
the notch1lbd mutation is a novel notch <dig> inactivating mutation that gives a null phenotype with a defective notch <dig> that is expressed at normal levels at the cell surface. the notch <dig> cleavage site mutant which is not efficiently cleaved by γ-secretase and is defective in notch <dig> signaling  <cit>  may also be expressed at the cell surface but this point has not been directly investigated. however, treatment of t cells with inhibitors of γ-secretase causes an accumulation of a membrane-bound notch <dig> stable intermediate  <cit> . in notch1lbd, removal of aa 290– <dig> from the notch <dig> ecd does not inhibit notch <dig> synthesis, trafficking or stability at the plasma membrane. nevertheless, notch1lbd exhibits reduced signaling through delta <dig> and jagged <dig> to the same extent as notch <dig> null es cells in a co-culture reporter assay. moreover, the binding of delta <dig> is reduced to the same extent as in cells that lack notch <dig> altogether. this is consistent with in vitro binding experiments which identify egf repeats  <dig> and  <dig> of drosophila notch as necessary for canonical ligand binding in vitro  <cit> . however, the drosophila notch egf11/ <dig> deletion mutant has not been investigated for notch signaling abilities, either in co-culture assays or,in vivo in the fly.

notch1lbd/lbd embryos die at ~e <dig> with the same developmental phenotype as embryos that lack notch <dig>  <cit> . it is of interest that, despite the cell surface expression of most of the notch <dig> extracellular domain in notch1lbd, there appear to be no non-canonical notch ligands that rescue mutant embryos at mid-gestation. also of interest, is the fact that heterozygotes develop similarly to wild type mice, and thus notch1lbd does not behave in a dominant negative fashion even though it is expressed at the cell surface in similar amounts to wild type notch <dig>  it will be of interest to see if notch1+/lbd heterozygotes exhibit the more subtle notch <dig> signaling defects observed in the inner ear  <cit> , and in cell competition experiments  <cit>  with other notch1+/null heterozygotes.

whole mount in situ hybridization showed that notch1lbd/lbd embryos exhibit markedly reduced expression of the notch <dig> target genes hes <dig> and cyclin d <dig>  <cit>  and the somitogenic genes myogenin and uncx <dig> . similar results were observed in notch <dig> null mutants  <cit> . however, at e <dig>  notch <dig> transcripts were expressed at similar levels in mutant and wild type controls . previous studies have shown that removal of notch <dig> delays somitogenesis at the 3- <dig> somite stage around e <dig> showing that notch <dig> signaling is active at this stage, even though there are no apparent changes in size, overall appearance, neurogenesis or cell death at e <dig>  <cit> . the embryos in fig. 3a show that notch <dig> gene expression in early embryogenesis is not solely controled by notch <dig> signaling. this conclusion can also be drawn from the equivalent expression of notch <dig> transcripts in notch1lbd/lbd and notch1+/+ es cells . however, by e <dig>  notch1lbd/lbd embryos had markedly less notch <dig> expression than controls . this may suggest that notch <dig> signaling and notch <dig> gene expression operate in a feedback loop at this stage as suggested from results of overexpression of notch <dig> icd in t cells  <cit>  or c2c <dig> cells  <cit> . however, overexpression experiments may induce abberrant regulation of the notch <dig> gene and it is difficult to distinguish direct from indirect effects in vivo. indirect effects on notch <dig> gene expression are seen in pofut <dig>  <cit>  and mib <dig>  <cit>  null embryos defective in global signaling that exhibit increased notch <dig> gene expression in the psm, the forming somite and the forebrain at ~e <dig> , suggesting that notch <dig> expression at that stage is negatively regulated via signaling through notch <dig>  notch <dig> and/or notch <dig>  by e <dig> , notch <dig> gene expression is inhibited in the absence of pofut <dig>  <cit>  or mind bomb  <dig>  <cit> . notch <dig> activation is also inhibited at e <dig>  in embryos lacking rbp-jκ  <cit> .

the conditional notch <dig> floxed allele allowed us to ask whether canonical notch <dig> signaling is required for the generation of developmentally-competent eggs, or for fertilization, pre-implantation development, implantation or gastrulation. previous experiments in which global notch signaling was eliminated by the removal of pofut <dig> or rbp-jκ in oocytes suggest that notch signaling is not required through any of the four mammalian notch receptors until after gastrulation  <cit> . however, pofut <dig> transfers fucose to egf repeats with a consensus sequence that is found in a number of proteins including notch ligands and cripto  <cit> . while the presence of fucose on an egf repeat is not required for the function of either notch ligands  <cit>  or cripto  <cit> , biological roles for o-fucose have only begun to be explored. in addition, recent experiments have shown that notch lacking o-fucose may signal under certain circumstances  <cit> . similarly, notch-independent functions of rbp-jκ have been described  <cit> . finally, notch <dig> is expressed in oocytes during oogenesis  <cit>  and in ovulated eggs and developing blastocysts  <cit> , leading to the prediction that notch <dig> signaling must be important for pre-implantation development  <cit> . thus it was important to examine this question directly. our data clearly show that notch <dig> signaling through canonical notch ligands is in fact dispensable for oogenesis, ovulation, fertilization, blastogenesis, implantation and gastrulation . they also show that expressing an inactive notch receptor at the cell surface does not have an inhibitory effect on any of these developmental processes. however, non-canonical notch <dig> signaling by a pathway yet to be discovered may be active in notch1lbd/lbd oocytes or blastocysts. the fact that notch1lbd is well-expressed at the cell surface but not responsive to canonical notch ligands means it may be used to search for novel notch <dig> signaling pathways that may be active in pre-implantation development.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that deletion of the mouse notch <dig> ligand binding domain generates notch <dig> of ~ <dig> kda that is well-expressed on the cell surface but cannot bind delta <dig> nor be activated by delta <dig> or jagged <dig> in a co-culture signaling assay. homozygous mutant embryos die at mid-gestation with defects similar to notch <dig> null embryos. oocyte-specific deletion of the ligand bindng domain does not impair oogenesis or development of maternal and zygotic embryos until after gastrulation.
