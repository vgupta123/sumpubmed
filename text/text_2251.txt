BACKGROUND
within living organisms, proteins need to locate in the right subcellular compartments to perform various biological functions. mislocalized human proteins are liable to cause numerous human diseases, such as kidney stone  <cit> , bartter syndrome  <cit> , primary human liver tumors  <cit> , alzheimer’s disease  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit> , pre-eclampsia  <cit>  and minor salivary gland tumors  <cit> . knowing where a protein resides within a cell is an indispensable and essential step to uncover its functions and detect drug targets  <cit> . traditional wet-lab techniques such as cell fractionation, electron microscopy and fluorescent microscopy imaging, are applied to construct high quality localization databases such as the human protein atlas. <dig> however, the processes are laborious, expensive and time-consuming. to tackle tremendous numbers of newly discovered protein sequences generated by large-scale sequencing projects, efficient computational methods are required for fast and accurate prediction of protein subcellular localization .

conventionally, pscl was tackled by sequence-based approaches. this type of approaches includes three categories:  sorting-signals based methods ;  amino-acid composition-based methods ;  homology-based methods  <cit> . beyond sequence information, knowledge-based approaches have been developed. this type of approaches uses information from knowledge databases, such as gene ontology  <dig> terms , pubmed abstracts  <cit> , or swiss-prot keywords  <cit> . among these methods, go-based methods were found to be superior in terms of performance .

because many studies  have found the prevalence of multi-location proteins in living organisms, recent studies have been focusing on predicting not only single-location proteins, but also multi-location proteins. multi-label proteins are found to participate in various metabolic activities in multiple cellular compartments. for example, the glucose transporter glut <dig> is found in both the plasma membrane and the intracellular vesicles of adipocytes  <cit> ; proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation is found in the mitochondria and peroxisome; and antioxidant defense proteins are known to reside in the peroxisome, cytosol and mitochondria  <cit> .

many state-of-the-art multi-label predictors – such as iloc-hum  <cit> , hum-mploc  <dig>   <cit> , mgoasvm  <cit> , hybridgo-loc  <cit> , r3p-loc  <cit> , mplr-loc  <cit>  and others  – use go information as features and apply different multi-label classifiers to tackle the multi-label classification problem. nevertheless, due to the high dimensionality of go features, these go-based predictors often have the following drawbacks: 
lack of interpretability. these predictors can only give insights into where the query proteins are located, but cannot provide biological reasons of why they reside there. this is possibly a common problem for most machine-learning based approaches, because it is usually difficult to correlate the statistical characteristics of biological data with biological phenomena. on the other hand, biologists want to know not only the prediction results of query proteins, but also biological features or factors that lead to the prediction results. therefore, the lack of interpretability may limit the powers and applications of these predictors. as far as we know, there is only one subcellular-location predictor called yloc  <cit>  that is interpretable. however, yloc requires heterogeneous biological features such as sorting signals, prosite <dig> patterns and go terms, which are not always available for every protein.

susceptibility to overfitting. the number of extracted go features from knowledge databases  is considerably larger than the number of proteins of interest. most of the existing predictors  construct feature vectors with dimensions as high as several thousand. among these thousands of features, it is likely that many are irrelevant or redundant, causing the predictors suffer from overfitting



to tackle the problems mentioned above, this paper proposes two sparse and interpretable multi-label predictors, namely mlasso and men for large-scale predictions of both single- and multi-location proteins. given a query protein sequence, a set of go terms are retrieved from two newly created compact databases by the procedures described in  <cit> . the frequencies of go occurrences are used to formulate frequency vectors with dimension over  <dig>  by using a one-vs-rest lasso-based  classifier and an en-based  classifier,  <dig> and  <dig> out of these  <dig> + go terms were selected, respectively. with the selected go terms, the frequency vectors are converted into dimension-reduced feature vectors . subsequently, the 87-dim  feature vectors are classified by a multi-label lasso  classifier. experimental results based on a stringent human benchmark dataset demonstrate that the two proposed predictors substantially outperform other state-of-the-art predictors. more significantly, based on go terms selected by either mlasso or men, researchers can decide not only where a protein resides within a cell, but also why it is located there. moreover, men not only selects more go terms than mlasso, but also performs better than mlasso. we have also found that besides cellular-component go terms, go terms from the categories of molecular functions and biological processes also contribute to the final predictions.

legitimacy of using go information
some researchers may have reservations about the use of go information for pscl. in the following, we list the concerns  and our explanations  of why these concerns do not cause problems in pscl. 
because the cellular component go terms have already been annotated with cellular component categories, go-based methods can be simply replaced by a lookup table using the cellular component go terms as the keys and the component categories as the hashed value.

this naive solution is not recommended because not only the cellular component go terms are relevant to the pscl, go terms from the biological processes and molecular functions also play important roles, as demonstrated in  <cit> . in particular, it has been found  <cit>  that go terms in biological process and molecular function categories are particularly relevant to nucleus, extracellular space, membrane, mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus. in fact, the relationship between go terms and pscl is not a one-to-one mapping and recent studies  <cit>  have already shown that this naive solution will lead to very poor performance.

are go-based methods equivalent to transferring annotations from blast  <cit>  homologs?

this concern is explicitly addressed in our previous study  <cit> , which demonstrated that go-based methods remarkably outperform methods that only use blast and homologous transfer . besides, briesemeister et al.  <cit>  also found that using blast alone is not sufficient for reliable prediction.



in fact, as suggested by chou  <cit> , given a predictor, as long as its inputs are amino acid sequences and its outputs  are subcellular localizations, the predictions made by the predictor are legitimate; whether the predictor uses go-based methods or non go-based methods is not an issue. some other papers  <cit>  also provide strong evidences supporting the legitimacy of using go information for subcellular localization. in particular, as suggested by  <cit> , the good performance of go-based methods is due to the fact that the feature vectors in the go space can better reflect their subcellular locations than those in the euclidean space or any other simple geometric space.

RESULTS
datasets
a stringent human benchmark dataset  <cit>  was used to evaluate the performance of mlasso and men. the human dataset was created from swiss-prot  <dig> , which is a publicly accessible protein database. <dig> this benchmark dataset is downloadable from the hyperlink in the spapredictor server. it contains  <dig> human proteins distributed in  <dig> locations. the sequence identity of the dataset was cut off at  <dig> %. figure  <dig> shows the breakdown of the human dataset. here,  <dig> actual proteins  <cit>  correspond to  <dig> locative proteins  <cit> . <dig> as can be seen from fig.  <dig>  the majority  of the human proteins are located in cytoplasm, nucleus, extracellular, mitochondrion and plasma membrane, while proteins located in the other  <dig> subcellular locations account for around  <dig> %. this means that the dataset is very imbalanced.

performance metrics
to facilitate performance comparisons in multi-label classification, some sophisticated performance metrics are introduced here to better reflect the multi-label capabilities of classifiers. these measures include accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score  and hamming loss . the definitions of these five measurements for multi-label classification can be found in  <cit> . accuracy, precision, recall and f <dig> indicate the classification performance. the higher the measures, the better the prediction performance. among them, accuracy is the most commonly used criteria. f1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which allows us to compare the performance of classification systems by taking the trade-off between precision and recall into account. the hamming loss   <cit>  is different from other metrics in that the former concerns about the misclassified instance-label pairs whereas the latter are more interested in the correctly classified instance-label pairs. the lower the hl, the better the prediction performance. more details about the performance metrics can be found in section s <dig> of supplementary materials.

since partial matching has been widely used in measuring classification performance  <cit> , especially in multi-label classification  <cit> , we have also used another two measures: micro f-measure  and macro f-measure . the definitions of these two measures in multi-label learning scenarios can be found in  <cit> . to compute macro f <dig>  the f <dig> of individual classes are independently computed and then averaged. as a result, macro f <dig> treats the f <dig> of individual classes equally important and the measure is insensitive to the imbalance in class sizes. on the other hand, to compute micro f <dig>  the true-positive, true-negative, and false-negative are accumulated across all classes, followed by plugging these values into the standard formula for computing f <dig>  therefore, macro f <dig> considers every binary decision equally important, whereas micro f <dig> will be heavily dependent on the decisions  on the large classes  <cit> .

two additional measures  <cit>  are often used in multi-label subcellular localization prediction. they are overall locative accuracy  and overall actual accuracy . specifically, denote  and  as the true label set and the predicted label set for the i-th protein , respectively. <dig> then, ola is given by: 
   

and the overall actual accuracy  is: 
   

where 
   

among all the metrics mentioned above, oaa is the most stringent and objective. this is because if some  of the subcellular locations of a query protein are correctly predicted, the numerators of the other five measures  are non-zero, whereas the numerator of oaa in eq.  <dig> is  <dig> .

leave-one-out cross validation  is considered to be the most rigorous and bias-free procedure  <cit>  for evaluating classifiers’ performance. hence, loocv was used to examine the performance of mlasso and men.

a comparison between fig.  <dig> and  reveals that the number of essential go terms selected by men is much larger than that selected by mlasso for all of the  <dig> subcellular locations; this phenomenon also occurs across the three go categories. this is because go terms from the same category are not independent on each other; instead they are related in a hierarchical manner. compared to mlasso, men encourages selecting correlated features together, thus causing more essential go terms to be selected. the results are consistent with the claims by zou and hastie  <cit> .

we used the degree of overlapping among the essential go terms found by mlasso and men to investigate the relationship between the go terms found by these algorithms. the results are shown in fig.  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that the  <dig> essential go terms selected by mlasso are totally included in the  <dig> essential go terms selected by men. figure  <dig> show that for centrosome, cytoplasm and mitochondrion, there are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> overlapped essential go terms. for each of these subcellular locations, there is only one essential go term that is found by mlasso but missed by men. specifically, for centrosome, the go term missed by men is go: <dig> ; for cytoplasm, the missed go term is go: <dig> ; and for mitochondrion, the missed go term is go: <dig> . as can be seen from section s <dig> of supplementary materials, the weights of these three go terms for mlasso in the aforementioned subcellular locations are negative and inconsiderable. specifically, the weight of go: <dig> for centrosome is − <dig> ; the weight of go: <dig> for cytoplasm is − <dig> ; and the weight of go: <dig> for mitochondrion is − <dig> . therefore, even though mlasso selects them, these go terms play insignificant roles in predictions. we notice that go: <dig>  is the part of cytoplasm that does not contain organelles, which, in other words, has no direct correlation with centrosome. because men tends to select correlated features together, it is reasonable that men does not select go: <dig> for centrosome. similar reasons are also applied to the other two cases. the remaining  <dig> subcellular locations have similar situations as fig.  <dig>  meaning that all of the essential go terms selected by mlasso are also selected by men. the results suggest that men can select almost all the information selected by mlasso, and more importantly, men can incorporate extra feature information missed by mlasso.

significance of location-specific go terms
to quantitatively demonstrate how and to what extent essential go terms contribute to the prediction of subcellular locations, we analyzed the location-specific weights {β~m}m={ <dig> …,m} defined in eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> for the essential go terms. <dig> as shown in fig.  <dig>  the analyses include  the number of non-zero weights for both algorithms,  the number of positive and negative weights for both algorithms,  distribution of weights for mlasso and  distribution of weights for men. for simplicity, βs,m is abbreviated as β in the figures.

as can be seen from fig.  <dig>  for every subcellular location, the number of non-zero weights for men is larger than that for mlasso, which is consistent with the results in the last section. in fig.  <dig>  we can see that for both mlasso and men, the number of positive weights in every subcellular location is much smaller than that of negative weights. this result suggests that the majority of essential go terms are indicative of not residing in a particular subcellular location.

to further analyze the significance of the non-zero weights of essential go terms, the weights are divided into four intervals: 
  β≤− <dig> ,− <dig> <β< <dig> <β≤ <dig> ,β> <dig> . 

the distributions of the non-zero weights for mlasso and men are shown in fig.  <dig> and , respectively. from these figures, we can observe that the number of weights in the interval β> <dig>  takes up the smallest percentage and most of the weights are within the interval of − <dig> <β< <dig>  this means that the number of essential go terms indicating the presence of query proteins in a particular location is small. nonetheless, when comparing fig.  <dig> and , we found that the percentage of weights in the interval of 0<β≤ <dig>  for men is larger than that for mlasso, which suggests that there are more positive indicators for men than for mlasso to indicate that a query protein locates in a particular subcellular location.

to further compare men and mlasso, fig.  <dig> shows the range of the non-zero weights for each subcellular location. evidently, for almost all subcellular locations, the mean weights of men are larger than those of mlasso, which suggests that men are more capable of positively predicting a query protein than mlasso.

we observe that among the essential go terms, some have much larger absolute weights  than the rest, suggesting that they play more significant roles in making the predictions. specifically, if the weight of an essential go term for a particular subcellular location is larger than a certain positive threshold, it has higher confidence to indicate that the query protein resides in this subcellular location; on the contrary, if the weight is smaller than a certain negative threshold, it has higher confidence to indicate that the query protein does not belong to the corresponding subcellular location. we call these two kinds of go terms as significantly essential go terms.

circular networks for essential go terms and subcellular locations
to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between the essential go terms and the  <dig> subcellular locations for mlasso and men, fig.  <dig> shows the circular networks linking the essential go terms and subcellular locations for four cases:  essential go terms for mlasso;  essential go terms for men;  significantly essential go terms for mlasso; and  significantly essential go terms for men. in all figures, small green dots represent the go terms and the large dots in different colors represent the  <dig> subcellular locations. a line connecting an essential go term and a subcellular location means that the go term contributes to the prediction of the subcellular location. on the other hand, if there is no connection between an essential go term and a subcellular location, then this go term does not provide any information about the presence or absence of a protein in this particular subcellular location. starting from the top-left green dot to the bottom-left green dot in clockwise direction, the degree of overlapping among the lines gradually increases, meaning that the number of subcellular locations to which a go term contributes also gradually increases. for example, in fig.  <dig>  the first  <dig> go terms  are indicative of cytoplasm only, i.e., suggesting whether a protein belongs to cytoplasm or not. similarly, go: <dig> can only indicates whether a protein is located in endoplasmic reticulum or not. on the other hand, go: <dig> is indicative for both centrosome and cytoskeleton; go: <dig> contributes to the prediction of both cytoplasm and nucleus. more aggressively, the last several go terms, such as go: <dig>  go: <dig> and go: <dig>  contribute to the prediction of all of the  <dig> subcellular locations. these essential go terms are indicators of whether a protein resides in one or more subcellular location or not. similar conclusions can be drawn from fig.  <dig>  compared to fig.  <dig> has more essential go terms to indicate the presence or absence of a query protein in the corresponding subcellular location. for readers’ convenience, all the essential go terms found by mlasso and men are listed in section s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively, of supplementary materials.

here we introduce the concept of the key go terms, which are go terms whose names are exactly the same as the names of subcellular locations according to the annotations. interestingly, the key go terms of some subcellular locations are both positive and negative indicators of multiple locations. for example, go: <dig> is the key go term for centrosome. a query protein with this term strongly indicates that it resides in centrosome, which is consistent with our results. however, men and mlasso find that go: <dig> is a negative indicator of cytoplasm, meaning that if a query protein is associated with this go term, this protein is highly likely not to reside in cytoplasm. actually, we have found  that many significantly essential go terms are not only positive indicators of some subcellular locations, but also negative indicators of other subcellular locations . these go terms allow us to find the proteins that cannot be co-located and the subcellular locations of these impossible combinations.

predicting and interpreting novel proteins
to further exemplify how men predicts and interprets the subcellular localization of proteins, we collected several novel proteins as test proteins. these proteins, which include both single- and multi-location proteins, were experimentally determined and were added to swiss-prot between 19-feb- <dig> and 07-jan- <dig>  the novelty of these proteins can impartially demonstrate the prediction powers of our proposed predictors. table  <dig> shows the prediction results of the  <dig> novel proteins by men. as can be seen, although these proteins are totally new to our training dataset , all of them are correctly predicted, including one multi-location protein . the essential go terms that contribute to the prediction decisions are also shown in table  <dig>  a comparison between the essential go terms in fig.  <dig> and the last column in table  <dig> reveals that not all of the essential go terms contribute to the final predictions. for example, for the protein p0dmr <dig>  only  <dig> out of  <dig> go terms are useful for determining the subcellular localization. interestingly, even if two proteins are predicted to the same subcellular location, the essential go terms for the two proteins are not necessarily the same. for example, for d3dtv <dig> and c9jsj <dig>  although both of them are correctly predicted to locate in nucleus, their essential go terms are completely different. and there is no significantly essential go terms for the protein d3dtv <dig>  this suggests that the predictions made by men do not always rely on significantly essential go terms.

discussion
mapping non-essential go terms to essential go terms
some researchers are concerned that not all proteins  are associated with essential go terms selected by mlasso . in this case, the feature vectors for these proteins will be null, which is detrimental for prediction performance. to address this problem, we have proposed a hierarchical-information based approach to map the non-essential go terms to essential go terms. because the go terms in each taxonomy  are hierarchically organized within a directed acyclic graph , go terms in the same taxonomy are not independent with each other. in this case, non-essential go terms are hierarchically correlated with essential go terms within the same taxonomy. therefore, it is feasible and also conducive to map the non-essential go terms to the essential go terms based on their hierarchical structural relationships.

we adopt our recently proposed go mapping method to perform the mapping. here, we briefly outline the procedure. for implementation details, readers may refer to eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> of  <cit> . denote g as a go term  and e as an essential go term. assume that g is one of the go terms associated with a protein and that the number of occurrences of g for that protein is fg. then, mapping g to e is equivalent to finding the contribution of g to the effective number of occurrences of e, where the contribution is computed from the depth distance between g and e as shown in algorithm  <dig>  the effective number of occurrences of e is the sum of the contribution of all go terms associated with the query protein. this procedure is repeated for every essential go terms to form a vector comprising the effective numbers of occurrences of all essential go terms. this go mapping method effectively solves the null-vector problem, because as long as one of the go term associated with the query protein is close enough to any essential go term in the go dag, the resulting vector will not be null.

categorical significance of go terms on prediction
to investigate the contributions of go terms from different categories to the prediction performance of mlasso and men, we have compared the performance of using go terms for the following cases:  all: all go terms are used;  cc + mf: go terms from cellular components  and molecular functions  are used;  cc + bp: go terms from cc and biological processes ; and  mf + bp: go terms from mf and bp are used. the results are shown in table  <dig>  as can be seen, for both mlasso and men, case  performs the best among all the four cases, due to using go terms from all of the three categories. the results indicate that go terms from all of the three categories are conducive to the predictions. moreover, the performance of cases  and  remarkably surpass that of case , which suggests that cc go terms are more far more significant than go terms from the other two categories for the predictions. besides, although case  performs the worst among the four cases, it also demonstrates that go terms from mf and bp are also useful for the predictions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we proposed and compared two sparse multi-label predictors, namely mlasso and men, which can predict as well as interpret the subcellular localization of both single- and multi-location proteins. given a query protein, its feature vector is constructed by exploiting the go frequency information in the proseq-go database. by using the one-vs-rest lasso and en classifiers,  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> + go terms are selected, respectively. based on these selected essential go terms, the interpretability is analyzed for both algorithms.

this paper has the following key contributions:  both men and mlasso are interpretable and perform remarkably better than existing state-of-the-art predictors;  men selects more relevant go terms than mlasso, and meanwhile outperforms mlasso;  experimental results for both methods are consistent with biological annotations, i.e., the key go terms play greater roles in determining subcellular localization of proteins;  like cellular-component go terms, go terms from the categories of molecular functions and biological processes also contribute to the prediction;  essential go terms can be either single-location contributive or multi-location contributive to the prediction, and the contributions can be positive on a subcellular location while be negative on other subcellular locations. for readers’ convenience, the spapredictor web-server and the supplementary materials of this paper are available online at http://bioinfo.eie.polyu.edu.hk/spapredictorserver/.
