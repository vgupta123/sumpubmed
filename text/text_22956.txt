BACKGROUND
the chronic inflammatory disease periodontitis is characterized by tissue and bone destruction. the current concept of the etiology of periodontitis is that bacterial components of the biofilm initiate the inflammatory cascade, including infiltration of immune cells and production of inflammatory mediators in the periodontal tissue. the initial inflammation, gingivitis, may then develop into a chronic inflammatory state of the gingiva causing destruction of the gingival tissue as well as the alveolar bone resulting in decreased support for the teeth, and ultimately tooth loss  <cit> .

among inflammatory mediators involved in periodontitis, prostaglandin e <dig>  has been associated with periodontitis as a potent stimulator of bone resorption, and increased pge <dig> levels have been reported in gingival tissue and gingival fluid from patients with periodontitis  <cit> . moreover, administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , inhibitors of pge <dig> production, has been shown to reduce the progression of alveolar bone resorption in patients with periodontitis, implying that pge <dig> is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease  <cit> .

the proinflammatory cytokine tnfα is also reported to play an important part in the pathogenesis of periodontitis  <cit> . for instance, it has been shown that attachment loss is decreased in periodontitis patients after anti-tnf treatment, and subcutaneous administration of recombinant tnfα is demonstrated to exacerbate experimental periodontitis in rats  <cit> . also, the chronic inflammatory condition rheumatoid arthritis, which shares many characteristics with periodontitis, has been successfully treated using tnfα blockers, further highlighting tnfα as a key inflammatory mediator in chronic inflammatory conditions  <cit> . we have previously shown that tnfα enhances the production of pge <dig> in gingival fibroblasts, but the intracellular signal pathways regulating pge <dig> production and pge2-synthesizing enzymes have still not been completely elucidated  <cit> .

the biosynthesis of pge <dig> from membrane lipids is catalyzed by three groups of enzymes acting sequentially. first, phospholipase a <dig> converts membrane lipids to arachidonic acid  <cit> . the cyclooxygenases  then convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin h <dig>  <cit> . finally, the third and most recently identified group of isoenzymes is the prostaglandin e synthases  which catalyze the conversion of cox-derived prostaglandin h <dig> to pge <dig>  <cit> . up to date, three pge synthases have been described: the microsomal and inducible mpges- <dig>  the constitutively expressed cytosolic cpges and the most recently discovered microsomal mpges- <dig>  <cit> . we have previously reported that mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> are up-regulated by tnfα and il-1β in gingival fibroblasts  <cit> .

the inflammatory mediator pge <dig> as well as the pge2-regulatory enzymes cox- <dig> and mpges- <dig> have been shown to be up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides, il-1β and tnfα also in other cell types, including gastric fibroblasts, synovial fibroblasts, cardiac fibroblasts and gastric cancer cell lines  <cit> . various intracellular signaling pathways have been reported to be involved in inflammatory-induced pge <dig> production and in the expression of pge2-sythesizing enzymes, although these pathways seem to be both cell- and stimulus-specific. for example, in gingival fibroblasts, we have previously reported that the signal pathways pkc and p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase are involved in the regulation of the cytokine-induced cox- <dig> expression but not in the regulation of mpges- <dig> expression  <cit> . in contrast, these two signal pathways are demonstrated to be involved in cytokine-induced mpges- <dig> expression in colonocytes and orbital fibroblasts  <cit> . the differences between cell types and between stimuli make it imperative to study the intracellular regulation of mpges- <dig> as well as cox- <dig> using a cell type and stimulus which is relevant to the disease of interest. in periodontal tissue, the most ubiquitous residential cells are gingival fibroblasts. these cells, by producing inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, prostaglandins and proteolytic enzymes, participate in the inflammatory response and contribute to disease persistence  <cit> .

in this work, we therefore aim to explore the signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of pge2-regulating enzymes mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> in tnfα-stimulated primary gingival fibroblasts through a global gene expression approach, using microarray technology. our results show that the intracellular signal transduction pathways jnk and nf-κb are involved in the regulation of tnfα-induced mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression, as well as pge <dig> production, in gingival fibroblasts.

RESULTS
effect of tnfα on protein expression of pge synthases and cox- <dig> and production of pge2
we have previously reported that the inflammatory mediator tnfα stimulates pge <dig> production via the enzymes mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig>  in this study we aimed to investigate the signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of mpges- <dig>  cox- <dig> and pge <dig> in tnfα-stimulated gingival fibroblasts through global gene expression analysis. in agreement with our previous studies  <cit> , the protein expression of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> was up-regulated by the inflammatory mediator tnfα , as demonstrated by western blot analysis . the time-course analysis, using time points  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, revealed that the stimulatory effect of tnfα was strongest at the  <dig> h time point both for mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig>  when comparing these two enzymes, mpges- <dig> expression increased starting from the  <dig> h time point, whereas cox- <dig> expression time-dependently increased starting from the  <dig> h time point in response to tnfα stimulation. the expression of cox- <dig> also increased in cells not stimulated with tnfα in  <dig> h cultures, as compared to earlier time points. in contrast to mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig>  the expression of the pge synthase isoenzymes mpges- <dig> and cpges was not affected by tnfα in gingival fibroblasts . the western blot results were also confirmed by flow cytometric analysis, revealing an up-regulation of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression in  <dig> h cultures of tnfα-treated cells in contrast to mpges- <dig> and cpges expression . moreover, the induction of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression, in response to tnfα, resulted in a time-dependent increase of pge <dig> production, as shown in figure 1c.

effect of tnfα on mrna expression of pge synthases and cox-2
the mrna expression of mpges- <dig>  mpges- <dig>  cpges and cox- <dig>  as measured by oligonucleotide microarray, is seen in figure  <dig>  the expression of mpges- <dig> as well as cox- <dig> was significantly up-regulated in response to tnfα treatment at the time points indicated . on the contrary, the pge synthase isoenzymes mpges- <dig> and cpges were not differentially expressed at the above-mentioned time points , which is consistent with the protein expression results. the microarray used in this study contained two different probes both for the mpges- <dig> and cpges genes, localized to distinct parts of each mrna transcript. these probes resulted in similar results, and data from both probes was used in the subsequent analysis.

differential expression between tnfα-treated cells and control cells
in the microarray analysis, the mrna samples from  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h cultures were hybridized according to the experimental design illustrated in figure 3a. we used a time-course factorial design, which facilitated identification of the genes that were differentially regulated between the time points due to tnfα treatment with optimal statistical efficiency  <cit> . this design was repeated for all three cell lines included in the study. the majority of the genes that were significantly differentially expressed  were up-regulated in the tnfα-treated cells, which is illustrated in the volcano plots in figure 3b-d. a positive m-value denotes genes up-regulated by tnfα whereas down-regulated genes have a negative m-value. the results showed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between the tnfα-treated and control fibroblasts after  <dig> h incubation . in the comparison between  <dig> h and  <dig> h,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were found , and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between  <dig> h and  <dig> h .

gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes
enrichment analysis was performed to identify overrepresented gene ontology  categories among the differentially expressed genes in the different comparisons. the gene ontology categories represent classes of genes in which more of the individual genes, included in the particular class, are differentially expressed in this data set than would be expected by a random distribution of differentially expressed genes. complete lists of differentially expressed genes and significant go categories are presented in the additional material .

the analysis of the differentially expressed genes at time point  <dig> h gave a go profile indicative of tnfα involvement, where significant categories were immune response, regulation, and apoptosis related . the same types of categories were also significant due to tnfα-treatment between the  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points, signifying that genes annotated to those categories were actively regulated between  <dig> h and  <dig> h . interestingly, positive regulation of two distinct signaling pathways, "positive regulation of i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab cascade" and "positive regulation of jnk cascade", was identified by the enrichment analysis in the comparison of  <dig> h and  <dig> h of tnfα treatment, as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the differentially expressed genes included in these two go categories are listed in table  <dig>  together with the genes of the pge2-synthesizing enzymes pge synthases and cox- <dig> for comparison of m-values, fold changes and p values. for instance, in the category "positive regulation of i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab cascade", the gene for inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b-cells, kinase epsilon , which stimulates the dissociation of nf-κb and its inhibitor  <cit> , was found to be up-regulated by tnfα treatment . furthermore, the comparison of  <dig> h to  <dig> h gene expression results showing m-values, fold changes and p values for pge synthases and cox- <dig> are presented in table  <dig> 

pge2-synthesizing enzymes and differentially expressed genes in selected significant go categories when comparing  <dig> h and  <dig> h of tnfα treatment. apositive m-values indicate genes up-regulated by tnfα, and negative m-values indicate genes down-regulated by tnfα between the  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points. bnot differentially expressed in the comparison between time-points  <dig> h and  <dig> h. differential expression is defined as p <  <dig> .

apositive m-values indicate up-regulated genes, and negative m-values indicate down-regulated genes. bnot differentially expressed in the comparison between time-points  <dig> h and  <dig> h. differential expression is defined as p <  <dig> .

when comparing the  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points, fewer go categories were significant than for the  <dig> h as well as  <dig> h to  <dig> h comparisons . of the two positively regulated signal cascades found in the  <dig> h to  <dig> h comparison, only "positive regulation of i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab cascade" was significantly changed between  <dig> h and  <dig> h. other significant categories between  <dig> h and  <dig> h were mainly immune related . for the three cell lines used, differential expression of the genes included in the go categories "positive regulation of jnk cascade" and "positive regulation of i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab cascade" in the  <dig> h to  <dig> h comparison is also displayed in a heat map in figure  <dig> 

since the focus of this study was on signal transduction pathways, we proceeded to further explore the potential role of the two positively regulated intracellular signaling pathways nf-κb and jnk, identified in the  <dig> h to  <dig> h comparison, in the regulation of tnfα-induced mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression. for this purpose, we investigated the effect of specific inhibitors of the jnk and nf-κb signal pathways on the expression of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> as well as on the phosphorylation of these two pathways.

involvement of jnk in the regulation of mpges- <dig> and cox-2
to investigate the involvement of the jnk signal pathway in tnfα-induced mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression and pge <dig> production, gingival fibroblasts were treated with the specific jnk inhibitor sp <dig>   <cit> . treatment of the cells with sp  together with tnfα decreased the protein expression of both mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig>  the latter to a higher extent, in  <dig> h cultures compared to cells treated with tnfα only, as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis in figure 6a. in addition, sp also decreased mpges- <dig> expression in control cells . to confirm the effect of sp, jnk phosphorylation analysis was performed in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h cultures of fibroblasts stimulated with tnfα in the presence of sp  as shown in figure 6b. the results, expressed as phosphorylated jnk  relative to control cells at  <dig> h, showed a peak in p-jnk at  <dig> h of incubation, as compared to unstimulated control cells . the tnfα-stimulated levels of p-jnk significantly decreased in the presence of sp , compared to cells treated with tnfα only, at all time points studied . furthermore, the effect of sp on p-jnk was also investigated at an earlier time point,  <dig> minutes after stimulation . the results, expressed as phosphorylated jnk  relative to control cells at the start of incubation, showed that the tnfα-stimulated level of p-jnk was decreased to control levels in the presence of sp . concurrent with the protein expression results of mpges- <dig>  the inhibitor  also decreased the production of pge <dig>  both in tnfα-stimulated cells and in control cells in  <dig> h cultures, as shown in figure 6d.

involvement of nf-κb in mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> regulation
in order to evaluate the role of nf-κb in the regulation of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression, the nf-κb pathway inhibitor bay 11- <dig>   <cit>  was used in the experiments. treatment of the cells with bay , decreased the tnfα-stimulated expression of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig>  the latter to a higher extent, in  <dig> h cultures, as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis . in addition, bay also slightly decreased mpges- <dig> expression in control cells . to confirm the inhibition of nf-κb by bay, the amount of phosphorylated nf-κb p <dig>  in fibroblasts stimulated with tnfα for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h was analyzed using p-nfκb-specific antibodies . the results, expressed as relative to control cells at the  <dig> h time point, showed a peak of p-nf-κb at  <dig> h of incubation with tnfα . treatment of the cells with bay  in combination with tnfα significantly decreased p-nf-κb in  <dig> h cultures, as demonstrated in figure 7b. the effect of bay on p-nf-κb was also studied at an earlier time point,  <dig> minutes after stimulation . the results, expressed as p-nf-κb relative to control cells at the start of incubation, showed that at the  <dig> minute time point, the tnfα-stimulated level of p-nf-κb was significantly decreased in the presence of bay . furthermore, bay  reduced the basal production of pge <dig>  compared to control cells in  <dig> h cultures . treatment of tnfα-stimulated cells with bay  had no effect on pge <dig> production in  <dig> h cultures , but the inhibitor  decreased the tnfα-stimulated pge <dig> production in  <dig> h cultures . to further confirm the involvement of nf-κb in the regulation of mpges- <dig>  cox- <dig> and pge <dig>  an additional inhibitor of nf-κb, ro 106- <dig>   <cit> , was used. treatment of the cells with ro , decreased the tnfα-stimulated expression of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> in  <dig> h cultures, as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis . concurrent with the protein expression results, the inhibitor  also decreased the production of pge <dig> in tnfα-stimulated cells in  <dig> h cultures, as shown in figure 8b.

discussion
pge <dig> is involved in numerous inflammatory associated diseases including the chronic inflammatory disease periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the global gene expression profile of tnfα-stimulated human gingival fibroblasts with a focus on signal transduction pathways related to the expression of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig>  we used a time-course factorial design for the oligonucleotide microarray hybridizations, which enabled us to statistically discern the interaction effect between the tnfα treatment and time aspect in the experiments studied. to our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the global gene expression profile of tnfα-stimulated gingival cells as an in vitro model of gingival inflammation. in the current study, we demonstrate a tnfα-stimulated up-regulation of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression, both at mrna and protein levels, accompanied by enhanced pge <dig> production. in addition, our microarray results showed a regulation of immune response, apoptosis and signal transduction gene categories in response to tnfα treatment of gingival fibroblasts, including positive regulation of the signal pathways jnk and nf-κb.

the tnfα up-regulated mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression, accompanied by increased pge <dig> production, is in line with our previously published results on gingival fibroblasts  <cit> . in contrast to the mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> enzymes, the expression of the pge synthases mpges- <dig> and cpges was not affected by tnfα treatment, highlighting the importance of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> in the regulation of inflammatory-induced pge <dig> production. however, when considering the similar kinetics of pge <dig> production and cox- <dig> expression, as well as the magnitude of cox- <dig> induction compared to mpges- <dig>  cox- <dig> seems to be the more important enzyme driving the tnfα induced pge <dig> production in gingival fibroblasts. increased pge <dig> production, via induction of the pge2-synthesizing enzymes mpges- <dig> or cox- <dig>  has also been reported in other cell types stimulated with tnfα, including synovial cells, chondrocytes and colonocytes  <cit> .

various intracellular signaling pathways have been reported to be involved in inflammatory-induced pge <dig> synthesis, mainly through regulation of cox- <dig>  which is the most widely studied enzyme of the pge <dig> synthesis chain. in contrast, limited reports exist regarding the regulation of the pge synthases downstream of cox- <dig>  to further explore the regulation of mpges- <dig> and related pge2-synthesizing enzymes in gingival fibroblasts, we here used a global gene expression profiling approach to achieve a broader view of the genes and signal pathways related to the regulation of mpges- <dig>  in parallel with cox- <dig>  using microarray analysis of tnfα-treated gingival fibroblasts. the effect of tnfα on global gene expression profiles has previously been investigated in synovial fibroblasts, preosteoblasts and hela cells, but not in gingival cells  <cit> . with regard to periodontal disease, microarray analysis of gingival tissue has been used in an attempt to define subclasses of periodontitis and to evaluate the effect of periodontal therapy  <cit> . in addition, blood cell gene expression profiling has been performed in subjects with aggressive periodontitis  <cit> . concerning gingival fibroblasts, microarray studies have been performed on unstimulated cells from healthy and inflamed gingival tissue, and on il-1β-stimulated immortalized cells  <cit> . however, a majority of the abovementioned microarray studies on cell cultures use only one time point of rna analysis after stimulation. in this work, using primary gingival fibroblasts, we employed a time-course factorial design to extract as much relevant information as possible from our data set. commonly, when using a simpler design for a time series experiment, it becomes difficult to relate the gene expression differences at the different time points to each other. this is greatly facilitated by the use of a time-course factorial design, which allows for the identification of the genes that are differentially regulated between the time points due to tnfα treatment  <cit> .

our results from the microarray analysis indicated the jnk and nf-κb pathways as possible targets for interrupting the tnfα-induced signal transduction leading to increased expression of the pge2-synthesizing enzymes mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig>  thus, we next further investigated the involvement of jnk and nf-κb in the tnfα-stimulated mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression. by using inhibitors specific for these signal pathways, we could demonstrate that jnk and nf-κb are partly involved in the complex network of intracellular signal transduction pathways leading to increased expression of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig>  as well as pge <dig> production, in response to the inflammatory cytokine tnfα. to our knowledge, this is the first study pointing out the involvement of jnk in up-regulation of mpges- <dig> expression in tnfα-stimulated cells. however, previous studies have shown that mpges- <dig> is stimulated by il-1β through the jnk pathway in cardiac myocytes, cardiac fibroblasts and a <dig> human lung epithelial cells  <cit> . in this study we also show that jnk is involved in tnfα-induced cox- <dig> expression in gingival fibroblasts, suggesting that jnk-dependent decrease of mpges- <dig> may not be the major event whereby the inhibition of this signal pathway exerts its effect on pge <dig> production. the finding that cox- <dig> expression was somewhat more influenced by inhibition of the jnk pathway, suggests that the jnk pathway may be more significant for cox- <dig> induction by tnfα in gingival fibroblasts. the involvement of jnk in tnfα-induced cox- <dig> expression is in line with results obtained from human alveolar epithelial cells and murine osteoblasts  <cit> . similarly, il-1β- and lipopolysaccharide-induced cox- <dig> has been shown to be mediated through jnk in other cell types  <cit> . in contrast, it has also been reported that cox- <dig> expression induced by epidermal growth factor is unaffected by jnk inhibition in astrocytes, emphasizing the differences between cell types as well as the inflammatory stimuli used for investigation of signal transduction pathways  <cit> .

the jnk pathway has been implicated in chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> . moreover, jnk- <dig> deficiency as well as chemical jnk inhibition has been demonstrated to prevent joint destruction in rodent models of rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . thus, our novel finding that jnk is partly involved in the regulation of tnfα-induced mpges- <dig> expression, which in concert with cox- <dig> regulates pge <dig> production in gingival fibroblasts, indicates that this signal pathway may also be of importance in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

in addition to the jnk pathway, we also found that the nf-κb pathway was involved in the regulation of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> in gingival fibroblasts stimulated with tnfα. our results pointing out the nf-κb pathway in the regulation of mpges- <dig> are in line with our previous observations  <cit> . induction of mpges- <dig> expression using another inflammatory mediator, il-1β, has been reported to be mediated by nf-κb in a <dig> cells  <cit> . in regard to cox- <dig> regulation, the involvement of the nf-κb pathway in the signal transduction of tnfα-induced cox- <dig> expression has been observed in other cell types, including endothelial cells and astrocytes  <cit> . concerning pge <dig> production, no decrease was observed in tnfα-stimulated pge <dig> production in  <dig> h cultures, in contrast to the inhibition observed in  <dig> h cultures. one reason for the lack of inhibition of pge <dig> in  <dig> h cultures by the nf-κb inhibitor bay, in contrast to mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression, may be a toxic effect of the inhibitor, affecting the release of pge <dig> although no visual signs of cellular toxicity were observed. however, when using the nf-κb inhibitor ro, reported to inhibit nf-κb via selective inhibition of tnfα-induced iκbα  <cit> , it decreased the tnfα-stimulated expression of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> as well as the production of pge <dig> in  <dig> h cultures. furthermore, both the nf-κb inhibitors bay and ro as well as the jnk inhibitor sp decreased the basal expression of mpges- <dig> in cells not treated with tnfα, which might be due to slightly raised basal levels of mpges- <dig> expression resulting from a lingering effect of the serum present in growth medium before the start of cell culture experiments.

a time-course factorial microarray analysis, like the one performed in this work, yields massive amounts of data. in this study we have focused on the signal transduction aspect, especially the jnk and nf-κb pathways, in order to investigate the regulation of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression in relation to pge <dig> production. inhibition of jnk and nf-κb signal pathways by sp and ro abolished the production of pge <dig>  although the induction of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> by tnfα was not completely abrogated. one explanation for this might be that other enzymes may contribute to the production of pge <dig> stimulated by tnfα. for instance, it is known that the signal pathways jnk and nf-κb, in addition to the cox- <dig> and mpges- <dig> enzymes, are also involved in the regulation of cpla <dig>  an upstream key enzyme of the pge <dig> synthesis reported to be induced by tnfα in gingival fibroblasts  <cit> . another explanation for the strong inhibition of pge <dig> production, in contrast to the partial reduction of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression, may be a synergistic effect of the concerted inhibition of these two enzymes, since they are functionally coupled and responsible for the coordinated pge <dig> synthesis  <cit> . in addition, one has to be aware that the jnk and nf-κb pathways activated by tnfα may not be entirely responsible for the increased expression of mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig>  there are many additional tnfα-regulated genes and pathways involved in the regulation of inflammatory conditions, including pge <dig> regulatory enzymes, that merit further study, and investigations are ongoing to continue charting the genome-wide effect of tnfα on gingival fibroblasts.

CONCLUSIONS
we here present for the first time a gene expression profiling approach to explore the signal pathways involved in the tnfα-stimulated pge <dig> production and mpges- <dig> and cox- <dig> expression in gingival fibroblasts. in the global gene expression profile, the enrichment analysis of microarray data identified the two signal transduction pathways jnk and nf-κb as positively regulated by the inflammatory cytokine tnfα. inhibitors of the jnk and nf-κb pathways reduced the tnfα-stimulated expression of mpges- <dig> and to a higher extent cox- <dig>  accompanied by abolished pge <dig> production. altogether, the microarray and phosphorylation data provide insight into the regulatory network of signal pathways related to pge synthase, cox- <dig> and pge <dig> production in gingival fibroblasts. the involvement of jnk and nf-κb in the regulation of pge <dig> production induced by tnfα in gingival fibroblasts suggests these two signal pathways as key elements in the inflammatory-induced pge <dig> production in gingiva, and also as possible attractive targets in the chronic inflammatory disease periodontitis.
