BACKGROUND
phlebotomine sandflies are vectors of leishmania parasites, causal agents of leishmaniasis in at least  <dig> countries. the manifestations of this disease range from the self-healing cutaneous and mucocutaneous forms to the potentially fatal visceral form. the incidence of leishmaniasis is  <dig> million cases annually, of which  <dig>  cases are visceral and potentially lethal  <cit> . visceral leishmaniasis is caused by parasites of the leishmania donovani complex: l. donovani, l. infantum and l. chagasi . there are a limited number of competent sandfly vectors that can transmit parasites within this complex. for example, phlebotomus argentipes transmits only l. donovani in the india sub-continent, p. ariasi and p. perniciosus transmit l. infantum within southern europe, and lutzomyia longipalpis exclusively transmits l. chagasi  in central and south america.

infected sandflies deliver the leishmania parasite to a mammalian host during blood meal acquisition. together with the parasite, sandflies inject saliva into the host. this saliva contains potent pharmacologically active components that facilitate blood feeding  <cit> . additionally, the saliva affects the establishment of the parasite within the vertebrate host; small amount of l. longipalpis saliva exacerbates l. major infection in mice  <cit> . on the other hand, immune responses to sandfly saliva have been shown to protect against leishmania infection  <cit> . antibodies to maxadilan, a salivary protein from the sandfly l. longipalpis protected mice against l. major infection  <cit> , while cellular immune response to ppsp <dig>  a protein from the sandfly p. papatasi was sufficient to control l. major infection in mice  <cit> . therefore, immune responses to salivary protein have promise as an effective vector-based vaccine to control leishmania infection.

the repertoire of sandfly salivary proteins that have been studied is largely limited to three sandflies: p. papatasi, p. ariasi and l. longipalpis, vectors of l major, l. infantum and l. chagasi , respectively. only two salivary proteins have been extensively studied: maxadilan from the sandfly l. longipalpis, and ppsp <dig> from the sandfly p. papatasi. maxadilan, a potent vasodilatory, immunomodulatory and protective molecule was shown to be very polymorphic  <cit> . on the other hand, ppsp <dig>  a protective molecule with unknown biological function was shown to be highly conserved among colonized or field-collected p. papatasi sandflies  <cit> .

because of the potential of sandfly salivary proteins as anti-leishmania vaccines, it is important to understand the diversity and degree of similarity between salivary proteins from various sandflies. more importantly, understanding the evolutionary relatedness of salivary proteins will help us to identify proteins that can be used as a global or general anti-leishmania vaccine within a complex of vector species.

here we explored the proteins and transcripts encoded in the salivary glands of the sandflies p. argentipes and p. perniciosus and studied the repertoire of proteins on these sandflies and compared them with the p. ariasi and l. longipalpis salivary proteins, also vectors of visceral leishmaniasis. we studied their molecular characteristics in the relation to molecular evolution of sandfly salivary proteins, and in the context of possible scenarios for global vector-based vaccines strategies.

RESULTS
sequencing of p. argentipes and p. perniciosus salivary gland cdna libraries
from the p. argentipes salivary gland cdna library, we sequenced  <dig> randomly selected clones from which  <dig> unique clusters of related sequences were obtained. out of the  <dig> clusters, we found  <dig> clusters  of transcripts coding for housekeeping genes. we found  <dig> sequences, arranged in  <dig> clusters  that were not similar to other genes in the ncbi databank and lacked a secretory signal peptide. the most abundant transcripts in this cdna library contained putative secretory proteins. we found  <dig> cdna with potentially secreted proteins signals arranged in  <dig> clusters . the number of cdna coding for secretory proteins is  <dig> times greater than the cdna coding for housekeeping genes and  <dig> times greater than the cdna coding for non-secreted proteins with unknown function. the transcripts coding for secretory proteins represent 73% of the total transcripts sequenced in the p. argentipes salivary gland library.

similarly, the most abundant transcripts found in the p. perniciosus salivary gland cdna library coded for secretory proteins. from a total of  <dig> sequenced cdna we found that  <dig> cdna were potentially secreted and were grouped into  <dig> clusters . the cdna coding for secretory proteins represent 74% of the cdna sequenced, while transcripts coding for housekeeping genes represent  <dig>  % . an additional  <dig> %  of transcripts coded for unknown  proteins. table  <dig> and table  <dig> contain the results of the analysis of the transcripts coding for secreted proteins from the salivary glands of p. argentipes and p. perniciosus.

in addition to the identification of proteins previously reported from other sandflies, we found a number of transcripts coding for proteins not previously shown to be present in the salivary glands of sandflies. a protein homologous to lipases from anopheles gambiae, drosophila melanogaster and other organisms was found in the p. argentipes cdna library. we also found in this library and in the p. perniciosus cdna library, a transcript coding for a protein homologous to a pyrophosphatase. the predicted 47-kda protein named pagsp <dig> contains a phosphodiesterase type i, phosphodiesterase/nucleotide pyrophosphatase motif. this type of enzymes cleaves the phosphodiester and phosphosulfate bonds in nad, deoxynucleotides and nucleotide sugars  <cit> . blast search of this protein identified protein orthologs found in mammals as well as in a. gambiae. to our knowledge, pyrophosphatases have not been described in the saliva of other sandflies.

we found one cluster in the p. perniciosus cdna library coding for a phospholipase a <dig>  protein . this type of protein has never been reported from the saliva of a blood-feeding insect. pla <dig>  are well known for their ability to cleave the arachidonic acid and lysophosphatidylcholine from the sn- <dig> position of membrane glycerol-3-phospholipids. also pla <dig> are known to work as toxins by blocking the release of neurotransmitters  <cit> .

we identified transcripts coding for secreted proteins that did not match any reported proteins in accessible databases. p. argentipes contained six unknown proteins that ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> kda, while only three were found in the p. perniciosus library and all were relatively small ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda .

proteome analysis of p. argentipes and p. perniciosus salivary proteins
edman degradation of the salivary proteins separated by sds-page from p. argentipes resulted in the identification of  <dig> n-terminal sequences . the identified proteins included three ppsp15-like protein , d7-related protein , ppsp32-like salivary protein , antigen  <dig> related proteins , a novel protein , p. papatasi apyrase-like protein , l. longipalpis 32-kda-like salivary protein , and a yellow-related protein . three proteins with different mobility on the gel had the same n-terminal sequence , and were probably derived from the same transcript but with different post-translational modifications.

from p. perniciosus salivary gland protein analysis we found  <dig> n-terminus sequences . the identified proteins included: three ppsp15-like proteins , three d7-related proteins , a 37-kda-like protein described previously in the saliva of l. longipalpis , an antigen- <dig> related protein , two apyrase-like proteins , a 32-kda-like salivary protein described on l. longipalpis  and two yellow-related proteins . not all attempted edman degradation experiments resulted in a sequence, either because of insufficient protein amount or because n-terminal ends were blocked.

comparative analysis of salivary transcripts from vectors of visceral leishmaniasis: p. argentipes, p. perniciosus, p. ariasi and l. longipalpis
in an attempt to understand the relationship of salivary proteins among different sandflies and to gain insights into the evolution of sandfly salivary proteins, we compared cdna libraries from four different sandflies. we selected the sandflies based on their availability and their significance for this study. first, we selected sandflies from the two different genera, phlebotomus and lutzomyia. secondly, from the phlebotomus genus we selected two different subgenus, euphlebotomus  and larroussius . the phylogenetic relationship among these sandflies was previously studied using the small subunit nuclear ribosomal dna  <cit> .

full-length secreted proteins from each sandfly library were compared using a stand alone version of blast. we found  <dig> families of proteins that are common among all four cdna libraries: 1) ppsp <dig> like protein, 2) apyrase-like, 3) yellow related protein, 4) antigen- <dig> related protein, 5) ppsp <dig> like protein, 6)  <dig> kda-like protein, 7) d <dig> related protein and 8) an endonuclease-like protein, 9) a 39-kda-like protein, and a  <dig>  kda-like protein . the level of similarities according to blast values was highly significant . the protein families listed above may be common to both lutzomyia and phlebotomus species, and may be present in other species from both genera.

it is interesting to note the amount of variation that exists in the number of members of the different protein families found in the four sandflies . the ppsp15-like family has five members identified in p. argentipes , two in p. ariasi , three in p. perniciosus , yet only one  in l. longipalpis . on the other hand, only one member of the apyrase family of proteins has been found in each sandfly except for p. perniciosus, which has two members . other families of salivary proteins, such as antigen  <dig>  ppsp <dig>   <dig> kda and endonuclease-like protein were represented by only one member from each of the different sandflies. the yellow-related protein has one member found in p. argentipes, two members in the p. perniciosus and p. ariasi and three members in the lutzomyia longipalpis sandfly. the d7-related protein was represented by three members in phlebotomus sandflies, while only one member is present in the l. longipalpis sandfly.

through comparative analysis we found at least one unique transcript from each of the four cdna libraries. nine unique transcripts were identified in p. argentipes, five in p. ariasi, one in p. perniciosus and twenty-four in l. longipalpis. the large difference in l. longipalpis may be due to genus differences ; therefore, we would expect to find similar transcripts in other lutzomyia species. only four families of proteins were unique to phlebotomus: a 32-kda protein of unknown function, a 2-kda peptide, a 5-kda peptide and a phospholipase a2-like protein .

molecular characteristics of salivary proteins shared among the analysed sandflies
in order to understand the relationship among salivary proteins from different sandflies, we performed multiple sequence alignment followed by phylogenetic analysis of the salivary transcripts shared by the vectors of visceral leishmaniasis studied . following is a description of the shared proteins:

sl1/ppsp <dig> related proteins
the sl1/ppsp <dig> group of proteins is similar to the sl <dig> salivary protein from l. longipalpis, which has no known function  <cit> , and to ppsp <dig>  a 15- kda salivary protein from phlebotomus papatasi that was previously shown to confer protection against l. major infection  <cit> . the predicted molecular weight of these transcripts is approximately  <dig> kda and is in agreement with the observed mw found through the proteome analysis . this group represents the most abundant transcripts in the salivary gland cdna library of p. argentipes . the fact that only one ppsp <dig> member was found in l. longipalpis, suggests that a number of lineage-specific gene expansions  occurred in the phlebotomus lineage at various periods in the evolution of these sandflies.

the ppsp <dig> family of proteins has only been found in species of sandflies suggesting that this family was a specific invention that occurred during sandfly evolution, most likely during their adaptation to a blood-feeding environment. although psi-blast analysis using ppsp <dig> proteins retrieved only members of the ppsp <dig> family, the phyre prediction servers indicated that members of the ppsp <dig> family possess an ef-hand fold most closely related to members of the odorant-binding protein  family to which the d7-proteins belong. it is thus likely that ppsp <dig> members were derived from an obp ancestral protein. characteristically, the obp family in drosophila has a low degree of sequence similarity among its members with only six conserved cysteines among the thirty-four members of this family  <cit> .

the multiple pair-wise alignment analysis of sandfly ppsp <dig> shows a high degree of divergence among the sequences,  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity . the number of amino acids between the second and third cysteine  and between the fifth and the sixth cysteine  were shown to be conserved among all the drosophila obp members  <cit> . all of the sandflies sequences analysed from the ppsp <dig> protein family contained identical cysteine positioning. this data suggests that this family of proteins may be closely related to the short form of d <dig> because of the similarities to obp and its small size of  <dig> kda, which is similar to the mw found in the mosquitoes short d <dig>  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of ppsp <dig> transcripts from the different sandflies including p. papatasi resulted in the formation of  <dig> distinct clades . as such, three major clusters of orthologous groups of proteins , and hence gene duplication events, can be identified that possibly occurred in the ancestor to the phlebotomus lineage. cog <dig> includes members from p. perniciosus, p. argentipes and p. papatasi with a second related clade that includes a lineage-specific expansion  in p. papatasi. cog <dig> includes members from p. perniciosus and p. argentipes. cog <dig> includes members from p. perniciosus, p. argentipes and p. ariasi. another clade composed solely of members of p. argentipes indicates another lse. evolutionarily, the p. papatasi group was basal to the other phlebotomus members analysed in this study, followed by p. argentipes, with p. perniciosus and p. ariasi forming the terminal clade. given this, the topology of the cladogram obtained for the ppsp <dig> family suggests that cog <dig> resulted from gene duplication event that occurred in the ancestor to p. perniciosus and p. ariasi. cog <dig> follows the expected phylogenetic grouping but suggests that this gene was lost in p. ariasi or we failed to detect the ortholog in our library. cog <dig> again suggests that this specific gene duplication event occurred after divergence from the shared ancestor with p. papatasi. the ppsp <dig> family found in sandflies is thus characterised by both gene duplication and possibly gene loss events, both restricting an accurate reconstruction of its phylogeny. it is currently impossible to say which proteins share a conserved function with the ppsp <dig> from l. longipalpis as the major clades create a polytomy. as such, this family might bind related or similar pharmacologic components so that they all have, in fact, a similar function. this might explain the seemingly haphazard acquisition and loss of genes.

d <dig> family of proteins
d7-related proteins are found in the saliva of different diptera, including anopheles  <cit> , aedes  <cit>  and culex  <cit>  mosquitoes as well as in the sandflies p. papatasi  <cit> , l. longipalpis  <cit>  and p. ariasi  <cit>  and does not appear to occur in non-dipteran species. two forms of the protein have been described; a long and short form  <cit> ; and appear to be distantly related to an odorant binding super family of proteins. interestingly, the obp family seems to be the ancestral molecule of the ppsp <dig> family . therefore, it may be possible that both d <dig> and ppsp <dig> related proteins have a common ancestor.

the d <dig> protein named hamadarin from anopheles stephensi acts as an anticoagulant affecting the plasma contact system by inhibiting the activation of factor xii and kallikrein  <cit> . recently, a biological function of four short members of the d <dig> family from a. gambiae and a long d <dig> from aedes aegypti was described  <cit> . these salivary proteins were shown to bind biogenic amines such as serotonin, histamine and norepinephrine. this function is relevant for blood-feeding because of the inhibition of the vasoconstrictor, platelet aggregating, and pain inducing properties of these biogenic amines  <cit> . the exact function of d <dig> proteins in sandflies is largely unknown, but it may be related to the function observed in mosquito d <dig> proteins, either as an anticoagulant or binding biogenic amines.

the d <dig> family is represented in the p. argentipes cdna library by two members, pagsp <dig> and pagsp <dig>  and in the p. perniciosus cdna library by three members, ppesp <dig>  ppesp04b and ppesp <dig>  only one member of this family is present in l. longipalpis sandfly, suggesting a case of gene duplication of this protein that probably occurred more recently in the phlebotomus genus.

comparative analysis of the d <dig> family of proteins from different sandflies reveals few conserved regions of identity, with only 16% identity and 23% similarity between the sandfly d <dig> proteins. there are  <dig> conserved cysteines throughout the molecule. the size of the sandfly d <dig> proteins is slightly smaller than the long d <dig> forms found in mosquitoes. additionally, sandfly d <dig> is missing the last cysteine that is present at the carboxy terminal region of the mosquito long- and short-form d <dig> and, instead, have a cysteine present between conserved cysteines  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . based on phyre prediction results, the long-form d <dig> proteins have  <dig> alpha helix domains, the short form have  <dig> alpha helix domains, while the sandfly form have  <dig> domains. all three forms are associated to obp, as mentioned above. interestingly, the sandfly d <dig> proteins are predicted to contain a beta-strand domain starting at the 7th cysteine and characterised by a repeat of tyrosines at amino acid  <dig> , replacing the alpha helix domain found in the mosquito d <dig> proteins at the same position. due to these differences we are categorising the sandfly d <dig> as the medium form .

phylogenetic analysis of d <dig> proteins from different organisms shows  <dig> distinct clades with the sandfly proteins branching from the long form . all of the sandfly d <dig> members are clustered within one clade, distinct from the long form members. the clade containing the mosquito d <dig> short-form proteins contains two clusters, one containing the anopheles mosquitoes and the other containing the culex and aedes species. the sandfly clade subdivides into two distinct clades. the lower clade shows  <dig> distinct groups, two of these groups represent cogs of p. perniciosus and p. ariasi, and the group of p. papatasi seems to be a case of lineage expansion. the lower clade shows a cog that includes p. argentipes, p. ariasi and p. perniciosus proteins, pagsp <dig>  parsp <dig> and ppesp <dig> 

apyrase family of proteins
both the p. perniciosus and p. argentipes libraries contained transcripts homologous to the cimex family of apyrases  <cit> , a protein also present in the saliva of p. papatasi  <cit>  and l. longipalpis  <cit> . apyrases are enzymes that function as potent anti-platelet factors by destroying or hydrolysing the platelet activator adp. an orthologue was found in humans and the recombinant protein was shown to hydrolyse a variety of nucleoside di- and triphosphates, preferentially udp, followed by gdp, utp, gtp, adp, and atp  <cit> .

sequence alignment of the p. argentipes,p. perniciosus and p. ariasi apyrases show a 47% identity and 81% similarity at the amino acid level . when l. longipalpis is included in the analysis, there is a considerable decrease in the identity  as well as in the similarity  .

phylogenetic analysis of apyrases from different organisms indicates three main clades with the sandfly apyrases in a distinct clade, apart from vertebrates, yet closely related to other insects . interestingly sandfly apyrases share a common ancestor with cimex lectularius apyrase. the two insects appear to have evolved to the blood feeding mode independently  <cit> . within the clade containing the sandflies, one of the p. perniciosus apyrases, ppesp <dig>  is more closely related to the p. ariasi apyrase  than the second apyrase from p. perniciosus . this may be the result of a gene duplication event in p. perniciosus and subsequent loss in p. ariasi. when searching databases we found a transcript from a. gambiae similar to sandfly apyrases. this is interesting because the known mosquito apyrases belong to the 5'-nucleotidase family of proteins. the known mosquito apyrase is very distinct, in size and sequence, from the cimex family of apyrases also present in sandflies  <cit> , thus it is possible that mosquitoes in addition to a functional 5'-nucleotidase type apyrase, may have a non-functional sandfly/bedbug-like apyrase gene or it may have a house keeping function such as hydrolysing udp formed after transglycosylation reactions in the golgi  <cit> . alternatively, the mosquito may have a similar apyrase but with different substrate specificity or this protein is not present in their salivary gland.

interestingly, the mosquito apyrase gene seems to be ancestral to the sandfly apyrase based on phylogenetic association . then it may be possible that mosquitoes have lost the function of this gene and kept the active form of the 5'-nucleotidase gene, which is the active apyrase in these insects.

the crystal structure of the cimex family of apyrases was elucidated from the human counterpart and the amino acids relevant for calcium- and nucleotide-binding sites were determined  <cit> . several differences were noted among the amino acids relevant for nucleotide- or calcium-binding between sandflies, bedbugs and humans  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the alignment of the different apyrases with amino acids relevant for calcium- and nucleotide-binding highlighted. we observed clear differences in some of these amino acids when sandflies were compared with other organisms including mosquitoes. the amino acids at position  <dig> are ser , thr  or ala , in sandflies and met  or leu  in other organisms . amino acids at position  <dig> is met , ile  or leu  in sandflies and lys  in other organisms; at position  <dig>  sandflies have either lys , tyr  or leu  and other organisms have only thr . at position  <dig>  sandflies and bedbugs have a trp  while other organisms have ile . amino acid substitutions may produce the specificity of the sandfly apyrases to adp, a molecule that these insects must hydrolyse to overcome the hemostatic system and take a successful blood meal. in fact, dai et al  <cit>  showed that amino acid substitutions at some positions changed the substrate  in human apyrase. human apyrases have more affinity for gdp substrate while sandfly apyrases have affinity for adp  <cit> .

yellow-related protein
the gene coding for the yellow protein was first described in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . the proteins in this family appear to be derived from a common ancestor of the major royal jelly proteins  from honeybees and the yellow protein from drosophila spp.

drosophila yellow protein is related to pigmentation and male sexual behavior. in the family culicidae a yellow protein was identified in ae. aegypti whole-larvae extract and was associated to a dopachrome converting enzyme activity found in this insect  <cit> . the function of this protein in the saliva of sandflies and its importance for blood feeding remains to be elucidated. the yellow protein family is one of the most abundant proteins found in the sandfly saliva.

we identified transcripts coding for secreted proteins of approximately  <dig> kda, previously described in the saliva of l. longipalpis, p. papatasi and p. ariasi as yellow-related proteins  <cit> . in the p. argentipes cdna library we found only one cluster  coding for this protein, yet in p. papatasi and l. longipalpis salivary glands there are multiple members of this family of proteins  <cit> . proteomic analysis  revealed that the pagsp <dig> transcript  was one of the most abundant proteins found in the salivary glands of p. argentipes. interestingly, three proteins with different mobilities coded for the same n-terminus sequence  suggesting they may represent the same protein with different post-translational modifications.

based on comparative analysis, we identified ten different sandfly salivary proteins that are members of the yellow family. alignment of yellow proteins from phlebotomus sandflies , revealed a 43% identity and 79% similarity among the members of this protein family . when the three yellow proteins from l. longipalpis were added, the identity was 21% identity and similarity was 57% among these proteins . the phylogenetic analysis based on maximum likelihood using amino acid data of several mrjp/yellow proteins resulted in the formation of various clades , one clade containing yellow proteins from honeybees, a second clade containing mosquitoes and drosophila, and a third clade containing the yellow proteins from sandflies. the sandfly clade was subdivided into three sub-clades, one containing the two yellow proteins from p. papatasi, the second clade containing the yellow proteins from p. ariasi and p. pernicious, and the third clade containing the l. longipalpis yellow proteins.

based on their mw, the yellow proteins from l. longipalpis appear to be the most recognised proteins from the sera of individuals living in endemic areas of visceral leishmaniasis and from individuals that have anti-leishmania immunity  <cit> . the antibody response against these salivary proteins appears to correlate with protection against leishmaniasis.

antigen- <dig> family of proteins
this cluster codes for a secreted protein of  <dig> kda similar to antigen 5-related protein found in wasp venom  <cit> . similar proteins have been isolated from the salivary glands of aedes aegypti  <cit> , an. gambiae  <cit>  and from the salivary glands of l. longipalpis  <cit> . we found only one cluster coding for this protein in the cdna library of p. argentipes  and in the cdna library of p. perniciosus . the n-terminal sequence corresponding to these transcripts was identified in the salivary glands of p. argentipes  and p. perniciosus .

this family of proteins belong to the cap family  of proteins  <cit> . a remarkable feature of this family is the large number of cysteine residues, particularly at the carboxy-terminal region. x-ray structure of na-as- <dig>  a member of this family from the human hookworm necator americanus, was recently reported  <cit>  and showed structural similarities to chemokines. thus, it is possible that this type of protein in sandflies or other insects may bind cytokines with potential effects on the host immune response.

multiple alignments of the antigen- <dig> protein from the sandflies indicated a 49% identity and 80% similarity  with fourteen conserved cysteines. phylogenetic analysis identified unique clades containing hymenoptera, culicidae, sandflies and mammals . the only other organism included in the sandfly clade was the biting midge culicoides sonorensis.

33-kda protein family
the 33-kda protein family does not appear to be related to any other known proteins found in genbank. phlebotomus ariasi and p. perniciosus, 33-kda proteins, are more closely related to each other than to p. argentipes, whereas the 33-kda protein from l. longipalpis is distant to the three phlebotomus species . in general, all four sequences are somewhat similar with only 34% shared amino acids . without further investigation, the function of this protein is unknown.

endonuclease family of proteins
transcripts coding for an endonuclease-like protein were found in p. argentipes  and p. perniciosus  salivary gland cdna libraries. these transcripts code for a protein of approximately  <dig> kda with similarities to non-specific endonucleases from the sandfly l. longipalpis  <cit> , tse tse fly glossina morsitans  <cit> , and the mosquito culex pipiens quinquefasciatus  <cit> . this transcript does not have a direct match with the nuc smart motif, which is indicative dna/rna non-specific endonucleases and phosphodiesterases, but it does have a high homology with other known endonucleases from other arthropods such as d. melanogaster  as well as non-insect arthropods such as p. camtschaticus   and m. japonicus   .

endonuclease proteins were found in all sandflies studied. the multiple alignment of sandfly endonuclease showed various regions of identity among amino acids, and many regions of conserved amino acids, even when comparing endonucleases from different sandfly genera . phylogenetic analysis indicated that the sandfly endonucleases clustered  with other arthropods, including two non-insect arthropods  , however, sandfly endonucleases formed a distinct clade within the arthropod cluster . additionally, these endonucleases were clearly distant from other endonucleases. this suggests that this endonuclease may represent a common antigen for different sandflies and that the distant relationship to other endonucleases may avoid potential cross reactivity with non-insect organisms. since this type of enzyme can cleave double- and single-stranded dna, the role of this protein in the saliva of sandflies should be investigated further.

ppsp32-like protein
the ppsp32-like family of proteins is similar to the  <dig> -kda protein first identified in p. papatasi salivary glands  <cit> . we found only one cluster  coding for this protein in the p. argentipes cdna library. blast analysis of pagsp <dig> identified significant homology to l. longipalpis and p. papatasi ppsp32-like proteins. the p. perniciosus cdna library contained only one cluster  sharing identity with the ppsp32-like protein. interestingly, upon blast analysis the ppsp32-like protein from p. perniciosus was found to be highly homologous to a type vii collagen protein from canis familiaris  as well as a collagen from mus musculus, rattus norvegicus, chinese hamster, and bos taurus. this homology was found along approximately  <dig> amino acids  and was dominated by conserved glycines and prolines .

the role of a collagen-like protein in sandfly salivary glands is unknown, yet intriguing. because this protein may bind matrix protein, it is possible that this type of protein may form strong associations with basal matrix proteins. within the phlebotomus genera the relationship to collagen appears to be limited to ppsp <dig> kda-like proteins from p. pernicious. p. papatasi and p. ariasi share only weak  homology with type vii collagen  and p. argentipes did not match any collagen proteins upon multiple blast searches.

one explanation for the apparent homology between the four sandflies studied, yet lack of identity between collagen-related proteins in all sandflies, was revealed in the comparative analysis of the four sandflies. the majority of the homology between the four sandflies was found at the n- and carboxy terminus whereas the middle section of the protein appeared to be less conserved. the n-terminal and carboxy terminus has 43% and 23% identity between the four flies, respectively, whereas the midsection of the protein contains only 4% identity . the region of homology between p. perniciosus and type vii collagen was found in the non-homologous region of the protein .

additionally, blast analysis of l. longipalpis ljl <dig>  revealed a significant homology to collagen adhesion proteins from b. thuringiensis  and b. cereus  . again, the region of homology was found in the divergent section of the ppsp32-kda protein. the most perplexing aspect of this family of proteins is that, although highly conserved among the four sandflies studied here, the n-terminal and carboxy regions of the protein have no homology to proteins of known function.

perspectives on the evolution of hematophagy in sandflies
the presence of a specific gene in distantly related species could indicate a true orthologous relationship  or acquisition of the gene by one of the species by horizontal gene transfer. while horizontal gene transfer is a common event in prokaryotes its provenance in eukaryotes is not well established and the general consensus is that its occurrence is rare, if present at all. in the case of sandflies this would imply that proteins present in evolutionary distant species  were present in the ancestral sandfly. as such, two general trends can be observed for the sandfly protein families found in their transcriptomes. firstly, those proteins that occur throughout the metazoans or insecta tend to be found as single members in all sandfly genera with no extensive gene duplication events occurring in sandflies. these proteins are generally well conserved and possibly share the same or a very similar function to those found in the main family. these proteins include the apyrase, antigen  <dig> and endonuclease families and probably consist of the core repertoire of the ancestral sandfly proteins that develop during adaptation to hematophagous behavior. although yellow-related proteins and d <dig> proteins are generally well conserved, we observed some gene expansion of these proteins in sandflies .

alternatively, a number of protein families are limited to sandflies as a group or specific species and show low levels of similarity to family members found in other insects. members of this group show high levels of divergence, more gene duplication events and were probably evolved specifically during adaptation to a blood-feeding lifestyle and specific host species. proteins in this category include the psp <dig> like, psp <dig> like,  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and  <dig>  kda protein families  within this group can also be placed the singletons, which are proteins limited exclusively to single species . in the case of the  <dig> kda and  <dig>  kda families , it is possible that gene losses occurred among selected sandfly species or the sequences or transcripts were missed on this analysis due to low representation of these transcripts in the sandflies studied. in the case of the 2- and 5-kda salivary proteins only found in p. ariasi and p. perniciosus , these proteins may be specific for the subgenus larroussius. we found many transcripts in the p. argentipes and l. longipalpis cdna libraries coding for proteins of similar mw, however with no significant homology to these two proteins.

as expected, we found that salivary proteins from sand flies belonging to the same subgenus are more closely related to each other than proteins from different subgenus. we observed that proteins belonging to p. ariasi  in all phylogenetic tree analysis based on protein sequence were more closely related to p. perniciosus  than to p. argentipes salivary proteins . these results are in agreement with previously studies using the small subunit nuclear ribosomal dna  <cit> .

can we use the salivary proteins common to these four sandflies as global antigens for a vector-based vaccine?
the large degree of divergence found in the majority of the most abundant sandfly salivary proteins suggests that a specific salivary protein may not be used as common vaccine target or as a common marker for sandfly exposure to different sandfly genera. this is supported by the recent findings by rohousova et al  <cit> , who compared antibody responses to salivary proteins from p. papatasi, p. sergenti and l. longipalpis and also demonstrated a lack of cross-reactivity between animals bitten by two different sandfly genera. this lack of cross-reactivity is possibly due to the low degree of similarities found in the lutzomyia and phlebotomus salivary proteins, as reported in the present work, and to the lack of recognition to specific molecules present exclusively in the different genera. we cannot exclude at this point potential cross-reactivity, or lack thereof, with components of the cellular immune response to sandfly salivary proteins. this area has been under-studied and should be evaluated experimentally. although there is an overall low degree of identity between most salivary proteins across the genera, there are small regions of identities that may contain common t cell epitopes conserved between lutzomyia and phlebotomus salivary proteins. these small regions are observed in proteins such as d <dig>  apyrases, yellow-related protein, antigen  <dig>  a 33-kda protein and endonucleases from these sandflies studied thus far.

in contrast, we found salivary proteins that have the potential to be a common vaccine target within the genus phlebotomus. we identified three proteins that are highly conserved in different phlebotomus species, the yellow-related protein, the apyrases and the antigen 5-related proteins. additionally, these proteins have the potential to be markers of exposure for phlebotomus sandflies in general. this is supported by observations by rohousova et al  <cit>  and volf and rohousova  <cit> , which showed some cross-reactivity in animals to salivary proteins between different phlebotomus species. these observations need to be expanded and evaluated experimentally for the potential cross-reactivity of these salivary proteins on specific cellular immune responses that may protect against leishmania infection.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, this study led us to the identification of novel salivary proteins from two sandfly vectors of visceral leishmaniasis, p. argentipes and p. perniciosus, and the identification of the overall repertoire of secreted proteins present in their salivary glands. additionally, this study allowed the discovery of the salivary proteins common among four different sandflies, from two different genera  and from two different subgenera . this comparative study is giving us insight into the evolution of sandfly salivary proteins, their relationship and their molecular characteristics.

moreover, this study is providing a better understanding of the overall sequence identity of sandfly salivary proteins across genus and species, while suggesting that a global vector-based vaccine may not be possible across different genera and that possibly genus- or species-specific salivary proteins may need to be used for this type of vaccine.
