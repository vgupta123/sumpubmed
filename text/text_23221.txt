BACKGROUND
iron is required by a wide variety of intracellular bacterial pathogens to achieve full virulence. deprivation of iron in-vivo and in-vitro severely reduces the pathogenicity of mycobacterium tuberculosis, coxiella burnettii, legionella pneumophila, and salmonella typhimurium  <cit> . attempts to withhold iron by sequestering free iron during infection is a major defense strategy used by many species  <cit> . inflammatory signaling cascades during infection lead to a reduction in available free iron and sequestration of iron in the reticuloendothelial system   <cit> . on the other hand, iron is needed by host cells for cellular functions and first line defense mechanisms  <cit> . iron homeostasis also affects macrophage and lymphocyte effector pathways of the innate and adaptive immune response  <cit> .

iron homeostasis in the macrophage is determined by uptake processes through lactoferrin, transferrin, divalent metal transporter , phagocytosis of senescent erythrocytes, and by export through ferroportin   <cit> . transferrin and its receptor  play an important role during infection of macrophages with bacterial pathogens that prefer an intracellular lifestyle. expression of tfr <dig> can in turn be modulated by bacterial infections  <cit> . intracellular bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis and ehrlichia  <cit>  actively recruit tfr <dig> to the bacterium-containing vacuole. however, the requirement of tfr <dig> for bacterial pathogenesis has not been directly addressed.

we sought here to determine if iron delivery through the transferrin receptor  is essential for the success of two intracellular pathogens with differing intracellular life-styles, salmonella typhimurium and francisella tularensis. salmonella typhimurium represents a well-characterized model intracellular pathogen, which causes typhoid fever in the mouse. salmonella uncouples from the phagolysosomal pathway in macrophages and remains in a protected intracellular niche inside a vacuole  <cit> . the salmonella-containing vacuole  interacts with multiple endocytic pathways and avoids its fusion with acidic lysosomes. this is similar to infection with chlamydia, legionella, and mycobacteriae. in contrast, francisella tularensis, causative agent of tularemia and considered a category a biothreat because of its high infectivity and high case-fatality rate when untreated, enters the macrophage in a vesicle, but escapes from its enclosure into the cytosol after lysis of its vesicle within sixty minutes after entry into the host cell  <cit> . both francisella and salmonella require iron for successful intracellular proliferation  <cit> . a francisella operon, figabcd, has recently been described as being involved in iron acquisition  <cit> . recent studies from two groups using random transposon mutagenesis of either f. tularensis lvs  <cit>  or f. novicida  <cit>  showed that insertions into the figa, figb, figc, or feob genes caused reduced virulence of these mutants. while transposon insertions may cause polar effects on downstream genes, these data strongly suggest that expression of these particular gene products is essential for full virulence of francisella species. in addition, expression of certain f.tularenis virulence genes is clearly regulated by iron availability  <cit> .

after exposure to just a few aerosolized francisella, serum iron decreases very rapidly  <cit> . bacteria counteract the host's withholding of iron by secretion of iron chelators, which are termed siderophores, or by directly interacting with host iron-binding proteins  <cit> . the francisella figabcdef gene cluster  encodes such a siderophore, which belongs to the polycarboxylate family such as produced by rhizopus species  <cit> .

all these studies suggest that a delicate balance of the iron available for bacteria and for host cell metabolism and defense strategies has to be achieved during infection. on the bacterial side, many operons responsible for iron acquisition and scavenging have been described. however, much less is known how the host cell modulates its iron homeostasis and how pathogens might actively influence such homeostasis.

RESULTS
transferrin receptor is required for francisella intracellular proliferation but not for salmonella
in order to determine if expression of tfr <dig> is required for proliferation of francisella and salmonella inside macrophages, sirna was used to silence the expression of tfr <dig> in murine macrophages . expression of the transferrin receptor was suppressed significantly  <dig> h after transfection with sirna as measured by fluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting . our transfection efficiency for sirna was 63% , which was determined by counting cells, which had taken up sirna labeled with the red fluorescence dye alexa fluor  <dig> . transfected cells appear to have an almost complete reduction of tfr <dig> . thus, the residual expression of transferrin receptors seen by immunoblot  is most likely due to non-transfected cells.

macrophages  transfected with tfr1-sirna were infected with francisella tularensis subspecies holarctica vaccine strain  or wild-type salmonella typhimurium . f. tularensis lvs has been developed from fully virulent type b francisella strains. it is attenuated in humans, but virulent in a mouse model  <cit> . after two hours of infection, there was no difference in the number of intracellular salmonella  or francisella  between non-transfected and transfected macrophages . this suggests that expression of tfr <dig> does not affect bacterial entry processes. francisella, however, failed to proliferate in macrophages in which expression of the transferrin receptor was suppressed . the amount of francisella recovered after  <dig> h most likely represents growth in macrophages which could not be transfected with sirna. in contrast, intracellular proliferation of s. typhimurium was not affected by the lack of tfr <dig> . addition of lactoferrin - chelated iron  as external iron source to macrophages with suppressed tfr <dig> rescued the proliferation of francisella at intermediate levels .

spatial relationship of transferrin receptor and francisella-containing vacuole
some intracellular pathogens have devised ways to attract transferrin receptors to the intracellular vesicles they reside in  <cit> . when salmonella enters macrophages, it localizes to an early endosome that is characterized by eea <dig> and recruitment of the transferrin receptor . as the salmonella-containing vacuole matures and acquires markers of late endosomes , it also loses tfr <dig>  <cit> .

francisella differs from salmonella by escaping early during infection from its endosomal environment. since little is known about tfr <dig> in macrophages infected with francisella, we investigated the role of the transferrin receptor during infection and its relation to the maturation of the francisella-containing vacuole . murine macrophages  were infected with francisella lvs that constitutively expressed gfp. at defined time intervals, infected cells were fixed and prepared for immunostaining. this demonstrated that early during entry , there is significant co-localization of fcv and tfr <dig> . as francisella is trafficking away from the cell membrane during the time course of the infection, the co-localization with tfr <dig> is lost .

early recycling endosomes are characterized by carrying tfr <dig>  eea <dig>  and rab <dig>  while excluding rab <dig> unless they are destined for further trafficking along the lysosomal degradation pathway  <cit> . macrophages infected with francisella were stained with antisera to rab <dig> and rab <dig>  this demonstrated that francisella very early on at the membrane recruits rab <dig> . colocalization of francisella and rab <dig> decreases over time as francisella escapes from the vacuole . however, there is no co-localization with rab7-containing vesicles .

these findings suggest that francisella enters through an early endosome, which is characterized by carrying tfr <dig> and rab <dig>  the francisella-containing vacuole does not mature further by acquiring rab <dig> and does not retain tfr <dig>  this is most likely due to exit from the vacuole  <cit>  rather than to trafficking to a different vesicle environment with concomitant loss of tfr <dig> 

infection of macrophages with francisella upregulates transferrin receptor
expression of tfr <dig> remains unchanged during infection with wild-type salmonella  <cit> . however, when expression of the transferrin receptor in uninfected macrophages was compared by microscopy to the expression in cells infected with francisella, it became evident that francisella-infected macrophages have a higher level of transferrin receptor expression . this was confirmed by comparing the expression level of the transferrin receptor in francisella-infected macrophages to the level found in uninfected cells by immunblotting at one hour and twenty-four hours after infection . we also tested the expression level of transferrin receptor in cells, which had taken up formalin-fixed francisella. this did not lead to a comparable upregulation of tfr <dig> . synthesis of the transferrin receptor is mainly regulated at the translational level as a response to the iron level or to other inputs. indeed, after two hours of infection there was no increase in the mrna level for tfr <dig> as determined by real-time rt-pcr . however, after  <dig> h of infection, the mrna level for tfr <dig> had more than doubled .

increased level of transferrin receptor in infected cells can increase the labile iron pool
an increased tfr <dig> expression could translate into enhanced transferrin-mediated delivery of iron into the host cell and increased iron availability for francisella. for francisella, this could be accomplished by transferrin directly binding to the bacterial cell surface via a transferrin-binding protein, as has been described for other, mostly extracellular bacteria  <cit> . search of the francisella genome did not reveal any homologue to transferrin-binding proteins . we could also experimentally verify that apo-transferrin and holotransferrin do not bind to francisella .

we therefore asked if the increased expression of tfr <dig> correlates with an increase of iron delivery to the host cell. in most cells, uptake of transferrin-bound iron leads to fast delivery into the cytosolic labile iron pool, which can be operationally defined as the cell chelatable pool that includes fe2+ and fe3+ associated with ligands such as organic anions, polypeptides, or surface membrane components  <cit> . the labile iron pool  composes the metabolically active and regulatory forms of iron . a sensitive way to measure the labile iron pool without cell disruption is the use of a membrane permeable fluorescent probe such as calcein. calcein rapidly forms a complex with iron in a 1: <dig> stoichiometry. this results in quenching of the green fluorescence of calcein. when cells are loaded so that there is a minor excess of free fluorescent calcein, an increase in the lip will result in a decrease of the fluorescence signal  <cit> , whereas the total cell-associated lip can be determined after dequenching of the fluorescence signal with a cell-permeant fe-chelator  <cit> .

macrophages were infected with francisella for two and twenty-four hours or left uninfected as control. after loading with calcein, cells were exposed to holotransferrin as delivery vehicle for iron while the fluorescence signal was measured. in macrophages infected with francisella, there is a rapid iron uptake as determined by the slope of the fluorescence quenching, which is steeper than in the control sample  . infected macrophages also appear to at least transiently increase the lip more than uninfected cells, as evidenced by the amplitude of fluorescence quenching . this observation is consistent with an increased number of tfrs on the cell surface, allowing an increased uptake at a faster rate of iron into the cell. the iron measured here is at least temporarily available as soluble iron and should thus be readily available for uptake by francisella. in contrast, when we measured the lip of macrophages whose tfr <dig> expression has been suppressed by sirna, we found a decreased lip  and a decreased rate of iron uptake .

labile iron pool during infection with francisella or salmonella
while increased expression of tfr <dig> leads to an increase in the labile iron pool when exposed to iron-loaded transferrin, the overall labile iron pool  of the host cell can be affected in many different ways during infection. we therefore assessed the lip during infection with francisella by using the calcein method as described earlier  <cit>  and compared it to the lip during infection with salmonella. after two hours of infection with francisella and salmonella there was a 10-25% increase in the labile iron pool . over the next twenty-two hours, macrophages infected with francisella maintained an increased iron pool , whereas those infected with salmonella showed a persistently decreasing iron pool .

we also measured changes in the labile iron pool during infection with two isogenic mutant salmonella strains, spia and spic, which have intracellular trafficking deficits associated with reduced intracellular proliferation and avirulence in mice. these strains carry two different deletions in the spi- <dig> type iii secretion system   <cit> . the rationale for using these strains in our experiments was to investigate if different subcellular localizations of a given pathogen can lead to different patterns in iron acquisition. after two hours of infection, the labile iron pool was increased similar to macrophages infected with wild-type salmonella . after twenty-four hours, spic salmonella gradually decreased the iron pool similar to infection with wild type . in contrast, the labile iron pool initially decreased and then remained unchanged during infection with spia salmonella .

iron-related gene expression in macrophages infected with salmonella or francisella
acquisition of iron through tfr <dig> requires expression of accessory gene products  and can be countered by increased iron export  or scavenging of iron by the lipocalin system . induction of innate immune responses during infection can modulate iron homeostasis pathways through induction of hepcidin  and lcn <dig>  the expression of such genes and selected other genes that are involved in the homeostasis of host cell iron levels were investigated by real-time rt-pcr during infection with francisella and compared to the expression profile of host cells during infection with salmonella.

there are two main eukaryotic iron-regulatory proteins, irp <dig> and irp <dig>  which sense changes in the labile iron pool and secondary signals associated with redox active species. they both act post-translationally by stabilizing their respective target mrna and by affecting initiation of translation. while expression of irp- <dig> is increased by salmonella and francisella , irp <dig> is strongly induced only in francisella-infected cells .

after uptake of iron via tfr <dig> and acidity-triggered release into the vesicle, ferric iron needs to be reduced, which is accomplished by the ferrireductase steap <dig>  <cit> . after reduction, ferrous iron is transported into the cytosol by dmt <dig> or functional nramp <dig>  <cit> . there is a fivefold higher induction of steap <dig> and dmt <dig> during infection with francisella  when compared to infection with wild-type salmonella  .

infected host cells can restrict the intracellular iron pool available for intracellular parasites by transporting iron out of the cells via ferroportin  <dig> , a transmembrane iron efflux protein  <cit> . while fpn <dig> is increased  <dig> -fold in macrophages infected with francisella , there is no change during infection with salmonella  .

during infection with bacteria, hepatocytes secrete the antimicrobial peptide hepcidin , which binds to ferroportin on macrophages . this leads to internalization and degradation of ferroportin and entrapment of iron inside the cell. it was also shown recently that hepcidin is induced in myeloid cells through the tlr- <dig> pathway and regulates ferroportin levels at the transcriptional and post-translational level  <cit> . hepcidin thus effectively reduces iron efflux  <cit> . there is a two-fold stronger induction of hepcidin during infection with salmonella when compared to infection with francisella . this might be explained by francisella lps preferentially stimulating the tlr- <dig> pathway, while salmonella lps induces the tlr- <dig> pathway  <cit> .

the lipocalin system provides the host with another way of scavenging iron or withholding it from bacteria  <cit> . the host protein lipocalin  can interact with bacterial siderophores and has now been recognized as an important arm of the innate immune response after its production is stimulated by recognition of bacteria through tlr- <dig> pathways  <cit> . lcn <dig> is induced twofold in cells infected with francisella , but more than 15-fold when cells are infected with salmonella . this might again be expected because of the strong induction of the tlr- <dig> pathway by salmonella in comparison to the preferred tlr- <dig> induction by francisella. salmonella, however, do not raise mrna levels for the lipocalin receptor , which are significantly increased in francisella-infected macrophages .

heme oxygenase  catalyzes the conversion of heme to biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide. in macrophages it has an important antioxidative protective function, presumably by reducing pro-oxidant or pro-apoptotic hemoproteins  <cit> . not unexpectedly, the mrna level for hmox <dig> is increased in macrophages infected by francisella and salmonella .

none of the components of the ferritin iron storage system are affected by infection with salmonella or francisella as measured by determining the expression of fth <dig> and ftl <dig> .

these gene-expression data suggest that francisella drives a more active transferrin-mediated iron uptake program than salmonella. increased mrna levels for irp <dig> and irp <dig> maintain increased translational levels for tfr <dig>  induction of genes required for transfer of iron to the cytosol via dmt <dig> and steap <dig> support the tfr1-mediated import route. preferential induction of the tlr- <dig> pathway by salmonella leads to a strong induction of hepcidin and lipocalin.

we further sought to characterize the expression profile of these iron-homoestasis-related genes in the spic and spia salmonella mutants, which lead to variable alterations in the lip . both mutant strains have a higher increase in the steap3/dmt <dig> genes than wild-type salmonella , while the induction of the iron-regulatory proteins irp <dig> and irp <dig> are lower . while tlr- <dig> driven induction of lipocalin is maintained in the mutant strains , there is no induction of hepcidin . the iron exporter fpn <dig> is increased threefold in the spic mutant , while there is no increase in the spia mutant  . this might be one possible explanation for the decrease in the labile iron pool in the spic mutant in comparison to the spia mutant . these findings suggest that distinct bacterial gene mutations with associated aberrant intracellular trafficking can affect the expression of iron homeostasis genes in the host cell.

discussion
we have characterized two different phenotypes of host cell and intracellular bacterial pathogen behavior in relation to host cell iron metabolism and bacterial iron requirements. francisella drives an active iron acquisition program through the transferrin receptor tfr <dig> with a sustained increase in the host cell labile iron pool. since francisella depends on expression of tfr <dig> for intracellular survival, it might need an increased host cell iron level for its own metabolism and might be able to efficiently counteract increased production of host cell reactive redox species. salmonella, on the other hand, does not require tfr <dig> for growth inside its host cell, lacks a strong induction of gene products aimed at facilitating iron import via tfr <dig>  and negotiates a decreased iron level in the host cell. this might be explained by salmonella's intracellular localization within an endosomal structure or perhaps by more efficient iron acquisition strategies. the distinction of these two phenotypes will allow further characterization and understanding of eukaryotic iron metabolism and its modulation by intracellular bacteria.

francisella enters macrophages inside an early endosome, from which it later escapes into the cell cytosol  <cit> . we have provided corroborating evidence that entry occurs in an early endosome with recruitment of tfr <dig> and rab <dig>  but no acquisition of rab <dig>  which is a prerequisite for further maturation in the phagolysosomal trafficking pathway. in this study we have demonstrated a very early co-localization of tfr <dig> and francisella at the cell surface. this suggests that tfr <dig> is recruited during the entry process rather than by successive fusion of francisella-containing vesicles with tfr1-carrying endosomes. such a process differs from m. tuberculosis-containing vesicles, which recruit tfr through endosome fusions during infection of the host cell  <cit> .

increased expression of the transferrin receptor has been shown previously during infection with ehrlichia, chlamydia, and coxiella, while reduced or unaltered expression was observed during infection with salmonella and legionella  <cit>  as a means of host defense by restricting the iron available for the invading pathogen. in fact, decreased expression of tfr <dig> in a patient due to a chronic inflammatory condition  proved non-permissive for infection with legionella  <cit> . infection with ehrlichia chafeensis and e. sennetsu changes the binding affinities for irp- <dig> during the first hours of infection with a concomitant increase in levels of transferrin receptor. this is followed by a response at the transcriptional level of transferrin receptor mrna at  <dig> h of infection  <cit> . similar to our observations with francisella, these effects require viable ehrlichia and cannot be caused by the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent. while francisella shows a very early and intense colocalization with tfr and then escapes from the vesicle, ehrlichia remains in a membranous compartment, which is characterized by rab <dig> and eea <dig> and only over time recruits tfr <dig>  <cit> . while our studies did not address the mechanisms by which francisella increases the expression of tfr <dig>  we speculate that a disruption of the host cell home iron homeostasis system causes the cell to sense a low iron balance with subsequent initiation of an active iron acquisition program. we cannot rule out that some bacterial product directly or indirectly through intermediates of inflammation affects irp- <dig> binding affinities or that other yet uncharacterized cytokine activation pathway triggered by the infection play a role.

while it is known that tfr <dig> transports fe-loaded transferrin to the bacterium-containing vesicle, it is not at all clear that iron delivered in this way can be utilized by bacteria. for m. tuberculosis it could be demonstrated that fe delivered by transferrin can be utilized  <cit> . based on the kinetics of fe delivery it was calculated, however, that at least a portion of the fe delivered by transferrin is first delivered to the cytosol, presumably through the action of dmt <dig>  <cit> . while siderophores clearly play a role, it could also be demonstrated that these exochelins cannot directly remove fe from transferrin  <cit> . it has also not been shown if such siderophores could actually transverse the endosome membrane. our data demonstrate that francisella actively upregulates tfr <dig>  which leads to an improved delivery of iron into the labile intracellular iron pool. in contrast to salmonella, francisella also drives an active iron acquisition program with upregulation of accessory iron metabolic genes such as the iron transporter dmt <dig> and the ferrireductase steap <dig>  which all serve to promote the import of iron from tfr <dig> to the cytosol. we propose that francisella can directly exploit the concomitant increase in lip during infection, whereas such an increase would be of little benefit to salmonella with a preferentially endosomal location.

a recent study has examined the expression profile of selected iron-homeiostasis genes and iron-loading of ferritin in murine macrophages during infection with salmonella  <cit> . while their findings agree with ours with regard to the upregulation of lcn <dig>  hmox <dig>  and hamp, the authors could not find a significant increase in dmt <dig>  but did see an increase in fpn <dig>  this correlated with their observation of increased iron efflux from infected cells and decreased iron content of ferritin. some of the differences between our data and theirs might be explained by their use of a particular salmonella strain . of particular interest in this context is that the spic salmonella mutant strain used in our studies behaves quite similiar to the c5rp <dig> strain by demonstrating an increase in fpn <dig> . it is thus conceivable that the salmonella strain employed by nairz and colleagues carries distinct uncharacterized gene mutations or phenotypes. our assessment of the labile iron pool after infection with salmonella after  <dig> h shows a decrease  and agrees with the findings reported by nairz  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
iron acquisition and utilization by microbes is of critical importance for bacterial pathogenesis. defects in the bacterium's ability to efficiently scavenge iron and use it in its metabolism usually lead to avirulence. however, little is known how bacteria might modulate the iron handling properties of their host cells.

we identified two distinct iron-handling scenarios for two different bacterial pathogens. francisella tularensis drives an active iron acquisition program via the tfr <dig> pathway program with induction of ferrireductase , iron membrane transporter dmt <dig>  and iron regulatory proteins irp <dig> and irp <dig>  which is associated with a sustained increase of the labile iron pool inside the macrophage. expression of tfr <dig> is critical for francisella's intracellular proliferation. this contrasts with infection of macrophages by wild-type salmonella typhimurium, which does not require expression of tfr <dig> for successful intracellular survival. macrophages infected with salmonella lack significant induction of dmt <dig>  steap <dig>  and irp <dig>  and maintain their labile iron pool at normal levels.
