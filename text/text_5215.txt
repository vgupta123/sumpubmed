BACKGROUND
the physiological importance of prosaposin has been demonstrated by the genetic deficiencies of individual saposins or prosaposin that lead to various glycosphingolipid  storage diseases  <cit> . saposin b deficiency leads to sulfatide accumulation and a metachromatic leukodystrophy-like disease  <cit>  that is similar to the deficiency of arylsulfatase a, its cognate enzyme. saposin c activates acid β-glucosidase and its deficiency leads to a gaucher-like disease with an excess accumulation of glucosylceramide in cells  <cit> . saposin a deficiency in mice results in a late onset, chronic form of globoid cell leukodystrophy  <cit> , whereas deficiency of saposin d in mice causes a loss of purkinje cells and urinary system defects  <cit> . the critical roles for saposins in gsl metabolism are highlighted by the extensive gsl storage in various central nervous system  regions in the human and mouse prosaposin deficiencies  <cit> . this deficiency leads to gross abnormalities in cns degradation of lactosylceramide , glucosylceramide , sulfatide and galactosylceramide with consequent pathologic accumulation of these gsls and gangliosides.

targeted disruption of prosaposin in the mouse leads to a complex neurodegeneration with neuronal and microglial accumulation of gsls, and demyelination  <cit> . the excesses of gsls lead to neuronal losses with regional specificity and death by ~ <dig> days  <cit> . our hypomorphic prosaposin model psko-tg  containing a prosaposin transgene has 45% of saposin protein expression in brain, survives up to  <dig> days and has delayed onset of neuropathological changes and purkinje cell loss compared to the null mouse  <cit> . another mutant mouse, 4l/ps-na, has the acid β-glucosidase v394l/v394l  point mutation combined with hypomorphic expression of the prosaposin transgene   <cit> . this mouse shows accumulation of gc in visceral organs and the cns in excess of that in either 4l  <cit>  or ps-na mice. similar to ps-na mice, 4l/ps-na mice develop a neurological phenotype and loss of purkinje cells. neuronal gsl storage and activated microglia/macrophage cells and astrocytes in cns are common pathologies in all three models.

here, the temporal course of the neuronal phenotypes was correlated with the molecular profile of disease progression in these prosaposin deficiency mouse models. microarray analyses revealed the common transcription factors that underlie prosaposin pathology and their relationship to development of the neurological phenotype. the results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms and the potential for strategic interventions for this class of diseases, as well as other acquired cns degenerative disorders that involve gsl.

RESULTS
description of prosaposin deficient mouse models
three mouse models with prosaposin deficiencies are included in this study . prosaposin knock out mice  live about  <dig> days and have progressive accumulation of laccer, gc, ceramide and total ganglioside sialic acid in the cns  <cit> . neuronal gsl storage is evident in ps-/- newborn brains  <cit> . ps-/- mice show the onset of neurological signs at ~ <dig> days of age and the phenotype rapidly progresses during the next 5– <dig> days. ps-na mice have ~45% of normal levels of prosaposin protein expression in the brain and lesser levels in other tissues  <cit> . they survive up to  <dig> wks with slow progression of neurological deficits. laccer and gc are the predominant excess neutral gsls in the ps-na brains. ps-na mice produced normal size litters and this model was subjected to neurological and behavioral testing. 4l/ps-na mice are homozygous for a gba mutant gene encoding a v394l gcase against the ps-na background  <cit> . the phenotype includes an average life span ~ <dig> wks, progressive neurological deficits, and greater excesses of gc accumulation in brain and visceral tissues than those in ps-na mice. ps-/- mice did not reproduce and 4l/ps-na had reduced fertility. ps-na and ps-/- mice were in the fvb strain background. 4l/ps-na mice were in a mix strain background . wt mice in the fvb background were used as controls in this study.

impairment of neurological function
deterioration of neurological function was formally assessed in the ps-na mice. the narrow bridges test was performed to evaluate balance and motor performance . different levels of task difficulty were assessed with round- and square-shaped beams with varying cross-sectional areas. at  <dig> wks, control and ps-na mice walked along the beam with similar latencies . however, ps-na mice made significantly more foot slips than controls on medium and narrow beams . at  <dig> wks, ps-na mice were already significantly slower in traversing the narrowest round and square beams, and the number of foot slips increased on medium and small square beams. between  <dig> to  <dig> wks, ps-na mice showed increased difficulty in traversing all beams, as measured by their increased latency and foot slips compared with control mice . at  <dig> wks or younger, both control and ps-na mice walked on the beam with an upright posture, but by  <dig> wks of age, ps-na mice displayed ventral recumbence; their abdomen was flattened on the surface of the beam, their hind- and fore-limbs were wrapped around the beam, and the fore-limbs were used to drag themselves along the beams. by  <dig> wks, some mutant mice failed to maintain balance and started to fall, but used their forelimbs to regain balance. ps-na mice exhibited progressive deterioration in performance on the narrow bridges test until  <dig> wks.

locomotor activity is a test of general exploration and response to novelty. ps-na and wt control mice took >  <dig> min for adaptation. ps-na mice showed measurable motor differences starting at  <dig> wks and the effect was more pronounced by  <dig> wks. they demonstrated hyperactivity with increases of beam breaks , and were active longer than controls. no difference between center and peripheral activity was observed. these results suggest that the deficiency of prosaposin results in a progressive failure to habituate in ps-na mice, compared to wt mice that showed habituation over the test period. the altered motor function was significant beginning at  <dig> wks.

gait was analyzed by footprint patterns while the mice walked through a runway. between control and ps-na mice, no significant differences were found before  <dig> wks for stride length or fore- and hind-paw overlap. by  <dig> wks, ps-na mice exhibited significantly increased hind-paw base width from the controls .

brain neuropathology in prosaposin deficient mice
by em, no inclusions were observed at  <dig> wks in ps-na or wt mouse brains. inclusion bodies were present in neurons of ps-na mice by  <dig> wks . such inclusions were observed in brain stem, midbrain and cerebral cortex, but rarely in purkinje cells. 4l/ps-na mice had neuronal storage similar to that in ps-na brains. however, 4l/ps-na mice showed large amounts of storage in granular cells of the cerebellum; this is not observed in ps-na mice  <cit> . ps-/- mice show inclusions in neurons of various regions in the brain  <cit> .

extensive neuronal degeneration was found in all the prosaposin deficient mouse brains. the specific neuronal stain, neun, was decreased in the cerebral cortex at  <dig> and  <dig> wks in ps-na mice. losses of cerebellar purkinje cells were demonstrated with anti-calbindin d28k, a purkinje cell marker, beginning at  <dig> wks . neuronal degeneration and decreases in purkinje cell numbers were also observed in 4l/ps-na mice. ps-/- mice showed neuronal degeneration in thalamus and cortex starting at ~ <dig> days; no purkinje cell loss was observed .

microarray analyses of brain tissues in prosaposin deficient mice
to explore the genes involved in the prosaposin deficiency disease progression pathway, mrna microarray analyses were performed in ps-na mice using mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  array chips . partek® genomics suite was used for statistical analyses of the microarray data. the commonalities and specificities of gene expression were analyzed in ps-/-, ps-na, and 4l/ps-na mice. ps-/- mice  quickly develop the neurological phenotype and have a short life span  <cit> . 4l/ps-na mice have the same level of prosaposin expression as ps-na mice, but the mice have a shorter lifespan, and also have greater gc accumulation   <cit> . the gene profiles were analyzed in two general brain regions, cerebrum and cerebellum, that were collected at several time points for ps-/- , ps-na  and 4l/ps-na . the probe sets for each gene in the mutant mice that showed significant differential gene expression were compared to the age-matched wt . the significantly differentially expressed probe sets in the mutant models ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> of the  <dig>  total probes on the chip. for further analyses, the probe sets were replaced by the genes. ests and genes of unknown function were excluded. at a false positive rate  of  <dig> , the total differentially expressed genes in each model ranged from  <dig> – <dig> % of the total genes on the chip. the complete lists of differentially expressed genes, grouped for their functions, are in additional file  <dig> 

compared to wt mice, the total number of significantly differentially expressed genes in each model was in the following order: 4l/ps-na > ps-na > ps-/- . in ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice, the number of differentially expressed genes was greater in cerebellum than in cerebrum. ps-/- mice had about equal numbers of differentially expressed genes in both tissues and ~20% were in common between the cerebrum and cerebellum. temporal profiling revealed that the number of the differentially expressed genes increased with age in all three models . the differentially expressed genes were sub-grouped into those up-regulated  or down-regulated  for any time point for each tissue . the number of up-regulated genes was nearly constant at the second time point , and then increased by the third time point . the number of down-regulated genes was relatively constant throughout. even at birth, ~100– <dig> genes in cerebellum or cerebrum had differential expression in ps-na and ps-/- mice ; 4l/ps-na mice were not done. although the ps-na and ps-/- mice did not develop neurological signs until after  <dig> wks and  <dig> days, respectively , the alterations of mrna expression preceded the neuronal deficits. these data suggest that the number of genes involved in pathological progression increased with age and varied with the genotype and lifespan, and the molecular alterations preceded the histological and neurological changes.

ontological analyses of the differentially regulated genes revealed involvement in a broad spectrum of cellular functions. the functional groups with statistical significance across the cerebrum and cerebellum in the three animal models included neuronal conduction , cell growth and metabolism, proinflammatory response , cell death, and signal transduction . all three mouse models showed similar spectra of gene expression patterns for these functional groups, except cerebra of ps-na and 4l/ps-na or cerebrum of ps-na which did not show significant  involvement of synaptic or myelination genes, respectively. several of these categories presented consistent increases of up-regulated genes with age, particularly those in the groups for inflammation and adhesion, cell death, signal transduction, transcription factors and transport . the total numbers of genes in these groups increased with age. more than twice as many genes were up-regulated in cerebellum than cerebrum. it is likely that additional dysregulated genes will be identified as sub-regions of cerebrum are analyzed. 4l/ps-na mice had twice as many up-regulated genes as the ps-na mice in cerebellum or cerebrum. this was primarily associated with more rapidly progressive neurological signs in the 4l/ps-na mice. the mixed strains in 4l/ps-na might also contribute to the larger numbers of differentially expressed genes, but the complexity of the genotype  and low number of offspring precluded exact matching of the background strains.

the functional categories with p-value ≤  <dig>  were considered significant by hypergeometric distribution analyses using r  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

*, not significant .

all three models had altered expression of many cell death associated genes . the classification of down-regulated genes  revealed a relatively constant number with age, implying their direct relationship to prosaposin gene deficiency. in the myelination category, ps-/- mice had more down-regulated genes than ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice. transcription, transport and signal transduction had larger number of altered genes in ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice. these results reflect differential tissue and cellular responses to prosaposin deficiency and gsl accumulation with age.

to identify the transcription factors likely involved in disease progression, the commonalities of expression in these three models were analyzed . as might be expected, the ps-na gene expression patterns were similar to those found in 4l/ps-na mice and these two were, in turn, more similar than either alone to those from ps-/- mice. cebpd was the only transcription factor up-regulated in cerebra and cerebella of all three models; this was observed by  <dig> days in ps-/- mice, and by  <dig> wks in ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice. cebpd is a member of ccaat/enhancer-binding protein family. the expression of cebpd is found in brain throughout development and into adulthood  <cit> . the age-dependent expression of cebpd suggests its participation in the propagation and/or initiation of disease processes in prosaposin deficient mice. two other transcription factors , atf <dig> and nfia, were differentially expressed in ps-na and 4l/ps-na cerebella and cerebra. atf <dig>  is a member of creb family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors whose expression begins after birth. in the cerebella of ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice, increases of atf <dig> expression started at  <dig> wks and in cerebra at  <dig> and  <dig> wks. atf <dig> expression was not altered in ps-/- mice during their  <dig> wk lifespan. the down-regulated transcription factor nfia  is a member of ccaat box binding transcription factor family. nfia is expressed early in embryonic development to adulthood, and is involved in development of multiple organs, including the hippocampus  <cit>  and cerebellar granular cells  <cit> . the levels of nfia were consistently low in cerebrum and cerebellum of ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice, but were not altered in ps-/- mice. atf <dig> and nfia could be potential candidates that regulate disease progression in prosaposin deficiency at later ages.

the down-regulated genes were analyzed by k-means clustering for similarities in expression profiles throughout development . the myelination-associated genes with similar expression profiles showed decreased expression levels in cerebellum and cerebrum of ps-/- mice by  <dig> days compared to wt . these genes were not significantly altered in ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice. this result is consistent with findings that hypomyelination is a major component of the phenotype in ps-/- mice, but not of ps-na mice  <cit> . ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice showed losses of cerebellar purkinje cells . down-regulation of calb <dig>  and pcp <dig>  was detected by  <dig> wks in cerebella from ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice . grid  <dig> is a delta  <dig> glutamate receptor that controls synaptic plasticity in purkinje cells  <cit> . decreases of grid  <dig> were found in the cerebellum from 4l/ps-na mice suggesting the loss of purkinje cells was related to synaptic arborization. overall, ps-na mice had fewer down-regulated genes than 4l/ps-na mice ; this was likely associated with the more rapid development of neurological signs in 4l/ps-na mice than in ps-na mice, as well as the degree of gc accumulation. in cerebrum, three down-regulated genes were shared in the ps-na and 4l/ps-na brains. creg <dig>  a cellular repressor of the e1a-stimulated gene, is specifically expressed in hippocampus and is involved in cellular differentiation  <cit> . kcnn <dig>  modulates aspects of hippocampal learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity  <cit>  and is expressed only in the brain. clasp <dig>  binds to microtubule ends and is involved in cytoskeletal organization  <cit> . down-regulation of kcnn <dig>  creg <dig> and clasp <dig> suggests defects in cellular differentiation and synaptic activity in ps-na and 4l/ps-na mouse brains.

with the disease progression, increasing numbers of proinflammatory associated genes  showed increased mrna levels in brains of all three models  and included the macrophage expressed genes: csf, ccl <dig>  cd <dig>  c1q, lgals <dig>  gfap level increases indicated astrogliosis in the ps deficiency diseases . the expression levels of proinflammatory associated genes were up-regulated by  <dig> wks and before neurological impairment. several extracellular matrix and proteolytic enzymes  and lysosomal proteases  involved in the proinflammatory response also had increased expression levels. the cell death genes, pycard and bcl2a1a, had elevated expression in cerebella and cerebra from all three models. pycard and bcl2a1a are apoptotic protease activator and anti apoptosis molecules, respectively  <cit> . casp <dig> was up-regulated in the cerebellum from ps-na mice, but not that from ps-/- mice , suggesting tissue and age-dependent activation patterns. in addition, some of the genes involved postsynaptic activity  and proteasome subunit proteins  and ubiquitin associated enzymes ) were significantly up-regulated in the ps-na, 4l/ps-na and ps-/- models , implicating altered synaptic activity and ubiquitin proteasome metabolism in prosaposin deficient mice secondary to gsl accumulation in brain.

validation of microarray data
to validate the expression changes identified in the array analyses, selected genes were examined in more detail by qrt-pcr. the alterations of gene expression for cebpd, atf <dig>  creg <dig>  clasp <dig>  grid  <dig> and bcl2a1a directly corresponded with the specific microarray data, e.g. increases of mrna for cebpd, atf <dig> and bcl2a1a, and decreases for greg <dig> mrna were found in the adult samples . by immunofluorescence analyses, gfap signals in  <dig> wk ps-na brain was at wt levels. in comparison, the gfap signals in astrocytes of  <dig> and  <dig> wk ps-na mice were greater. in addition, gfap-positive astrocytes in ps-na mice were increased in number and were ramified across brain regions compared to control samples . such astrogliosis is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. a few cd <dig>  positive cells were present in  <dig> wk ps-na brain. in  <dig> and  <dig> wk ps-na mice, cd <dig> stained microglia/macrophages in all regions of the brain, but with increased intensities. some of these cd68-positive cells had increased size. caspase  <dig> showed elevated expression in purkinje cells of the cerebellum in  <dig> and  <dig> wk brains. gfap and cd68-positive staining were also observed  in ps-/- and 4l/ps-na mice . these results were consistent with the microarray analyses  and demonstrated that astrocytes and microglia were activated in these models and involved in the proinflammatory response in an age-dependent manner.

cebpd associated pathway
the differentially expressed genes in the three models were subjected to network-based analyses to explore cebpd gene interactions. about  <dig> genes were classified into a cebpd- associated common pathway from all differentially expressed genes in three models. cebpd had direct interactions with gfap, mbp, igfbp <dig>  atf <dig>  hmox <dig>  cebpa, cebpb and fos. those genes in turn connected with those in multiple functional groups: transcription , proinflammation , cell death , binding , myelin  and transport  . the temporal expression pattern  in the cerebellum from each model showed that up-regulated genes in the cebpd network increased and down-regulated genes were constant with time. the pathway does not reflect cellular specificity, but it provides a temporal view of dynamic changes for each functional group in the disease course.

discussion
deficiency of prosaposin/saposins results in incomplete catabolism of gsls and their age dependent accumulation in the brain  <cit> . to understand the molecular changes at the transcriptome level during the disease course of prosaposin deficiency, three mouse models were compared in this study by microarray analysis: 1) a complete deficiency , 2) a hypomorph , and 3) a hypomorph together with a gcase mutation . in these three chronic neurological disease models, significant numbers of genes were up- or down-regulated at birth prior to any behavioral, histological or significant gsl abnormalities. the differentially expressed genes included those involved in transcription and signal transduction that were early molecular responses to the insult from incomplete gsl degradation. with age, gsl  accumulation became detectible and the surrounding astrocytes and microglial cells sensed the insult and promoted proinflammatory responses to maintain tissues homeostasis. the alterations of proinflammatory genes were common in all three models, which reflect the generalized distribution of microglial cells and astrocytes in the brain. prolonged proinflammatory reactions also are present in other neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> ; they can promote beneficial effects, i.e., repair, as well as detrimental or destructive effects in the brain. the loss of irreplaceable neurons in ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice started at ~ <dig> wks. the negative tunel assays  <cit>  indicated an alternative cell death pathway, e.g., necrosis or autophagy, in these mouse brains. importantly, neurobehavioral impairments in ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice preceded detectible neuronal cell loss, suggesting that the functional impairments preceded the structural deficits, and that the accumulating  gsl had direct effects on overall cell regulation. the basis for the underlying neurological deficits might be attributed to synaptic dysfunction as has been found in ataxia and alzheimer's disease  <cit> . alteration of synaptic and proteosome genes in the current models implicates gsl storage in the lysosome as affecting synaptic function and leading to dendritic retraction and neuronal death. as a potential link to this pathogenic mechanism, ubiquitin proteases that are linked to synaptic activity  <cit>  were altered in these models. differential expression of the ubiquitin protease genes was identified in ps-/-, ps-na and 4l/ps-na mouse brains and accumulation of ubiquitin was found in the brains of all three mouse models . clarification is needed for the interaction between ubiquitin-dependent protein turnover, and the plastic and degenerative changes at synapses in brains with gsl accumulation.

among the differentially expressed genes, cebpd was the only transcription factor up-regulated in the cerebella and cerebra of all three mouse models. this unique commonality was not obscured by the potential diluting effect from the combined analyses of sub-regions of cerebrum or genetic background variation between 4l/ps-na  and ps-/-, ps-na and wt . network analysis indicated that cebpd directly or indirectly connects to gene functional effector pathways. for example, cebpd modulates gfap and expression of numerous cytokines through fos mediated proinflammatory pathways . cebpd also modulates mbp and fos expression. mbp interacted with myelin-associated genes and both mbp and fos connected into the cell death pathways. cebpd has been previously implicated in peripheral immune challenge  <cit>  and cebpd is up-regulated after traumatic brain injury in rats and in brains from patients with alzheimer's disease  <cit> . lipopolysaccharide  and galactosylsphingosine are exogenous ligands that regulate cebpd expression in visceral tissues and astrocytes  <cit> . in response to lps treatment, cebpd and nf-kb are recruited to the cns  <cit> . galactosylsphingosine, a cytotoxic metabolite of galactosyl ceramide found in krabbe disease, induces expression of cytokine mediated nuclear translocation of cebpd  <cit> . the present data suggest that accumulated gsls in prosaposin deficient brains might be endogenous lipids that mediate cebpd expression. furthermore, cebpd binds to cytokine promoters in macrophages and astrocytes  <cit> . the expression of cebpd is mediated by sp <dig>  stat <dig>  c-rel and c-jun  <cit> , whereas the downstream genes mbp and gfap, as well as several inflammatory genes, are modulated by cebpd in astrocytes  <cit> .

cebpd is widely expressed in the pns and cns. cebpd in combination with creb  participates in nerve growth factor gene transcription  <cit> . curiously, the cebpd knockout mice have no major phenotypes except enhanced contextual fear, whereas, cebpa and cebpb knockouts exhibit perinatal lethality or rapid deterioration within months after birth  <cit> . such findings suggest that cebpd is not essential in non-stressed physiological development, but may be important in response to pathological insults by playing a role in the modulation of proinflammatory responses and neuronal homeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases. cebpd expression was up-regulated after  <dig> days in ps-/- mice and after  <dig> wks in ps-na and 4l/ps-na mice. the temporal change of this expression correlated directly with the biochemical and histological progression of the disease. apparently, cebpd plays a role in the cns of prosaposin deficiency mice in promoting disease progression.

atf <dig> has been suggested as an "adaptive response" gene by responding to extra- and intra-cellular changes induced by stress signals and signals for promoting cell proliferation  <cit> . atf <dig> is induced by lps and is a negative regulator of tlr  <dig> and ccl <dig> released from macrophages  <cit> . atf <dig> has been suggested as having a role in controlling gene expression programs required for axon regeneration  <cit> . the increase of atf <dig> might be involved in an adaptive response to the disease in the present models. nfia promotes gliogenesis in spinal cord  <cit>  and directs the differentiation of cerebellar granular neurons  <cit> . disruption of nfia in mice leads to perinatal lethality, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and abnormal formation of midline glial structures  <cit> . both atf <dig> and nfia were present in the cebpd network, suggesting potential interactions effects between these transcription factors.

gene expression profiles have been studied in several lysosomal diseases. by serial analysis of gene expression , many up-regulated genes are attributed to the proinflammation pathways in the gm <dig> gangliosidoses, tay-sachs and sandhoff disease patients' brains  <cit> . in the severe neuronopathic gaucher disease type  <dig>  with increased gc, the genes in brain associated with microglial cells and astrocytes are slightly elevated and the neuronal genes has small depressions  <cit> . using a cdna microarray, human niemann-pick c <dig> fibroblasts revealed oxidative stress, impairment of trafficking and regulation of calcium in response to abnormal cholesterol and gsl accumulation  <cit> . this is quite different from that obtained in our prosaposin deficient mice. the transcription profiles demonstrated that molecular changes involved proinflammation, trafficking, and loss of neuron cells. these results suggest a gsl and cellular specificity in response to the disease. interestingly, several lysosomal enzymes showed up-regulation  in the present models, suggesting altered lysosomal function compensating for gsl storage.

CONCLUSIONS
the microarray analyses in this study begin to dissect the complex interactions that underlie gsl disease progression. regionally-specific gene expression abnormalities preceded the histological and neuronal phenotype changes. the proinflammatory response of microglial cells and astrocytes likely propagated the disease and played an important role in neurodegeneration. cebpd is apparently a candidate regulator participated in disease progression in prosaposin deficiency. these results provide insight into the molecular mechanism in the progression of gsl disease and therapeutic potential for the acquired cns degenerative disorders that involve gsl.
