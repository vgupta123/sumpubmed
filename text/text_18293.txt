BACKGROUND
histone deacetylases  have been generally responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on the n-terminal region of core histones. this usually gives a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events. they are classified into three different families namely the rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily, sirtuin family, and the hd <dig> family  <cit> . members of rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily and sirtuin family are proteins homologous to the yeast reduced potassium dependency  <dig> /hda <dig> and silent information regulator  <dig> , respectively, whereas hd <dig> family is unique in plants. phylogenetic studies classify the rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily  histone deacetylases into three classes: the class  <dig> , class  <dig> , and an additional class defined by the human hshda <dig>   <cit> . this third class has been named class  <dig> to distinguish it from the unrelated nad-dependent sirtuin deacetylases, which have sometimes been called class  <dig> hdacs.

among the rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily histone deacetylases in arabidopsis, athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig> have been demonstrated to play essential roles in plant development and environmental stress response  <cit> . aside from regulating rrna genes and affecting transgene expression and dna methylation, athda <dig> is also known as a global repressor involved in ja pathway, senescence, flowering, repression of embryonic properties, and establishment of nucleolar dominance  <cit> . similarly, athda <dig> is a global repressor in embryonic and flower development, ja and ethylene signaling, and regulates plant basal response via interaction with wrky transcription factors  <cit> . studies by xu et al.  <cit>  suggested the involvement of hda <dig> in root epidermal patterning.

to date, there are  <dig> histone deacetylases known in arabidopsis with the rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily subdivided into three classes  <cit> . four proteins were reported to be under class i namely athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig> while three have been shown to be classified under class ii, namely athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig>  on the other hand, athda <dig> was the sole plant histone deacetylase under the class iii group with no other identified plant homologue  <cit> . still, there are those that remain unclassified but are grouped within the rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily such as athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig>  <cit> . on another study conducted by fu et al.  <cit> , results on the phylogenetic analysis of the rpd3/hda <dig> histone deacetylases on oryza sativa suggested this group to be divided into four classes. due to the limited number of studies and incongruent results using different plant samples, there remains to be no clear basis for the classification of histone deacetylases under the rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily, particularly on plants.

this study aims to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree to determine evolutionary relationships between rpd3/hda <dig> histone deacetylases from six different plants representing dicots with arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa, and pinus taeda, monocots with oryza sativa and zea mays, and the lower plants with the moss, physcomitrella patens. phylogenetic analyses of these  <dig> genes predicted to be members of the rpd3/hda <dig> family showed that this superfamily constitute  <dig> distinct phylogenetic groups classified as class i, class ii, and class iv identifying corresponding orthologues in all the six plant species studied. athda <dig> was classified as class iv based on phylogenetic analyses and sequence similarity to its mammalian orthologue, hshda <dig>  and to distinguish it from sirtuin deacetylases.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analyses of rpd3/hda <dig> histone deacetylases in arabidopsis, yeast, and metazoans
prospective members of rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily from six yeast and metazoan species  including arabidopsis were phylogenetically analyzed to determine evolutionary relationships and sequence homology . based on the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from  <dig> replicates, histone deacetylases similar to the yeast rpd <dig> classified as class i includes schda <dig>  schda <dig>  schda <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae; cahda <dig>  cahda <dig>  cahda <dig>  and cahda <dig> in candida albicans; cehda <dig>  cehda <dig>  and cehda <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans; dmhda <dig> and dmhda <dig> in drosophila melanogaster; hshda <dig>  hshda <dig>  hshda <dig>  and hshda <dig> in homo sapiens; athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana. on the other hand, class ii histone deacetylases manifesting high sequence similarity to the yeast hda <dig> includes the following: schda <dig> and schda <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae; cahda <dig> and cahda <dig> in candida albicans; cehda <dig>  cehda <dig>  cehda <dig>  and cehda <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans; dmhda <dig> and dmhda <dig> in drosophila melanogaster; hshda <dig>  hshda <dig>  hshda <dig>  hshda <dig>  hshda <dig>  and hshda <dig> in homo sapiens; while in arabidopsis thaliana, athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  including athda <dig> with 78% bootstrap support and athda <dig> with 93% bootstraps all belong to the class ii group. another cluster grouped as class iv is only represented by the metazoans namely, cehda <dig>  dmhda <dig>  hshda <dig>  and athda <dig>  the emergence of the class iv group from the metazoans may reflect evolutionary divergence paving the way for functional specialization in multicellular metabolic processes.

*alias and other names referred to the following histone deacetylases are written in parenthesis under its formal name assigned by chromatin database .

phylogenetic analyses of rpd3/hda <dig> histone deacetylases in plants
to analyze further the classification of rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily in plants, amino acid sequences from  <dig> rpd3/hda <dig> proteins  were used to derive sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses. the overall phylogenetic tree inferred to represent all the  <dig> prospective rpd3/hda <dig> proteins had a good bootstrap support indicating that the derived tree truly reflects the data used to generate it. as shown in figure  <dig>  a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree of rpd3/hda <dig> histone deacetylases from arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa, pinus taeda, oryza sativa, zea mays, and physcomitrella patens shows the evolutionary relationships between these  <dig> proteins. as depicted in figure  <dig>  a radiation neighbor joining phylogenetic tree of rpd3/hda <dig> histone deacetylases in the six plant species analyzed exhibited  <dig> different clades isolating the athda <dig> group from the other groups. thus, each clade can be classified as class i for the rpd <dig> group, class ii for the hda1-like group, and class iv for the athda <dig> group. all the rpd3/hda <dig> proteins in arabidopsis were distributed accordingly to their proposed class identifying further orthologues from other dicots, monocots, and in the lower plant moss.

* rpd3/hda <dig> family histone deacetylases from oryza sativa japonicum were referenced from fu et al  where oshda <dig>  oshda <dig>  and oshda <dig> were included in the analyses in addition to the hdas from oryza sativa indica.

moreover, class ii seems to manifest three different clusters separating the athda <dig> group, athda <dig> group, and the originally identified class ii genes, athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig>  <cit> . in previous studies, athda <dig> and athda <dig> were considered unclassified proteins because they failed to cluster within the other hdas even if they share the same conserved amino acid positions for class ii proteins. in addition, there were no known closely related proteins to compare with these hdas to establish its classification as a class ii histone deacetylase  <cit> . fortunately, we have identified representative monocot, other dicots, and a lower plant moss orthologues for all the class ii genes including athda <dig> and athda <dig> with high bootstrap support.

class i: the rpd3-like group
for the rpd <dig> group, it appears that arabidopsis athda <dig> and athda <dig> are orthologues of the pine pthda <dig> with a high bootstrap support of 93%. although athda <dig> and athda <dig> are considered in-paralogues, its emergence after the species split technically makes it a bona fide orthologue  <cit> . however, the divergence of this group from the majority of class i may be due to its short sequences but have high sequence similarity mainly in the rpd <dig> hda domain exhibiting 93% bootstraps. moving further, athda <dig> of arabidopsis was found to be similar with the poplar pthda <dig> but with a mediocre bootstrap of 51%. its monocot counterparts oshda <dig> and zmhda <dig> manifested a perfect bootstrap of 100%. its lower plant orthologue pphda <dig> from physcomitrella diverged early on from its higher plant homologues exhibiting a 64% bootstrap. the poplar pthda <dig> and pthda <dig> appear to be orthologues of arabidopsis athda <dig>  which is highly similar still to athda <dig> . with a 99% bootstraps as quantifier for its robustness, this dicot group found its monocot counterparts in oshda <dig> and zmhda <dig> which were highly similar demonstrating 100% bootstrap support. on the other hand, athda <dig> or athda <dig> from arabidopsis is orthologous to poplar pthda <dig> and pthda <dig> with 93% bootstraps. however, its immediate sister group in physcomitrella pphda <dig> and pphda <dig>  showed low bootstrap support  indicating that they may have the same ancestral roots but are unlikely to be the closest link. this gene group appears to be anomalous since physcomitrella is expected to be the most ancestral which should have diverged first before any higher plant species split. it is quite strange to note that its monocot counterparts diverged twice earlier on during its evolutionary process. the more recent deviation lead to the speciation of rice oshda <dig> and maize zmhda <dig>  and another monocot sister group zmhda <dig> and zmhda <dig> . unfortunately, this two monocot sister groups have a low bootstrap support  with which only one of this group can truly represent the closest monocot orthologues of athda <dig>  the earliest divergence, however, can be traced back to its rice orthologues coupled with gene duplications yielding oshda <dig> and oshda <dig> .

class ii: hda1-like group
based on phylogenetic analyses as reflected on the consensus trees in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  the class ii group is composed of three clusters wherein each cluster contains monocot, eu-dicot, and lower plant moss representatives. the first cluster is represented by the athda <dig> group which diverged the earliest from the class ii group . the lower plant pphda <dig> split earlier from the line  followed by the monocot/eu-dicot split with a mediocre 67% bootstraps. athda <dig> from arabidopsis appears to be orthologous to poplar pthda <dig> with 78% bootstraps. its monocot sister group comprises zmhda <dig> from maize and oshda <dig> and oshda <dig> from rice  showing a perfect 100% bootstraps. the emergence of the second cluster made up of homologues of athda <dig> seems to take a different evolutionary route from the classic lower plant/higher plant first followed by monocot/dicot split events. the poplar pthda <dig> diverged early from the line  followed by the divergence of the lower plant pphda <dig> and the rest of higher plant group  separating further the dicots from the monocots . the dicot group was composed of arabidopsis athda <dig> which appears to be an orthologue of the poplar . its monocot counterpart was basically comprised of the maize zmhda <dig> and oryza sativa which underwent further speciation producing  <dig> orthologues from rice, oshda <dig> and oshda <dig>  both with 100% bootstrap support.

the third cluster is composed of the originally identified class ii genes, athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig> . both athda <dig> and athda <dig> belong to the same group since athda <dig> is basically a product of gene duplication of athda <dig>  from the dicot group, only pphda <dig> shows high sequence similarity to athda <dig> . from its monocot counterpart, the maize zmhda <dig> diverged earlier prior to the separation of another maize, zmhda <dig>  leading to the rice speciation of oshda <dig> and oshda <dig>  indica and japonica, respectively, with 100% bootstraps. moreover, the lower plant moss hda <dig>  diverged from the main line followed by the lower plant moss hda <dig> and hda <dig> which shows high sequence similarity . this was followed by a dicot-monocot split  with the dicot represented by the poplar pthda <dig> which is an orthologue of arabidopsis athda <dig> . the monocot group, on the other hand, is represented by maize zmhda <dig> and rice which underwent further speciation in oshda <dig> and oshda <dig>  indica and japonica, respectively, both reflecting 100% bootstraps.

class iv: hda <dig> group
class iv group is represented accordingly by all the six plant species studied with physcomitrella pphda <dig> and pphda <dig>  diverging early on from the higher plants reflecting a high 94% bootstraps. the monocot group deviated from the eu-dicot group  with rice oshda <dig> and maize zmhda <dig> as the monocot orthologues. the eu-dicot group, however, underwent further speciation separating the gymnosperm pihda <dig> from the angiosperms athda <dig> and pthda <dig> , from arabidopsis and poplar, respectively.

conserved domains
different databases such as pfam  <cit> , interpro  <cit> , automatic domain decomposition algorithm  <cit> , and uniprotkb/trembl  <cit>  were used to determine the conserved domains of these histone deacetylases . based on the sequence analysis from pfam database, a new conserved domain was detected in athda <dig>  a bh3-only pro-apoptotic domain  from the bcl- <dig> protein family is encoded at amino acids 385– <dig>  this protein family is highly regulated by phosphorylation in response to survival factors  <cit>  not to mention phosphorylation-regulated 14-3- <dig> binding with bad proteins  <cit> . although athda <dig> and athda <dig> are classified under the rpd <dig> group due to sequence similarity with their histone deacetylase domain, they do not contain any active sites.

on the other hand, class ii hdas manifest variable conserved domains. athda <dig> contains the histone deacetylase conserved region at amino acids 46– <dig> with a histidine active site located at amino acid  <dig>  two other conserved regions were identified by pfam-b at amino acids 383– <dig>  and 438– <dig> . as retrieved from the automatic domain decomposition algorithm  database, pfam-b  <dig> corresponds to a phosphate abc transporter which is a substrate binding component. on the other hand, pfam-b  <dig> corresponds to a conserved  <dig> amino acid, hypothetical protein found in pyrococcus horikoshii. both pfam-b regions were also found in its monocot orthologues in maize mzhda <dig> and rice oshda <dig> and oshda <dig>  the poplar orthologue, pthda <dig>  on the other hand, also contains the pfam-b  <dig> region together with a conserved sedlin n and transposase  <dig> domain. sedlin n functions in endoplasmic reticulum-to-golgi transport while transposase  <dig> are necessary for efficient dna transposition.

athda <dig> contains a histidine active site at amino acid  <dig> in the histone deacetylase domain . the conserved histone deacetylase region in athda <dig> was estimated at amino acids 80– <dig> with an active site at  <dig> . in addition, athda <dig> also contains a predicted integral membrane protein duf <dig> which is found in various hypothetical bacterial proteins and in rna polymerase sigma factor. however, its relevant function in athda <dig> remains to be elucidated. its plant orthologues also contain domains which can be traced back to prokaryotic proteins but with unknown function such as duf <dig> in pthda <dig> and duf <dig> in pphda <dig>  however, its monocot orthologues uniquely display variable conserved regions such as rab5-binding domain for both rice orthologues, oshda <dig> and oshda <dig>  this domain allows binding to gtpase rab <dig> necessary for rab5-dependent recruitment of rabaptin <dig> to early endosomal membranes  <cit> . the maize orthologue, mzhda <dig>  on the other hand, contains ranbp <dig> which is known to regulate receptor mediated transport between nucleus and cytoplasm.

in athda <dig>  the conserved histone deacetylase domain was estimated at amino acids 171– <dig> with its active h site at amino acid  <dig>  athda <dig> contains a zinc finger ranbp <dig> type region encoded at amino acids 86– <dig>  this zn finger ranbp <dig> domain also appears to be conserved in its lower plant orthologue, pphda <dig> and pphda <dig>  and monocot orthologues in rice, oshda <dig>  and maize, mzhda <dig>  ranbp <dig> has been well implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport. its zinc finger has a high binding specificity to exportin- <dig> , a nuclear export factor, serving as its docking site for nuclear export  <cit> . moreover, it also contains an uncharacterized duf <dig> protein which is conserved in bacteria. based on the pfam b database, an overlapping domain, pfam-b  <dig>  is encrypted at amino acids 1– <dig>  which is also found in its maize orthologue, mzhda <dig>  at amino acids 24– <dig> and poplar, pthda <dig>  at amino acids 28– <dig>  this uncharacterized pfam-b domain is homologous to a cdna, flj <dig> fis, found in humans and in pufferfish, tetraodon nigroviridis, which encodes a tau-tubulin kinase  <dig> belonging to a ck <dig> ser/thr protein kinase family wherein mutations or defects of which causes spinocerebrallar ataxia. this coincides with the interpro signature database classifying this region as a short repeat motif that will not fold into a globular domain on its own unless more copies are present. tau-tubulin proteins generally promote microtubule assembly and stabilize microtubules. thus, it is possible that athda <dig> may localize and function not only in the cytoplasm but also in the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane as well. in addition, an aspartate-rich region was detected by uniprotkb at amino acid 58– <dig>  the monocot orthologue of athda <dig>  zmhda <dig>  contains a zinc finger c3hc <dig> type ring finger that plays a key role in ubiquitination pathway.

athda <dig> is a tandem duplication of athda <dig> with mutational insertions and deletions including an additional α helical domain near its c terminal region. aside from a coiled-coil domain and leucine zip motif, based on the pfam database, athda <dig> also contains a domain of unknown function, duf <dig>  at amino acids 43– <dig> which can be traced back to archea and eubacteria. it also contains a 60s acidic ribosomal protein encoded at amino acids 193– <dig> which serves a structural component of ribosome for translational elongation. at amino acids 402– <dig>  a cr <dig> interaction protein is encrypted which is known to be involved in growth arrest and dna-damage inducible protein interaction. cr <dig> interaction protein act as negative regulators of g <dig> and s cell cycle phase progression by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases. they also function as a repressor of orphan nuclear receptor, nr4a <dig>  by inhibiting ab domain-mediated transcriptional activity  <cit> . also, a conserved oligomeric complex, cog <dig>  domain is found at amino acids 629– <dig>  cog <dig> is a component of a conserved oligomeric golgi complex and is required for normal golgi morphology and localization  <cit> . there are other  <dig> pfam-b matches for athda <dig> which still remains to be described and annotated.

for class iv, athda <dig> contains a domain of unknown function, duf <dig>  at amino acids 75– <dig> generally described as short conserved sequences found mostly in hypothetical oryza sativa proteins with unknown function. furthermore, a regulator of rna terminal phosphate cyclase, rtcr, is encrypted at amino acids 297– <dig>  this is usually found at the central region of protein sequences and is known as a sigma54-dependent enhancer binding protein which activates the transcription of the rtcba operon  <cit> .

subcellular localization
bioinformatics data were generated from five different programs to predict the possible localization sites of class ii & iv hdas . forecasts from tair were limited only to athda <dig> and athda <dig> with no localization predictions to athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  or athda <dig>  the subcellular localization of proteins using local alignment  program  <cit> , on the other hand, generated very low reliability scores in the predicted subcellular localization of class ii and class iv histone deacetylases. similarly, wolf psort  <cit>  reported low observed frequency values for both classes of hdas. however, athda <dig> scored relatively high for both nuclear and cytoplasmic localizations suggesting a possibility for nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. netnes predicts nuclear export signals  in athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig> with a threshold value of  <dig> . surrounding amino acids of predicted nes residues also exhibit low intensity signals below the set threshold value. based on sequence analyses of psort ii, athda <dig>  athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig> contain nuclear localization signals  which follow a bipartite, pattern  <dig>  or pattern  <dig> type nls.

b the predictions of wolf psort is based on the protein's amino acid sequence identifying target signals from proteins in the dataset which truly localize in the area. the numbers in parenthesis indicate the prior probability that such protein localizes to a given site is equal to the proportion of proteins in wolf psort's dataset which is  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

c netnes results indicate predicted nuclear export signal  with the corresponding amino acid number and residue. a netnes score of  <dig>  was set as a threshold for positive nes prediction although residues surrounding the predicted nes usually exhibit signal intensities below the set threshold value.

d numbers reflect amino acid residues exhibiting nuclear localization signals . types of nls detected from class ii were either bipartite or the classical type, pat <dig> or pat <dig>  derived from sv <dig> large t antigen. pattern for bipartite nls follows  <dig> basic k/r residues,  <dig> residue spacer, and another basic region composed of at least  <dig> k/r residues out of  <dig> amino acids. pattern  <dig>  is composed of  <dig> basic residues  or  <dig> basic residues and either h or p. pattern  <dig>  starts with p then followed within  <dig> residues by a basic segment with  <dig> k/r residues out of  <dig>  nls score delineates the tendency of the protein to be either nuclear or cytoplasmic which is calculated based on its amino acid composition according to the neural network developed by reinhardt & hubbard . positive numbers indicate higher probability for nuclear localization whereas negative numbers lean towards more cytoplasmic localization.

expression patterns of rpd3/hda <dig> family histone deacetylases
based on the genevestigator from the microarray data generated by schmidt et al  <cit>  and kilian et al.  <cit> , athda <dig> and athda <dig> expressions significantly predominate other class i histone deacetylases in all the vegetative parts as well as developmental stages of the plant . the highest expression for athda <dig> can be observed at the germinating seeds and bolting stages as well as imbibed seeds. in addition, cold stress significantly induces its expression. athda <dig> is at its peak during developed rosette stage and concentrate mostly in the cotyledons. elevated expression of athda <dig> can further be enhanced by ja and ga treatment. it can be observed that athda <dig> appears equally expressed in all the plant parts all throughout the developmental stages but is highly modulated by biotic stress induced by nematode. on the contrary, athda <dig> do not seem to be expressed at all in any parts of the plant nor during developmental stages. however, its expression can be induced by ethylene, light intensity, heat, and biotic stress by pseudomonas syringae. the expression patterns of athda <dig> and athda <dig> are similar in all the plant parts in all the developmental stages and consistently the same still in response to all the stress treatments.

on the other hand, class ii histone deacetylases have varied expression patterns with athda <dig> predominating mostly all developmental stages with its peak of expression during mature silique stage and in pollen and cauline leaf parts. athda <dig> manifests its expression starting at the seedling stage with its highest during young flower. in addition, athda <dig> is significantly expressed at the root tip and pollen while athda <dig> is at its highest during boulting stage and in cork and xylem. although athda <dig> appears to be at a minimum during developmental stages and organ parts, its expression can be induced by iaa, sa, and cold treatment. moreover, heat stress seems to upregulate most of the class ii hdas while nacl treatment only stimulates athda <dig> and athda <dig> expression. furthermore, the expression levels of all these genes, especially athda <dig> and athda <dig> are somehow affected by biotic stress induced specifically by pseudomonas syringae.

discussion
with the exception of athda <dig> and athda <dig>  all the rpd3/hda <dig> family histone deacetylases studied contain histidine as an active site. active sites are usually known as catalytic pockets of enzymes where a substrate is bound and converted to a product which is eventually released. in this case, acetyl groups are released. thus, since most of the rpd3/hda <dig> histone deacetylases contain histidine as an active site, it can then be speculated that all these hdacs are functional as a histone deacetylase. however, mutational inactivation studies such as converting histidine to tyrosine still needs to be conducted to confirm the functionality of these active sites. although hda <dig> and hda <dig> both contain the conserved rpd <dig> histone deacetylase domain, they may not be enzymatically functional due to the absence of an active site. these two have been speculated to be mere gene fragments but its identical expression in the microarray data may somehow suggest subfunctionalization. however, there is extensive evidence for hdac-hdac interaction in humans where the rpd3-like hshdac <dig> and hshdac <dig> were found in the same multiprotein complex  <cit> . in hshdac <dig>  the c-terminal catalytic domain lacks an active pocket required to activate its enzymatic activity. its deletion, however, led to its sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibitors, trapoxin and sodium butyrate, suggesting that its functional n-terminal and inactive c-terminal catalytic domains interact  <cit> . thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that athda <dig> and athda <dig> may interact and be functional with an active histone deacetylase.

domain analysis indicated that athda <dig>  athda <dig> and athda <dig> have a poly-glycine rich region in the histone deacetylase domain. in addition, both athda <dig> and athda <dig> have an aspartate rich region at the c terminus. furthermore, athda <dig> contains a bh3-only pro-apoptotic domain  which is known to bind with 14-3- <dig>  thus, may undergo nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. the specific domains identified in different class i hdacs suggest functional specification. indeed, athda <dig> appeared to be unique among the class i hdacs in arabidopsis since it is the only one that was found to be important in controlling epigenetic states such as dna and histone methylation  <cit> , although the molecular basis for how athda <dig> is involved in these process is still unclear.

there is extensive evidence to show that plant histone deacetylases act as global transcriptional regulators playing crucial roles in a range of plant developmental processes and plant responses to a variety of environmental stresses  <cit> . athda <dig> has been well studied as a global repressor where 7% of the plant's genome is either up- or down-regulated in hda <dig> mutants  <cit> . furthermore, mutant lines exhibited a wide range of developmental abnormalities affecting flowers and siliques, premature death of seedlings, reduced male & female fertility, and embryonic defects  <cit> . athda <dig> has also been shown to work antagonistically with gcn <dig> to regulate light-mediated processes  <cit> . upon biotic stress such as wounding and pathogen infection, it regulates gene expression in ja and ethylene signaling pathways  <cit> . in a recent study by kim et al  <cit> , it has been demonstrated that athda <dig> regulates plant basal response via interaction with wrky transcription factors. similar to athda <dig>  athda <dig> is also known as a global repressor involved in ja pathway, senescence, flowering, and repression of embryonic properties  <cit> .

prior studies by pandey et al.  <cit>  on the sequence analysis of athda <dig> and athda <dig> suggested s. cerevisiae hdac protein hos <dig> as the closest related protein but with very low bootstrap support. thus, with the failure to identify more closely related proteins to hda <dig> and hda <dig>  other than hos <dig>  they have concluded athda <dig> and athda <dig> to be mere relatives of class ii proteins with athda <dig> seemingly more related to the prokaryotic acetylpolyamine aminohydrolase proteins than class ii. with the recent updates of databases, we have data mined and analyzed the possible orthologues of these  <dig> proteins in both lower and higher plants establishing its classification as a class ii histone deacetylase. moreover, the formation of three clusters separating the athda <dig> group, athda <dig> group, and the originally identified class ii genes, athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig> may suggest functional diversification.

with athda <dig> containing a ranbp <dig> type zinc finger which serves as a docking site for exportin- <dig> for nuclear export, it also contains a tau-tubulin kinase  <dig> which promotes microtubule assembly and stabilization which oftentimes result in a stiffening effect of the microtubules. thus, this may append the potential of athda <dig> to localize not only in the cytoplasm but aggregate as well in microtubules, cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. on the other hand, athda <dig> may play multiple roles other than histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression. with its multiple conserved domains intact, it is probable that hda <dig> may also play crucial roles in translational elongation, cell cycle inhibition, dna-damage mechanisms, and golgi morphology. although its amino acid sequence is merely a product of duplication of athda <dig> coupled with evolutionary winnowing, athda <dig> appears to be an interesting protein among the class ii hdas due to its multiple conserved domains and upregulation by stress treatments. however, functional analyses such as loss-of-function and/or gain-of-function studies as well as localization analysis are needed to further analyze its potential functions.

athda <dig> has been implicated to have an active role in root epidermal patterning such that reduced hdac activity via trichostatin a  treatment deregulates the expression of key patterning genes glabra <dig> , caprice  and werewolf   <cit> . such deregulation had led to elevated expression of cpc and gl <dig> at the hair forming  position leading to increased root hair formation and altered cellular patterning in hda <dig> mutants. although hda <dig> and hda <dig> mutants similarly exhibited increased root hairs, only hda <dig> was implicated to be involved in root epidermal patterning due to its altered cellular pattern similarly manifested by tsa treated plants. however, it still remains unclear how hda <dig> specifically takes part at the interplay between these key genes in root epidermal patterning and the yet unidentified "positional cue". in a recent study conducted by caro et al  <cit> , a gl2-expression modulator  is recruited specifically at the promoter regions of cpc and gl <dig> manifesting histone h <dig> hyperacetylation and h3k <dig> methylation restricting cell division and negatively regulating gl <dig> expression. assuming the cr <dig> domain in athda <dig> is functional, there is a possibility for athda <dig> acting in tandem with gem maintaining a closed chromatin configuration at the gl <dig>  cpc, and/or wer loci while simultaneously modulating cell division by inhibiting cyclin dependent kinases for dna licensing. in another perspective, there is a possibility for functional redundancy between hda <dig> and hda <dig>  since hda <dig> is basically a duplication of hda <dig> and share 84% homology mostly in the conserved hda domain  <cit> .

most of the plant class ii hdacs contain nuclear export and import signals indicating their potential for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. similar to mammalian class ii hdacs, all  <dig> plant class ii hdacs contain conserved ser/thr residues  which are potential phosphorylation sites for 14-3- <dig> binding. however, mammalian class ii hdacs are group into class iia  and class iib   <cit> . class iia hdacs are dependent on 14-3- <dig> binding to translocate into the cytoplasm and binds with myocyte enhance factor  <dig>  when it shuttles back to the nucleus and becomes active as a histone deacetylase. on the other hand, class iib hdacs contain double domains and are dependent on strong nes and nls for its nuclear import and export. in plants, however, all the class ii hdas may potentially be regulated via 14-3- <dig> proteins for cytoplasmic translocation. given the proper signals for these hdas to be translocated back into the nucleus, dephosphorylated, and activated as a histone deacetylase, they may bind to mads-box type ii transcription factors which are the plant homologues of mef <dig>  <cit> .

in addition, athda <dig> is still neither classified as class i nor class ii but rather confirms pandey et al  <cit>  findings isolating it as a separate group within the rpd3/hda <dig> superfamily. to refrain from ambiguous and overlapping class groupings, athda <dig> and its plant orthologues have been classified as class iv since athda <dig> is the plant orthologue of the mammalian hshda <dig> previously designated as class iv  <cit> . although we found its corresponding orthologues from all the six plants studied, it still remains unclear how this protein differs from class i and class ii other than functional diversification. in terms of localization based on bioinformatics, athda <dig> may similarly be exported out of the nucleus just like class ii hdas due to the presence of multiple nes. however, the mechanisms underlying such process may be different from class ii. with the rtcr imprinted within its sequence, it is more likely that athda <dig> remains nuclear as it may be actively involved in regulating the transcription of the rtcba operon. nevertheless, further experiments should be conducted to confirm its localization site/s as well as functional activities within and outside the nucleus.

it should be noted, however, that all the class ii and class iv histone deacetylases still contain conserved domains with unknown functions which can be traced back from prokaryotic origins. based on its evolutionary history, histone deacetylases belong to an ancient protein superfamily which also includes acetoin ulitilization proteins and acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases found in eubacteria and archeal bacteria, respectively. thus, the evolutionary retention of these domains suggests critical functions which may or may not influence its role as a histone deacetylase.

CONCLUSIONS
the rpd3/hda <dig> histone deacetylase family in plants is divided into three distinct groups namely, class i, class ii, and class iv. all the  <dig> genes studied from six different plant species were grouped accordingly identifying their corresponding orthologues. moreover, class ii comprises not only athda <dig>  athda <dig>  and athda <dig> but also includes athda <dig> and athda <dig> with their parallel orthologues from all the six plants exhibiting similar conserved domains. although there is a high prognosis for this group to translocate both in the nucleus and cytoplasm due to the presence of nes, nls, and conserved ser/thr residues for 14-3- <dig> binding, intensive studies are needed to further support this. if plant class ii hdas can indeed translocate into the cytoplasm, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling then becomes a hallmark for all class ii histone deacetylases likely conserved in the eukaryotes. thus, it is speculated that this novel characteristic trait may be well encrypted within its conserved regions which is part and parcel of its versatile function and regulation as a histone deacetylase. in addition, there are numerous conserved domains imprinted within each rpd3/hda <dig> protein indicating versatile functions other than histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression but also in phosphate abc transport, microtubule assembly, and golgi morphology just to name a few. nevertheless, further studies are still needed to elucidate clearly the functional roles of these histone deacetylases in plants.
