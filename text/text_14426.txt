BACKGROUND
trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of chagas disease, a chronic sickness that affects  <dig> million people worldwide, mostly in latin america where it was entirely confined although it has now spread to other continents . this intracellular, protozoan parasite has been extensively studied because of its impact on human health, but also because of the interesting molecular characteristics of the family trypanosomatidae, which shows some unusual features of gene transcription.

the sequencing of trypanosomatid genomes has shown them all to contain a large number of active and inactive retrotransposons that together make up to 5 % of the nuclear genome  <cit> . retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that move from one site in the genome to another via the reverse transcription of their own rna. the best represented retrotransposons in trypanosomatids are the non-ltr retrotransposons, which move via a mechanism known as target-primed reverse transcription   <cit> , in which the rna encoded by the element is reverse transcribed and the newly synthesized dna copy inserted at a new site in the genome  <cit> . among the non-ltr retrotransposons are the long interspersed nucleotide elements , i.e., long, autonomous elements that code for proteins that mediate the transposition mechanism, and the short interspersed nucleotide elements , i.e., short non-coding elements that have to be mobilized in trans by the enzymatic machinery encoded by lines. the best characterized line is l1tc of t. cruzi  <cit>  which, together with the ingi element of t. brucei  were the first identified elements in, and the name-givers to, the ingi/l1tc clade  <cit> . homologous elements are now known in the t. vivax  and t. congolense  genomes. truncated versions of these lines - short, non-coding elements - also exist in the t. cruzi, t. brucei, t. vivax and t. congolense genomes   <cit> . further, trypanosomatid genomes contain versions of the long and short elements known as degenerate ingi/l1tc-related elements   <cit>  and short interspersed degenerate retrotransposons . these have accumulated a huge number of mutations that have disabled their coding capacity. the expansion of the siders has been different in different genera. thus, in the t. brucei genome, some  <dig> copies of siders have been detected per haploid genome, whereas in leishmania species there are around  <dig> copies per haploid genome  <cit> .

all these retrotransposons share a common 77 nt sequence at their 5′ ends known as pr <dig>  the pr77-signature, or the pr77-hallmark, independent of their length, their autonomy in terms of mobility related to their coding/non-coding capacity, and their degree of degeneration  <cit> . pr <dig> was originally described in l1tc and was shown to activate the transcription of downstream genes, generating abundant transcripts via rna polymerase ii  <cit> . pr <dig> promoter–derived unspliced transcripts initiate at or close to nucleotide + <dig> and are efficiently translated  <cit> . l1tc has coding capacity for an apurinic/apyrimidinic  endonuclease  that may well determine the composition and proportions of the products translated from l1tc  <cit> . the recent identification of a functional hepatitis delta virus-like structure covering the first 77 nt of the 5′ end of the l1tc and nartc retrotransposon mrnas-l1tcrz, a structure with hdv-ribozyme function  <cit> , is the first dual promoter/ribozyme system to be discovered that works at the dna/rna levels respectively. the pr <dig> signature-bearing retrotransposons may well be responsible for the expansion of these functions across trypanosomatid genomes  <cit> .

the organization of trypanosomatid genomes is unusual. the genes are tandemly repeated and organized in long clusters that converge or diverge in the strand switch regions  where polycistronic transcription initiates . since the ssrs appear to be accumulation regions for non-ltr retrotransposon sites, it has been suggested that pr <dig> promoter activity may be responsible for the transcription of adjacent genes and polycistrons  <cit> .

this paper describes the identification, in pr <dig> of l1tc, of a downstream core promoter element  motif. this 4 nt-long motif  is located at position + <dig> to + <dig> relative to the + <dig> transcription start site  of l1tc mrna. the composition and location of the dpe motif was found to be conserved in most pr <dig> signatures from trypanosomatid retrotransposons. overexpression of a reporter gene by pr <dig> in t. cruzi transfectants, along with point mutations introduced into pr <dig>  showed the dpe to be involved in pr <dig> promoter activity, although other nucleotides in this sequence were found to be also important in transcription activation. furthermore, it is also shown that parasite’ nuclear factors specifically bind to the dpe sense sequence and other positions in pr <dig> sequence.

RESULTS
pr <dig> promoter contains a downstream promoter element
in previous work, we reported the presence of an rna pol ii internal promoter involving the first  <dig> nucleotides  of the 5′end of the l1tc retrotransposon. pr77-derived transcripts initiating at the + <dig> nucleotide of pr <dig> are very abundant and readily translated  <cit> . to identify the sequences within pr <dig> responsible for gene transcription activation, several sequence analyses were performed. no tata box was found in the pr <dig> upstream sequence, nor were any regulatory elements known to be involved in transcription predicted. however, comparison of the pr <dig> sequence with i) lines from drosophila melanogaster and other species with confirmed or expected rna pol ii internal promoters, ii) retrotransposons from d. melanogaster, iii) non-tata genes from drosophila and mammals, which are regulated and which have a transcriptionally important downstream element, and iv) some developmentally regulated non-tata genes, revealed the maintenance in pr <dig> of a small core sequence conserved in all the transcribed sequences described by arkhipova et al.  <cit>  . this downstream promoter element is composed of  <dig> nucleotides, cgtg, and lies in pr <dig> at positions + <dig> to + <dig> of the nucleotide + <dig> of l1tc mrna. this conserved sequence, and its location with respect to the reported transcription initiation site, corresponds to that described for downstream promoter elements known as dpes  <cit> . when the pr <dig> sequence comparisons were performed from different copies of l1tc present in the genomes of brener, brenerel, brenernel, dm28c, sylviox <dig> and marinkellei b <dig> strains , most of them were seen to be identical . although some showed differences in one or two nucleotides, the complete dpe was conserved in more than 99 % of the elements . this degree of conservation suggests this motif is essential in pr <dig> promoter activity.fig.  <dig> diagram of the l1tc element including the pr <dig> sequence. a diagram of the l1tc retrotransposon from t. cruzi. the coding sequences for ap endonuclease , reverse transcriptase , rnaseh , the nucleic acid chaperone  proteins, and a 2a-self cleaving sequence, are shown in boxes. the pr <dig> internal promoter is represented by a black flag, and the l1tcrz ribozyme by an empty arrow-head. the sequence of the pr <dig> promoter is shown and the dpe motif labelled in bold face. b alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the 5′ region of the different types of insect retrotransposon and developmentally regulated genes. the transcription start sites are underlined when known. nucleotides are numbered from the transcription start site position . the dpe motif is indicated in bold. a diagram of the dpe motif consensus  with the cgtt variant for the tras <dig> retroelement is shown below the alignment



analyses were then performed to determine whether the dpe of l1tc was conserved in the pr <dig> of other retrotransposons that show conserved sequences and 5′ end location. sequence alignments were performed using clustalw <dig> software and the pr <dig> consensus sequences of other lines from trypanosomes , their truncated versions , siders of african trypanosomes  <cit>  and leishmania species  <cit> , and dires from trypanosomatids  <cit> , which despite accumulating a large number of mutations maintain pr <dig> at their 5′ ends. the dpe motif cgtg was also conserved in terms of sequence composition and distance to the tss in the consensus sequence of l1tco from t. congolense, the ingi elements of t. brucei, t. congolense and t. vivax, the elements corresponding to the truncated versions of the l1tc- and the ingi-retrotransposons  of t. cruzi, t. brucei and t. vivax, in sider  <dig> of t. congolense and sider1a of t. vivax, sider  <dig> from t. brucei, and sider 2a of l. infantum, l. mexicana, l braziliensis, l. panamensis and l. major . however, in the pr <dig> sequence of sider1b-c of t. vivax and t. brucei, and that of sider 2b of l. major, the dpe motif was incomplete. the pr <dig> dpe motif is also conserved in the consensus sequences described by bringaud  <cit>  in the dires elements of t. cruzi and t. brucei .

pr <dig> promoter regions involved in transcriptional activity
to determine whether the identified pr77-dpe was involved in transcription, l1tc-pr <dig> was cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene into the ptex transfection vector . different point mutations were introduced at  <dig> locations in the  <dig> nucleotide sequence   to examine the participation of other conserved nucleotides that might also participate in pr <dig> promoter activity.fig.  <dig> point mutations in the pr <dig> sequence in stable transfectants for analysis of the involvement of these nucleotide positions in the transcription capacity of the pr <dig> promoter. the dpe motif is shadowed in the pr <dig> l1tc sequence. nucleotides are numbered from the l1tc transcription start site . conserved nucleotides among l1tc and nartc from t. cruzi, and ingi and rime from t. brucei, are indicated by asterisks below the pr <dig> sequence. mutant names  are shown on the left hand side and the corresponding nucleotide substitution and position indicated for each mutant. also on the left hand side it is indicated whether the dna secondary structure is not affected , slightly affected  or very affected  by the point mutation, as predicted by the mfold program



mutations were mainly introduced into the conserved nucleotides of the pr <dig> sequences of l1tc, nartc, ingi and rime . thus, the dpe motif - the most likely candidate responsible for pr <dig> promoter activity - was completely  or partially  substituted. the dpe upstream region  that, along with the dpe motif, forms a stable structure  was completely mutated  or partially point mutated , as well as the nucleotides of the sequence located between these two sequences . the first nucleotides forming part of the l1tc-pr <dig> mrna were also completely substituted  or partially mutated . other regions of pr <dig>  including conserved and non-conserved nucleotides were also mutated. mfold predictions were made for all the sequences . on the other hand, some of the described point mutations strongly compromised the stable secondary structure  predicted for pr <dig> l1tc  while others midly    or had no influence at all on the secondary structure . subsequently, t. cruzi epimastigotes were transfected with one each of these constructs  by electroporation, and stable transfectants generated by selection under g <dig> pressure.

the promoter capacity of each pr77-derived mutant was analyzed by northern blotting and quantification of the corresponding pr77-derived cytoplasmic transcripts following hybridization with the α-32p dctp luc coding sequence used as probe. the variations in the episomal copy number, able to be transcribed, were analyzed in most transfectants by hybridization with the α-32p dctp neo probe  to detect the level of neo mrna derived from the transfection vectors employed. differences in rna quantities were checked by staining the gels with ethidium bromide and filters normalized by hybridization with the α-32p dctp kmp <dig> probe . as expected, abundant luc mrna  was seen in the ptexpr77luc transfectants  - approximately  <dig> times that detected for the ptexluc transfected parasites . as shown in fig. 3a-d, the dpe motif is essential for transcription activity since its complete  or partial modification  abolishes the promoter activity. several additional nucleotides also appeared to be strongly involved in transcription, since their substitution abolished  or diminished  pr <dig> promoter activity. however, the pr <dig> mutants  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  maintained a transcriptional activity similar to that of the wild type construct. since the level of neor and kmp <dig> mrnas is similar in all the transfectants analyzed, the differences observed in the level of luc transcripts are not a consequence of differences neither in the episomal plasmid load, able to be transcribed, nor variations in rna quantities.fig.  <dig> analysis of transcriptional activity of pr77-derived sequences in t. cruzi stable transfectants by northern blotting. a, b, c, d cytoplasmic rna from t. cruzi stable transfectants eletroporated with ptexpr77luc or ptexpr77mut1-17luc, was electrophoresed in 1 % denaturing agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with 32p-labelled luc  and kmp <dig>  coding sequences as probes. the ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal rnas is shown below each panel . cytoplasmic rna from wild type y epimastigotes and parasites transfected with the ptexluc construct were used as negative and positive controls . the northern blots were performed three times. the percentage of transcribed luc mrna when using the ptexpr77luc construct is shown below the luc hybridization panel as tr 



in a different attempt to detect possible low rates of luc transcription in any pr77-derived construct in the mutants 1– <dig>  8– <dig> and 16– <dig> transfectants, the luc messenger was reverse transcribed employing a luc reverse primer . the generated cdna was then amplified by pcr using a sense primer corresponding to the 5′end of the pr <dig> sequence  plus the antisense luc primer ctc <dig> . as a quality control for the transfectant mrnas, rt-pcr was performed to detect kmp <dig> mrna as previously described  <cit> . the antisense kmp <dig> primer was used for reverse transcription and the spliced leader sense primer in subsequent pcr amplifications. these assays detected pr77-derived transcripts in the parasites transfected with constructs 4– <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, an amplification band was detected corresponding to the expression of the luc messenger in the reactions for mutants  <dig> and  <dig> . the data suggests that point mutations at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  strongly affected but do not abolished the transcription activity of pr <dig> promoter as the pr77-derived-luc mrnas from mutants  <dig> and  <dig> were detected by rt-pcr, a more sensitive technique that northern blot. to determine whether any of the pr77-dervied luc transcripts had been processed by trans-splicing, the luc cdna synthesized with the ctc <dig> primer was pcr-amplified with a primer corresponding to the spliced leader sequence and the ctc <dig> luc antisense primer . no bands were observed in any reaction with the exception of the plasmid dna employed as a positive control . this was taken as an indication that that all luc mrnas derived from pr77-mutated constructs lacked the spliced leader sequence at the 5′ end . in contrast, and as expected, the reactions performed to analyze the 5′end of the kmp <dig> mrnas showed these to be processed by trans-splicing , and that the quality and integrity of each rna sample was appropriate.fig.  <dig> rt-pcr detection of luc mrnas in t. cruzi stable transfectants and of the 5′ end nature of luc mrnas. cytoplasmic rna from t. cruzi stable transfectants eletroporated with ptexpr77luc or ptexpr77mut1-17luc were used as templates for reverse transcription and subsequent pcr amplification of the luc mrna 5′ end using a primer corresponding to the pr <dig> 5′ end , or the sl primer , as sense primers. as a control of rna quality, the 5′ end of the kmp <dig> rna was reverse transcribed and pcr amplified. the ptexpr77luc and pgemtsl-luc plasmids were used as dnas template in positive control reactions; no dna was used in negative control reactions. mutants are numbered from  <dig> to  <dig> 



to further determine the transcription initiation site of the pr77-derived transcripts, and to identify differences between the mutant constructs in non-essential nucleotides and the wild type pr <dig>  primer extension was performed . total cytoplasmic rnas from the pr <dig> wild type luc construct was used as positive control since pr77-derived transcripts have been established to start at nucleotide + <dig> of pr <dig>  <cit>  and three transcription-positive pr77-derived mutant constructs  were used as substrates in primer extension analysis involving the antisense luc primer . a cdna extension product of 117 nt was generated for both the wild type pr <dig>  and all mutants. the length of this fragment corresponded to having been transcribed from the first nucleotide of the pr <dig> sequence since an extension band of the same size than that generated in the parasites transfected with the pr <dig> wild type luc construct was detected. thus, as for pr <dig>  <cit> , transcription mediated by mutants  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> initiates at nucleotide + <dig>  corroborating the idea that pr77-derived mutant transcripts lack the splice leader sequence, as deduced from the rt-pcr data shown in fig.  <dig> .fig.  <dig> determination of the in vivo transcription start site of luc mrna by primer extension. total rnas from t. cruzi transfected with the ptexpr77luc , ptexpr77m5luc, ptexpr77m7luc or ptexpr77m15luc constructs  were used for primer extension of luc mrnas employing a γ-atp <dig> luc antisense primer . the cdna products were resolved in 8 m urea 8 % polyacrylamide gels. the full length extension products , consistent with the tss  of pr <dig>  and 18-mer radiolabelled oligo luc28rev, are indicated



parasite nuclear proteins bind specifically to the pr <dig> sequence and to the dpe itself
emsas were next performed to determine whether the nuclear proteins of t. cruzi specifically bind to the pr <dig> sequence. a 32p-radiolabelled double-stranded fragment corresponding to the pr <dig> full-length sequence  was incubated with 3 μg of parasite nuclear protein extract, and the reaction resolved in 5 % polyacrylamide native gels. two shifted bands were detected, indicating binding between the pr <dig> sequence and the parasite proteins . no bands of reduced mobility were detected when binding assays were performed using a 32p-labelled probe corresponding to the human il <dig> sequence and parasite nuclear extracts . the shifted complex formed between the pr <dig> sequence and parasite nuclear proteins  seems to be the result of specific binding between this particular sequence of dna and the parasite nuclear proteins. certainly, binding displacement between pr <dig> and the nuclear proteins was entire when a 50-fold excess of unlabelled dspr <dig> competitor dna was added to the reaction . however, no displacement of the shifted complex was seen when a pool of 77 bp-long aptamer fragments with variable sequence compositions was included in the binding reaction as a competitor .fig.  <dig> binding of t. cruzi nuclear proteins to the pr <dig>  dpe-mutated pr <dig>  and dpe-bearing sequences. a double-stranded dna corresponding to the pr <dig> , or pr <dig> sequence mutated at the dpe motif , were 5′ end radiolabelled with γ-atp <dig> and loaded onto native 6 % polyacrylamide gels with  or without  incubation with t. cruzi nuclear proteins . competition assays were performed by adding as competitors  non-labelled dnas corresponding to the pr <dig> sequence , a mixture of aptamers  or dspr77m <dig> to the reactions at a ratio of 1: <dig> or 1: <dig> as indicated in each panel. b double-stranded dna corresponding to the pr <dig> sequence bearing the dpe motif  was 5′ end radiolabelled with γ-atp <dig> and loaded onto native 12 % polyacrylamide gels with incubation  or without  incubation with t. cruzi nuclear proteins . competition assays were performed by adding as competitor  non-labelled dsdpe dna to the reactions at a ratio of 1: <dig>  shifted bands are indicated with an arrowhead, and the free probe indicated as ‘fp’



the involvement of the dpe in the observed binding was examined via emsas performed with the nuclear protein extracts employed above and a 32p-labelled dsdna corresponding to the pr <dig> sequence of mutant  <dig>  i.e., which had completely mutated dpe . lane 32p-dspr77m <dig> of fig. 6a shows a shifted band , the result of binding between the dpe-mutated pr <dig> sequence and the parasite nuclear proteins. a partial displacement of the binding complex was seen when a 1: <dig> excess of cold dna corresponding to the pr <dig> sequence of mutant  <dig> was added to the reaction. when the competitor was cold dna with the pr <dig> sequence, a displacement of the dna-protein complex was observed at a dna/competitor ratio of 1: <dig>  this displacement was entire when a 1: <dig> ratio was employed . these findings suggest that parasite nuclear proteins specifically bind to different regions of the pr <dig> sequence, although the strongest binding is with the dpe.

to corroborate the involvement of the dpe motif in the binding capacity of the nuclear proteins, an emsa was performed using nuclear extracts of the parasite and a 32p-labelled dpe-containing a dsdna fragment with a sequence corresponding to nucleotides + <dig> to + <dig> of the pr <dig> sequence . a band of reduced mobility was obtained when the total proteins of the parasite were incubated with the mentioned 32p-labelled dsdpe dna . this binding was displaced by a 5-molar excess of cold dsdpe dna, indicating sequence-specific binding.

independent of dna secondary structure, parasite nuclear proteins bind to the sense strand of the sequence bearing the dpe
to determine whether the nuclear proteins bound the sense or antisense strand of the pr <dig> dna, binding reactions were performed incubating the 32p-labelled dpe in the form of a double-stranded dna molecule , and the dpe oligos corresponding to the sense  and antisense sequences , with the parasite nuclear proteins. specific, shifted bands were detected when the dsdpe dna and sense dpe oligo were used , but not when the asdpe oligo was used . together, these data suggest that, in dna binding by t. cruzi nuclear proteins, the dpe motif is strongly involved with the sense single-stranded sequence, apparently being required in dna-protein recognition.fig.  <dig> binding analysis of t. cruzi nuclear proteins to dpe-bearing dna as double strand dna and single strand dpe-bearing oligos  in native and heat denatured conditions. a dna corresponding to the double-stranded dpe-bearing pr <dig> sequence , single stranded sense dpe oligo , single stranded antisense dpe oligo  and the heat denatured sdpe and asdpe oligos, was 5′ end radiolabelled with γ-atp <dig> and  <dig>  cpm of each radiolabeled probe loaded onto native 12 % polyacrylamide gels with  or without  incubation with t. cruzi nuclear proteins . the mobility of the highest amount of radiolabelled free probe is indicated as free probe . asterisks indicate the shifted bands that are formed when nuclear proteins are incubated with both 32p- single stranded sense dpe and heat denatured 32p- single stranded sense dpe. b binding of nuclear proteins to the pr <dig> sequence and competition assays with dpe-bearing dnas. double-stranded dna corresponding to the entire pr <dig> sequence  was 5′ end radiolabelled with γ-atp <dig> and loaded onto native 6 % polyacrylamide gels with incubation  or without  incubation with t. cruzi nuclear proteins . competition reactions were performed by adding to the reaction non-labelled dnas corresponding to the dsdpe sequence, the single stranded dpe oligo  or the single stranded dpe antisense oligo  as competitors  at ratios of 1: <dig>  shifted bands are indicated by black arrows on both sides of the gel . gel wells are indicated as ‘w’



the involvement of the pr <dig> dna secondary structure in the dna binding capacity of the dpe-sequence by parasite nuclear proteins was examined by emsas performed using separately heat-denatured sense and antisense strands of the dpe oligo . conformer formation was seen when the nuclear proteins were incubated with the sense dpe oligo and denatured sense dpe oligo  but not with the denatured antisense oligo . this was taken as an indication of the sequence specific binding of the t. cruzi nuclear proteins to the dpe bearing sense sequence of  <dig> nucleotides in length which together with the dpe motif includes nucleotides that in mutants  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed to compromise the transcription activity of the pr <dig> sequence . this was corroborated by binding assays involving t. cruzi nuclear proteins and the 32p-labelled-dspr <dig> sequence, and binding displacement via the addition of cold double-stranded dpe oligos and the corresponding sense- and antisense dpe oligos. thus, and as observed in fig. 7b , the dpe sense oligo displaced the conformer produced as a result of the binding of nuclear proteins to the dspr <dig> sequence. this did not occur when using the same amount of asdpe oligo or 1: <dig> of the dsdpe cold dna as competitors. together, these data suggest that pr <dig> has binding sites for nuclear proteins other than the dpe, although the latter, in the sense strand, is the site of strongest binding.

discussion
transcription is the first step in the mobilization of retrotransposons and is critical for the successful maintenance of these elements in host genomes. many non-specific sites for the insertion of non-ltr retrotransposons are transcribed from their 5′ ends by internal promoters  <cit> . this gives transcriptional autonomy to these elements - they are independent of any regulatory sequences upstream of the insertion site.

the present work describes the identification of a downstream core promoter element in pr <dig> of the l1tc retrotransposon, known to drive gene transcription via rnapol ii  <cit> . the core promoter is defined as the dna stretch that directs the initiation of transcription by the latter enzyme. these core promoter elements are modular in structure and may contain elements such as a tata box, a tfiib recognition element , an inr  element, a motif ten element , and a downstream promoter element   <cit> . however there are no universal promoter elements. the pr <dig> dpe motif is just four nucleotides in length , located between positions + <dig> to + <dig> relative to the previously described tss . following the juven-gershon, t. and kadonaga, j.t. description  <cit>  and in contrast to the “dispersed” promoters with tsss, the presence of a dpe motif within the pr <dig> sequence shows pr <dig> promoter to be of the focused type. this is consistent with the results of previous studies on tss-derived transcripts of pr <dig>  <cit> . the pr <dig> dpe is conserved in terms of sequence composition and location within the consensus sequences of the pr77-hallmarks of trypanosomatid retrotransposons, independent of their coding or non-coding nature or degree of degeneration - with the exception of the tbsider <dig>  tvsider1b-c and lmsider2b elements which all carry a mutated dpe. experimental evidence of the functionality of the pr <dig> sequences of these elements is still required.

the dpe in the pr <dig> promoter sequence is the first consensus downstream promoter element to be identified in trypanosomatids. the dpe motif is conserved from drosophila to humans, and is usually located  + <dig> to +32 nt downstream of the tss. it is more abundant in tata-less promoters, although some promoters contain both dpe and tata motifs  <cit> . in some cases, dpe works as an antagonist of tata-boxes since stimuli that activate dpe-dependent transcription repress tata-dependent transcription  <cit> . there are many cases of dpe motifs within non-ltr retrotransposon promoters in insects. such is the case of the drosophila jockey, doc, g, i and f, and the bombyx mori sart <dig> and tras <dig> non-ltr retrotransposons. all these house a dpe motif in their core promoters   <cit> . in some, the transcription start site has been experimentally determined, and shown to lie at a constant distance from the dpe motif .

the total or partial mutation of the dpe of l1tc completely abolished the transcription capacity of pr <dig>  indicating this sequence to be essential for pr <dig> promoter activity. however, other positions in the pr <dig> sequence are involved in its transcription activity. as deduced from the results provided by the transfectants containing the mutated pr77-luc constructs, the first nucleotides of pr <dig>  are critical for l1tc-pr <dig> transcription activity. however, the point mutations in mutants 9– <dig>  which were directed at the first nucleotides of the pr <dig> sequence, had no influence on the secondary structure of pr <dig> as predicted by the mfold program. other positions in pr <dig> also appear to be important for transcription capacity, some of which do influence the secondary structure of pr <dig>  mutants  <dig> and  <dig>  which bore mutations in the same position  are an interesting case in point. mutant  <dig> conserves the promoter capacity and the secondary structure of the sequence, while mutant  <dig> has lost the promoter activity and the secondary structure of pr <dig>  the nucleotides experimentally shown to be essential in the transcription activity of the pr <dig> sequence are likely targets for the binding of transcription factors that mediate pr <dig> transcription function.

emsas performed with protein extract showed the nuclear proteins of the parasite to specifically bind to pr <dig>  the shifted bands resulting from binding were displaced when pr <dig> cold dna was used as a competitor, but not when the same amount of a commercial mix of aptamers was used . the observed binding was sequence specific, and although the strongest binding involved the dpe sequence, other nucleotides also bound the nuclear proteins. this explains the shifted band seen when the dpe-mutated pr <dig> sequence  was incubated with the nuclear proteins, and why the shifted conformers were more efficiently displaced with smaller amounts of dspr <dig> than ds pr77m <dig> . the nuclear proteins that bind to the dpe sequence do so on the sense strand of the dna . the identification of the nuclear proteins that specifically bind to the dpe motif and pr <dig> sequence is currently in progress, together with the analysis of the capacity to compete the protein binding of the mutants that compromise the pr77-transcriptional activity.

the dpe motif is a tfiid complex recognition site  <cit> . footprinting analyses performed with the internal promoter of the drosophila jockey  mobile element  showed that etfiid binds to the promoter in a region that extends from the vicinity of the rna start site to about + <dig> to +35 nt downstream  <cit> . this is consistent with the results of previous studies with these tata-less promoters, which suggested that efficient transcription from them did not require sequences upstream of the rna start site in the location where a tata box would normally be located . in turn, this is consistent with the promoter activity that mediates l1tc transcription being restricted to the pr <dig> sequence.

although core promoter elements share the common function of directing the initiation of transcription, they may have different transcriptional properties and mechanisms, a result of their particular core promoter elements. thus, the basal transcription factors that transcribe tata-dependant core promoters are not able to mediate the transcription of dpe-dependant promoters  <cit> . moreover factors such as tbp, mot <dig> and nc <dig> influence transcription from tata-dependant promoters differently to dpe-dependant core promoters  <cit> . core promoter diversity thus allows for a range of complex regulatory mechanisms by which eukaryotes can control gene expression.

trypanosomatid retrotransposons have spread pr <dig> throughout the genome of host organisms  <cit> , thus distributing a tool for the regulation of gene expression. the transcriptional activity of the pr <dig> sequence and the known accumulation of retroelements in the strand switch regions of trypanosomatids where the polycistronic transcription is initiated may be an indication of the influence of pr <dig> in this process. actually, the number of l1tc elements in frame with the genes where these elements are inserted is one order of magnitude higher that those elements that are out frame as deduced from the analysis of the l1tc elements available in the t. cruzi genomes  . moreover, considering all the available t. cruzi genomes, the number of the l1tc elements in the divergent regions is  <dig>  times higher than that from convergent strand switch regions . histone variants related to the initiation of polycistronic transcription in t. brucei has been also detected close to the repetitive sequences located in the subtelomeric and centromeric regions  <cit> . however, as these regions are poorly annotated they have not been analyzed in detail  <cit> . together with the promoter activity of the pr <dig> sequence at the dna level, hdv-ribozyme activity has been reported for the pr <dig> sequence at the rna level . it remains unknown whether these functions are coupled. mutations of dpe compromise the promoter activity of pr <dig> dna, and impair the hdv-ribozyme function of pr <dig> rnas  since the p <dig> loop, which is required for the correct hdv-folding of pr <dig> rna  is affected. other point mutations in pr <dig> that do not compromise the pr <dig> promoter function has influence on the hdv-ribozyme activity when the nucleotides involved in loop formation are affected . work is underway to confirm the above and to identify the factors that mediate pr <dig> promoter activity.

CONCLUSIONS
the first  <dig> nucleotides of the t. cruzi l1tc retrotransposon, pr <dig>  are conserved in most retrotransposons of trypanosomatids and has been consequently named as pr77-hallmark. herein, it is described the identification and implication of a downstream promoter element  in the promoter function of l1tc pr <dig> to which nuclear factors are strongly and specifically bound. conservation of dpe sequence is maintained in the pr <dig> sequence of most retrotransposons of trypanosomatids independently of their autonomous or non-autonomous character and their degree of degeneration. accumulation of retroelements in the strand switch regions of trypanosomatids where the polycistronic transcription is initiated suggests that these elements are involved in this process reinforcing the important role of retroelements in gene expression regulation of host genomes.
