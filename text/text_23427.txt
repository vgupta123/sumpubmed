BACKGROUND
development of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in streptococcus pneumoniae involves alterations in the target proteins, the penicillin-binding proteins  which result in decreased affinity to beta-lactams. in order to identify individual mutations in s. pneumoniae that are related to the resistance phenotype, a series of independent mutant families has been selected in the laboratory using stepwise increasing concentrations of antibiotics  <cit> . two beta-lactams were chosen for selection: piperacillin, which induces rapid lysis in the bacteria, and cefotaxime which does not interact with pbp2b and leads to a tolerant response  <cit> . point mutations in pbp2b from piperacillin-resistant mutants and in pbp2x from cefotaxime resistant mutants have been described  <cit> . surprisingly, a decrease in antibiotic susceptibility in some mutants correlated with a mutation in non-pbp genes  <cit> . in two piperacillin-resistant mutants, p <dig> and p <dig>  obtained independently after the first selection step before the introduction of pbp mutations, the putative glycosyltransferase  gene cpoa was affected  <cit> . decreased susceptibility for piperacillin of the cpoa mutants was accompanied by a pleiotropic phenotype such as a defect in genetic competence and reduced amount of pbp1a. this indicated a novel mechanism directed against the activity of lytic β-lactams in s. pneumoniae distinct from target-mediated resistance.

the cpoa gene spr <dig> and the adjacent gene spr <dig> encode putative gts which belong to the gtb-type superfamily . members of this gt family are anchored in the membrane cytoplasmic interface by hydrophobic and charge interactions  <cit>  and transfer a sugar moiety to an acceptor molecule located in the inner leaflet of the membrane. therefore, it had been proposed that cpoa perfoms a similar function in s. pneumoniae <cit> . meanwhile, in vitro studies revealed that both proteins are involved in the synthesis of glycolipids, with spr <dig> acting as α-monoglucosyl-diacylglycerol  synthase and cpoa as a α-galactosyl-glucosyl-diacylgylcerol  synthase  <cit> . these two glycolipids occur at a ratio of approximately 1: <dig>  in the s. pneumoniae membrane  <cit> , in addition to phosphatidyl glycerol and cardiolipin which constitute the major phospholipids  <cit> .

by consecutively synthesizing one nonbilayer-prone  and one bilayer-forming glycolipid , the function of the gts is crucial for the bilayer spontaneous curvature which affects the physical properties of the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . an example is the mycoplasma acholeplasma laidlawii, where bilayer curvature is extensively regulated by two closely related gts consecutively synthesizing monoglucosyl-dag and diglucosyl-dag  <cit> , enzymes that are homologous to s. pneumoniae spr <dig> and cpoa. thus it is most likely that cpoa and spr <dig> play a critical role in s. pneumoniae related to membrane associated functions in agreement with the pleiotropic phenotype of the cpoa mutants mentioned above. glcdag is the proposed lipid anchor of the essential choline-containing lipoteichoic acid  of s. pneumoniae <cit> . in fact, spr <dig> has been listed among essential genes of this organism  <cit> .

in the present report, a cpoa deletion mutant was constructed and compared to the cpoa mutants p <dig> and p104; moreover, the cpoa operon was investigated by mutational analysis. the aim of this study was to examine the function of cpoa in vivo, and to further our understanding on the physiological consequences of cpoa mutations.

RESULTS
the cpoa gene is part of an operon with five downstream genes
p <dig> and p <dig> are spontaneous piperacillin-resistant laboratory mutants isolated independently after one selection step from the laboratory strain s. pneumoniae r <dig>  <cit> . both mutants contain a mutation affecting cpoa: in p <dig>  a transversion within cpoa gta to gga led to a gly12val exchange in the predicted protein product, whereas in p <dig>  one adenine nucleotide was deleted  <dig> base pairs  upstream of the proposed cpoa start codon   <cit> . although atg <dig> is not preceded by a classical shine dalgarno sequence, this deletion was suspected to affect the efficiency of ribosome binding to the cpoa transcript  <cit> . however, the possibility remained that translation actually starts at an alternative start codon  27 bp upstream of atg <dig> which is preceded by a perfect − <dig> region. in this case, the deletion in p <dig> would lead to a frameshift in the 5th codon and thus to the production of a nonsense peptide.

to first clarify this issue, the expression signals of cpoa were mapped. the 5' end of cpoa mrna was determined by race, and shown to be located 27 bp upstream of atg <dig> . since this is exactly the position of the alternative start codon atg <dig>  translation initiation at atg <dig> would imply that the cpoa transcript is leaderless  <cit> . in order to see whether atg <dig> is indeed functional or whether atg <dig> is required for translation, three plasmids were constructed in which the inferred promoter p
cpoa
 together with either both, atg <dig> and atg <dig> , atg <dig> plus a mutated atg <dig> , or atg <dig> only , was translationally fused with the lacz reporter gene. after single-copy integration of the resulting reporter constructs at the bgaa locus of r <dig>  the expression of lacz was determined in two transformants in up to three experiments. beta-galactosidase activity was similar in r6p
cpoa
-atg1atg <dig> and r6p
cpoa
-atg1ata <dig> , and slightly lower in r6p
cpoa
-atg <dig> containing a shorter region upstream of lacz , clearly documenting that atg <dig> is the translation initiation site of cpoa and that the cpoa transcript is indeed leaderless. in this case, p <dig> contains a deletion within the structural gene resulting in a frameshift within the 5th codon consistent with the failure to detect cpoa in p <dig> with a specific anti-cpoa antiserum  <cit> , and the mutation in p <dig> is gly21val.

comparison with the genetic organization of cpoa and upstream regions of the closely related species s. mitis b <dig> and s. oralis uo <dig> of known genome sequence  <cit>  revealed an almost perfect conservation of cpoa including the − <dig> region in these species .

the arrangement of genes and expression signals predicted in the downstream region of p
cpoa
 suggested a polycistronic mrna of approximately  <dig>  kb covering the cpoa-spr <dig> region. this was confirmed by rt-pcr experiments in which six overlapping products were obtained from this region, the largest of which extended from cpoa to spr <dig> . attempts to detect a contiguous transcript of the entire cpoa-spr <dig> region, either by rt-pcr or by northern blot analysis, however, were not successful, probably due to instability of the transcript.

the operon structure of the cpoa-spr <dig> region and bioinformatic analyses indicated that the gene products might be functionally related and involved in membrane-associated functions. the gt-activities of cpoa and spr <dig> have been linked to glycolipid biosynthesis by in vitro experiments  <cit> , spr <dig>  belongs to the pspc superfamily of putative stress-responsive transcriptional regulators, and obg  belongs to the obg subfamily of gtp-binding proteins involved in stress response and processes related to cell division . possible functions of the two small peptides spr <dig>   which has not been annotated in the r <dig> genome and spr <dig>   <cit>  cannot be deduced from the amino acid sequences.

mutational analysis of the cpoa operon
to assess the importance of these gene products, we aimed to construct deletions in each gene. a previous attempt to delete cpoa by insertion-duplication mutagenesis using a non-replicative plasmid vector had been unsuccessful  <cit> . this suggested that either cpoa is essential, or that insertion of the vector had affected the expression of the downstream gene spr <dig> which has been listed among essential genes of s. pneumoniae <cit> . to avoid such polar effects, a different deletion strategy was applied which was based on the construction of in-frame deletions using the janus cassette . r <dig> mutants in which  <dig> central codons of cpoa  were replaced with the janus cassette were obtained with common efficiencies , demonstrating that cpoa is a non-essential gene. deletions in spr <dig> and spr <dig> were also obtained. however, the generation times of r6Δcpoa and r6Δspr <dig>  were significantly longer compared to r <dig> and r6Δspr <dig> , suggesting that cpoa and spr <dig> are involved in important functions. in contrast, transformants carrying deletions in spr <dig> and obg occurred only at  <dig> - and respectively  <dig> -fold reduced frequencies. this is in agreement with an essential function of the spr <dig> product as reported previously  <cit> , and strongly suggested that also obg is indispensable. the rare recovery of transformants carrying deletions in these genes probably was the result of co-selection of compensatory mutations at unknown secondary sites.

mutants in cpoa are defective in synthesis of diglycosyl-dag
to verify the cpoa function in vivo, the membrane lipids of cpoa mutant strains and the parent s. pneumoniae r <dig> were isolated and glycolipids specifically stained after separation by thin layer chromatograpy . s. pneumoniae contains the two glycolipids glcdag and galglcdag. two spots were detected in the r <dig> strain that could be assigned to the pneumococcal glycolipids according to the glycolipid standards: the major one representing a diglycosyl-dag , and a second spot at the position of monoglycosyl-dag . this is in agreement with a ratio of glcdag to galglcdag to be approximately 1: <dig>   <cit> . in contrast, the only glycolipid in all cpoa mutants corresponded to the position of the monoglycosyl-dag . this confirms that cpoa is required for the synthesis of the diglycosyl-dag in s. pneumoniae in agreement with the in vitro galglcdag-synthase activity of cpoa, and documents that both mutants, p <dig> and p <dig>  do not contain a functional cpoa.

phospholipids in cpoa mutants
the glycolipid content affects physical properties of the cytoplasmic membrane. since the exclusive production of the monolayer-forming glycolipid glcdag which forms non-bilayer structures strongly affects the membrane curvature  <cit> , we investigated whether this has some impact on the phospholipid content as well. s. pneumoniae contains the two phospholipids cardiolipin, a non-bilayer prone lipid, and phosphatidylglycerol. lipids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography, and experiments were performed with at least two independently grown cultures. all cpoa mutants  showed a significant increase in the ratio of phosphatidylglycerol: cardiolipin , suggesting that the cells are able to regulate the overall content of bilayer versus non-bilayer forming lipids. it should be noted that phosphadidylglycerol is more strongly stained compared to cardiolipin by the procedure used here .

pleiotropic phenotype of cpoa mutants
the severe changes in membrane lipids in cpoa mutants is consistent with their pleiotropic phenotype described before  <cit>  which included a reduced generation time in liquid medium, decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams, defects in transformability, and a lower amount of pbp1a with less than 20% compared to the parental strain while the pbp1a transcript was unaffected; alterations in other pbps were not detected. we first verified these properties for the r6Δcpoa mutant: the mic of piperacillin increased from  <dig>  μg/ml  to  <dig>  μg/ml, the competence for genetic transformation was approximately 20-fold lower and shifted to the early exponential phase compared to r <dig>  and the amount of pbp1a was decreased . these phenotypes are reminiscent of those displayed by p104/p <dig> but were more pronounced in r6Δcpoa, probably a result of the rpsl allele.

several other tests were then performed in order to see whether the altered glycolipid composition affects also cell envelope related properties in general. these included growth at low ph, the requirement for mg2+, stationary phase autolysis and lysis induced by triton x <dig>  in all experiments, cpoa mutants showed a clear phenotype distinct from the r <dig> strain. growth was severely affected at ph  <dig> . at ph  <dig>  cpoa mutants showed an increased requirement for mg2+ . the stationary phase lysis was slightly delayed in all cpoa mutants . moreover, lysis induced by low concentrations of triton x <dig> proceeded significantly more slowly in all cpoa mutants .

susceptibility to non-beta lactam cell wall antibiotics was also tested. almost no effect was seen with vancomycin  or cycloserine , but the mic value for bacitracin dropped from  <dig>  μg/ml in the r <dig> strain to  <dig>  - 1 μg/ml in all cpoa mutants.

transcription profile of cpoa mutants
the pleiotropic effect of cpoa mutants on many membrane-associated functions was consistent with the relation of cpoa activity to glycolipid biosynthesis. in order to estimate the consequences of the altered glycolipid composition in cpoa mutants, their transcription pattern was determined in comparison to the r <dig> parent strain using an s. pneumoniae r <dig> specific oligonucleotide microarray  <cit> . cells were grown under non-competent conditions at ph  <dig>  in order to avoid the detection of the complex com regulon. only four gene clusters and one single gene were affected in all three mutants. this included the approximately 3-fold downregulation of a pts system  and an abc transporter , and the 5-7-fold upregulation of two abc transporters  and spr <dig> clpl . no effect on pbp genes or genes involved in lipid biosynthesis was apparent.

discussion
glycolipids in cpoa mutants
the two piperacillin-resistant s. pneumoniae laboratory mutants p <dig> and p <dig>  both containing point mutations affecting cpoa production, do not produce detectable amounts of galglcdag, the main glycolipid of this organism. this clearly shows that the glycosysltransferase cpoa of s. pneumoniae is essential for the synthesis of the major glycolipid galglcdag in vivo, and this could be confirmed by cpoa deletion mutants. the data are in agreement with previous in vitro studies using extracts of e. coli overproducing cpoa  <cit> .

apparently, the amino acid change in cpoap <dig> gly21val also results in a non-functional protein. since the mutated protein is still associated with the membrane when cell fractions were probed with anti-cpoa antiserum , it is possible that the gly21val mutation affects protein folding, or its enzymatic function directly or indirectly. in this context it is interesting to note that a missense mutation in cpoa has been identified recently in laboratory mutants selected with cefotaxime  <cit> . the mutation d186y  is located within the conserved region of this type of glycosyltransferases, and it would be interesting to study the glycolipid content and phenotype in this mutant. so far, mutations in cpoa have not been detected in clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. this might not be surprising since glycolipids are involved in critical cellular functions. on the other hand, the study of laboratory mutants resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics provides a valuable tool to unravel physiological processes related to cell envelope biosynthetic processes.

glycolipids and membrane properties
glycolipids are common in gram-positive bacteria, and their distribution across the cytoplasmic membrane represents a critical parameter affecting bilayer curvature of the membrane and lipid surface charge densities, thus also membrane-associated functions  <cit> . glycolipids in the cell wall-less mycoplasma acholeplasma laidlawii are asymmetrically distributed and mainly external  <cit> . clear asymmetry of lipids has also been documented for special membrane systems, such as the purple membrane of the archaebacterium halobacterium halobium where glycolipids were found exclusively in the outer leaflet  <cit> , and for the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . it is likely that also in s. pneumoniae the two glycolipids are arranged asymmetrically in the membrane and probably predominantly located in the outer leaflet.

besides glycolipids, membrane proteins can also contribute substantially to the morphology and curvature of membranes  <cit> . the two gts of a. laidlawii, homologues of spr <dig> and cpoa, have recently been shown to induce membrane vesiculation upon overproduction in e. coli <cit> . these enzymes are monotopic, i.e. anchored in the membrane cytoplasmic interface by hydrophobic and charge interactions in a secyeg-independent manner  <cit> . the data of wikström et al. <cit>  strongly suggest that the gts themselves are capable of inducing vesiculation, i.e. convex bending of the membrane. this implies some possible consequences when cpoa is absent, i.e. in p <dig> and in r6Δcpoa, in that elimination of cpoa itself could affect the curvature of the membrane.

phenotypes of cpoa mutants
failure to synthesize galglcdag, the bilayerforming di-glycosyl-glycolipid, must affect the physical properties of the cytoplasmic membrane considerably, consistent with the pleiotropic phenotype associated with cpoa mutants. introduction of the cpoa point mutations present in p <dig> and p <dig> into the parental r <dig> strain conferred the same phenotypes, strongly suggesting that no other mutations besides cpoa are present in p <dig> and p <dig> . this included higher susceptibility to acidic stress and increased requirement for mg2+ at low ph, as well as reduced lysis rate under lysis inducing conditions. moreover, an altered proportion of the two pneumococcal phospholipids was observed in the cpoa mutants. whereas cardiolipin is the major phospholipid in the parental r <dig> strain, all cpoa mutants contained a considerable higher amount of phosphatidylglycerol relative to cardiolipin as shown in figure  <dig>  interestingly, mutations in the gene encoding the cardiolipin synthase have been identified in cefotaxime resistant laboratory mutants but have not been investigated further  <cit> . since glcdag, the only glycolipid in cpoa mutants, is non-bilayer prone and cardiolipin as well, apparently the cells are capable to regulate the amounts of lipids to ensure sufficient bilayer structure of the cytoplasmic membrane. cross-regulation in membrane lipid pathways has already been suggested in b. subtilis mutants defective in the cardiolipin synthase gene  <cit> . mic values of vancomycin or cycloserine inhibiting late and early stages of peptidogylcan synthesis were not affected in cpoa mutants, an indication that the cell wall biochemistry is not affected.

interestingly, cpoa mutants were ten-fold more susceptible to bacitracin, which targets the lipid molecule bactoprenol. the cpoa mutants expressed an altered transcription profile compared to that of the r <dig> strain, mainly by genes encoding membrane proteins such as pts systems or abc transporters that represent minor components of the bacterial cell. on the other hand, we could not detect significant changes of the protein profile of cytoplasmic or membrane proteins on sds-polyacrylamide gels, i.e. no major protein components were affected in terms of quantity . it is conceivable that the transcriptional changes might be an indirect effect of the altered membrane composition. we recently reported that a higher susceptibility to bacitracin was also noted in s. pneumoniae containing a mutated abc transporter  <cit> . it is possible that the altered lipid composition of the cpoa mutants indirectly affects the abc transporter function and thus bacitracin mic.

glycolipids as anchor molecules in gram-positive bacteria
glycolipids represent the membrane anchor of important membrane-bound cell wall polymers in gram-positive bacteria. they function as the lipid anchor for lta and also for another class of membrane-associated cell wall glycopolymers, lipoglycans, which seem to replace lta in the high gc division of gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . listeria contain the same glycolipids as s. pneumoniae, whereas glcdag and glcglcdag represent the major glycolipids in bacillus, staphylococcus and enterococcus. however, these species differ in their biosynthetic enzymes. in bacillus and staphylococcus, both glycolipids are synthesized by one single gt ypfp  <cit> , whereas two putative gts are involved in glycolipid biosynthesis in listeria, streptococcus and enterococcus <cit> . in this context it is remarkable that the structure of the cpoa operon which includes obg and several putative small peptide encoding genes is only maintained within streptococcus spp., and that other gram-positive bacteria contain cpoa  and obg homologues at distinct positions in the genome. the reason for this is not clear. several studies revealed that obg proteins play a role in many important processes, including dna replication, chromosome segregation, and regulation of stress responses, but their actual function remains unknown .

most of the species mentioned above contain a polyglycerophosphate lta backbone which is anchored to the di-glycosyl-dag lipid. thus, interference of the biosynthesis of this glycolipid severely affects lta and accordingly cell wall integrity as was shown for mutants in the s. aureus gt ypfp  <cit> , the gts lafa in listeria, iaga in group b streptococci, and e. faecalis bgsa  <cit> . deletion mutants of s. aureus ypfp produced lta which was probably attached directly to dag  <cit> . in the gc-rich organism m. luteus, dimannosyl-dag is the lipid anchor of the essential lipomannan cell wall polymer  <cit> . therefore, temperature sensitive mutants defective in lipomannan assembly were isolated of m. luteus, and one of them  contained a reduced amount of dimannosyl-dag whereas the amount of monomannosyl-dag was increased  <cit> . the corresponding m. luteus gene encoding a putative gt is unknown; according to blast analysis, the gt encoded by mlut_ <dig> is a likely cpoa homologue.

in contrast to these organisms, the lta of s. pneumoniae is unique in that it includes choline and unusual sugar moieties in its repeating unit which is identical to that of the wall teichoic acid   <cit> . genetic evidence suggests strongly that the closely related species s. oralis and s. mitis contain similar ta molecules  <cit> . moreover, special choline-binding proteins are associated with the ta molecules, some of which are involved in crucial functions including cell separation , probably one of the reasons why lta and its biosynthetic enzymes are essential in s. pneumoniae.

early studies predicted the lta lipid anchor to be glcaatgalglcdag where aatgal is 2-acetamino-4-amino- <dig> ,6-trideoxy-d-galactose  <cit> , but recent data provide evidence that glcdag is the more likely anchor molecule  <cit> , i.e. the product of the reaction catalyzed by the gt spr <dig>  <cit> . failure to isolate deletions mutants in spr <dig> are in agreement with the essential nature of the s. pneumoniae lta. no effect on choline incorporation into the cell wall was noted in the piperacillin resistant mutants  <cit> , suggesting that teichoic acids seem to be present in similar amounts in mutant cells compared to r <dig> and that its biosynthesis is not affected by cpoa mutations. the estimated number of molecules for lta and glcdag is in the same range of magnitude. lta constitutes up to 20% of the lipid molecules in the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane in s. pneumoniae <cit> , and glycolipids represent 34% of the lipids in s. pneumoniae <cit>  with almost one third being glcdag  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here we have shown that cpoa acts as the glycosyltransferase in vivo responsible for the biosynthesis of the major glycolipid galglcdag in s. pneumoniae. the altered lipid composition of cpoa mutants - glcdag as the only glycolipid, and a higher proportion of phosphatidylglycerol relative to cardiolipin - affects many membrane related functions and thus results in a pleiotropic phenotype. the question remains why the selection of piperacillin-resistant laboratory mutants p <dig> and p <dig> resulted in the isolation of cpoa mutations. since cpoa was not affected in another six mutant families selected with cefotaxime, a beta-lactam that induces a tolerant response  <cit> , the cpoa mutations are probably related to the highly lytic action of piperacillin. changes of the physical properties of the membrane by alteration of the lipid composition might be an effective measure to counteract the lytic response induced by beta-lactams and other agents as well.
