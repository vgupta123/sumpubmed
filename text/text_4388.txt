BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, such as penicillins, first, second and third generation cephalosporines , tetracyclins and rifampicin. resistance is due to the low permeability of its membrane, the presence of efflux pumps and the production of ampc, a chromosomal β-lactamase  <cit> . furthermore, this pathogen has a notorious ability to acquire additional mechanisms of resistance including those based on efflux pump overexpression, porin loss, alteration of drug target or enzymatic modification of antibiotics. this phenomenon frequently gives rise to clinical isolates displaying a multidrug-resistant phenotype that delays the appropriate antibiotic treatment and leads to therapeutic failure  <cit> .

the ability of p. aeruginosa cells to form biofilms during infection greatly facilitates its persistence inside the host and contributes to antibiotic resistance  <cit> . biofilm formation first requires bacterial cell attachment to a surface followed by the development of a sessile colony with an extracellular matrix containing exopolysaccharide, proteins and nucleic acids. p. aeruginosa can form biofilms both in biotic  and abiotic surfaces . it is estimated that up to 65 % of bacterial infections are associated with the presence of biofilms . in addition, biofilms are extremely resistant to antibiotics and immune system effectors  <cit> . all these facts, underscore the importance of developing new therapies against biofilms formed by p. aeruginosa. ideally, new drugs should have multiple mechanisms of action and low susceptibility to the development of resistance, compared to conventional antibiotics.

the antibiotic resistance of biofilm-producing bacteria has been attributed to a diversity of factors including the permeability barrier conferred by the exopolysaccharide, the altered chemical microenvironment within the biofilm , the physiological heterogeneity of the bacterial population and the emergence of “persistent” cells  <cit> .

antimicrobial peptides  are produced by a wide variety of organisms as a first line of defense. their principal mechanism of action involves binding to conserved structural components of the bacterial envelope  followed by an interaction with the bacterial membrane that can be rapidly lethal. some amps also bind to intracellular targets and inhibit essential biological processes including cell wall formation or dna, rna and protein synthesis  <cit> . this mechanism of action is rapidly bactericidal and decreases the chances of resistance development compared to conventional antibiotics  <cit> .

the heterogeneity of bacteria embedded in the biofilm, a mixture of metabolically active and inactive cells, greatly reduces the efficiency of beta-lactams, which only kill actively dividing cells. in contrast, amps are bactericidal independently of the growing state of the target cell,  and this increases their appeal as potential anti-biofilm agents.

lactoferricin is an amp derived by pepsin digestion of lactoferrin, a multifunctional component of the innate immune system present in milk and other body fluids. lactoferricin displays antimicrobial activity against a wide variety of microorganisms  <cit> . using rational design, we devised a peptide library based on the sequence of lf <dig>  an 11-mer peptide derived from human lactoferricin, and determined the structural features governing the antimicrobial activity of the peptides against planktonic bacteria . in the present article, we test the efficacy of these compounds against biofilms formed by p. aeruginosa under static and dynamic growth regimes. in these assays, we include acyl-derivatives of the parental compounds to deduce the contribution of the acyl group to the anti-biofilm activity.

RESULTS
antimicrobial activity on planktonic p. aeruginosa cells
to assess the antimicrobial activity of the peptides and lipopeptides against planktonic p. aeruginosa susceptibility assays consisting of mic/mbc determination combined with killing kinetics studies were performed. compounds displayed a wide range of antimicrobial efficacy  with mics varying from  <dig> to 128 μg/ml. interestingly, except for two peptides, lf11- <dig> and lf11- <dig>  the rest of the compounds were bactericidal at their mic . as judged by mic value, the least potent antimicrobials were the two acylated derivatives of peptide lf11- <dig>  whereas a non-acylated compound, lf11- <dig>  showed the best mic.table  <dig> relevant characteristics of peptides and lipopeptides used in this study

in order to evaluate the bactericidal activity of the compounds, the kinetics of killing by each agent was measured at the following concentrations:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times its respective planktonic mic . table  <dig> shows the time required by each compound to decrease  <dig> logs the initial inoculum . these assays revealed the rapid kinetics of killing mediated by most of the compounds. notably, all peptides and lipopeptides except lf11- <dig> required less than 40 min at their mbc to reduce  <dig> log the initial inoculum. at  <dig> or 4×mic, most of the agents exhibited a very rapid killing, with t3log lower than 20 min. in accordance with these results, time-kill assays  demonstrated that acylation resulted in an enhanced bactericidal activity, since compounds killed significantly faster than their parental non-acylated counterparts when all were tested at their respective mbc.fig.  <dig> time-killing curves of peptides and lipopeptides at their mbc against p. aeruginosa pao <dig> strain. a lf11- <dig> and their n-acylated derivatives;  lf11- <dig> derivatives ;  lf11- <dig> and their n-acylated derivatives



compounds with the lowest mbc  did not correspond to those with the fastest killing kinetics. paradoxically, agents that killed most rapidly were those lipopeptides that had been found to have the poorest mics .

antimicrobial activity against p. aeruginosa biofilms
the anti-biofilm activity of the compounds was determined on biofilms grown under static or dynamic flow regimes. on biofilms grown in microplates , the disinfection and removal activities of the agents at 10xmic were determined by assays based on respiratory rate - <dig> -diphenyltetrazolium bromide), and biomass quantification , respectively. results of these experiments are summarized in fig. 2a. only lf11- <dig> and di-mb-lf11- <dig> showed a removal activity higher than 35 %. interestingly, two non-acylated compounds, lf11- <dig> and lf11- <dig>  were found to be the most potent bactericidal agents killing almost 100 % of the biofilm forming bacteria after 24 h of incubation. other peptides and lipopeptides  displayed a medium-range disinfection activity, whereas lf11- <dig> showed no anti-biofilm activity.fig.  <dig> effect of peptide treatment  on p. aeruginosa biofilms. biofilms were grown in  microtiter plates  and antibiofilm activities were determined by the mtt assay  and cv stain ;  cdc-reactor  and treated with  <dig> times the mic of the indicated compound for 24 h at 37 °c. live cells show green fluorescence due to gfp expression, whereas dead cells appear red because of the uptake of propidium iodide. sodium hypochlorite at 500 μg/ml was used as an antimicrobial positive control. scale bars = 20 μm. lf- <dig> treated biofilms were not selected for fluorescence analysis since no activity against biofilm in microplates assays was found



the antimicrobial activity of the compounds was also evaluated on p. aeruginosa biofilms grown under dynamic flow conditions by fluorescent microscopy. for this purpose, biofilms were grown on coupons in a cdc-reactor until reaching a bacterial density of  <dig>  log cfu/cm <dig> and then coupons were incubated during 60 min with 10xmic of the corresponding compound. viable cells of the strain used for these assays emit green fluorescence due to the expression of gfp . to better distinguish between dead and live cells, pi  was added to the samples. this dye only penetrates inside biofilms when cells are dead or damaged. when this occurs, pi interacts with dna, and cells emit red fluorescence. representative fluorescent micrographs of peptide and lipopeptide treated biofilms are shown in fig. 2b. despite the disparate methodologies and incubation times used for static and dynamically grown biofilm analysis , several compounds were identified as having potent anti-biofilm activity under both conditions including lf11- <dig>  lf11- <dig>  di-mb-lf11- <dig>  and lf11- <dig>  due to the significant removal activity displayed by lf11- <dig> and di-mb-lf11- <dig> , it is possible that the microscopic analysis had underestimated the bactericidal activity of these two agents. the only acylated compounds that rivaled the anti-biofilm activity of. lf11- <dig> and lf11- <dig> were di-mb-lf11- <dig> and di-mb-lf11- <dig>  interestingly, those two lipopeptides share the same acyl group . in striking contrast, the parental peptide lf11- <dig> displayed no anti-biofilm activity compared to their acylated derivatives.

after this preliminary screening, compounds with medium or high-range antimicrobial activity were selected to further characterize their activity against biofilms grown under dynamic conditions in the cdc-reactor. in these assays, mature biofilms were exposed to antimicrobials at different concentrations  and the bactericidal effect was quantified by viable cell count and by confocal laser scanning microscopy .

viable count analysis, summarized in fig.  <dig>  showed that the anti-biofilm activity of compounds increases in a concentration-dependent manner. overall, when tested on biofilms grown under dynamic conditions the antibacterial activity of the compounds was similar to that measured on statically cultured biofilms. lf11- <dig> and lf11- <dig> were the most potent peptides, since, when added at 10xmic, they were able to decrease more than  <dig> logs  the cell viability of biofilms in just 10 min. furthermore, both peptides caused a  <dig>  fold reduction in biofilm cell viability after 1 h of treatment at 10xmic.fig.  <dig> log reduction of cell viability in p. aeruginosa biofilm grown in cdc-reactor. concentrations used were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times the planktonic mic and biofilms were treated during  <dig> and 60 min. all experiments were performed in duplicate. anova-scheffé test was used to evaluate the statistical differences between the biofilm treated with the peptides and the untreated control incubated only with diluent buffer. *: p <  <dig> ; **: p <  <dig> ; and ***: p <  <dig> 



cytotoxicity of the compounds that displayed the best anti-biofilm activity was evaluated. lf- <dig>  lf11- <dig>  lf11- <dig> and its acyl derivative di-mb-lf11- <dig>  showed lc <dig> values higher than the maximum concentration assayed . on the contrary the lipopeptide di-mb-lf11- <dig> was more cytotoxic .

compared to lf11- <dig> and lf11- <dig>  the rest of the agents reduced viability to a lower extent and displayed a similar anti-biofilm activity regardless of the incubation time. the latter observation may reflect that these agents do not penetrate well inside the biofilm or that they display a rather slow killing mechanism on these structures.

to study these hypotheses, we treated biofilms with the selected compounds at 10xmic for 60 min and then quantified by clsm the percentage of viable  vs. dead  cells in the entire biofilm volume. as shown in fig.  <dig>  treatment with lf11- <dig> resulted in a uniform loss of viability in the whole biofilm structure . similar results were found with di-mb-lf11- <dig> , although an inner layer of viable cells was detected. compared to these two compounds, the rest of the peptides and lipopeptides displayed a lower anti-biofilm activity of similar magnitude . finally, biofilms treated with lf11- <dig> and di-mb-lf11- <dig> presented yellow cells. this phenomenon could be potentially explained by the existence of a cluster of permeabilized cells with reduced ability to exclude pi.fig.  <dig> bactericidal effect of peptides against p. aeruginosa biofilm grown in turbulent flow conditions . antimicrobial activity was observed with clsm. live cells emit green fluorescence  and dead cells appear red . these images show control biofilm  and treated biofilm for 1 h at  <dig> times the mic of peptides. the percentage shown in each image represented the percentage of dead cells . scale bars = 20 μm



discussion
in the present study, we have identified short cationic peptides and lipopeptides derived from human lactoferricin that display rapid antimicrobial activity against p. aeruginosa planktonic and biofilm-forming cells. some compounds penetrated deep into biofilm structures and killed homogenously even the inner layers of biofilm cells, as revealed by confocal microscopy analysis.

acylation enhanced the bactericidal activity of the parental peptides and resulted in lipopeptides that were uniformly bactericidal at their mic. the compound with the best inhibitory activity was peptide lf11- <dig> . interestingly, this antimicrobial activity did not vary when the compound was tested on the multiresistant p. aeruginosa clinical isolate ps <dig>  <cit> . our results show that the presence of proline  at the n-terminus of lf11- <dig> slightly improves peptide activity . similarly, the addition of another phenylalanine  to lf11- <dig>  greatly improves antimicrobial activity  with an 8-fold increase in mic . these observations correlate with those of zorko and collaborators, who analyzed the structure of peptide lf11- <dig> in lipidic environment  <cit> . according to these authors, the n-terminal residues p, f and w form an essential part of the peptide hydrophobic cluster, a region that upon insertion into the bacterial membrane determines the peptide ability to perturb the phospholipid bilayer.

the incorporation of an acyl group into the peptide structure resulted in a compound with improved inhibitory activity  only in the case of di-mb-lf11- <dig>  whereas the same acylation had a neutral impact on lf11- <dig> and lf11- <dig> activity. although some authors reported that the n-acylation of lf <dig> with a lauryl group results in a compound with increased antimicrobial activity , we cannot extend this conclusion to the acylated derivatives tested here in terms of inhibitory activity.. moreover, n-acylation enhances the binding to lipopolysaccharides of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria to different degrees, which can counteract membrane permeabilization by reducing the effective peptide concentration at the inner membrane . another explanation for this discrepancy could be the fact that we used a gram-negative organism in our assays. thus, it has been demonstrated  that although peptide acylation could not improve the antimicrobial efficacy on gram-negative organisms, it normally enhances this activity against gram-positive bacteria. in agreement with this observation, we demonstrated that 6-mo-lf11- <dig> displayed a mic eight times lower against s. aureus compared with its non-acylated counterpart, whereas such acylation did not improve antimicrobial activity against p. aeruginosa .

it is likely that other features related with the spatial location or conformation of the substituent, the amphipathicity of the resulting lipopeptide or its interfacial activity have a great impact on the antimicrobial activity, as shown by others . in addition, several authors reported that there is an optimum hydrophobicity window resulting in high antimicrobial activity and that any further increment or decline beyond that window dramatically decreases antimicrobial activity . similar observations were reported regarding the number of positive charges  <cit> .

our results indicate that not only the acyl chain of lipopeptides plays an important role in the antimicrobial activity, but also the amino acid sequence. time-kill assays performed with the  <dig> lipopeptides sharing identical acyl group  revealed major differences in kinetics with compound 6-mo-lf11- <dig> being the fastest acting of all . this agent has additional hydrophobic residues in its sequence  supporting the importance of hydrophobicity balance in antimicrobial activity, as discussed above.

several studies reported the efficacy of amps or peptidomimetics against fungal and bacterial biofilms including those formed by p. aeruginosa . although lactoferrin is able to inhibit biofilm formation  and several investigations evaluated the inhibitory effects of derivatives of lactoferrin against biofilm generated by gram-negative or gram-positive organisms , to the best of our knowledge there are no reports characterizing the antimicrobial activity of lactoferrin derived peptides against p. aeruginosa biofilms.

to be useful against mature biofilms, antimicrobials must possess either disinfection activity  or removal capacity. in assays on biofilms formed under static conditions , we identified several peptides and lipopeptides that decreased more than 50 % cell viability in comparison with non-treated biofilms, whereas one peptide, lf11- <dig>  was able to remove almost 60 % of the biofilm mass. it is possible that the high removal efficacy of this peptide  may have prevented the visualization of more dead cells in fluorescence micrographs of lf11- <dig> treated biofilms. this phenomenon could also explain why di-mb-lf11- <dig>  another compound with a significant anti-biofilm activity, had an apparently low anti-biofilm activity when assessed by microscopy. nevertheless, it is likely that the different methodologies used in those two types of assays, namely microplate  vs. cdc reactor  could explain the observed discrepancies in anti-biofilm activity.

assays performed with biofilm grown under dynamic conditions confirmed that lf11- <dig> and lf11- <dig> were the agents with the most potent bactericidal activity being able to reduce  <dig>  times the number of viable biofilm cells and displayed low cytotoxicity when tested at 10xmic. although those peptides have poor antimicrobial activity against planktonic cells , they exert very potent anti-biofilm activity at only  <dig> times their planktonic mic. apart from direct killing, these agents might operate by additional uncharacterized anti-biofilm mechanisms. thus, fuentes-nuñez and col. identified peptides that despite having high mics displayed good anti-biofilm activity. these compounds acted by inhibiting a cellular stress response or by dysregulating genes related with biofilm formation, supporting the notion that antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity should be separately evaluated  <cit> .

we also observed regardless of the biofilm model used, that acylation led to a partial loss of the peptide anti-biofilm activity in the case of lf11- <dig> and lf11- <dig> derivatives. interestingly, the lipopeptides that displayed the best activity against biofilms were di-mb-lf11- <dig> and di-mb-lf11- <dig>  that share the same acyl group , which were the smallest and among the least hydrophobic of the acylated compounds . compared to other lipopeptides, it is likely that  <dig> -dimethylbutanoyl bearing compounds could penetrate deeper into the biofilm matrix than the others. the low anti-biofilm efficacy of hydrophobic compounds could be due to their tendency to interact with eps components of p. aeruginosa biofilms. thus, high local concentrations of lipopeptides on eps matrix may promote their aggregation and hinder their penetration. this limitation could theoretically explain the similar anti-biofilm activity detected with the least active peptides  at  <dig> and  <dig> times their mic . among these peptides, di-mb-lf11- <dig> showed certain toxicity, but other anti-biofilm treatment such as antibiotic lock therapy could be an alternative, since antibiotics are not in contact with tissues or patients bloodstream.

moreover, lf11- <dig> treated biofilm showed the presence of yellow cells. this might indicate that although cell membranes are damaged, thus allowing the entry of pi, cells remain still alive and emit green fluorescence, explaining the yellow appearance. this permeabilizing effect was previously described by other authors using an unrelated peptide  <cit> , that was reported to be partially bactericidal. this fact together with previous studies by our group that demonstrated synergistic combination between lf11- <dig> or lf11- <dig> and antibiotics in planktonic cultures  <cit> , suggests that combination of lactoferricin derived peptides and antibiotics could enhance the efficacy of peptides as anti-biofilm agents  <cit> . the use of combinations of antimicrobials  as anti-biofilm therapy has already been successfully tested. this approach entailed not only the use of antimicrobials that target biofilm cells in different metabolic states  <cit>  but also the induction of antibiotic uptake due to the membrane disruption caused by another compound  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we identified peptides derived from human lactoferricin with potent antimicrobial activity against p. aeruginosa growing either in planktonic or in biofilm mode. in general, acylation of peptides increased the bactericidal activity against planktonic bacteria but reduced the anti-biofilm potency. peptides and some of the least hydrophobic lipopeptides were able to kill efficiently biofilm forming cells of p. aeruginosa and to penetrate deep into the innermost layers of the biofilm matrix. both peptides and lipopeptides displayed very rapid killing kinetics and all of them required less than 21 min to reduce  <dig>  times the viability of planktonic cells when tested at  <dig> times their mbc.

small and amphipathic cationic peptides are promising anti-biofilm agents, not only due to their broad activity spectrum, rapid mechanism of action and less susceptibility to resistance development, but also to their potential bactericidal activity against slow growing or even non-growing bacteria. further structure-activity relationship analyses are necessary to optimize the anti-biofilm activity of lipopeptides.
