BACKGROUND
craniofacial development begins when the cranial neural crest cells , which are migratory multipotent precursors, delaminate from the dorsal brain and migrate ventro-laterally to form the mesenchyme of facial primordia, known as the frontonasal prominence and pharyngeal arches  <cit> . the frontonasal prominence develops into the mid- and upper face, while the first pharyngeal arch turns into the lateral skull, most of the jaw, and part of the middle ear. the first pharyngeal arch is further divided into maxillary arch, which is the prospective upper jaw, and mandibular arch, which is the prospective lower jaw.

craniofacial abnormalities are relatively common birth defects in humans. for example, cleft palate affects  <dig> in ~ <dig> births, and it can lead to serious physical  and socio-psychological  problems  <cit> . the process of palate development is very conserved between humans and mice, and thus studies from the latter have contributed greatly to our understanding of normal and abnormal palatogenesis  <cit> . in mice, the primary palate forms from the fusion of the frontonasal prominence and maxillary arch at the rostral end of the face around embryonic day   <dig>  . on the other hand, the secondary palate develops more caudally from the medial side of the maxillary arch. the secondary palate first appears as a bilateral outgrowth of the palatal shelves on either side of the tongue at ~ e <dig> . subsequently, the palatal shelves elongate vertically, elevate themselves into a horizontal position above the tongue, grow toward each other, and fuse at the midline at ~ e <dig>  to complete the formation of the secondary palate. perturbation in any of these steps can lead to cleft palate, and a large number of genes are involved in the tight regulation of each step  <cit> .

ldb <dig>  encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein, found in organisms ranging from humans to nematodes  <cit> . ldb <dig> acts as an essential cofactor for various proteins, including lim-domain homeodomain transcription factors and lim-only  proteins  <cit> . in mice, ldb <dig> is ubiquitously expressed during development, and a global knockout of ldb <dig> caused mid-gestation lethality with severe defects, such as loss of the heart and anterior head  <cit> . in addition, tissue-specific deletions using a conditional knockout allele revealed that ldb <dig> is important in the development of the central nervous system , hematopoietic system, and limbs at later stages  <cit> .

to elucidate the potential role of ldb <dig> in craniofacial development, we generated a tissue-specific ldb <dig> mutant using wnt1-cre, which causes gene deletion in neural crest-derived cells  <cit> . we discovered that ldb <dig> plays an essential role in the morphogenesis of the secondary palate.

RESULTS
expression of ldb <dig> during craniofacial development
although ldb <dig> is broadly expressed during development, it is not expressed at the same level everywhere. therefore, we examined the expression of ldb <dig> during craniofacial development at e <dig>  - e <dig> , focusing on the developing palate. prior to the current study, the information on the facial expression of ldb <dig> was available only at e <dig>   <cit> . for rna in situ hybridization, we used an anti-sense probe against exons  <dig> through  <dig> of ldb <dig>  which are floxed in the conditional knockout allele  <cit> . we simultaneously performed in situ hybridization on the sections from control  and wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutant embryos. this strategy allowed us to distinguish low levels of ldb <dig> transcript from non-specific background , and to verify efficient inactivation of ldb <dig> in the facial mesenchyme by wnt1-cre.

at e <dig> , which is just before palate development begins, ldb <dig> was expressed broadly and strongly in the first pharyngeal arch mesenchyme in control embryos . the mesenchymal expression of ldb <dig> was moderately higher in the oral half  than in the aboral half, consistent with the positive regulation of ldb <dig> expression by fgf <dig> from the oral ectoderm  <cit> . contrary to the earlier report  <cit> , we also detected the expression of ldb <dig> in the epithelium of the first pharyngeal arch, although at a lower level than in the mesenchyme .

between e <dig>  and e <dig> , there was a reversal in the relative intensity of ldb <dig> expression in the mesenchyme compared with in the epithelium . at e <dig>  and e <dig> , the expression in the mesenchyme was barely detectable except in the condensed dental mesenchyme , whereas the expression in the epithelium, including the developing teeth, became more pronounced . throughout the stages examined, there was no obvious difference in the expression of ldb <dig> along the antero-posterior axis of the face .

we confirmed that wnt1-cre caused deletion of ldb <dig> in most of the facial mesenchyme, except in a small, scattered group of cells . this is consistent with the presence of mesoderm-derived cells in the mesenchyme  <cit> .

neural crest-specific inactivation of ldb <dig> leads to cleft secondary palate
we found that all of the wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants had fully cleft secondary palate at birth . skeletal preparations of the mutants showed no gross abnormality in the facial structures, apart from the defects in the maxilla and palatine bone associated with the cleft palate phenotype . consistent with the idea that the development of the face was not broadly affected in the wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants, they appeared indistinguishable from control embryos at e <dig> , with neural crest-derived cells showing normal distribution in all of the facial primordia .

ldb1-mutant palatal shelves have abnormal morphology and are impaired in reorientation
to determine which aspect of palatogenesis was disrupted in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants, we examined the morphology of the mutant palate at various stages. we examined three positions along the antero-posterior axis of the palate, because there is heterogeniety in the genetic regulation of palate development along this axis. we found that from e <dig> , the mutant palatal shelf had an abnormal shape in that it was more blunt and wider at the bottom compared with the controls ; this was more pronounced in the anterior and middle levels than in the posteior level . the size of the mutant palatal shelves, measured as the area on the sections, was not significantly different from the controls at e <dig>  . however, from e <dig> , the mutant palatal shelves were smaller than the controls in the anterior and posterior palate . in addition, the re-orientation of the palatal shelf was impaired in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants; at e <dig> , the anterior palate was elevated above the tongue in both controls and ldb <dig> mutants . however, the middle palate and the posterior palate remained vertical in the mutants at this stage . just before the birth , the mutant middle palate appeared to have initiated the re-orientation as indicated by the medial protrusion , which is considered an intermediate structure for palatal shelf elevation  <cit> . on the other hand, the posterior palate failed to elevate even at this late stage .

tissue sections also revealed that wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants had abnormal dentition, including loss of molars and appearance of diastema teeth on the upper jaw, and developmental arrest of lower molars. the details of the tooth phenotype will be described elsewhere.

defects intrinsic to the palate are responsible for failed elevation of ldb1-mutant posterior palate
multiple mouse mutants had been reported to have defects in palatal shelf elevation . one of the common causes of a failure in palatal shelf elevation is the interference by the tongue, when the tongue is not sufficiently depressed within the oral cavity. we noticed that the tongue of wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants was abnormally tall . therefore, we asked whether the defect in palatal shelf elevation was secondary to the tongue phenotype.

to answer this question, we dissected embryos at e <dig> , before the palatal shelves were elevated. we removed the tongue and the lower jaw from their heads, and cultured the heads rotating in a culture tube for  <dig> days. in all of the control embryos, one or both of the palatal shelves became horizontal throughout the antero-posterior axis after the culture . in contrast, in all of the ldb1-mutant embryos, both palatal shelves remained vertical in the middle and posterior domains . the mutant anterior palate was horizontal after the culture , which is consistent with the in vivo finding . hence, we concluded that the defect in middle/posterior palatal shelf elevation in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants is not due to the mechanical hindrance by the tongue.

localized abnormality in cell proliferation in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutant palatal shelves
since the palatal shelves of wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants were moderately smaller than the controls at e <dig>  , we asked whether a change in cell proliferation or cell death could explain this phenotype.

we labeled proliferating cells with bromodeoxyuridine  at e <dig> , performed immunofluorescence with anti-brdu antibody on sections, and calculated the percentage of mitotic cells in the palate mesenchyme . the sections of the palatal shelves were divided into medial and lateral areas , and the mitotic index was calculated for each area and for the total area . from the comparison between the controls and wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants, the only statistically significant difference  was found in the medial area of the anterior palate; this region showed reduced cell proliferation in the mutants . although the lateral area of the anterior palate had higher average mitotic index in the mutants than in controls, this difference was not statistically significant . when the total area of the palatal shelf was considered, there was no significant difference in cell proliferation at any position along the anterio-posterior axis . together, we conclude that the small decrease in the cell proliferation in the anterior-medial palate contributed to the hypoplasia of this region in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants .

we also stained the palate sections with an antibody against cleaved caspase- <dig>  to label apoptotic cells. there were very few dying cells in the palate mesenchyme of both controls and ldb <dig> mutants, and no difference was apparent between the genotypes .

expression of wnt5a, osr <dig> and pax <dig>  which regulate palatal shelf elevation, is altered in the ldb1-mutant palate
since ldb <dig> serves as a cofactor for multiple transcription factors, it is likely that ldb <dig> regulates the expression of other genes in the developing palate. therefore, we asked whether the inactivation of ldb <dig> leads to a change in the expression of genes important for palate development. in particular, we focused on the genes that are involved in reorientation of the palatal shelf, the process most affected in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants. wnt5a, osr <dig>  pax <dig> and zfhx1a have been implicated in palatal shelf elevation because the mutation of each gene in mice led to delay or failure in elevation  <cit> . pdgfra, expressed in the palatal mesenchyme, is also important in palatal shelf elevation as indicated by the delayed elevation in mouse mutants of pdgfc, encoding a ligand for pdgfra <cit> .

we found changes in the expression of wnt5a, osr <dig> and pax <dig> in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutant palate. wnt5a was shown to regulate cell migration in the palatal shelf; specifically, it attracted mesenchyeme cells  <cit> . during normal palatogenesis, wnt5a is expressed strongly in the anterior palate but minimally in the posterior palate at e <dig>  . however, in the ldb <dig> mutants, there was ectopic expression of wnt5a at the distal tip of the posterior palatal shelf . chemoattraction of the palatal mesenchyme cells toward this location could disrupt elevation of the palatal shelves . osr <dig> is normally expressed with asymmetric intensity in the anterior and middle palate, weaker on the nasal side and the distal tip of the palatal shelf , and stronger on the oral side . in the ldb <dig> mutants, osr <dig> expression was up-regulated in the distal tip of the anterior and middle palate . on the other hand, pax <dig> was down-regulated in the ldb <dig> mutants in the distal tip  and the nasal side of the middle palate . the expression patterns of zfhx1a and pdgfra were normal in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutant palate .

discussion
in this paper, we investigated the role of ldb <dig> in mammalian craniofacial development. ldb <dig> can bind to various proteins, including  <dig> lim-domain homeodomain transcription factors and  <dig> lim only  proteins in mammals, and is thought to act as a cofactor modulating the activities of these proteins  <cit> . although ldb <dig> was shown to play crucial roles in neuronal differentiation in the brain and spinal cord, erythropoiesis, and limb development  <cit> , its importance in craniofacial development had been unknown. we found that the function of ldb <dig> is essential for normal development of the secondary palate, in particular, for the reorientation of the palatal shelves.

the details of the molecular and cellular processes of palatal shelf elevation remain to be elucidated, but it is thought to involve two mechanisms: a rapid “swinging” of the palatal shelf from vertical to horizontal position is a favored model for the anterior palate, whereas tissue remodeling involving the “flow” of the cells from the ventral to the medial side of the palatal shelf is supported by histological studies in the posterior palate  <cit> . in case of wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants, the anterior palate elevated normally while the posterior palate failed to elevate, even though the anterior palate suffered from more severe growth deficiency than the posterior palate. therefore, our result supports the notion that two distinct mechanisms regulate the reorientation of the palatal shelf along the antero-posterior axis, and indicates that only the mechanism for the posterior palate was affected in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants.

palatal defects have been described in mouse mutants of more than  <dig> genes, and the delay or failure in palatal shelf elevation was noted in many of them  <cit> . inactivation of pdgfc, osr <dig>  pax <dig>  zfhx1a, and adamts <dig> caused a 1 ~  <dig> day delay in palatal shelf elevation, so did gain-of-function of fgfr <dig> and bmpr1a <cit> . on the other hand, inactivation of jag <dig>  fgf <dig>  spry <dig>  wnt5a, gsk3b, tbx <dig>  tak <dig> and fgfr <dig> led to failure in palatal shelf elevation, at least within the developmental stages examined in each study  <cit> . we found that the posterior palate of wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants remained vertical up to e <dig> , the last stage when we can collect the mutants because they die shortly after birth, and thus the phenotype was a failure rather than a delay of posterior palatal shelf elevation.

among the examples with failed elevation of palatal shelves, the mutants for jag <dig>  fgf <dig>  and tbx <dig> showed abnormal fusion between the palatal epithelium and oral or tongue epithelium, which likely contributed the defect  <cit> . in tak <dig> mutants, the palate defect was due to the mechanical hindrance by the malformed tongue  <cit> . in contrast, in the mutants of wnt5a, spry <dig>  gsk3b, and fgfr <dig>  the palatal elevation defect was attributed to changes intrinsic to the palatal shelves, including abnormal levels of cell proliferation and cell death  <cit> . furthermore, wnt5a mutation affected migration of the mesenchyme cells in the palatal shelf; he et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that there was directional migration of the cells in the developing palate, and that wnt5a acted as a chemoattractant for palatal mesenchyme cells.

in the current study, we ruled out the interference by the tongue as a cause of the palate defect in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants. we did not find evidence of aberrant adhesion between the ldb <dig> mutant palatal shelf and the tongue or oral epithelium. although there was a localized decrease in the cell proliferation in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutant palate, it was only found in the anterior palate, which did not exhibit reorientation defect. on the other hand, we did find ectopic expression of wnt5a at the distal tip of the posterior palatal shelf in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants. this ectopic wnt5a could pull the palatal mesenchyme cells toward the distal end of the palatal shelf, preventing the cells from “flowing” to the medial side, which is thought to be integral to the reorientation of the palatal shelves in the posterior domain. further experiments are necessary to test this hypothesis.

the up-regulation of osr <dig> and down-regulation of pax <dig> could also contribute to the palatal defect of the ldb <dig> mutants. however, the changes in osr <dig> and pax <dig> expression were more pronounced in the middle palate than in the posterior palate, and thus did not correlate with the relative severities of the elevation defect. furthermore, while the morphologies of the anterior and middle palate are very similar between pax9
−/−
 mutants and wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants   <cit> , the phenotypes differ in the posterior palate. in pax9
−/−
 mutants, the posterior palate became horizontal by e <dig> , indicating that there is a delay but not a failure in palatal elevation  <cit> . also, pax9
−/−
 mutants showed a significant decrease in cell proliferation in the posterior palate at e <dig> , and consequently, suffered from much more severe hypoplasia of this region than wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants at e <dig>   <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the delay in palatal elevation in pax9
−/−
 mutants is secondary to growth deficiency, whereas in wnt1-cre;ldb1
fl/-
 mutants, the process of palatal elevation is directly affected.

among the lim domain proteins, lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> play important roles in the development of the secondary palate, and thus they are the most likely partners of ldb <dig> for its role in palatogenesis. mutation of lhx <dig> in mice resulted in cleft secondary palate with partial penetrance, in which the horizontal growth and/or fusion of the palatal shelves were affected  <cit> . although inactivation of lhx <dig> did not cause overt palatal defects  <cit> , simultaneous inactivation of lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> resulted in fully penetrant cleft palate, indicating that the two genes have overlapping functions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we established that ldb <dig> in the facial mesenchyme is essential for normal development of the secondary palate. inactivation of ldb <dig> resulted in changes intrinsic to the palatal shelves that led to the failure in reorientation of the posterior palate. in addition, our results suggest that ldb <dig> is involved in regulating the expression of wnt5a, osr <dig> and pax <dig> in the palate, genes that have been implicated in palatal shelf elevation.
