BACKGROUND
computational analysis of the genomes in combination with large-scale expression studies becomes increasingly important for detailed functional annotation of the eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. analysis of regulatory regions of protein-coding genes is an important aspect of functional annotation. the most frequently used approach to the study of the regulatory regions of genes relies on search of the so-called transcriptional regulatory modules. these modules are the gene regions enriched in the binding sites  for a set of particular transcription factors . the underlying idea is that a specific transcription of a particular group of genes is regulated by multiple interactions of a set of tfs. at present, several methods for the identification of the transcriptional regulatory modules are available. these include, for example, modulesearcher and modulescanner  <cit> , confac  <cit> , mscan  <cit> , composite module analyst  <cit> .

a biomedically important aspect of the functional annotation of the human genome is the identification of the interferon -controlled genes. the ifns are cytokines that possess diverse biological properties. ifns of the type i, ifns-α and ifn-β activate cells of the immune system and modulate cell differentiation  <cit> . the ifn of the type ii, ifn-γ, is important for the development of antibacterial and antiparasitic immune responses  <cit> . it has been also shown that it is involved in the development of some autoimmune diseases  <cit> . the interaction of the ifns with cell surface receptors activates the jak-stat signal transduction pathway resulting in the activation of the tfs isgf <dig>  and stat <dig>   <cit> . some members of the irf family of tfs  <cit>  are also critical for functioning of the ifn system  <cit> . these irfs regulate the cell cycle; they also affect antigen presentation and production of nitric oxide  <cit> . interactions of the isgf <dig>  stat <dig>  and irfs with their bss in the regulatory regions of the ifn-stimulated genes  enhance their transcription.

despite the long-standing studies of the ifn system, the intricate mechanisms of its function and the contribution of individual isgs to the development of the immune response remain unclear in many aspects. moreover, by far not all the isgs have been identified as yet. in particular, support for this comes from the discrepancy between the reported estimates of the isg number in the human genome, more than  <dig>  <cit> , and the dozens well studied.

the goal of this study was to reveal the transcriptional regulatory modules that are most specific to the isgs of three types: the arbitrary ifn-inducible genes , the genes induced by the type i ifns, and the genes stimulated by the type ii ifns. we chose a way different from the currently used approaches, which are based on universal descriptors applicable to diverse gene families. mscan  <cit>  and composite module analyst  <cit>  are good examples of bioinformatics tools that use such methods. we abandoned universality for a more detailed analysis of ifn-stimulated genes through identification of their most specific bs patterns. instead of the sophisticated methods for a universal description of the transcriptional regulatory modules, we preferred relatively simple recognition methods adapted for analysis of specific classes of ifn-inducible modules. the improved detection of the potential isgs by the computer-assisted approaches might provide a better understanding of their underlying mechanisms and side effects of the popular ifn therapy.

RESULTS
distribution of the irf <dig>  isgf <dig>  stat <dig>  and nf-κb binding sites in the isg sequences
we developed methods for the recognition of the  <dig> bss including bss for tf irf <dig>  isgf <dig>  stat <dig>  and nf-κb, the key regulators of the ifn system. for each bs type, we included all available experimentally verified sites. each sample contained at least  <dig> bss. to develop the methods, we chose only those site types that are known to have the strongest effects at the transcription level of isgs. using the developed methods , the localization patterns of the putative bss in the regions spanning from - <dig> to + <dig> bp with respect to the tss in the training sample of the isgs  were analyzed . it is generally accepted that the promoter regions are enriched in bss for various tfs. for irf <dig>  isgf <dig>  and stat <dig>  the density of the putative bss in the region from - <dig> to + <dig> bp with respect to the tss is twofold higher than in the rest of the region. in this region, the putative bss for irf <dig> and isgf <dig> were present in the majority of genes  and stat <dig> bss were detected in 20% of the genes. by contrast, no considerable increase in the density was observed in the region near the tss for the putative nf-κb bss. in recognition of the putative bss here and further, in addition to the common threshold, we used the additional threshold values a2* needed for statistical simulation . they were adapted in a way to maximally reduce the number of false positives by omitting not more than half of the actual sites of the training samples. stating it otherwise, reliability of the predicted sites was provided by reasonable omission of actual, but weak, sites.


it should be noted that the experimentally confirmed bss for irf <dig>  isgf <dig>  and stat <dig> were identified in 39%, 29%, and 13% of these genes, respectively . this disagreement between the number of the putative and experimentally confirmed bss suggested that a substantial fraction of these genes have been poorly studied, thus many of their bss remain unknown. this applies not only to the isgs, novel bss are increasingly revealed in the regulatory regions of many genes. a number of undetected bss may be especially large for regulatory regions located in great distances from the tsss. to confirm this, we refer to the results of chip-chip data  <cit>  analysis. it has been found that only 15% of the experimentally detected bss for tf myc are at a distance of < <dig> bp from the tss, 33% at < <dig> bp, and 49% are by more than  <dig> bp away from the tss. however, the bss for myc stored in transfac are differently located relative to the tss, namely 56% of the bss are at a distance of < <dig> bp from the tss, 67% are at < <dig> bp, and none is further away than  <dig> bp from it. a similar distance distribution was observed for the myc bss stored in trrd. thus, in terms of the experimentally verified myc bss from the transfac and trrd databases, the site location near the tss prevails. by contrast, in terms of the chip-chip experiments, there is no such prevalence. the reason for the discrepancy is not the poor annotation of the bss in the transfac or trrd databases. the reason is that many genes are still insufficiently studied. as a rule, until recently, researchers focused their attention on the promoter regions, and the regions far beyond tsss that contain the functional sites were often left unnoticed.

in general, presence of unknown remote regulatory regions might cause substantial problems for computational analyses. however, our study of the isg promoters demonstrated that the vast majority of bss are located near tsss. to delineate the structural features of isgs, the regulatory regions of  <dig> functional groups of genes were compared. the gene regions spanning from - <dig> to + <dig> bp with respect to the tsss were examined;  <dig> random human promoters from the epd  were used as a control. there was a severalfold density excess of the putative bss for the irf <dig>  isgf <dig>  and stat <dig> in the  region of isgs , whereas the density excess was less pronounced in some other regions . for this reason, we further analyzed the  region that was found to be important in determination of the specificity of the isg regulatory regions. omission of the sites included in the training samples for site recognition did not affect the distribution feature . differences between the training-isg set and the other gene groups are shown in table  <dig> 

*bss used for drawing training samples for site recognition were omitted

correct regulation of the gene expression is provided not only by the presence of bss of particular types, it also requires specific localization of bss with respect to tsss and each other. in the detection of the characteristic features of the bs localization in isgs, not only the key regulators, but also their possible interactions with the other regulators must be taken into account. in addition to the distribution of the main regulators , we checked the distribution of the putative bss for another  <dig> tfs, namely, ap <dig>  c/ebp, e2f, gata <dig>  gr, hnf <dig>  hnf <dig>  hnf <dig>  myod, nf-y, oct <dig>  sf <dig>  sp <dig>  and tata-box. only a few bss  showed the higher density specific to the isgs in the region of interest. next, we turned to analysis of the frequencies of the sites for the main regulators and these tfs. about  <dig> hundreds of various site combinations were examined. emphasis was on the combinations of the putative bss of the key regulators and also their combinations with the sites of the other types. of these,  <dig> combinations whose occurrence frequencies in the training-isg set were significantly different from these in the control sets were selected. most bs pairs were composed of combinations involving bss of the key regulators, including their tandem repeats. taking advantage of individual sites, their combinations and information about the type and level of induction of each gene of the training-isg set, we developed  <dig> methods for the recognition of the ifn-inducible regions in dna. in order to do this, we compiled two subsamples from the training-isg set; the genes mainly induced by the ifnstypei  were assigned to the first subsample and those by the ifnγ to the second subsample . the recognition methods for the ifn-inducible regions were as follows:

i. method  <dig>  any ifn-inducible region ;

ii. method  <dig>  promoter or regulatory region inducible by type i ifns ;

iii. method  <dig>  promoter or regulatory region of the type ii ifn  -inducible genes.

each method was based on the patterns obtained by comparison of the respective training-isg set and subsets  <dig>  with the control-epd set. the patterns selected for each method are given in tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the resulting patterns were the individual sites with defined disposition relative to tss or a combination of two sites. individual sites were identified using the asymptotical statistical test for comparison of two binomial variables. site pairs were selected using the standard χ <dig> test based on the  <dig> × 2-contingency tables .

dashes in the second columns of tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> indicate the individual sites. the weight of each pattern, w = f1/f <dig>  is next to it. the weight indicates how many times more frequently the pattern occurs in the training-isg set compared to the control-epd set. tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contain all the selected patterns whose occurrence frequencies in the training-isg set significantly exceed those in the control-epd set.

to check how the methods work, information from  <dig> articles on the isgs identified by microarrays  was assessed. based on this information, we compiled a sample of the promoter regions of  <dig> isgs . however, the information about the type and extent of ifn induction for some of the genes was incomplete. for this reason, two subsamples, microarray-isg subset  <dig> and microarray-isg subset  <dig>  were derived from microarray-isg set. the microarray-isg subset  <dig> contained only gene sequences whose induction by the type i ifns  was more than twofold during the first  <dig> hours of ifn stimulation. thus, most genes whose induction by ifns might have been caused indirectly and also the "weak" isgs were ignored. this made the microarray-isg subset  <dig>  contain less falsely included genes than the microarray-isg set. the microarray-isg subset  <dig> was composed of the sequences of the genes induced by the type ii ifn; the restrictions imposed on their inclusion for the microarray-isg subset  <dig> were the same as for the microarray-isg subset  <dig>  since there were much less data for the fold induction by the ifnγ than for the type i ifns, microarray-isg subset  <dig> ultimately contained  <dig> genes versus the  <dig> genes in the microarray-isg subset  <dig> 

what if the microarray-isg set contained some "weak" isgs and/or falsely included genes? this may be the case because only  <dig> % of the genes were recognized . by contrast, in the microarray-isg subset  <dig> and microarray-isg subset  <dig>  recognition was much better and comparable to that in the training-isg-set for both the short and long sequences. this result suggested that the microarray-isg subset  <dig> and the microarray-isg subset  <dig> were quite homogenous and representative.

at restricted sequence length, the recognition was poorer because the ifn-inducible enhancers could be far away from tsss. isgs containing enhancers at the distance of ~ <dig> bp upstream of tsss were not recognizable after sequences were truncated.

using the developed methods at various threshold levels, dna sequences from - <dig> to + <dig> bp with respect to the tss from gene groups were analyzed. the dependence of recognition on the function threshold value is graphically represented in fig.  <dig>  method  <dig> outperformed the other two: it recognized the regions responsive to any ifn where, even at the maximum cut-off , about 1% of the genes were recognized in the epd and refseq samples, but recognition remained high, at  <dig> %, in the training-isg set . method  <dig>  performed quite similarly. method  <dig>  requires improvement because of a high overprediction .

search of the potential isgs in the human genome
to minimize the overpredictions admitted in the search of the potential isgs in the human genome, we applied together all the three methods. this enabled us to detect with high significance the early response isgs with a several fold enhancement of the expression in the response to ifns. to determine the number of early response isgs in the human genome, we used the epd database  <cit>  because it contains well-documented tsss. the - <dig> to + <dig> bp regions of the  <dig> human genes annotated in the epd database were analyzed. the training and control sets were analyzed in the same way. the recognition performance for the isgs in the various samples is set out in table  <dig> 

among the  <dig> human genes retrieved from epd,  <dig> that potentially responded to the ifn induction were recognized . for  <dig> of these, ifn induction had not been detected. for the  <dig> other genes, rna microarray analyses provided experimental support for transcription enhancement by ifn. in  <dig> of the recognized genes, the - <dig> to + <dig> bp promoter regions were the most sensitive to ifn induction.

the detected potential isgs may be grouped by the ifn biological activities. these groups include immune and inflammatory responses, regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, antitumor effect . genes whose involvement in biological functions of ifns was doubtful were regarded as possible overestimations and they were all assigned to the possible false-positives.

the regulatory regions of the genes of the ifn system have been systematically studied for many years. as a consequence, the number of isgs with well-annotated tsss may be relatively high and epd-set is more enriched in these genes than the refseq-set. thus, our estimates of the isg number in the human genome may turn out to be much higher than the epd-based. given the fact that not all tsss are well-annotated in the refseq, higher underpredictions in refseq-based datasets may be expected because our isg recognition was strongly dependent on the accuracy of tss detection.

according to our estimates based on epd and given the possible overprediction , the human genome contains about  <dig> isgs. however, the refseq-based estimates are more than threefold smaller . it is likely that the real number lies somewhere between these two numbers, i.e. from  <dig> to  <dig> isgs per human genome. this estimate agrees with the one determined using microarrays. in the primary monocytes from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from hcv infected patients at least twofold induction during the first  <dig> hours after ifnα treatment was observed for  <dig> genes  <cit> , whereas the number of ifnγ-inducible genes was  <dig> in macrophages  <cit> . our results obtained by method  <dig> are consistent with the prediction results for the ifnγ-inducible genes: 65% of the predicted genes were, indeed, ifnγ-inducible;  <dig> genes out of  <dig>  genes were predicted as ifnγ-inducible  <cit> . in the hepg <dig> cell line,  <dig> genes of  <dig>  analyzed genes were induced more than twofold by ifnα and  <dig> by ifnγ  <cit> . in the ht <dig> fibrocarcinoma cell line, over  <dig> of  <dig>  genes were inducible by the type i ifns during the first  <dig> hours of induction, however, a less than twofold induction was observed for 75% of them  <cit> . the gene sets inducible by different ifns and in cells of different types do not overlap entirely. out of  <dig> genes examined in ifn-treated hela, hepatoma cell lines and primary embryonic hepatocytes,  <dig> were consistently ifn-inducible, by contrast, the ifn stimulation of another  <dig> genes was cell-type specific  <cit> .

we believe that further experimental and computational studies will provide a better understanding of the genes involved in ifn induction and ultimately of the molecular mechanisms of this induction, thereby more precise prediction of the side effects of ifn therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig>  approaches for the recognition of the  <dig> bss including bss for the key regulators of the ifn system, namely, irf <dig>  isgf <dig>  stat <dig>  and nf-κb were developed.

 <dig>  specific combinations of various bss were revealed for the ifn-inducible regions of the three analyzed types.

 <dig>  to provide more efficient tools for isg recognition, we devised three computer-assisted methods for the prediction of the ifn-inducible regions relying on the increase in the occurrence frequency of bs combinations in the 5'-regions of isgs.

 <dig>  about  <dig> genes were confidently predicted as isgs out of  <dig>  gene sequences from in the refseq, epd, and trrd databases.
