BACKGROUND

cucurbita pepo l. is an economically important species of the cucurbitaceae family cultivated worldwide, with more than  <dig> million tons produced in  <dig> and nearly  <dig>  million ha cultivated  <cit> . it is particularly important in asian, american and mediterranean countries, being mexico and spain the main worldwide exporters. like other cucurbits, c. pepo has become a model to study sex expression, fruit set and development, and parthenocarphy  <cit> .

taxonomically, the species is divided into three subspecies, c. pepo ssp. pepo l., c. pepo ssp. ovifera  decker  filov), both of them including cultivated varieties, and c. pepo ssp. fraterna  lira, andres & nee that is considered as a true wild subspecies  <cit> . the domestication occurred at least twice in southern usa and northern mexico, where the cultivar diversification was initiated. an additional diversification process occurred after the european contact with the new world and the subsequent migration mainly to mediterranean countries. nowadays, this species displays a high variability for many agronomic traits, such as fruit shape and color, flowering habit, leaf morphology, etc.  <cit> .

cultivars are classified in eight horticultural groups . the “zucchini” group rank among the highest-valued vegetables worldwide  <cit> . cultivars from zucchini, vegetable marrow and cocozelle groups, all of them producing elongated fruits, are considered as modern cultivars being newly developed in europe, whereas the round and flattened pumpkins and scallops are ancient groups developed after domestication in north america  <cit> .

despite the agricultural and biological interest of this species, knowledge of its genetics and genome has been very limited in comparison with other cucurbits . recently, we produced the first transcriptome of the species, from root, leaves, and flower tissues, by using the  <dig> sequencing technology  <cit>  that was later significantly improved with illumina technology by sequencing cdna from additional tissues . the c. pepo transcriptome v <dig> is available at the cucurbigene website  <cit> . genes were annotated and classified in different biological functions. some of them have been recently used to study biological processes in cucurbita  <cit> .

the transcriptome sequencing was focused on two varieties with contrasting phenotypes, representing the two c. pepo main subspecies, the inbreeding line ‘mu-cu-16’, belonging to the zucchini morphotype , the main summer squash sold in european markets, and the inbreeding line ‘upv-196’ of the scallop morphotype . these genotypes also represent different domestication and diversification steps, scallop types were already selected by native americans, whereas elongated zucchini were selected in italy after the introduction of this species in europe  <cit> . recently, other transcriptomic studies have been carried out with specific purposes, for instance, to identify genes involved in aphid infestation  <cit> , or to develop markers in pumpkin types  <cit> .

dense genetic maps are necessary tools for efficient molecular breeding. in the past decades, the linkage maps of the cucurbita genus were constructed using populations derived from both inter  and intra-specific crosses . these maps were first composed of dominant markers  and amplified fragment length polymorphisms ) , and later completed with ssrs  <cit> . the two genotypes, zucchini and scallop, used to generate the c. pepo transcriptome were also selected previously as parents of an f <dig> mapping population that was employed to construct the first snp-based genetic map of the species and to map several qtls  involved in plant, flowering and fruit traits  <cit> .

the snps located in the map by esteras et al.  <cit>  were selected among those identified in silico by mining the transcriptomic sequences of the f <dig> parents , and were validated using a golden-gate genotyping platform. despite this map produced valuable information, its marker density was only moderate . new methods integrating simultaneously snp discovery and genotyping such as genotyping-by-sequencing   <cit>  can be applied to rapidly develop high-density genetic maps.

the aim of this work is to generate a high-density genetic map using several thousands of snps obtained by the gbs analysis of a new recombinant inbred line population , developed through single seed descent from the previous zucchini x scallop f <dig> population  <cit> . ril populations are more adequate for genetic mapping as a higher number of recombinations are produced, improving the mapping resolution, and they can be replicated by seed, making easy replicated trials that facilitates a better estimation of qtl effects  <cit> . consequently, we also investigated the genetic control of economically important traits as vine, flowering and fruit quality traits, by qtl analysis, taking advantage of the new high-density map and of the first draft of the c. pepo genome available at the cucurbigene website  <cit> . the results presented herein will help to establish a molecular breeding system in this species.

methods
generation of the ril population
two genotypes of c. pepo were used as parentals to produce the intra-specific ril mapping population used in this study, belonging to different subspecies, ‘mu-cu-16’ is a zucchini type of the subspecies pepo and ‘upv-196’ is a scallop type of the subspecies ovifera. the two parents present contrasting phenotypes for vine, flowering and fruit traits detailed in  <cit> . f <dig> plants produced from the zucchini x scallop cross were selfed to generate the f <dig> population used to construct the first snp-based map in c. pepo  <cit> . f <dig> individual plants were selfed until the f <dig> generation by single seed descent. a final set of 120 f <dig> rils was obtained.

dna isolation
dna was isolated from young leaves of plants of each of the  <dig> rils. additionally, three replicated samples of parentals and the f <dig> generation and two independent dna extractions of two randomly selected ril families were included as controls. dna extraction was carried out using dneasy plant mini kit . dna concentrations were measured with nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer v. <dig>  to select samples with at least 50 ng/μl. finally,  <dig> samples with high-quality dna were selected for sequencing. samples were sent for genotyping to the genomic diversity facility at cornell university . a minimum of 500 ng of dna were used for snp genotyping.

genotyping-by-sequencing
a genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used for snp discovery between the parents and among the rils as described by elshire et al.  <cit> . the gbs libraries from all samples were prepared using apeki endonuclease  and sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform . gbs libraries were constructed including the parents and f <dig>  and  <dig> ril samples. gbs sequencing reads were de-multiplexed according to the sample barcodes and adapter sequences were removed using gbs barcode splitter  <cit> . reads were trimmed by base phred quality  and reads shorter than  <dig> base pairs were discarded before mapping and snp calling.

the filtered, high-quality sequences from each sample were aligned to the last version of the c. pepo genome v. <dig>   <cit>  using bowtie  <dig> with default parameters  <cit> . snp calling was performed using freebayes  <cit> . a minimum mapping quality of  <dig>  minimum base quality of  <dig> and minimum coverage of  <dig> was required. resulting snps were additionally filtered discarding those with more than 70% of missing data, no biallelic, with a minimum allele frequency < 10%, or with heterozygosity >70%. genotypes with a quality lower than  <dig> were also discarded.

phenotyping of the ril population
the seeds of 120 f <dig> rils were germinated in petri dishes and transplanted to pots  and to soil  at 2 weeks after germination in three independent assays. the first assay was performed from february to july  <dig>  at the tunnel facilities of cajamar . three plants per ril were phenotyped. dna for gbs analysis was obtained from this trial. the other two assays were conducted in  <dig>  at the same tunnel facilities  and in the glasshouse facilities at the polytechnic university of valencia  . in these two assays, also three sister plants were phenotyped per ril with a fully randomized experimental design.

in the three assays we measured traits related to vine growth, plant morphology, flowering and fruit traits. forty-three traits were measured for each single plant . vine traits were related to plant length , branching intensity, and leaf traits ; and flowering traits were related to the flowering time .

each plant was selfed and two fruits per plant were analyzed. one of them at immature stage, 7 days after pollination, which corresponds to the commercial stage of summer squashes. the second fruit was analyzed at physiological maturity . traits measured at both physiological states were immature/mature peduncle length, fruit size and shape , flesh firmness, rind and flesh color, and sugar content and acidity. more details about all measured traits are included in additional file  <dig> 

data from the assays performed in the three locations were used to calculate pairwise genetic correlations between locations as r x,y = covariance x,y/√, where x and y represented two different locations  <cit> .

genetic map construction and qtl detection
a genetic map was constructed using r packages r/qtl  <cit>  and asmap  <cit> . asmap package implements the mstmap algorithm  <cit> , which is an extremely fast algorithm for linkage map clustering and ordering of thousands of markers. snps were coded as homozygotes similar to one parent , to the other  or heterozygotes  using custom scripts. polymorphic loci that were heterozygous in any of the parents, markers with more than 10% of missing data or duplicated markers  were discarded. to remove possible genotyping errors, we used our own implementation of the smooth algorithm  <cit> . this method corrects the genotype of an individual based on neighboring markers. mstmap function from asmap package was used to cluster and order markers and quickest to estimate genetic map distances using kosambi map function  <cit> . to detect segregation distortion, chi-square  tests were computed for each snp using r/qtl function geno.table and p-values were corrected for multiple testing using benjamini and yekutieli correction  <cit> . highly distorted and unlinked markers were excluded from analysis. mapchart  <dig>   <cit>  was used to visualize a constructed map for each linkage group . the new map was compared with the previous c. pepo 384-snp map developed with the f <dig> population derived from the same zucchini x scallop cross  <cit> . this set of snps were located in the c. pepo genome v. <dig>  using blast with their flanking sequences in order to obtain an equivalence between esteras’ genetic map and current genome version. linkage groups were named according to the ril map generated in the current study.

once the genetic map was established, snps showing segregation distortion were located in the physical map together with the mapped snps to identify genomic regions with genetic distortion.

qtl mapping
qtl analysis for each trait was performed by composite interval mapping  using the r/qtl function cim with a scan window size of 20 cm and  <dig> background marker loci as qtl cofactors. a multi environment search of qtls was performed using the data from the three assays. environmental effects and genotype x environment  interactions were estimated for each trait using a two factor analysis of variance , with all the phenotypic data. also an additional qtl analysis was performed per environment, using data of each assay separately. logarithm of odds  threshold for a type i error p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  value was obtained based on a permutation test . lod support interval was calculated using r/qtl lodint function using a  <dig>  lod units drop. the additive qtl effect  and the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by qtl  were estimated at the highest qtl peaks using r/qtl function fitqtl. qtls exceeding the threshold value  in this analysis were considered significant.

RESULTS
sequence data and snp discovery
a total of  <dig>  million cleaned reads with a total of  <dig>  gb were generated for the parents, f <dig> and the  <dig> ril samples. the number of reads obtained varied from  <dig>  million to  <dig>  million with an average of  <dig>  million reads per line. the genome of c. pepo v <dig>  has a total assembled size of  <dig> ,453 bp . all the cleaned reads represent an average percentage of covered genome with a read depth >  <dig> and >  <dig> of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . sequences have been submitted to the sequence read archive  of the ncbi .

the sequences obtained were filtered and used for snp identification. a  <dig> % of the cleaned reads were mapped to the c. pepo genome and  <dig>  snps were identified after the snp calling with freebayes. after excluding snps that were monomorphic in the ril population, those non biallelic, with more than 70% of missing data, with heterozygosity >70% or with minimum allele frequency  < 10%,  <dig>  snps remained. the snps identified were again filtered to remove heterozygous snps in parents.

the number of snps identified in this population is higher than the number identified in a recent gbs analysis performed using an f <dig> population derived from the cross between two accessions of the closely related species cucurbita maxima  <cit> . using the same filters employed in the study by zhang et al.  <cit> , that is, selecting snps with less than 20% missing data and maf ≥  <dig> , we identified about eight times more snps in our ril population,  <dig>  snps in c. pepo ril population versus  <dig>  in c. maxima population. differences can be explained by the higher variability of the c. pepo species and by the fact that we have crossed two accessions belonging to two different subspecies generated in two independent domestication events  <cit> .

construction of genetic map
a genetic map was constructed using genotypic data of the ril population. after discarding those snps with more than 10% of missing data, and those showing a statistically significant deviation from mendelian segregation,  <dig>  snps distributed in  <dig> scaffolds  remained. we found  <dig>  snps forming groups of snps with the same genotype for all samples. only one snp per group was retained. we also removed unlinked markers and snps that had different genotypes in the two dna replicates used as controls. the average degree of heterozygosity existing in this f <dig> ril population was  <dig> % .

the map consisted of  <dig>  snps distributed across  <dig> linkage groups . the individual lgs had between  <dig> and  <dig> markers each, with a mean of  <dig>  markers per lg. the lg size ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , giving a total genetic length of  <dig> .6 cm. average genetic distance between successive markers was  <dig>  cm, and maximum spacing between markers ranged from  <dig>  cm in lg  <dig> to  <dig>  cm in lg  <dig>  a total of  <dig> scaffolds  of the current version of the c. pepo genome  could be anchored to the genetic map . additional file  <dig>  includes detailed information about the genetic map with the genetic and the physical position of each snp marker in the c. pepo genome , along with the flanking sequences of all snps. all snps have unique physical locations in the c. pepo genome, and are potentially transferable among species allowing comparative studies within this genus.table  <dig> genetic map of a ril population of c. pepo


for each linkage group, number of markers, total genetic distance, average and maximum spacing between adjacent markers is shown. number of scaffolds of the c. pepo genome v. <dig>  included in each linkage group is also shown


fig.  <dig> correspondence between ril and f <dig> maps. correspondence between the  <dig> linkage groups of the new map developed with gbs using the ril population  and the  <dig> linkage groups of the previous map constructed with the f <dig> population derived from the same cross . snp markers common to both maps are indicated 




this new map significantly improves the previously reported c. pepo map constructed with the f <dig> population in the earlier study by esteras et al.  <cit> , which included  <dig> markers covering  <dig> .8 cm, with an average distance between markers of  <dig>  cm and a maximum gap of  <dig>  cm. the sequences of these markers were mapped to the c. pepo genome to compare both maps. it was possible to associate most of the linkage groups established in the f <dig> map, with unique lg of the new high density genetic map . the ril map enabled merging former lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> . also current lg  <dig> and  <dig> corresponded with the former lg  <dig>  therefore, the comparison of both maps revealed  <dig> linkage groups that corresponded to the  <dig> chromosomes of c. pepo.

the map length is similar to that reported for c. maxima,  <dig> .8 cm  <cit> , with a much higher marker density,  <dig>  versus  <dig>  marker per lg, an average of  <dig>  versus  <dig>  cm between successive markers, and fewer genetic gaps, making the current map the most saturated genetic map of the cucurbita genus to date.

snps with statistically significant distorted segregation that were discarded for map construction, were located in the genome . in some regions, distorted snps were interspersed with non-distorted snps, so the observed distortion was not likely due to genetic reasons, but to artefacts of the gbs analysis or complex genomic causes . however, in other regions, blocks of continuous distorted snps were observed. in such cases, a real genetic distortion was assumed . these regions were mainly located in the distal region of lg  <dig>  and of lg  <dig> and lg  <dig> . this distortion in the distal region of lg  <dig> could explain why this lg could not be merged with lg  <dig> in the rils map . other regions with distorted segregation were for example in lg  <dig> , lg  <dig> , lg  <dig>  and lg  <dig> , with scallop alleles overrepresented, and in lg  <dig> , with zucchini alleles overrepresented. also some scaffolds that could not be anchored to the genetic map showed distorted segregation skewed towards zucchini and towards scallop alleles, respectively. some of these regions were also observed in the former f <dig> map, mainly in the previous lg  <dig> and lg  <dig> .

different functions were associated to the genes located in the distorted regions. some were directly related to the flowering process  . others are transcription factors involved in plant growth and development , in the embryogenesis process   <cit>  or genes related to hormone metabolism  . scallop and zucchini alleles were overrepresented in different regions, suggesting that the alleles in this region may be subjected to gametic or zygotic selection and/or related to preferential germination or better seedling viability. some of these unigenes may be the cause of the segregation distortion, but it could also be the result of linkage to other genes.

qtl analysis
given the low level of heterozygosity observed in the rils grown in paip <dig> , the gbs genotype for the rils is adequate for qtl analysis in the three environments after removing the heterozygous loci. we performed composite interval mapping with window size of 20 cm. qtl analysis based on genotypic data and phenotypic data for  <dig> traits, identified a total of  <dig> qtls  for vine, flowering and fruit traits that were detected with the full set of data and with the data from at least two environments separately. these qtls were distributed in  <dig> independent positions in  <dig> linkage groups. the proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by a single qtl  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. detailed information about all these qtls  is shown in table  <dig>  additional files  <dig> and  <dig> include additional data of the analyzed traits and qtls. identified qtls are discussed below grouped by traits.table  <dig> qtls detected for vine, flowering, plant and fruit traits

qtls detected using data from the ril population genotyped by gbs and phenotyped in three environments




vine-related traits
no significant qtls were found for vine size and architecture despite ril parents, zucchini and scallop, differed in growth habit , branching intensity , and plant length and number of nodes .

major qtls were identified for leaf traits, such as leaf blade incision and the occurrence of silver leaf  , both traits related to photosynthesis rate. zucchini plants developed deeply incised leaves whereas scallop plants had weak incisions . large genetic correlations between locations where found for these two traits, r x, y ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   indicating that the norm of reaction for each genotype was similar in the three environments.


li_ <dig>  explained most of the variation found in this trait . anova results show a lack of environment effect and of g x e interaction , with rils with zucchini alleles having deeper incisions than rils with scallop alleles  in all environments  . two genes belonging to the homeobox-leucine zipper protein family were annotated in the li_ <dig> region  . the best hit of these cucurbita genes  was with homeobox-leucine zipper protein athb-22-like of cucumis melo. this family of homeobox genes has roles in meristem identity and in the regulation of leaf development in several plant species  <cit> . these could be good candidates to explain differences in leaf morphology found in this population.fig.  <dig> effect of the qtl li_ <dig>  controlling the intensity of leaf insertion. a up: rils with the zucchini genotype and down rils with the scallop genotype; b violin plot of the leaf insertion phenotypic values in the three assays for the aa  and the bb  genotypes




the zucchini and scallop parents also differed in the occurrence leaf silvering. this is a typical feature of the zucchini parental, whereas scallop develops uniformly green leaves . silver mottling of leaves is caused by the development of large air spaces between palisade cells and the epidermis. this trait has been reported to be controlled by a dominant single gene , with modifiers . also non-genetic factors, such as variation in light and temperature and drought stress, affect the expression of the silvery-leaf trait. squash leaf silvering can also appear as a systemic response to whitefly feeding  <cit> . one major qtl, explaining  <dig> % of the observed variation, was identified in our population in lg  <dig>  sl_ <dig>  . rils with the zucchini alleles in that region show different degrees of silvering, whereas those with the scallop genotype develop green leaves in all the environments  . in fact no significant environment or g x e effect was found for this trait . other two qtls had lod values above the threshold in the analysis with all the data , sl_ <dig>  and sl_ <dig>  . however, these explained a low percentage of the observed variation , and were not significant in all the assayed environments, showing a significant g x e interaction .fig.  <dig> effect of the qtl sl_ <dig>  controlling the occurrence of leaf silvering. a up: rils with the zucchini genotype and down rils with the scallop genotype. b violin plot of the silver leaf phenotypic values in the three assays for the aa  and the bb  genotypes




silvered leaves exhibit reduced photosynthetic ability, but this trait also seems to have a favorable effect on protection against aphids or plant desiccation, as silvery leaves reflect more light than non- silvery leaves  <cit> . a further study of the genes annotated in the corresponding qtl intervals  is of interest to identify candidates involved in the variation of this trait and to manage it in breeding programs.

flowering time related traits
cucurbits have become model species for the study of plant sex determination and some genes involved in sex expression  have been characterized in melon, cucumber and squash . most of them are enzymes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, signaling and regulation. the cucurbita orthologs of some of the cloned genes  are located in lg  <dig>  lg  <dig>  lg  <dig>  lg  <dig>  and lg  <dig> . other genes, such as ctr <dig> and ctr <dig>  that confer reduced ethylene sensitivity and have been reported to be involved in the male/female ratio in c. pepo  <cit>  are located in lg  <dig> and lg  <dig> . no significant qtls involved in the variation of the flowering traits analyzed in this study colocalize with any of these regions . this result is not unexpected as the zucchini and scallop accessions do not differ in sex expression, being both monoecious. in fact, sex expression is less variable in cucurbita than in cucumis crops, cucumber and melon.

early flowering, however, is a highly variable and economically important agronomic trait related to early yield in c. pepo. it is affected by genetic, environmental and hormonal factors  <cit> . zucchini and scallop do differ in flowering time, mainly in the days to the development of the first male and female flower, being the scallop parental more late-flowering than zucchini squash . genetic correlations between locations for this trait were positive and significant, although moderate  . the analysis of the ril population suggests the existence of at least two genomic regions controlling flowering time. we found a qtl  involved in the earliness of female flowers in lg  <dig>  . anova results also indicate a significant effect of the environment and a lack of g x e interaction in this locus . the rils homozygous for the zucchini alleles developed the first female flower in all environments between  <dig> and 8 days before than those homozygous for the scallop allele  . one additional minor qtl involved in the variation of the same trait was found in lg  <dig> , dfef_ <dig>  , with significant e and g x e effects. significant differences between the rils with the zucchini versus scallop genotypes in this region were found in two environments, with an advance of the female flowering from  <dig> to 6 days  .

some candidate genes are found in these regions , opening new possibilities for the study of the genetics of this poorly studied trait. for example, two mads-box genes are annotated in the dfef_ <dig> region  that are most similar to the momordica charantia agamous like6-like protein  and to the mads-box protein soc1-like from c. sativus. the agl <dig> gene acts as a floral promoter in arabidopsis through the control of the transcription of key regulators of flowering time , the main flowering switch gene in arabidopsis, and the flowering locus t ). the overexpression of this gene results in a late-flowering phenotype  <cit> . also the overexpression of soc1-like stimulate flowering in different species  <cit> . in this region is also located a tcp transcription factor . the tcp gene family plays important roles in regulating diverse processes, including phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction, branching and flower development  <cit> . a gene of this family was also annotated in the distorted region of lg  <dig> described above .

variation in flowering time has been less studied than sex expression in cucurbits and little is known about the underlying genetic mechanism. in a recent study conducted in cucumber, a candidate gene for early flowering was identified , which is a homolog of the arabidopsis locus t  <cit> . our results suggest that the regulation of the ft gene is also a main mechanism underlying the variation of the flowering time in c. pepo. the c. pepo ortholog of the csa1g <dig> is located in the scaffold <dig>  that could not be mapped to any of the c. pepo linkage groups. this scaffold showed a high degree of distorted segregation towards the zucchini alleles , which is consistent with the idea that scallop alleles in this locus have resulted in late flowering affecting the reproduction of the carrier rils during the selfing process. it remains to be studied if the presence of zucchini regions in dfef_ <dig> results in a change of ft expression associated to the early flowering genotypes.

additionally, three genes are located in the region of the dfef_ <dig>  that can be associated to the flowering process, one annotated as wuschel-related homeobox   and a second gene as an auxin response factor  <dig> . wox genes are a large group of transcription factors essential in maintaining shoot apical meristem, some of which play important roles in the regulation of floral patterning. some of these processes are conducted through the regulation of auxin transport  <cit> . the third candidate in this region is an ethylene-responsive transcription factor   as flowering is also associated to ethylene metabolism. further research is necessary to determine whether flowering time traits co-segregate with variation in these genes.

none of these qtls colocalize with the major qtl in lg  <dig> controlling several flowering traits  detected using the f <dig> population of the same cross and the previous map by esteras et al.  <cit> . former lg  <dig> corresponds to lg  <dig> and lg  <dig> in the current map . the snps flanking the flowering qtl in the f <dig> map  were located in cp32_scaffold <dig>  and cp32_scaffold <dig> , the first and second ones anchored in one end of the lg  <dig> and the last in another end of the lg  <dig>  the cp32_scaffold <dig> presents a high percentage of distorted markers , thus as described before we were not able to merge this two lg into one. therefore, likely the lack of markers in this region is the reason why this main qtl detected in the f <dig> was not detected in the rils population. in this region are two ethylene insensitive <dig>  genes and one ethylene-responsive transcription factor  annotated  encoding transcription factors that represent downstream components of ethylene signaling, also reported to be involved in flowering  <cit> .

fruit morphology
squash fruit morphology is related to different traits: fruit weight, fruit shape, fruit length and width, number of locules, and ribbing intensity. zucchini and scallop immature and mature fruits did not significantly differ in fruit weight, but they did differ in fruit shape . fruit shape differences were mainly due to differences in fruit length .

genetic correlations between locations were very high for some traits related to immature and mature fruit shape , and moderate for some others  .

a major qtl affecting immature fruit shape, ifsh_ <dig>  colocalized in lg  <dig> with major qtls affecting immature fruit length and width   . zucchini alleles in this region resulted in more elongated immature fruits, significantly longer and narrower than fruits with scallop alleles  . differences were significant in the three environments. the effect of the environment was significant for ifle and iflwi, whereas no significant g x e interaction was found in any of the traits . these shape differences were also appreciated in mature fruits, affecting more to fruit length than to width  . in fact, qtls involved in the mature fruits shape, length and width colocalized in the same region, mfsh_ <dig>  mfle_ <dig> and mfwi_ <dig>  . no effect was observed in this region for fruit weight, number of locules, and other traits associated to fruit morphology, such as ribbing intensity. this region is the same found in the previous map  located in lg  <dig>  <cit> , controlling the length of immature and mature fruits, and associated fruit shape traits . the comparison between the f <dig> and the ril genetic map indicates the correspondence between lg  <dig>  and lg  <dig>  . the genetic basis of variation in fruit shape has been studied most extensively in tomato and in other cucurbits such as melon. for example in melon, some qtls associated to fruit shape colocalize with members of the ovate family proteins . genes of this family are also involved in tomato fruit morphology . the anchorage of the ril map to the genome sequence provide the list of genes annotated in the ifsh_ <dig>  ifle_ <dig>  ifwi_ <dig>  mfsh_ <dig>  mfle_ <dig> and mfwi_ <dig> region . interestingly, this list includes an ofp gene , the ortholog of the ofp2-like gene of cucumis sativus, which likely contributes to the observed variation in c. pepo fruit shape.fig.  <dig> effect of qtls controlling fruit shape. a effect of the qtl ifle_ <dig> and ifsh <dig>  controlling immature fruit shape. up: rils with the zucchini genotype and down rils with the scallop genotype. b effect of the qtl mfle_ <dig> and mfsh_ <dig>  controlling mature fruit shape. up: rils with the zucchini genotype and down rils with the scallop genotype. c and d violin plots of the immature and mature fruit length phenotypic values in the three assays for the aa  and the bb  genotypes




two additional minor qtls affecting immature fruit shape and length, ifsh_ <dig>  that colocalized in lg  <dig> with minor qtls affecting immature and mature fruit length and width  , and ifle_ <dig>  were identified . in all cases zucchini alleles increased fruit length, but the effects of these qtls were much lower than that of qtls in lg  <dig> and significant differences were found only in some environments .

also four additional regions in lg  <dig> , lg  <dig> , lg  <dig> , and lg  <dig>  affected mature fruit shape and length, mfsh_ <dig>  mfsh_ <dig>  mfle_ <dig> and mfle_ <dig>  . mfle_ <dig> was the only qtl in which the scallop alleles increased fruit length  . in these four qtls the effect was only observed in mature fruits, suggesting that different regions affect fruit shape in the early and late steps of fruit development. several genes had been previously reported to be related to fruit shape in c. pepo  <cit> . a dominant gene  was reported associated to the discoidal fruit shape of scallop squash. this gene was suggested to be dominant over spherical or pyriform shapes. a digenic epistatic control has also been reported for summer squash fruit shape. our results are consistent with the existence of a major gene, that could be the ovate underlying the ifle_ <dig> qtl, and several minor modifiers.

apart from fruit length and width, there are other traits associated to fruit morphology. the scallop fruit is strongly scalloped with deeper ribs than zucchini . the ribbing intensity was variable in the ril population. three qtls involved in this trait were detected, one controlling ribbing intensity in immature fruits, ifrib_ <dig>  and two in mature fruits, mfrib_ <dig> , and mfrib_ <dig>  . zucchini alleles in the ifrib_ <dig> region resulted in more ribbed fruits, although not in all environments . in fact, both environment and g x e effects were significant for ifrib_ <dig>  whereas in mfrib_ <dig> and mfrib_ <dig> resulted in less ribbed fruits  in all environments, with no significant g x e effects. mfrib_ <dig>  that explained the highest percentage of the variation found in this trait , had been previously detected in the map of the f <dig> population  . transcription factors belonging to the wox family have been reported to control the carpel number  <cit> . we did not find genes belonging to this family in the reported regions, so other genes must be underlying these qtls .fig.  <dig> effect of the mfrib_ <dig>  controlling the occurrence of ribbing in mature fruits. a up: rils with the zucchini genotype and down rils with the scallop genotype; b violin plot of the mature ribbing phenotypic values in the three assays for the aa  and the bb  genotypes




peduncle length is also involved in fruit typology. significant differences were found among parents in the three environments, with shorter peduncles in the zucchini fruits . genetic correlations between assays were moderate for peduncle traits . three qtls were identified controlling immature and mature fruit peduncle length : ipele_ <dig> , ipele_ <dig>  and mpele_ <dig> . these qtls have opposite effects of the zucchini versus scallop alleles  .

fruit color
apart from fruit shape, other factors involved in fruit quality have been studied: organoleptic , nutritional , and physical . zucchini and scallop parents did not differ in flesh firmness, brix degree and ph, but clearly differed in fruit color, both of rind and flesh. color was measured with colorimeter . the zucchini parent develops immature dark green fruits  with light green flesh  in the three environments. immature scallop fruits have light green rinds  and light green flesh, similar to that of the zucchini fruits . color differences were more significant in mature fruits. zucchini fruits were dark green , and the flesh varied from light green to light yellow or orange at physiological maturity . however, the scallop fruits remained white, both rind and flesh, at full maturity . genetic correlations between environment were very high for the l trait  and from moderate to high for the a and b color parameters  measured both in fruit rinds and flesh .

we found a major region controlling the rind color of the immature and mature fruit in lg  <dig>  the major qtls ilrco_ <dig> and ibrco_ <dig> , explaining most of the variability found in immature rind color, colocalized with two major qtls explaining most of the variation found in mature rind color, mlrco_ <dig> and mbrco_ <dig>  . these qtls control the occurrence of rind dark green color. in fact, the fruits from rils with zucchini alleles develop immature/mature fruits with darker green primary color, with or without stripped or mottle secondary color pattern, and with low values of l and b parameters   . these major qtls colocalize with the major qtl for the rind color of mature fruits mapped previously in lg  <dig> with the f <dig> population   <cit>  that correspond to lg  <dig> in the ril map .fig.  <dig> effect of qtls controlling fruit rind color. a effect of the qtl ilrco_ <dig>  controlling immature fruit rind color. up: rils with the zucchini genotype and down rils with the scallop genotype; b effect of the qtl mlrco_ <dig>  controlling mature fruit rind color. up: rils with the zucchini genotype and down rils with the scallop genotype. c and d violin plots of the immature/mature fruit rind color  in the three assays for the aa  and the bb  genotypes




in the lod peak region of these qtls, two genes annotated as related to an arabidopsis aprr2-like    were found. genes of this family have been demonstrated to act as fruit-related regulators of pigment accumulation in tomato and pepper  <cit> . in fact the presence of a stop codon mutation explain color differences between the wild-type and a white-fruited pepper cultivar associated to differences in chlorophyll content. our results also suggest a similar function of these genes in the cucurbitaceae family.

apart from the main effect of ilrco_4-ibrco_4/mlrco-4mbrco_ <dig>  immature rind color seems to be controlled by additional genomic regions. the main ones were in lg  <dig> and lg  <dig>  the first region affected also flesh color, ilrco_ <dig>  iarco_ <dig>  iafco_ <dig> and ibfco_ <dig> . rils with scallop/zucchini genotype had immature fruits with different greenish and yellowish tones in rind and flesh  . a similar effect was found in lg  <dig> , but significant environment and g x e effect were found in this region . other less important regions  involved in the variation of immature rind color were ilrco_ <dig>  ibrco_ <dig> and ibrco_ <dig>  these results are consistent with the traditionally proposed genetic control for rind color in squash, with a major gene derived from the scallop genotype, w , complemented by modifiers, which confers a white or cream solid color independently of the genetic background. this gene has been reported to be epistatic to d  derived from zucchini squash that result in dark stem and dark intermediate-age fruit  <cit> . the aprr2-like genes underlying ilrco_4-ibrco_4/mlrco-4mbrco_ <dig> are good candidates to be the w previously described squash gene.

the rind color of mature fruits was more variable than the immature fruit color, as during the ripening process yellow and orange colors develop in some fruits . two qtls were found involved in the redness  variation  and in the yellowness  variation . the major qtl marco_ <dig> explained most of the variation found in marco , with the zucchini alleles resulting in fruits with more orange color in rinds in all environments  . the qtl mbrco_ <dig>  resulted in fruits with rind color variable for the yellowness trait . mbrco_ <dig> colocalized with the major qtl explaining variation in mature flesh color discussed below. two additional minor  qtls affecting rind lightness were detected in lg  <dig> and  <dig>  mlrco_ <dig> and mlrco_ <dig> with zucchini genotypes having darker fruits than scallops, but with a significant environment and g x e interaction .

the genetic control of external fruit color has been investigated in melons. recently, feder et al.  <cit>  identified a kelch domain-containing f-box protein regulating naringenin chalcone accumulation in melon rind producing the change from white to yellow rind. this gene  colocalizes with qtls involved in the variation of external color in melons  <cit> . in c. pepo, we found two genes annotated as f-box/kelch-repeat protein  in the lod peak regions of the marco_ <dig> qtl . also a zeaxanthin epoxidase  gene , an enzyme known to be involved in carotenoid metabolism  <cit> , was found in that region. also in the region of the qtl mbrco_ <dig> is annotated a phytoene synthase  enzyme , known to be involved in the carotenoids biosynthesis .

our data suggest that flesh color in mature fruits is controlled by two major regions in lg  <dig>  mbfco_ <dig>   and mafco_ <dig>  . the major qtl controlling flesh color, mbfco_ <dig>  corresponds to the qtl for mature fruit flesh color found previously in the f <dig> map in lg  <dig>  . zucchini alleles in this regions, mbfco_ <dig>  resulted in light orange fleshed fruits , with higher b values than those found in white-fleshed fruits from rils with scallop alleles . the effect of mafco_ <dig>  was similar although less pronounced , and significant e and g x e effects . in melon, flesh color is controlled by two major genes: green flesh   <cit>  and white flesh   <cit> . the gen wf has been recently isolated, corresponding to a close homolog of the cauliflower or  protein with the capacity of inducing β-carotene accumulation  <cit> . the c. pepo ortholog of this gene is located in cp32_scaffold00085- <dig>  the function of or is to induce the differentiation of plastids into chromoplasts for carotenoid accumulation. this protein contains a cysteine-rich zinc finger domain that is highly specific to dnaj-like molecular chaperons. it is possible that or works in association with a dnaj-like protein to bind to proteins specific for the plastid differentiation/division. underlying the qtls for flesh color mbfco_ <dig> and mafco_ <dig> there are several dnaj-like proteins, along with several enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, such as one phytoene synthase   and one carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase   . these genes are good candidates to be the previously described major gen wf , from scallop, which is dominant over colored flesh  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of the qtl mbfco_ <dig>  controlling mature fruit flesh color. a up: mature fruits of rils with the zucchini genotype and down rils with the scallop genotype; b violin plot of the mature fruit flesh color  in the three assays for the aa  and the bb  genotypes




other two minor qtls  involved in the variation of flesh color were also detected, although with significant e and g x e effect   that can act modulating the effect of the major gene, as it has been also reported in melons .

CONCLUSIONS
a high-quality snp marker collection has been developed for mapping and construction of the first saturated map in the species, with more than  <dig>  markers and anchored to the current version of the c. pepo genome by  <dig> scaffolds. the improvement in the number of markers per lg and the extensive phenotyping of the ril population, have enabled the detection of  <dig> qtls, most of them stable across three environments.

the availability of the c. pepo genome annotation https://cucurbigene.upv.es  <cit>  has facilitated the identification of candidate genes underlying most of these qtls, which will allow the knowledge of the underlying processes that give rise to these phenotypic traits. we can highlight the identification of candidate genes underlying the variation of qtls that explain more than 30% of the variation found in leaf incision, fruit shape, rind and flesh color, traits of evident economic importance, which can be exploited for searching new attractive market products and may also imply and increase of nutritional value.
