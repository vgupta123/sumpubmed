BACKGROUND
colonic epithelium faces a highly complex mixture of residual nutrients, resident bacteria and their metabolites. modifications of the luminal environment are known to affect the colonic epithelium and may result in colonic homeostasis perturbation by alteration of the barrier function, modification of the epithelial renewal and impairment of the mucosal immune response  <cit> . among several environmental factors, dietary changes have been shown to affect the colon luminal environment and mucosal homeostasis  <cit> .

hpd have a significant effect on the large intestine luminal ecosystem. indeed, hpd increase the amount of undigested peptides that reach the large intestine , modify the gut microbiota composition  and increase protein fermentation by the large intestine bacteria  resulting in the production of numerous amino acid-derived metabolites  <cit> . among them, ammonia, p-cresol and hydrogen sulfide have been found to inhibit colonocyte respiration, when present at high concentrations  <cit> . in addition, p-cresol has been shown to induce dna damage in colonocytes  <cit> . in contrast, other amino acid-derived metabolites such as indolic compounds contribute to the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis  <cit> .

these hpd-induced changes in the colonic luminal environment have been associated with several effects on the large intestine mucosa. in rats fed an hpd, the height of colonocyte brush border  is markedly reduced probably in relation with the observed perturbation of mitochondrial metabolism  <cit> . an hpd also modifies goblet cell distribution in rat colonic epithelium together with an increased gene expression of mucin  <dig>   <cit>  while it does not change colonic mucosal immune response except for a decreased interleukin- <dig>  mrna expression  <cit> . in hpd-fed piglets, mucin gene expression as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in the colonic mucosa without modification of the histological aspect  <cit> . in this latter animal model, there is no change in colonic barrier function after the hpd  <cit> . conflicting results, according to the model and/or the type of hpd used, have been reported regarding the induction of dna damage in colonocytes of rats fed an hpd . recently, it was concluded from microarray experiments that an hpd upregulates in rat colonic mucosa the expression of genes implicated in glutathione metabolism, chemotaxis, tumor necrosis factor-α signaling and apoptosis while it downregulates genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, glycosylation of mucins and innate immune responses  <cit> . since the colonic mucosa contains a cell mixture from epithelium, lamina propia and muscularis mucosae layers, it is not possible to determine from that study what are the effects of hpd specifically on colonic epithelial cells that are directly exposed to luminal changes induced by these diets.

in this context, the aim of the present study was to characterize the epithelial response to a whole milk protein-based hpd in rat colon compared to an npd. the experimental settings were similar to our previous studies showing an hpd-induced modulation of the microbiota composition and of the luminal bacteria metabolite content in the rat large intestine  <cit> . gene expression signature was determined by transcriptome profiling in combination with cellular and functional analysis to define the effects of an hpd consumption at the colonic epithelial level.

colonocyte isolation
colonic epithelial cells  were isolated as previously described  <cit> . briefly, colon was flushed with a nacl 9 g/l solution and then with a ca2+ and mg2+ -free krebs henseleit bicarbonate  buffer solution containing 10 mm hepes, 5 mm dtt, and  <dig>  g bovine serum albumin and equilibrated against a mixture of o <dig> and co <dig> . then, colon was perfused for 20 min at 37 °c with the same buffer containing 10 mm edta. colonocytes were detached by gently tapping the colon.

rna extraction from isolated colonocytes and microarray experiment

comet assay
dna strand breaks and alkali-labile sites in isolated colonocytes were assessed using the alkaline version of the comet assay. cells were rinsed with pbs and pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 200 g three times before re-suspension in sucrose  <dig>  g/l, dmso 50 ml/l prepared in citrate buffer , ph  <dig> , and immediately frozen at -80 °c. three microscope slides per condition were coated with 1% normal melting point agarose  and allowed to dry. ten thousand cells per slide were mixed with  <dig> % low melting point agarose  and deposited over the nma layer. the cell/lmpa mix was then allowed to solidify on ice for 20 min. slides were immersed in lysis solution  overnight at 4 °c, before being rinsed in  <dig>  m tris ph  <dig> . dna was then allowed to unwind for 1 h in alkaline electrophoresis solution . electrophoresis was performed in an electric field of 21 v and 300 ma for 20 min. slides were then neutralized in  <dig>  m tris ph  <dig>  and were stained with 20 μl of  <dig>  <dig> x diluted sybr gold . fifty μm h2o <dig>  were directly deposited onto the agarose layer containing the cells and were incubated for 20 min at 37 °c. at least  <dig> comets per slide were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope  connected to a charge-coupled device camera with a 350–390 nm excitation and 456 nm emission filter at x  <dig> magnification. comets were measured and analyzed using comet iv software .

histology
after an overnight fixation,  <dig>  cm sections of distal colon were embedded in paraffin wax. immunohistochemistry ki <dig> labelling was carried out on 4 μm-transversal colon sections at the cochin histim facility. after antigen unmasking in sodium citrate buffer 10 mm ph  <dig> , expression of ki <dig> was detected using an anti-ki <dig> antibody  and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.

western blot
isolated rat colonocytes were lysed in ripa buffer containing a protease inhibitors cocktail . total protein extracts  were loaded into 4–12% criterion xt gel  before electrophoresis in mops buffer . after transfer on nitrocellulose membrane and incubation in blocking solution  bsa, membranes were incubated overnight  with a primary antibody directed against activated-caspase  <dig>  or proliferating cell nuclear antigen  or claudin- <dig>  diluted in the blocking solution. after washes, blots were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse hrp-linked secondary antibody  or a goat anti-actin-hrp  diluted in the blocking solution. after  <dig> washes, detection was performed by chemiluminescence using clarity western ecl substrate  and the fluorchemfc <dig> device with alphaview software .

ussing chambers experiments
rat distal colon was mounted in the easymount  ussing chambers with an exposed area of  <dig>  cm <dig>  tissues were bathed in krebs-ringer bicarbonate buffer  with the following composition :  <dig> nacl,  <dig>  kcl,  <dig>  mgcl <dig>   <dig>  na2hpo <dig>   <dig>  nah2po <dig>   <dig> nahco <dig> and  <dig>  cacl <dig>  serosal krb contained 10 mm glucose  and mucosal krb, 10 mm mannitol . each chamber side was gassed with 95% o <dig> – 5%co <dig> and kept at 37 °c. after 15 min equilibration, the trans-mural potential  was continuously recorded in open circuit configuration by the automated dual-channel epithelial voltage clamp ec825a . each 15 min, the tissues were successively voltage-clamped to zero to obtain the short-circuit current  and a ± 5 μa current was pulsed to measure the trans-mural electrical resistance . analogue signals were digitized using the powerlab® 8/ <dig> data acquisition system and analyzed with the labchart® software .

fitc dextran  was used to evaluate the epithelial barrier integrity. after the 15 min tissue equilibration step, fd <dig> was added to the chamber mucosal side at the final concentration of  <dig>  mm.100 μl aliquots were collected from the serosal side every 15 min over two h and replaced with 100 μl of fresh krb. fluorescence was measured with the infinite®  <dig> pro spectrofluorimeter  with an excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 nm and 520 nm respectively, and fd <dig> amounts were calculated against a fd <dig> standard curve. the fd <dig> apparent permeability coefficient  was determined using the following equation: p
app =  x  where dq/dt is the fd <dig> transport rate across the epithelium , a is the exposed surface area , c
 <dig> is the initial fd <dig> concentration in the mucosal compartment .

statistical analysis
statistical analyses were performed with prism  <dig> sofware . mean values of measured parameters in npd and hpd-fed rat groups were compared with an unpaired t-test. differences with p-values <  <dig>  were considered as statistically significant.

RESULTS
as shown in fig. 1a, the macroscopic aspect of colon from rats fed an hpd or an npd were markedly different. colons from rats fed an hpd were distended due to a very large increase in luminal content . this observation supports the hypothesis that the hpd deeply reshaped the luminal environment in contact with epithelial cells.fig.  <dig>

effects of the high-protein diet on barrier function in colon
based on the predefined hypothesis that hpd could regulate mucus secretion  <cit> , mucins gene expression was specifically compared in the colonocytes of rats fed an hpd or an npd . the hpd significantly upregulated the expression of muc <dig>  muc5ac, muc <dig>  muc <dig> and muc <dig> . moreover, in the list of de genes , seven β-defensin genes were upregulated in colonocytes of rats fed an hpd when compared to an npd  . several canonical pathways related to cell adhesion were significantly enriched in the set of genes regulated by the hpd . the integrin signaling canonical pathway was predicted to be inhibited in colonocytes of hpd-fed rats . the hpd also regulated the expression of genes implicated in the following canonical pathways: tight junction signaling , actin-based motility by rho family gtpases, ilk  signaling, fak  signaling , reinforcing the possibility of an hpd-induced modification of colonocyte adhesion and interaction with extracellular matrix. however, the expression in colonocytes of the tight junction protein claudin- <dig> was not significantly regulated  by the hpd as measured by western blot . to evaluate the effect of the level of protein intake on colonic barrier integrity, distal colon segments were mounted into ussing chambers. after 15 min, distal colon transmural resistance tended  to be higher in rats fed an hpd when compared to rats fed an npd  while it was similar between both groups after 60 min . moreover, fd4-apparent paracellular permeability across the colon wall was similar in npd- and hpd-fed rats . in conclusion, these experiments showed that the hpd did not impair colonic barrier function in rat distal colon.fig.  <dig>

discussion
the results of the present study indicate that in the rat model, there is a marked colonic epithelial response to an hpd that is characterized by a specific transcriptional signature. the hpd downregulated, at the gene expression level, biological pathways related to cellular metabolism, glutathione metabolism, dna repair, nf-κb signaling, apoptosis and epithelial cell adhesion. in contrast, genes related to proliferation and chemical barrier function were upregulated by the hpd. these transcriptional changes induced by a short-term hpd were not associated with detrimental effects on the colonic epithelium in terms of genotoxicity, epithelial renewal and barrier integrity.

numerous genes downregulated in colonocytes by the hpd participate in cell metabolism and notably in protein synthesis. interestingly, several bacterial metabolites derived from amino acids  inhibit mitochondrial respiration when present in excess  <cit> . in addition, hpd increased proton leaks in rat colonocyte mitochondria leading to a lower energetic efficiency  <cit> . therefore, it is tempting to propose that the downregulation of genes implicated in cell metabolism may represent an adaptation allowing atp saving in colonocytes during hpd. indeed, the colonic epithelium has a high energy need related to its constant renewal, water and electrolyte transports and barrier function maintenance  <cit> .

several genes related to glutathione metabolism were downregulated in rat colonocytes after the hpd. notably, the hpd induced a decrease in gene expression of several glutathione-s-transferases  which are implicated in phase ii metabolism of xenobiotics but also in the control of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . in agreement with the present study, gst gene expression appeared to be reduced in the colon of pigs fed an hpd  <cit> . the hpd also induced a downregulation of genes encoding proteins involved in several dna-repair pathways, namely base excision repair , non-homologous end joining  and nucleotide excision repair   <cit>  but this was not associated with significant changes in dna damages in colonocytes of rats fed an hpd when compared to rats fed an npd. however, the hpd induced a trend toward lower dna damage in colonocytes. this result is in agreement with a recent report showing lower dna damages in rats fed with a moderate protein intake  compared to an npd   <cit> . moreover, two human studies found no increase in fecal water genotoxicity after a hpd  <cit> . in contrast, toden et al found that a casein-based or soy protein-based hpd induce dna damages in rat colonocytes while this effect was not found with whey protein-based hpd  <cit> . in the present study, the hpd contained whole milk protein. these differences in protein sources used in the studies might contribute to the divergent effects of hpd consumption. indeed, all the protein sources do not have the same digestibility, potentially modulating the quantity of dietary nitrogen entering in the large intestine  <cit> . however, all milk protein have very high digestibility in rats   <cit> , precluding a major role of this parameter to explain the divergent reported effects of milk protein-based hpd on dna damage. alternatively, differences between protein sources in amino acid composition, bioactive peptides or associated microconstituents might be implicated  <cit> .

the proliferation markers ki <dig> and pcna tended to be both more expressed in colonocytes of rats fed an hpd. this was concordant with the transcriptional overexpression in colonocytes of markers of epithelial proliferation such as metallothioneins  and tfrc  <cit>  while tumor suppressor genes such as ppp2r2a, ndrg <dig> and prdx <dig> were downregulated by the hpd  <cit> . in rats fed with the hpd, the expression of the apoptosis marker caspase  <dig> was unchanged in colonocytes, while there was a massive downregulation of cell death-related pathways at the mrna level. similar results were obtained in the colon of pigs fed an hpd: pcna being upregulated at the gene expression level while caspase  <dig> remaining unchanged  <cit> . collectively, these data suggest that hpd act on epithelium renewal by favoring colonocyte proliferation but not apoptosis.

the hpd-induced downregulation of pathways implicated in epithelial cell junction and adhesion of colonocytes to extracellular matrix might jeopardize barrier function. however, in ussing chamber experiments, transmural resistance and apparent permeability to fd <dig>  were similar in rat fed an npd or an hpd, indicating that colonic barrier integrity was not altered. these results are consistent with our previous electronic microscopy observation showing that there was no alteration of tight junction structure in colonic epithelium of rats fed an hpd  <cit>  and with another study showing that colonic barrier function is preserved in hpd-fed piglets  <cit> .

a very striking result of the present study was the inhibition of the nf-κb pathway in colonocytes of rats fed an hpd. in epithelial cells, nf-κb plays a central role in immune homeostasis, epithelial renewal and maintenance of barrier function  <cit> . since one of the nf-κb activation pathways is the stimulation of pattern recognition receptors by luminal bacteria, it can be hypothesized that the hpd decreased the contact between commensals and the epithelium. a lower stimulation by toxic compounds from the luminal side could also explain the decreased expression of genes related to glutathione metabolism and dna repair observed in colonocytes of rats fed an hpd. in the present study, potential mechanisms for a reduced contact of the microbiota and its metabolites with the epithelium are the reinforcement of the mucus barrier and the increase in antimicrobial peptides secretion  <cit> . indeed, five mucin genes, including muc <dig> , were upregulated in epithelial cells of hpd-fed rats in agreement with previous studies in rats and pigs  <cit> . moreover, seven β-defensin genes were overexpressed after the hpd. since muc <dig> has been shown to induce the expression of β-defensin  <dig>  <cit> , the simultaneous mucin and β-defensin gene upregulations in colonocytes after the hpd might be two coordinated components of a protective adaptive response to the modifications of the luminal environment induced by the hpd  <cit> .

the results obtained in the present study are not in agreement with the transcriptome profile recently described in the colonic mucosa of rats fed an hpd  <cit> . indeed, mu et al. found that genes related to glutathione metabolism and apoptosis were upregulated by the hpd while the data of the present study indicated the opposite. for example, mgst <dig>  and ripk <dig>  were significantly regulated by the hpd in the two studies but with opposite direction. three differences in the experimental designs of the two studies may explain these discrepancies. first, the present study used whole milk protein while mu et al. used a protein isolate of casein  <cit> . as discussed above, the protein source might modulate the effects of hpd on gene expression in the colon. secondly, gene expression was analyzed in the present study in isolated colonic epithelial cells while mu et al. described the transcriptome in the whole colonic mucosa  <cit> . since the gene expression patterns in the colonic epithelium and in the stroma are clearly distinct  <cit> , the discrepancies between the two studies might be related to the different type of cells analyzed. thirdly, the different durations of the studies  probably also explain part of the differences in the regulation of gene expression by the hpd. indeed, time-course microarray experiments revealed early and late transcriptomic response to dietary challenge in mice  <cit> . in the present study, the hpd lasted 2 weeks since previous results obtained using the same experimental model indicated that changes in gut microbiota composition and luminal bacteria metabolite content occurred within this duration  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a 2-week hpd in rat did not impair the colonic epithelium in term of dna-damages, epithelial renewal and barrier function. however, the transcriptional signature in colonocytes of rats fed an hpd indicates a downregulation of pathways implicated in crucial cellular processes such as nf-κb signaling, dna repair and glutathione metabolism. these changes might be detrimental for the epithelium since a decreased expression and activity of gst is associated with colorectal cancer through a defect in carcinogen detoxification  <cit> , unrepaired dna damages can lead to genomic instability  <cit>  and maintenance of an appropriate activation of nf-κb is crucial for epithelial homeostasis  <cit> . further experiments are obviously required to determine the long-term consequences of hpd on the colonic epithelium, taking into account that prolonged downregulation of the expression of genes associated with cell protection may be detrimental for colon mucosa health.
