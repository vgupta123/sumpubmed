BACKGROUND
food components play a role in influencing, either directly or indirectly , the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in energy metabolism, cell differentiation and growth and immune responses. more specifically, diet exerts diverse effects on the development of the immune system, even at the level of gene regulation  <cit> . it is known that polyunsaturated fatty acids  can modulate the expression of a variety of genes encoding for cytokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory proteins  <cit> . this fact seems to be very important during early life, since docosahexanoic and arachidonic acids were reported to participate in the development of the neonate immune system, although their proportion among total fatty acids in human breast milk is very low  <cit> . human milk contains pufas such as conjugated linoleic acid , among others, that seem to contribute to immune development  <cit> .

cla is a class of positional and geometric conjugated dienoic isomers of linoleic acid, among which, cis <dig> trans <dig>  predominate, accounting for 83% to 100% of total cla present in milk  <cit> , whereas trans <dig> cis <dig>  exist in lower proportion  <cit> . however, it is the intake of food of ruminant origin which determines the total concentration of cla in dam's milk  <cit> . many other beneficial physiological effects have also been attributed to cla, including reduced body fat, and inhibition of carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis, and diabetes  <cit> .

existing data regarding the effects of cla on the immune system show great variability, mainly due to differences in the animal species used, the length of the supplementation period, and the differences in the isomer mixtures used in the experimental approach. in this direction, recent studies in suckling animals showed that the immune function is enhanced after feeding with an 80: <dig> isomer mix of c <dig> t <dig> and t <dig> c <dig> cla  <cit> . specifically, sera igg concentration and igm in vitro production by splenocytes are increased after cla supplementation during suckling. cla downmodulatory effects on lymphoproliferation were only observed after an extra week of diet  <cit> . the immune effects of cla were also described in adult rats receiving this mixture since pregnancy  <cit> . however, little work has been done on the effects of cla on gene expression, and even less regarding the development of the immune system in early life.

nutritional genomics is a result of the genetic revolution experienced over the past  <dig> years. nutrigenomics deals with the interactions between dietary components and the genome and the resulting changes in proteins and other metabolites. on the other hand, nutrigenetics aims to understand the gene-based differences in response to dietary components and to develop nutraceuticals that are the most compatible with the health status of individuals based on their genetic makeup  <cit> . the number of successful examples of transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome profiling as tools for evaluating the cellular responses to nutrients and identifying their molecular targets, has grown significantly. the use of high-density microarrays is a useful approach to estimate correlations among genes, which in turn can become the basis of transcriptional networks. the availability of microarrays for a number of model systems allows the quantification of relative transcript abundances in a comprehensive fashion. despite the relatively simplistic nature of correlation measurements, they reflect an integrative view of gene-gene interactions in any given system, pointing out general structure characteristics of transcriptional interaction networks  <cit> .

additionally, nutrigenomic approaches have been undertaken to get further insight on the molecular understanding of mechanisms triggered by nutritional interventions. diets enriched in different long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  have been tested in rat nutritional intervention models. one report revealed steaoryl-coa desaturase as an enzyme target for an arachidonate-enriched diet  <cit> . in another study, berger et al.  <cit>  looked at transcriptional effects of these lc-pufa-enriched diets on murine hepatic and hippocampal gene expression. additionally, the beneficial effect of lc-pufas was assessed by a nutrigenomics experiment designed to understand the mechanisms by which these lipids induce and control gene signalling involved in carcinogenesis  <cit> .

with all these concepts in mind and based on previous studies, we hypothesized that cla intake during developmental phases would exert some influencing effect, among others, on genes involved in the regulation of the immune system. the aim of our study was the evaluation, by using whole genome microarrays, of the effects of dietary supplementation with an 80: <dig> isomer mix of c <dig> t <dig> and t <dig> c <dig> cla, on mesenteric lymph nodes  gene expression, during gestation and/or suckling. the list of common genes differentially expressed in the three dietary interventions was used to construct a biological association network . this approach allowed us to obtain a global view of gene expression in mln, formed by a collection of nodes with different degrees of interrelationship, that could be used to explain the molecular mechanisms triggered by cla.

RESULTS
effect of cla supplementation on rat mln gene expression profiles
wistar rats were subjected to a dietary supplementation during gestation and/or suckling with an 80: <dig> isomer mix of c <dig> t <dig> and t <dig> c <dig> cla . cla transfer was confirmed at day  <dig>  when the proportion of cla present in pup's plasma was around two times higher in groups a and b than that in group c, while values on reference group were very low  <cit> . at day  <dig>  mln were obtained and total rna was prepared. the expression profile of mln from control animals and supplemented with cla was determined with the aid of the specific genechip® rat genome  <dig>  <dig> , which includes more than  <dig>  rat genes. data from these microarrays were uploaded in the database repository of gene expression omnibus  and can be accessed through series accession number gse <dig>  upon normalization and statistical filtering using genespring gx software package v <dig> . <dig>  lists of differentially expressed genes by 2-fold were built as described in methods, and presented as additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cla supplementation during gestation and suckling  modulated the expression of  <dig> genes whereas the dietary supplementation only during suckling modulated the expression of  <dig> genes. moreover, cla supplementation during gestation and suckling through dam's milk  decreased the expression of  <dig> genes and up-regulated  <dig> genes in mln. the dietary supplementation during gestation and suckling by oral gavage  decreased the expression of  <dig> genes and up-regulated  <dig> genes, whereas supplementation only during suckling  decreased the expression of  <dig> genes and up-regulated  <dig> genes in mln.

identification of common genes modulated by cla supplementation
venn diagrams were used to compare the lists of 2-fold differentially expressed genes obtained for the three experimental groups of animals . lists of upregulated and dowregulated genes were compared separately in order to find the same expression patterns between the dietary interventions compared . experimental groups a and b shared  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes, groups a and c displayed  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes in common and  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes were found in common for both groups b and c. a total of  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed in all three conditions due to cla supplementation . these  <dig> genes are presented as table  <dig>  we also analyzed global changes in gene expression independently of the type of regulation. we observed that  <dig> genes displayed downregulation in group a  and upregulation in groups b/c  . this behavior suggests a role for the way of cla administration in modulating gene expression.

the lists of genes differentially expressed by 2-fold with a p-value <  <dig>  obtained for each experimental group were compared using venn diagrams in genespring gx software v  <dig> . <dig>  the table shows the list of genes differentially expressed in all three conditions, and includes the gene symbol for all genes, their associated description and one of the gene onthology categories to which the genes belong according to genespring gx. the ratio columns correspond to the absolute fold change in expression for the genes in each experimental group  relative to the control group  and the type of regulation 

detection of gene nodes upon ban generation
a ban was generated as described in methods with the list of differentially expressed genes in common among the three groups of animals. this type of graphical representation evidenced several genes, such as connective tissue growth factor , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  <dig> , galanin , synaptotagmin  <dig> , growth factor receptor bound protein  <dig> , actin gamma  <dig>  and smooth muscle alpha actin , as highly interconnected nodes of the resulting network .

validation of node-genes selected from the ban
we proceeded to validate the differential expression of the node-genes to verify the changes in their mrna levels. real-time pcr offers a non hybridization-based detection and was chosen as complementary to microarrays. the genes selected from the ban representation were analyzed by rt-real time pcr under the same experimental conditions as for the microarray analyses. results are shown in figure  <dig>  where the levels of mrna determined both in the microarrays and by rt-real time pcr for each gene in each experimental group are represented. in mln, the mrna levels for gal and actg <dig> were decreased by around 99%, and those of timp <dig> and syt <dig> decreased by 90-95% upon cla administration in all groups of animals tested . treatment with cla also decreased mrna expression of ctgf and acta <dig> by around 80% . grb <dig> showed no changes in gene expression when determined by rt-real time pcr , at variance with the data obtained from the microarrays. these results confirmed the rna data obtained in the screening performed using the microarrays for all the selected genes with the exception of grb <dig> 

discussion
in this work, we analyzed the gene expression profile of mln cells from suckling rats receiving an 80: <dig> c <dig> t11:t <dig> c <dig> cla mix during early life. this particular mixture enriched with the c <dig> t <dig> isomer was used due to its resemblance with that in human breast milk  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that this mix modulates immune development in suckling rats receiving it during gestation/suckling  <cit> . the main effect of this type of diet was found regarding immunoglobulin production at systemic and intestinal level  <cit> . however, the precise mechanism of action of this pufa was not established. thus, we used microarrays to get further insight in the effects of cla supplementation on mln gene expression. a large number of genes were modulated when cla was administered during gestation and suckling . however, the use of venn diagrams evidenced that many genes were differentially expressed in both groups b and c, and less common genes were found between group a and the others. this behavior could be due to the different nutritional intervention that was performed. in the group a, cla was added to the diet of the dams during suckling period and therefore cla was incorporated in breast milk and transferred to the suckling pups. however, in groups b and c, cla was directly administered by oral gavage to the suckling pups. this fact influences the proportion between the two cla isomers that get to pups, as the ratio of c <dig> t <dig> cla/t <dig> c <dig> cla in pups's plasma was 83: <dig> for group a, but 93: <dig> for group b and 94: <dig> for group c as previously described  <cit> .

the list of differentially expressed genes in the three conditions was used to generate a ban. several node genes, namely ctgf, timp <dig>  gal, syt <dig>  actg <dig> and acta <dig>  were selected from this ban, and changes in their mrna expression were confirmed by rt-real time pcr. some of these node-genes may explain the behavior of cla as immune modulator during early age.

connective tissue growth factor  is a secreted extracellular matrix-associated protein that modulates many cellular functions, including proliferation, migration, adhesion, and extracellular matrix production, and it is involved in several biological and pathological processes  <cit> . dietary supplementation with cla reduced mrna levels of ctgf in mln in our three experimental approaches, indicating that downregulation of ctgf is independent of the length and via of cla supplementation. ctgf is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level by bioactive lipids, as well as tgfβ and downstream mitogen-activated protein  kinase signaling  <cit> .

we have previously reported that young  and adult animals fed with the same cla mixture showed a reduction in the proliferation activity of spleen and mln cells  <cit> . given that ctgf promotes dna synthesis in chondrocytes, osteoblasts and fibroblasts  <cit> , the observed decrease in proliferation could be mediated through ctgf downregulation.

tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases  are multifunctional proteins including four members . timp <dig> is expressed and secreted by a variety of cell types and is present in most tissues  <cit> . timp <dig> is able to promote cell growth, and its expression levels inversely correlate with the susceptibility to induction of apoptosis .

until now, two studies have reported different effects of cla on timp <dig> expression. on one hand, 1% cla diet in a mice model of metastatic mammary tumor increased mrna and protein levels of timp <dig>  <cit> , whereas an in vitro study using pure cla isomers  on a macrophage cell line did not modify timp <dig> gene expression  <cit> . thus, the effect of cla on timp <dig> expression may depend on the tissue microenvironment and the experimental approach used. in our study, cla administration reduced mrna levels for timp <dig> in all three groups of animals. as timp <dig> may stimulate cell proliferation by using several distinct signalling pathways, such as mapk, the inhibitory effect of cla on this gene may reduce lymphoproliferation. thus, both timp <dig> and ctgf would play a role in a same signaling pathway that could explain the downmodulation of the lymphoproliferative response observed in 28-day-old animals fed with cla from birth  <cit> .

the neuropeptide galanin  was also downregulated at the mrna level by early cla administration, independently of length, duration and via of supplementation. this peptide exerts a wide range of effects, not only in the central nervous system  <cit>  but also in the enteric nervous system  <cit> . although gal is mainly produced by neurons, it has been described that lymphocytes and macrophages can also synthesize it at a lower level  <cit> . a clear effect of neuropeptides such as somatostatin  or vasoactive intestinal peptide , including gut-associated immune system , has been already reported on the immune system  <cit> . when these neuropeptides are found in the intestine, they seem to affect the proliferation, differentiation and function of immune cells  <cit> . thus, the effect of cla on gal expression could explain the immunoenhancing effects of cla on developing galt  <cit> .

there is no data available on the effects of gal on lymphoproliferation. som and vip are mainly inhibitors of lymphocyte proliferation, apparently by reducing interleukin- <dig> production  <cit> , whereas calcitonin-gene-related-peptide , substance p  or met-enkephalin stimulate lymphoproliferation  <cit> . gal-mediated effects through its receptor galr <dig> led to antiproliferative effects, whereas those through galr <dig> and galr <dig> were proliferative. all three receptors are expressed in immune cells  <cit> . when the same cla mix was administered to young rats supplemented during suckling  <cit>  or until adult age  <cit> , a downmodulatory activity on proliferation in both spleen and mln was observed, suggesting that this effect may be mediated in part by modulation of gal expression. thus, cla is able to reduce gal promoting activity on lymphoproliferation, indicating that gal would be acting mainly through its galr <dig> and galr <dig> receptors in that environment.

during early life cla is able to enhance the production of immunoglobulins  <cit>  and more specifically iga in the intestine  <cit> . enhancement of intestinal iga concentration by cla could be due to the decrease of gal expression in mln, as it is the case for som in murine spleen, peyer patches and mln  <cit> . moreover, as neuropeptides influence cytokine production, downregulation of gal by cla may be the responsible effector of the changes in cytokine concentrations found in previous studies  <cit> . however, the effect on gal found here in early life, and their parallel immune effects, may not be present at older ages, since the maturation state of lymphocytes seem to affect the response to neuropeptides and cytokines due to their differential neuropeptidergic receptor expression  <cit> . this fact is in agreement with the effect described for cla on developing immune system and immunoglobulin production  <cit> , which is not observed later in life.

synaptotagmins  constitute a family of proteins that act as ca2+-sensors for regulated exocytosis and endocytosis  <cit> . synaptotagmin proteins were first detected in the nervous system, but their expression has also been reported in other tissues. thus, synaptotagmins have been proposed to be widespread regulatory proteins that confer ca2+-sensitivity in a wide range of fusion events  <cit> . indeed, syts have been described to play a role in the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity  <cit> , in cell resealing  <cit> , in chemotactic cell migration  <cit> , in insulin release from the pancreatic β-cells  <cit> , in fgf- <dig> secretion in response to heat shock  <cit>  and in degranulation of mast cells  <cit> .

cla supplementation caused downregulation of syt <dig> by about  <dig>  fold in the three dietary approaches. syt <dig> is mainly localized in synaptic vesicles, where it functions as a ca2+-sensor for exocytosis  <cit> . indeed, syt <dig> has been proposed to play specific roles in synaptic vesicles trafficking, in facilitating docking  <cit> , and in vesicle fusion  <cit> . although it has been traditionally proposed to be a neuron-specific isoform, syt <dig> has been demonstrated to have important roles in membrane trafficking in non-neural and non-hormonal cells  <cit> .

syt <dig> was previously associated with cla supplementation, as its expression was significantly decreased in mice receiving a diet enriched in the t <dig> c <dig> cla isomer compared with c <dig> t <dig> cla  <cit> . syt <dig> downregulation was associated with the presence of hepatic fat, suggesting that changes in expression of syt <dig> may indicate that other genes than the traditional are involved in lipid handling in hepatic cells, and probably in mln. syt <dig> has also been shown to play a role in neurotransmitter release  <cit> . as described above, we found the neuropeptide gal underexpressed upon cla supplementation. since it has been described that gal is secreted by enteric nerves  <cit> , we propose that downregulation of syt <dig> upon cla supplementation would lead to a decrease in gal secretion, thus enhancing the negative effects that downregulation of gal would have on lymphoproliferation.

actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in various types of cell motility, and maintenance of the cytoskeleton. in vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta and gamma have been identified. the alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. the beta and gamma actins co-exist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility. there are three α-actins , one β-actin , and two γ-actins   <cit> . the cytoskeleton constitutes a network that serves to maintain cell shape and to regulate dynamic cellular functions. it provides essential scaffolding for the localization and activation or inhibition of diverse cytoplasmic signaling molecules, as well as anchors for motor proteins that are necessary for intracellular transport and cell division  <cit> . in our microarray experiments we found that expression of smooth muscle γ-actin , found in enteric tissues, and α2-actin  were decreased upon dietary supplementation with cla.

alpha-smooth muscle actin expression is regulated by tgf-β and tnf-α. changes in alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen, and fibronectin expression result in decreased contraction and stiffness of collagen matrices  <cit> . the effect of tgf-β has been related to a conserved tgf-β control element  within the 5'-region of alpha-smooth muscle actin, also known as smooth muscle cell differentiation marker. tce could mediate both transcriptional activation and repression in cultured smooth muscle cells through interaction with members of the zinc finger kruppel-like transcription factor family  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been reported that tgf-β <dig> is able to significantly increase acta <dig> expression in both normal and cancer associated fibroblasts cultures  <cit> , which are believed to promote tumor growth and progression. overall, the downregulation of actins upon cla supplementation would affect both the contractile apparatus and the cytoskeleton with a final effect on cell motility. however its relationship with the development of the immune system remains unclear. deficiencies in proteins that regulate the cortical actin cytoskeleton have increasingly been associated with immunodeficiency and autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease, indicating a critical role for these regulators in immune response and tolerance .

besides the modulatory action of cla found on the above node genes, other genes with importance on the immune system were differentially modulated and would require further studies. this is the case of for the receptors for interleukin- <dig>  and chemokines  which are involved in mucosal immune responses and chemotaxis, respectively  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, by using rat whole genome microarrays, we determined the changes in gene expression induced by an 80: <dig> c <dig> t11:t <dig> c <dig> cla mix in mln from suckling rats. the generation of a biological association network allowed the identification of specific node genes that might be involved in immune responses. we conclude that ctgf, timp <dig>  gal and syt <dig>  among others, are gene target candidates modulated by cla which may explain the effect of this pufa on mucosal immune responses in early life.
