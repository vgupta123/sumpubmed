BACKGROUND
domestic sunflower  is native to north america  <cit>  and widely cultivated as oilseed and confection crop types. besides being economically important, sunflower also serves as model in ecological and evolutionary studies  <cit> . a major focus in both public and private sunflower breeding programs has been to develop sunflower hybrid varieties with improved yield, oil content and resistance to a wide range of diseases. breeding new hybrids by conventional practices mostly is slow and uncertain; however, application of molecular markers can improve efficiency of plant selection, saving time and providing accuracy in a breeding program  <cit> . a wide range of molecular markers such as rflp, aflp, ssr and trap developed in sunflower have successfully enabled construction of high density genetic maps  <cit>  and led to identification of molecular markers linked to disease resistance genes  <cit> . however, in general, practical usage of these markers for routine breeding purposes is limited due to high assay cost, low reproducibility, and lack of qtl validation studies  <cit> .

in recent years, snp markers have gained popularity in crop breeding programs due to their low cost, high throughput efficiency, and abundance. particularly in association mapping studies, snps are the preferred marker type since they involves scanning whole genomes with extremely high marker densities to identify closely linked markers to causal polymorphisms  <cit> . it is estimated that due to low linkage disequilibrium and high haplotype diversity, snps in the order of several thousand would be needed to successfully conduct genome wide association analysis in sunflower  <cit> .

large-scale discovery of genome-wide distributed snps can be effectively conducted with the aid of massively parallel, next-generation sequencing  technologies  <cit> . several studies that involve whole genome sequencing  efforts have led to the successful discovery of snps in arabidopsis  <cit> , humans  <cit> , and medicago  <cit> . ngs technologies have also been extended for snp discovery in large and complex genomes that lack an assembled reference genome  <cit> . a common approach in these situations is the use of a complexity reduction strategy that is designed to selectively interrogate a small percentage of the target genome  <cit> . by restricting sequencing on a smaller fraction of the genome, overall sequencing costs are reduced compared to wgs strategies, while still identifying a large amount of genetic variation. for instance, by using an rna sequencing approach  on tissues from two diverse maize inbred lines, more than  <dig> snps associated with  <dig>  genes were identified and validated  <cit> . similarly, previous work in sunflower produced nearly  <dig>  snps with rna-seq  <cit> .

in addition, a cadre of methods have been developed that involve the usage of restriction enzymes on genomic dna for complexity reduction. these strategies can be at the nucleotide level and are viewed as simple and highly efficient methods in plant and animal genome sequencing studies. one such method, crops  can overcome the problems associated with highly duplicated regions in complex genomes that hamper the process of snp identification  <cit> . restriction site-associated dna sequencing  is an emerging method for snp detection in genomes and is based on identifying polymorphic variants adjacent to restriction enzyme digestion sites  <cit> . application of rad-seq for identifying genetic variants has been demonstrated in a variety of species with and without an available reference genome  <cit> . more recently paired-end rad-seq  has been used in a variety of efforts for both genome assembly and snp marker development  <cit> .

furthermore, rad-seq approach has also been exploited in wide range of other studies such as association mapping  <cit> , population genetics inferences  <cit> , genetic mapping  <cit>  and in estimation of allele frequencies  <cit> . rad-seq differs from rna-seq in that non-transcribed loci are also sequenced, thus affording us an opportunity to broaden the known snps in sunflower to include those outside of transcribed regions. here we demonstrate the use of paired-end rad sequencing to enable efficient, cost-effective, high throughput marker development in h. annuus, a major oil crop without an assembled genome sequence. results on the use of this sequence resource for detection of sequence variation and design of snp marker panels for illumina infinium genotyping technology  are also discussed.

RESULTS
paired-end rad-seq and de novo assembly
unlike randomized short-insert ngs sequencing methods, rad genome fragments share a unique architecture: a sequence anchored by the restriction enzyme cleavage site and a variable sequence end generated from a shearing step during library construction . when rad is coupled with paired-end sequencing approaches now available on ngs platforms, the opposite ends of the rad fragment are linked in cis and the fragment can then be interrogated. mate-pairs with identical single read sequences can then be readily assembled into contigs spanning hundreds of base pairs .

to promote snp identification in low-copy, gene-rich regions of the  <dig>  gbp sunflower genome, a species expected to contain upwards of 80% retrotransposon content  <cit> , the 5-methylcytosine  sensitive type ii nuclease psti  was selected for rad-seq in each of the six lines. numerous studies have documented retroelement-dense regions of plant genome are often subjected to cytosine methylation of cpg, cpnpg and cpnpn nucleotides  <cit> . restriction enzymes such as psti, which do not cleave 5mc-modified dna, have been shown to specifically sample the hypomethylated genomic fraction of plant genomes  <cit> .

sequencing results for each of the six lines are detailed in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  m reads  were obtained from all six lines, representing ~ <dig>  gb of sequence data. an overall workflow of sequence analysis performed in this study is encapsulated in figure  <dig>  to construct a skeleton sunflower reference, reads from line rha  <dig>  <cit>  were first coalesced into contigs using the velvet assembler  <cit> . initial de novo assembly produced ~ <dig>  mb of sunflower genome sequence distributed over  <dig>  individual contigs. this quantity of assembled sequence data is approximately half of the sequence content developed from a contemporary whole transcriptome sequencing project  <cit> . contig lengths for the rha assembly ranged between  <dig> and 920 bp with an n <dig> length of 393 bp for all rha  <dig> assemblies . the contig length distribution is in line with the fragment size range selected during rad-seq library preparation. after initial assembly, contigs were aligned against a custom sequence database to remove sequences with significant plastid homology with  <dig>  contigs spanning  <dig>  mbp of the sunflower genome remaining. contigs passing these filters were then evaluated for the presence of repetitive elements using the repeatmasker web server with the arabidopsis repbase library. the percentage of the rad-seq rha  <dig> assembly classified as repetitive by repeatmasker was  <dig> %. this is consistent with a genome assembly principally from low-copy regions, as the  <dig>  gigabasepair sunflower genome is expected to contain over 80% repetitive nucleotide content. the major classes of repetitive dna elements that were identified belonged to low complexity sequences and ty/copia long-terminal repeat  retroelement families . the gc dinucleotide content for rha  <dig> sunflower assembles was  <dig> % , which is consistent with results from paired-end rad-seq studies in other plant genomes  <cit> .

comparison of rad-seq assemblies from rha  <dig> to preexisting sunflower unigenes at the dana farber cancer institute  confirmed high sequence identity between rad assemblies and known sunflower genomic sequences. a representative alignment is shown in additional file  <dig> illustrating the match of a single paired-end rad-seq contig with tentative consensus est tc <dig> from the h. annuus dfci est database. the high sequence coverage inherent in paired-end rad-seq minimizes sequencing and assembly errors, as each nucleotide in the contig is derived from the consensus of many overlapping illumina sequence reads. experimental paired-end rad-seq studies using the sequenced b <dig> maize cultivar have placed the single base accuracy for paired-end rad-seq contigs at approximately  <dig> % . this accuracy in rad-seq contig assembly is a key advantage for applications involving genome assembly and downstream marker development.

snp discovery
alignment of sequence data from all six sunflower inbred lines to the rha  <dig> reference used the bowtie/samtools  <cit>  variant detection pipeline and revealed the presence of  <dig>  putative sunflower snps . the calculated polymorphism rate in this study is approximately one snp observed per 143 bp of sunflower genomic sequence. this rate of nucleotide variation agrees well with the levels of genetic diversity reported in recent sunflower studies  <cit> . several additional filtering steps were implemented to pare down the initial snp dataset to a panel of markers suitable for infinium genotyping. the full set of  <dig>  potential variant loci was scored over the sunflower population. although snp genotypes could be reliably called for over 79% of loci ,  <dig>  snps with missing genotype calls in three or more sunflower lines were not considered for further analysis . genotypes for the remaining  <dig>  alleles indicated  <dig> % of genotype calls were homozygous in the target population, in line with the inbred nature of the selected lines. the large tracts of sequence landscape generated around candidate snps foster the conversion of variants identified from rad-seq into downstream genotyping platforms such as the illumina goldengate, infinium and sequenom iplex systems. of the  <dig>  candidate snps, less than 4% had to be removed due to the absence of insufficient flanking genomic sequence . the vast majority of discarded snps were rejected due to the presence of flanking polymorphisms within 50 bp that can interfere with oligo hybridization during genotyping . a final set of  <dig>  snps was identified and considered for infinium genotyping design.

analysis of the sequence variation identified in rad-seq aligns well with values reported in other plant studies. first, the observed snp transition/transversion ratio of  <dig>   in this study is very similar to the distributions reported in other studies of sunflower and eggplant  <cit> . analysis of the location of variants in assembled rha  <dig> contigs indicated no significant bias in allele detection: most snps were identified between  <dig> and 300 bp from the start of each contig . finally, approximately 57% of all assembled contigs  contained at least one detectable polymorphism, reflecting the high degree of variation present in sunflower .

CONCLUSIONS
the application of next-generation dna sequencing to generate large numbers of genetic markers has revolutionized plant breeding, facilitating both molecular genetic research and marker-assisted selection efforts. we have demonstrated paired-end rad-seq is an efficient and cost-effective means of snp discovery in a species with a complex, highly repetitive genome. from less than a flowcell of illumina paired-end sequence data we sequenced six diverse sunflower lines, assembled over  <dig>  high-quality sequence contigs with an n <dig> contig length of  <dig> nucleotides, mined more than  <dig>  sequence variations from the sunflower genome and identified  <dig>  candidate snps suitable for downstream genotyping. the rad-seq method is appropriate for studies where many thousands of snps need to be rapidly identified at a low cost, in a format suitable for high-throughput genotyping.
