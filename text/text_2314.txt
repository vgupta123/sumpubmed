BACKGROUND
stroke is among the leading causes of neurological disability and has a devastating emotional and financial burden on stroke survivors and their families  <cit> . the only treatment currently available is thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator . however, due to the limited time window for treatment  and the rigorous inclusion criteria, less then 5% of stroke patients are eligible for tpa treatment  <cit> . unfortunately, there are no other efficient therapies to ameliorate the resulting neurodegeneration caused be cerebral ischemia. recent studies have shown that intranasal administration of insulin-like growth factor-i  is neuroprotective in animal stroke models  <cit> . other administration methods that deliver drugs systemically depend on the breakdown of the blood–brain barrier , however, this is not a predictable event in the ischemic brain  <cit> . therefore, it is unreasonable to rely on the breakdown of the bbb to administer intravascular drugs as neurological therapeutics. in contrast, intranasal administration circumvents the bbb and is capable of directly transporting drugs  <cit>  and even cells  <cit>  into the central nervous system  via transcellular pathways  <cit> , among them igf-i  <cit> . however, the underlying mechanism for intranasal igf-i uptake from the nasal cavity and its delivery to the injury site are still unknown  <cit> .

a strong candidate suggested for the mediation of exogenous igf-i is the insulin-like growth factor binding protein  family  <cit> . igfbps are highly conserved among mammalian species and are essential to igf-i’s normal function as they are crucial regulators of igf-i bioavailability, transportation and localization  <cit> . furthermore, igfbps are present in both human  <cit>  and rat  <cit>  olfactory epithelia and olfactory bulb making it a likely candidate for the uptake of igf-i from the nasal cavity and its transportation across the olfactory bulb to the injury site. studies that use des-igf-i, an analogue of igf-i that has a weak affinity for igfbps, show that administration of des-igf-i into the lateral cerebral ventricle of rats following hypoxic-ischemic injury did not decrease neuronal loss, whereas igf-i significantly reduced neuronal loss when compared to the vehicle treated group  <cit> . this suggests that igf-i requires igfbps to carry out its neuroprotective functions.

among the igfbps present in the cns, igfbp- <dig> is essential in elucidating the mechanism behind igf-i delivery. even though the overall igfbp- <dig> levels decrease after initial stages of development, it remains to be the most abundant igfbp in the cns  <cit> . interestingly, igf-i has high binding affinity for igfbp- <dig>  but this affinity greatly decreases when igfbp- <dig> binds to cell surface proteins  <cit> . this decrease in affinity causes igfbp- <dig> to release igf-i in close proximity of igf-i receptors  on the cellular surface. this interaction is thought to play a significant role in igf-i localization to its receptor  <cit>  and could also play a role in the initiation of the anti-apoptotic signaling cascade  <cit> .

furthermore, high levels of igfbp- <dig> mrna have been detected in major sites of igf-i production in the adult rodent brain, such as the olfactory bulb  <cit> . it has also been shown that igfbp- <dig> mrna levels increase after hypoxic-ischemic injury to the brain  <cit> , and that igfbp- <dig> mrna co-localizes with endogenous igf-i at the injury site  <cit> .

despite data suggesting a role for igfbp- <dig> in endogenous and exogenous igf-i triggered neuroprotection, studies on igfbp- <dig> currently have been limited to mrna levels and in situ hybridization, with no indication of the actual protein levels and distribution. therefore, the objective of this study was to determine how ischemic injury may effect igfbp- <dig> protein levels in the mouse brain, particularly in the stroke penumbra, the main target of neuroprotective treatments  <cit> . animal studies have shown that the effective treatment window for stroke is 3–6 h, yet they have also shown that later time points contribute to recovery via neurogenesis, angiogenesis and overall tissue repair  <cit> . however, the majority of stroke patients do not arrive at the hospital within the treatment window, and most clinical trials continue with the neuroprotective treatment they are analyzing for a few days after the initial administration  <cit> . these factors make it essential to establish the distribution and concentration of any neuroprotectant and its potential carriers past the acute phase. in the current study we chose to explore igfbp- <dig> expression and distribution in the brain in the chronic phases of stroke  <cit> , which would help elucidate if there is potential for further protection/repair of the neuron population and remodeling of the penumbra and core. since intranasal administration is shown to be the most effective route for igf-i mediated neuroprotection, we have also analyzed the olfactory epithelia and the olfactory bulb for igfbp- <dig> levels and investigated the role of igfbps in transportation of intranasally administered igf-i. our results indicate that igfbp- <dig> and igf-i distribution drastically changes after hypoxic-ischemic injury and transportation of igf-i from the nasal cavity to the brain is likely mediated by igfbps, and not the igf-ir.

RESULTS
igfbp- <dig> in ischemic cortical neurons and astrocytes
first, we determined how ischemic conditions could affect igfbp- <dig> in vitro. primary neuron or astrocyte cultures were subjected to 1 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation  followed by 24 h of re-oxygenation to mimic ischemic stroke. the cells were then fixed and co-labeled with igfbp- <dig> and/or microtubule-associated protein  <dig>  or glial fibrillary acidic protein  antibodies. interestingly, under control conditions, the neurons expressed a small amount of igfbp- <dig> that appeared to be only in the cells extensions . after ogd, igfbp- <dig> was seen throughout the cell body. in astrocytes under control conditions, igfbp- <dig> immunoreactivity was seen mainly around the nucleus . however, this changes in reactive astrocytes after ogd, in which igfbp- <dig> is expressed throughout the entire cell body.

igfbp- <dig> and igf-i in mouse brain
we characterized igfbp- <dig> in the olfactory bulb, cortex and cerebellum in control mice by western blot and elisa . igfbp- <dig> protein was found to be most abundant in the olfactory bulb and was present in cortex and cerebellum in control animals. next, we wanted to document the change in igfbp- <dig> protein levels following hypoxic-ischemic injury. first, we explored the expression of igfbp- <dig> in neurons, astrocytes and microglia in brain sections of mice that underwent 1 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion . images were taken of cells in the cortex that formed the penumbra. compared to sham animals, both neurons and astrocytes show an increase in expression of igfbp- <dig> . we did not detect any immunoreactivity in microglia in either the sham or mcao groups . using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , we measured igfbp- <dig> and igf-i protein levels in the stroke brain. sham and mcao mice were sacrificed at 24 h or 72 h time points. the brains were removed and stained with ttc to visualize the penumbra. tissue from the penumbra and stroke core was collected as shown in figure  <dig>  the olfactory bulb and cerebellum were also collected. there was no detectible difference in igfbp- <dig> levels between the left and right hemisphere of sham mice after 24 h  and 72 h . igfbp- <dig> levels increased after 24 h in stroke animals compared to sham animals, but there was no significant difference in olfactory bulb, penumbra and core igfbp- <dig> levels between the contralateral and stroke hemispheres . however, 72 h post-stroke, igfbp- <dig> levels significantly increased in the stroke penumbra  and core  when compared to the contralateral hemisphere . igf-i levels in sham animals were not significantly different between the left and the right hemispheres for the brain regions analyzed. igf-i was not detectable in the cortex at 24 h or 72 h  or in the cerebellum at 72 h . igf-i levels increased 24 h post-stroke in the penumbra and core, but remained highest in the olfactory bulb . within 72 h, igf-i levels were significantly higher at the stroke core when compared with contralateral hemisphere and also with the other brain regions .

role of igfbps in intranasal transportation
we investigated whether igfbps are required for the uptake of intranasally administered igf-i into the cns. desigf-i, a potent igf-i analog  <cit> , can bind to the igf-ir but cannot bind to igfbps  <cit> . we used the selective binding capability of desigf-i to identify whether igf-i uptake in the olfactory bulb requires igf-ir or igfbps. we hypothesized that if igf-i uptake into the olfactory bulb is mediated by igf-ir, pre-incubation with desigf-i would occupy all receptor-binding sites and significantly reduce the uptake of 125i-igf-i into the brain. desigf-i pre-incubation was not capable of blocking the uptake of subsequently applied 125i-igf-i into the brain . also, pre-incubation with 125i-igf-i and immediate application of a molar excess of desigf-i did not affect 125i-igf-i uptake into the brain. however, pre-incubation with unlabeled igf-i was capable of outcompeting 125i-igf-i, in presence and absence of desigf-i.

discussion
igfbp- <dig> & igf-i protein levels in mouse brain
the 5-fold increase of the igfbp- <dig> protein levels in the penumbra has two implications. it confirms the previous mrna data and further demonstrates that the increase changes the distribution pattern of igfbp- <dig> in control vs. stroke conditions . this region specific change in the protein distribution is particularly important as increased levels of igfbp- <dig> in untreated animals in the penumbra indicates a possible neuroprotective role for endogenous igfbp- <dig>  this role is most likely associated with its regulation of igf-i, and we show that igf-i distribution in the brain changes in a pattern similar to igfbp- <dig>  igf-i mrna expression is detectable in many brain regions during embryogenesis, such as the spinal cord, midbrain, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb  <cit> . however, igf-i transcription decreases significantly postnatally and reaches very low levels in the adult  <cit> , with the exception of the olfactory bulb, where igf-i expression persists at a high level throughout life  <cit> . we show that initially igf-i is highly expressed in the olfactory bulb but is not detectable in other brain regions; however, within 72 h post-stroke it becomes increasingly abundant in the stroke core and penumbra . such an increase in igf-i levels in the stroke penumbra further supports the hypothesis that igf-i is an integral part of the brain’s endogenous response to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury  <cit>  and that igfbp- <dig> also has a function in this response. another region specific change of protein levels occurs in the stroke core where a significant increase of igf-i and igfbp- <dig> levels is observed. this might be due to igfbp- <dig> being freed from its cell surface interactions with the necrotic cells. even though the neurons in the stroke core are less likely to benefit from igf-i, it might also be used to create a pool for igf-i. such a pool would be especially beneficial to the cells that are positioned in proximity to the necrotic  border of the penumbra as it would provide these cells with a source for the neuroprotective factor igf-i. here, igf-i can exert neuroprotection by initiating the akt pathway and preventing neuronal apoptosis  <cit> .

role of igfbps in intranasal transport
in order to investigate the role of igfbps in the uptake of igf-i from intranasal cavity into the cns, we used the selective binding capability of des igf-i  <cit> . we hypothesized that if igf-i uptake into the olfactory bulb is mediated by igf-ir, pre-incubation or co-incubation with des igf-i would compete for and occupy all the receptor-binding sites and significantly reduce the uptake of 125i-igf-i  into the brain. our results indicate that such competition for the receptor does not affect labeled igf-i uptake, entailing that igf-i uptake is facilitated by another mechanism. this hypothesis is further supported by our finding that pre-incubation with unlabeled igf-i, which binds to igfbps and igf-ir, significantly reduced labeled igf-i in the brain . taken together, the results suggest the uptake of intranasal igf-i is not receptor mediated and is most likely facilitated by igfbps. the significance of this finding is its potential link to drug delivery methods. currently the prominent method is the systemic administration which relies on the unpredictable and unreliable permeabilization of the bbb  <cit> . however, relying on the breakdown of the bbb for access to the brain tissue is highly variable  <cit> . therefore, exploration of alternative delivery methods, such as those involving binding protein mediated routes, might offer a more reliable and quick access to the brain tissue.

an overview of igfbp- <dig> in acute neuroprotection and long term recovery
igfbp- <dig> has been widely studied in cancer research, where it was shown to be both inhibiting and stimulating for igf-i linked tumor growth  <cit> . in the interpretation of igfbps role in hypoxic-ischemic injury a duality similar to the one observed in cancer research exists. there are several studies that demonstrated that igfbps antagonize igf-i and limit its neuroprotective potential  <cit> . however, there are also studies that documented that igfbp binding is essential for the igf-i mediated neuroprotection  <cit> . even though igfbp- <dig> binding to igf-i decreases igf-i bioavailability, it also increases igf-i half-life. this could be especially important if part of the brain’s endogenous response to hypoxic-ischemic injury involves transportation of igf-i from other regions. the possibility for transportation is supported by our finding that igfbp- <dig> and igf-i distribution changes after stroke. while their levels are still high in the olfactory bulb, they become more abundant at the injury site. whether this is due to local upregulation or transportation, presence of igfbp- <dig> at the penumbra in itself is noteworthy. as described before  <cit>  damage due to stroke is not uniform across the cortex. stroke core can be defined as the areas where perfusion is completely absent during occlusion, resulting in necrotic tissue. stroke penumbra, on the other hand, receives limited perfusion during occlusion. cells in the penumbra have the potential to survive if treated, which in turn might improve the neurological and behavioral outcome post-stroke. therefore, treatment studies utilizing igf-i should focus on delivering the neuroprotectant to the stroke penumbra. it is at this point that igfbp- <dig> might take the center stage by binding to igf-i at the point of delivery or endogenous expression, protecting it from degradation, facilitating its transportation to the injury site and finally delivering igf-i to its target. furthermore, dominance of igfbp- <dig> as the most abundant igfbp in the olfactory bulb and its presence in the olfactory epithelia qualifies igfbp- <dig> as a candidate for facilitating this uptake. this is supported by our finding that intranasally administered igf-i most likely uses a currently uncharacterized igfbp-mediated transport system to reach the brain. this also indicates that a similar pathway/system might exist for endogenous igf-i transportation to the injury site as an endogenous response to brain injury.

since our time points include the chronic phases of stroke, it is imperative to discuss the impact of the igf system on the late remodeling of the injury site and surrounding tissue. we know from both human and animal studies  <cit> , neuroprotective therapies for stroke are most effective within a 3–6 h time window after the initial insult  <cit>  and that by 72 h, the size of the core stabilizes. even if the igf system still functions to stabilize the penumbra and delay and/or prevent neuronal death up to 24–48 h, there must be alternative explanations for their continuous upregulation up to 72 h after stroke. igf-i has already been shown to be involved in neurovascular remodeling and neuroplasticity in penumbra and core at later time points  <cit> . we suggest that igfbp- <dig> might also have an igf-i dependent and independent role in such structural changes that occur in the chronic phases. this explanation would also support in situ hybridization studies where igfbp- <dig> is found to localize with activated astrocytes and microglia  <cit> . even though astrocyte and microglia proliferation, resulting in glial scarring, is known to be detrimental to neuronal survival, these cell types are also known to be associated with post-stroke angiogenesis and neurogenesis via expression of other proteins  <cit> . hence their pro and anti-recovery roles need to be in balance  <cit> . igf-i  and igfbp- <dig>  might play a role in restoring such balance. since tissue remodeling is a long term process  <cit> , lasting increase in igfbp- <dig> protein levels might be related to recovery mechanisms employed by various cell types in the cns.

in the current paper we have provided data that intranasal igf-i uptake is not igf-ir mediated and showed that igfbp- <dig> is present in the olfactory tissue, making it a likely candidate for transporting the intranasally administered igf-i into the brain. however, no direct link has been established for igfbp-2′s transport function of igf-i into the stroke penumbra. therefore, further competition experiments designed specifically towards igfbp- <dig> are required to clarify igfbp-2′s role. similarly, igf-i independent role of igfbp- <dig> after stroke, needs to be further investigated using igfbp- <dig> inhibition experiments. such studies will clarify the acute function of igfbp- <dig> in neuroprotection and also its long-term role in tissue recovery following a stroke event.

CONCLUSIONS
the current results and the previous studies strongly suggest igfbp-2′s role in hypoxic-ischemic injury needs to be explored further  <cit> . igf-i is a promising neuroprotectant considered to be beneficial for not only stroke but a diverse array of neurological diseases such amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  and traumatic brain injury  <cit> . therefore, any insight into its mediation will allow us to take advantage of the brain’s existing neuroprotective and remodeling mechanisms. establishing these mechanisms will in turn result in more effective treatments that incorporate improved administration methods and better dose regulation.
