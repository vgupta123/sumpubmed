BACKGROUND
autotaxin , also known as phosphodiesterase-i alpha  or ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase  <dig> , is overexpressed in various tumors, including gastric cancer, ovarian cancer  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit> . atx has lysophospholipase d  activity, which converts lysophosphatidylcholine  into lysophosphatidic acid   <cit> . lpa levels have been reported to be elevated in diverse physiological and pathological conditions including pregnancy, high cholesterol diet, and ovarian cancer  <cit> . the biological outcome of atx activity depends on the local availability of its substrate lpc  <cit> . the atx-lpa signaling axis has been implicated in angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, fibrotic diseases and tumor progression, making this system an attractive target for therapy  <cit> . lpa elicits a variety of cellular biological responses through lpa receptors, which are a family of seven-transmembrane g protein-coupled receptors , including lpa <dig>  lpa <dig>  lpa <dig>  and lpa <dig>  <cit> . lpa1-lpa <dig> receptors are expressed in various combinations in almost every tissue throughout the body, while lpa <dig> receptor is not widely expressed in human tissues  <cit> . lpa enhances the migration of gastric cancer cells by mediating the location of rhoa  <cit> .

osteopontin , a glycophosphoprotein cytokine, plays an important role in both physiological and pathological processes, such as cell adhesion, chemotaxis, protection of apoptosis, invasion and migration  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that opn is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues compared to their surrounding gastric mucosa tissues  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the relationship between atx-lpa axis and opn in the human gastric cancer cell line, sgc <dig> cells.

RESULTS
lpa and atx/lpc induced opn expression in sgc <dig> cells
we first investigated the relationship between opn and the atx-lpa axis by examining the expression of opn in sgc <dig> cells treated with or without atx, lpc, lpa, and atx/lpc. figure 1a shows a time course of opn stimulation utilizing atx  + lpc   and a better time point of  <dig> hours. we found that lpa, atx/lpc <dig> and atx/lpc <dig> induced an increase in opn expression in both protein  and mrna  levels. however, atx or lpc alone did not induce significant changes in opn expression, suggesting that the increased opn expression was induced by lpa, which was converted by atx and lpc. compared to non-treated cells, opn expression induced by lpa, atx/lpc <dig> and atx/lpc <dig> was  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively in protein levels ; and  <dig> -fold in mrna levels  .

atx/lpc-regulated opn expression was mediated by lpa <dig> receptor and activation of akt and mapk/erk
to determine whether the lpa receptor is responsible for lpa signal transduction, sgc <dig> cells were treated with atx, lpc, lpa, atx/lpc <dig> for  <dig> hours, and the expression of lpa receptors was detected by real time-pcr. our results suggest that the expression of lpa <dig>  lpa <dig>  lpa <dig> and lpa <dig> receptors were all found in sgc <dig> cells. however, the expression of the lpa <dig> receptor was increased upon treatment with atx/lpc <dig>  suggesting that the lpa <dig> receptor might be the predominant receptor mediating lpa-induced opn expression in sgc <dig> cells .

to further explore the mechanisms underlying lpa-induced opn expression, we focused on the mitogen activated protein kinase  and akt signaling pathways. sgc <dig> cells were treated with the reagents described above for  <dig> min, and total protein was extracted by western blot to detect phosphorylation of either erk or akt. total erk and akt levels were assessed as controls. we found that lpa and atx/lpc <dig> induced both erk and akt phosphorylation in sgc <dig> cells . we treated sgc <dig> cells with atx/lpc <dig> in the presence of various inhibitors including the lpa receptor inhibitor, ki16425; erk inhibitor, pd98059; and pi3kinase inhibitor, ly <dig> to examine the involvement of the lpa receptor, akt and erk in lpa or atx/lpc2-induced opn expression. our results indicated that atx/lpc-induced opn expression in sgc <dig> cells was largely reduced by the previously mentioned inhibitors , suggesting that atx/lpc-induced opn expression is mediated by the lpa <dig> receptor as well as the activation of erk and akt.

determination of elk- <dig> activities in sgc <dig> cells
transfection of sgc <dig> cells with either the pfr-luc plasmid , or the pfa2-elk <dig> plasmid  allowed us to gain a better understanding of the atx-opn signaling pathways. cells were then treated with atx/lpc <dig>  dmso, ki <dig>  pd <dig>  and ly <dig>  luciferase activity of pfa2-elk1stimulated by atx/lpc <dig> was approximately  <dig>  folds higher compared with that of the non-treated control cells. nevertheless, in the presence of ki <dig>  pd <dig>  or ly <dig>  the pfa2-elk <dig> activities induced by atx/lpc <dig> were reduced by  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively . these reductions showed convincing evidence that the lpa receptor, erk, and akt were partially required in these processes.

requirement of opn in migration induced by the atx-lpa axis protected against taxol-induced apoptosis in sgc <dig> cells
we established opn-deficient sgc <dig> cell lines through the introduction of opn sirna  to better understand the role of opn in the atx-lpa axis. sgc7901-vehicle was used as control. opn expression was significantly down-regulated in clone <dig>  which was then used in our study .

a transwell-migration assay was performed to further investigate the biological functions of opn knockdown in sgc <dig> cells, and to detect lpa-induced migration in sgc7901-sirna-opn cells. lpa and atx/lpc <dig> significantly promoted migrations of sgc <dig> cells from either  <dig> cells to  <dig> cells  or to  <dig> cells ; from either  <dig> cells to  <dig> cells  or to  <dig> cells  in sgc7901-sirna-neg cells; however, no significant effect was found on the migrations of sgc7901-sirna-opn cells, from either  <dig> cells to  <dig> cells  or to  <dig> cells  , suggesting that opn is required in the migration of sgc <dig> cells induced by lpa or atx/lpc.

atx has been reported to protect taxol-induced apoptosis in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells and mda-mb- <dig> melanoma cells  <cit> . we investigated whether the atx-lpa axis also protected against taxol-induced apoptosis in sgc <dig> cells. using flow cytometry, we found that treatment of sgc <dig> cells with  <dig> nm taxol resulted in a 64% increase in apoptosis. in comparing with the controls, either lpa alone, or atx/lpc <dig> inhibited taxol-induced apoptosis to  <dig> %  or 21%  in sgc <dig> cells. interestingly, in sgc7901-sirna-opn cells , lpa or atx/lpc <dig> inhibited taxol-induced apoptosis to 37%  or  <dig> %  . the protective effect of lpa decreased to  <dig> %. these results suggested that opn is required in each of the processes and either lpa or atx/lpc had a significant protective effect against taxol-induced apoptosis.

discussion
gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer in developing countries, including china  <cit> . many molecular events are responsible for the initiation of gastric cancer and its progression. atx, an extracellular lysopld, that catalyzes the conversion from lpc to lpa, exerts various biological effects through the lipid-signaling molecule, lpa  <cit> . opn was shown to be frequently overexpressed in many human cancers, including lung cancer  <cit> , colorectal cancer  <cit>  and stomach cancer. opn has been demonstrated to promote the survival of gastric cancer sgc <dig> cells in the condition of cellular stresses induced by serum withdrawal or curcumin treatment  <cit> . although several lines of evidence have suggested that the atx-lpa axis and opn can be used as tumor markers, the relationship between atx and opn is still not clear. in this study, we observed that lpa, atx/lpc induced opn expression , and opn were required for the effect of the atx-lpa axis on the human gastric cancer sgc <dig> cells.

atx, lpa, and opn elicit a wide range of cellular responses, including cell proliferation and migration  <cit> . taxol, known as paclitaxel, is a very important drug to promote apoptosis  <cit> . in our present study, figure 4d showed that lpa and atx/lpc was required in the protection against taxol-induced apoptosis in sgc <dig> cells. lpa and atx/lpc also significantly promoted the migration of sgc <dig> cells, but had no significant effects on the migration of opn-deficient sgc <dig> cells , suggesting that opn was indispensable for atx/lpc-induced migration and opn was required in the protective effect against taxol-induced apoptosis in sgc <dig> cells. it is likely that atx generates lpa from lpc and then lpa displays protective effect on these cells, which requires further studies.

lpa mediates its activity through a series of g protein-coupled receptors  <cit> . many gastric cancer cell lines have been shown to express at least one lpa receptor  <cit> . in our study, expression of the lpa <dig> receptor was up-regulated by atx/lpc <dig> , consistent with previous results that ovarian cancers showed markedly increased expression of lpa <dig> receptors  <cit> . although ki <dig>  is somewhat lpa-receptor specific with the order of inhibition of lpa <dig> > lpa <dig> >> lpa <dig>  data from our experiment revealed that lpa <dig> possibly played more important roles in the process of atx/lpc2- induced expression of opn.

the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase  and pi3k/akt signaling pathways are evolutionarily conserved kinase modules that link extracellular signals to the machinery controlled fundamental cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis; all are critical in human malignancies. in our study, phosphorylation of erk and akt were upregulated by atx/lpc and lpa, and down-regulated by their inhibitors, pd <dig> and ly <dig>  our data clearly indicated that lpa-induced overexpression of opn was mediated by either pi3k/akt or erk signaling pathways. erk activates different transcription factors related to cell proliferation and survival such as elk- <dig>  as a major substrate of the mapk family, elk- <dig> plays a key role in cell differentiation, proliferation, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. phosphorylation of elk- <dig> appears to be critical for the activation of c-fos transcription  <cit> . our results proposed that elk- <dig> connected the intracellular signaling cascade of atx-lpa2-opn .

CONCLUSIONS
our overall results provided novel evidence that the atx-lpa axis induces opn expression via akt and mapk/erk-mediated mechanisms, and opn is required in migration induced by atx-lpa axis, which protects against taxol-induced apoptosis in sgc <dig> cells.
