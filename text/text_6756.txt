BACKGROUND
the advent and progress made in the last two decades of dna based molecular markers has contributed to the generation of dense genetic maps  <cit> . new technologies like next generation sequencing  have made possible the high throughput identification and genotyping of thousands of molecular markers in a relatively short time and potentially at a low cost  <cit> . a fast cost-effective approach to next-generation molecular marker discovery called genotyping by sequencing , has been proposed to reduce the turnaround time significantly and increases the availability of thousands of snp  molecular markers evenly distributed throughout the genome  <cit> .

high-density genetic maps built using snps derived from the gbs approach have been reported in important crop species such as barley  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , rice  <cit> , raspberry  <cit>  and cotton  <cit> . in non model crops, new technologies as gbs have not been widely used so far. however in cassava, one of the most highly dense genetic maps was created using gbs-based snps, for mapping the resistance to cassava mosaic geminiviruses  <cit> .

cassava  belongs to the euphorbiaceae family, which includes approximately  <dig>  species  <cit> . botanically it is a tropical perennial shrub whose origin center is the amazon basin  <cit> . cassava typically is a diploid species   <cit>  highly heterozygous and vegetative propagation through stakes in agriculture. cassava is important for food security in tropical regions of the world. it represents an important source for calories for more than one billion of people  <cit> . the species tolerates drought and has been considered as a well adapted crop facing climate change which could position it as one of the best alternatives for providing food for the rapidly growing world population in future  <cit> .

cassava is cultivated in more than  <dig> countries and its leaves and roots can be consumed as food and feed  <cit> . the plant has also important industrial uses, mainly for its low-cost starch which finds a diverse range of applications  <cit> . for many decades the use of cassava was limited to subsistence of farmers, but since several years is becoming increasingly important for agro-processing industries mainly due to its biofuel potential  <cit> . despite the fact that cassava is one of the major crops in the world, a decade ago this crop was listed as one of the least studied plant species  <cit> . the employment of modern molecular tools will help to go deeper in the understanding of the genetic basis and even lead to the identification and cloning of genes controlling agro-economic importance traits. most of the genes characterized so far in model and cultivated plants have been cloned employing map based cloning approach  <cit> . the application of this strategy requires the development of high resolution genetic maps  <cit> . the lack of these maps has hampered so far the cloning of interesting genes in cassava  <cit> .

while in genetic maps, markers, genes or loci are ordered based on recombination frequencies at meiosis  <cit> , physical maps present ordered fragments of cloned genomic dna fragments and whose sizes and distances are given in base pairs . genetic maps have considerable relevance for the construction of comprehensive physical maps. combining the relative location and order of genetic markers on a map, with their location on scaffolds or contigs allows the assembly of these fragments into a genome-wide physical map  <cit> .

the current draft of the cassava genome sequence  is publicly available at the jgi’s phytozome v <dig> platform and it was obtained by a whole genome shotgun  strategy  <cit> , using  <dig> life sciences technology. the cassava genome assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds span a total of  <dig>  mb  <cit> . however, based on nuclear dna quantity, it has been estimated that the cassava genome to be 772 mb  <cit> . strategies based on correlations between physical and genetic maps could serve as one valuable tool for subsequent identification of genes involved in interesting traits  <cit> , for genome organization studies  <cit> , assessment of genetic diversity  <cit>  and comparative genome analysis  <cit> .

one the main advantages of genetic and physical mapping is the possibility to integrate traits of interest and the corresponding function of genes  <cit> . the availability of the functional maps is of importance not only to better understand the evolution of plant species through synteny but also for marker-assisted breeding programs.

cassava, like other crops is affected by pests and diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, phytoplasms and oomycetes  <cit> . the molecular analysis of plant pathogen interactions in several model plants and crops has allowed the identification of two main branches in plant immunity depending on the receptor molecules involved  <cit> . one branch is defined on the presence of pattern recognition receptors  that are able to detect microbe-associated molecular patterns   <cit> . the prrs have conserved domains as for example leucine rich repeats , lysm and kinases  <cit> . the mamp-triggered immunity  is effective against non-adapted or non-host pathogens. some pathogens adapted to infect and colonize particular plants species, suppressing the plant mti by delivering effector proteins into the plant cytoplasm  <cit> . however, plants evolved resistance  proteins, which recognize specifically some of these effectors and trigger the second branch of immunity named race specific, gene for gene resistance, or effector triggered immunity   <cit> . the largest class of r proteins contains nb-arc  and lrr domains which can be accompanied by the presence of a tir  domain in their n-terminus.  <cit> . several studies have employed the presence of these conserved domains to identify r genes in plant genomes to gain insight about their genome organization and evolution  <cit> . the genome-wide identification of a set of classical defense-encoding sequences and their localization in a genetic map will provide insights into the diversity of genes coding for immunity-related proteins  available in cassava and also can contribute to accelerating the process of isolation and cloning of prr and/or r genes.

in the present study a new genetic map of cassava is constructed based on a population of 132 f <dig> full-sib progeny derived from a biparental cross and snp markers obtained using the gbs approach. physical mapping of scaffolds from cassava whole genome sequencing using the mapped markers as anchors is presented. furthermore we present a genome-comprehensive repertoire of cassava irps based on the presence of conserved domains. finally, more than five hundred of genes encoding for irps were unambiguously localized on the sequencing scaffolds and on the genetic map.

RESULTS
genotyping by sequencing
to identify polymorphisms the parents and the progeny of the mapping population were genotyped using the gbs approach. on average  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated for each of  <dig> samples and  <dig> , <dig> tags were obtained in total. considering that the average length of each tag was 64 bp, the total amount of dna sequence analyzed was  <dig> million base pairs. to eliminate possible false positive snps, only tags aligned to unique positions in the cassava reference genome were selected. after the alignment to the cassava genome  <cit> ,  <dig> , <dig> tags  were aligned to unique positions while  <dig>  tags  were aligned to multiple positions and the remaining  <dig>  tags  could not be aligned.

in total,  <dig>  snp markers were obtained which corresponds, on average, to one snp every  <dig>  base pairs. they are distributed across  <dig>  scaffolds from  <dig>  constituting the current cassava genome sequence draft, corresponding to 87%  of the genome. the distribution of tagged scaffolds, the number of snps representing the scaffolds and the cumulative scaffold length in base pair across the genome is shown in additional file  <dig> 

from the resulting set of  <dig>  snps,  <dig> %  of the total set of snps correspond to transitions and  <dig> %  to transversions, for a transition-transversion ratio of  <dig> . a meaningful number of snps,  <dig> % , were located in annotated cassava genome regions. of these,  <dig> %  were found within annotated cds . for non-coding regions,  <dig> %  were found within introns, 10%  within promoters and  <dig> %  within utrs .

the gene ontology  analysis was performed for  <dig>  unique cassava genome annotated sequences that contain at least one of the  <dig>  annotated snps obtained by gbs. on average, each annotated region contains three snps. in total for the three groups,  <dig>  unigenes  were obtained corresponding to the  <dig>  annotated snps. the functional group with the highest gene product counts was biological process with  <dig> %  followed by molecular function  <dig> %  and cellular component  <dig> %  .

high-density genetic map construction
the obtained  <dig>  snps were subjected to a series of selective criteria in order to choose the useful snps for the purpose of genetic mapping. from the total set of markers,  <dig>  snps  correspond to polymorphic markers in the two parents, from which  <dig>   correspond to genotypes derived from a cross between heterozygous and homozygous parents. monomorphic homogeneous  markers as well as those with missing data in more than 10% of the population individuals were excluded. after the quality control filters the number of useful and informative loci for mapping was reduced to  <dig> . more heterozygous markers were identified in the female parental than in the male. of the  <dig>  markers,  <dig>   were heterozygous only in the male parent while  <dig>   were heterozygous only in the female and  <dig>   were heterozygous for both parents. after the filtering of identical segregation and distortion for linkage analysis and map construction  <dig>  snps were taken into account to be analyzed using joinmap  <dig> . from them, the software integrated, unambiguously,  <dig>  snp markers onto the newly constructed genetic map. these were distributed in  <dig> linkage groups, which corresponds to the number of haploid cassava chromosomes   <cit> . the numbering was done according to previous studies . the pairwise recombination fractions and lod scores obtained using r/qtl indicate strong linkage for all pairs of markers on each of the  <dig> lgs .

the number of snps in each linkage group ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . the map spanned a total of  <dig>  cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between markers . the lg <dig> was the largest group, with a total length of  <dig>  cm, while the smallest was lg <dig>  with  <dig>  cm. the lg <dig> and lg <dig> were the groups with the highest marker density, with an interval of  <dig>  cm, whereas the lg <dig> was the least saturated group, with an interval of 2 cm. longer intervals were present in linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with values of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  cm respectively .figure  <dig>

comparative genetic map of cassava
the map constructed here was compared to the previously reported genetic maps  <cit> . only for the reported lg <dig> no homologous linkage group could be identified. the rest of linkage groups show high co-linearity when the markers are compared according to the corresponding scaffoldings they tag. the identities of the scaffolds shared for each lg among the maps was in the range between 52%  and 83%  with an overall average of 66% throughout all the linkage groups . in total  <dig> anchor markers between the maps were identified. the lg <dig>  and lg <dig> contain the highest anchor markers , while the lg <dig> with  <dig> markers was the lowest. on average each lg have  <dig>  anchor markers . an additional comparative analysis was done with the cassava map developed by rabbi et al.  <cit> . eight anchor markers distributed in lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> were identified .figure  <dig>

physical mapping of scaffolds in the genetic map
to orient the scaffolds of the cassava genome draft sequence into the genetic map, the mapped markers were employed as anchors. a total of  <dig> unique scaffolds were localized on the genetic map, representing  <dig> %  of the current cassava reference genome. the linkage groups with the highest number of scaffolds were lg <dig> , lg <dig> , lg <dig> and lg <dig> with  <dig> each. lg <dig> and lg <dig> have the lowest numbers of scaffolds with  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . a total of 46%  of the selected scaffolds were tagged by single-markers, 41%  were tagged by 2- <dig> snps and 13%  by more than five markers. scaffold  <dig>  has the highest count of markers with  <dig> snps in lg <dig>  only  <dig> %  of the scaffolds were present in two different linkage groups . in this way, the previously reported map  <cit>  could be enriched with  <dig> new scaffolds which were mapped in this study. these scaffolds are disturbed on  <dig> lgs and the number varied between six for lg <dig> or lg <dig> and  <dig> for lg <dig>  only for lg <dig> could not be anchored new scaffolds. in total, the physical map of cassava is extended with  <dig>  mb , which correspond to the sum of all new anchored scaffolds.

the relationship between physical and genetic distances in cassava genome was determined. for that, three representative regions were selected from different areas of the lg, one from the middle part and one for each of the distal parts. the scaffolds analyzed contain at least three snps. the overall physical map anchored analyzed comprises  <dig>  mb that corresponds to a genetic distance of 215 cm giving a mean value of  <dig>  kbp per 1 cm. however, this ratio varies strongly between the linkage groups, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kbp per 1 cm in lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively. this variability is calculated also inside of the linkage groups indicating uneven recombination events. in lg <dig>  1 cm can correspond to  <dig>  or to  <dig> kbp, whereas in lg <dig> it ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> kbp .table  <dig>

repertoire of immunity-related proteins
employing a bioinformatics approach, the cassava proteome was investigated for proteins containing the conserved domains present in prrs and r proteins. a repertoire of proteins with a complex pattern of combinations of these conserved domains was obtained . in total  <dig>  irps were identified . from them,  <dig> were classified as lrr-kinases based on the presence of leucine-rich-repeat and kinase specific domains. these proteins, also known as receptor-like kinases , which contain an extracellular lrr and a cytoplasmatic kinase domain are involved in mti pathways. seventeen putative proteins containing only the lysm domain and eleven proteins containing both the lysm and kinase domains were detected .

the cassava proteome contains  <dig> tir-nb-arc-lrr,  <dig> non-tir-nb-arc-lrr putative proteins, and two with tir-lrr domains. proteins containing only the nb-arc domain or only the tir domain were relatively well represented, with  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. proteins with an extracellular lrr domain are also known as receptor like proteins  can participate as immune receptors, while other rlps participate in plant development. the cassava proteome contains  <dig> of these rlps proteins. although the wrky domain separately is not present in any known r protein, it is present in an important family of plant transcription factors related with defense against pathogens. the cassava proteome has  <dig> wrky proteins and none of them contains additional conserved domains .

genomic organization of immunity related annotated genes
in total,  <dig> scaffolds containing genes coding for irps were identified. most of the genes,  <dig>  were localized in scaffolds containing two or more irps. however  <dig> genes  were localized in scaffolds as single genes. the scaffolds containing the highest number of annotated genes encoding for irps were  <dig> with  <dig>  and  <dig> with  <dig> . scaffold  <dig>  contains  <dig> genes all from the lrr class. three scaffolds contained ten genes:  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . interestingly, from the  <dig> annotated genes coding for putative tir-nb-arc-lrr proteins,  <dig> were grouped into only two scaffolds, one containing six genes  and the other one  containing four of these genes. the six genes in scaffold  <dig> are located in a region of just  <dig>  bp, whereas the four genes in scaffold  <dig>  cover  <dig>  bp. scaffolds  <dig>  and  <dig>  also harbor a relatively high number of genes of the nb-arc-lrr class, with six genes each. the scaffolds containing genes coding for proteins with a wrky domain harbor only one or two of this class of genes and only a few have three .

the annotation of the immunity genes in the cassava genome was performed with an ortholog cluster analysis  . arabidopsis thaliana, ricinus communis, and populus trichocarpa were selected as related species and the same pipeline employed to identify conserved domains in cassava was applied for these species. from the  <dig> putative proteins of cassava classified as lrr proteins by hmmscan,  <dig> have orthologs with lrr proteins from at least one of the other species analyzed . a cluster with  <dig> lrr family proteins was shared by all the three species. cassava shares  <dig> orthologous lrr proteins with p. trichocarpa,  <dig> with r. communis, and eight with a. thaliana . the second biggest group was the lrr-kinase family. of the  <dig> proteins lrr-kinase proteins predicted in cassava,  <dig> had an orthologous at least in one of the other plant species analyzed. there were  <dig> orthologs of lrr-kinases shared by all species . of the  <dig> wrky proteins from cassava,  <dig> have an ortholog in at least one of the other plant species analyzed and  <dig> are in a cluster in all species . in the case of the nb-arc family, all the  <dig> cassava predicted proteins had an ortholog in at least one other plant species evaluated and one protein is shared by all of the species . of the  <dig> proteins predicted in the non-tir-nb-arc-lrr family,  <dig> cassava proteins had an ortholog in at least one other analyzed species and six proteins had orthologs in all the studied species . finally, less than  <dig> orthologs are found among the analyzed species for the predicted orfs of each of the following classes: lysm, lysm-kinase, tir and tir-nb-arc-lrr .figure  <dig>

mapping of immunity related proteins
based on the cassava irp repertoire , those located on scaffolds oriented in the physical map were selected. in total,  <dig> irps were mapped,  <dig> of them  belonging to lrr class,  <dig>  to the lrr-kinase,  <dig>  to nb-arc-lrr,  <dig>  to wrky,  <dig>  to nb-arc,  <dig>  to tir-nb-arc-lrr,  <dig>  to lysm,  <dig>  to tir and  <dig>  to lysm-kinase .

these  <dig> genes coding for irps were physically located in  <dig> scaffolds and distributed in all the  <dig> linkage groups with an average of  <dig>  per linkage group. lg <dig> , lg <dig> and lg <dig> had the highest counts with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. the linkage groups with the lowest counts were lg <dig> and lg <dig> with  <dig> genes each . in total,  <dig> clusters were identified, with  <dig> genes, counting for almost 67% of the total mapped irps. clusters were found in all  <dig> linkage groups. the cluster with highest number had  <dig> irps  and was located in lg <dig>  followed by lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> with clusters of  <dig> irps each. seventy clusters, on  <dig> lgs, except for lg <dig>  have two irps each. these clusters had diverse combinations of irp classes .figure  <dig>

anchoring previous qtls for disease resistance
we searched to localize loci or qtls previously reported in our genetic or physical map. the markers ssry <dig> , s5214_ <dig> and s5214_ <dig> have been genetically associated with cmd resistance  <cit> . these markers were anchored in the scaffold  <dig>  in lg <dig>  at the same position as reported by rabbi et al.  <cit> . in this study it was possible to anchor the markers ssrns <dig> and ssrns <dig> previously associated with cmd resistance  <cit>  in the scaffold  <dig> , while in the scaffolds  <dig>  and  <dig> , localized in the lg <dig>  were anchored the markers ssrns <dig> and ssry <dig> where a qtl for cmd resistance have been reported  <cit> . interestingly, from these scaffolds, the  <dig>  and  <dig> , one  and five genes  coding for irps are present . a fine mapping and/or association studies will allow if these candidate genes are directly related to cmd resistance.

discussion
in this work a gbs approach was carried out to identify snp derived markers in a cassava population for genetic and physical mapping purposes. the  <dig>  gbs-snps obtained cover 87%  of the current cassava genome sequence. these markers were distributed homogenously through  <dig>  scaffolds of the genome sequence draft. these scaffolds cover the majority of the cassava genome, although they represent  <dig> % of the total number of genome scaffolds. this due to just  <dig> of almost  <dig>  scaffolds covers half of the current cassava genome  <cit> . no snps were identified in small scaffolds representing the remaining 13% of the cassava genome. consequently, these data constitute the most representative genotyping information for a cassava population until now, and can be relevant for future applications where dna fingerprint is pivotal.

the transition-transvertion ratio of the total of snps was  <dig> . this figure is lower when compared to previous cassava reports on genome-wide polymorphic discovery   <cit>  and expressed sequence tags    <cit> . more than 60% of the snp markers obtained were located within annotated and coding regions. the enzyme apeki used for preparation of gbs libraries is partially methylation sensitive  <cit> , and this leads to the preferential restriction of coding sequences. similar results were obtained in cattle using the enzyme psti, also a methylation sensitive enzyme  <cit> . snps located more often in cassava cds than in utrs, which has also been reported in a previous study based on genome-wide analysis  <cit> . those snps located within a cds can potentially modify the encoding amino acid chain, resulting in proteins with new functions or introduction of a stop codon. these represent an outstanding source of information to validate the function of genes  <cit>  and constitute a direct and effective way to conduct phenotype association analysis.

on the other hand, the snps positioned in non-coding regions such as introns might also play key roles in processes of alternative splicing and can be employed in evolution and diversity studies  <cit> . those snps residing in utr regions or promoters represent control points to regulate gene transcription and translation. interestingly, some non-coding regions have been reported as key in regulating and controlling the expression of genes responsible for agronomical important traits such as flowering time in maize  <cit>  and loss of seed shattering in rice  <cit> . therefore, in this version on the cassava genetic map the description and putative function for the sequences containing snps was not limited to coding regions, but to all annotated sequences containing a marker.

the cassava population used in this study is derived from a cross between highly contrasting parents for several phenotypic and phenological traits  <cit> . this cross has been employed so far to identify genomic regions involved in morphological traits  <cit>  resistance to cmd   <cit>  and cassava bacterial blight  <cit> . the highly dense genetic map reported here could contribute to future research focused on studies of allelic variation and the effect on different traits, as well qtl analysis and marker-assisted breeding programs.

the linkage map we have constructed is the second most saturated map on cassava reported so far  <cit> . however, although these two maps employed gbs derived markers and the same restriction enzyme for library construction, the total number of snps obtained was different. this could be due to library preparation, technical issues, pipeline used for the snp calling  <cit> , the quality, quantity and concentration of the dna sample, but also because of the level of genetic diversity between the parents.

the map contained  <dig>  snp markers, distributed in homogenous manner in  <dig> linkage groups, with a density of  <dig>  cm. some regions of this map are sparsely saturated, as has previously been reported for other species using snps obtained from gbs  <cit> . this fact could be explained by the scarcity or even lack of polymorphisms in these regions. however, more than 93% of the map shows a high saturation and reduced interval lower than 3 cm. it will be very useful establishing close relationships between markers and qtls  <cit> , facilitating the subsequent identification of genes involved in interesting traits.

almost half  of the current cassava genome draft sequence could be anchored to the genetic map through  <dig> scaffolds. comparative map analysis with the reported cassava maps  <cit>  revealed high correlations between linkage groups based on anchor markers. moreover, the physical map of cassava was extended with  <dig>  mb by anchoring  <dig> new scaffolds. this will contribute to the efforts of improve the current cassava genome sequence draft. it is expected that snps belonging to the same scaffolds to be in clusters on the same linkage groups. nevertheless, cluster of markers from the same scaffold are disrupted by some markers from other scaffolds. for instance in lg <dig>  scaffold  <dig>  was disrupted by scaffold  <dig> ; in lg <dig> , scaffold  <dig>  was disrupted by scaffold  <dig> . similar scenarios have also been reported  <cit> . on the other hand, it was found that  <dig> scaffolds are located at two locations belonging to different linkage groups as already reported by sraphet et al.  <cit> . the scaffolds  <dig>  and  <dig>  seem to harbor duplications, because these two scaffolds are located in more than one lg in the cassava maps  <cit> . scaffold  <dig>  is located in lg <dig> , lg <dig> and lg <dig> in the map constructed in this study as well as in that reported by rabbi et al  <cit> . scaffold  <dig>  is located in lg <dig> and lg <dig> in our study but only in lg <dig> in rabbi et al  <cit> . it is common to assume that the genomes of plants of the same species are similar, however, there is increasing evidence for rearrangements, translocations, gains or losses of dna segments and copy number variations  usually found in all chromosomes among the genomes of different genotypes of the same species  <cit> . this might be the case between the genotypes used for the draft genome sequence and the parents used in this study and might explain the differences observed between the genetic and physical map found. undoubtedly, a consensus genetic map for cassava could be helpful in this regard, as has been performed for other species with high heterozygosity level such as grapevine and apple  <cit> . other explanations might be that some of the markers identifying these scaffolds are not properly mapped or because of errors during assembly of the reads, that are still present in the draft genome sequence.

the relationship between physical and genetic distances found is the range of reported data for other plant species. the value of  <dig> kbp for 1 cm determined in this study for cassava varies between  <dig> kbp in arabidopsis to  <dig> in tomato or  <dig> in maize . this information is useful when detailed genome structure analysis or gene cloning by map-based cloning approaches will be undertaken in the future.

a high number of snp-tagged genes were classified in different go categories, showing a wide variety of functions in the annotated regions containing markers. this represents a meaningful source of genes/markers, which can be employed to answer important biological questions and set up of further experiments to confirm gene functions and links with phenotypes. go analysis is a basis for construction of functional maps for a particular group of genes of one of the functional categories, such as responses to abiotic or biotic stress. moreover, it allows the quick mapping of gene families or even gene pathways for interesting traits.

based on the presence of conserved domains in the prr and r proteins, it was possible to identify a large irp repertoire in the cassava genome. in total  <dig>  irps were identified, although probably not all of them are involved in plant immunity. the next challenge will be to identify the mamp or effectors that are recognized by these predicted proteins. the numbers of irps varies enormously between plant species. for example, the quantity of nb-arc-lrr, the largest class of r proteins, ranges from  <dig> in brassica rapa  <cit>  and  <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  to  <dig> in potato  <cit> . the reasons for the number variation of irps between different plant species have not been explained so far.

in other plant genomes, more than 40% of genes encoding for irps are clustered and the cluster size can be highly variable  <cit> . in cassava we found a range from two to eleven members per cluster whereas in arabidopsis was from two to seven  <cit> , or two to eighteen in potato  <cit> . as the physical map reported here represents  <dig> % of the current cassava genome, it is expected that more irps and clusters of them lie in the remaining genome regions that could not be analyzed. the  <dig>  irps were analyzing 532 mb sequence information. this information will be important to infer the evolutionary history of these important genes and better understand how their genome organization has influenced on their structure dynamics and adaptation to pathogen-derived selective forces.

in addition, in this study it was possible to anchor some markers with scaffolds present in the lg <dig> with a region containing loci associated with cmd reported previously. this example shown the utility of how dense genetic and physical map information in addition of phenotypic is an excellent way to accelerate the cloning of agronomic interest trait genes or to develop markers useful in marker assisted selection programs. with more phenotypic and qtl analysis the association between the markers identified in this study and traits will increase.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first functional map for immunity genes based on an integrative genetic map with anchored sequencing scaffolds from genome draft in cassava. it was possible to anchor almost half of the current cassava genome sequence draft to the genetic map. the map was enriched with  <dig> new scaffolds that increase the last version of the cassava map in  <dig>  mb. nearly 344 mb or 64% of the genome sequence draft is now anchored to the genetic map. on the other hand, the map was also enriched with annotated irps and with reported loci associated to cassava mosaic virus resistance. the presented data will allow in the future to map and associate markers with single loci or qtls for particular traits and molecular cloning of genes controlling these traits. in addition, these data will contribute to future efforts in closing the gaps in the sequence draft and for construction of a cassava consensus genetic map. the cassava irp repertoire, as well as their genetic and physical map position accompanied with the snp information will be a reference for future genetic analysis and candidate gene approaches to improve cassava resistance to their diverse biotic diseases.
