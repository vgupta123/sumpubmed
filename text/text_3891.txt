BACKGROUND
the hedgehog  signaling pathway is a critical regulator of diverse biological processes including developmental patterning and organogenesis. the pathway is initiated upon hh ligand binding to the transmembrane receptor patched . this relieves the ptc1-mediated suppression of smoothened , triggering a complex downstream signal cascade . gli <dig> and ptc <dig> are conserved hh target genes and their expression levels are considered reliable indicators of pathway activity. most biological effects of hh signaling appear to be mediated through transcriptional regulation of hh target genes, although a non-transcriptional response was recently identified  <cit> .

null mouse models have been critical in determining the role of hh signaling in the growth and morphogenesis of tissues and organs. these models have also proved valuable in gleaning the function of individual hh signal mediators in pathway regulation. in cell-based assays, gli <dig> over-expression has been found to induce hh target gene expression. the finding that gli1-/- mice develop normally,  <cit>  however, infers that gli <dig> function is dispensable for normal development. gli2-/- mice exhibit neural tube defects and demonstrate diminished hh target gene expression in several tissues  <cit> . this supports findings from cell-based assays  <cit>  that gli <dig> functions as a critical target gene activator. increased target gene expression in tissues derived from gli <dig> null mice relative to tissues from wild type mice  <cit>  suggests that gli <dig> functions to repress transcription.

numerous studies have utilized transgenic mefs to investigate diverse gene and protein properties. however, the experimental utility of primary cells is limited by a finite propagation and culture period. we showed previously that mouse embryonic fibroblasts  from gli null mice provide a tractable cell-based system in which to quantitatively examine the regulation of hh target gene expression by the gli transcription factors  <cit> . we now describe the generation of immortalized gli null mefs  and characterize their transcriptional and migratory response to hh ligand stimulation.

methods
animals
this work was conducted with the approval of the university of wisconsin animal care and use committee. gli1zfd and gli2zfd mice were generously provided by alexandra joyner and maintained on an outbred cd- <dig> background. gli3xtj mice were obtained from jackson laboratories  and were maintained on a c57/c3h background. primary mefs  <cit>  were derived from crosses of gli1zfd and gli2zfd transgenic mice and gli3xtj mutant mice. gli1zfd and gli2zfd transgenic mice were produced by homologous recombination replacing exons 2– <dig> and 3– <dig>  respectively with neo cassettes  <cit> . gli3xtj mutant mice from jackson laboratories  lack gli <dig> expression due to a deletion mutation in the 3' end of the gene  <cit> .

cell immortalization
primary mefs were grown as described previously  in 10% fetal calf serum  dmem  with 1% pen/strep and propagated following the 3t <dig> protocol for spontaneous immortalization  <cit> .  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells in  <dig>  mls media were plated in  <dig> mm plates and passed at three day intervals. after 8– <dig> passes, proliferation rates decreased and cells were allowed to grow to confluence before subsequent passing. after 15– <dig> passes, proliferation rates increased, suggesting spontaneous immortalization. following, cells were grown for an additional 10– <dig> passes to ensure stable immortalization. the absence of expression of gli <dig>  gli <dig>  and gli <dig> in corresponding null imef cell lines was confirmed by real time-rt-pcr of isolated cdna  <cit>  as well as standard genotyping of genomic dna  <cit> .

generation of stable over-expresser cell lines by retroviral gene delivery
a pires shuttle vector carrying coding sequences for hshh, hgli <dig>  Δnmgli <dig>  hsmo* and independently translated gfp  <cit>  was used to retrovirally infect wt imefs. imefs were plated at subconfluence in dmem with 10% fcs  <dig> mm plates. cells were then incubated with viral-conditioned media at 4°c for  <dig> hrs. following a  <dig> hr propagation period, gfp-sorting was used to isolate over-expressing populations.

cell treatment and real time rt-pcr
imefs were plated in multiwell primaria™  <dig> well plates  at  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per well in  <dig> μl media. cells were allowed to attach overnight and media were replaced with dmem containing 1% fcs ±  <dig> nm octylated shh peptide . at  <dig> hrs rna was harvested and gene expression was determined by real time rt-pcr as described,  <cit>  using gene specific primers as listed: gapdh: 5'-agcctcgtcccg tagacaaaat-3' and 5'-ccgtgagtg gagtcatactgga-3', ptc1: 5'-ctctggagcagatttccaagg-3' and 5'-tgccgcagttcttttgaatg-3', gli1: 5'-ggaagtcctattcacgccttga-3' and 5'-caaccttcttgctcacacatg taag-3', gli2: 5'-ccttctccaatgcct cagac-3' and 5'-ggggtctgtgtacct cttgg-3', gli3: 5'-agcccaagtattatt cagaacctttc-3' and 5'-atggatagg gattgggaatgg-3'.

migration assays
cells were grown to 70% confluence in 6-well plates and labeled with  <dig> μm celltracker green  in serum-free medium for  <dig> hr. the dye was fixed by adding 10% fcs for  <dig> h, and subsequently cells were washed and detached with  <dig> mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  in pbs. after complete detachment, cells were resuspended in serum-free medium, pipetted through a  <dig> μm cell strainer , and  <dig> μl suspension was transferred to  <dig> μm pore size hts fluoroblok cell culture inserts from bd falcon which were inserted in fitting 24-well plates. in the bottom wells,  <dig> μl medium was supplemented with indicated chemoattractant. promptly, fluorescence values representing the number of cells on the bottom side of the insert were read four times every two minutes on a series  <dig> cytofluor multi-well plate reader . the raw fluorescence data were corrected for background fluorescence. no-attractant controls were subtracted at each measured time point to correct for any effects not due to active migration to the chosen attractant. migration start points were set to zero. for comparison of the different cell lines from multiple experiments, total migration of wild type cells was set to one. for migration assays, shh peptide  was used at given concentrations. preincubation with inhibitors was performed during  <dig> minutes following detachment and inhibitors were also added to the bottom wells to exclude chemorepellent artifacts. transfection of imefs with sufu overexpression construct  was performed with effectene transfection reagent  according to manufacturer's recommendations  <dig> h before start of migration assay. western blot analysis revealed a 10-fold increase in sufu levels following transfection .

RESULTS
mef immortalization, morphological characterization, and ploidy analysis
gli3+/+ , gli1-/-, gli2-/-, gli3-/-, gli1-/-2-/-, and gli2-/-3-/- primary mefs were propagated by described 3t <dig> protocols for spontaneous immortalization  <cit> . each non-clonal immortalized cell line demonstrated a fibroblast-like morphological appearance in monolayer culture although individual lines exhibited subtle morphological differences . each imef line was determined to be tetraploid by flow cytometry analysis .

characterization of imef transcriptional hh responsiveness
imefs were treated ± shh ligand, and hh target gene expression was determined by real time rt-pcr. figure 2a shows the expression of reliable hh target gene ptc <dig> following stimulation with shh or vehicle and figure 2b shows the fold induction  of ptc <dig> expression. gli3-/- imefs demonstrated elevated basal and shh-induced expression of ptc <dig>  relative to wt cells. shh ligand stimulation induced ptc <dig> expression in each imef line except that lacking expression of both gli <dig> and gli <dig>  which are essential for a transcriptional hh response. while loss of gli <dig> alone had no effect on target gene expression, ptc <dig> induction was reduced in both gli2-/- and gli1-/-2-/- imefs relative to wt.

characterization of imef non-transcriptional hh responsiveness
while hh signaling effects are thought to be exerted primarily through transcriptional regulation, a novel pathway was recently identified which is smo-dependent but does not require transcription  <cit> . this alternative pathway triggers cytoskeletal rearrangement, driving a cellular migratory response toward hh ligand. when activation of this pathway was investigated in wild type imef cells, a dose-dependent migratory response to recombinant shh was observed . in the absence of shh ligand , a low level of baseline migration was observed and subsequently subtracted from the migratory responses in all other experiments.

the generated gli null imefs provide a valuable tool to assess transcription factor dependence of specific biological responses. when gli3+/+ , gli1-/-2-/-, and gli2-/-3-/- imef cells were allowed to migrate to  <dig> μg/ml shh peptide, migration was observed for each genotype . remarkably, increased migration to shh was observed for the null cells  that was inversely correlated with their respective transcriptional hh-responsiveness . this inverse correlation may be explained by competition for shared pathway components between the two different signal transduction mechanisms but no data to suggest such a competition have so far been presented.

to confirm that the observed migration of gli2-/-3-/- imefs to shh peptide is hh-pathway specific, we used the smo agonist purmorphamine as chemoattractant. robust migration was observed that was comparable in magnitude to migration to shh as well as the positive control, fcs . conversely, treatment with the smo inhibitor cyclopamine abrogated the migration response to shh peptide. these data indicate that the migratory response of gli2-/-3-/- imefs is smoothened dependent and thus hh-pathway dependent. an artifactual response to endotoxin contamination of shh peptide  <cit>  was excluded by demonstrating the inability of the lipopolysaccharide  inhibitor polymixin b  to reduce the cellular migratory response to shh peptide.

while the hh-inhibitory protein suppressor of fused  mitigates the gli-mediated hh transcriptional response, it appears to have no effect on migratory response  <cit> . accordingly, when sufu was overexpressed in gli2-/-3-/- imefs, shh-induced migration was not changed . the translation independence of the migratory response was confirmed by demonstrating the ineffectiveness of cycloheximide in altering the migration response to shh peptide.

to confirm the previously demonstrated requirement for intact leukotriene synthesis machinery in the migratory response to shh  <cit> , we used the lipoxygenase inhibitor mk- <dig> to block leukotriene production. when gli2-/-3-/- imefs were preincubated with  <dig> μm mk- <dig> migration to shh was markedly reduced, indicating that in cells without a functional transcriptional hh signaling pathway, leukotriene synthesis is required for shh-mediated migration .

as several studies have demonstrated that either gli <dig> and gli <dig> are required for the hh signaling transcriptional response  <cit> , the hh-induced migration of gli2-/-3-/- cells is affirmative evidence that the migratory response is independent of gli transcription factor activity. also important for this study, the observed migration data indicate that the imefs have functional hh-sensing machinery and that the diminished hh-responsiveness of gli1-/-2-/- and gli2-/-3-/- imefs is due to the absence of gli proteins, rather than ablation of the ptch1/smo receptor pair or other artifacts.

stable over-expression of hh components drives constitutive pathway activation
immortalized cells allow for retroviral-mediated, stable expression of vectors for gene-knockdown or over-expression. we generated wt imefs with stable over-expression of several pathway components and assessed pathway activity by measuring the expression of ptc <dig>  a reliable hh target gene. we found that imefs over-expressing hshh, hgli <dig>  or constitutively active forms of mgli <dig>  or hsmo  demonstrated increased pathway activity relative to imefs expressing only gfp . this demonstrates that over-expression of pathway components at multiple levels including ligand and transcription factor is sufficient to drive constitutive pathway activity.

CONCLUSIONS
the full complement of gli genes in most hh ligand-responsive cell models mitigates their utility in investigations of molecular regulation and biological activity of the individual gli transcription factors. here we demonstrated the unique transcriptional and non-transcriptional responses of a battery of gli-null imefs. moving forward, these cell lines should prove a useful tool in a wide range of the hh signaling field and have already been distributed to several investigators for a wide range of purposes including; studies of transcriptional co-regulators and gli-binding partners; chemical pathway inhibitor site of action studies; anti-gli antibody specificity studies; and several studies of gli dependence in specific hh-related biological function.
