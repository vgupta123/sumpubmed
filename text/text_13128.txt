BACKGROUND
cytoplasmic control of mrna degradation and translation is one of the important strategies of eukaryotic gene expression programs. recently discovered mirnas are important regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. in plants, mirna genes are transcribed by rna polymerase ii, and primary mirnas transcripts are subsequently capped, spliced and poly-adenylated  <cit> . plant mirna processing appears to be confined to the nucleus, and only mature mirnas are exported to cytoplasm  <cit> . in plants, dcl <dig> processes primary mirna transcripts into an mirna-mirna* duplex, with 2-nt overhangs at the 3' end  <cit> . arabidopsis hyponastic leaves , a double-stranded rna-binding domain -containing protein, and serrate, a c2h <dig> zinc finger protein, assists dcl <dig> in releasing the mirna duplex  <cit> . then hen <dig>  a methyl transferase, adds methyl groups to the 3' ends of the duplex and stabilizes the mirna duplex  <cit> . the mirna duplex is then exported into the cytoplasm by hasty, the plant ortholog of exportin  <dig>  <cit> . only the active mirna strand of the duplex, but not the passenger strand  is incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex . guided by mirna present in the risc, the complex can recognize the target transcript and prevent protein production by degradation or translational repression  <cit> .

in plants, mirnas are implicated in diverse aspects of plant growth and development, including leaf morphology and polarity, lateral root formation, hormone signaling, transition from juvenile to adult vegetative phase and vegetative to flowering phase, flowering time, floral organ identity and reproduction  <cit> . a role of mirnas in plant stress responses was also evident from recent studies. several mirnas are regulated in response to diverse stress conditions, which suggests that mirna-directed post-transcriptional regulation of their respective target genes is important to cope with the stress  <cit> .

because mirnas have emerged as vital components of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression important for plant growth and development, as well as plant stress responses, identifying conserved mirna homologs in as many plant species as possible is important. computational approaches are successful in identifying conserved mirnas in many plants and animals, but they require knowledge of the complete genome sequence, which is unavailable for most plant species. however, large genomic fragmented data in the form of genome survey sequences , high-throughput genomics sequences  and nonredundant nucleotides , as well as expressed sequence tags , are available for several plant species and can be used for identification of conserved mirnas. gss and htgs of genebank represent only short stretches of genomic sequence but can still provide a broader sampling of unfinished genomes. the nr database contains finished genomic sequences and cdnas. previously zhang et al.  <cit>  identified conserved mirnas in plants using ests alone.

here, we used the available gss, htgs, and nr repositories and ests to identify a large number of conserved mirna families in diverse plant species. using blast searches for mirna homologs coupled with secondary structure predictions with precursor sequences, we identified  <dig> mirnas in  <dig> diverse plant species. nineteen mirna families were found in  <dig> legumes, medicago truncatula, lotus japonicus and glycine max. additionally,  <dig> mirnas, previously thought to be arabidopsis specific, are expressed in brassica spp., which indicates that these mirnas evolved recently in the arabidopsis-brassica clade and gives valuable information to trace their evolution.

RESULTS
identification of conserved plant mirnas in  <dig> plant species
the basis for computational identification of mirnas is the conserved, mature mirna sequence coupled with the predictable secondary structure of mirna surrounding sequences  <cit> . we used ncbi blastn to find mirna sequences  matching at least  <dig> nt and leaving  <dig> nt for possible sequence variations in different plant species. to identify mirna homologs in diverse plant species, the whole set of arabidopsis and rice mature mirna sequences from the mirbase were used in blast searches against publicly available gss, htgs, est and nr databases. the mirna precursor sequences containing the mirna sequences were extracted from the respective databases and used for fold-back structure predictions with use of mfold  <cit> . mirnas are derived from either the 5' or 3' arm of the hairpin structure, which is also conserved across diverse plant species. to confirm this feature, the hairpin structures were compared with the previously reported mirna hairpin structures. this search resulted in identification of mirnas in  <dig> diverse plant species. specifically, we found > <dig> mirna families in  <dig> plant species,  <dig> to <dig> families in  <dig> plant species and  <dig> to  <dig> families in  <dig> plant species. our survey also identified relatively more conserved mirna families in some of the plant species. for instance, we found  <dig> mirna families in maize,  <dig> in sorghum,  <dig> in wheat, and  <dig> in citrus sps. other notable mirna families were found in some important plant species:  <dig> in grapes,  <dig> in tomato,  <dig> in sugarcane and  <dig> in potato. we also found five families  conserved in gymnosperms and two  in selaginella.

interestingly, mir <dig>  mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir165/ <dig> and mir <dig> homologs were found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> diverse plant species, respectively . six families  were found in 30– <dig> diverse plant species . similarly, seven families  were found in 20– <dig> diverse plant species. the families, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were found in 10– <dig> diverse plant species.

in dicots, leguminous plants form an important source of human and animal dietary needs second only to cereal plants. molecular tools, including genomics, are being used to rapidly develop medicago truncatula, lotus japonicus and glycine max as model legumes to pursue a number of important biological questions unique to these plants. however, only a few mirnas from these important legumes have been recorded in the mirna registry. with the exception of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  our survey has identified the remaining  <dig> conserved mirna families in legumes . among the ~ <dig> mirna families conserved between dicots and monocots, mir <dig> homologs were found in the largest number  of plant species, whereas mir <dig> homologs were found in the least number  of plant species. by searching all gene bank sources, we obtained a wider coverage, both in terms of mirna families and number of diverse plant species.

on the basis of mature mirna sequence similarity, these mirnas were grouped into families, with members often varying by  <dig> to  <dig> nt. here, we found  <dig> new mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families in diverse plant species. this includes one new member for each of the families, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  we also identified two new members belonging to mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families and three new members belonging to mir <dig> .

zhang et al.  <cit>  classified the mirnas as highly, moderately or lowly conserved, based on the number of plants in which each family of mirna is predicted, although the number of ests available for different plant species varies highly. accordingly, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families were classified as lowly conserved  <cit> . zhang et al. retrieved mir <dig> and mir <dig> homologs from nine and eight plant species, respectively, which formed the basis for the authors' categorization of the families as being lowly conserved  <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> are specifically up-regulated in response to low nutrient conditions. mir <dig> is induced under low phosphate conditions  <cit> , whereas mir <dig> is induced in response to low-sulfate conditions  <cit> . thus the representation of primary mir <dig> and mir <dig> transcripts in the ests generated from untreated plants is highly unlikely. by contrast, using gss, htgs, est and nr databases, we found mir <dig> and mir <dig> homologs in as many as  <dig> and  <dig> diverse plant species, respectively. in fact, with use of gss alone, mir <dig> and mir <dig> homologs were retrieved from  <dig> and  <dig> diverse plant species, respectively . these results suggest that these two mirna families are not lowly conserved mirnas, as previously considered.

mir <dig> was cloned from arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . by searching the est database alone, mir <dig> homologs were found in nine plant species. as a result, zhang et al.  <cit>  classified mir <dig> as one of the lowly conserved mirnas. in this study, we found mir <dig> homologs in  <dig> diverse plant species, including selaginella . thus, mir <dig> is one of the deeply conserved mirnas. mir <dig> has been shown to guide cleavage of plantacyanin, its target transcript in rice  <cit> . also in a recent report, mir <dig> was found to be expressed in selaginella and to target a conserved plantacyanin transcript  <cit> . the deep conservation of mir <dig> across the plant kingdom indicates that the regulation of plantacyanin transcript levels has been preserved for a long time. similarly, we found mir <dig> homologs in  <dig> plant species ; therefore mir <dig> is not a lowly conserved mirna as classified by zhang et al.  <cit> . together, these findings indicate that the classification of mirnas as highly, moderately and lowly conserved mirnas on the basis of available ests alone may not reflect the true depth of conservation.

dicot- and monocot-specific mirnas
mir <dig> was initially identified in arabidopsis and later found in populus trichocorpa  <cit> . in a previous report, mir <dig> was considered a dicot-specific mirna because its homologs were not found in rice. in the present study, we found mir <dig> homologs in  <dig> dicotyledonous plants, including populus, papaya, tomato, potato, sunflower, and brassica spp , but not in monocotyledonous plants. the identification of mir <dig> homologs in other dicots revealed two new members of this mirna family. as compared to the arabidopsis mature mir <dig> sequence, mir <dig> differed at the 5' most nucleotide in papaya and potato and the 5' most  <dig> nt in tomato . thus, the mir <dig> family is represented by at least three members in dicots. the identification of mir <dig> in as many as  <dig> dicots provided large-scale authenticity for considering it a dicot-specific mirna.

sequencing of rice small rna libraries resulted in the identification of a few monocot-specific mirnas  <cit> . rice mir <dig> homologs found in maize, sorghum and sugarcane but not in arabidopsis or populus led to the suggestion that mir <dig> may be a monocot-specific mirna  <cit> . in this study, we found additional evidence to support classifying mir <dig> as a monocot-specific mirna, because mir <dig> homolog was recovered from pennisetum ciliare, another monocot . similarly, mir <dig> has been reported as a monocot-specific mirna  <cit> ; its homologs were found in wheat, barley, sorghum, switchgrass, sugarcane, brachypodium distachyon, oryza officinalis and oryza minuta . recently, five additional members of the mir <dig> family, all of which are conserved only in monocots were reported .

mir <dig> homologs were found to be deeply conserved  <cit> . mir <dig> in rice is represented by two variants with five loci   <cit> . the mature mirna sequence corresponding to osmir396a,b,c is conserved across dicots and monocots. the other variant, represented by osmir396d,e, differs from osmir396a,b,c by an additional nucleotide "g" between positions  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . because the exact sequence of mir396d,e has not been found in the arabidopsis or populus genomes and its expression could not be detected in arabidopsis, it was considered a monocot-specific version of the mir <dig> family  <cit> . consistent with this suggestion, mir396d,e homologs were identified in five other monocots – sorghum bicolor, maize, wheat, barley and festuca arundancea – and a hairpin structure could be predicted for all of these mirna precursors . thus, the identification of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and the mir396d/e variant of the mir <dig> family in several monocots provided solid support for consideration of these mirnas as being monocot specific.

arabidopsis-brassica lineage-specific mirnas
an initial experimental approach led to the identification of at least four non-conserved mirnas in arabidopsis. mir <dig> is one among them, and is represented by two loci  in arabidopsis  <cit>  and mir <dig> homologs are not computationally/experimentally evident either in rice  <cit>  or in poplar  <cit> . therefore, mir <dig> has been considered an arabidopsis-specific mirna. here, we found computational evidence for the presence of mir <dig> homologs in two brassica sps. . further, the mature mir <dig> sequence and the sequence that adopts the fold-back structure is highly conserved in brassica oleracea and brassica rapa . mir <dig> in b. rapa differed from mir <dig> in arabidopsis by  <dig> nt at the 5' end. northern blot analysis with labeled mir <dig> antisense oligonucleotide revealed that mir <dig> is abundantly expressed in b. oleracea and b. rapa seedlings .

mir <dig> is one of the recently identified mirnas that has some sequence similarity with the mir390; therefore, xie et al.  <cit>  considered it a member of the mir <dig> family. although mir <dig> is one of the broadly conserved mirnas, the mir <dig> sequence has not been identified in plants other than arabidopsis, which led to the hypothesis that mir <dig> is a non-conserved arabidopsis-specific mirna  <cit> . our search revealed an mir <dig> homolog, and a fold-back structure could be predicted for the precursor sequence in b. oleracea .

recent deep sequencing of arabidopsis small rnas suggested that the arabidopsis genome encodes more non-conserved mirna families than conserved mirna families  <cit> . these newly found arabidopsis mirnas are considered non-conserved because the orthologous sequences have not been found in the rice or populus genomes  <cit> . the non-conserved plant mirnas presumably emerged and dissipated in short evolutionary time scales  <cit> . high-throughput sequencing of small rnas from species closely related to arabidopsis would help define the lifespan of these transient mirna genes  <cit> . bioinformatic inspection of the conservation of these mirnas in brassica may not be completely informative at this time because of the lack of complete genome information and the search for these mirna precursor sequences among ests has been unsuccessful. because these newly found mirnas have been recovered only in high-throughput sequencing suggests that their abundance is extremely low, and thus their representation in ests is unlikely. to examine whether any of these newly found mirna homologs are expressed in brassica, a close relative of arabidopsis, we performed small rna blot analysis using rna isolated from two brassica spp. . to enhance the detection ability, we used low-molecular weight rna isolated from 4-week old seedlings of b. oleracea and b. rapa. the expression of  <dig> of the newly found mirnas  was analyzed. we chose these mirnas because they could be detected on small-rna blot analysis in arabidopsis and were relatively more abundant in the libraries than other newly found mirnas in arabidopsis  <cit> . three of the mirnas  could be detected in one or both of the brassica spp, although their expression levels varied greatly . for instance, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were more abundant in b. oleracea than in b. rapa . surprisingly, we were unable to detect a signal for mir <dig> and mir <dig> in b. rapa . computational analysis revealed mir <dig> and mir <dig> homologs in brassica , although we were not successful in detecting a signal using a probe against mir <dig> in brassica seedlings. mir <dig> appears to be specifically or abundantly expressed in siliques of arabidopsis  <cit> . recently, conserved mir <dig> homologs were found in  <dig> brassica spp.  <cit> .

computational analysis revealed the conservation of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> in brassica spp, and our small rna blot analysis confirmed the expression of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> in at least one of the brassica spp . thus,  <dig> of the mirnas , whose expression is not known outside arabidopsis, are indeed conserved between arabidopsis and brassica.

arabidopsis and rice are known to express a large number of non-conserved diverse small-interfering rnas   <cit> . the only exception to-date is that trans-acting sirnas , a sub-class of sirnas that are deeply conserved  <cit> . recently, lu et al.  <cit>  found a few non-mirna small rnas in arabidopsis. we used small-rna blot analysis to test whether any of the three small rnas  are conserved between arabidopsis and brassica. surprisingly, small- <dig> and small- <dig> could be detected in both brassica species we tested , which suggests that these two small rnas are conserved between arabidopsis and brassica and represent lineage-specific small rnas.

clusters of plant mirnas
clusters of mirnas frequently found in animals are transcribed together as a polycistron  <cit> . although mirna clusters are not common in plants, a few mirna families  have been found to exist as clusters  <cit> . recently, two tandem mir <dig> homologs were reported in rice and maize  <cit> . here, we identified an mir <dig> cluster in several other plant species: two tandem mir <dig> homologs located within  <dig> nt of the same orientation in the rice est ak <dig>  two mir <dig> homologs separated by ~ <dig> nt in the sugarcane est ca <dig>  two mir <dig> homologs separated by  <dig> nt in the est cl <dig> of sorghum bicolor, and two mir <dig> homologs separated by  <dig> nt in the maize est cl <dig>  additionally two very closely spaced mir <dig> homologs were found in a genomic clone of oryza granulata , oryza punctata . in comparing the syntenic regions among  <dig> cereals , wang et al.  <cit>  suggested that two mir <dig> homologs in tandem arrangement are highly conserved among cereals. interestingly, we found a similar arrangement of two tandem mir <dig> homologs separated by  <dig> nt in the est cj <dig> of ipomea nil, a dicotyledonous plant. these findings suggest that the tandem arrangement of two mir <dig> homologs is not restricted to cereals and seems to exist in diverse plant species that are distantly related.

we also found two tandem mir <dig> homologs in the same orientation and separated by  <dig> nt in the cotton genomic clone dx <dig>  two mirnas belonging to the mir <dig> family in cotton  and brassica napus  have been recently reported. because these homologs are close together argues against their origin from two different mir <dig> primary transcripts, although evidence for the expression of these two mir <dig> homologs in one transcript in the form of an est is lacking. additionally, mir <dig> homologs were found in clusters in lactuca sativa , populus tremula  and euphorbia esula  but not in arabidopsis or rice. thus, we show mirna gene clustering for mir <dig> and mir <dig> loci in diverse plant species. the results suggest that at least four mirna families  exist as mirna clusters in plants.

discussion
recent studies have established that mirnas play critical roles in post-transcriptional gene expression in higher eukaryotes. evidence for conservation of plant mirnas has come from genomic and est sequence data from diverse plants showing sequences containing mirna hairpins as well as sequences homologous to the known or predicted arabidopsis targets retaining mirna complementary sites  <cit> . to date, ~ <dig> mirna families known to be conserved between dicots and monocots forms the basis for the identification of these mirna families in diverse plant species by use of publicly available nucleotide databases. by searching these databases, we identified a total of  <dig> mirnas in  <dig> different plant species. our analysis yielded > <dig> conserved mirna families in  <dig> plant species and  <dig> to <dig> conserved families in  <dig> plant species. we also identified relatively more conserved mirna families . at least five families  were found in more than  <dig> plant species . we found six families  in 30– <dig> species; seven  in 20– <dig> species; and five  in 10– <dig> species . computational analysis coupled with expression analysis provided evidence for six of the newly found mirnas as being conserved between arabidopsis and brassica. additionally, some of the non-mirna small rnas  found in arabidopsis were also found in brassica . these findings provide the first large-scale identification of lineage-specific mirnas and other small rnas.

mir <dig> and mir <dig> are specifically induced under low-sulfate and low-phosphate conditions, respectively  <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> homologs are in as many as  <dig> and  <dig> diverse plant species, respectively . mir <dig> plays an important role in phosphate homeostasis  <cit> . similarly, mir <dig> homologs were found in  <dig> plant species. the down-regulation of mir <dig> has been implicated in up-regulating cu/zn-superoxide dismutase  <dig>  and  <dig> in arabidopsis in response to oxidative stress conditions  <cit> . in contrast, mir <dig> is up-regulated in response to cu2+ limiting conditions  <cit> . mir <dig> induction is inversely correlated with the expression of csd <dig> and csd <dig> genes, thus maintaining cu2+ homeostasis and mobilizing the available cu2+ to more indispensable proteins such as plastocyanin  <cit> . mir <dig> and its target gene tir <dig> are conserved  <cit> . a role for mir <dig> in arabidopsis disease resistance has been shown recently  <cit> . thus, we found several stress-responsive mirna homologs – mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> – highly conserved in diverse monocots and dicots, which suggests that these mirna-guided target gene regulations have been well preserved, possibly because they are important for plant stress tolerance  <cit> .

recent deep sequencing of plant small rna libraries clearly demonstrated that plants express more non-conserved than conserved mirnas  <cit> . the non-conserved mirnas presumably emerged and dissipated in short evolutionary time scales  <cit> . such rapid emergence of new genes is likely facilitated by the small size and simple architecture of mirna genes derived from their targets  <cit> , although whether such mechanisms are relevant for most newly emergent mirnas  <cit>  is unclear. small-rna blot analysis for  <dig> of the newly found mirnas confirmed that  <dig> are expressed in brassica seedlings. most of the newly found non-conserved mirnas in arabidopsis are abundantly expressed in inflorescence  <cit> , but we did not test this expression. thus, the remaining seven mirnas not detected in brassica seedlings need further study. the absence of expression of some of the new mirnas in brassica could be due to their loss in brassica, or they recently evolved in arabidopsis after the divergence.

the existence of mirnas and tas3-derived tasirnas in plants is well known  <cit> . interestingly, in the present study, we found two small rnas  conserved between arabidopsis and brassica. small- <dig>  has been recently identified  <cit>  and is derived from a long perfect fold-back structure that is reminiscent of sirnas derived from dsrna. small- <dig> accumulation was dependent on all four of the dicers in arabidopsis  <cit> . it disappeared only in a quadruple dcl  mutant but accumulated alone in dcl <dig> or in a triple mutant  <cit> . small- <dig> is derived from the srk gene that is capable of adopting a fold-back structure, and its expression is not dependent on rdr <dig>  <cit> .

loss of self-incompatibility in arabidopsis thaliana and brassica is thought to be due to inactivation of a self-incompatibility  system that involves srk and scr genes. in the brassica si system, genes encoding for si specificity in pistil  and pollen  are thought to be preserved because of rare or no recombination, and disruption of this structure would lead to loss of si. loss of the si system in a. thaliana columbia- <dig>  was attributed to non-functional srk and scr genes  <cit> . lu et al.  <cit>  hypothesized a role for small- <dig> in loss of srk function in a. thaliana with its accumulation. here, we showed that the arabidopsis small- <dig> probe can detect a strong signal at the expected size range in two brassica species, which indicates that small- <dig> rna also accumulates in brassica seedlings. further studies are required to clarify the role of this small rna in self-incompatibility. the expression of several srk genes from self-compatible plant species in vegetative tissues suggests that srks may play a developmental role. similarly, the detection of small- <dig> in brassica seedlings also suggests its role in development in brassica.

until now, only mir <dig> homologs were found to exist as clusters in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . some of these clusters are co-transcribed because they were found in ests of rice  <cit> . similarly, the clustered organization of mir <dig> in physcometrella was recently reported  <cit> . although mir <dig> homologs in arabidopsis and rice were found to be closely spaced  <cit> , their expression in one transcript is unknown. our analysis indicated that along with the well-documented clustered organization of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> also exist as clusters in several plant species. these observations suggest that the tandem duplications are the cause for such an organization. retention of tandem duplications may be due dosage response in some plants. gene duplication is estimated to occur at a higher rate in eukaryotic genomes in general  <cit>  and in flowering plants in particular  <cit> .

although several similar attempts were made earlier , largely these studies used either single plant species  or single nucleotide repository . in this study, we used all nucleotide repositories and considered all plant species. furthermore, earlier reports  included small rnas that were initially identified as mirnas but turned out to be sirnas . here, we used a conservative approach and considered only mirnas that are confidently annotated for the identification of homologs in diverse plant species.

the identification of conserved mirnas by searching all available nucleotide databases allows for wider and better coverage of diverse plant species than that with use of the est database alone. our discovery of some of the recently found arabidopsis mirnas conserved in brassica, a close relative of arabidopsis, will help in tracing the evolution of these mirnas by analyzing their expression in common ancestors of brassica and arabidopsis. arabidopsis and b. oleracea are closely related species that diverged from a common ancestor approximately 15– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . because some mirnas have been found in both arabidopsis and brassica, these mirnas may be present in their ancestors. expression analysis of the origin of brassicacea , at the base of the order brassicales, or cleomaceae, a sister to brassicaceae, will provide close, intermediate and distant comparisons to trace the evolution of these mirnas.

CONCLUSIONS
using all publicly available nucleotide databases,  <dig> mirnas were identified in  <dig> diverse plant species. by combining the expression analysis with the computational approach we found that  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> small rnas that have been identified only in arabidopsis thus far, are also conserved in brassica spp. these findings will be useful for tracing the evolution of small rnas by examining their expression in common ancestors of the arabidopsis-brassica lineage.
