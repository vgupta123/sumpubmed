BACKGROUND
v. dahliae, the causal agent of verticillium wilt, is one of the most destructive plant pathogens, affecting over  <dig> plant species, including important ornamental, horticultural, agronomical and woody plants  <cit> . its control is difficult because it produces microsclerotia, which can survive in soil for several years  <cit> . moreover, no effective fungicides or other chemicals are available to overcome this pathogen once the plant is infected. despite a great deal of research, the molecular mechanisms behind the pathogenicity of this fungus have remained unclear  <cit> .

an efficient transformation system is necessary for genetic manipulation and functional genomics studies of fungi  <cit> . a number of methods, agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation , peg-mediated transformation, electroporation, and particle bombardment, have been used to transform different fungal species, including v. dahliae, with variable efficiencies . atmt is widely used for transforming various materials such as protoplasts, spores or hyphae of several fungal species  <cit> . in v. dahliae, atmt has been used for targeted gene disruption  or deletion , but it is laborious and time-consuming. peg-mediated transformation of v. dahliae was first reported in  <dig> and has yielded a high efficiency of transformation ; however, obtaining the large amounts of high-quality protoplasts crucial to the success of the method is difficult for many fungal species including v. dahliae. moreover peg-mediated transformation results in a high percentage of transient transformation. yet for filamentous fungi, this method has been ideal because it is simple and fast  <cit> .

rna interference  is an effective tool to investigate gene function in various organisms . in filamentous fungi, plasmid constructs expressing dsrna have been applied for this purpose with a silencing efficiency between 70– <dig> % . although using this procedure for silencing gene is efficient, designing an rnai plasmid is laborious. synthetic sirna can be used for the same purpose, e.g., incubation of synthetic sirna with germinating spores of a. nidulans successfully silenced the target gene, leading to reduced mycelial growth  <cit> . in another study, synthetic dsrna had in vitro antifungal activity against adenylate cyclase, dna polymerase alpha subunit and dna polymerase delta subunit in f. oxysporum and hindered spore germination  <cit> . however, transforming spores of certain fungal species like v. dahliae with sirna is difficult as we have tried different ways to transform but obtained no satisfactory results . thus, methods to directly transform protoplasts with synthetic sirna to elucidate gene function have been sought. as reported for fusarium sp. hkf <dig>  sirnas designed against hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme a reductase  and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase  were used to transform protoplasts and knockdown these genes, however the silencing was effective for only  <dig> h  <cit> .

our main objective was to develop an easy and quick method to transform v. dahliae and facilitate screening of essential genes. first, we developed a protocol using one enzyme to obtain high quality protoplasts from v. dahliae with excellent regeneration efficiency in tb <dig> broth. we then compared variations in peg-mediated transformation and electroporation methods to develop the most efficient protocol to transform the protoplasts with the gfp plasmid . we also used synthetic sirnas  targeting the gfp gene in the gfp-transformed strain  and the vta <dig> gene, a regulatory gene that is essential for growth and conidiation of v. dahliae  <cit> , in the wild-type strain  using peg-mediated transformation to test whether the sirnas can enter the protoplasts and inhibit the expression of these genes. our results indicated that peg-mediated transformation is more effective than electroporation. moreover the transformation efficiency for sirnas and the linear gfp cassette was significantly higher than with the circular gfp plasmid.

our method of protoplast isolation, regeneration and transformation has advantages over other available methods in its rapidity and ease for generating protoplasts using a single enzyme and transforming the protoplasts with high efficiency. these techniques are conducive for the study of gene function using sirna silencing or gene deletion in a short period of time.

methods
fungal growth and spore harvesting
strain v <dig> of v. dahliae, a highly toxic and defoliating wild-type pathogenic strain, provided by prof. guiliang jian of the institute of plant protection, chinese academy of agricultural sciences , was cultured on pda plates at  <dig> °c for 7- <dig> days. sterile distilled water was added to the plates to harvest spores by gently scraping the agar with a sterile loop. the resulting suspension was filtered through a sterile  <dig> μm nylon filter  and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the final spore concentration was adjusted to  <dig>  × 107/ml.

protoplast isolation
driselase , selected after comparing with a variety of enzymes , was prepared by dissolving  <dig> mg driselase in  <dig> ml nacl  and centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min. the supernatant was taken and purified using  <dig>  μm filters . two milliliters of v. dahliae spores  were cultured in  <dig> ml complete medium  for 16– <dig> h at  <dig> °c and  <dig> rpm. mycelia were then separated from the culture and medium using a sterile  <dig> μm nylon filter, then washed 2– <dig> times with  <dig>  m nacl. the harvested mycelia were aseptically transferred to  <dig> ml of the driselase solution and incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> – <dig>  h at  <dig> rpm. the preparation was then checked every  <dig> min for protoplast release. after the incubation time, the mixture was then filtered using a sterile  <dig> μm nylon filter to remove any hyphal fragments, and the protoplasts were centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed 2– <dig> times either with  <dig> m sorbitol, in case the protoplast has to be used for electroporation, or with stc buffer , if used for peg-mediated transformation. the concentration of protoplasts was adjusted with either  <dig> m sorbitol or stc to 106/ml.

regeneration of protoplasts
the ability of the protoplasts to regenerate was examined in cm, tb <dig> and czapek-dox broths. briefly,  <dig> μl protoplasts  were cultured in  <dig> ml broth and incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h. protoplasts were observed for regeneration with a light microscope at 20× magnification, and the percentage of regeneration was calculated by counting the number of regenerated protoplasts out of total protoplasts cultured. in order to isolate a single colony, the regenerated protoplast suspension was centrifuged at  <dig> rpm, the supernatant discarded and pellet was resuspended in  <dig> μl cm broth, serially diluted and cultured on pda for 5– <dig> days until the colonies appeared.

gfp plasmid and sirnas
the gfp plasmid  was kindly provided by professor xie bingyan of the institute of vegetables and flowers, caas. primers gfp- <dig> 5′ ctttcgacactgaaatacgtcg3′ and gfp- <dig> 5′ gcatcagagcagattgtactgagag3′ were used to amplify the gfp cassette from the gfp plasmid.

the sirnas targeting different regions of the gfp gene  and the vta <dig> gene  were designed and synthesized by oligobio, beijing, china. the sequences of sirnas are given in table  <dig> and the positions of these sirnas along the genes are shown in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> table  <dig> sirna sequences developed against gfp and vta2




peg-mediated transformation
for peg-mediated transformation, an established protocol was followed with some modifications  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> μl protoplasts  was mixed with  <dig> μg gfp plasmid  as a selection marker) or linear gfp cassette  in a  <dig> ml falcon tube and incubated on ice for  <dig> min;  <dig>  ml  <dig> % peg solution in stc buffer was added to the tube dropwise, gently swirled and left at room temperature for  <dig> min followed by the addition of  <dig> ml tb <dig> broth. the tubes were incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h, and gfp expression was checked with a fluorescence microscope . transformants, transformed with gfp plasmid, were selected on pda media supplemented with hygromycin b  after regeneration in tb <dig> broth. further confirmation of the positive transformants was made by pcr using gfp-cf 5′agctggacggcgacgtaaac3′ and gfp-cr 5′gatgggggtgttctgctggt3′ primers.

electroporation
before using electroporation for transformation, protoplasts were shocked at different field strengths from 100- <dig> v/cm to ensure that electroporation had no or a very low lethal effect on the regeneration of protoplasts.

the protoplasts were mixed with  <dig> μg of the gfp plasmid or linear gfp cassette as described above, using  <dig> m sorbitol as the buffer, and kept on ice for  <dig> min. the mixtures were transferred to a  <dig> -cm gap cuvette , and different voltages  were applied for  <dig> ms using a genpulser xcell electroporation system . immediately after electroporation, the protoplasts were transferred to  <dig> ml tb <dig> broth and incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h. after regeneration of protoplasts, the culture was centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> μl tb <dig> and observed with a fluorescence microscope.

sirna inhibition assay for gfp and vta <dig> genes
for targeting the gfp gene,  <dig> μl vd-gfp protoplasts  were transformed with  <dig> μm sirna-gfp <dig>  sirna-gfp <dig>  sirna-gfp <dig> or sirna-gfp <dig> by peg-mediated transformation and regenerated for  <dig> h as described. inhibition of gfp expression was checked using fluorescence microscopy by counting the number of hyphae with fluorescence. the percentage of gfp inhibition was determined by dividing the number of hyphae with no fluorescence on the number of hyphae with fluorescence multiplied by  <dig> 

similarly, for silencing vta <dig> gene, protoplasts obtained from vd-wt were treated with sirna-vta <dig>  sirna-vta <dig>  sirna-vta <dig> and sirna-vta <dig> independently in a final concentration of  <dig> μm or with  <dig>  μm sirnas mix using peg-mediated transformation in rnase free environment. sirna-vtanc was used as a negative control. briefly, protoplasts obtained from vd-wt  were mixed with either of the sirnas or with mixed sirnas in  <dig> ml falcon tube and incubated on ice for  <dig> min;  <dig>  ml  <dig> % peg solution in stc buffer was added to the tube dropwise, gently swirled and left at room temperature for  <dig> min followed by the addition of  <dig> ml tb <dig> broth. after  <dig> h of incubation in tb <dig> broth, the cultures were centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> μl tb <dig> broth and pipeted onto the center of cm agar plates. the colony diameter was measured after  <dig> days at  <dig> °c.

qrt-pcr analysis of vta <dig> expression level
in order to further confirm that the reduction in growth of v. dahliae was due to silencing of vta <dig> gene, we conducted qrt-pcr. after treating the protoplasts with sirnas , they were cultured in tb <dig> broth for  <dig> h and the mycelia were harvested for rna extraction by rna extraction kit . qrt-pcr was carried out in  <dig> real time pcr system . gene specific primers were used: vta2-f 5′ggcttcctcaaggtcggctatg3′, vta2-r 5′gctgcatgtcatcccacttcttc3′, vdactin-f 5′ggcttcctcaaggtcggctatg3′ and vdactin-r 5′gctgcatgtcatcccacttcttc3′ vdactin was used as a housekeeping gene  <cit> . the relative expression of the targeted gene was analyzed using the 2-∆∆ct method. the standard curve met experimental requirements   <cit> .

statistical analysis
all experiments were done in three independent replicates. means ± standard deviation and significant differences were determined using duncan’s multiple range test and t-test with p-values <  <dig>  in spss  <dig>  software .

RESULTS
isolation and regeneration efficiency of protoplasts
in order to select an efficient enzyme for protoplasts isolation from v. dahliae, we treated the mycelia with different enzymes  and found that driselase resulted in maximum protoplasts yield . while investigating the effect of driselase concentration on the yield of protoplast,  <dig> mg/ml was found the best .

for selecting the optimal mycelial age and enzymolytic time to isolate protoplasts, spores were cultured for different times  and then treated with driselase . the optimal mycelial age was found to be  <dig> h which yielded  <dig>  × 107/ml ±  <dig>  protoplasts when treated with driselase , while  <dig>  h enzymolysis time was observed to produce the maximum number of protoplasts for all culture ages . when the three media were tested for regeneration efficiency, the efficiency was highest in tb <dig>  .fig.  <dig> optimization of protoplast isolation and regeneration. a protoplast isolation efficiency from mycelia cultured for  <dig> to  <dig> h and then treated for  <dig>  h in  <dig> ml driselase mixture. b protoplast isolation efficiency after various digestion times with driselase. mycelia were harvested at  <dig> h post inoculation. c regeneration efficiency in different media. protoplasts  were cultured in  <dig> ml tb <dig>  cm or czapek-dox broth. after  <dig> h, the regeneration efficiency was measured as the number of protoplast regenerated out of total number of protoplast cultured multiplied by 100



observation of fluorescence from gfp expression
soon after peg-mediated transformation and electroporation, the protoplasts were cultured for  <dig> h in tb <dig> broth to detect gfp expression as an indicator of transformation. strong gfp fluorescence was observed in the transformed protoplasts, but none was seen in the vd-wt . peg- <dig> gave the highest transformation of all the methods for both linear gfp  and for gfp plasmid  . electroporation for both gfp plasmid  and linear gfp cassette  was significantly lower than the peg-mediated  transformation.fig.  <dig> fluorescence detection of gfp expression in hyphae regenerated from transformed protoplast of v. dahliae. a gfp expression after  <dig> h of incubation. protoplasts  were transformed with  <dig> μg of either gfp plasmid or linear gfp cassette and cultured. fluorescence was observed in hyphae regenerated from transformed protoplast of v. dahliae after  <dig> h incubation in tb <dig>  b transformation efficiency of protoplasts using electroporation  or peg-mediated transformation . after transformation, the protoplasts were cultured in tb <dig> broth for  <dig> h. number of transformants was calculated per microgram dna by counting the number of hyphae with gfp fluorescence. c silencing of gfp expression with sirna. vd-gfp protoplasts were transformed with  <dig> μm of  <dig> different sirnas  separately by peg-mediated transformation. the regenerated mycelia from the transformed protoplasts were observed for gfp fluorescence. d assay for sirna inhibition of gfp. inhibition of gfp expression by sirna-gfp <dig>  sirna-gfp <dig>  sirna-gfp <dig> and sirna-gfp <dig> was compared after in the regenerated hyphae from the transformed protoplasts



gfp transformants selection and stability of the transgene
gfp transformants derived from gfp plasmid transformation were selected after 5– <dig> days of culturing the regenerated protoplasts on pda plates supplemented with hygromycin b. the selected gfp transformants fluoresced strongly when viewed with fluorescence microscopy. further confirmation of the transformants was made by pcr . expression of gfp was observed from three generations of transformants, indicating stable gfp expression throughout these three generations.

silencing of gfp gene in strain vd-gfp with sirnas
protoplasts of strain vd-gfp were treated with the different sirnas targeting the gfp gene, and checked for inhibition of gfp expression after regeneration . we found out that sirna-gfp <dig> gave the best silencing efficiency  compared with  <dig> % or less with sirna-gfp <dig>  sirna-gfp <dig> and sirna-gfp <dig> . the silencing of the gfp gene lasted for at least  <dig> h.

silencing of vta <dig> gene
to validate whether v. dahliae genes can be silenced by sirna using vta <dig> as a reference gene, the gene was successfully silenced with sirnas. on cm plates, the colony diameter of sirna-vta <dig> group  was significantly smaller than that of the sirna-vtanc group  . the colony diameters of sirna-vta <dig>  sirna-vta <dig>  sirna-vta <dig> and sirna-vtamix groups were  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively. as determined by colony diameter, sirna-vta <dig> had the best silencing efficiency. to further confirm whether the reduction in colony diameter was due to silencing of vta <dig> gene, qrt-pcr was conducted to determine the relative expression level of this gene in all the groups. the data was in accordance with that obtained from colony assessment. expression level of vta <dig> in sirna-vta <dig> group was significantly lower than the other groups .fig.  <dig> assay for sirna inhibition of vta <dig> gene. protoplasts  isolated from vd-wt were transformed with  <dig> μm sirna-vta <dig>  sirna-vta <dig>  sirna-vta <dig> and sirna-vta <dig> independently in separate tubes and also with  <dig>  μm each of these sirnas via peg-mediated transformation. protoplasts were regenerated for  <dig> h in tb <dig> broth at  <dig> °c, pelleted at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min, then resuspended in  <dig> μl tb <dig> broth and cultured in the center of cm agar plate. colony diameter was measured for each group after  <dig> days at  <dig> °c . a colony morphology of different groups on cm agar. b colony diameters of control and sirna groups. c relative expression level of vta <dig> gene in different sirna treated groups. rna was isolated from mycelia harvested after  <dig> h, first strand cdna was synthesized and qrt-pcr was conducted for different sirna groups



discussion
in this study, we isolated and regenerated protoplasts from v. dahliae, then transformed the protoplasts with the gfp plasmid and linear gfp cassette using peg-mediated transformation and electroporation, and silenced the gfp and vta <dig> genes using sirnas.

protoplasts have been isolated from many fungal species at various efficiencies depending on the species and conditions. driselase has proved efficient for protoplast isolation from fusarium graminearum  and ascosphaera apis   <cit> . for v. dahliae, protoplasts were previously isolated using a combination of two enzymes  <cit> . in our study, we isolated protoplasts from v. dahliae by using a single enzyme driselase, with up to  <dig> % efficiency. the main differences in our protocol and that developed in the previous study  <cit>  are the number of spores they cultured for protoplasts isolation and the enzymolysis temperature. in our study  <dig>  × 107/ml spores were cultured for obtaining mycelia to be digested with the enzyme while they used 106/ml. we used  <dig> °c as the optimum enzymolysis temperature and  <dig> h old culture the best for protoplast isolations as compared to their  <dig> °c and  <dig> h old culture. there is a difference in the media used for the growth of mycelia as well between the two protocols that can also have a significant effect on the protoplast production .

the efficiency of protoplast isolation, in addition to the digestion enzyme and other factors, also depends on the age of the mycelia. young and exponentially growing mycelia are the best choices for protoplast isolation  <cit> , but the optimal age of the mycelia varies for different species, e.g.,  <dig> h for blakeslea trispora and  <dig> days for pleurotus pulmonarius and pleurotus florida  <cit> . for v. dahliae, previous studies have used 24-h-old mycelia for protoplast isolation  <cit> , but here we obtained more protoplasts from the 20-h culture than from the 24-h culture. the probable reason for this can be the sensitivity of the younger mycelia to the digesting enzymes, with the increase in growth the cell wall becomes thicker and the mycelia would be digested more difficultly leading to decreased protoplast yield  <cit> . in addition to the age of mycelia, the protoplast yield also depends on the duration of the enzyme digestion, which has ranged from  <dig> h to  <dig> h for maximum protoplast release in other fungal species  <cit> . the optimum time of enzymolysis in our study was  <dig>  h. less time is presumably not enough for all the mycelia to be digested by the enzyme, while prolonged enzymolyis can result in the breaking of protoplasts .

regeneration of protoplasts is a vital step and is the main limiting factor in a transformation experiment. thus, a high frequency of regeneration is necessary for genetic manipulation of the particular fungus. protoplasts from different fungi have been isolated with various regeneration frequencies, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % , partly depending on the media used to culture the protoplast. for example, the protoplast regeneration efficiencies for b. trispora and nodulisporium sylviforme were found to be  <dig>  % and  <dig> % on pda respectively while the regeneration frequencies decreased  with the use of other media  <cit> . in our study, the frequency of regeneration was about 5-fold higher in tb <dig> broth than in cm broth.

to increase the transformation efficiency of v. dahliae protoplasts, we also tested a number of protocols to determine the best one. transformation efficiency of various fungal species with peg has been variable, e.g.,  <dig> transformants/ <dig> μg dna for v. fungicola, 100- <dig> for the basidiomycete pleurotus ostreatus  <cit> , and for v. dahliae, 10– <dig> transformants/ <dig> μg dna  <cit> . we obtained much higher yields in our experiments:  <dig> transformants/ <dig> μg dna using the gfp plasmid  and  <dig> using the linear gfp cassette  and peg- <dig>  the higher frequency of transformation might be due to the high quality of protoplasts obtained. plasmid size also plays a vital role in the transformation efficiency. previous studies have indicated that increasing plasmid size results in decreased transformation efficiency  <cit> . the fewer transformants obtained with the gfp plasmid in comparison to the linear gfp cassette is thus probably due to the large size of the plasmid. on the other hand, transforming v. dahliae protoplast using electroporation did not yield promising results for either of the gfp plasmids. the main hurdle in electroporation is the regeneration of the protoplasts. as the voltage increases, the regeneration capacity of the protoplast decreases. at low voltage , the transformation efficiency ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> transformants/ <dig> μg dna for gfp plasmid and linear gfp cassette, respectively, much lower than with peg- <dig> 

rnai is a powerful reverse genetics tool for deciphering gene function in various organisms including fungi  <cit> . characterizing gene function using gene deletion, disruption or insertion is a time-consuming process. downregulation of a gene using rnai is an alternative method in functional genomics as it is a rapid process as compared to the deletion or disruption of a gene. moreover this approach is particularly helpful in studying essential genes or genes present in multiple copies within the genome that could compensate for each other’s function. in fungi, synthetic sirnas have been used to downregulate specific genes. for example, hmgr and fpps in fusarium sp. hkf <dig> were silenced by delivering sirnas designed against these genes into the protoplasts  <cit> . in another study, three sirna sequences  targeting the mrna sequence of the afld gene were tested for controlling aflatoxin production in aspergillus flavus and aspergillus parasiticus  <cit> . designing sirnas that are more effective at downregulating is essential for gene silencing. several sirnas designed from different sites within the same gene can have striking differences in silencing efficiency  <cit>  as shown by the silencing of the gfp gene at various efficiencies using different sirnas.

vta <dig> gene was used as a reference gene for sirna inhibition assay because its inhibition can easily be assessed from the colony growth  <cit> . after treating protoplasts obtained from vd-wt transformed with different sirnas designed for this gene, we observed a significant decrease in the colony diameter of the sirna-treated groups compared with the control group. differences in colony diameter were also observed among the sirna groups, indicating that sirna designed from different locations within the gene can have strikingly different silencing effects. the difference in the colony diameter among the sirna groups and the control groups lasted for about  <dig> days, sufficient time for characterizing a gene.

CONCLUSIONS
our improved method greatly increased the number of transformants per microgram of dna over the others available. this method will be useful for elucidating gene functions by downregulating a particular gene of interest using sirna and constructing gene deletion mutants of v. dahliae in a shorter time than required for atmt.
