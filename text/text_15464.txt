BACKGROUND
coeliac disease  is a common and complex inflammatory disorder of the small intestine that affects genetically susceptible individuals carrying hla-dq <dig> or -dq <dig> haplotypes. symptoms develop after ingestion of gluten storage proteins  from wheat , barley , rye , and their crossbred varieties  <cit> . cd can be diagnosed at any age. it can either be asymptomatic or present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. the classical  form of cd is usually characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms like flatulence, vomiting, constipation or persistent diarrhoea, general failure to thrive, mineral and vitamin deficiencies, and weight loss due to malabsorption. atypical forms, on the other hand, present predominantly with extra-intestinal manifestations that include a blistering skin disease , iron-deficiency anaemia, osteoporosis, fatigue and neurological complaints  <cit> . the prevalence of cd is estimated to be about 1% in the western populations  <cit> . moreover, in recent years the total disease prevalence has increased. the reason for the observed raise is currently unknown and cannot be explained by the increase of cd diagnosis that occurred after introduction of antibody screening  <cit> .

in cd patients, peptides that originate from incomplete digestion of gluten prolamins, either in their native form or deamidated by tissue transglutaminase , bind to hla-dq <dig> or -dq <dig> receptors of antigen presenting cells that activate the lamina propria infiltrating cd4+ t cells. as a response the cd4+ t cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular γ-interferon. ultimately, this leads to profound tissue remodelling characterised by the atrophy of the small intestinal villi and hyperplasia of crypts  <cit> . active cd is also characterised by high levels of antibodies against ttg and gliadin in the patients' sera. the role of anti-ttg iga class antibodies is still unclear. however, it has been proposed that they may be involved in the development of mucosal damage  <cit> . also igg class anti-gliadin antibodies have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis by activating the complement system or inducing antibody-mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> .

t cell epitopes in wheat gluten proteins have been characterised within both gliadins and glutenins. a hierarchy exists within these epitopes. the majority of cd patient-derived intestinal t cell clones recognise α-gliadins, and less frequently γ-gliadins and glutenins  <cit> . the most prominent peptide is a 33-mer of α-gliadins  that contains six t-cell epitopes. another fragments, also found in α-gliadins , seem to be important for the activation of the innate immunity system  <cit> . in a recent study gluten-specific t cells from peripheral blood of cd patients challenged either with wheat, barley, rye or a combination of the three cereals were used to identify the immunostimulatory sequences in these grains  <cit> . the α-gliadin 33-mer was found immunogenic only after the wheat challenge while sequences from ω-gliadin  and c-hordein  were found to be immunodominant despite the grain consumed.

currently there is no cure for cd. the only existing therapy is a life-long adherence to a gluten-free  diet  <cit> . however, several strategies that may in the future serve as alternatives to the gf diet have been proposed. t cell activation may be inhibited by molecules that block peptide binding to hla-dq <dig>  alternatively, inhibition of tissue transglutaminase may prevent gluten deamidation  <cit> . supplementation with prolyl endopeptidases , enzymes derived from moulds and bacterial strains, or with a mixture of pep and cysteine endoprotease from germinating barley, which aid in digestion of immunostimulatory gluten peptides into harmless molecules, is under investigation  <cit> . another possible therapeutic alternative that is currently pursued is a vaccine that contains a mixture of immunodominant peptides that trigger the immune response and are supposed to retrain the immune system of hla-dq <dig> positive cd subjects to tolerate gluten  <cit> . furthermore, an inhibitor of paracellular permeability  has been shown to reduce the intestinal barrier dysfunction, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and gi symptoms in cd individuals after gluten exposure  <cit> . moreover, attempts have been made to degrade toxic gluten sequences during sourdough fermentation with selected lactobacilli strains  <cit> . finally, the potential of a linear polymeric binder p to neutralise gliadin in vitro and in vivo in mice models have been described  <cit> . another alternative could be blocking gliadin domains with synthetic peptides and thus preventing ttg modification and formation of immunostimulatory epitopes.

in the present study we have selected in vitro gliadin-binding peptides with the help of phage display. phage display refers to a molecular method where gene libraries are constructed in filamentous bacteriophage in a way that each individual phage in the population will display a unique peptide or protein on its surface  <cit> . from such a population, phage that interact with in principle any a priori chosen molecule can be isolated and amplified. the concept has been used in many different variations to select and produce novel peptides that bind to target molecules of interest  <cit> . the aim of this work was to identify phage that express peptides specifically binding to different gliadin domains and to identify and characterise the gliadin-binding properties of the chosen individual peptides.

RESULTS
purification and immobilisation of gliadin proteins
gliadin was semi-purified from commercially obtained gluten  and from whole wheat grains as a comparison. several proteins of varying molecular weights were obtained from both sources . using a commercial gliadin elisa kit it was confirmed that the included anti-gliadin antibodies reacted with the semi-purified gliadin fractions. as a control, gliadin-like proteins  were extracted from oat grains but the commercial antibodies did not, as expected, react with the oat proteins . the gliadin preparation was finally dissolved in either  <dig>  m nahco <dig> or in  <dig> m urea, added to microtiter plate wells and allowed to bind to plastic. after washing, bound gliadin molecules were quantified with an elisa assay using the commercial human anti-gliadin igg antibodies. this confirmed that gliadins indeed had been immobilised to the wells and that the antibodies used recognised both the gliadin nahco3- and urea-treated molecules. however, the detection limit was reduced about  <dig> times when gliadins were dissolved in urea indicating that the 3d structure of the antibody-binding sites of gliadin were affected by the buffer used .

selection of peptides specifically binding to gliadin peptides by biopanning
two different phage display libraries, one displaying 12-mer and one displaying 7-mer random peptides, were panned to the immobilised gliadin. in each panning round unbound phage were removed by washing. remaining bound phage were eluted and allowed to infect e. coli cells. after single plaque amplification and phage purification a new round of panning was performed with the obtained phage population. panning was done both with gliadin dissolved in urea and in nahco <dig>  since electrostatic binding of the phage to the target protein weakens with increasing ionic strength, which in turn influences the specificity of the interaction  <cit> , different buffers with different ionic strengths were tested prior the actual panning experiments. after optimising parameters like binding, washing, and elution conditions, a protocol was developed in which the phage recovery increased after each round of panning. typically five rounds of panning were done. after the final plating,  <dig> plaques were randomly picked and amplified separately. phage dna was then isolated from each isolate, the oligonucleotide inserts sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequence of the displayed peptide determined.

in total, inserted individual oligomer sequences from approximately  <dig> phage, selected under a number of different panning conditions, were obtained. although identical sequences were frequently picked up in independent experiments, altogether more than  <dig> unique sequences encoding peptides with potential gliadin binding activities were identified . all obtained sequences originated from the 12-mer library. many of the peptides could be crudely divided into subgroups based on sequence similarities. however, more than a half of the peptides showed no obvious sequence similarities to each other. this indicates that the peptide-targeted surfaces in the used gliadin preparations are much diversified.

as a control, panning against microtiter plates coated with bsa was performed. peptides identified in this way were denoted control peptides . altogether, five different cp sequences were identified. there were no sequence similarities between these control sequences and any of the gliadin binding sequences.

rescuing selected phage clones
in order to confirm that the selected phage clones interacted with gliadin proteins, nine different phage populations that had repeatedly been picked up in different panning experiments were chosen. together, these nine sequences represent 89% of all identified gliadin-binding sequences . the remaining approximately  <dig> sequences thus were found in only 11% of the cases. from each of the nine populations  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu were incubated with the gliadin-coated microtiter wells. in addition, a phage population representing a non gliadin-binding control sequence  was incubated with the gliadin-coated microtiter wells. after extensive washing, remaining phage were eluted and counted. this showed that phage carrying the cp <dig> control peptide were very poor binders, as only  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu were rescued from this population under the conditions used. from the phage that carry specific peptides, on the other hand more than  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu were rescued . phage p <dig>  which was the was most frequently picked up in the panning experiments, displayed the highest relative binding affinity, while phage carrying peptides p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> showed intermediate affinities .

selected phage clones hinder anti-gliadin antibody binding to gliadin
to investigate if the selected, gliadin-interacting phage could hinder antibody binding to gliadin,  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu of the same nine phage populations as in the previous experiment  were added to wells coated with  <dig> ng gliadin. the cp <dig> phage population as well as a buffer solution without phage were used as controls. to investigate if the peptides not only interfered with commercial anti-gliadin antibody binding but also interfered with the interaction between gliadin and antibodies present in serum from individuals with suspected cd, after extensive washing, pooled sera from  <dig> individuals was added. again, the amount of bound antibody was quantified by adding an ap-labelled secondary anti-human igg antibody. this showed that the greatest signals i.e. most antibodies bound were from the controls where no gliadin-blocking peptides were present . on the other hand, all the selected phage populations blocked the signal to various extents, indicating that the peptides displayed on the phage interfered with the anti-gliadin antibody-gliadin interaction. wells incubated with phage populations p <dig> and p <dig> gave the lowest signal indicating, in agreement with the previous experiment , that these were the most efficient gliadin binders.

gliadin binding of synthetic peptides
since all selections were based on phage-displayed peptides, we investigated whether synthetic peptides, with the same sequence as those in the selected phage, maintained the gliadin-binding ability also when removed from the steric context of the phage surface. peptides based on the most frequently identified sequences, p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  as well as the non-specifically binding control peptide cp <dig>  were synthesised. a biotin label was added at the n-terminus of all the peptides to facilitate detection. to test peptide-gliadin binding, different concentrations of gliadin proteins  were immobilised in microtiter wells and  <dig> molecules  of the synthetic peptides were added to the wells. after incubation and extensive washing to remove unbound peptides the biotin signals from the remaining peptides were quantified. the results showed that p <dig> had the highest binding activity, p <dig> somewhat weaker, and p <dig> the weakest binding activity , corroborating the experiments with the phage carrying peptides . no activity at all could be detected from the incubations with the control peptide. as expected, the number of bound peptides increased with increasing gliadin concentrations .

gliadin-blocking activity of selected synthetic peptides
to confirm that the free peptides could block anti-gliadin antibody-gliadin interactions with similar efficiency as the phage-displayed peptide,  <dig>  nmoles  of the synthetic peptides were mixed with increasing concentrations of gliadin , followed by an incubation of the peptide/gliadin mixture in anti-gliadin antibody coated wells. after incubation and washing away unbound gliadin and peptides, a secondary antibody binding to the solid phase antibody-antigen complex was added, and the amount of complex quantified by means of the tag on the secondary antibody. this showed that the p <dig> and p <dig> peptides interfered with or blocked antigenic sites on the gliadin molecules, since fewer signals were obtained with these peptides than with p <dig>  cp <dig> and the no peptide control . furthermore, the blocking effect was visible in the whole concentration range  of gliadin tested .

to further test the binding efficiencies of the peptides, two best peptides p <dig> and p <dig> and the control peptide cp <dig> were diluted in several steps and incubated with  <dig> ng of gliadin followed the incubation in the antibody-coated microtiter wells. this showed that as little as  <dig> peptide molecules  could interfere with the anti-gliadin antibody-gliadin interactions to a level detectable in the experiment .

dot blot and western blot analysis
to further verify the physical interaction of the peptides and gliadin, and to elucidate if the peptides preferentially bind to specific proteins in the semi-purified gliadin fraction used here, dot blot and western blot experiments were performed. in the dot blot experiments, increasing concentrations  of the gliadin preparation were spotted on filters. the filters were then incubated with either of the p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> or cp <dig> peptides, and subsequently washed. bound peptides were quantified with an anti-biotin ap-labelled antibody recognising the biotin tag on the peptides. the results from these analyses again confirmed that the peptides physically interacted with gliadin and as previously, the p <dig> peptide had the highest binding activity, followed by the p <dig> peptide. no binding could be detected with the p <dig> and the cp <dig> peptides .

in the western blot experiments, gliadin proteins were separated on sds-page gels and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. by using the p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> or cp <dig> peptides as probes and again detecting peptides bound to the filter by means of the secondary ap-labelled anti-biotin antibody it became clear that, as in the dot blot experiments, p <dig> and p <dig> showed the strongest binding . both these peptides interacted with proteins in the 29- <dig> kda range, and in addition p <dig> also bound to proteins between 49- <dig> kda. thus, the two peptides have overlapping but distinct binding specificities. a similar pattern was obtained both when analysing the gliadin extracted from sigma gluten and gliadin extracted from wheat .

discussion
wheat gluten consists of a complex mixture of proteins that based on their common structures can be divided into three groups: a high molecular weight  group that contains hmw-glutenin subunits with mr ~67- <dig> kda; a medium molecular weight  group containing ω-gliadin proteins with mr ~34- <dig> kda; and a low molecular weight  group with α/β-, γ-gliadins and lmw-glutenin subunits with mr ~28- <dig> kda  <cit> . several of the glutenin and gliadin proteins contain repeated proline and glutamine residues, especially qqpfp and pqqpf motifs, which are resistant to complete digestion by gastric and pancreatic enzymes  <cit> . the repeats can trigger immune response and appear to be especially important for the specific gluten peptide recognition by cd4+ t cells  <cit> . previously, it was shown that phage display might be a useful technology to identify peptides that bind to gliadin residues, although no sequences were shown  <cit> . here, we extended this work to include several different gliadin proteins to increase the probability of identifying phage that bound to reactive surfaces . glutamine residues within gliadin can be deamidated by tissue transglutaminase , which will further enhance the pathologic immune response  <cit> . if blocking peptides efficiently inhibit recognition of gliadin by ttg they will most probably aid in limiting the development of t cell epitopes. in a recently published study we have shown that when in complexes with the selected blocking peptides, the in vitro enzymatic modification of gliadin by ttg was reduced by ~one-third  <cit> .

there is no cure for cd. the only available therapy is a life-long exclusion of gluten from a diet. the variety of bakery and pastry gluten-free products is limited and the price is higher than their gluten containing equivalents  <cit> . moreover, these products often do not meet the dietary requirements, as they tend to be high in fat and low in fibre as compared to gluten-containing equivalents  <cit> . furthermore, naturally gluten-free grains and flours can be contaminated with gluten during fieldwork, transport, processing or in a store if grains are kept in open containers  <cit> . one alternative strategy would be to neutralise minor contaminations in e.g. oat, rice or maize products by mixing in molecules that block or digest the harmful motifs in gluten molecules  <cit> . gluten-blocking peptides, like the ones described in this work, could perhaps be one way to detoxify disease-inducing gluten peptides in the future.

by using a number of different panning conditions and gliadin proteins dissolved in either urea or nahco <dig> a large number of phage displaying different peptide sequences has been identified. to investigate if the identified peptides could interfere with the human anti-gliadin antibody and gliadin interaction, we mixed peptide-carrying phage with gliadin and pooled sera originating from patients with suspected cd. in that way we demonstrated that the phage indeed inhibited interactions between gliadin and human anti-gliadin antibody . for these analyses we used patient sera from a biobank. the sera were selected for having high titers of anti-gliadin antibodies  and positive or high titers of anti-transglutaminase iga antibodies, although we had no specific information regarding the patients' clinical diagnosis. the production of anti-gliadin antibodies is not specific to coeliac disease since slightly elevated serum concentrations are also found in other gastrointestinal disorders and even in normal individuals  <cit> . however, the levels of anti-gliadin antibodies in patients without coeliac disease seem to be much lower compared to our selected serum samples  <cit> . as our patients had high levels of both anti-gliadin and anti-transglutaminase antibodies it is likely that they had cd.

to verify whether the peptides, also when removed from the context of the phage, could interact with gliadin, we synthesised three peptides that were repeatedly identified in independent panning experiments and one control peptide that only interacted with bsa. we could then show that two of the peptides, p <dig> and p <dig> indeed interfered with the gliadin anti-gliadin antibody binding . in this case, two different monoclonal anti-gliadin antibodies provided by a commercial kit were used. in addition, by means of the biotin label attached to the peptides, we also showed in western blot experiments that p <dig> and p <dig> could bind to several of the separated and immobilised gliadin proteins .

since we have so far only studied the nine gliadin-binding peptides that were most often picked up, we still have more than  <dig> additional peptides to test. most likely, several of these peptides will also bind to gliadin. since all individual peptides will bind to different sites on the gliadin complex, pooling of several different peptides could generate synergistic effects, and it should be possible to develop this concept in the direction of a drug against cd. however, many more experiments have to be performed, addressing issues like the stability of the peptide-gliadin interaction in chemical conditions likely to be encountered in the gut or in food preparation, the characterization of the actual binding sites in more detail, and the interaction with digestive enzymes and tissue transglutaminase etc. before any conclusions about the usefulness of these peptides in a therapeutic situation can be drawn.

CONCLUSIONS
finally, there are still several unanswered questions on the role of gliadin in the development of cd. some of the gliadin-binding peptides presented here, labelled in different ways, could provide valuable tools for researchers in the field of cd to study localisation and uptake of various gliadin peptides in the small intestine.
