BACKGROUND
accurate and reliable detection of viable pathogenic bacteria in complex matrices like manure and biosolids is a major challenge. few molecular methods have been developed to differentiate viable from dead cells. reverse transcription-pcr  has been used to study the behavior of viable pathogenic bacteria in manured soil  <cit>  and in sludge  <cit> . however, its use is limited by the difficulty in extracting high quality rna, by the instability of rna, and by variations caused by the physiological condition of the cells  <cit> . the live/dead baclight viability assay can detect viable bacteria but this microscopic method is not suitable for environmental matrices due to interactions between the dye and organic matter  <cit> . ethidium monoazide  or propidium monoazide  coupled with real-time quantitative pcr  have been used to distinguish viable from dead bacteria  <cit> . these dna intercalating dyes selectively enter cells with compromised membrane and bind covalently to dna after photoactivation, thus preventing subsequent pcr amplification  <cit> . comparative studies showed that pma outperformed ema in the selective removal of dead cells  <cit> . despite its advantages over ema, there is evidence that pma has limitations when applied to complex environmental matrices  <cit> . high levels of total suspended solids  or biomass in sludge or in water samples appeared to interfere with the ability of the pma-qpcr method to quantify viable bacteria  <cit> . indeed, the high organic matter content in sludge and manures and the high turbidity of these matrices may interfere with the photoactivation process. in addition, organic matter provides chemically active cation exchange sites that may retain the pma and consequently reduce the available concentration of dye  <cit> . questions therefore still remain about the applicability of pma in such matrices.

several methodological parameters may affect pma efficiency. among them, the concentration of the dye, the length of light exposure and of incubation appear to be key parameters  <cit>  that require optimization for the reliable quantification of dead microorganisms. studies on the use of pma to quantify non-viable bacteria in effluents are rare and are all based on the works of nocker et al.  <cit>  and luo et al.  <cit> . in these studies, the samples were exposed to a 600-650-w halogen light source placed at a distance of 20 cm from the tubes and light exposure time ranged from  <dig> to 20 min depending on the experiment . the incubation time in the dark also varied, ranging from five  <cit>  to 10 min  <cit> , while pma concentrations ranged from 2 μm  <cit>  to 300 μm  <cit> . due to the lack of data on livestock and urban effluents, the optimal conditions of the pma application are still not clear and require further investigation.

as a model for the present study, we used listeria monocytogenes, a pathogen that has been reported to enter a viable but nonculturable  state  <cit>  and whose presence has been reported in both urban and animal effluents  <cit> . we determined the optimal conditions of the pma-qpcr method in two types of piggery effluents that differed in their chemical and physical properties: raw manure and biologically treated liquid manure . to this end, we compared the quantification of living  and heat-killed  cultured l. monocytogenes cells using pma-qpcr, qpcr and a cultural method. to simultaneously study the effect of  the concentration of pma, the length of light exposure and of incubation in the dark and  the interaction of these three factors, a response surface method based on a doehlert design and a desirability function were applied to identify the optimal conditions for the quantification of vbnc cells of l. monocytogenes. to check the applicability of the method, the optimal conditions we identified were tested on nine piggery effluents.

RESULTS
use of the desirability approach to determine the optimal conditions for pma pretreatment
we studied the concentration of pma, incubation time and photoactivation time in a raw manure and in a lagoon effluent using an experimental design matrix based on a doehlert design . the lowest Δdead values were  <dig>  in the lagoon effluent and  <dig>  log <dig> cfu-eq in the manure. it is noteworthy that the maximum theoretical Δdead value  depended on the concentration of inoculated cells and on the limit of quantification of the qpcr. this maximum value was reached for  <dig> and  <dig> combinations of factors in manure and lagoon effluent, respectively. the values of Δviable ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  log <dig> cfu-eq in manure and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  log <dig> cfu-eq in lagoon effluent, demonstrating that the combination of the three methodological factors affected the efficiency of the pma-qpcr.table  <dig> design matrix of the doehlert uniform shell design for  <dig> factors and corresponding responses

the minimum value of Δviable was observed for a pma concentration of 20 μm, an incubation time of  <dig>  min and a photoactivation time of 29 min in both matrices. under these conditions, the Δdead value reached the limit of quantification in the lagoon but was  <dig>  log <dig> cfu-eq in the manure, indicating an underestimation of  <dig>  log <dig> cfu-eq of the dead cells in this matrix.

the estimated effects of the three independent factors with their second-order interactions on the Δviable and Δdead responses are presented on the standardized pareto charts in fig.  <dig>  which graphically displays the magnitude of the effects according to the statistical analysis of the experimental data. the effects are ranked in descending order. analysis of the data showed that the significance of the variables depends on the nature of the matrix. when viable l. monocytogenes was inoculated in manure, the pma concentration were the most important factor affecting the Δviable values . the two other factors had little or no significant effect on the Δviable values. on the other hand, when viable bacteria were inoculated in the lagoon, only the length of the photoactivation period had a positive effect on the Δviable values . the interpretation of the significance of the factors obtained with the dead cells was more difficult given the high number of similar responses corresponding to runs in which the limit of quantification of the qpcr was reached. this may explain the low significance of the three factors observed in the lagoon effluent  and the high number of factors and interactions influencing the Δdead values in manure . nevertheless, overall, the reduction in Δviable and the increase in Δdead values were mainly affected by the concentration of pma and /or the length of the photoactivation period, whereas incubation time had less impact.fig.  <dig> pareto chart of the individual, quadratic and interactive effect of pma concentration , incubation time  and photoactivation time  on the Δviable  and Δdead  values in samples of manure and lagoon effluents



according to the results of the doehlert design, it is clear that  the type of matrix played a role in the effect of the factors and  the Δviable and Δdead responses were contradictory. in order to find the best compromise between the two responses, a composite desirability function was calculated by simultaneous minimization of the Δviable response and maximization of the Δdead response. statgraphics centurion xvi software was used to calculate the optimal conditions. the results of the predicted values of the desirability function for each run of the doehlert design are listed in table  <dig>  the three factors needed to maximize desirability for the manure  differed from those needed for the lagoon effluent . the optimal conditions to achieve the highest value of the overall desirability function were 55 μm pma, 5 min incubation and 56 min photoactivation for manure and 20 μm pma, 20 min incubation and 30 min photoactivation for lagoon effluent, all of which were computed by statgraphics centurion xvi software.table  <dig> predicted values of the desirability function at each point conditions set for manure and lagoon

applying the optimal conditions to manures and lagoon effluents
the optimal conditions determined by the desirability function were applied to five manures and four lagoon effluents inoculated with viable and heat-killed l. monocytogenes cells to estimate the effect of the matrices on the Δviable and the Δdead responses with the same pma pretreatment. the physico-chemical characteristics and responses are listed in table  <dig>  the Δviable responses ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  log <dig>  regardless of the matrix, seven of the nine Δviable responses resulted in slight underestimation of the viable l. monocytogenes cells . in seven of the nine samples, the observed Δdead were close to the theoretical maximum value of Δdead , suggesting the underestimation of heat-killed cells was very small. two manure samples  had a lower Δdead value than those of the other samples, resulting in a  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> underestimation of dead cells, respectively. as, except for samples m <dig> and m <dig>  the Δdead responses were close to the limit of quantification, only the relationships among Δviable responses and physico-chemical parameters were analyzed. the turbidity of the lagoons was positively correlated with Δviable  whereas none of the factors were correlated with Δviable in manure, confirming that turbidity played a major role in the less turbid matrix.table  <dig> physico-chemical parameters and Δviable and Δdead responses  after pma pretreatment of  <dig> manures and  <dig> lagoon effluents

discussion
the dna-intercalating agent pma was used in combination with qpcr for the detection of the viability of bacterial cells. this rapid method does not require cell culture and is consequently particularly attractive for the detection of pathogenic bacteria that can enter a viable but nonculturable  state such as l. monocytogenes  <cit> . pma has been used on a wide range of microorganisms  and successfully tested on simple matrices such as broth culture or water samples . however, the complex nature of environmental matrices  has been shown to influence the effectiveness of the pma-qpcr  <cit> . factors such as turbidity and the concentration of solids , ph  <cit> , and of organic matter  <cit>  may reduce the efficiency of dye pretreatment. indeed, the presence of solids and organic matter in urban effluents and sludge interferes with the penetration of pma into microorganisms with compromised cell membrane integrity , resulting in underestimation of the number of dead cells. one suggested way of overcoming this bias is diluting the environmental matrices. however, this reduces the concentration of the target organism and, as a result, reduces the sensitivity of the method.

although the efficiency of pma-qpcr, pma may also be affected by methodological factors such as the concentration of pma, the length of photoactivation and incubation  <cit> , the combination of the three factors tested on effluents and sludge in published literature were mostly similar .

the results of our experiments performed on raw pig manure, a brown matrix containing 20 g l- <dig> tss and lagoon effluent, which was less colored and contained about  <dig> times less tss, revealed that the efficiency of the pma treatment is influenced by the type of effluent and thus require optimization of the methodological factors. the optimal combination of the three factors obtained with the desirability function clearly differed between the manure and the lagoon samples. the analysis of the data of the doehlert design identified the concentration of pma in the manure and the photoactivation time in the lagoon effluent as the factors that most influenced Δviable responses, whereas incubation time was less significant. these results suggest that in turbid matrices such as manure or sludge, the photoactivation time plays a minor role compared to the concentration of pma and vice versa in less turbid matrices.

the significance and the interaction of factors affecting the Δdead responses were less clear due to the high limit of quantification of the qpcr, which was reached in  <dig> and 38 % of the experimental runs in lagoon effluent and in manure, respectively . experiments performed in broth or water with a pure culture of dead cells resulted in a reduction of the cell quantification of between  <dig> and  <dig> log <dig> after pma or ema pretreatment  <cit> . in complex matrices, the rate of reduction was lower, around  <dig> log <dig>  <cit>  or was not satisfactory  <cit>  due to the presence of pcr inhibitors and of solids, which react with the pma. in our study, when the optimal conditions provided by the desirability function were applied in nine piggery effluent samples, the Δviable and Δdead values were generally close to their target values.

as the quantification of dead cells depends on the activation of the acid nucleic-bound dye, quantification could be improved by replacing the halogen lamp used in this study by 460 nm leds, which have the advantage of emitting light at a wavelength close to the maximum absorption of pma  and do not generate heat  <cit> . moreover, it should be noted that the length of the target gene may also affect the effectiveness of the dye. longer amplicons appear to be more appropriate than shorter ones to reflect the extent of cell death induced by the pma or ema-pretreatment . however, amplification of long fragments  increases the likelihood of the formation of secondary structures, thereby reducing pcr efficiency. in our study, the small size of the target fragment , does not appear to have negatively influenced the quantification of the dead cells, as most of the nine signals were very close to threshold of the qpcr.

the efficiency of the pma pretreatment also depends on the target microorganism, which may complicate the selection of the optimal combination of factors  <cit> . furthermore, factors such as the ratio of dead cells to viable cells may influence the efficiency of the pma pretreatment  <cit> . it should be noted that the piggery effluents tested in our study probably contained a substantial number of cells with damaged membranes that may incorporate pma and hence interfere with the quantification of the target amplicon after pma treatment.

in our study, the efficiency of the pma pretreatment was not impacted by the range of ph , but depended on the type of effluents, which mainly differed in their tss contents and turbidity . bae and wuertz  <cit>  and taskin et al.  <cit>  reported that tss contents > 1 g l− <dig> and 4 g l− <dig>  respectively, interfered with the cross-linking of pma, leading to underestimation of heat-treated cells. wagner et al.  <cit>  reported that the black color of digested sludge limited light penetration thus preventing the crosslinking step of the dye. similarly, li et al.  <cit>  pointed out that sludge inhibits the efficiency of pma due to the presence of dark particles or inhibitory substances. data on pma reported by luo et al.  <cit>  suggest that turbidity has an effect on pma treatment when the turbidity of samples is more than  <dig> ntu. however, our data showed that even when turbidity ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> ntu, pma adequately distinguished between viable and dead cells of l. monocytogenes.

in our study, as the optimal combination of the three factors was estimated taking into account the difference in composition of the two matrices, the variations in the tss levels in the samples of manure  and in samples of lagoon effluent  had no significant impact on the Δviable values. nevertheless, the two manures with the highest level of tss led to the greater underestimation of the number of dead cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in our experimental conditions , the use of the two combinations of factors selected according the type of matrix based on the desirability function, allowed us to accurately estimate the number of viable and dead cells of l. monocytogenes in both manure and lagoon effluent. our results confirm that pma-qpcr can be used on undiluted turbid effluent provided that preliminary tests are performed to estimate the optimal conditions for a given matrix.
