BACKGROUND
asparagine-linked glycosylation  of proteins is the most ubiquitous post-translational modification in eukaryotes, all archaea, and some eubacteria  <cit> . oligosaccharyltransferase  catalyzes the transfer of an oligosaccharide chain from a lipid-linked oligosaccharide  donor to the asparagine residues in the n-glycosylation sequon, asn-x-ser/thr   <cit> . in higher eukaryotes, ost is a multi-subunit and membrane-associated protein complex, whereas the osts from lower eukaryotes, archaea and eubacteria are single-subunit membrane proteins  <cit> . the catalytic subunit of the ost enzyme is the only subunit conserved evolutionally across the three domains of life, and it is referred to as stt <dig>  in eukaryotes, aglb  in archaea, and pglb  in eubacteria. the stt3/aglb/pglb proteins share a common overall architecture, consisting of an n-terminal multi-spanning transmembrane region and a c-terminal globular domain  <cit> . despite the very low overall sequence identity, multiple sequence alignments revealed a few short conserved motifs: two diacidic dxd motifs in the n-terminal transmembrane region, and a well-conserved 5-residue wwdyg motif in the c-terminal globular domain  <cit> . we previously determined the crystal structures of the c-terminal globular domains of four aglb proteins and one pglb protein  <cit> . the structural comparison revealed the common structural unit and the unique structural units specific to each protein. in addition, structure-aided sequence alignment led to the discovery of new short motifs, the dk and mi motifs, based on the fact that the two motifs are located at spatially equivalent positions close to the wwdyg motif  <cit> . the consensus sequences of the dk and mi motifs are dxxkxxx and mxxixxx, respectively, where x means any amino acid residue. since the side chains of the signature residues of the two motifs have very different chemical properties , the identification of the new motifs would have been almost impossible without reference to the three-dimensional structures.

in  <dig>  the crystal structure of full-length campylobacter lari pglb, in a complex with an acceptor peptide, was reported at  <dig>  Å resolutions  <cit> . this structure revealed several important features of the stt3/aglb/pglb protein, including 1) the catalytically important acidic residues and a divalent metal ion in the transmembrane region, 2) the putative amide nitrogen activation mechanism of the side chain of the acceptor asparagine residue, and 3) the binding pocket in the c-terminal globular domain that recognizes the serine and threonine residues at the + <dig> position in the n-glycosylation sequon. the locations of the short amino acid motifs seem to correspond well with these functionally important structures. the conserved acidic residues in the two dxd motifs are involved in divalent ion coordination and amide nitrogen activation. trp-trp-asp part of the conserved wwdyg motif and the second signature residue, ile, of the mi motif in the pglb protein constitute the ser/thr-binding pocket.

based on the presence of the dk or mi motif, we classified the stt3/aglb/pglb proteins into two groups. all pglb and some aglb proteins contain the mi motif, whereas all stt <dig> and the remaining aglb proteins contain the dk motif or its variant type  <cit> . thus, there are two types of ser/thr-binding pockets: the lys-type and the ile-type, according to the second signature residue in the dk/mi motif. mutagenesis studies proved the essential roles of the second signature residue for the enzymatic activity. the substitution of the lysine residue with alanine in yeast stt <dig> resulted in a lethal phenotype  <cit>  and the substitutions with seven different amino acid residues in p. furiosus aglb-l resulted in the reduction of the in vitro activity  <cit> . the replacement of the isoleucine residue by alanine also substantially decreased the in vitro activities of the c. jejuni <cit>  and c. lari pglbs  <cit> .

the genome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon, archaeoglobus fulgidus, encodes three aglb paralogous genes. we have named the aglb paralogs with a letter plus an optional number, such as l  or s <dig> . the long aglb  consists of  <dig> residues and is called afaglb-l, and the other two short aglbs  consist of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, and are called afaglb-s <dig> and afaglb-s <dig>  respectively. afaglb-s <dig> and afaglb-s <dig> are the shortest among the currently known stt3/aglb/pglb proteins, and they share 68% sequence identity. in contrast, afaglb-l only shares 25% identities with afaglb-s <dig> and afaglb-s <dig>  it would be interesting to elucidate the distinct and complementary roles of the multiple ost enzymes in one organism. mammalian cells have two stt <dig> paralogs, stt3a and stt3b, which form different ost isoforms with the other seven subunits. the stt3a-containing ost isoform is the central player in the co-translational n-glycosylation of the nascent polypeptide chains, and the stt3b-containing ost isoform mediates the co- and post-translational n-glycosylations of unmodified glycosylation sites missed by the stt3a-ost isoform  <cit> . the protozoan parasite trypanosoma brucei has three stt <dig> paralogs, stt3a, stt3b, and stt3c, and the three stt <dig> proteins constitute the three single-subunit ost enzymes. these enzymes have different specificities for the oligosaccharide moieties of the llo donors and peptide acceptor sites  <cit> . for example, stt3a has stricter specificity for a particular type of lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor, and for glycosylation sites flanked by acidic residues, as compared to the other stt <dig> paralogs. in contrast, little is known about the different roles of the aglb paralogs in archaea.

we previously determined the crystal structures of the c-terminal globular domains of afaglb-s <dig> and afaglb-s <dig>  at  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å resolutions, respectively  <cit> . in the present study, we determined the crystal structure of the c-terminal globular domain of afaglb-l, as a fusion with maltose binding protein, at  <dig>  Å resolutions. the three structures provide a complete overview of the three aglb paralogs encoded in the a. fulgidus genome. the information about their structural similarities and differences will be helpful to elucidate the distinct roles of the aglb paralogs not only in a. fulgidus, but also in other archaea.

RESULTS
crystallization of the c-terminal globular domain of afaglb-l fused to maltose binding protein
the primary sequence of the full-length afaglb-l protein consists of the n-terminal transmembrane region  and the c-terminal globular domain . first, we expressed the c-terminal globular domain of afaglb-l in e. coli cells, and purified large quantities of the soluble protein. although the protein was crystallized in a reproducible manner, the crystals only diffracted to low resolution. next, we tried a fusion with e. coli k <dig> maltose binding protein , since successful examples of structure determinations using fusion proteins with mbp have been reported  <cit> . we connected mbp to the c-terminal globular domain of afaglb-l, without a flexible linker sequence between them. this fusion protein is referred to as mbp-saglb. we added a his tag at the n-terminus of mbp, for ni-affinity chromatography. amylose-affinity chromatography was not used for purification, because we wanted to test the apo and maltose-bound forms of mbp in the crystallization screening. in fact, mbp-saglb crystallized only in the apo form in the absence of maltose, and the crystals diffracted to high resolution.

mbp-saglb forms a swapped dimer in the crystal
mbp-saglb was crystallized in the monoclinic space group c <dig>  with one monomer per asymmetric unit. the structure was solved to  <dig>  Å resolution by the molecular replacement method using the structure of the maltose-free form of mbp  as the search model . the positions of selenium atoms in the anomalous difference fourier map calculated from the se-sad  data of the selenomethionine -substituted mbp-saglb was helpful to interpret discontinuous electron densities corresponding to the c-terminal domain of afaglb-l. the final model of mbp-saglb was refined to rwork and rfree of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. data collection and refinement statistics are listed in table  <dig>  in the final model, residues  <dig> to  <dig> in mbp were missing, as well as residues  <dig> to  <dig> in afaglb-l. interestingly, the c-terminal α-helix of mbp and the n-terminal α-helix of afaglb-l were fused to form a long, continuous α-helical structure, which fixed the relative orientations of mbp and afaglb-l in the crystal. this rigid connection may have facilitated the crystal growth. apart from the direct covalent connection, the interactions between the c-terminal domain of afaglb-l and mbp occurred but appeared minimal. the contact area was as small as 160 Å <dig>  where two residues of mbp  and two residues of afaglb-l  were involved. thus, we concluded that no severe distortion was induced in the structure of the c-terminal domain of afaglb-l by the extra noncovalent interactions within the fusion protein.

we found that the two molecules of mbp-saglb exhibited an intertwined structure, related by a 2-fold rotational axis in the crystal . this is not surprising, because there are many examples of intertwined structures in crystals  <cit> . the hinge loop region is defined as the segment that links the swapped segment to the rest of the protein. we found that the asn568-pro-phe-gln-ala-gly <dig> segment in the afaglb-l portion was the hinge loop region . the mbp-saglb protein eluted as a monomer  in gel filtration chromatography . thus, the formation of the intertwined dimer is a crystallographic artifact and lacks biological significance. we created a monomeric image of the c-terminal globular domain of afaglb-l, by restoring the swapped segment . the swapping was performed between a <dig> and g <dig>  and the restored molecule consists of  <dig> residues  from one molecule, and  <dig> residues  from another molecule related by a 2-fold axis in the crystal.

overall structure of the c-terminal globular domain of afaglb-l
the overall structure of the c-terminal domain of afaglb-l consists of three structural units, called cc , is , and p <dig>  . we compared the new structure with the previously determined structures : afaglb-s <dig>  afaglb-s <dig>  campylobacter jejuni pglb , pyrococcus furiosus aglb-l , and p. horikoshii aglb-l . in addition to the common structural unit cc , the c-terminal domains of the most aglb/pglb contain additional unique structural units, is , p <dig> , and/or p <dig> . in contrast, afaglb-s <dig> and afaglb-s <dig> only consists of the cc unit, indicating the indispensable role of the cc unit for the catalytic activity of the ost enzyme. in accordance with this notion, the cc units of the six structures share overall structural similarity. the cc unit features a mixed α/β fold, and contains the conserved wwdyg and dk/mi motifs . the length of the cc unit of afaglb-l  is longer than those of the other five aglb/pglb proteins . the additional sequence forms three α-helices , which is unique among the six structures . the is unit is referred to as an insertion, because it seemed to be inserted into the amino acid sequence of the cc unit. the is unit is a 9-stranded β-barrel-like structure in pfaglb-l, phaglb-l, and cjpglb, but in afaglb-l, it is smaller and differs from the β-barrel-like structure. the unique cluster of the three α-helices in the cc unit appears to substitute for the small is unit in the afaglb-l structure. the p <dig> unit of afaglb-l is β-sheet rich and occupies a similar spatial position to those in pfaglb-l and phaglb-l, but the arrangement of the β-strands is also different. thus, the other structural units besides the cc unit may have special roles in each ost enzyme. for example, they may contribute toward the increased thermal stability of the aglb proteins in the hyperthermophilic archaea, archaeoglobus and pyrococcus.

kinked helix with a short insertion sequence
the dk/mi motif resides on the characteristic kinked helix in the cc structural unit . the kinked helix consists of the n-terminal α-helical half and the c-terminal 310-helical half. in our previous studies, we found that the afaglb-s <dig> and afaglb-s <dig> structures both contained an insertion sequence at the junction site of the two helical structures . we concluded that the dk/mi motif of the two afaglb proteins was a variant type of the dk motif with an insertion. since this unexpected insertion separated the first and second signature residues of the dk motif in the primary structure, the identification of the variant type of dk motif would have been almost impossible without reference to the three-dimensional structures . the consensus sequence of the variant type of dk motif was defined as e<>kxxx, where <> denotes the inserted sequence with a variable length  <cit> . in spite of the existence of abundant information, we could not clearly identify the dk/mi motif of afaglb-l, due to the presence of redundant acidic residues in this region. by reference to the present afaglb-l structure, we concluded that the kinked helix of afaglb-l contained a four-residue insertion between the first and second signature residues, glu <dig> and lys <dig>  respectively, of the variant type of dk motif. the spatial arrangement of the signature residues in afaglb-l is identical to those in afaglb-s <dig> and afaglb-s <dig> .

the ser/thr-binding pocket in various aglb and pglb structures
we focused our attention on the ser/thr-binding pocket in the cc unit. the ser/thr-binding pocket was first identified in c. lari pglb, in a complex with a substrate peptide . the canonical structure of the ser/thr pocket was also found in the previously determined afaglb-s <dig> structure and the present afaglb-l structure . since both of the archaeoglobus aglb proteins were crystallized in the absence of peptide substrates, we concluded that the ser/thr pocket was formed prior to peptide binding. the pglb protein contains the mi motif, whereas the two archaeoglobus aglb proteins contain the dk motif. thus, we also concluded that the ser/thr-binding pocket is a functional structure present in all of the ost enzymes, independently of the dk or mi motif.

in contrast, afaglb-s <dig> has a deformed structure of the ser/thr-binding pocket  <cit> . the side chain of the tyrosine residue in the wwdyg motif protrudes in a different direction, and the α-helix following the wwdyg motif  is also oriented differently . indeed, we also found considerable conformational variation of the wwdyg motif in pfaglb-l and phaglb-l  <cit> . we inferred that this phenomenon suggested the remarkable plasticity of the wwdyg motif, and hence the flexibility of the ser/thr pocket. indeed, the dynamic nature of the wwdyg motif and the following α-helix was confirmed in an nmr relaxation study of the c-terminal domain of afaglb-s <dig> in the absence of substrates  <cit> . we speculate that the transient collapse of the ser/thr pocket must occur during the catalytic cycle, although the ser/thr pocket in the c-terminal domain has a canonical structure in the resting state and a peptide-bound state, as represented by afaglb-l, afaglb-s <dig>  and cjpglb, in the absence, and by clpglb, in the presence of a substrate acceptor peptide, respectively. the necessity of multiple conformational states in the enzymatic activity was suggested by a biochemical experiment using pfaglb-l, in which the flexibility restriction forced by an engineered disulfide bond abolished the enzymatic activity, but its cleavage fully restored the activity  <cit> . interestingly, in the crystal structure of mbp-saglb, the domain swapping site is located in the segment corresponding to the flexible region identified in afaglb-s <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the crystal structure of the c-terminal globular domain of one of the three oligosac-charyltransferases in the hyperthermophilic archaeon, archaeoglobus fulgidus . the crystallization of the fusion protein with mbp afforded high quality protein crystals. the c-terminal domain of afaglb-l consists of three structural units, cc, is, and p <dig> . multiple sequence alignments in the region corresponding to the kinked helix in the cc unit were particularly difficult in the archaeal classes archaeoglobi, halobacteria and methanomicrobia, due to the vast sequence diversity and abundance of acidic residues. the present afaglb-l structure, together with the previously deter-mined afaglb-s <dig> and afaglb-s <dig> structures, provided the structure-guided sequence alignment, which indicated that all of the aglb paralogous proteins in these archaeal classes have the kinked helix, with inserted sequences of variable lengths . the insertion sequences allow the spatial arrangement of the three signature residues of the variant type of dk motif to superimpose onto those of the canonical type of dk motif, found in stt <dig> and most aglbs . the finding also supported a previously proposed rule: the catalytic subunits of the ost enzymes in one organism always contain the same type of dk/mi motif, and thus the same type  of ser/thr-binding pocket  <cit> . this information will be useful to understand the distinct and complementary roles of the two to four stt3/aglb paralogs coexisting in one organism.
