BACKGROUND
it has been established that cell-to-cell signaling plays a role in the formation of some biofilms. for example, cell signaling controls the production and secretion of exopolysaccharides for vibrio cholerae biofilms  <cit> . this signaling may be complex as v. harveyi uses three cell-sensing signals including n- homoserine lactone , furanosyl borate diester , and a signal, synthesized by cqsa, whose structure is unknown  <cit> . in addition, the quorum sensing signal n--l-homoserine lactone controls biofilm formation in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , and we have found that in vitro synthesized ai- <dig> stimulates directly escherichia coli biofilm formation  <cit> .

indole is an extracellular signal in e. coli as it has been shown to regulate expression of astd, tnab, and gabt in the stationary phase for planktonic cells  <cit> . indole has also been shown to control multi-drug exporters in e. coli  <cit>  as well as to regulate the pathogenicity island of pathogenic e. coli  <cit>  . recently, indole has been shown to link plasmid multimerization and cell division  <cit> . using dna microarrays, we discovered that genes for the synthesis of indole  were induced by a stationary phase signal  <cit>  and that the gene encoding tryptophanase, tnaa, was repressed 13-fold in 6-day-old e. coli biofilms in complex medium  <cit> . these results implied that indole plays a role in biofilm formation since biofilm cells most closely resemble stationary-phase cells  <cit> . using two e. coli mutants ylih and ycep, we found that indole probably inhibits biofilm formation since these two mutations lead to biofilms with lower intracellular indole concentrations which leads to dramatic increases in biofilm formation and since the addition of extracellular indole reduced biofilm formation for these mutants  <cit> . in contrast, others have reported that indole induces biofilm formation in e. coli as the tnaa deletion decreased biofilm formation and the addition of indole restored it  <cit> . hence, we sought here to explore this contradiction using dna microarrays so that we could study the whole genome as well as use isogenic mutants to test our hypotheses. this approach has led to both the discovery and elucidation of the role of the biofilm regulators mqsr  <cit> , bssr/bsss  <cit> , hha/ybaj  <cit> , and tqsa  <cit> .

the physiological role of sdia has been unclear in e. coli  <cit> . sdia is a luxr homologue that is a quorum-sensing-regulated transcription factor in e. coli  <cit> ; in other bacteria, luxr systems control density-dependent gene regulation through homoserine lactones but e. coli does not have a homoserine lactone synthase  <cit> . in e. coli o157:h <dig>  sdia has been shown to regulate virulence factors  <cit> , and sdia has been shown   <cit>  to inhibit chemotaxis and motility genes in e. coli k- <dig>  to repress tnaa, as well as to induce indole export via acref  <cit> . recently, it has been determined that sdia responds to three different homoserine lactone signals  <cit> , and that sdia controls acid resistance via a synthetic homoserine lactone  <cit> .

to investigate the role of indole in biofilms, the isogenic mutations tnaa , trpe , tnac , and trpl  were used since they control indole synthesis in e. coli  <cit>  . it was found here that homoserine lactone quorum sensing is related to e. coli biofilms via sdia, and that indole is an inter-species biofilm signal that may be manipulated by other bacteria. in addition, the regulation of biofilms via indole is linked to acid resistance via known paths . it was also found that homoserine lactone signals repress e. coli biofilm formation.

RESULTS
the goals of this research were to determine whether indole influences e. coli and pseudomonas sp. biofilm formation  and to determine the genetic basis of this influence through dna microarrays and isogenic mutants. the concentration of indole used here  was not toxic to e. coli since the growth rate at  <dig> μm was reduced only by  <dig> %.

tryptophan mutations and indole concentrations
the trpe, tnac, and tnaa mutations in the tryptophan pathway  reduced by a factor of  <dig> the intracellular indole concentration for e. coli k- <dig> in luria-bertani medium  . the trpl strain had 30% more intracellular indole compared to the wild-type strain  since trpl encodes the attenuator . in addition, extracellular indole concentrations were reduced for the trpe, tnac, and tnaa mutations .

biofilm formation
since we have measured extracellular indole concentrations greater than  <dig> μm with wild-type k <dig>  <cit> , we added  <dig> μm indole to e. coli k- <dig> in lb supplemented with  <dig>  %  glucose  and found it decreases biofilm formation in flow cells . lb glu was chosen since it reduces background indole concentrations  so that exogenous indole would have a greater effect. the addition of indole to the wild-type e. coli changed the biofilm architecture from scattered towers to flatter colonies . comstat analysis  indicated biomass was reduced 40% and substratum coverage was increased  <dig> -fold due to the flat nature of the biofilms with indole.

in  <dig> wells using crystal violet, addition of  <dig> μm indole in lb at 30°c also decreased the  <dig> h biofilm of e. coli atcc <dig> by  <dig> ± 22%, of jm <dig> by  <dig> ± 8%, of tg <dig> by  <dig> ± 13%, and of xl1-blue by  <dig> ± 7%. hence, indole decreased e. coli biofilm formation.

we also explored biofilm formation with several tryptophan pathway mutants using the crystal violet stain method. along with the trpe, tnac, and trpl strains, a strain with the isogenic mutation tnaa was also studied for its effect on biofilm formation because these genes are required for the synthesis of indole  <cit>  . deletion of trpe and tnac  increased biofilm formation in lb glu medium  . as expected, addition of  <dig> and  <dig> μm indole to these two mutants reduced biofilm formation in a dose-dependent response to wild-type levels . these results show reducing intracellular indole concentrations increases biofilm formation in e. coli. they also corroborate our earlier results in which the addition of  <dig> μm indole reduced biofilm formation in the isogenic ycep and ylih mutants in lb and lb glu; these two strains overproduce biofilm as a result of reduced intracellular indole concentrations  <cit> . the deletion of tnaa did not affect biofilm formation in lb glu medium  since tnaa is under catabolite repression.

to verify the 96-well biofilm assay, biofilm formation in lb glu was tested in a continuous flow system for the trpe mutant , and the changes in biofilm were quantified using comstat  <cit> . the trpe mutant displayed similar results in the flow cell as compared to the  <dig> wells as its deletion increased biomass  and thickness  .

dual-species biofilms
toluene o-monooxygenase  of the soil bacterium burkholderia cepacia g <dig> converts indole into isoindigo  <cit> ; hence, we hypothesized that if a bacterium other than e. coli degraded indole and if indole represses e. coli biofilm formation, then e. coli would be present in higher numbers in a biofilm that had another bacterium which expressed tom. tom was integrated into the chromosome of the p. fluorescens strain to diminish the metabolic burden of this locus  <cit>  and because this strain does not produce indole. at day  <dig> in the flow cell with lb medium, the dual species with the pseudomonas expressing tom showed 2- to 5-fold more biofilm of red fluorescent protein  expressing e. coli k- <dig> atcc25404/pgem-t rfp than that in dual species without tom in duplicate experiments . thus, including an organism that actively expressed tom increased the amount of e. coli biofilm.

similarly, when the pseudomonas was tagged with rfp and e. coli with green fluorescent protein  so that both bacteria could be visualized, constitutive expression of tom from the chromosome led to a 12-fold increase in e. coli biofilm after five days in the flow cell . by expressing tom to remove indole, both substratum coverage and mean thickness increased 10-fold; hence, sparse microcolonies became more mature colonies in the absence of the biofilm inhibitor indole. these corroborating sets of dual species biofilm results support our hypothesis that indole decreases biofilm formation with e. coli. since a mixed biofilm formation of two species of pseudomonas and e. coli was clearly observed , this experiment also demonstrates that other bacteria may interfere with indole to control the biofilm formation of e. coli.

to ensure that extracellular indole is present, we ran the flow cell with wild-type k- <dig> alone and found that indole concentrations increase from  <dig> to  <dig> μm in  <dig> to  <dig> h then steadily decrease to  <dig> μm in  <dig> h, so substantial indole is present due to e. coli in our flow cells. then, to show directly that the tom-expressing pseudomonad decreased the indole levels, we measured extracellular indole at  <dig> h in lb medium  for the rfp/gfp dual-culture system with tom vs. no tom and found that the indole concentration was decreased 22-fold . the cell growth rate was  <dig>  ±  <dig> /h for p. fluorescens 2-79/phkt <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig> /h for p. fluorescens 2-79tom/phkt3; hence, the extracellular indole concentrations were decreased by cloning tom, and the changes in e. coli biofilm formation are due to a reduction in extracellular indole concentrations.

indole and pseudomonad biofilms
to determine if indole is a signal for pseudomonads, too, we added indole to p. aeruginosa. indole at  <dig> μm increased biofilm formation  <dig> -fold and  <dig> μm increased biofilm formation  <dig> -fold ; hence, indole, although not synthesized by p. aeruginosa , is a signal that stimulates biofilm in this strain. in addition, removing indole  by expressing tom in p. fluorescens 2– <dig> results in a  <dig> -fold reduction in p. fluorescens biomass compared to p. fluorescens 2– <dig> without tom which indicates that indole stimulates biofilm formation in this pseudomonad .

external indole decreases motility and the deletion of trpe or tnac increases motility
to investigate the cause of the reduction in biofilm due to indole, motility was studied since it positively influences biofilm formation in e. coli  <cit> . the deletion of trpe and tnac increased motility  compared with the isogenic wild-type strain . therefore the reduction in intracellular indole concentration through the deletion of trpe and tnac increases motility which leads to the increased biofilm formation; hence, indole decreases motility. to corroborate that indole decreases motility, the motility of wild-type e. coli and its trpe and tnac mutants were tested upon addition of  <dig> μm indole; the addition of indole decreased motility by  <dig> to 40% for these strains , so the enhanced motility due to a reduction of indole could be diminished by direct addition of indole. hence, indole reduces motility in e. coli, and this reduced motility appears be one of causes of the reduced biofilm formation.

indole is a global regulator in biofilm formation in e. coli through sdia and acid resistance
to investigate the genetic basis of indole regulation of biofilms, we performed three sets of microarray experiments:  direct addition of  <dig> μm indole to k- <dig> ycep in lb glu since this strain has elevated biofilm formation due to low intracellular indole and the biofilm responds to added indole  <cit>  ,  a comparison of k- <dig> trpe vs. k- <dig> wild-type in lb glu since the trpe cells had reduced indole and had elevated biofilm in lb glu at  <dig> h, and  k- <dig> tnaa vs. k- <dig> wild-type in lb since the tnaa cells also had little detectable indole in this medium. glass wool was used to increase the surface area so that rna could be readily obtained for the microarrays. the most significantly induced and repressed genes are shown in table  <dig>  thirteen,  <dig>  and  <dig> genes were differentially induced  and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were differentially repressed  upon indole addition, deleting trpe, or deleting tnaa, respectively.

full data available using geo accession number  <dig>  asterisk indicates p value greater than  <dig>  . negative values indicate repressed genes. b # indicates the blattner number for each gene. boldface indicates most significant fold changes.

notably sdia was one of the most-induced genes  upon addition of  <dig> μm indole . since sdia is predicted to inhibit chemotaxis and motility based on microarrays  <cit> , it was expected that a sdia deletion should lead to enhanced motility and biofilm formation. corroborating our microarray results, the motility of the isogenic sdia strain was increased  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold, and biofilm formation was increased  <dig> ± 2-fold in lb glu at 37°c at  <dig> h  and increased  <dig> -fold in lb at 30°c at  <dig> h. in addition, for short time experiments , the sdia mutation caused a 51-fold increase biofilm formation at 30°c in lb ; however, there was no change in biofilm formation upon deleting sdia at 37°c with lb. hence, sdia represses motility and biofilm formation.

as expected, the addition of  <dig> μm indole to the sdia mutant in lb glu did not appreciably decrease its elevated biofilm levels . hence, indole induces expression of sdia which appears to result in sdia repressing biofilm formation by decreasing motility. similarly, the trpe mutation, which diminishes intracellular indole, led to both increased biofilm  and motility  indicating again that indole is a biofilm inhibitor that controls biofilms by reducing motility. however, the addition of indole also decreased motility of the sdia mutant  so that other factors are involved in the motility reduction with indole. recently, it has been reported that indole is responsible for delaying cell division, and addition of  <dig> mm indole stopped e. coli cell division  <cit> . therefore, we propose that indole may decrease motility through cell division interference.

indole controls sdia-mediated transcription
to corroborate that indole influences sdia and the genes it controls, we tested the ability of indole to alter sdia-influenced transcription of the ftsq2p  promoter; this promoter is one of the few promoters sdia is known to directly induce  <cit> . the addition of  <dig> μm indole to e. coli ut481/pcx <dig> led to a  <dig> ± 15%  decrease in ftsq2p expression which agrees with the 30% reduction seen by garcía-lara et al.  <cit>  due to the unknown stationary-phase factor. therefore, indole affects sdia-mediated transcription. as expected, indole addition to the isogenic sdia mutant  had no effect on ftsq2p expression ; hence, indole either binds sdia directly or through some intermediate and regulates sdia-mediated transcription in the absence of acyl-homoserine lactones.

homoserine lactones and e. coli biofilm formation
since sdia binds four different homoserine lactone signals that e. coli cannot synthesize  <cit> , we tested the ability of homoserine lactone signals to control biofilm formation to cement the link between sdia and biofilms. as with indole, adding three naturally-occurring homoserine lactone signals  inhibited k- <dig> biofilm formation in lb medium in a dose-dependent manner without inhibiting growth by 25%, 27%, and 18%, respectively; however, the isogenic sdia mutant does not respond to the homoserine lactone signals. n--dl-homoserine lactone, n-decanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone, and n-dodecanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone did not change biofilm formation of either the wild type and sdia mutant. these results were repeated  <dig> times for n-butyryl-dl-homoserine lactone and each time there was consistent and significant reduction in e. coli biofilm formation as long as sdia was present. also, the addition of  <dig> μm n-butyryl-dl-homoserine lactone caused a  <dig> ± 7% increase in ftsq2p expression which confirms the homoserine lactone signal binds sdia, while the addition of the  <dig> μm n-butyryl-dl-homoserine lactone to the isogenic sdia mutant had no effect on ftsq2p expression. hence, e. coli responds to homoserine lactone signals by altering its biofilm formation and it does so through sdia.

indole and acid resistance
indole addition also repressed the glutamate decarboxylase acid-resistance genes gadabcex 2- to 4-fold . gadabc are regulated by gade and protect e. coli at ph  <dig> and below which allows the bacterium to colonize the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . also, the other known acid-resistance genes and hdeabd  were repressed 3- to 5-fold by indole . hence, we surmised that indole decreases acid resistance. this hypothesis was tested using lb medium at ph  <dig>  and found that the trpe mutant  was  <dig> times less sensitive to ph  <dig>  than the wild-type, while sdia mutant showed 17-fold less survival . as expected, the positive controls, cells with hdea and gada mutations displayed increased acid sensitivity . to show clearly that indole is directly related to acid resistance, we investigated whether indole addition affects e. coli k- <dig> survival at ph  <dig> . addition of  <dig> mm indole to the wild-type strain decreased survival by  <dig> to 650-fold. however, addition of  <dig> mm indole to the sdia mutant did not appreciably change acid survival . the results also support our hypothesis that indole controls biofilm formation and acid resistance via sdia.

tnaa and trpe microarrays
the deletion of tnaa led to more extensive differential gene expression compared to the deletion of trpe and indole addition to the ycep mutant. as expected, tnac was highly induced  indicating high concentrations of tryptophan arise when tnaa is not active. mtr, which encodes the tryptophan importer  <cit> , was also downregulated, again supporting that tryptophan concentrations were high. the repression of  <dig> phage-related genes  upon deleting tnaa suggests a possible link in biofilm formation and phage-related genes as reported previously in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the repression of seven motility genes in the tnaa mutant  may be the reason the tnaa mutant does not increase biofilm formation despite low intracellular indole . in addition,  <dig> translation and rna genes were induced in the tnaa mutant, and  <dig> translation and rna genes were also induced in the trpe mutant.

to corroborate further the microarray results , two independent cultures of the isogenic e. coli k- <dig> mutants gada and hdea were tested for altered biofilm formation using the 96-well crystal violet assay in lb and lb glu medium. notably, the most significant changes occurred in lb glu medium where there were significant increases in biofilm .

discussion
in this study we demonstrate that both indole and n-acylhomoserine lactones are signals in the formation of e. coli biofilms. indole extracellular concentrations are significant in rich culture broths, and it appears indole negatively regulates e. coli biofilm formation by reducing motility  and by influencing acid resistance. the differences in the architecture upon indole addition  are most likely due to differences in cell motility since we have found differences in e. coli biofilm architecture between strains with different motility phenotypes  <cit> , and the architecture of the strain without indole displayed similarities with high-motility strains while architecture with indole was similar to the architecture for low motility strains. hence, just as one needs an accelerator as well as a brake to control an automobile, it appears e. coli cells control biofilm formation using an inducer  as well as a repressor . in contrast, indole stimulates biofilm formation for p. aeruginosa.

along with stimulating pseudomonad biofilm formation, the two sets of dual-species biofilm results demonstrate that indole is an interspecies signal that can be manipulated by other bacteria . this type of signal manipulation has been shown for ai- <dig> with e. coli and v. harveyi  <cit>  as well as for homoserine lactone with erwinia carotovora and bacillus thuringiensis  <cit> ; hence, competition and control for signals appears to be intense in biofilms. this competition extends beyond procaryotes as eucaryotes are well known for manipulating the quorum sensing signals of bacteria, too. for example, algae block bacterial biofilm formation by controlling both homoserine lactone and ai- <dig> signaling via furanones  <cit> , and mammals  block homoserine lactone signaling via lactonase in sera  <cit> . furthermore, it appears that the mechanism by which procaryotes  manipulate the biofilm signal indole is through the relaxed substrate range of many dioxygenases and monooxygenases found in bacteria that bring about indole hydroxylation  <cit> ; i.e., we propose that some of the oxygenases bacteria use for catabolism  <cit>  have also evolved to regulate concentrations of the inter-species signal indole by removing it via precipitation: competitors that wish to remove indole simply oxidize it in one step to indigo which is insoluble and hence leaves the system.

the results presented here are also important in that they show clearly a connection between homoserine lactone signaling and biofilm formation in e. coli. this implies that e. coli uses the homoserine lactone signaling pathway to monitor at least indole and homoserine lactone compounds  as well as uses the ai- <dig> signaling pathway  <cit>  to control biofilms. hence, although e. coli does not produce its own homoserine lactone via a signal synthase, it uses its homoserine lactone transcriptional regulator  to monitor indole-producing strains as well as to monitor strains like p. aeruginosa , p. syringae , and p. fluorescens . in addition, two groups have found sdia induces the multi-drug efflux pump acrab of e. coli  <cit> , and acrab has been hypothesized to control the efflux of quorum signals  <cit> . given that we demonstrated tqsa of e. coli controls the efflux of the quorum signal ai- <dig>  <cit> , and others demonstrated mexab-oprm of p. aeruginosa controls the efflux of the quorum signal n--l-homoserine lactone  <cit> , it appears indole via its control of sdia, may also control the efflux of quorum signals as well as control antibiotic resistance  <cit> .

it needs to be ascertained whether indole itself binds to sdia which has now been shown to bind four homoserine lactones  <cit> . the induction of sdia upon addition of indole , the decrease in sdia-mediated transcription upon indole addition , the lack of response in biofilm formation upon addition of homoserine lactones by the sdia mutant, the lack of change in acid resistance upon indole addition by the sdia mutant, and the fact that exogenous indole did not reduce the biofilm of the sdia mutant, all suggest indole may bind sdia. furthermore, our results indicate that the extracellular factor first seen by garcía-lara et al.  <cit>  in an ai- <dig> minus background, which was shown to regulate the ftsq2p cell division promoter via sdia and to regulate sdia, is indole. significantly, indole and the ahls have opposing effects on acid resistance and ftsq2p transcription: indole reduced ftsq2p transcription as well as reduced acid resistance but n-butyryl-dl-homoserine lactone increased ftsq2p transcription in this study. furthermore, n-decanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone is known to increase ftsq2p transcription  <cit> , and n-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone enhances acid resistance by inducing gada more than 120-fold  <cit> . hence, these results indicate different roles of indole and ahls on acid-resistance via sdia. also, since indole controls biofilm formation through sdia, these are some of the first results with sdia showing a phenotypic change in e. coli k <dig>  <cit> . since indole and n-butyryl-dl-homoserine lactone showed a marginal effect on plasmid-encoded ftsq2p expression as previously reported  <cit> , measurement of ftsq2p expression from its natural position in the chromosome  <cit>  would be required to corroborate our results.

we also propose that the dna microarray analysis here provides insight into how the bacteria of the gastrointestinal  tract may help to restrict access to pathogens and how it may regulate acid resistance, motility, and biofilm formation of non-pathogenic bacteria. an increase in extracellular indole in the gi tract by non-pathogenic bacteria may repress genes that encode regulators such as gadx  and thereby reduce virulence in the duodenum since gadx activates virulence genes there  <cit> . also, it appears that non-pathogenic e. coli may turn off acid resistance genes  in the presence of indole in the weak basic gut flora since they are no longer needed, so indole serves to regulate acid resistance. also, this increase in indole may serve to regulate motility in a complex manner  and allow cells to form a biofilm. we speculate that the extracellular levels of indole increase only after the non-pathogenic biofilms have reached a certain critical thickness so that indole may decrease motility in the colonizing pathogenic bacteria and allow them to be more effectively removed from the gastrointestinal tract . the pathogen e. coli o157:h <dig> may use indole as a signal since sdia represses expression of the virulence factors espd and intimin  <cit> . in addition, indole from bacteria is absorbed into body  <cit>  so it easy to imagine that cells of the gastrointestinal tract may also manipulate indole levels to control bacteria.

since we found extracellular concentration of indole decreases for k- <dig> cultures from  <dig> ±  <dig> μm to  <dig> ±  <dig> μm upon the addition of glucose to lb medium due to catabolite repression of tnaa  <cit> , some of the results here and in our earlier reports  <cit>  may need to be interpreted in light of changes in indole concentrations. for example, out of  <dig> isogenic knockout mutants identified with temporal biofilm microarrays,  <dig> mutants showed a more distinctive change in biofilm formation relative to the wild-type strain in lb glu medium compared to lb medium  <cit> . here, the k- <dig> trpe, tnac, trpl, gada, and hdea mutants had more significant biofilm changes in lb glu  compared to lb.

it is becoming clear that prokaryotes and eucaryotes signal not only themselves but also one another; for example, there appears to be crosstalk between e. coli o157:h <dig> and cells of the gastrointestinal tract through the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine   <cit> . other hormones are also present in the gastrointestinal tract including melatonin  <cit>  and serotonin  <cit> ; both are neural hormones which maintain homeostasis and both reduce chlamydial infection  <cit> . in addition, plants use indole 3-acetic acid as their main hormone , and bacteria interrupt this eucaryotic signaling by using indole-3-acetic acid as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy  <cit> . all five hormones, such as indole, indole-3-acetic acid, serotonin, melatonin, and epinephrine, have indole-like chemical structures ; hence, although it is highly speculative, it is intriguing to ponder whether indole was incorporated into the metabolism of eucaryotic hosts  and is the archetypal hormone.

CONCLUSIONS
indole is shown to clearly inhibit e. coli biofilm formation and dna microarrays were used to determine that the mechanism of this inhibition is through sdia. indole is an interspecies biofilm signal as it is also shown here that it regulates pseudomonad biofilms, and it is shown that this signal can be manipulated by non-specific oxygenases in a dual-species biofilm to control the population of each bacterium. for the first time, it is also shown that both e. coli and pseudomonads respond to biofilm signals they do not synthesize.
