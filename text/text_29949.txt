BACKGROUND
cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and pectin are among the most abundant carbon reserves on earth, all present in plant biomass. while cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are particularly abundant in grasses and woody plants, pectin is abundant in many fruits and some roots, such as the sugar beet . pectin may be purified and used as a gelling agent and stabilizer, for instance in the food and pharmaceutical industries, or may be hydrolysed to release monomers, primarily d-galacturonic acid, which find limited use as chelating agents. d-galacturonic acid may be electrolytically oxidised to galactaric  acid, avoiding the high concentrations of nitrous oxide which are used to produce galactaric acid from d-galactose or lactose  <cit> . galactaric acid is used in similar applications to d-galacturonic acid, but may also be used in modifying plastics  <cit> . in addition to being oxidised to mucic acid, d-galacturonic acid can also be reduced to l-galactonic acid  <cit> , for applications similar to those with galactaric and d-galacturonic acids. the range of applications for these acids continues to expand.

interest in galactonic acid derivatives has increased on account of the planar zigzag conformation they can adopt in solution , while keto sugars are useful intermediates in the production of various sugar derivatives  <cit> . removal of water from l-galactonic acid leads to the formation of keto-deoxy-l-galactonic acid . keto-deoxy sugars have potential as precursors in the synthesis of medicinal and other compounds  <cit> . keto-deoxy-l-galactonate is an intermediate in the metabolism of d-galacturonate by fungi  <cit>  and the genes encoding d-galacturonate reductase , l-galactonate dehydratase  and 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-galactonate aldolase  have been identified in trichoderma reesei   <cit>  and aspergillus niger  <cit> . deletion of any one of these three genes in t. reesei results in a strain unable to grow on d-galacturonate as sole carbon source. in this paper we describe the conversion of d-galacturonate to 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-galactonate using strains of t. reesei and a. niger from which the 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-galactonate aldolase encoding gene  has been deleted.

RESULTS
bio-conversion of d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate with no added energy source
t. reesei Δlga <dig> converted d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate at an initial rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> h- <dig>  when  <dig>  g d-galacturonate was provided,  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> was produced in the culture supernatant within  <dig> h . however, product was subsequently degraded or removed from the solution through an unknown mechanism. in  <dig>  g d-galacturonate l- <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> was produced  and degradation was not observed. when t. reesei Δlga <dig> was grown in bioreactors, the degradation of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate did not result in increased biomass production or release of measureable amounts of co <dig> 

a. niger Δgaac was incubated in  <dig>  to  <dig>  g d-galacturonate l- <dig> in flasks to assess its ability to convert d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate . a. niger Δgaac produced more keto-deoxy-l-galactonate  at a higher rate  than t. reesei Δlga <dig> . the yield of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate on d-galacturonate was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g g- <dig> in  <dig>  and  <dig> g d-galacturonate l- <dig>  respectively. degradation of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was again observed , with no measureable increase in biomass. in a ph regulated bioreactor  containing ~ <dig> g biomass l- <dig> in  <dig> g d-galacturonate l- <dig> solution  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was produced. the initial production rate was  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> h- <dig>  and the yield ~ <dig> g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate - <dig> 

the ph of the supernatant increased to between  <dig>  and  <dig>  when t. reesei Δlga <dig> and a. niger Δgaac were incubated in unbuffered d-galacturonate solutions in flasks. viable hyphae were still present during incubation in d-galacturonate solutions and t. reesei Δlga <dig> showed normal sporulation. the vital stain methylene blue was used for a qualitative assessment of cell vitality. considerable staining and cell shearing were observed in both control and keto-deoxy-l-galactonate producing strains incubated in the same conditions.

the effect of added d-xylose on the bio-conversion of d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate
conversion of d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate is an nadph-requiring process. although pre-grown mycelium has some nadph, conversion of d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate could be more efficient if a co-substrate was provided as an energy source to replenish nadph. addition of  <dig> to  <dig> g d-xylose l- <dig>  improved  the initial rate of conversion of d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate by t. reesei Δlga <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> h- <dig>  the highest concentrations of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate from d-galacturonate were observed with  <dig> or  <dig> g d-xylose l- <dig>  with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> being produced in medium containing  <dig> g d-galacturonate l- <dig> and  <dig> g d-xylose l- <dig>  at a yield of  <dig>  g - <dig> . with these concentrations of d-xylose, the specific production rate was similar to that in d-galacturonate solution without d-xylose , but with higher concentrations of d-xylose  specific production was reduced to ~ <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate - <dig> h- <dig>  higher specific production rates were observed in ph-controlled bioreactor cultures  than in flask cultures.

incubation of a. niger Δgaac in medium containing  <dig>  g d-galacturonate l- <dig> and  <dig> g d-xylose l- <dig> resulted in the production of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> at a rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig>  and a yield of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g - <dig>  the ph after  <dig> h incubation had decreased to  <dig> .

d-galacturonate was taken up at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g d-galacturonate l- <dig> h- <dig>  by t. reesei Δlga <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g d-galacturonate l- <dig> h- <dig>  by a. niger Δgaac in flask cultures at low biomass concentrations, with or without added xylose. higher volumetric uptake rates , but lower specific uptake rates , were observed for both strains with higher biomass concentrations. in bioreactor cultures d-galacturonate uptake rates were lower than in flasks and similar  for the two strains.

intracellular concentrations of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate
keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was detected intracellularly within  <dig> h  incubation in medium containing  <dig>  g d-galacturonate l- <dig> and  <dig>  g d-xylose l- <dig> in t. reesei Δlga <dig>  and within  <dig> h  incubation in  <dig> g d-galacturonate l- <dig> in a. niger Δgaac , when extracellular keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was only  <dig>  to  <dig>  g l- <dig> . in t. reesei, the intracellular keto-deoxy-l-galactonate concentration increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> and then decreased at an almost linear rate  as the extracellular concentration increased. in a. niger a maximum intracellular keto-deoxy-l-galactonate concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> was observed after  <dig> h incubation, but the intracellular concentration was approximately constant  from  <dig> to  <dig> h , as extracellular concentrations increased. biomass concentration decreased in both a. niger and t. reesei cultures at similar rates, reflecting attachment of biomass to surfaces in the bioreactor and/or cell lysis. cell lysis, however, would have contributed at most  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> to the supernatant of the t. reesei culture and less than  <dig>  g l- <dig> to the supernatant of the a. niger culture.

conversion of polygalacturonate and pectin to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate
a. niger Δgaac produced keto-deoxy-l-galactonate directly from polygalacturonate and from pectin .  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> was produced from  <dig> g pectin l- <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> from  <dig> g polygalacturonate l- <dig> , at rates of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig>  respectively. maximum intracellular keto-deoxy-l-galactonate  was observed at  <dig> h in both pectin and polygalacturonate. degradation of extracellular keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was observed at the end of the cultivations.

hydrolysis of polygalacturonate was rapid, with  <dig>  g d-galacturonate l- <dig> present in the supernatant after only  <dig> h and increasing to  <dig>  g d-galacturonate l- <dig> at  <dig> h, after which concentrations decreased. d-galacturonate did not accumulate intracellularly, or was present in very low amounts. d-galacturonate  was not observed in the culture supernatant of the pectin cultures until  <dig> h, when  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> had already been produced. after  <dig> h the concentration of d-galacturonate in the supernatant decreased. intracellular d-galacturonate was observed in these cultures  and was detectable after only  <dig> h.

in addition to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate, approximately  <dig> g biomass l- <dig> was produced in  <dig> g pectin l- <dig> and  <dig> g biomass l- <dig> in  <dig> g polygalacturonate l- <dig>  of which 1- <dig>  g biomass l- <dig> would have been derived from the 2- <dig> g d-xylose l- <dig> provided to the cultures and the rest from the carbohydrates present in the pectin or polygalacturonate. growth resulted in a decrease in ph in both media, to  <dig>  in polygalacturonate and  <dig>  in pectin.

in contrast, t. reesei Δlga <dig> did not produce keto-deoxy-l-galactonate when incubated in  <dig> g pectin l- <dig> and  <dig>  g d-xylose l- <dig>  d-xylose was consumed and ~ <dig>  g biomass l- <dig> was produced, but no d-galacturonate was detected in the culture supernatant.

discussion
hilditch et al.  <cit>  observed the conversion of d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate when conidia of t. reesei Δlga <dig> were incubated in medium containing  <dig>  g peptone l- <dig> and  <dig> g d-galacturonate l- <dig>  the peptone allowed conidial germination, resulting in  <dig>  g biomass l- <dig> and keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was produced extracellularly at a rate of approximately  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig>  here we demonstrate that the conversion rate is substantially increased to  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig> when cultures are inoculated with more biomass and that the rate can be further increased  by including a carbon/energy source  in the medium. keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was produced after d-xylose had been consumed and high concentrations of d-xylose limited production.

a. niger Δgaac was more efficient than t. reesei Δlga <dig> at producing keto-deoxy-l-galactonate, with production rates of  <dig>  to  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig>  in solutions without and with added d-xylose, respectively. a. niger Δgaac also produced keto-deoxy-l-galactonate directly from citrus peel pectin or polygalacturonate at similar or higher  rates. these rates were comparable or higher to those demonstrated for the production of 2-keto-d-galactonate from d-galactose  by pseudomonas fluorescens  <cit>  and considerably higher than those observed for 2-keto-l-galactonate production by erwinia herbicola , although their function has not been confirmed. t. reesei appears to have a capacity, similar to or only slightly lower than that of a. niger, to take up d-galacturonate, but this capacity is not always realised, as also observed during galactarate production  <cit> .

measurement of intracellular keto-deoxy-l-galactonate concentrations in both t. reesei and a. niger demonstrated that it accumulated inside the cells to approximately  <dig> to  <dig> g l- <dig>  and was detectable intracellularly before being detectable in the supernatant, suggesting that export of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate at ph  <dig>  may be limited. in contrast, citrate is reported to accumulate intracellularly to only  <dig>  to  <dig> g citrate l- <dig> in a. niger when producing citrate  <cit> . none-the-less, intracellular accumulation of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate to  <dig> -  <dig> g l- <dig> did not appear to strongly affect hyphal viability or ability of t. reesei to sporulate. in a. niger,  <dig> g intracellular keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> appeared to be a threshold above which all keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was exported to the supernatant . in t. reesei, the intracellular concentration decreased as extracellular concentrations increased , suggesting that t. reesei was able to induce an efficient export system, or that cell lysis contributed to its release into the supernatant. release of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate from the cytoplasm would have contributed less than  <dig>  g keto-deoxy-l-galactonate l- <dig> in the supernatant and the continued uptake and conversion of d-galacturonate demonstrated that cell lysis alone was not responsible for the export in t. reesei. export of organic acids by fungi is not well understood, but often involves active transport, as in citrate export by a. niger  <cit>  or sorbate export by s. cerevisiae  <cit> . if export of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate requires active transport, the separation of growth and production phases would be undesirable and a substrate limited fed-batch process may enable higher over-all production rates. transporters specific for keto-deoxy-l-galactonate would not be expected in either a. niger or t. reesei, which would not normally accumulate keto-deoxy-l-galactonate intracellularly, however other transporters might be expected to have various levels of affinity to transport keto-deoxy-l-galactonate in addition to their target molecules.

the theoretical yield of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate from d-galacturonate is  <dig>  g g- <dig> . t. reesei Δlga <dig> converted d-galacturonate to keto-deoxy-l-galactonate with an average yield of  <dig>  g g- <dig> in flask cultures and up to  <dig>  g g- <dig> in ph controlled bioreactor cultures, although the yield tended to decrease as the cultures progressed. d-galacturonate did not accumulate in the cytoplasm in t. reesei, so uptake and storage of d-galacturonate was not responsible for the low yield. keto-deoxy-l-galactonate concentrations decreased in some cultures, indicating that it could be degraded into non-metabolisable products or complex with other organic molecules.

the yield of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate from d-galacturonate was higher with a. niger Δgaac  than with t. reesei Δlga <dig>  the theoretical yield being achieved in pure d-galacturonate solution and from polygalacturonate. values above  <dig>  g g- <dig> reflect the difficulty of measuring d-galacturonate accurately when keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was present. keto-deoxy-l-galactonate degradation was also observed in a. niger Δgaac cultures. futile metabolism of d-galacturonate has previously been observed in t. reesei Δgar <dig> and a. niger Δgaaa strains, with or without co-expression of a uronate dehydrogenase  <cit> .

a. niger Δgaac produced more keto-deoxy-l-galactonate than t. reesei Δlga <dig>  at higher rates. the a. niger strain chosen as producer  is a known citric acid producer and is more acid tolerant than t. reesei. both low ph tolerance and high citrate production suggest that a. niger atcc <dig> has more efficient acid export than t. reesei, which could contribute to improved production. however, differences in the d-galacturonate reductases  and l-galactonate dehydratases  may also contribute to the higher production in a. niger, as would differences in d-galacturonate uptake in some conditions. further, a. niger produced sufficient pectinases to produce keto-deoxy-l-galactonate directly from pectin or polygalacturonate, whereas t. reesei did not, as expected given the limited pectinase encoding genes in its genome  <cit> . simultaneous hydrolysis and bioconversion is thus feasible with a. niger Δgaac, and the non-galacturonate sugars in pectin could provide the co-substrate for biomass and energy production.

CONCLUSIONS
a. niger Δgaac and t. reesei Δlga <dig> convert d-galacturonate to 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-galactonate, which accumulates extracellularly. production rates were comparable or better than those observed for similar products with bacterial cells  <cit>  and could be further improved by optimising the provision of co-substrate for biomass and energy production. total production, volumetric production rate and specific production rate were higher for a. niger Δgaac than t. reesei Δlga <dig> and the ability of a. niger Δgaac to produce keto-deoxy-l-galactonate directly from pectin or polygalacturonate demonstrate that it is the more desirable production organism.

although keto-deoxy-l-galactonate accumulated intracellularly, concentrations above ~ <dig> g l- <dig> were exported to the culture supernatant. lysis may have contributed to the release of keto-deoxy-l-galactonate from t. reesei mycelia. since keto-deoxy-l-galactonate was not stable in the culture supernatant, it would be necessary to closely monitor a production process to obtain maximum yields and it would be advantageous to determine the path by which the keto-deoxy-l-galactonate is destroyed.
