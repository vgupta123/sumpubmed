BACKGROUND
a major challenge of white  biotechnology is the production with high yield of reduced carbon chains able to replace fossil hydrocarbons. two examples of well-established processes able to produce high volumes of useful carbon chains are ethanol fermentation by yeast and lactate fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. ethanol is used mainly as a biofuel and more recently as a substrate in polyethylene production
 <cit> . lactic acid is used mainly in the food industry, but is currently employed as the building block for the biodegradable plastic polylactic acid 
 <cit> .

though economically viable, both processes have weaknesses. ethanol production has a low carbon recovery  due to the decarboxylation of pyruvate being a mandatory step for ethanol formation. carbon recovery in lactate fermentation is much higher ; however lactic acid has a high oxygen content, which makes its conversion into other industrially relevant 3-carbon molecules difficult. for that reason, it is important to search for new fermenting organisms capable of producing reduced carbon chains with higher efficiency in carbon recovery.

in this context, propionibacterium acidipropionici is a good candidate to be developed for biotechnological processes . p. acidipropionici has been widely studied for the heterofermentative production of propionic acid, including fermentation on a semi-industrial scale 
 <cit> . propionic acid is more reduced than lactic acid and can be produced with higher yields than ethanol in yeast: a yield of  <dig>  g/g of propionic acid was obtained from glucose
 <cit> ,  <dig>  g/g from glycerol and  <dig>  g/g from molasses
 <cit> . propionic acid and its salts are valuable industrial products with several applications such as mold-inhibitors, preservatives for animal and human food, fruit flavorings, essence base, additives in cellulosic plastics, herbicides and medications for animal therapy
 <cit> . annual world consumption of propionic acid was estimated at  <dig>  thousand tonnes in  <dig>  representing a market of approximately  <dig> million dollars with an expected growth rate of  <dig> % until 2014
 <cit> .

propionibacterium are classified under the high gc division  of bacteria and are overall characterized as gram-positive, rod-like, pleomorphic, non-spore-forming, non-motile and facultative anaerobic or aerotolerant bacteria. these bacteria are further classified into two groups: cutaneous, found on different areas of human skin; and dairy, isolated mainly from cheese and milk. p. acidipropionici is classified in the dairy group. although differentiated by their typical natural habitats, all species of propionibacterium produce propionic acid as the major fermentative product, with acetic acid and carbon dioxide as the main subproducts
 <cit> .

it is noteworthy that even after 100 years of accumulated research on propionibacteria, propionic acid is still produced via petrochemical routes and no industrial biotechnology process for these organisms has been established. the main hindrances have been low productivity, low final product concentration, slow growth, high end-product inhibition, and costly downstream separation from sub products
 <cit> . to improve propionic acid fermentation by p. acidipropionici it is necessary to obtain more detailed information about the organism’s basic biology, especially its molecular biology with only a few studies focusing on the genetics of p. acidipropionici <cit> .

consequently, in this work the molecular biology of p. acidipropionici was investigated mainly through genome sequencing and its comparative analysis with three close related and fully sequenced bacteria species. experimental confirmation of key pathways were performed by a preliminary proteome analysis, fermentation tests with and without 2-deoxy-d-glucose and/or c <dig> flux analysis of c13o <dig> supplemented fermentation. we identified physiological and metabolic traits that characterize p. acidipropionici as a bioreactor for the production of c <dig> compounds and discuss the possibility of genetically modifying this species to convert propionic acid into more valuable products such as propionaldehyde, n-propanol, acrylic acid and propylene.

RESULTS
general genome features
the genome of p. acidipropionici comprises a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  with  <dig> % gc content and a low-copy plasmid of  <dig>  bp with  <dig> % gc content. the chromosome contains  <dig>  protein coding sequences  with an average length of  <dig>  bp,  <dig> trnas and four 16s-23s-5s rrna operons, accounting for  <dig> % of genomic dna. putative functions were assigned to  <dig>   of the cdss, while  <dig>  were classified as conserved hypothetical and  <dig>  had no significant similarity with data in the public databases  .

preliminary proteomic analysis of p. acidipropionici growing on different carbon sources allowed the identification of  <dig>  of the cdss . the assembled plasmid matched exactly the previously sequenced prgo1
 <cit>  from p. acidipropionici and plme <dig> from p. jensenii <cit> . the number of plasmid copies per cell was estimated to be  <dig>  based upon relative read coverage. we identified one new cds  in the plasmid coding for an  <dig> amino acid peptide similar to an interpro family of proteins putatively involved in plasmid stabilization . this peptide sequence may be useful for the development of p. acidipropionici vectors, a fundamental molecular biology tool for the biotechnological use of any organism.

comparative analysis
the genome of p. acidipropionici, a species that can live in several environments such as soil, rumen and cheese, was compared with the genomes of three closely related species, but with different habitats and ecology:  p. acnes , a major inhabitant of human skin and considered to be an opportunistic pathogen that has been associated with acne vulgaris
 <cit> ;  p. freudenreichii subs. shermanii cirm-bia1t  which has known use in cheese manufacture and, more recently, as a probiotic
 <cit> ; and  microlunatus phosphovorus , a species that belongs to the same family , which is found in soil and has been isolated from activated sludge by its ability to accumulate polyphosphate and polyhydroxyalkanoates 
 <cit> . the general features of these genomes are summarized in table 
 <dig> 

clustering of all proteins encoded by these four bacteria resulted in  <dig> families. from the total proteins encoded by p. acidipropionici,  <dig> were clustered into  <dig> families containing  <dig> to  <dig> members. the comparative clustering of proteins from p. acidipropionici, p. acnes and p. freudenreichii is summarized in figure
2a, and a four-set venn diagram including m. phosphovorus is presented in an additional figure . p. acidipropionici shows great expansion in families shared by the three propionibacteria, most notably in transport proteins, two-component regulatory systems, transcriptional regulators and proteins with oxidoreductase activity . families of transport proteins were compared in detail using the transporter classification  system. a total of  <dig> transport proteins were annotated in p. acidipropionici genome and almost half  of these proteins were classified as members of the atp-binding cassette family . this proportion is greater than in any of the other three bacteria species used in the comparison . the complete comparison of transport proteins in these four bacteria species is presented in an additional file .

the assignment of gene ontology terms to proteins unique to p. acidipropionici is depicted in figures
2b and
2c. two proteins that distinguish the central fermentative pathway of p. acidipropionici from that of p. acnes and p. freudenreichii have ligase activity and are discussed in the section “propionic acid fermentation”. proteins with sequence-specific dna binding and methyltransferase activities could be involved in dna repair, gene expression and chromosome replication. these proteins could also compose a restriction modification system serving as defense against foreign dna. therefore, the study of these proteins that are unique to p. acidipropionici may be important in developing genetic tools suitable for this strain.

the number of common genes is consistent with the previously reported phylogeny
 <cit> . p. acidipropionici is more closely related to p. acnes and colinearity of genes was observed most of the time . however, p. acnes has approximately  <dig>  genes fewer than p. acidipropionici, a fact that could reflect the specialization of this species as an opportunistic pathogen of human skin. it is generally considered that specialization leads to gene loss
 <cit> , a process that can be very fast in bacteria. for example, in lactobacillus the transition of strains to nutritionally rich environments leads to metabolic simplification and the loss of several genes
 <cit> . although p. freudenreichii has all the enzymes needed for the de novo biosynthesis of amino acids and vitamins
 <cit> , the metabolic simplification premise may indicate that the reduced number of genes found in p. freudenreichii in comparison to p. acidipropionici is suggestive of the beginning of a specialization process as a consequence of the continuous use of this species in cheese ripening. this reasoning is consistent with the analysis of the m. phosphovorus genome, a soil bacterium, with  <dig>  annotated genes. most of the gene clusters that were conserved in the three propionibacterium are also present in m. phosphovorus  . p. acidipropionici, with  <dig>  genes, would seem to hold an intermediary position. the  <dig> pseudogenes identified in p. acidipropionici are disrupted by a single frameshift or point mutation, suggesting that these events are recent and that some genome reduction is underway.

the horizontal transfer of dna fragments might supply the recipient microorganism with the necessary genetic resources to be able to adapt to new environments; for example, an antibiotic resistance gene and/or a gene that encodes a peptide in a biodegradative pathway
 <cit> . furthermore, jain et al. <cit>  described the horizontal transfer of genes as a mechanism to spread genetic diversity across species and showed that horizontal gene transfer occurs between organisms that share similar factors like g/c content, genome size, oxygen tolerance and carbon utilization. predicted genomics islands account for  <dig> %  of total p. acidipropionici genes. this number is similar to predictions in p. acnes and m. phosphovorus genomes  but lower than the prediction in the p. freudenreichii genome .

defense of genome integrity
analysis of the p. acidipropionici genome revealed some defense mechanisms that may allow it to withstand viral and nucleic acid invasion; these include restriction enzymes and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats . crisprs can provide the cell with an acquired resistance against bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids, possibly acting as a rna interference-like mechanism. the spacers between direct repeats are derived from invader sequences and determine the specificity of the system. in addition, the mechanism is composed by crispr-related sequences , which are proteins encoded in the vicinity of crispr loci
 <cit> . some of these proteins show similarity to helicases and repair proteins. seven crispr-associated proteins were annotated in the p. acidipropionici genome , while only two were identified in the p. freudenreichii and m. phosphovorus genomes. moreover, using the crispr finder tool , three crispr loci were annotated in p. acidipropionici genome. the crispr <dig> locus contains 1248 bp and harbors  <dig> spacer sequences, the crispr <dig> locus contains 2043 bp and harbors  <dig> spacer sequences and the crispr <dig> locus contains 3689 bp and harbors  <dig> spacer sequences. the length of direct repeat sequence in all crispr loci is 29 bp. the spacers do not show strong similarity to phage and bacteria sequences available in databases from the national center for biotechnology information . since cas genes and crisprs are known to have undergone extensive horizontal transfer and the identified proteins do not share high sequence similarity , these regions could have been acquired horizontally from different sources, explaining this inequality. no crispr-related proteins were found in the p. acnes genome.

the most common cause of slow or incomplete bacterial fermentations in the dairy industry is bacteriophage infections that lead to substantial economic loss
 <cit> . to deal with phage diversity, lactic acid bacteria have developed several systems to withstand the infections; one of these is the crispr/cas system. crispr/cas loci have been identified in many lactic acid bacteria, such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus rhamnosus <cit> . the crispr/cas system was found in the genome of p. acidipropionici, and could thus be interpreted as another feature of this bacterium that could render it robustness against phage infections in an industrial setting for the production of chemical commodities. furthermore, the genomic data for the crispr/cas system found in p. acidipropionici will provide information about the defense mechanism of this bacterium and allow the development of studies to improve its resistance to phage infections.

lifestyle and environmental adaptation
many of the annotated proteins families in p. acidipropionici have the potential to render this species flexibility to adapt to different environments . among these protein families are the carbohydrate abc transporters, transcriptional regulators, two-component response regulators, and oxidoreductases; all of these families had greater numbers of members in p. acidipropionici when compared with p.acnes or p. freudenreichii. moreover, there are more rrna operons and trna genes in p. acidipropionici compared with the other three species . this feature could potentially confer competitive advantages such as a faster growth rate and quick response to environmental changes
 <cit> . m. phosphovorus contains the same set of  <dig> trnas as p. acnes and p. freudenreichii, plus a selenocysteine trna that could be present solely to support formate dehydrogenase expression and is unique to m. phosphovorus among the four species that were compared.

other protein families that appear expanded in p. acidipropionici in comparison to the other three species are glutathione-s-transferases  and hnh endonucleases. compared with the single copy of a glutathione s-transferases  coding gene found in p. freudenreichii genome, three copies of the gene were found in the p. acidipropionici genome . in bacteria, this enzyme has been reported to be involved on growth on recalcitrant chemicals and in the degradation of aromatic compounds
 <cit> . hnh endonucleases coding genes were absent from the genome of p. freudenreichii, p. acnes e m. phosphovorus, while eight copies grouped into two clusters were found in p. acidipropionici . this enzyme is a type of homing endonuclease that could be potentially involved in dna rearrangements or could act as bacteriocin
 <cit> . taken together, the notable expansion of these two gene families may confer to p. acidipropionici robustness in its capacity for growth under adverse conditions and competitiveness against other bacterial species. however, further studies are needed to establish the function of these enzymes in the lifestyle of p. acidipropionici.

on the other hand, previously reported probiotic related genes were found only in the p. freudenreichii genome 
 <cit> , thus agreeing with the possible adaptation of the species to the nutritional environment of the gut. similarly, some protein families that were identified only in p. acnes are probably related to pathogenicity and host specialization. some examples of these families include camp factor, endoglycoceramidases, sialic acid transporter, sialidases, and lysophospholipase.

energy reserve and stress resistance
polyphosphates  are linear polymers composed of orthophosphate residues. polyps are not only used as energy reserves, but also have been related to stress resistance and adaptation to extreme environments
 <cit> . p. freudenreichii st <dig> has been reported to accumulate up to 3% of cell dry weight of polyp
 <cit>  and m. phosphovorus nm- <dig> has been reported to accumulate up to  <dig> %
 <cit> . falentin et al. <cit>  identified the genes related to polyphosphate metabolism in p. freudenreichii cirm-bia1; all of these genes were present in the four genomes that were compared in the present study. similar numbers of the nudix hydrolases were present in all four organisms, suggesting that they had similar levels of metabolic complexity and adaptability
 <cit> . in addition to the one copy of polyphosphate kinase  per genome that we found, ppk <dig> genes were also identified in the four genomes. ppk is an important enzyme in bacterial polyp synthesis, transferring reversibly the terminal phosphate of atp to polyp. ppk <dig> differs from ppk by its use of either gtp or atp, its preference for mn2+ over mg2+ and for being stimulated by polyp
 <cit> . p. acidipropionici , p. acnes  and p. freudenreichii  have one ppk <dig> copy each. m. phosphovorus contains three ppk <dig> copies , which may play an important role in the large polyp accumulation in this organism.

metabolic reconstruction
the predicted metabolic map of p. acidipropionici contained  <dig> pathways and  <dig>  enzymatic reactions. the gene annotations and metabolic maps revealed that the complete pathways of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pentose-phosphate and all de novo amino acid biosynthesis were represented in the p. acidipropionici genome. the tca cycle was also complete and genes corresponding to aerobic and anaerobic respiration pathways were detected. the biosynthetic pathways for most vitamins were found; however, pathways for biotin and pantothenic acid synthesis were notably absent, as has been reported for other species from this genus
 <cit> . figure
 <dig> summarizes the basic metabolic pathways that were present in p. acidipropionici.

substrate utilization
it has been reported that p. acidipropionici can use a wide variety of substrates for the heterofermentative production of propionic acid
 <cit> . in agreement with this report, the genome analysis of p. acidipropionici has revealed a notable set of transporters  and enzymes that could be related to uptake and degradation of numerous substrates, putatively including glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, xylose, threalose, mannose, chitobiose and arabinose. the genome comparison showed that two families within abc superfamily concerned exclusively with carbohydrate uptake are present in greater number in the genome of p. acidipropionici. the carbohydrate uptake transporter- <dig>  and − <dig>  families exhibit specificity for oligosaccharides and monosaccharides, respectively. there are two principal amino acid uptake families in the abc superfamily. the family specific for polar amino acids uptake  is more numerous in the p. acidipropionici genome. the family concerned with hydrophobic amino acids uptake  had the same number of genes identified in all bacteria compared, except in p. acnes, where no members were identified
 <cit> . the propanediol utilization operon of p. freudenreichii, probably acquired through horizontal transfer
 <cit> , is not present in p. acidipropionici, p. acnes or m. phosphovorus.

p. acidipropionici possesses one invertase coding gene  and could thus potentially use sucrose as a carbon source, while m. phosphovorus has two copies of putative invertase coding genes . p. acnes and p. freudenreichii lack such a gene, and for that reason, the growth of these species in sucrose containing feedstocks like molasses needs pretreatment, with consequent cost increase
 <cit> . this feature enables the development of p. acidipropionici fermentations at low cost from renewable feedstocks, such as sugarcane juice readily available in brazil. experimental batch fermentations using p. acidipropionici with sugarcane juice showed a significant yield and productivity of propionic acid, although significant amounts of acetic and succinic acids still emerged as by-products . in addition, the ability of this bacterium to metabolize the c <dig> sugar xylose has also been previously reported
 <cit> , which makes this species a strong candidate for the metabolization of second generation feedstocks derived from biomass. industrial ethanol fermentations are commonly contaminated by indigenous yeasts, which many times are less productive than the commercial yeasts used in ethanol fermentation. this causes considerable yield losses and in some cases indigenous yeasts are even able to replace commercial yeasts
 <cit> . preliminary experiments showed that the production of propionic acid inhibited the growth of indigenous yeasts in sugarcane juice . hence, industrial fermentation to produce propionic acid with p. acidipropionici using sugarcane juice could be performed without strict microbial control, potentially reducing production costs.

in summary, we report here the genetic basis for the ability of p. acidipropionici to metabolize many carbon sources, confirming previous studies of carbon source utilization by this species. these carbon sources include the readily available sucrose from sugar cane juice
 <cit>  and the c <dig> sugar xylose that is abundant in second generation feedstocks derived from biomass
 <cit> . these results coupled to the preliminary findings suggesting that the propionic acid produced by propionibacteria may help control possible contamination by indiginous yeast species in an industrial setting emphasizes the potential of p. acidipropionici as a biological reactor of industrial interest.

catabolic repression and phosphotransferase system
given the wide range of substrates that p. acidipropionici is able to metabolize, we performed a preliminary study to verify the presence of carbon catabolite repression. p. acidipropionici was grown in various carbon sources  with or without addition of the hexose analogous 2-deoxy-glucose . 2-deoxyglucose is taken up by cell and phosphorylated into 2-dg 6-phosphate. this molecule cannot be metabolized; however it is able to trigger the glucose repression phenomenon
 <cit> . therefore, the presence of 2-dg in the cultures led to a clear decrease in the p. acidipropionici growth rate, suggesting the presence of a possible mechanism of carbon catabolite repression by glucose . the analysis of variance test  indicated that there was a significant difference between the growth rate of p. acidipropionici grown in the media containing glucose and in the media containing glucose with 2-dg ; fructose and fructose with 2-dg ; sucrose and sucrose with 2-dg ; lactate and lactate with 2-dg  and glycerol and glycerol with 2-dg .

the molecular basis of this phenomenon is generally related to a multiprotein phosphorelay system, the phosphotransferase system . at least three enzymes, enzyme i , histidine protein  and enzyme ii , that are responsible for carbohydrate transporting, phosphorylation and triggering the catabolic repression respectively, are present in the pts
 <cit> . twenty-three genes coding for general proteins of the pts were identified in the p. acidipropionici genome . moreover, two transcriptional factors probably involved in this system  and  <dig> pts-regulatory domains , which could act as antitermination proteins or as transcriptional activators, were found in the genome of p. acidipropionici. in addition, carbon catabolite repression can regulate the expression of virulence factors in many pathogenic bacteria
 <cit> , and this could explain the great number of pts related genes  found in the p. acnes genome. on the other hand, p. freudenreichii has only  <dig> genes related to the pts. these observations could suggest that p. acidipropionici has the potential ability for selective carbon source utilization and genome plasticity to adapt to different environments, but further studies would be necessary in order to confirm this hypothesis.

aerobic metabolism
p. acidipropionici is a facultative anaerobic microorganism. in practical terms, the cells need anaerobic conditions to grow on solid media; however, they can grow in liquid media with oxygen added 
 <cit> . inspection of its genome showed that all the genes related to aerobic respiration and oxidative stress are present. p. acidipropionici had two putative catalase genes while p. acnes and p. freudenreichii contained only one copy. thus, the susceptibility of p. acidipropionici to oxygen could be related to deficient expression of the oxidative defense genes or to a redox imbalance. these preliminary data are encouraging in suggesting oxygen resistance in this species. however, further studies on the oxygen resistance of p. acidipropionici will be needed in order to establish non-strict anaerobic conditions for growth in an industrial setting, where the maintenance of a strict anaerobic atmosphere would be too costly.

electron transport chain
the electron transport chains of prokaryotes vary widely, having multiple terminal oxidases. this variation allows bacteria to adapt their respiratory systems to different environmental growth conditions
 <cit>  by choosing the composition of enzymes that will achieve:  the highest possible coupling efficiency ;  the rapid removal of excess reducing equivalents such as nadh/nadph; and  the regulation of intracellular oxygen concentration
 <cit> .

cytochrome bd  is present in all four organisms that were compared. in e. coli, this oxidase has a high affinity for oxygen but it does not pump protons being preferred in low-oxygen conditions because the respiratory chain is then still able to provide energy, even in low amounts
 <cit> . although the cytochrome bd complex does not pump protons in e.coli, there is a net proton transfer  by this oxidase due to quinol oxidation and oxygen reduction on the periplasmic and the cytoplasmic sides of membrane, respectively
 <cit> .

on the other hand, cytochrome c oxidase  reduces molecular oxygen to water coupled with the pumping of four protons across the membrane, generating more energy
 <cit> . the four subunits of cco , the cytochrome c reductase  and cytochrome c biogenesis and assembly proteins were found in p. acidipropionici, p. acnes and m. phosphovorus, suggesting a greater flexibility of these strains to adapt to different oxygen conditions in comparison to p. freudenreichii, which lacks these genes. however, p. acidipropionici showed a frameshift in cco subunit i . because the cco subunit i is a strongly conserved protein and the p. acidipropionici version have lost most of its domain identity and its copper-binding site, this oxidase is probably not functional. the alignment of the  <dig> and illumina reads against the frameshift region can be viewed in the additional figure s <dig> .

a recent transcriptome work using p. acnes <cit>  detected expression of the whole respiratory chain under anaerobic growth conditions, including nadh dehydrogenase/complex i  and succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase . wackwitz and colleagues
 <cit>  showed that ndh- <dig> is stimulated under fumarate-dependent respiration in e. coli. brzuszkiewicz and colleagues
 <cit>  hypothesized a scenario of p. acnes metabolism with atp generation via fof <dig> atp synthase and proton translocation by ndh- <dig> and sdhabc, with the former feeding reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain, and the latter using fumarate as terminal electron acceptor. these proteins were also detected in our proteome analysis of anaerobic fermentation samples, indicating a similar behavior in p. acidipropionici, capable to use different electron acceptors . p. acidipropionici has two sdhabc/frdabc gene clusters, sdhabc  and sdha2b2c <dig> . only sdhabc was detected in the anaerobic fermentation samples and hence could be acting as fumarate reductase, while sdha2b2c <dig> could be used in the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. the membrane anchor subunits sdhc and sdhc <dig> have five transmembrane helices each and predicted molecular weight of  <dig> and 28 kda respectively, characteristic for sdh/frd proteins lacking subunit d. when the cluster contains a sdhd/frdd subunit, the sdhc/frdc proteins are distinctly smaller  and contain only three transmembrane helices each
 <cit> . given its importance in propionibacteria metabolism, a better understanding of electron transport chain can help design engineered strains with fine-tuned redox balance.

nitrate and sulfate reduction
kaspar 
 <cit>  demonstrated that strains of p. acidipropionici, p. freudenreichii, p. jensenii, p. shermanii and p. thoenii can reduce nitrate to nitrite and further to nitrous oxide. this ability was later shown to vary from strain to strain, being strongly affected by environmental factors
 <cit> . p. acidipropionici atcc  <dig> seems to be able to use nitrate as an electron acceptor, since all the genes of the respiratory nitrate reduction to nitrous oxide were all found: respiratory nitrate reductase , nitrite reductase   and nitric-oxide reductase  . these genes are also present in p. acnes and m. phosphovorus, while p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii cannot reduce nitrate due to lack of a functional nitrate reductase
 <cit> . also, p. acidipropionici could reduce the nitrite to ammonium through the enzyme nitrite/sulfite reductase  and incorporate the ammonium formed into amino acids. this gene is also present in p. freudenreichii and m. phosphovorus, but not in p. acnes. additionally, genes coding for an assimilatory nitrite reductase  are found in p. acidipropionici and m. phosphovorus. however, the enzyme of the former is nonfunctional due to a frameshift in the large subunit.

the sulfur assimilation pathway also varies among propionibacteria, with species utilizing from the most oxidized sources  to the most reduced ones 
 <cit> . an adenylylsulfate kinase  was only found in m. phosphovorus. the coding genes for nitrite/sulfite reductase , sulfate adenylyltransferase  and phosphoadenylyl-sulfate reductase  coding genes were found in the genomes of p. acidipropionici, p. freudenreichii and m. phosphovorus, but not in p. acnes. however, it was not possible to identify the complete pathway of sulfate reduction in p. acidipropionici, thus requiring more studies.

p. freudenreichii and p. acnes have genes coding for all three subunits of anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide  reductase, allowing these bacteria to use dmso and other highly oxidized substrates as electron acceptors.

vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis
cobalamin  is one of the most structurally complex nonpolymeric biomolecule described and is an essential cofactor for several important enzymes like methylmalonyl-coa mutase
 <cit> . the complexity of its synthesis makes a chemical production too challenging and expensive. hence, the industrial production of this vitamin is currently performed by biosynthetic fermentation processes using two organisms: propionibacterium freudenreichii  and pseudomonas denitrificans. since some propionibacterium species do not produce either endo- or exotoxins, they are preferred for the production of food additives or medicines. pseudomonas produce vitamin b <dig> by the aerobic pathway, whereas propionibacteria use the anaerobic one, which differs from the first in that the cobalt ion is inserted much earlier, at the precorrin- <dig> intermediate. the oxidation step also differs as it cannot use o <dig> and generates a 6- rather than a 5-membered lactone
 <cit> .

m. phosphovorus uses the aerobic pathway and the characteristic oxygen-requiring c- <dig> hydroxylase cobg and the distinct cobalt insertion complex  were identified . the organization of b <dig> biosynthesis genes of p. acidipropionici is similar to that of p. acnes, with genes grouped into two clusters , while p. freudenreichii has its genes grouped into four gene clusters. the small cluster  harbors genes responsible for providing aminolaevulinic acid and converting it to uroporphyrinogen iii, as well as the interconversion of uroporphyrinogen iii into haem. the large cluster  harbors genes responsible for cobalt transport and adenosylcobalamin synthesis from uroporphyrinogen iii. some genes coding for transport proteins are only present in the cluster from p. acnes. fused genes also differ between the three genomes. while cbiegh appears in the three propionibacteria, cobt, cobu and blub are organized differently. p. acnes large cluster harbors cobt and cobu genes fused into a single protein , while p. acidipropionici large cluster contains two separate adjacent genes . p. freudenreichii have cobu as a separate gene inside one cluster, and cobt fused to the blub gene and located elsewhere in its genome. this fused gene, cobt/blub, is also present in the p. acnes genome, but a blub homolog was not found in p. acidipropionici genome. blub, first identified in rhodobacter capsulatus, was shown to be required for the conversion of cobinamide to cobalamin in various organisms, being responsible for the oxygen-dependent synthesis of dimethylbenzimidazole from reduced flavin mononucleotide 
 <cit> . since p. acidipropionici does not possess this gene, another unidentified enzyme may catalyze this reaction.

propionic acid fermentation
as expected, the dicarboxylic acid pathway, known as wood werkman cycle, was identified in the p. acidipropionici genome . many bacteria of different genera as rhodospirillum, mycobacterium, rhizobium, micrococcus and propionibacterium have the mechanisms required for propionic acid fermentation metabolism
 <cit> . nonetheless, it is only in propionibacterium that this is the main pathway for energy generation, resulting in high propionic acid production. propionic acid production is a cyclic process, in which propionate formation is related to the oxidation of pyruvate to acetate and to reduction of fumarate to succinate. we identified thirteen genes in the p. acidipropionici genome that could encode the enzymes involved in propionate production from pyruvate: methylmalonyl-coa carboxyltransferase , malate dehydrogenase , fumarate hydratase , succinate dehydrogenase , propionyl-coa:succinate coa-transferase , methylmalonyl-coa epimerase  and methylmalonyl-coa mutase .

importantly, two main divergences from the literature were found. the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxytransphosphorylase  that would lead to the formation of oxalacetate from co <dig> and phosphoenolpyruvate is not present in p. acidipropionici, p. acnes, p. freudenreichii or m. phosphovorus genomes. in addition, the acetate dissimilation pathway differs from previous reports
 <cit> . p. acidipropionici does not contain the phosphate acetyltransferase  and acetate kinase  genes; therefore, the two step pta-ack pathway cannot be the one that is used for acetate assimilation or dissimilation as was thought previously. instead, this bacteria seems to dissimilate acetate using an adp-forming acetyl-coa synthetase , an enzyme that is distinct from the broadly distributed amp-acs and which is instead related to the adp-forming succinyl-coa synthetase complex 
 <cit> . unlike pta and ack, adp-acs converts acetyl-coa, inorganic phosphate and adp into acetate, atp and coa in one step
 <cit> . the protein encoded by adp-acs gene was found in all proteome samples of p. acidipropionici, where acetate production was also observed. the pta and ack genes were identified in the genomes of p. freudenreichii and m. phosphovorus but not in the genomes of p. acidipropionici and p. acnes. an adp-acs gene was only identified in p. acidipropionici and related genes from the scsc  were also found in all the compared organisms except p. freudenreichii. the acetate assimilation is probably performed by amp-forming acs enzymes . although reversible in vitro, the reaction carried out by these enzymes is irreversible in vivo because of the presence of intracellular pyrophosphatases. in e. coli, this high affinity pathway scavenges small amounts of environmental acetate, while pta-ack pathway works only with large concentrations of the substrate
 <cit> . in this way, p. acidipropionici resembles some halophilic archaea which do not have the pta-ack pathway and use amp-acs and adp-acs enzymes to assimilate and dissimilate acetate, respectively.

n-propanol production
in addition to propionic, succinic and acetic acid, it has been reported that n-propanol might be produced under specific conditions; for example, in the fermentation of p. acidipropionici using glycerol as the carbon source
 <cit> . in this case, n-propanol production by p. acidipropionici could have resulted by a necessity to balance the intracellular redox potential, since glycerol is more reduced when compared to glucose
 <cit> . the genome analysis identified a possible metabolic pathway for n-propanol production: propionyl-coa could be converted to propionaldehyde and then to n-propanol by oxidation-reduction reactions catalyzed by the aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes. genes coding for aldehyde dehydrogenases that could act on propionyl-coa are pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig> and pacid_ <dig>  the genome of p. acidipropionici contains many alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes, and one or more could be responsible for producing propanol, including pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig>  pacid_ <dig> and pacid_ <dig> 

indeed, to change the fermentation pattern of p. acidipropionici towards higher yields of reduced compounds like propionic acid and n-propanol, it would be necessary to modify the nadh:nad cofactor ratio. the influence of the nadh:nad ratio in metabolic pathways has been demonstrated, for example, by using substrates with different oxidation states
 <cit>  or by supplementing anaerobic growth with electron acceptors, such as nitrate and fumarate
 <cit> . some studies have also report that the cofactor ratio can be varied through nadh regeneration by the nad-dependent formate dehydrogenase found in some species of yeast and bacteria. this enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of formate to co <dig> and the reduction of nad to nadh
 <cit> . moreover, the intracellular redox potential could be modified in the presence of a low-potential electron mediator, which transfers electrons between a working electrode and a bacterial cell. fermentation studies carried out with different strains of propionibacterium in a three-electrode amperometric culture system showed that high yields of the reduced compounds could be produced from oxidized substrates, such as glucose and lactate
 <cit> . n-propanol production was also observed in bioelectrical reactors with p. acidipropionici atcc <dig> fermenting sucrose in different mediator concentrations
 <cit> .

co <dig> fixation
heterotrophic co <dig> fixation was reported for the first time in p. pentosaceum, later renamed as p. acidipropionici <cit> . wood and leaver
 <cit>  tested the fermentation of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> carbon compounds by this bacterium and found that the best co <dig> assimilation occurred when cells were grown on a medium containing glycerol, yeast extract, phosphate and vitamin b. in the same study, they also reported the inhibition of co <dig> fixation by naf . in  <dig>  siu et al. <cit>  reported that the pepc enzyme obtained from sonic extracts of p. shermanii was able to catalyze the formation of oxaloacetate from co <dig> and phosphoenolpyruvate. pepc is widespread in plants, algae, cyanobacteria, bacteria and protozoa and has a highly conserved domain; the bacterial proteins have approximately  <dig> residues
 <cit> . however, similarity searches did not identify a homolog of pepc in the genomes of p. acidipropionici p. acnes, p. freudenreichii and m. phosphovorus.

to investigate the co <dig> assimilation by p. acidipropionici we performed fermentation assays using glycerol as the substrate in the presence of 13co <dig>  the nmr results  revealed an increase in the carbonyl group peak of propionic acid in relation to the control, indicating that a certain amount of isotope 13c was fixed by the co <dig> assimilation pathway. hence, we concluded that p. acidipropionici can indeed fix co2; however, the enzyme responsible for this reaction may not be pepc. an inspection of the p. acidipropionici genome led to the identification of a gene encoding pyruvate carboxylase , an enzyme that catalyzes the following reaction:

  pyruvate+atp+hco3−+h+→oxalacetate+adp+phosphate 

a pyruvate carboxylase was also identified in the m. phosphovorus genome  but not in the p. acnes and p. freudenreichii genomes. co <dig> assimilation by p. acidipropionici occurs mainly when glycerol is used as the carbon source
 <cit> . therefore, this pathway could be related to the necessity to balance the intracellular redox potential when the glycerol reaches a high reduction potential. moreover, in the presence of glucose as carbon source the gene for carbon dioxide fixation could be repressed due to a carbon catabolite repression mechanism
 <cit> . the proteome experiments led to the identification of this protein in all samples obtained from p. acidipropionici cells growing in glycerol, but not from cells grown in glucose . although this result supports our hypothesis, further experiments should be performed to elucidate the co <dig> assimilatory pathway and its regulation.

the pyruvate carboxylase is member of the biotin-dependent carboxylase family. members of this family are post-transcriptionally biotinylated by a biotin protein ligase, usually present at one copy in prokaryotes and able to biotinylate different carboxylases. prokaryotes have either one monofunctional protein that only performs the biotinylation or a bifunctional protein containing an n-terminus regulatory domain that participates in the transcriptional control of genes involved in biotin biosynthesis
 <cit> . the four bacteria compared seem to have one copy each of the monofunctional protein, since the typical n-terminal biotin operon repressor domain  was not found in these proteins.

the heterotrophic co <dig> fixation emphasizes the potential use of p. acidipropionici in industrial applications, once it enables the industrial propionic acid production from low feedstock amounts and fermentation released co <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the genome-scale information that we have obtained combined with already developed physiological, genetic and metabolic approaches will increase our knowledge of p. acidipropionici and may help establish strategies that will increase and optimize its use in industrial processes. the experimental results and genome annotations have revealed some p. acidipropionici features that may explain the plasticity and hardiness of this specie. p. acidipropionici has about  <dig>  genes more than p. acnes and p. freudenreichii, suggesting less specialization and a more flexible metabolism. genes for the defense of genome integrity by the crispr/cas system, polyphosphate accumulation, and the large amount of rrna and carbohydrate abc transporters that were identified might also render some competitive advantages and allow the bacterium to adapt in different environments. in addition, the high acid tolerance, wide range of substrates metabolized, hardiness and microaerophilic life style suggest that p. acidipropionici is a microorganism that has a potential use in the industrial fermentation of commodities, such as propionic acid. moreover the antifungal property of propionic acid will help avoid the contamination of the process by indigenous yeast, the main source of contamination in sugarcane juice
 <cit> . propionic acid fermentation from sugarcane juice, therefore, could be performed without strict microbial control and, consequently, in a cost-effective manner.

worldwide interest in chemical compounds produced by biological reactors has increased considerably, especially in the petrochemical industry that has as a main objective, the low cost production of compounds that could be fixed in high durable materials. in this context, propionic acid fermentation by p. acidipropionici shows a great potential to satisfy the world demand for this commodity.
