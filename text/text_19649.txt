BACKGROUND
in t cells, chromatin structure can be dependent on cell fate, cell activation, or both. this is well illustrated in the case of the th <dig> cytokine cluster, containing the th <dig> cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . the th <dig> cytokines are exclusively expressed in th cells that have differentiated into the th <dig> lineage and only upon t cell activation. dnase i hypersensitivity site  mapping of the cytokine loci from different th subsets revealed dramatic changes in chromatin accessibility across the locus in th <dig> cells compared to other th lineages and undifferentiated th precursors ; typically, dhs are nucleosome-free regions created by chromatin remodeling proteins directed by the binding of transcription factors  <cit> . many of the dhs were subsequently determined both genetically and biochemically to be enhancer and silencer elements important to th <dig> cytokine expression and were marked with lineage-specific changes in histone modifications  <cit> . although changes in nuclease accessibility across cytokine loci in response to differentiation and activation signals have been well documented, less is known about to the specific enzymes responsible for these changes  <cit> .

il- <dig> was originally described as a th2-specific cytokine, and the il- <dig> gene is located on a different chromosome from the th <dig> cytokine gene cluster  <cit> . like the th <dig> cytokines, il- <dig> expression in th <dig> cells is accompanied by changes in the accessibility in the il- <dig> locus directed by both lineage and activation-specific signals  <cit> . more recently the expression of il- <dig> has been shown to be less restricted and more plastic than the classical th <dig> cytokines. both th <dig> and th <dig> cells can express il- <dig> under specific conditions, while the newly described th <dig> subset produces high levels of il- <dig> along with il- <dig>  <cit> . biologically, il- <dig> exhibits strong immunosuppressive effects and serves to attenuate immune responses. this is illustrated in the development of profound inflammatory bowel disease and exaggerated immune responses in il-10-deficient mice  <cit> . indeed, some treg cell populations, critical for the negative regulation of immune responses, mediate their activity through il- <dig> expression  <cit> . a number of studies have linked genetic variants at the il- <dig> gene to human disease  <cit> .

atp-dependent remodeling enzymes contain swi2/snf2-like atpase subunits, and these atpases couple the hydrolysis of atp to changes in chromatin structure. swi/snf, mi <dig>  iswi, and other atp-dependent remodeling enzymes are classified into subfamilies based upon homology of the atpase subunit  <cit> . these remodeling enzymes appear to both activate and repress gene expression  <cit> . swi/snf complexes are arguably the best-characterized atp-dependent remodeling enzymes in t lymphocytes, with demonstrated functions in both early t cell development and t cell effector function  <cit> . mammalian swi/snf complexes contain one copy of either the brg <dig> or brm atpase, and approximately  <dig> additional accessory subunits to form complexes that are generally over a megadalton in size. two versions of swi/snf complex, baf and pbaf, have been described, based on subunit composition  <cit> , as well as other complexes specific to es cells and neurons  <cit> . for example, baf complexes contain either the brg <dig> or brm atpase, and either baf250a or baf250b. pbaf complexes contain baf <dig>  baf <dig> and the brg <dig> atpase but not brm. importantly, baf and pbaf complexes appear to regulate different target genes  <cit> .

previous we identified baf250-containing baf complexes as important chromatin remodelers of cytokine loci in t cells  <cit>  and, in es cells, regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal  <cit> . baf complexes have established roles in cell cycle  <cit>  and tumorigenesis  <cit> . pbaf complexes are known to be important in coronary development  <cit> . however, a role for pbaf complexes in t cell differentiation and effector function has not been explored. the pbaf specific swi/snf component, baf <dig> or polybromo , appears to direct the regulation of a unique set of target genes  <cit> . baf180-deficient mice have defects in cardiac development that include the specific misregulation of retinoic acid-induced genes  <cit> . baf <dig> also plays an important role in the regulation of the cell cycle due, at least in part, to its ability to activate the transcription of the cell cycle regulator p <dig>  <cit> . baf <dig> mutations have been identified in breast and renal cancers suggesting baf <dig> is a tumor suppressor gene  <cit> . mutation of another pbaf component, baf200/arid <dig>  is found in hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . the baf <dig> protein includes an hmg dna binding domain, two bromo-adjacent homology domains involved in protein-protein interactions and an array of six tandem bromodomains shown to bind to specific acetylated histone residues  <cit> . recruitment of baf <dig> to its specific gene targets has been suggested to involve interactions with other proteins, including transcription factors, and the recognition of specific histone signatures.

in this study we examine the role of baf180-containing pbaf complexes in cd4+ t cells. using cells from mice conditionally deleted for baf <dig> in t cells, we found that overall thymus and peripheral t cell development was intact. additionally, the ex-vivo differentiation of cd <dig> t helper cells into different effector fates was not absolutely dependent on baf <dig>  however, baf <dig> appeared to function as a repressor of the immunoregulatory cytokine, il- <dig>  in th <dig> cells. baf <dig> bound directly to regulatory elements in the il- <dig> locus but was replaced by baf250-containing baf complexes in the absence of baf <dig>  resulting in increased histone acetylation and cbp recruitment to the il- <dig> locus. these results suggest that the differential recruitment of different swi/snf subtypes  can have direct consequences on gene transcription and cell fate in t cells.

methods
mice
the generation of baf <dig> conditional ko es cell lines and mice are similar to that applied in baf250a kos  <cit> . the baf <dig> genomic sequences used for generating the initial kos  <cit>  were subcloned into the conditional ko vector  <cit> . the generation of baf <dig> conditional ko es cell lines and mice are similar to that applied in baf250a kos  <cit> . briefly, two frt and two loxp sites, together with a polylinker sequence, were engineered into a vector containing a promoterless β-geo trapping cassette derived from pgt <dig>  dna fragments ~ <dig> kb in length were pcr-amplified from genomic dna 5' and 3' of exon  <dig> of baf <dig> and inserted into the targeting vector as applied previously for conventional baf <dig> ko. a  <dig> -kb fragment containing exon  <dig> was pcr-amplified and inserted upstream of the β-geo trapping cassette. the baf <dig> conditional knockout vector was linearized by noti digestion and electroporated into e <dig> feeder-independent es cells to generate heterozygous es lines after selection in g <dig>  targeted es lines were confirmed by southern analysis. spe i digestion produces a  <dig> -kb fragment for wild type  allele and a  <dig> -kb fragment for a mutant allele. the probe used is located between the spe i sites and distal to the 5' recombination region as applied previously for conventional baf <dig> ko. baf <dig> heterozygous mice were obtained as described and these mice were kept in a b6- <dig> mixed genetic background before they were crossed to cd4-cre mice. all other procedures were as described previously  <cit> . cd4-cre mice were obtained from taconic. animal approval was from the nia acuc, protocol asp-365-mjp-mi, and all experiments conform to the relevant regulatory standards.

cell culture
mouse t cells were isolated and cultured essentially as described previously  <cit> . naïve thp cells were purified from lymph node and spleens by using cd <dig> + cd62+ t cell isolation kit  to 95% purity. lymphocytes were cultured in rpmi  <dig> supplemented with 10% fcs,  <dig> u/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin,  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate,  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig> mm hepes,  <dig> μm β-mercaptoethanol. purified naïve thp cells were plated onto anti-cd <dig> , anti-cd <dig>  coated plates at 1- <dig> ×  <dig> in the presence of  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig>   <dig> μg/ml anti-ifnγ  or  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig>   <dig> μg/ml anti-il- <dig> . il- <dig>  was added  <dig> h later. cultures were expanded in il- <dig>   <dig> days after initial culture. for th <dig> differentiation naïve thp cells were cultured with soluble anti-cd <dig> , soluble anti-cd <dig> ,  <dig> μg/ml of both anti-il- <dig> and anti-ifnγ,  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig>   <dig> ng/ml il-1β and  <dig> ng/ml tgf-β. th <dig> cells were expanded in  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig>  proper differentiation was confirmed by intracellular cytokine staining for th lineage signature cytokines and mrna analysis.

facs analysis
cells were stained, then analyzed on a facscalibur  using cellquest software and standard methods. fluorescently labeled antibodies to cd <dig>  cd62l, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and b <dig> were all purchased from bd pharmingen. before staining, fc receptors were blocked with anti-cd16/ <dig> ab . negative controls consisted of isotype-matched, conjugated, nonspecific abs . intracellular cytokine staining was performed using the intracellular cytokine staining kit . briefly, the cells were stimulated with pma and ionomycin for  <dig> hours in the presence of brefeldin a. the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized and subsequently stained for cytokine expression using antibodies purchased from bd pharmingen.

cell proliferation
naïve thp cells were plated in triplicate at  <dig>  cells per well of a  <dig> well plate in the presence of the indicated amounts of plate bound anti-cd <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml anti-cd <dig> . proliferation was assessed after  <dig> h incubation using cyquant

cell proliferation assay . fluorescence was measured on a cytofluor  <dig> fluorescent plate reader. each bar is the average and standard deviation of three wells and representative of three independent experiments.

rna analysis
total rna was purified using rneasy columns . cdna was made using iscript  according to the manufacturer's instructions. steady state mrna levels of indicated genes were determined by real time pcr using sybr green  on an abi  <dig>  ongoing transcription of il- <dig> was measured by detection of the il- <dig> primary  transcript. expression levels were normalized to mtbp  <cit>  or m-actin as indicated. oligo sequences are in table 1; il- <dig> primary transcript oligo pair is il- <dig> pri.

illumina oligonucleotide microarray analysis
three pairs of rna's from resting and stimulated wt and baf180-/- th <dig> cells were analyzed by microarray analysis. transcriptional profiling was determined using illumina beadchips as described previously  <cit> . briefly, total rna was used to generate biotin-labeled crna using the illumina totalprep rna amplification kit. a total of  <dig>  ug of biotin-labeled crna was hybridized at 58°c for  <dig> h to illumina's sentrix mouse ref-8v <dig> expression beadchips . the arrays were washed, blocked and the labeled crna was detected by staining with streptavidin-cy <dig>  hybridized arrays were scanned using an illumina beadstation 500× genetic analysis systems scanner and the image data extracted using the illumina genomestudio software, version  <dig> . <dig> . for statistical analysis, the expression data were filtered to include only probes with a consistent signal on each chip, and a detection p value of less than or equal to  <dig>  for at least one sample of the data. the resulting dataset was next analyzed with diane  <dig> , a spreadsheet-based microarray analysis program. an overview of diane can be found online at http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/rrb/dna/diane_software.pdf. using diane, the results were normalized with a z-score transformation  <cit> . z-normalized data were then analyzed with principal component analysis . to determine the gene expression changes within each specific rna comparison, z-scores for paired treatment groups were compared using the z-ratio statistic  <cit> :

 z-ratio=z-scorelps-z-scorevehicleσ 

expression changes for individual genes were considered significant if they met four criteria: z-ratio above  <dig>  or below - <dig> ; false detection rate   <cit>  of less than  <dig> ; a p-value statistic for z-score replicability below  <dig> ; and mean background-corrected signal intensity greater than zero. differentially expressed genes were identified as significant  based on z-scores. gene set analysis using go gene sets with the page  <cit>  algorithm was performed as previously described  <cit> . the data are publicly available at geo .

immunoblot analysis
whole cell extracts were prepared from th <dig> cells by lysing cells in  <dig> mm tris  <dig> , 1% np <dig>   <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> % deoxycholate,  <dig> % sds and clearing the lysates by centrifugation. protein extracts were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a pvdf membrane . the immunoblots were blocked for  <dig> h at room temperature in 5% milk in tbst  and incubated with the baf <dig> antibody  or brg <dig> antibody  overnight at 4°c. the blots were washed with tbst and incubated with anti-rabbit hrp-conjugated antibody  at room temperature. after washing the blots with tbst, detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence  according to manufacturer's instructions.

chromatin immunoprecipitation 
chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using methods similar to those described previously  <cit> ; details are available on request. approximately  <dig> million cells  were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde and quenched with glycine. cells were lysed with buffer containing 1% sds, treated with micrococcal nuclease, sonicated until the average dna size was approximately  <dig> bp, and adjusted to  <dig> % sds, 1% triton x- <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl at  <dig> ml. sonicates were precleared with protein a sepharose  and ip was performed with the following antibodies:  <dig> ug h3k9ac ,  <dig>  ul brg <dig> ,  <dig> ug h3k18ac ,  <dig> ug h3k4me ,  <dig> ug baf <dig> ,  <dig> ug baf <dig> ,  <dig> ug cbp  or rabbit igg . chromatin was collected with protein a, washed, eluted with te ph  <dig>  and crosslinks were reversed, followed by protease treatment. chromatin was quantified by real-time pcr  using an applied biosystems  <dig> with sybr green detection . graphs indicate immunoprecipitated chromatin amounts relative to input dna . oligo sequences are in table  <dig>

RESULTS
t lymphocyte development is essentially normal when the baf <dig> gene is deleted relatively late in thymocyte development
previous work from our laboratory identified a role for brg-containing swi/snf complexes in the differentiation of th <dig> cells as well as in the acute induction cytokine genes from th <dig> and il-3/gmcsf loci  <cit> . additionally, using sirna technology in effector th cells we identified baf250a-containing baf complexes as an important swi/snf component in th <dig> and il-3/gmcsf cytokine expression  <cit> . by contrast, we did not identify a role for baf180-containing pbaf complexes in effector th <dig> cytokine expression and did not explore the role of baf <dig> in th <dig> differentiation. however, it remained possible that the sirna-mediated partial depletion of baf <dig> was not sufficient to reveal the role of baf <dig> in t cells. to more thoroughly explore this issue we made use of a mouse strain made conditionally deficient for baf <dig> in t cells  <cit> . since we were testing the role of baf <dig> in peripheral cd <dig> t cell function, we chose the cd <dig> promoter/enhancer driver for cre recombinase expression, as this expression cassette is expressed at a relatively late stage of thymocyte development  <cit> ; we also expected t cell specific deletion would bypass the coronary and trophoblast defects occurring in embryos lacking baf <dig>  <cit> .

as expected, in the presence of the cre recombinase transgene, we observed complete loss of baf <dig> protein expression in t cells from baf180fl/fl mice . by contrast, there was little if any effect on brg <dig>  another swi/snf component. loss of baf <dig> protein expression did not grossly affect cell number from the thymus, spleen or lymph nodes  suggesting that overall t cell development and expansion was not strongly affected by the loss of baf <dig> at this late stage. this was further supported by facs analysis showing typical staining profiles for cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cell subsets in both the thymus and lymphoid periphery, as well as typical t:b cell ratios in the spleen .

we detected two subtle changes in baf180-deficient peripheral cd <dig> t cells. first, although the naïve and central memory marker cd62l was unchanged in baf180-deficient t cells, we observed a general down-regulation of the memory marker cd <dig> in peripheral t cells . we do not know whether the loss of cd <dig> expression was a direct consequence of reduced cd <dig> transcription when baf <dig> no longer functions on the cd <dig> gene, or alternatively an indirect effect of altered memory cell function in the absence of baf <dig>  in support of the former possibility, cd <dig> was one of the first bona fide swi/snf target genes identified in mammalian cells  <cit> . additionally, we observed direct recruitment of pbaf complexes to multiple transcriptional elements in the cd <dig> gene  suggesting that baf <dig> was a direct positive regulator of cd <dig> expression in t cells. second, baf180-deficient cd <dig> t cells consistently displayed a slight decrease in proliferative response to t cell stimulation . this correlated with a small increase in the expression of cell cycle inhibitors in baf180-deficient t cells .

enhanced th <dig> differentiation in the absence of baf180
in order to determine if baf <dig> is involved in th differentiation, we purified naïve cd <dig> t cells  from wildtype and baf180-deficient mice and cultured the cells under th <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> skewing conditions ; throughout this study, restimulated cells were activated with pma and ionomycin. analysis of expression of th-subset specific cytokines and transcription factors revealed that, in the absence of baf <dig>  th-differentiation was largely intact . additionally, baf180-deficient t cells expanded similarly to wildtype t cells when cultured under skewing conditions with exogenous cytokines. we did consistently observe a slight enhancement of il- <dig> expression and a larger increase in il- <dig> expression in baf180-deficient th <dig> cells . these results suggest that baf180-deficient th cells are largely capable of differentiating into several th lineages and express th cytokines appropriately. however, baf <dig> appeared to repress il- <dig> and perhaps il- <dig> in th <dig> cells.

deletion of baf <dig> alters gene expression in th <dig> cells
after observing some changes in candidate gene expression in baf180-deficient th <dig> cells, we expanded our analysis in a comprehensive, unbiased manner using beadchip analysis. we identified baf180-dependent gene expression in resting and restimulated th <dig> cells and naïve cd4+ th cells; primary data were deposited in geo . we found the expression of approximately  <dig>  genes was augmented or diminished in a statistically significant manner, following depletion of baf <dig> protein in one or more of these conditions . more genes were affected in resting cells than in stimulated cells. in resting cells, more genes were upregulated than downregulated after deletion of baf <dig>  suggesting the major function of baf <dig> in resting th cells was to repress gene expression. more genes were affected in differentiated cells than in naïve cells.

among go term gene sets in stimulated th <dig> cells, decreased expression in pathways involving nucleosome assembly, transcription and dna binding were evident in baf180-deficient th <dig> cells, while pathways involving ribosome biogenesis and translation were increased. pathways altered in baf180-/- th <dig> cells involving immune cell function included "positive regulation of t cell differentiation" and "natural killer cell activation". genes that appeared to be repressed by baf <dig> in th <dig> cells included il- <dig>  il2ra, furin, ctla <dig>  icos, foxp <dig>  rgs <dig>  nras, e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  cdkn2a, nfil <dig> and jmjd1a. genes that appeared to be activated by baf <dig> in th <dig> cells included cd <dig>  stat <dig>  jak <dig>  twistnb, daxx, igf1r, prkca, chd <dig> bcl <dig> cdk <dig>  rb <dig>  ikbke, egr <dig>  and adar. in naïve cells, repressed genes included cdkn1a, foxp <dig>  gata <dig>  ifng, il17f, dnmt3b, while activated genes included dicer <dig>  gadd45a, and smad <dig>  we note we had also identified cdkn1a and cdkn2a as repression targets using a candidate gene approach . baf <dig> repression targets in resting and stimulated th <dig> cells were largely distinct; only a small number of targets were shared. interestingly, the gene most enhanced by baf180-deficiency in both resting and activated th <dig> cells was il- <dig> suggesting a role for baf <dig> in the down-regulation of this cytokine.

il- <dig> expression in th <dig> cells is negatively regulated by baf180
we validated the il- <dig> expression changes in baf180-deficient th <dig> cells at both the protein and rna level. using intracellular cytokine staining, we observed that the number of il- <dig> producing th <dig> cells increased from 16% to 38% in the absence of baf <dig> . this correlated well with 2- <dig> fold enhanced il- <dig> mrna production in both resting and activated baf180-deficient th <dig> cells . to determine if the enhanced il- <dig> expression was due to increased transcription, we quantified the il- <dig> primary  transcript and similarly found an increase of at least  <dig> fold in resting and activated baf180-/- cells .  in wt cells, while the mrna increased  <dig> fold  and  <dig> fold ; while these differences may reflect experiment to experiment variation, they also provide some support for regulation of il- <dig> mrna stability.) these results demonstrate that the transcription of il- <dig> is elevated in the absence of baf <dig> and suggest that baf <dig> is a repressor of il- <dig> transcription.

enhanced baf recruitment and histone acetylation at il- <dig> locus in th cells lacking baf180
the il- <dig> locus is marked by a number chromatin structure changes in th <dig> cells in response to both activation and lineage-specific signals  <cit> . these modifications include histone acetylation, methylation and the generation of dnase i hypersensitive sites present over many kilobases upstream and downstream the il- <dig> coding sequence. we examined the landscape of brg <dig> binding and stat transcription factor binding at this locus using chip-seq data. we found brg <dig> at several regions near the il- <dig> gene . binding was strongest at regions upstream and downstream from the il- <dig> promoter than at the promoter itself, as seen previously with cytokine genes  <cit> . more and stronger brg <dig> binding was found in stimulated cells than in resting cells, and in th <dig> fate than in other fates. brg <dig> binding was statistically significant at - <dig>  k, - <dig>  k, - <dig> k, - <dig> k, + <dig>  k, + <dig>  k, and + <dig>  k. previous studies found dnase hypersensitivity at most of these sites  <cit> ; brg <dig> has previously been found to play a role in formation of dhs  <cit> . we note that stat transcription factor binding overlaps with a number of these sites, and suggest that transcription-factor mediated recruitment might explain some of the observed brg <dig> binding. interestingly, stat <dig> binding occurs in th <dig> cells at locations lacking stat <dig> in th <dig> cells; these could be negatively acting sites.

we examined brg <dig>  baf <dig>  and baf <dig> binding at the il- <dig> locus using chip-pcr. we found brg <dig> binding at several regions, consistent with the chip-seq results ; brg <dig> binding was strongest at - <dig>  k, - <dig>  k, - <dig>  k, - <dig> k, and + <dig>  k. brg <dig> binding was low in naïve cells, induced during differentiation, decreased in resting cells, and was strongest in re-stimulated cells , as seen with the th <dig> cytokine loci  <cit> . we found brg <dig> was required during th <dig> differentiation to establish dhs at - <dig> k and + <dig>  k , as found previously at the il- <dig> and gata <dig> promoters  <cit> . the binding of the brg <dig> paralog brm was similar to brg <dig> . brg <dig> binding was not affected by baf <dig> deletion at some sites, such as - <dig> k, while other sites such as - <dig>  k brg <dig> and the above-mentioned stat <dig> binding sites in th <dig> cells, brg <dig> binding was reduced. we next examined baf <dig> binding to the il- <dig> locus; we detected baf <dig> binding especially at distal sites  and the il- <dig> promoter in th <dig> cells . the pattern of baf <dig> binding was similar to brg <dig>  with the prominent exception that little if any baf <dig> binding occurred at - <dig> k, a strong brg <dig> binding site. as expected, baf <dig> binding was absent in baf180-deficient th <dig> cells . finally we measured baf250a binding as a marker of baf complexes. we detected enhanced binding of baf250a to distal elements and the il- <dig> promoter in baf180-deficient th <dig> cells compared to wt cells . the strongest baf250a binding was to the il- <dig> promoter, a weak brg <dig> site, while there was little if any baf250a binding to - <dig> k, a strong brg <dig> site. these results suggest that while overall swi/snf recruitment is not strongly affected by baf180-deficiency, the composition of the swi/snf complex  is altered and thus changing the composition of swi/snf changes il- <dig> gene expression.

next, we examined histone modifications and modifiers at the il- <dig> locus using chip-pcr, as we had previously found brg <dig> regulated histone acetylation  <cit> . h3k4me <dig>  a mark frequently found at enhancers, was found at all the tested regions of the il- <dig> locus, especially at - <dig>  k, - <dig>  k, - <dig>  k, and - <dig> k . h3k4me <dig> was not strongly affected by deletion of baf <dig> , though il- <dig> expression was enhanced in baf180-deficient th <dig> cells. h3k18ac and h3k9ac, marks that are enriched at active enhancers and promoters  <cit> , were found at all the tested regions of the il- <dig> locus; h3k18ac was especially prominent at - <dig>  k and - <dig>  k, h3k9ac especially at the promoter and downstream regions . histone acetylation was elevated in baf180-deficient cells ; this difference was prominent at sites distal to the il- <dig> promoter . these results suggested that the replacement of pbaf complexes with baf complexes altered histone modifications of the locus, or alternatively that these histone modifications were acquired as a consequence of swi/snf-mediated transcriptional regulation. the cbp and p <dig> histone acetyltransferases been shown experimentally to generate the h3k18ac and h3k27ac modification  <cit>  associated with active enhancers and promoters  <cit> , and these paralogs bind similar targets  <cit> . we found cbp binding to many of the tested regions in the il- <dig> locus; we detected increased cbp recruitment to il- <dig> enhancers and the il- <dig> promoter in the absence of baf <dig> . therefore, the composition of specific swi/snf complexes can influence histone acetyltransferase recruitment and histone acetylation; as the changes in histone modifications do not always coincide with changes in baf <dig> binding, we do not know whether they are the result of looping, or spreading of histone modifications. these alterations in histone modifications might be programmed by swi/snf to direct transcription, or might be a consequence of transcription programmed by swi/snf.

binding of brg <dig> and transcription factors in the il24/il20/il19/il <dig> locus
il- <dig> is part of a multi-gene cluster in mouse and human. a recent report indicated that il- <dig> expression is th <dig> specific, mediated in part by stat <dig> function through the il- <dig> promoter  <cit> . we asked whether there might be functional elements dispersed throughout this locus, as found for the il4/il13/il <dig> locus; these can be identified through genomic analysis, especially when multiple datasets are combined  <cit> . we found brg <dig> binding clustered around the il- <dig> and il- <dig> genes . there were few if any binding regions in the central  <dig> kb interval containing the il- <dig> and il- <dig> genes. in resting and stimulated cell types, brg <dig> binding was th <dig> specific, and binding was stronger in stimulated cells. consistent with our previous global analysis and analysis of specific genes, these effects were not absolute; for example, there is substantial brg <dig> binding in th <dig> cells; it is not clear whether this is the result of combinatorial control, or if these sites can be both positively and negatively acting. stat <dig> and stat <dig> binding was present at numerous upstream and downstream regions, extending the observation of stat <dig> at the il- <dig> promoter. the location of statistically significant binding regions for both loci is presented as a table  of genomic coordinates and features, organized by factor/condition  and by genomic coordinate . we note that occupancy of the il- <dig> - <dig>  k and il- <dig> + <dig>  k sites was detected in cells that do not express these genes under these conditions; perhaps negative regulatory elements lie in these regions. we also note that the il- <dig> - <dig>  k, il- <dig> - <dig> k, il- <dig> + <dig>  k, and il- <dig> + <dig>  k elements are bound by brg <dig>  stat <dig>  stat5a and stat5b; perhaps these are especially important positive elements. we have confirmed that these elements are dhs in th <dig> cells .

discussion
we examined the role of atp-dependent chromatin remodeling in t cell function. our previous work identified an activating role for baf complexes, swi/snf complexes containing baf <dig>  in cytokine gene expression in t helper cells  <cit> . in the current study we examined the contribution of pbaf, a different swi/snf complex containing baf <dig>  in t cell function and cytokine expression using t cell specific baf180-deficient mice. we identified numerous baf180-dependent changes in gene expression in our microarray analysis; however, overall th cell development and cytokine expression were intact. baf <dig> was a negative regulator of il- <dig> transcription and, in the absence of baf <dig>  histone modifications were reprogrammed and baf250-containing baf complexes were recruited to the il- <dig> locus.

we find the binding patterns of baf <dig> and baf <dig> are overlapping, yet readily distinguishable. our data are consistent with the model that swi/snf exists in distinct baf and pbaf complexes, determined by several independent research groups examining different species. our data are also consistent with a stepwise assembly model, as proposed based upon time-resolved cell imaging studies  <cit> . these data are more difficult to reconcile with the proposal that baf <dig> and baf <dig> are, or can be, in the same complex  <cit> . we note that genetic studies have found different targets and functions for the baf-specific subunits baf250a/arid1a and baf250b/arid1b in es cells  <cit> . differences have also been found for the pbaf-specific subunits baf <dig>  baf <dig> and brd <dig>  <cit> . there may be different baf and pbaf complexes; alternatively, it may be that only some swi/snf subunits within a complex contribute to function at a particular locus. direct, comprehensive comparison of these subunits would extend our understanding of the swi/snf system.

the targeting of remodeling complexes to specific dna elements is mediated by association with transcription factors, histone modifications, non-coding rna and interactions with the general transcription machinery  <cit> . our previous studies identified important roles for transcription factors, particularly stats, in the recruitment of brg <dig> to specific regulatory elements in t cells  <cit> . interestingly, stat <dig> has been shown to be a critical transcription factor in the th2-specific expression of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> , and analysis of brg <dig> and stat <dig> chip-seq data reveal stat <dig> binding at many of the distal regulatory elements in the il- <dig> locus occupied by baf and pbaf complexes  <cit> . whether or not stat <dig> is mediating the recruitment of swi/snf to the il- <dig> locus or if stat <dig> preferentially interacts with baf or pbaf complexes remains to be determined. ets- <dig> is reported to be a repressor of il- <dig> expression  <cit> , and ets sequence motifs are enriched at brg <dig> binding sites in resting th cells  <cit> .

our recent examination of brg <dig> did not reveal repression as a prominent function for swi/snf, by comparison of th2s gene expression and brg <dig> binding  <cit> . we note that most baf180-mediated repression was in uth <dig> cells, and we did not examine resting cell gene expression in our previous work. alternatively, there may be more swi/snf activation targets than repression targets; this assessment awaits analysis of baf250a ko and brg <dig> ko th <dig> cells for direct comparison under identical conditions. a previous report suggested brm more important for repression, brg <dig> more important for activation  <cit> . it is unclear how baf <dig> complexes are mediating repression; they may be working as repressor complexes, or preventing the binding and function of activator complexes containing baf <dig> 

it is perhaps surprising that we found that deletion of baf <dig>  does not strongly perturb early t cell development. we have used a cre expression cassette that induces deletion at a late dn stage, potentially bypassing an earlier requirement for baf <dig> expression. several other factors, such as gata <dig>  brg <dig>  tcf <dig>  β-catenin and bptf, appear to be required for early t cell development  <cit> . given that brg <dig> has obvious effects on t cell development, we could have found that baf <dig> deletion would also have strong effects on t cell development. baf180-deficient mice have defects in cardiac development  <cit>  and baf <dig> is a cell cycle regulator in some settings  <cit> ; it is not clear what determines the relative importance of pbaf complexes in different cell states.

genetic variants within il- <dig> have been associated with human disease. the human snp rs <dig>  associated with type  <dig> diabetes, crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis  <cit> , maps to brg <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig> binding at + <dig>  k in the mouse. ulcerative colitis is also linked to rs <dig>  <cit> , within intron 3; this is  <dig> k upstream of brg <dig>  stat <dig> and cbp binding at + <dig>  k, and slightly downstream of brg <dig> binding and h3k <dig> acetylation at + <dig>  k. behcet's disease is associated with a variant  that lies near the il- <dig> promoter  <cit> , adjacent to brg <dig>  stat <dig> and cbp binding. the proximity of these genetic variants to these remodeling enzyme and transcription factor binding regions suggests these binding regions may regulate il- <dig> gene expression in a physiologically relevant manner.

previous studies on breast cancer cells suggested baf <dig> is a tumor suppressor gene that positively regulates the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p <dig> through direct interaction and activation of the p <dig> promoter  <cit> . a positive role for baf250a in the regulation of p <dig> transcription has been suggested in studies in a pre-osteoblast line  <cit> . however baf250a can also serve as a repressor of c-myc in these same cells while another baf-specific protein, baf250b, is an activator of c-myc  <cit> . we observed a slight decrease in the ability of baf180-deficient th cells to proliferate in response to t cell activation and enhanced expression of cell cycle inhibitors, including p <dig> , suggesting that in t cells baf <dig> is a repressor of these genes. we also observed binding of pbaf complexes to the p <dig> locus in t cells . at this time, there is no simple relationship between baf/pbaf complexes and cell cycle progression.

CONCLUSIONS
the relative contribution of different swi/snf subtypes in t cell gene expression is largely unknown. here we identify gene targets in th <dig> cells regulated by the pbaf-specific swi/snf component, baf <dig>  in particular, we find that baf <dig> is a repressor of il- <dig> gene transcription. baf <dig> binds directly to regulatory elements in the il- <dig> locus but is replaced by the baf-specific component, baf250a, in the absence of baf <dig>  resulting in enhanced histone acetylation at the il- <dig> locus. this study demonstrates that the differential recruitment of swi/snf subtypes can have direct consequences on chromatin structure and gene transcription.
