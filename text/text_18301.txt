BACKGROUND
perimenopause or the permanent end of menstruation and fertility is characterized by reduced estrogen levels and disorder of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary/adrenal axis. therefore, estrogen replacement therapy is commonly prescribed to increase the quality of life for individuals in perimenopause. however, significant risks have been associated with estrogen replacement therapy, including increased risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and cardiovascular events  <cit> . thus, better treatments without the associated risks are required.

granulosa cells  are responsible for estrogen synthesis within the ovary and subsequent follicular atresia, and their numbers decrease in perimenopause  <cit> . therapies that prevent their apoptosis may represent a novel treatment modality. previous studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells , including those derived from bone marrow , are capable of repairing a variety of injured tissues  <cit>  due to their potential to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, cardiocytes, and neural cells  <cit> . in rats with chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage, bmsc transplantation improved ovarian structure and function  <cit> . however, little is known about the therapeutic effects of bmscs on gc apoptosis associated with perimenopause.

the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of bmscs on the apoptosis of ovarian gcs in perimenopausal rats. bmsc and gc cultures were isolated from rats and characterized using microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. in vitro gc apoptosis was induced by cisplatin in gcs co-cultured with and without bmscs. in addition, gc apoptosis was analyzed in the perimenopausal rats treated with bmscs and estrogen using tunel assays and compared to untreated controls and young rats. bmsc therapy may represent a novel treatment for perimenopause that may have less deleterious effects than estrogen replacement therapy.

RESULTS
characterization of cultured bmscs and gcs
isolated bmscs in culture were characterized by microscopy and flow cytometry analyses. freshly isolated and cultured bmscs were adherent, with most displaying polygonal morphology . by the third passage, bmsc morphology resembled fibroblasts with few contaminant cells . most of the cultured bmscs expressed cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  but were negative for markers of the hematopoietic lineage, including cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  , which is consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

to determine the extent to which induction resulted in bmsc differentiation toward osteoblasts versus adipocytes lineages, cells were examined after von kossa staining. as shown in figure 1c  and 1d , isolated bmscs were capable of differentiating into both osteoblasts and adipocytes. furthermore, the basal secretion of large amounts of angiogenic and antiapoptotic factors from bmscs cells after three days in culture was observed and included  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml vascular endothelial growth factor ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml hepatocyte growth factor , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml insulin-like growth factor- <dig> .

isolated gcs were also characterized by microscopy and immunocytochemistry. cultured gcs were adherent and displayed polygonal morphology . cultured gcs also expressed intracellular follicle stimulating hormone receptor , confirming their identity as gcs .

effects of bmscs on gc apoptosis in vitro
to determine whether bmscs could protect gcs against cisplatin-induced apoptosis, gcs cultured in the absence or presence of bmscs were treated with cisplatin. as shown in figure  <dig>  cisplatin increased apoptosis from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the control and cisplatin groups, respectively . however, co-culture with bmscs significantly reduced gc apoptosis to  <dig> % .

real-time pcr analysis was next undertaken to determine the effect of bmsc co-culture on the mrna expression of apoptosis-related genes . although no significant changes in survivin and bcl- <dig> mrna expression were observed among the three treatment groups, differences in p <dig> , c-myc , and bax  mrna expression were detected. co-culture of gcs with bmscs significantly decreased p <dig> mrna expression . cisplatin treatment decreased c-myc mrna expression as compared to the control group , and this effect was ameliorated with bmsc co-culture. furthermore, a significant increase in bax mrna expression was observed with cisplatin treatment as compared to the control group ; however, it significantly decreased upon co-culture with bmscs .

effects of bmscs in an in vivo model of perimenopause
to determine if bmsc transplantation influences the gc apoptosis associated with perimenopause, an in vivo model was established in middle-aged rats . both treatment  and time  had significant effect on the apoptosis rates. however, the interaction of time and treatment on the apoptosis rates was not significant . as compared young rats, increased apoptosis was observed in the middle-aged rats after one month . after intervention with bmsc therapy or estrogen for 1 month, the apoptosis rate was lower than the control group although a significant difference was not observed. after 3 months, the apoptosis rate in the bmsc group  was significantly lower than that of the control group . no difference in estrogen treatment was observed.

discussion
in the present study, co-culture with bmscs significantly reduced cisplatin-mediated gc apoptosis and cisplatin-induced changes in p <dig>  bax, and c-myc mrna expression. in an in vivo model of perimenopause, the gc apoptosis rate was significantly lower in rats receiving bmsc therapy as compared to the control group after three months.

bmscs account for 1– <dig> per  <dig>  nucleated cells within bone marrow  <cit> . although their isolation is relatively simple and they amplify in abundance in vitro, an ideal marker of bmscs has yet to be identified. in this study, bmscs expressed cd <dig> and cd <dig>  but not cd <dig> and cd <dig>  which is in agreement with stagg et al.  <cit> . characterization of their differentiation potential confirmed their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes in vitro. in addition, bmscs can differentiate into chondrocytes, tenocytes, and neural cells  <cit> .

cisplatin induces dna crosslinking, which triggers apoptosis. in the present study co-culture with bmscs reduced gc apoptosis induced by cisplatin, which is in agreement with a previous study  <cit> . also, co-culture of gcs with bmscs downregulated the mrna expression of bax and p <dig> and upregulated c-myc mrna expression in gcs. bcl- <dig> and bax are both apoptosis regulating proteins that effect the mitochondria  <cit> ; bcl- <dig> competes with bax for interaction with adenine nucleotide translocator  on the mitochondrial membrane, preventing apoptosis  <cit> . in addition, p <dig> overexpression may promote apoptosis  <cit> ; it regulates the cell cycle through p53-dependent and independent pathways  <cit> . finally, c-myc promotes cell cycle progression from the g0/g <dig> phase to the s phase  <cit> ; its downregulation has been associated with bax oligomerization and subsequent activation of caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  resulting in apoptosis  <cit> . because bmscs and gcs were separated by a semipermeable membrane, protection by bmscs was elicited through secreted paracrine factors. however, further studies are necessary to identify the precise paracrine mediator responsible for this protective effect.

perimenopause is defined as occurring 12 months after the last menstrual period. at present, there are four animal models of perimenopause, including an ovarectomized animal model, a model that physically or pharmacologically disrupts of ovarian function, a 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide  follicle depletion model, and a natural aging animal model. the natural aging animal model was selected for this study as it most closely models the pathological changes associated with perimenopause.

bmsc transplantation reduced gc apoptosis, which is in accordance with two previous studies describing the restorative effects of mscs after their transplantation into ovaries  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which the bmscs influenced gc apoptosis remains unclear as they were introduced via injection into vena caudalis. for example, the transplanted bmscs may have reached the site of injury within the ovary and replaced damaged tissue through integration into the ovarian tissue and differentiation into the required cell type. alternatively, the bmscs may have induced tissue repair and prevented apoptosis by secreting paracrine mediators, including glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , tumor necrosis factor , basic fibroblast growth factor   <cit> , promoting functional recovery  <cit> . the latter mechanism is supported by the in vitro study that showed reduced gc apoptosis with bmsc co-culture, in which the cells were not in direct contact. furthermore, analysis of cell culture supernatant revealed that bmscs secreted igf- <dig>  hgf, and vegf-a. vegf promotes the formation of capillary networks, ensuring nutrition for gcs and oocytes  <cit> . in the ovary, igf- <dig> regulates dna replication of theca cells and gcs; it also regulates aromatase activity, secretion of inhibin, and generation of corpus luteum stimulating hormone receptor  <cit> . igf- <dig> also prevents cell cycle progression from g0/g <dig> to s via pi3k/akt signaling and inhibits fas receptor-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . finally, gcs express the hgf receptor, c-met  <cit> . uzumcu et al.  <cit>  reported that the level of hgf was inversely proportional to gc apoptosis, and hgf can reduce gc apoptosis in vivo and vitro. further studies will be undertaken to elucidate the mechanism by which bmscs influence gc apoptosis.

the present study has some limitations. for example, basic characterization of the perimenopausal rats was using vaginal smears to detect estrous cycle, estrous cycle disorders, and prolongation. however, the effects of perimenopause, estrogen therapy, or bmsc therapy on ovarian hormone levels in the serum were not determined. in addition, the in vivo study lacked a bmsc-only treatment group. furthermore, the protein levels of c-myc, p <dig>  survivin, bcl- <dig>  and bax were not assessed to corroborate the data obtained using rt-pcr. finally, the mechanism by which bmscs influence gc apoptosis  remains unclear and will be the subject of further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
bmscs decrease the gc apoptosis in vitro and vivo. further studies will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of bmsc therapy for perimenopausal symptoms as well as the basis for these effects.
