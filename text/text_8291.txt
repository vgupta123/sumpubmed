BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a newly identified class of small single-stranded non-coding rnas that range in length from roughly  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides . most mirna genes are thought to exist as independent transcriptional units and are transcribed by rna polymerase ii into long primary transcripts, termed pri-micrornas  <cit> . mature mirna formation is a multi-step process involving many complicated enzymes  <cit> . mirnas regulate their target genes via two main mechanisms: target mrna cleavage and translational repression. in plants, most mirnas have perfect or near perfect complementarity to their mrna targets and cleave them  <cit> . mirnas are involved in plant development, signal transduction, protein degradation, response to environmental stress and pathogen invasion, and they also regulate their own biogenesis  <cit> . in the past few years, more and more mirnas have been identified. however, their functions remain mostly unknown.

abiotic stresses such as drought, soil salinity, extreme temperatures, chemical toxicity and oxidative stress are serious threats to agriculture and result in environmental deterioration. for plants, drought and high salinity are the main abiotic stresses and are becoming widespread through the world. many genes and biochemical molecules are involved in the responses to abiotic stress in plants. however there is only a very limited view on mirnas involved in abiotic stress  <cit> . rice is a major worldwide crop for food supply, but its yield is frequently affected by abiotic stress. we had analyzed a mirna profile under drought stress in rice  and identified two drought-induced mirnas: mir-169g and mir- <dig>  <cit> . mir-169g was the only member of the mir- <dig> family induced by drought. sequence analysis revealed two proximate dres  in the upstream region of the mir-169g promoter, suggesting that mir-169g could be regulated directly by the transcriptional factors cbf/drebs, in response to abiotic stress in plants. these results suggested that mir-169g might play a role under drought stress in rice.

the ccaat box is one of the most common elements in eukaryotic promoters. it is present in 30% of all eukaryotic genes and is located  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs  upstream of the transcription start site   <cit> . the nf-y complex  was isolated as a ccaat-binding protein complex and is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that occurs in a wide range of organisms from yeast to humans. it includes three subunits: nf-ya , nf-yb , and nf-yc , all of which are required for dna binding  <cit> . in arabidopsis, there are  <dig> genes encoding for the nf-ya subunit,  <dig> genes for the nf-yb subunit and  <dig> genes for the nf-yc subunit  <cit> . further,  <dig> nf-ya genes,  <dig> nf-yb genes and  <dig> nf-yc genes have been identified in rice  <cit> . all of these plant nf-y genes contain an evolutionarily conserved domain, which is responsible for dna binding and protein-protein interactions, and various non-conserved regions in both length and amino acid sequence  <cit> .

in this study, we found that not only mir-169g but also mir-169n and mir-169o were induced by high salinity. mir-169n and mir-169o were located in a mirna gene cluster and derived from a recent tandem duplication event. there were dre and abre cis-acting elements in the upstream region of mir-169g and mir-169n-o, respectively. we also showed that nf-ya transcription factor, os03g <dig>  is a target gene of these salt-inducible mir- <dig> members and were cleaved rapidly after high salinity treatment. finally, we found that one or more ath-mir- <dig> member was also induced by high salinity. this indicated that some members of mir- <dig> family might be a general property in plants.

RESULTS
response of the mir- <dig> family to high salinity in rice
in our previous study, we identified mir-169g and mir- <dig> as drought-induced mirnas in rice  <cit> . studies have indicated the existence of significant crosstalk between drought and high-salt stress signaling pathways in plants. thus, we further tested the response of the mir- <dig> family to high-salt stress and wondered whether any members of mir- <dig> family were induced by high salinity. the high salinity environment was mimicked by  <dig> mm nacl. the rice seedlings were treated for  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours. mir- <dig> is a large mirna family containing  <dig> known members that represent nine different mature sequences with a little different  <cit> . seven probes that had been designed to distinguish these different mature sequences in our previous study were used to screen their responses to high salinity  <cit> . two probes  detected the induced signals . as in our previous study, the rt-pcr assay indicated that mir-169g, but not mir-169f, was induced by high salinity . however, the rt-pcr assay failed to distinguish mir-169n and mir-169o because of the high level of conservation in their stem-loop region . other members of mir- <dig> family showed either no induction by high salinity stress or no expression, in keep with our previous report .

mir-169n and mir-169o genes were involved in gene duplication evolution
by analyzing the genomic organization and sequence conservation of known mirna families, several studies had demonstrated that some mirnas evolved through segmental and tandem duplications in the same manner as protein-coding genes  <cit> . when we analyzed the gene organization of mir-169n and mir-169o, we found the two mirna genes are clustered in a region of about  <dig>  <dig> bp between two annotated genes: os11g <dig> and os11g <dig>  the distance of the two mature mirnas was  <dig> bp . furthermore, there was a high degree of conservation in their surrounding regions . the highest degree of conservation occurred in their stem-loops and slightly less conservation still existed in their downstream regions . the intact stem-loops of pri-mir-169n and pri-mir169o are very large: more than  <dig> nt . due to the high conservation of their sequences, their predicted secondary structures are also highly similar . according to the previous studies  <cit> , the high conservation in such large and closed regions indicated that mir-169n and mir-169o were the result of a tandem duplication event. prior to this duplication event, the salt-inducible mirna was the original microrna . after duplication, a copy  was generated, and the original and copy formed a mirna cluster. moreover, the high level of conservation also suggested that this duplication must have been a recent event. to verify our deduction, we plotted the phylogenic tree of the mir- <dig> family stem-loops. as expected, the distance between pre-mir-169n and pre-mir-169o was much smaller than any other . in addition, the branch point of pre-mir-169n and pre-mir-169o emerged much later than others .

the cis-acting element analysis of the salt-induced micrornas
the promoters of drought- and salt-inducible genes contain two major classes of cis-acting elements, abre and dre, both of which are involved in stress-inducible gene expression  <cit> . abre and dre are the major cis-acting elements that function in aba-dependent and aba-independent gene expression respectively  <cit> .

to analyze the cis-acting elements of the mir-169n-o cluster, we should first ascertain its potential transcript start site  and promoter. as previously described, a sequence of approximately  <dig> base pairs between the upstream annotated gene and the mature sequence of mir-169n was scanned by tssp  <cit> . two potential promoters were predicted by tssp, whose tsss were approximately  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp upstream of the mir-169n . to test which was the natural promoter, we designed four pairs of primers to detect four different regions around the two promoters . the results were shown in figure 3b. only region  <dig>  could be amplified successfully from the cdna. these results indicated that the tss  <dig> bp upstream of mir-169n was the genuine one. then, the  <dig> bp upstream region of this promoter was searched for cis-acting elements. there was no dre in the sequence upstream of the mir-169n-o cluster. however, there was an abre at  <dig> bp upstream of the predicted tss of the mir-169n-o cluster . for the mir- <dig> family, mir-169g was induced by drought via the dre, an aba-independent element. however, mir-169g and mir- <dig>  were induced by high salinity through both dre and abre, where abre is an aba-dependent element . these data indicated that the mechanism of the mir- <dig> response to drought and salt was obviously different.

target genes of the salt-induced mir- <dig> genes
in arabidopsis, some ccaat-box binding transcription factors have been reported as target genes of the ath-mir- <dig> family  <cit> . to identify the target genes of osa-mir- <dig>  we performed a target gene search by running miru against the tigr rice genome mrna database   <cit> . consistent with the previous report, several nf-ya genes, a large ccaat-box binding transcription factor family conserved in all eukaryotes, were predicted to be target genes of mir- <dig> in rice . all of the predicted target sites were located not in the orf, but in 3'-utr. some of them had been recently named by thirumurugan et al   <cit> . in their recent genome-wide identification of the nf-y family,  <dig> nf-ya genes,  <dig> nf-yb genes and  <dig> nf-yc genes were identified in rice  <cit> . nf-ya is one of the subunits of the nf-y complex, which bind to the ccaat-box promoter to regulate the expression of numerous genes. to investigate whether these ny-ya genes were in fact regulated by mir- <dig>  we further quantified the mrna levels of some predicted genes after high salinity treatment. the primers spanning the target site were designed for rt-pcr. two amplicons from os03g <dig> and os07g <dig> respectively showed rapid down-regulation after high salinity treatment. the down-regulation of os03g <dig> was more significant and rapid than that of os07g <dig>  however, the mrnas seemed to quickly escape from cleavage and turned to normal level  <dig> hours after treatment despite the fact that the mirnas were still induced. other nf-ya genes had no obvious changes on mrna levels . real-time pcr assay showed similar results . to further confirm this point, the total rnas from samples at  <dig>  hours,  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours were pooled and used for mapping the cleavage site by 5'-race assay. as shown in figure 4c, two expected bands from os03g <dig> were observed by using two os03g <dig> specific primers. the prior sequencing showed that the two bands were the mixtures representing the right cleavage site and some degradation products with the 5' end downstream of the mirna cleavage site. those clones with the longest insertions were further sequenced and the results were summarized in figure 4d. however, we failed to amplify any bands from os07g <dig>  in all, our data confirmed that os03g <dig> , an nf-ya gene, was transiently cleaved by mir- <dig> after salt treatment in rice.

the response of the mir- <dig> family to high salinity in arabidopsis
to determine whether the response of the mir- <dig> family to high salinity also occurs in other plants, we treated arabidopsis seedling with high salinity. treatment persisted for  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours, as described in the methods section. because the sequences of the ath-mir- <dig> family are very similar, only one probe was used for northern blot. thus, the detected signal was the sum signal from all the mir- <dig> members. as in rice, the probe to the ath-mir- <dig> family detected a similar induced signal . this indicated that at least one member of the ath-mir- <dig> family was induced significantly by high salinity. however, a slight difference between rice and arabidopsis was observed. in rice, the significant induction was observed immediately after  <dig> hours of treatment, while in arabidopsis, induction was observed until after  <dig> hours of treatment . this may be attributed to the biological differences among plant species. of course, the conditions of the plants' culture and treatment could also be one of the causes. these results suggested that the induction of some mir- <dig> members by abiotic stress was a common phenomenon in plants.

discussion
drought and salinity are becoming particularly widespread in many regions and are the primary cause of crop loss worldwide. many genes that are induced by these stresses have been identified  <cit> . however, little is known about the relation between the mirna and these stresses  <cit> . our studies have shown that some mir- <dig> members were induced by these stresses in rice and arabidopsis. interestingly, it seemed that only a minority of members of the large mir- <dig> family responded to these stresses. furthermore, these inducible micrornas displayed specificity to different stresses.

plant microrna families are usually much larger than those of animals. mir- <dig> is one of the largest families of mirnas in plants. to date, the rice mir- <dig> family contains  <dig> members in the microrna registry  <dig>   <cit> . these members have very similar or the same mature sequences and almost the same predicted target genes. however, their expression profiles were very different . noticeably, mir-169g and mir-169n  exhibited identical responses to high salinity, but different responses to drought. from our studies, we speculated that mir- <dig> could be a mirna family that responds to various stress conditions. in our study, the stress condition was more moderate than those of some other groups  <cit> . for this reason, we thus could not exclude that other members of mir- <dig> could be induced by more intense salt stress condition.

at least five signal transduction pathways exist in drought and high salinity stress responses: three are aba dependent and two are aba independent  <cit> . in the aba-dependent pathways, abre functions as a major aba-responsive element. dre is a major responsive element in the aba-independent pathway. in this study, high salinity induced both mir-169g and mir-169n  which contain dre and abre respectively. in our previous study  <cit> , only drought had induced mir-169g, which contains dres. peg treatment only mimics osmotic stress, while salt treatment also brings ionic toxicity except for osmotic stress to plants. from this point, we concluded that mir-169g could have been induced by osmotic stress, while mir-169n and mir-169o were induced by ionic stress. the difference of the cis-acting regulative elements on mir-169g and mir-169n  could be part of the molecular base of their diverse responses to stresses.

in addition, we searched the target genes of the mir <dig> family in silica, and genes of nf-ya family were predicted as its target genes. our subsequent data validated that two of the predicted target genes were down-regulated as the members of the mir- <dig> were induced by high salinity. nf-ya is one of the subunits of nf-y complex, which was isolated as a ccaat-box binding complex and is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor  <cit> . the ccaat box is one of the most common elements in eukaryotic promoters and is present in 30% of all eukaryotic genes. a study in triticum aestivum revealed that nine subunits of the nf-y complex were responsive to drought  <cit> . tanf-ya <dig> mrna levels showed a significant reduction in drought-affected leaves to around one-third of that seen in leaves of the non-stressed control. a similar level of down-regulation in the drought-stressed leaves was seen for four tanf-yb genes  and three tanf-yc genes . only tanf-yb <dig> was up-regulated under drought condition  <cit> . that so many nf-y subunits were down-regulated by drought indicated the expression of many genes controlled by nf-y complexes were turned off as a result and also that nf-y complexes should play quite important and comprehensive roles in plant adaptation to drought.

the mrna levels of os03g <dig> and os07g <dig> declined immediately after high salinity treatment, according to the induction of mir- <dig> in rice. however, rapid compensation was observed at  <dig> hours after treatment despite the fact that the mirnas were still being induced. our data partially explained the mrnas reduction of some nf-y subunits as observed by stephenson et al  <cit> . the transient inhibition suggested some mechanisms help the ny-ya gene to escape from cleavage by mir- <dig> after long-time treatment of high salinity. given that the nf-y complex potentially regulates so many genes, we speculated that the roles of mir-169g, mir-169n and mir-169o under salt-stress in rice could be involved in comprehensive physiological processes. therefore, we thought that these mirnas are one of the crucial molecules at an upstream node in transcriptional regulatory networks of salt stress signal transduction. in recent years, although both large numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated genes were identified  <cit> , most intention has been focused on genes that were induced in plant under abiotic stresses such as drought and high salinity. the down-regulation of many genes should be also very important for plants to tolerate the environmental stresses, while little is known about that how and why these genes are down-regulated. our data suggested that the salt-inducible members of the mir- <dig> family could be pivotal molecules in inhibiting these down-regulated genes under abiotic stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified that mir-169g and mir-169n were induced by high salinity. we analyzed the gene organization and conservation of the mir-169n and mir-169o. the high level of conservation suggested that these two mirnas derived from a tandem duplication event. the promoter searching revealed that there were abre elements in the sequence upstream of the mir-169n-o cluster and suggested that mir-169n, o may be regulated by aba-dependent pathway. we further identified os03g <dig>  as a target gene of mir- <dig> by 5'-race. in arabidopsis, at least one member of the ath-mir- <dig> family was induced significantly by high salinity.
