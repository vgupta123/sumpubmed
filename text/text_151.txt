BACKGROUND
mycoplasma suis belongs to a group of highly specialized uncultivable hemotrophic bacteria within the family mycoplasmataceae that attach to the surface of host erythrocytes  <cit> . in the last few years reports on hemotrophic mycoplasmas in various animal species  <cit>  as well as in humans  <cit>  continuously increased. obviously, hemotrophic mycoplasmas are emerging agents with a zoonotic potential. m. suis causes infectious anemia in pigs leading to serious economic loss in the pig industry due to acute anemia as well as chronic persistent infections with increased susceptibility to respiratory and enteric diseases  <cit> .

instead of a clear and long-dated clinical significance of hemotrophic mycoplasmas  <cit>  our knowledge on the physiology and metabolism of hemotrophic mycoplasmas is rather limited. this can primarily led back to their unculturability and the lack of sequence data  <cit> . probably, m. suis can use glucose as a source of carbon and energy  <cit> . however, detailed energy requirements of m. suis are largely unknown and its key enzymes have not been described so far. in previous studies we successfully screened genome libraries to identify m. suis proteins which are involved in pathogenetic processes of m. suis infections  and the energy metabolism of these rather unexplored pathogens  <cit> . in this paper we identified the soluble inorganic pyrophoshatase  of m. suis by applying said strategy. inorganic pyrophosphate  is an important by-product of many biosynthetic processes, and sppases which hydrolyze ppi to inorganic phosphate , are essential and ubiquitous metal-dependent enzymes providing a thermodynamic pull for many biosynthetic reactions  <cit> . soluble ppases belong to two non-homologous families: family i, widespread in all types of organisms  <cit> , and family ii, so far confined to a limited number of bacteria and archaea  <cit> . the families differ in many functional properties; for example, mg2+ is the preferred cofactor for family i sppases studied, whereas mn2+ confers maximal activity to family ii sppases  <cit> . detailed aims of this study were the recombinant production and characterization of the m. suis sppase and the comparison of its properties to those of other bacteria. characterization of essential enzymes in the metabolism of hemotrophic mycoplasmas are important steps towards the establishment of an in vitro cultivation system for this group of hitherto uncultivable hemotrophic bacteria.

RESULTS
identification of the m. suis inorganic pyrophosphatase 
the sppase of m. suis was identified by screening of genomic libraries of m. suis using shot gun sequencing. by means of sequence analysis and database alignments of  <dig> randomly selected library clones we identified library clone ms <dig> containing an m. suis insert with highest identity to the gene encoding the m. penetrans sppase. since prokaryotic sppases are known to be essential in energy metabolism  <cit>  we selected the ms <dig> clone for further studies. to confirm the m. suis authenticity of ms <dig> southern blot analyses of m. suis genomic dna were performed using two ecori ms <dig> library fragments as probes. the ms <dig> ecori fragments hybridized with two genomic m. suis fragments of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively . detailed sequence analysis revealed that the clone ms <dig> contains a 2059-bp insert with an average g+c content of  <dig> %. clone ms <dig> includes two orfs : orf <dig> showed the highest identity with u. parvum thioredoxin trx . orf <dig> with a length of  <dig> bp encodes a 164-aa protein with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig> . the orf <dig> matched best with m. penetrans ppa . the overall degrees of identity to the ppa of u. urealyticum, m. mycoides ssp mycoides, and m. capricolum ssp capricolum were calculated to be  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. figure  <dig> shows an alignment of sppases of selected mycoplasma species. the characteristic signature of sppase which is essential for the binding of cations was identified at amino acid positions  <dig> to  <dig>  using the program predict protein http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/. possible signatures for sppases are ddd. the signature of the m. suis sppase was determined as dgdpldv . the  <dig> conserved residues which build the active site of sppases could be identified in the m. suis sppase, too .

expression of recombinant ppase in e. coli
the entire orf of the m. suis ppa was assembled as a synthetic gene and one ugatrp codon at position 274- <dig> was replaced by ugg. other changes in the synthetic ppa were done to optimize the sequence for the heterologous e. coli expression. induction of e. coli transformants containing the ppa gene resulted in the high-level expression of a  <dig> kda-protein as shown in figure 3a. recombinant ppase was used to raise a ppase-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum. the specificity of the rabbit serum was demonstrated by probing an immunoblot containing purified rppase and a m. suis preparation. the anti-ppase serum reacted clearly with a single band of  <dig> kda corresponding to the purified rppase. in the m. suis preparations a weak band of  <dig> kda and a clear band of  <dig> kda potentially corresponding to a tetrameric form of the m. suis ppase were detected . no reaction could be observed neither with the blood control preparation of m. suis negative pigs nor the non-induced e. coli control.

characterization of ppase in m. suis
in order to prove the conserved existence of the ppase gene in m. suis,  <dig> m. suis isolates  were screened by pcr. all isolates revealed a pcr amplification product of the expected size of approximately  <dig> bp. sequence analysis of ten ppa pcr products revealed 100% sequence identity with the determined m. suis ppa sequence .

to determine the antigenicity of the ppase of m. suis we analyzed convalescent serum pools from experimentally infected pigs by immunoblotting. all convalescent serum pools reacted clearly with rppase. no reaction could be observed with sera taken from m. suis negative pigs. a representative immunoblot is shown in figure 3c.

functional characterization of recombinant m. suis ppase
the dependency of the m. suis ppase activity on the ph value was determined between ph  <dig> and  <dig> . as shown in figure 4d the optimum ph for the m. suis ppase activity was observed at ph  <dig> . at conditions below ph  <dig>  and above ph  <dig>  its activity decreased considerably.

the effect of different mg2+ concentrations on the m. suis ppase activity is shown in figure 4a. high enzyme activity was found between  <dig> and  <dig> mm mg2+ with a maximum activity at a concentration of  <dig> mm mg2+. performing the reaction at a ph of  <dig>  the maximum ppase activity was found at a concentration of  <dig> mm. using an mg2+ depleted reaction buffer the m. suis ppase-mediated ppi hydrolysis was nearly abolished. substitution of mg2+ cations with mn2+ and zn2+ resulted in significantly lower activities of  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % respectively of the mg2+ induced activity .

to further characterize the m. suis ppase the effect of inhibitors on the activity was evaluated. enzymatic activity was inhibited more than 95%, and 70% in the presence of  <dig> mm ca2+ and  <dig> mm edta, respectively .

discussion
in this study, we identified, for the first time, a gene encoding the sppase of one representative of the uncultivable hemotrophic mycoplasma group, i.e. m. suis. ppase plays an important role in the bacterial energy metabolism  <cit>  and is the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate which is formed principally as the product of many biosynthetic reactions that utilize atp. since our knowledge on the metabolism of m. suis and other hemotrophic mycoplasmas is rather limited enzymes associated with their metabolism are of our special interest.

the m. suis orf encoding the sppase showed a typically low g+c content of  <dig> % which lies within the normal range of other mycoplasmas  <cit> . the identified m. suis sppase signature sequence which is responsible for the cation binding was identical to those of m. mycoides ssp mycoides and m. capricolum ssp capricolum. furthermore, all functionally important active site residues could be identified in the m. suis sppase. interestingly, the m. suis sppase is considerably shorter than other mycoplasma sppases  due to differences in the c-terminal region. state-of-the-art knowledge on the uncultivable hemotrophic mycoplasmas does not allow for a statement as to which function the absence of amino acid residues on the c-terminus might incur. there could be a possible relevance for its subcellular localization. additionally, the ms <dig> clone harbors a second orf encoding a putative m. suis thioredoxin. the thioredoxin system operates via redox-active disulphides and provides electrons for a wide range of metabolic processes in prokaryotic cells. especially within the genus mycoplasma the thioredoxin complex apparently belongs to the metabolic core reactions  <cit> . comparison of the genome structures flanking the ppa orf with the sequenced mycoplasma species revealed no homologies .

after heterologous expression of the sppase in e. coli the protein was found in the cytoplasm with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda. in m. suis whole cell preparations the sppase was detected as a  <dig> kda band to a minor degree. predominantly the enzyme was found to have a molecular weight of approx.  <dig> kda indicating that the m. suis sppase obviously consists of four subunits. since the inference that the m. suis sppase is tetrameric is solely based on the results of an immunoblot using anti-rppase antibodies  the final proof of the tetrameric form has to be provided as soon as an in vitro cultivation of m. suis is possible. for other mycoplasmas nothing is known about the protein properties of sppase since they have only been identified via their dna sequences. however, other studies report that most eubacterial ppases are homohexamers  <cit> , and, as is unusual, sometimes homotetramers e.g. aquifex aeolicus  <cit>  or rhodospirillum rubrum  <cit> . where molecular phylogeny is concerned the mycoplasma sppases are clustered with the cyanobacteria within the prokaryotic family i ppase lineage  <cit> . the m. suis sppase showed characteristic properties in terms of cation requirement: mg2+ confers the highest efficiency in activating the m. suis sppase in a concentration-dependent manner. other cations  could replace mg2+, but the effectiveness of the latter cations was significantly lower. furthermore, ca2+ and edta inhibited the enzyme for catalysis. these results support the conclusion that the m.suis sppase belongs to the family i ppases. family i ppase has shown strong metal cation-dependency, with mg2+ conferring the highest efficiency  <cit>  and sensitivity to inhibition by ca2+  <cit> . in contrast, family ii ppase prefers mn2+ over mg2+  <cit> . the most notable characteristic of the m. suis recombinant sppase was its ph activity profile with an optimum at ph  <dig>  since  optimal ph of most bacterial sppases ranged from ph  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> , and  the physiological blood ph value of pigs is  <dig>  ±  <dig> . therefore, it is ambiguous which role the unusual ph optimum could play with regard to the pathogenesis of m. suis induced diseases. moreover, no statement is possible about optimal ph ranges for other mycoplasmal sppases since this study is the first functional characterization of a sppase of a mycoplasma species. for m. suis it is known that experimental induced acute diseases lead to severe hypoglycemia and blood acidosis with a mean ph value of  <dig>   <cit> . all these changes were considered to result from the high glucose consumption of m. suis during maximum bacteremia  <cit> . however, nothing is known about the changes in blood parameters during natural m. suis infections and especially during the chronic course of persistent infections with nearly physiological glucose metabolism. it has been reported from other infections, e.g. streptococcus pneumoniae-infections in rats that infections could lead to significantly increased blood ph values  <cit> .

notably, infected pigs showed antibodies against recombinant sppase. this may result from the sppase being an ectoenzyme which might be located on the external surface. alternatively, anti-ms ppase antibodies could be an outcome of bacterial lysis in the animal host. the first possibility is rather unlikely since no signal peptide was found in any mycoplasma ppase and all other familiy i ppases are clearly soluble and not secreted  <cit> . probably sppase could be one of the eight m. suis specific antigens which we have described recently  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
by using a screening of genomic libraries of uncultivable bacteria m. suis we were able to identify so far unknown components of the energy metabolism. we identified and characterized the inorganic pyrophosphatase of m. suis. knowing the functional characteristics of such an essential enzyme may help to establish an in vitro cultivation system for hemotrophic mycoplasmas. furthermore, as an antigenic and conserved protein m. suis sppase could in future be further analyzed as a diagnostic antigen.
