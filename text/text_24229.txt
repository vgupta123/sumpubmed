BACKGROUND
the exosome is a 3'-5' exonucleolytic multisubunit complex found in archaea and eukaryotes  <cit> . in yeast, where it was first described, the cytoplasmic exosome comprises ten subunits, whereas the nuclear exosome is formed by eleven subunits  <cit> . eight subunits show sequence similarity to exoribonucleases, and for some of them catalytic activity was demonstrated in vitro  <cit> . recent data indicate, however, that only the subunits rrp6p and rrp44p have intrinsic catalytic activity  <cit> . in yeast, depletion of individual exosome subunits leads to similar phenotypes  <cit> , indicating that only the intact complex is functional in vivo.

analyses of intra-complex interactions have provided the initial information on the yeast exosome architecture  <cit> . a working model for its structure and composition has been proposed based on mass spectrometry analyses of complexes purified under different conditions and on yeast two-hybrid interaction analyses  <cit> . according to this model, the rna binding subunits  bind to one side of the rnase ph ring, which is formed by rrp41p-rrp45p-rrp46p-rrp43p-mtr3p-rrp42p  <cit> , whereas the hydrolytic rnases  bind to the opposite side of the ring, although rrp44p, the largest exosome subunit, may also interact with rrp4p  <cit> . the crystal structure of the core human exosome has been recently determined, confirming the predictions for the structure of the eukaryotic complex  <cit> .

the archaeal exosome is composed of four different subunits, two rna binding subunits, acsl <dig> and arrp <dig>  and two subunits containing rnase ph domains, arrp <dig> and arrp <dig>  <cit> . three copies of an arrp41-arrp <dig> heterodimer form the rnase ph ring  <cit> , which associates with three molecules of arrp <dig> and/or acsl <dig>  <cit> . the rnase ph ring has three active sites, responsible for the phosphorolytic rnase activity of the complex, formed in the interface between arrp <dig> and arrp <dig>  <cit> . acsl <dig> and arrp <dig> may have a flexible structure, which allows them to interact with rna and bring it to the central pore of the rnase ph ring  <cit>  and, subsequently, to the active site. despite having three active sites, the narrow entry pore of the exosome allows the passage of only one single-stranded rna molecule  <cit> .

in eukaryotes, the exosome associates with specific protein cofactors in both cellular compartments. in the nucleus, the exosome has been shown to interact with rrp47p, mtr4p, the tramp complex, and nop53p, and in the cytoplasm, with the ski complex . rrp47p has been proposed to be a nuclear exosome cofactor required for the processing of stable rnas  <cit> . nop53p is a nucleolar protein that activates the exosome during processing of pre-rrna 7s to mature  <dig> s rrna  <cit> . mtr4p is an rna helicase and is a subunit of the tramp complex, which is involved in rna polyadenylation, directing the rna for degradation by the exosome  <cit> . the ski complex also contains a subunit with helicase activity, ski2p, and is associated with the exosome in mrna degradation  <cit> . the different protein cofactors that associate with the exosome may regulate its function.

although the archaeal exosome has been shown to associate with other proteins  <cit> , little is known about archaeal exosome cofactors or regulatory proteins. there are, however, some plausible candidates for exosome regulatory factors. among them, pasbds, a protein encoded by a gene found in the pyrococcus abyssi exosome operon, of which eukaryotic orthologues  have been shown to be involved in ribosome maturation  <cit> . panip <dig> has been shown to bind rna in vitro  <cit>  and its yeast orthologue, nip7p, is involved in rrna processing and interacts with the yeast exosome subunit rrp43p  <cit> , corroborating the hypothesis of panip <dig> being a pa-exosome cofactor. pa <dig> is a protein of unknown function, encoded by a gene found in the same operon as the rnase p subunit rrp <dig>  <cit> , and may also be involved in rna processing. in this work, we show that pasbds and panip <dig> affect the exosome activity. pasbds competes with the exosome for binding to poly-a rna, thereby slightly inhibiting its degradation by the complex. panip <dig> binds preferentially to u- and au-rich rnas, and strongly inhibits the exosome due to its association with both the exosome complex and the substrate rna. pa <dig> on the other hand, though also binding u- and au-rich rnas in vitro, does not inhibit rna degradation by the exosome. these findings indicate that panip7p and pasbds may be exosome regulatory factors. this is the first example of archaeal proteins regulating the exosome by inhibition.

RESULTS
pa-exosome complexes show different affinities for binding to oligo-rna in vitro
the archaeal exosome complex is composed of the rnase ph ring  and three molecules of the rna binding subunits arrp <dig> , or acsl <dig> , or a mixture of both. the archaeal exosome has been shown to bind poly-a rna, when incubated in the absence of phosphate  <cit> . interestingly, the rnase ph ring subcomplex  is able to bind rna by itself in the absence of the rna binding subunits  <cit> . we had previously reconstituted the pyrococcus exosome in vitro  <cit> , by assembling phrrp <dig> and phrrp <dig>  and parrp4p . in this work, the same approach was used to reconstitute the p. abyssi exosome, containing parrp <dig>  parrp <dig>  and either parrp <dig> or pacsl <dig>  we first compared the rna binding ability of the in vitro assembled p. abyssi apo-exosome, here designated as rnase ph ring, and the holo-exosomes parrp4-exosome, and pacsl4-exosome through emsa. the results show that upon addition of increasing amounts of the exosome complexes  to a poly-a rna, the free rna band decreases, while bands appear in the upper part of the gel, which correspond to rnp complexes . the parrp4-exosome binds poly-ra three-fold more efficiently than the rnase ph ring, and nine-fold more efficiently than the pacsl4-exosome . this difference in rna affinity is probably due to the presence of the two rna binding domains s <dig> and kh in parrp <dig>  and confirms our previous observation of more efficient rna binding by the pyrococcus horikoshii-abysii assembled complex  <cit> . interestingly, although pacsl <dig> contains the rna binding domains s <dig> domain and zn-ribbon, we observed a less efficient binding of the pacsl4-exosome to rna than the apo-exosome . incubation of the rnase ph ring with poly-ra resulted in the formation of an rna-protein complex , but also in some degradation of the rna . since no phosphate was added to these reactions, degradation products might be due to residual phosphate present in the protein fractions. it is unlikely that this rnase activity is due to contaminant e. coli rnases co-purified with the exosome rnase ph ring, because e. coli extracts were incubated at 80Â°c for  <dig> minutes immediately before purification of the archaeal proteins. similar residual phosphorolytic activities were reported for sulfolobus solfataricus rnase ph ring  <cit> . incubation of the parrp4-exosome with poly-ra resulted in the formation of rna-exosome complexes of different sizes, resulting in the detection of rna shifted bands and to some complexes that were retained in the gel slot . these larger complexes might result from binding of various exosome molecules to the same rna, or from protein precipitation at higher concentrations, and were not included in the quantitative analyses of the experiments . these assays were performed at least three times, with different protein preparations and probes, and here a representative experiment is shown.

although the exosome of several archaeal species have already been characterized  <cit> , little is known of the protein factors that might interact with the pa-exosome and regulate its function. in order to obtain insights into the association of the archaeal exosome with other proteins that are expected to function in rna processing, a series of experiments were performed with three candidate proteins, pasbds, panip <dig>  and pa <dig>  pasbds does not bind poly-rc, binds poly-ru with low affinity, binds  <dig> nucleotides long poly-ra, but more efficiently longer poly-ra, and binds poly-rau rnas . panip <dig>  has already been shown to bind rna in vitro with higher affinity for u-rich rnas  <cit> , and here we show that panip <dig> also binds a poly-au rna  that contains complementary sequence and can form both intra- and inter-strand base-pairs. similar to panip <dig> and pasbds, pa <dig> binds poly-au rna very efficiently, but differently from panip <dig> and pasbds, it does not bind to any of the rna homopolymers tested .

effects of p. abyssi proteins on the exosome-rna interaction
consistent with the results described above, parallel emsa with pa <dig>  panip <dig> and pasbds and a poly-ra substrate showed that a band shift can be detected only for pasbds . incubation of the exosome complexes with rna in the presence of these proteins revealed their effect on the exosome rna binding activity. as shown here, although pa <dig> does not bind poly-ra, it inhibits  <dig> -fold poly-ra binding by rnase ph ring and  <dig> -fold binding by pacsl4-exosome . however, pa <dig> does not show a pronounced effect on the parrp4-exosome binding to poly-ra . since the exosome has a much higher affinity for binding to poly-ra than panip <dig>  in a direct competition assay the exosome was expected to prevail over panip <dig> for poly-ra binding. instead, the results show a strong decrease in the intensity of the bands shifted by the exosome in the presence of panip <dig> . panip <dig> caused a three-fold decrease in poly-ra binding by the rnase ph ring, a 40-fold decrease in binding by the parrp4-exosome, and a 20-fold decrease in binding by the pacsl4-exosome. this result indicates that the decrease in the exosome binding to poly-ra caused by panip <dig> may be due to a direct interaction between panip <dig> and the exosome and not to direct competition for binding to poly-ra.

pasbds, on the other hand, binds poly-ra, and was expected to compete with the exosome for binding to this rna. when pasbds and the exosome complexes are incubated with poly-ra, the band corresponding to the free rna decreases in intensity and bands corresponding to pasbds-rna and exosome-rna become visible . poly-ra binding by parrp4-exosome was little affected by the presence of pasbds, indicating that parrp4-exosome has higher affinity for poly-ra than pasbds . the observation that pasbds-rna complex results in a smear, instead of a well defined band, also indicates a low stability complex. surprisingly, however, rnase ph ring and pacsl4-exosome bound poly-ra more efficiently upon addition of pasbds . in summary, pasbds binds poly-ra and increases rna binding by the rnase ph ring and the pacsl4-exosome, but does not strongly affect the parrp4-exosome. pa <dig> and panip <dig>  do not bind poly-ra with high affinity, but affect the exosome. pa <dig> affects rna binding by the exosome complexes with lower rna affinity, rnase ph ring and pacsl4-exosome, while not affecting the parrp4-exosome, which has higher affinity for rna. panip <dig> inhibits all the exosome complexes, and more strongly parrp4-exosome and pacsl4-exosome.

panip <dig> and pasbds interfere with exosome rna degradation
the archaeal exosome has been shown to degrade rna in vitro  <cit> , and based on the effect of panip <dig>  pasbds, or pa <dig> on the exosome rna binding, we decided to investigate whether the rnase activity of the complex was also influenced by these proteins. rna degradation assays were performed in the presence of tris- <dig> buffer and  <dig> mm nah2po <dig> . upon addition of  <dig> pmol pa <dig> to the reaction, little effect was detected on the degradation of a 14-nucleotide poly-ra substrate by rnase ph ring and pacsl4-exosome, and higher inhibition was detected on parrp4-exosome .  <dig> pmol panip <dig>  on the other hand, inhibited the rnase activity of all complexes, showing a stronger inhibitory effect on the holo-exosome complexes, parrp4-exosome and pacsl4-exosome  . addition of  <dig> pmol pasbds inhibited the rnase activity of the rnase ph ring and parrp4-exosome up to eight-fold , but showed little effect on the pacsl4-exosome .

since panip <dig> showed the highest inhibitory effect on the exosome poly-ra degradation activity, we decided to analyze the exosome function in the presence of panip <dig> towards a poly-rau oligo substrate that can form intra- and inter-strands base pairs, and to which panip <dig> showed high affinity for binding . for this purpose, rnase protection assays were performed in the presence of  <dig> mm nah2po <dig>  and samples were subjected to electrophoresis in native polyacrylamide gels. under these conditions, it was possible to analyze both binding of the proteins to the poly-au rna, as well as rna degradation by the exosome. in this experiment, we first incubated the poly-rau with either buffer or panip <dig> for  <dig> minutes, after which time the exosome complexes and  <dig> mm nah2po <dig> were added and the reactions were further incubated for  <dig> minutes. the three exosome complexes bound efficiently to the poly-rau although this rna can form base pairs of low stability. the bands of the free rna probe are only visible in the reactions containing low amounts of the exosome complexes , indicating that the probe is bound and consequently degraded by the exosome. this finding indicates that all exosome complexes can degrade low stability double-stranded rnas. despite the ability of the exosome complexes to degrade the poly-rau oligo, it was not as effective as the poly-ra degradation .

in the absence of panip <dig>  upon addition of increasing amounts of the rnase ph ring, the free rna band decreases in intensity, while the bands of the rna-protein complexes, and of the degradation product increase . when incubated with rna in the presence of panip <dig>  the rnase ph ring seems to degrade only the free rna, and not the molecules bound to panip <dig>  since the free rna band decreases in intensity while the band corresponding to the degradation product increases, and the panip7-rna band remains mostly unchanged . in the cases of parrp4- and pacsl4-exosome, due to the presence of the rna binding subunits, the holo-exosome complexes bind the rna more efficiently than the rnase ph ring . upon incubation of parrp4- and pacsl4-exosome with poly-rau bound to panip <dig>  the free rna band decreases in intensity while exosome-rna complexes are detected and the band of degradation products becomes visible . it is interesting to note that in all cases, much less rna is degraded in the presence of panip <dig> .

although the rnase ph ring is a hexameric complex, whereas panip <dig> is a monomeric protein, the bands formed in the presence of rnase ph ring and panip <dig> run as complexes of approximately the same size. one hypothesis to explain this observation is that it is possible that more than one molecule of panip <dig> bind the same rna, thereby forming larger rnp complexes. we ruled out the possibility that some of the parrp <dig> and parrp <dig> molecules might not be associated in the form of the rnase ph ring and bound rna in their monomeric forms because the parrp41-parrp <dig> complex was purified by using size exclusion chromatography, selecting for complexes corresponding to the rnase ph ring size . furthermore, this complex is active for rna degradation, confirming that the rnase ph ring was reconstituted in vitro.

pa-exosome inhibition by panip <dig> depends on its ability to bind rna
panip <dig> shows strong inhibitory effect on exosome degradation of poly-rau, indicating that inhibition depends, at least partially on the panip <dig> ability to bind rna. in order to test this possibility, poly-au rna degradation assays were performed in the presence of panip <dig> mutants  <cit> . the rnase ph ring degrades poly-rau, but not very efficiently , whereas as the parrp4-exosome degrades only a few nucleotides of the poly-rau substrate . the pacsl4-exosome, on the other hand, degrades completely the poly-rau substrate . these results are consistent with the more stable binding of parrp4-exosome to rna and with the formation of a more constricted rna entry pore in this exosome complex that does not allow double-stranded rna molecules to be degraded. in the presence of wild type panip <dig>  poly-rau degradation was strongly inhibited . interestingly, panip7r151a, r152a  does not inhibit rna degradation by the exosome . accordingly, the mutant panip7k155a, k158a, which binds rna with low affinity  <cit> , causes an intermediate inhibition . these results confirm that in the case of poly-rau, inhibition of exosome function depends on panip <dig> ability to interact with the substrate rna. an additional control to these experiments was performed, in which the effect of pa <dig> on the rnase activity of the exosome was analyzed. similar to panip <dig>  pa <dig> binds au-rich rnas , but contrary to panip <dig>  pa <dig> does not inhibit the rnase activity of the exosome , confirming the specificity of the panip <dig> effect.

panip <dig> affects the exosome rna polymerase activity
the effect of panip <dig> on the exosome rna polymerization activity was also analyzed. wild type panip <dig> strongly inhibited rna polyadenylation by the exosome , when compared to the panip <dig> mutants panip7k155a, k158a and panip7r151a, r152a . these results further confirm that panip <dig> inhibition of the exosome activity requires an intact panip <dig>  able to bind rna. pasbds and pa <dig> did not affect rna polyadenylation by the exosome complexes , corroborating the conclusion of the specificity of the exosome inhibition by panip <dig> 

direct interaction between panip <dig> and pa-exosome
the mechanism of exosome inhibition by panip <dig> could involve competition for rna binding. this could be the case in situations where the exosome and panip <dig> are incubated with au-rich substrates since panip <dig> binds this type of rna. however, panip <dig> inhibits the exosome also when the substrate is a poly-ra. attempts to detect the interaction between panip <dig> and pa-exosome through co-purification of the complexes using gel-filtration assays and protein pull-down experiments have failed . this raised the hypothesis that panip <dig> might have low affinity for the pa-exosome, or the interaction panip7-exosome is transient. in order to determine whether panip <dig> could interact directly with the pa-exosome, panip <dig> was labeled with fitc  and incubated with the exosome complexes for  <dig> minutes at 25Â°c. the resulting complexes were initially subjected to electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels followed by analysis of the fluorescence signal on an image plate reader. the results from these assays show that panip <dig> binds to the holo-exosome complexes, with a higher affinity for the pacsl4-exosome than for the parrp4-exosome . these data corroborate the stronger inhibitory effect of panip <dig> upon pacsl4-exosome described above.

fitc-labeled panip <dig> incubated with the exosome complexes as described above was also analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. the analysis of fluorescence emission from the isolated proteins show that most panip <dig> is eluted in fractions corresponding to proteins of about  <dig> kda, while the exosome complexes do not show fluorescence emission at  <dig> nm . when the exosome complexes are incubated with fitc-labeled panip <dig>  however, fluorescence in the position corresponding to the exosome-panip <dig> complexes can be detected . the signal is stronger for pacsl4-exosome + panip <dig>  indicating a more stable interaction between these proteins. these results further confirm that panip <dig> inhibits the exosome by associating with both the complex and the substrate rna.

discussion
the archaeal exosome has been shown to bind, degrade and polyadenylate rna in vitro  <cit> . recently, the s. solfataricus exosome activities were analyzed in vitro with respect to the different subunit composition, mg2+ concentration, and the efficiency of polymerization and degradation of rna, which depend on the concentration of free phosphate or nucleotide diphosphates  <cit> . we have previously compared the rna binding abilities between the pyrococcus horikoshii apo-exosome rnase ph ring and the p. horikoshii-abysii rrp4-exosome complex  <cit> . here we extended the comparison of the rna binding abilities, and rna degradation and polymerization activities of three different p. abyssi exosome complexes, rnase ph ring, parrp4-exosome and pacsl4-exosome. furthermore, since very little is known of the possible archaeal exosome regulatory factors, here we analyzed the effects of three proteins on the exosome activities when degrading different substrates.

the nine-subunit parrp4-exosome binds rna with higher affinity but degrades rna less efficiently than pacsl4-exosome. these different characteristics could be explained by parrp <dig> having higher affinity for rna than pacsl <dig>  due to the presence of one s <dig> and one kh domain in parrp <dig>  instead of one s <dig> and one zinc-ribbon domain in pacsl <dig>  <cit> . consequently, depending on the rna binding subunit present in the complex, the structure of the exosome rna entry pore may undergo conformational changes  <cit> , leading to the different rna binding affinities of the exosome complexes and the slower rna degradation by the parrp4-exosome. although the archaeal exosome binds the substrate rna directly, it may also interact with various protein factors that are important for directing the complex to the substrate, for opening rna secondary structures, and possibly for regulating its function.

the bacterial pnpase, which is structurally and functionally related to the exosome, is part of the degradosome, a protein complex involved in rrna and trna processing and in mrna degradation that is formed by pnpase, rnase e, the helicase rhlb, and enolase . in eukaryotes, exosome co-factors include the helicase mtr4p, the tramp complex, nop53p, dob1p, rrp47p, npl3p, lsm proteins, the ski complex, and the nrd1p/nab3p complex  <cit> . yeast nip7p has been shown to interact with the exosome subunit rrp43p  <cit> . conditional depletion of yeast nip7p leads to the accumulation of pre-rrna 27s, a precursor of  <dig> s and 25s rrnas  <cit> . nip7p interacts with rna in vitro and with several proteins known to associate with the pre-rrna 27s  <cit> . the yeast and archaeal orthologues of nip <dig> contain a pua domain, which has been previously demonstrated to be involved in rna interaction  <cit> . accordingly, nip7p and panip <dig> bind rna in vitro, with higher affinity for poly-u rnas  <cit> . here we show that panip <dig> also has high affinity for poly-au rnas that can form weak secondary structures. panip <dig> strongly inhibits the archaeal exosome, and this inhibition depends on panip <dig> ability to bind rna and to interact with the exosome complex. supporting this conclusion, panip <dig> mutants that do not bind rna, have smaller inhibitory effects on the exosome. it is possible that panip <dig> binds rna through its c-terminal pua domain, and interacts with the archaeal exosome via its n-terminal domain, thereby controlling the exosome function. the hypothesis that the inhibition of the exosome by panip <dig> involves both rna binding and protein interaction is further strengthened by the observations that panip <dig> also inhibits the degradation of rnas for which panip <dig> has low affinity, such as poly-ra. interestingly, panip <dig> has stronger inhibitory effect on pacsl4-exosome, indicating a possible role for panip <dig> as a regulatory factor for one of the exosome complexes. panip <dig> could interact with pacsl <dig> zn-ribbon domain, which may be involved in the interaction with proteins, providing a mechanism for the exosome regulation.

pa <dig> was shown here to bind poly-rau rna but contrary to panip <dig> does not strongly affect the exosome rnase activity, although pa <dig> inhibits rna binding by the rnase ph ring and pacsl4-exosome complexes. the p. horikoshii rnase p is formed by the rna component and five proteins, including rrp <dig>  <cit> . since pa <dig> is encoded by a gene found in the same operon as the rnase p subunit rrp <dig>  <cit> , it is possible that pa <dig> regulates rnase p function in vivo.

although eukaryotic sbds/sdo1p has not been shown to interact with the exosome, it has been shown to be required for pre-rrna processing, for 60s ribosomal subunit translational activation and tif6p recycling  <cit> . in addition, sbds has been shown to interact with the human orthologue of nip7p and its deficiency affects expression of different genes  <cit> . yeast sdo1p has recently been shown to interact with nip7p and to bind poly-a and poly-au rna  <cit> . the pasbds gene is found in the same operon as three of the exosome subunits, indicating that it is also involved in rna metabolism.

structural analysis of archeoglobus fulgidus sbds has shown that this protein contains an rna binding domain  <cit> . in this work, we confirmed the hypothesis of pasbds binding to rna, by showing that it binds poly-ra, poly-ru and poly-rau in vitro in a length-dependent manner, and competes with the parrp4-exosome for binding to a-rich rnas. these results indicate that pasbds is also involved in rna processing and may regulate one of the archaeal exosome complexes in vivo. further indication of exosome regulation was obtained in rna degradation assays, in which the rnase activity of the rnase ph ring and of the parrp4-exosome was slightly inhibited by pasbds. it is therefore possible that pasbds interacts with rna in vivo and controls its processing by the exosome.

CONCLUSIONS
we show in this work that two archaeal proteins that bind rna can affect the pa-exosome activity, making them candidates to be exosome regulatory factors. pasbds binds a- and au-rich rnas and inhibits mainly the parrp4-exosome. panip <dig> binds preferably au-rich rnas and strongly inhibits pacsl4-exosome. furthermore, similar to the eukaryotic counterparts, panip <dig> interacts with the pa-exosome. based on the results shown here that pasbds and panip <dig> inhibit preferentially specific exosome complexes, it is possible that these proteins control the pa-exosome in vivo. the evolutionary conserved structures and rna affinities of nip <dig> and sbds raise the hypothesis that their eukaryotic orthologues also control the exosome function.
