BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of endogenous non-coding rnas with lengths of 20– <dig> nucleotide  and function as gene expression regulators  <cit> . to date,  <dig>  conserved and species-specific mirnas from  <dig> species have been deposited in mirbase  <dig> . plant mirnas were first reported in arabidopsis thaliana in  <dig>  and subsequently identified in a large number of plant species. plant mirnas originate from single-stranded primary transcripts , which display stem-loop structures, via the cleavage of a short duplex from the stem region by dcl <dig>  <cit> . increasing evidence demonstrates that mirnas play important roles in multiple biological processes, including growth, development, and stress responses , by translation inhibition or by cleaving their specific mrna targets  <cit> . extensive studies have been performed to understand the functions of mirnas in various species during the past decade . the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies has provided a highly efficient means to explore large mirna families. these sequencing technologies have been successfully used in various species to identify and characterize a large number of novel mirnas due to their advantage in detecting novel mirnas with low copy number .

plant mirnas post-transcriptionally regulate target mrnas via perfect or nearly perfect complementary base pairing of the mirna. the mirnas would cleave their specific targets at the  <dig> th or 11th complementary base by effector mediated ago <dig> protein complex, which directly leads to protein translation inhibition or mrna cleavage  <cit> . selection and annotation of mirna targets are essential steps to understand the biological function of mirnas. prediction of mirna target genes can be performed using several methods, such as computational target prediction, ago protein co-immunoprecipitation, and rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cdna ends   <cit> . with recent advances on sequencing technologies, degradome analysis combined with high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis has been proved to be an efficient approach for mirna target prediction. degradome sequencing has been successfully applied in arabidopsis, rice, and other plant species .

evidence has suggested that mirnas are involved in several regulatory pathways that control reproductive development in plants. for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig> affect flowering time when over-expressed in arabidopsis and maize . mir <dig> regulates flower development by targeting apetala <dig>  and ap <dig> homologs in arabidopsis  <cit> . recent studies have reported the potential role of mirnas in sex determination. in maize, the translation of ids <dig> can be inhibited by ts <dig> mirna , resulting in male florets; by contrast, a loss-of-function mutation in the ts <dig> or a mutation in the mirna-binding site of the ids <dig> gene would produce normal ids <dig> protein, thus resulting in female florets  <cit> . mirnas are likely to be important in sex determination and differentiation in dioecious species  <cit> . nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the mechanism through which mirnas control plant sex determination has not been elucidated. although numerous sex chromosome-specific mirnas have been identified in some dioecious species  <cit> , the detailed functions of these mirnas remain unclear.

garden asparagus  is widely cultivated as a valuable vegetable crop worldwide because of its important nutritional and medicinal value attributed to its abundant amounts of flavonoids, saponins, and several vitamins. previous works have shown that asparagus exhibits antioxidant, anti-cancer, and immunity promoting properties  <cit> . asparagus is a dioecious species that belongs to liliaceae family. the sex of garden asparagus is determined by its sex chromosomes; the males are heterogametic , whereas the females are homogametic   <cit> . garden asparagus is a diploid species containing  <dig> chromosomes; of which, the chromosome l <dig> has been identified as its sex chromosome  <cit> . unlike other dioecious plants, such as white campion  and marchantia polymorpha, asparagus contains homomorphic sex chromosomes. the primitive y chromosome of asparagus only diverge from their homomorphic x chromosome in a short male-specific and non-recombining region; asparagus is currently regarded as a model plant for studying the evolution of sex chromosomes, considering that its sex chromosomes originated approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . however, genomic information of asparagus remains limited. approximately  <dig>  est sequences for asparagus are currently available in the ncbi databases and a transcriptome dataset generated by high-throughput sequencing technology was recently published  <cit> . to date, information regarding asparagus mirnas or even the liliaceae family is insufficient, and only a few mirnas have been described in detail. in the present study, we constructed two small rna  libraries of male and female asparagus and performed high-throughput illumina sequencing to identify conserved and asparagus-specific mirnas. differentially expressed mirnas between male and female plants were identified and further verified by real-time quantitative rt-pcr . furthermore, potential targets for all asparagus mirnas were predicted through degradome sequencing. gene ontology  analysis indicated that several predicted targets of asparagus mirnas are associated with organ development, substance metabolism, signal transduction, and stress responses. interestingly, several mirnas are known to be involved in plant reproductive organ development; hence, mirnas exhibit important roles in sex determination and differentiation.

RESULTS
small rna profiles in a. officinalis
two independent srna libraries were generated from the pooled total rnas from female and male asparagus individuals. these libraries were sequenced with the high-throughput illumina hiseq platform to identify mirnas from asparagus. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from the female and male rna libraries, respectively. after trimming the adapter sequences and removing low quality and short sequences ,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads were retained for the female and male flowers, respectively. the sequences belonging to rrnas, trnas, anrna, and snornas were further filtered according to the rfam database . the remaining  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads, which represent  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unique reads, were used for mirna identification from female and male individuals, respectively .table  <dig> statistics of high-throughput sequencing reads



in both libraries, the majority of the unique srna reads were 20–24 nt in length . the most abundant srnas in the libraries were 24-nt rnas, followed by 21-nt rnas . the portion of 24-nt srnas was approximately  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in male and female plants, respectively, and the portion of 21-nt srnas was approximately  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %. these results are consistent with the typical size distribution of srnas reported in other plant species, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , oryza sativa  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit> , and citrus trifoliata  <cit> ; in these species, 24-nt srnas are the most abundant and diverse class of small non-coding rnas  sequenced in the srna libraries.fig.  <dig> length distribution of unique srnas in male and female libraries of a. officinalis. most of the generated reads were  <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides long



identification of conserved mirnas in a. officinalis
eligible srnas were mapped with mirbase  <dig>  to identify conserved mirnas from all our data sets. after the blastn search and further sequence analysis,  <dig> non-redundant mirnas were identified to have high sequence similarity to known mirnas . these mirnas could be classified into  <dig> mirna families. among the identified families, the mir <dig> family contained the largest number of members , followed by mir <dig> and mir <dig> families, with  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. by contrast, the mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> families had only one member each . nucleotide sequence analysis of these mirnas revealed that uridine  is the most common nucleotide at the 5′ end ; the 10th nucleotide matched to the cleavage site of the targets and was mainly adenine . however, the majority of the nucleotides at position  <dig>  another common cleavage site, was a or cytosine  .fig.  <dig> number of identified mirnas in each conserved mirna family in a. officinalis


fig.  <dig> relative nucleotide bias at each mirna position compared with the total rna. uridine  was the most common nucleotide at the 5′ end , and the 10th nucleotides, which match to the cleavage site of targets, were mainly adenine  



the majority of the conserved mirnas were 21-nt in length , thereby representing the most abundant class of mirnas in plants. the next represented class was the 20-nt mirnas, which included  <dig>  % of all the identified mirnas . the mirna length distribution is consistent with previously reported values for other plants  <cit> . among the  <dig> mirna families,  <dig> were found to be highly conserved among different plant species; these families include mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  specifically, mir166b- <dig>  mir167a, mir171f, and mir396a-5p were highly conserved in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> species in mirbase . some known but less-conserved mirnas were also found in asparagus. interestingly, most asparagus mirnas have been identified mainly in monocot plants. for example, mir <dig>  mir166k, and mir166e were previously identified in o. sativa, whereas mir396a was found in zea mays.

only aof-mir172a, aof-mir535a, aof-mir535b, aof-mir160b, aof-mir160d, and aof-mir <dig> mirnas matched to the respective pre-mirnas from the asparagus unigenes because of limited asparagus genome information . to further verify the identified mirnas, we used the genome sequences of o. sativa, a model monocot plant, as the reference for the identification of the precursors of the potential mirnas. finally, the pre-mirna sequences of  <dig> mirnas were identified based on the o. sativa genome sequences .

the relative abundance of asparagus mirnas were estimated as transcripts per million . the tpm values drastically varied among  <dig> mirna families. some mirnas were highly expressed in both male and female plants, which accumulated at more than  <dig> tpm. these mirnas include aof-mir159a, aof-mir164b, aof-mir166d- <dig>  aof-mir166g-3p, aof-mir166h-3p, aof-mir167h, aof-mir396b- <dig>  aof-mir396b- <dig>  and aof-mir535b. however, some mirnas were expressed at lower levels in asparagus plants . different conserved mirnas, even those in the same family, exhibited different expression levels. for example, aof-mir166d- <dig> mirna presented the highest abundance level, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  tpm in the female and male libraries, respectively. however, some mir <dig> members showed relatively lower expression levels. the lowest levels were observed for aof-mir166a- <dig>  aof-mir166i- <dig>  aof-mir166e- <dig>  and aof-mir166e- <dig> . these results are consistent with the high-throughput sequencing of srnas from radish, chinese cabbage, and apricot  <cit> .

identification of novel candidate mirnas in asparagus
the remaining srna sequences were mapped with asparagus unigenes, and their hairpin structures were predicted to identify novel mirnas in asparagus. based on the annotation criteria for novel mirnas  <cit> ,  <dig> candidate mirnas with lengths between 20 nt to 24 nt were identified; of which,  <dig>  % were 21-nt long . the length of the novel mirna precursors ranged from 66 nt to 220 nt, with an average length of 161 nt . the minimum free energy  for the hairpin structures of these mirna precursors was lower than −18 kcal/mol. moreover, the minimal folding free energy index  of these candidates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average value of  <dig> , which is higher than that of other rna types, such as trnas , rrnas , and mrnas   <cit> . these results suggest that the secondary structures of these novel mirnas are stable.table  <dig> novel mirnas identified from a. officinalis

the abundance of mirnas was significantly different among the identified novel mirnas. sequencing data showed that aof-mirn <dig>  aof-mirn <dig>  and aof-mirn <dig> mirnas had relatively higher abundance in both male and female libraries; other family members demonstrated lower abundance of reads, and aof-mirn <dig> was not found in the female library. similar to previous studies  <cit> , the newly identified mirnas generally showed lower abundance levels than the conserved mirnas. these novel species-specific mirnas are considered to be young mirnas that arose recently through evolution.

the majority of these identified novel mirnas were generated from one locus, whereas seven novel mirnas including aof-mirn <dig>  aof-mirn <dig>  aof-mirn <dig>  aof-mirn <dig>  aof-mirn <dig>  aof-mirn <dig> and aof-mirn <dig> had more than one pre-mirnas . on the other hand, some unigenes could be bidirectionally transcribed. for example, the unigene un <dig> produced aof-mirn <dig>  whereas its antisense transcript was predicted to generate another mirna, namely, aof-mirn <dig>  similar findings were reported in other plants, such as soybean  <cit> , switchgrass  <cit> , and panax ginseng  <cit> . furthermore, in the present study, mirnas could be located in either the 5′-arm or 3′-arm of the stem-loop precursor. for the unigene un <dig>  aof-mirn <dig> was located in the 3′-arm; conversely, this mirna was also located in the 5′-arm of un <dig>  moreover, un <dig> and un <dig> are the precursors of aof-mirn <dig>  and originate from the 5′-arm and 3′-arm, respectively. interestingly, among novel candidates,  <dig> mirnas were predicted to be generated from un <dig>  therefore, this unigene may be required to transcribe several mirnas in asparagus.

differentially expressed mirnas between male and female plants
the normalized expression levels of mirnas were compared between male and female plants to identify sex-biased mirnas. mirnas with more than 2-fold changes in their expression levels and adjusted p <  <dig>  are presented in table  <dig>  the results showed that  <dig> conserved mirnas and seven novel candidate mirnas were differentially expressed between male and female rna libraries. among them,  <dig> mirnas were significantly up-regulated in the female library, whereas the other  <dig> mirnas were preferentially expressed in the male library. notably, aof-mirn <dig> was only expressed in male plants, thereby indicating that this novel mirna may have a specific role in male flower organ development in asparagus.table  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas between asparagus male and female plants

to confirm the expression patterns of mirnas in asparagus derived from the high-throughput sequencing,  <dig> identified mirnas were selected and subjected to qrt-pcr analysis in either plants or flowers. the results of qrt-pcr analysis were consistent with the sequencing data , except for aof-mir156k, which exhibited more than 23-fold higher expression levels in the female library than that in the male library based on sequencing data, whereas only  <dig> -fold levels were detected in female plants than that in male plants by qrt-pcr analysis. therefore, the sequence data is trustworthy and can be used for further analyses.fig.  <dig> comparison of mirna expression levels between asparagus male and female individuals through qrt-pcr. a expression levels of  <dig> selected mirnas between male and female plants. b expression profiles of aof-mir159a, aof-mir167g, aof-mir172a and aof-mir172b during male and female flower development. f- <dig> ,  <dig>  mm female flower buds; m- <dig> ,  <dig>  mm male flower buds; f- <dig>   <dig>  mm female flower; m- <dig>   <dig>  mm male flower. *or **indicates a statistically significant difference between male and female flowers at the same stage at p <  <dig>  or  <dig> , respectively



the expression profiles of differentially expressed mirnas in male and female flower buds were estimated during the early  and late  stages through qrt-pcr to evaluate the correlations between expression levels of these mirnas, including aof-mir167g, aof-mir172a, aof-mir172b, and aof-mir159a with their potential roles in sex determination or flower development. these mirnas exhibited differential expression patterns during asparagus flower development . the expression of aof-mir167g was decreased in both male and female flowers during development, with tpm of approximately 26-fold higher in  <dig>  mm female floral buds than that in 4 mm ones. by contrast, changes in male flowers were less than 2-fold. aof-mir159a exhibited opposite expression pattern, with 32-fold higher abundance in late male flowers  than that in young male floral buds . meanwhile, the expressions levels of aof-mir159a in male flowers were approximately 17-fold higher than that in female flowers at the early developmental stage. furthermore, the expression level of aof-mir160d and aof-mir396f were further estimated in  <dig>  mm, 2 mm, and 4 mm floral buds , comparison between male and female flowers showed that the expression level of aof-mir160d was higher in female flowers than that in male flowers, especially in the 2 mm floral buds, whereas the expression level of aof-mir396f showed a higher expression level in 2 mm male flower than female one, reaching to about 4-fold change.

mirna putative target prediction and annotation using degradome analysis
putative targets were predicted by high-throughput degradome sequencing to determine the function of the identified mirnas in asparagus  <cit> . the male and female samples were mixed and used to construct a degradome library. a total of ~ <dig>  million raw reads were obtained, which represent  <dig> , <dig>  unique sequences. these reads were mapped to the asparagus unigene sequences assembled from published asparagus ests  to identify potential mirna targets. a total of  <dig> , <dig>  unique sequences could be mapped to the reference asparagus unigene data. after initial processing and analyzing by cleaveland <dig> ,  <dig> target gene sequences for  <dig> conserved and seven novel mirnas were identified based on the available asparagus dataset .

relative abundance was plotted for each transcript. the sliced-target transcripts were grouped into five categories, namely, category  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  according to the relative abundance of tags at the target sites as previously reported in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and maize  <cit> . these transcripts contained more than one raw read at the position, except for category  <dig> with only one raw read  <cit> . the mirnas and corresponding targets in the four categories are shown in additional file  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  among the  <dig> identified targets,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> targets were classified into categories  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. only one target was found in category  <dig>  and no target belonged to category  <dig>  these results indicate that most of the predicted targets are efficiently cleaved by their corresponding mirnas.fig.  <dig> target plot  of representative validated asparagus mirna targets in different categories as confirmed by degradome sequencing



target prediction analysis showed that the identified targets regulated a wide range of biological processes. most of the conserved targets were transcription factor genes, such as translation initiation factor, hormone response factor, ap2-like factor, and scarecrow-like protein, which regulate plant growth and development, as well as stress responses . the mrnas of heat shock proteins , histones, transport inhibitor response proteins, dehydrogenases, kinesin-like protein, sulfite reductases and some putative uncharacterized proteins are likely to be targeted by asparagus mirnas. interestingly, several targets identified in the present study were previously reported to be involved in reproductive development in plants; these targets included myb proteins targeted by mir <dig>  <cit> , ap2-like transcription factors regulated by mirna <dig>  <cit> , and arf <dig> or arf <dig> controlled by mir <dig>  <cit> .

target analysis showed that a single mirna can simultaneously regulate several target genes, which usually belong to a large gene family. as predicted, some highly conserved mirnas such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  had multiple targets, which is consistent with previous reports in arabidopsis  <cit> . for example, the mir <dig> family can regulate several target genes such as the squamosa promoter-binding-like protein, histone h2b. <dig>  and methyltransferase . on the other hand, the majority of mirnas from the same family and even some mirnas from different families could regulate the same target genes. meanwhile, one mrna could be a potential target of several different mirnas. for example, aof-mir167a and aof-mir <dig> can regulate the expression of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. moreover, aof-mir <dig> and aof-mir <dig> had the same target sequence, namely, un <dig>  and both have been predicted to target the same est sequence for squamosa binding proteins in phaseolus vulgaris  <cit> .

although novel asparagus mirnas were sequenced at relatively lower levels compared with known mirnas, seven out of  <dig> novel mirnas were found to have candidate targets in asparagus . among these mirnas, aof-mirn <dig> and aof-mirn <dig> had only one target gene, whereas aof-mirn <dig> had three target genes, including a mediator of rna polymerase ii transcription subunit 26b. no targets were identified for the other  <dig> novel mirnas in the degradome sequencing data, which may be partly attributed to the limited genome and transcriptome information in asparagus. notably, aof-mirn <dig> and aof-mirn <dig> shared the same targets, thereby suggesting that both may belong to the same mirna family or may refer to the same mirna because of the high similarity of their nucleotide sequences.

verification of mirna-guided cleavage of target mrnas in asparagus
the psrna target  was used to predict the target unigenes of asparagus mirnas by querying specific mirna sequences against the asparagus unigene database created by transcriptome sequencing . the results were combined with degradome analysis data. ten predicted mrnas for four asparagus mirnas were selected, and their cleavage products were detected by 5′ rlm-race to verify the mirna-guided target cleavage. as shown in fig.  <dig>  all of the  <dig> predicted targets were found to contain one or two specific cleavage sites, which correspond to the complementary mirna sequences. all four tested asparagus mirnas guided target cleavage, mostly at the 10th or 11th nucleotide . in our degradome sequencing data, scarecrow-like protein  <dig>  which belongs to gras family, was predicted as the target of mir171f . consistently, four gras family transcription factors including un <dig>  un <dig>  un <dig>  and un <dig>  were also identified as targets cleaved by mir171f in the 5′ rlm-race experiment. two growth-regulating factors  were identified to be cleaved by mir396f, which is consistent with degradome sequencing data. three auxin response factors  and a transport inhibitor response protein  were also identified as the target genes of mir160d and mir393b, respectively, which is consistent with previous studies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> detection of predicted mirna target genes in asparagus by 5′ rlm-race. arrows point to the cleavage sites of targeted mrnas for four asparagus mirnas. the watson-crick pairing  and mismatch pairing  are shown in the complementary pairing area of mirna and its target. the denominator and numerator of the fraction indicate the number of sequenced monoclonal sequences and the number of monoclonal sequences with the cleavage site at the arrow, respectively. only the monoclonal sequences with the cleavage sites in the complementary pairing area of mirna/target or nearby  <dig> nucleotides were counted



go functional analysis of targets regulated by asparagus mirna
putative target genes were subjected to go analysis and mapped to the metabolic pathways from the kegg database to elucidate the mirna–target interaction and ensure the accuracy of gene annotation. only  <dig> out of  <dig> target unigenes could be mapped to the function and metabolic pathway databases; these genes were regulated by  <dig> corresponding mirnas . these target genes were also found to be involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes , cellular components, and molecular functions including transcription regulation, auxin–mediated signaling pathways, circadian rhythm, cell division, flower and seed development, metabolic processes, and defense responses. several mirnas from different families were involved in the same biological process. for instance, the mir <dig> and mir <dig> families participated in auxin mediated signaling pathways. the mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> families were associated with transcription regulation via dna-dependent mechanisms. in addition, the majority of the target genes were involved in nucleic acid and protein binding, as well as protein dimerization. furthermore, go classification demonstrated that most of the predicted proteins  were located in the nucleus. the other proteins functioned in the extracellular region, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, and golgi apparatus.table  <dig> go term analysis on different expressed mirnas between asparagus male and female plant



expression profiles of target genes for differentially expressed mirnas
qrt-pcr was used to detect the expression profiles of mirna specific targets during male and female floral development and validate the mechanism of a given mirna to regulate the expression of its target gene. the expression patterns were estimated in male and female plants, as well as in  <dig>  mm and 4 mm flowers for three unigenes, namely un <dig>  un <dig> and un <dig>  as putative target sequence of the aof-mir <dig>  aof-mir <dig> and aof-mir <dig> family, respectively . meanwhile, three targets  for aof-mir160d and three targets  for aof-mir396f were predicted from the unigene database created by rna-seq, and their expression levels were estimated in  <dig>  mm, 2 mm and 4 mm male and female flowers . a negative correlation was observed between the expression of mirnas and their targets . the targets of aof-mir160d and aof-mir396f were differentially expressed between male and female flower at one or more than one developmental stage, suggesting that aof-mir160d and aof-mir396f may participate in floral development via negatively regulating their targets. mir <dig> had significantly higher expression level in  <dig>  mm flowers than that in 4 mm flowers of male or female plants. conversely, its putative target sequence, un <dig>  was homologous with the floral homeotic protein ap <dig> in arabidopsis and expressed at a significantly lower level in  <dig>  mm flowers than that in 4 mm flowers. ap <dig> negatively regulates multiple floral organ identity genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . similarly, mir <dig> levels were lower in 4 mm flowers than those in  <dig>  mm flowers in the present study. by contrast, the target gene un <dig>  which encodes an auxin response factor  <dig> , demonstrated higher expression levels in 4 mm flowers than those in  <dig>  mm flowers. these findings indicate that mir <dig> and mir <dig> could regulate the putative targets ap <dig> and arf <dig>  respectively. the inverse relationship between mirnas and their target genes is consistent with the predicted mechanism of mirna function. however, the altered expression levels of mir <dig> and its putative target un <dig>  which encodes an eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> subunit β , followed the same trend during floral development; as such, a complex regulating regulatory mechanism exits between mirnas and their target genes  <cit> . mirnas have been proposed to upregulate their target genes upon cell cycle arrest, although the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated  <cit> .fig.  <dig> comparison of the expression levels of mirna target genes between male and female individuals through qrt-pcr. a the expression level of eif- <dig> , arf <dig>  and ap <dig> , targeted by aof-mir <dig>  aof-mir <dig> and aof-mir <dig> family, respectively, in male and female plants. *or **indicates a statistically significant difference between male and female plants at p <  <dig>  or  <dig> , respectively. b the expression level of target genes in  <dig>  mm and 4 mm female and male flower buds. f- <dig>  and f- <dig> represent  <dig>  mm and 4 mm female flower respectively; m- <dig>  and m- <dig> represent  <dig>  mm and 4 mm male flower, respectively. *or **indicates a statistically significant difference between male and female flowers at the same stage at p <  <dig>  or  <dig> , respectively



discussion
mirnas are key components of numerous cellular events in plant development and responses to various stresses. increasing evidence has indicated that plant mirnas are also involved in development and morphogenesis. with the development of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, mirnas have been identified from various plant species with or without fully sequenced genomes, including o. sativa, r. sativus, populus trichocarpa, pinus contorta, m. truncatula, c. trifoliata, panicum virgatum, and p. ginseng  <cit> . asparagus is a perennial vegetable, important in various countries because of its importance to health and economy. to date, no asparagus mirnas data have been reported in the plant mirna database. in the present study, srna libraries of male and female asparagus plants were constructed and sequenced using the illumina hiseq system, which generated 4– <dig> million clean shorter reads  per sample. from these srna sequences, a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> novel candidate mirnas were identified in garden asparagus .

previous studies predicted conserved mirnas according to their homology to known mirnas in mirbase. in the present study, homology-based predictions of conserved mirnas in asparagus were validated by precursor sequence folding and the genuine hairpin structures. some mirnas that were previously identified in a wide range of plants were also found in the present study; such mirnas include the mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> families. the mir <dig> family contained the highest number of mirna members. meanwhile, some highly conserved mirna families were sequenced with more than  <dig>  tpm; these families included the mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> families . therefore, these highly expressed mirnas may have an essential role in the regulation of asparagus growth and development. some conserved mirnas in asparagus have also been studied in detail in other plants. for example, mir <dig> in arabidopsis targets mrnas coding for the gras domain or scarecrow-like proteins, a family of transcription factors whose members have been implicated in axillary meristem formation, gibberellin and light signaling, gametogenesis, and root radial patterning . a previous study showed that mir <dig> could target mrnas coding for the tir <dig>  family in arabidopsis, which is required for auxin responses in plant development  <cit> ; mir <dig> was also strongly upregulated by cold, dehydration, and nacl treatments  <cit> .

despite the lack of complete genomic sequences, the availability of asparagus est and transcriptome sequences contributed to the identification of novel asparagus mirnas. based on the hairpin structures of pre-mirnas,  <dig> novel candidate mirnas that met the analytical criteria were identified in this study. the number of potential specific mirnas in asparagus is comparable with some plant species, such as b. oleracea   <cit> , p. ginseng   <cit> , p. vulgaris   <cit> , and strawberry   <cit> . among the novel candidate mirnas, aof-mirn <dig>  aof-mirn <dig>  and aof-mirn <dig> presented higher expression levels than the other mirnas in both male and female individuals, thereby implying their special role in asparagus growth and development. the functions of most novel candidate mirnas remain unknown because of limited asparagus genome information.

the selection and annotation of mirna targets are essential steps in the designation of mirna function in plants. degradome sequencing based on high-throughput sequencing technology has been used to identify the targets of mirnas and understand the mirna regulatory network  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> potential targets were found for  <dig> mirnas; these mirnas were grouped into four categories . the 5′ rlm-race experiment was then performed to detect and verify the cleavage products of the  <dig> predicted mrnas for four asparagus mirnas; the results showed that target cleavage often occurred at the 10th or 11th nucleotide. similar to previous reports, the targeted genes by of the test mirnas had a wide range of functions; the majority of the targets were translation and transcription factors, which are involved in growth and development processes. in the present study, arf <dig> and arf <dig> could be regulated by aof-mir <dig>  which participate in flower and fruit development in arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> . translation initiation factors could be targeted by aof-mir <dig>  which is involved in anther development  <cit>  and seed germination  <cit>  by modulating hormone signaling pathways. another transcription factor, squamosa promoter-binding-like protein  <dig>  is a predicted target of the mir <dig> family, which exhibits crucial role in root development and transition from juvenile to adult phases  <cit> . several mirna targets could encode proteins involved in responses to environmental stresses. the hsp family is one of the largest groups of proteins induced by heat shock stress; these proteins are present in almost all organisms and have significant functions in cellular homeostasis under adverse environment conditions  <cit> . in the present study, aof-mir396b- <dig> and aof-mir396c-p <dig> could regulate the expression of hsps. furthermore, the transport inhibitor response protein was found to be the target of the mir <dig> family; this protein was thought to be strongly upregulated under salt stress conditions  <cit> .

asparagus has become a model plant for investigation of early sex chromosome evolution  <cit> . the sexual dimorphism in asparagus is controlled by a region called the m locus, which is located on a pair of homomorphic sex chromosomes   <cit> . however, cloning the sex-determining region is hindered by the presence of highly repetitive sequences localized to the centromeric and pericentromeric regions in asparagus chromosomes  <cit> . the sex determination mechanism in dioecious plants remains unclear. given that mirnas are likely to participate in sex differentiation/maintenance, we employed high-throughput sequencing in the present study to explore the complex mirna-mediated regulatory networks, which control asparagus reproductive development, especially sex determination. a total of  <dig> mirnas were found to be significantly and differentially expressed between male and female asparagus , which may be associated with sex determination. based on the sequencing data,  <dig> mirnas including aof-mir159a, aof-mir167g, and aof-mir172b were significantly upregulated in female plants, whereas the other  <dig> mirnas including aof-mir165a and aof-mirn <dig> were upregulated in male plants. in particular, aof-mirn <dig> was only detected in male plants . these differentially expressed mirnas were further verified by qrt-pcr. previous studies showed that most of these differentially expressed mirnas performed multiple regulatory functions in floral organ formation and differentiation. the mir <dig> family is thought to target mrnas encoding myb proteins, it has been showed that myb <dig> which bind to the promoter of the floral meristem identity gene leafy, as well as myb <dig>  could redundantly facilitate anther development in arabidopsis  <cit> . in the present study, aof-mir <dig> was predicted to target eif- <dig>  which functions in the early stages of protein synthesis by forming a ternary complex with gtp and the initiator trna followed by binding to the 40s ribosomal subunit, however, there is no evidence at present to show the correlation of eif- <dig> with sex differentiation and floral organ development. the mir <dig> family in asparagus could target mrnas encoding floral homeotic protein ap <dig>  which affects arabidopsis flower development  <cit> . furthermore, mir <dig> in maize could target ap <dig> to control sex determination  <cit> . scarecrow-like protein  <dig>  which was suggested to influence gibberellin signaling in arabidopsis  <cit> , was predicted to be targeted by four mir <dig> family mumbers in asparagus. since gibberellin could promote stamen and anther development in arabidopsis  <cit> , and promote masculinity in cannabis sativa and spinacia oleracea  <cit> , the scarecrow-like protein  <dig> could be inferred to have a role in sex determination in asparagus.

auxin is implicated in various physiological and developmental processes in plants. arf has been reported to regulate flower and leaf development by controlling auxin responses  <cit> . mir <dig> was reported to target arf <dig> genes, whereas mir160a may target arf16/ <dig>  arf <dig> is a transcriptional suppressor involved in regulation of ethylene, auxin, aba, and brassinosteroid to control the onset of leaf senescence, floral organ abscission and ovule development  <cit> . arf <dig> promotes transitions between multiple stages of arabidopsis development and positively regulates flower development  <cit> . in arabidopsis, arf <dig> and arf <dig> were validated as targets of mir <dig> and essential for the fertility of ovules and anthers  <cit> . recently, liu et al.  <cit>  suggested that the mir <dig> family is essential for regulating gynoecium and stamen development in immature tomato flowers by modulating the expression levels of slarf <dig> and slarf <dig>  in the present study, the expression level of some mir <dig> family genes was significantly higher in female asparagus than that in male plants. the levels of aof-mir167g and aof-mir167b were at least 2-fold higher in female flowers than that in male ones. the high levels of mir <dig> in females can down-regulate arf <dig> or arf <dig> expression and thus regulate fruit and seed development. we found that the expression levels of arf <dig> increased during flower development. arf <dig> was highly expressed in 4 mm female and male flowers, as indicated by the low expression of its corresponding mirna in 4 mm flowers. previous studies have shown that sex differentiation did not occur in  <dig>  mm asparagus flowers  <cit> , thereby implying the important roles of mir <dig> and arf <dig> in floral differentiation in the later development stages. furthermore, the expression level of arf <dig> was higher in 4 mm female flowers than that in males, thereby suggesting that arf <dig> may be required to support gynoecium growth, as proved by previous studies  <cit> . further research on mirnas is worthwhile, particularly with regard to floral differentiation and sex determination.

CONCLUSIONS
high-throughput sequencing technology was used for the first time to identify  <dig> known and  <dig> candidate novel mirnas in a. officinalis plants. through degradome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis,  <dig> non-redundant targets for conserved and novel mirna were identified. these potential targets in asparagus are involved in diverse biological processes, including hormone signaling, flower development, metabolism and transcription regulation. the expression levels of the identified mirnas and their corresponding targets were compared between male and female plants and verified by qrt-pcr. several important mirnas with different expression levels between male and female individuals are suggested to be sex-chromosome specific and associated with reproductive organ development and sex determination in asparagus. given that the complete asparagus genome sequence remains unavailable, the full set of asparagus mirnas and their targets should be further investigated. nonetheless, our research provides a basis to elucidate the complex mirna-mediated regulatory networks that control development and other physiological processes in asparagus.
