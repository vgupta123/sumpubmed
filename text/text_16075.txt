BACKGROUND
photosynthetic organisms perform many functions of significance to the planet and society. plants and photosynthetic microbes are responsible for harvesting solar energy, evolving oxygen and sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide  <cit> . in addition, algae, cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria are either naturally able to or have been modified to evolve hydrogen , accumulate oils and hydrocarbons, or produce alcohols or other compounds that can reduce society's dependence on fossil fuels  <cit> . the ability to understand, capitalize on or improve these activities is limited by our knowledge of the metabolic blueprint of photosynthetic organisms. to fill this knowledge gap, we are modeling the flow of carbon and reducing power in the well-studied photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides. this facultative bacterium is capable of either aerobic or anaerobic respiration, depending on the availability of oxygen  or alternative electron acceptors. when o <dig> is absent or limiting, light energy can be harnessed by a photosynthetic electron transport chain that has features similar to those used by plants and other oxygen-evolving phototrophs  <cit> . during photosynthetic growth, r. sphaeroides is capable of autotrophic or heterotrophic growth using either carbon dioxide  or organic carbon sources  <cit> . thus, it provides an ideal system for studying the details of each lifestyle and the mechanisms of transition between these various metabolic states.

r. sphaeroides has also received significant attention due to its biotechnological potential, with its ability to produce large amounts of carotenoids or isoprenoids as a source of biocommodities, h <dig> as a potential biofuel, or polyhydroxybutyrate  as raw material for biodegradable plastics  <cit> . furthermore, the autotrophic metabolism of r. sphaeroides makes it a potential organism for use in the synthesis of chemicals or polymers that can serve as raw materials in the production of biofuels, or as a means of sequestering atmospheric or industrially-produced co <dig>  <cit> . to understand and tap into the activities or products of this photosynthetic bacterium, detailed knowledge of its metabolic pathways is necessary. to provide this knowledge, we are generating computational models of the metabolic network of r. sphaeroides that are based on genomic information, which can be informed and integrated with laboratory analysis of wild type and mutant strains  <cit> .

over the last decade the field of constraint-based metabolic modeling has witnessed significant progress, which has led to major advances in the modeling, understanding and engineering of different biological systems  <cit> . as a consequence, high quality genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have been generated for many organisms  <cit> . these reconstructions serve both as structured databases of all the known and/or predicted metabolic functions of an organism and as the basis for the construction of mathematical models used in constraint-based analysis. the ability of constraint-based analyses to provide new biological insights has the potential to increase with the influx of high-throughput biological data sets  <cit> . thus far, genome-scale reconstructions have been published for only one photosynthetic microbe, the oxygenic cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> . models of photosynthetic electron transport  <cit>  and small scale r. sphaeroides metabolic networks that use flux balance analysis   <cit>  and ensemble modeling  <cit>  have also been published.

here we present irsp <dig>  a manually curated genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for r. sphaeroides strain  <dig> . <dig> consisting of  <dig> metabolites,  <dig> transformation reactions and  <dig> transport reactions. the reconstruction includes  <dig>  genes, covering about 25% of the recognized r. sphaeroides open reading frames. to facilitate improved predictions, the biomass composition of r. sphaeroides was determined under a variety of growth conditions and used in generating biomass objective functions suitable for developing predictive models. fba  <cit> , flux variability analysis   <cit>  and alternate optima analysis  <cit>  were used to predict metabolic fluxes under chemoheterotrophic , photoheterotropic and photoautotrophic  growth conditions. the predictive ability of irsp <dig> was validated by comparison with experimentally determined growth rate and fluxes of key metabolic products from continuous cultures. irsp <dig> was also used to predict metabolic flux distributions through key pathways including co <dig> fixation and the electron transport chain. overall, irsp <dig> shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental observations. thus, irsp <dig> provides concepts and a basis for extensive future studies of this bacterium, other related bacteria and photosynthetic organisms in general.

RESULTS
model reconstruction
the initial r. sphaeroides metabolic network was constructed by extracting genomic and metabolic information from kegg  <cit> , and combining this with results from metashark  <cit>  analysis . we assigned directions to reactions in the network via a combination of thermodynamic and heuristic calculations/assumptions, which have been used previously  <cit>  . the r. sphaeroides model was further analyzed for stoichiometrically balanced cycles  - internal network loops that carry flux in a closed system  with no net production or consumption of metabolites  <cit> . sbcs were manually eliminated from the network leading to the assignment of directionality to an additional  <dig> reactions in the network . the remaining  <dig>  reactions for which there was insufficient thermodynamic information were assigned as reversible. the directionality assignments in irsp <dig> are summarized in table  <dig> 

* others includes groups of reactions assigned as irreversible based on sbc analysis or literature 

gaps in the initial reconstruction, representing limitations in our current understanding of r. sphaeroides metabolism, were identified and filled . this process led to the addition of  <dig> transformation and  <dig> transport reactions to the network  and produced a model capable of predicting the production of biomass under defined conditions. fva analysis with a completely open system  showed  <dig> blocked reactions remained at this stage, but these generally involved reactions  required for the biosynthesis of low abundance end products  that are not considered as part of our biomass objective function. thus, these  <dig> reactions are related to dead ends in irsp <dig> 

formulation of biomass objective function
to obtain qualitative and quantitative outputs from constraint-based modeling using genome-scale models, the use of a meaningful objective function is critical  <cit> . currently, the most widely used objective function in constraint-based modeling is the biomass objective function , as it represents a meaningful, though not necessarily accurate, ultimate goal of a microbial cell. while r. sphaeroides is a gram-negative bacterium, and in many respects similar to e. coli during aerobic growth, photosynthetic growth requires significant changes in metabolic machinery, and thus biomass composition, most notably in the pigment and lipid composition, as large amounts of chlorophyll or carotenoid pigments and phospholipids are contained in intracytoplasmic membrane  that houses the photosynthetic apparatus  <cit> . thus, to generate representative bofs for r. sphaeroides, we experimentally determined the major macromolecular constituents of aerobically and photosynthetically grown cells . based on these experimentally determined macromolecular components , available genome sequence data  <cit>  and published compositions of fatty acids and lipids  <cit> , the bofs were formulated as weighted combinations of precursors, with coefficients directly related to their percent composition of the biomass  <cit> . details of the biomass calculations are contained in additional file  <dig>  the growth associated maintenance  energy requirement was estimated as previously described  <cit> .

overview of irsp1095
irsp <dig> consists of  <dig> unique metabolites,  <dig> transformation reactions,  <dig> transport reactions and  <dig> exchange reactions . the list of reactions, metabolites, thermodynamic calculations, genes and references used are in additional file  <dig>  the network is divided into  <dig> compartments , with appropriate transport reactions across the outer and inner membranes. individual metabolites, including cytoplasmic, periplasmic or extracellular instances of a given metabolite, were given reconstruction-specific unique identifiers for internal use, which were mapped to other database identifiers . the irsp <dig> reconstruction accounts for  <dig>  genes representing ~25% of the annotated r. sphaeroides open reading frames. of the  <dig> reactions in irsp <dig>   <dig>   have gene-protein-reaction  assignments, with  <dig> of these having associated experimental data, while  <dig>  of the reactions without gpr assignments correspond to place holder reactions for which a putative gene could not be assigned. the remaining  <dig> reactions correspond to known spontaneous or diffusion reactions . the breakdown of the sub-system distribution of the reactions is shown in figure 1a. analysis of the distribution of the gene products in irsp <dig> using cluster of orthologous groups  classification  <cit> , shows that  <dig> of the  <dig> cog categories are significantly enriched for the proteins present in the model , with amino acid metabolism having the highest number and nucleotide metabolism showing the greatest coverage . the genome-scale reconstruction was converted into a stoichiometric matrix consisting of  <dig> rows and  <dig> columns, including exchange reactions to allow metabolites to be taken up or secreted in to the extracellular space, as well as  <dig> demand reactions for key metabolites not included in the biomass reaction  . the equivalent sbml format of the model was generated for distribution and potential use in other modeling environments . this file has been deposited in the biomodels database  <cit>  .

model validation
we used fba and other constraint-based approaches to interrogate the properties of the irsp <dig>  with simulations conducted for aerobic respiration, dark anaerobic respiration in the presence of the electron acceptor dimethyl sulfoxide  and photoheterotrophic growth  using sistrom's minimal media   <cit>  containing one of a variety of carbon sources . photoautotrophic growth with co <dig> as the sole source of carbon and h <dig> or hydrogen sulfide  as the electron donor was also simulated.

qualitative assessment of metabolic model
as a first step in assessing the performance and breadth of irsp <dig>  we used fba to test for the ability of the model to predict the production of biomass and h <dig> while supplied with sis minimal media. the model was capable of predicting growth in the dark in the presence of o <dig> or dmso as known electron acceptors, under photoautotrophic conditions using co <dig> as the sole carbon source and either h <dig> or h2s as electron donor, and photoheterotropically with a variety of organic carbon sources . in addition, when the ability to utilize the various carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur sources present in irsp <dig> was tested, it predicted photosynthetic growth on  <dig> potential carbon sources,  <dig> potential nitrogen sources,  <dig> potential phosphorus sources and  <dig> potential sulfur sources. while no high throughput phenotypic screens have been conducted for r. sphaeroides, growth on  <dig> of the carbon sources predicted by irsp <dig> to support net biomass formation  have previously been reported  <cit>  , while those carbon sources not yet tested as growth substrates in the literature provide candidates for future validation and correction of the model.

* +/+ growth and h <dig> production predicted; +/- growth but no h <dig> production predicted; -/- no growth

a oxygen  or dmso was used as the sole electron acceptors in simulations.

b succinate and lactate uptake rates were set to  <dig> mmol/g dw h, while the nh <dig> and glutamate uptake rates were set to  <dig> mmol/g dw h, as these are within the rate of experimentally observed uptake rates for these substrates. co <dig>  h <dig> and n <dig> uptake rates were set to  <dig> mmol/g dw h for photoautotrophic growth simulations.

an extensive set of r. sphaeroides mutants does not currently exist for validation of gene knock-out simulations using irsp <dig>  however, gene essentiality analysis still allows us to generate hypotheses about genes and reactions that are potentially essential under one or more growth conditions. we used fba to conduct single reaction and gene deletion analyses during simulations of photoheterotrophic growth using succinate as a carbon source and ammonia as the nitrogen source . under these conditions, irsp <dig> predicts that a core set of  <dig> reactions  are essential for growth . seventy of these "essential" reactions are associated with isozymes and thus would potentially require multiple gene deletions to inactive the cognate pathway. fva analysis at optimal growth rate, predicts that  <dig>  of the reactions in the network are capable of carrying flux, but are not essential for growth on minimal media containing succinate as a carbon source. an additional  <dig>  of the reactions are predicted to be incapable of carrying flux during photoheterotrophic growth on succinate and ammonia and correspond to transport and transformation steps not required under these conditions but could potentially be essential under alternative growth conditions. the remaining  <dig>  of the reactions in the network cannot carry flux under any of the conditions tested . furthermore, single gene deletion analysis showed that  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes present in irsp <dig> were essential for growth under these conditions . the distribution of these gene products based on cog classification is shown in figure 2b.

quantitative assessment of irsp1095
to assess irsp <dig> quantitatively, we used fba and alternate optima analysis to sample the feasible solution space and make predictions about specific growth rate and the rate of production of key metabolic products during photoheterotrophic growth on a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources , as well as during aerobic growth on succinate and ammonia. we compared the predicted fluxes to experimentally determined growth rate and production rates for these key metabolites during r. sphaeroides growth in continuous culture. the model was constrained with experimentally determined uptake rates for the various carbon and nitrogen sources, while being freely allowed to take up all other media components, as well as absorb light. we found that irsp <dig> was capable of accurately predicting cellular growth rate, with predictions generally within  <dig>  - 25% of the experimentally observed growth rate , with an overall correlation of  <dig>   across the conditions tested. the fba predicted growth rate is generally slightly higher than that observed experimentally . these observed differences could be the result of several factors, including stress and feedback inhibition, which cannot be captured in stoichiometric models. furthermore, many laboratory strains are not necessarily evolved for maximization of growth and thus do not meet the fba predicted growth rate prior to adaptive evolution experiments  <cit> . nevertheless, the predicted growth rates are closer to experimental observations than results previously seen in some other organisms  <cit> , suggesting r. sphaeroides strain  <dig> . <dig> is not as far from optimal growth under the conditions we analyzed.

solutions to linear programming problems are not always unique  <cit> , thus several distinct flux distributions could potentially result in the predicted optimal growth rate. to search the feasible solution space for the possible optimal solutions achievable by irsp <dig> given the constraints on substrate uptake rates, we used a mixed integer linear programming -based alternate optima algorithm  <cit> . a small subset of the reactions in irsp <dig> predicted to function as sinks for excess reducing power were used in sampling the optimal subspace . this analysis led to the identification of some  <dig> -  <dig> equivalent optimal solutions, across the various conditions tested, that differed in their pattern of flux distributions. the optimal solution with fluxes for h <dig>  phb and co <dig> presented in figure 3b, 3c and 3d respectively, represents one where non-zero fluxes for all  <dig> metabolites were observed in the same solution and which most closely matched the observed experimental data. in addition, the fva predicted maximum and minimum production rates of these metabolites were assessed. overall, the predicted amounts of h <dig>  phb and co <dig> generally ranged from within 4% to 200% of the experimentally measured fluxes . furthermore, constraining the model with the experimentally observed fluxes for phb, h <dig> and co <dig> did not result in decreases in the maximum predicted growth rate for most cultures, suggesting that these experimentally determined flux distributions are also within the optimal subspace. however, applying these constraints to simulations of photoheterotrophic growth on succinate + glutamate and aerobic growth on succinate + nh <dig> decreases the predicted growth rate, suggesting the organism is growing sub-optimally under these conditions . overall, the experimentally measured fluxes generally fell within the optimal solution space of our simulations.

sensitivity analysis
further analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of bof composition, light uptake and p/o ratio on growth and metabolite production rates in irsp <dig> . these analyses showed that:  growth rate predictions are not significantly affected by changes in bof composition, however the production rate of certain metabolites  can be affected ;  the predicted growth rate and production rates for phb and h <dig> increased with increasing light until they reached a plateau, while the predicted co <dig> production decreased with light uptake, presumably reflecting improved carbon assimilation as biomass increased ; and  the p/o ratio can have a significant impact on growth rate, as seen in other metabolic models  <cit>  .

evaluation of h <dig> production by r. sphaeroides
h <dig> serves as a major electron sink for the dissipation of excess substrate reducing power during anoxic phototrophic growth in r. sphaeroides  <cit> . h <dig> production in r. sphaeroides mainly results from nitrogenase activity, through the coupling of n <dig> fixation with h <dig> production  <cit> . however, nitrogenase will also reduce protons, producing h <dig> when n <dig> is absent  <cit> . since high levels of ammonium inhibit nitrogenase activity, h <dig> production can be stimulated by supplying the culture with an alternative nitrogen source, such as glutamate  <cit> . while there is no evidence of h <dig> production by the hydrogenase of r. sphaeroides, h <dig> accumulation in r. sphaeroides cultures can also be affected by the presence of this enzyme if h <dig> is reutilized by the cells  <cit> .

as a specific application of irsp <dig> we evaluated h <dig> production when r. sphaeroides is grown on one of several carbon sources with glutamate used as the only nitrogen source, under anoxic photosynthetic conditions. figure 4a shows sensitivity plots of the relationship between growth rate and h <dig> production capacity. the theoretical maximum h <dig> production while maximizing growth is achieved at the optimal growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> . however, for all carbon sources tested the theoretical h <dig> production maxima were reached under suboptimal growth conditions with biomass fluxes around  <dig> - <dig>  h- <dig>  for comparison to experimental production rates, a reference chemostat yielded a h <dig> flux that was about two thirds of the theoretical maximum of  <dig>  mmol/g dw h . for cells using glutamate as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen , irsp <dig> predicts little to no h <dig> production near maximum growth, consistent with our experimental observations with glutamate only cultures, which produced no detectable h <dig> 

in figure 4a, the maximal value derived by irsp <dig> was predicted to be larger for more reduced compounds  and smaller for less reduced carbon sources . thus, an important question is whether maximum h <dig> production is a function of the substrate reducing power only or is also affected by substrate-specific pathways. to address this question, we converted substrate uptake and h <dig> production rates to electron fluxes using the stoichiometry of half reactions for electron donation and acceptance  <cit> . we found that the maximum h <dig> production potential for growing cells was linearly related to the available electrons from the substrates  as shown in figure 4b . the linear trend indicates that h <dig> producing capacity is proportional to substrate reducing power, irrespective of the carbon source. the intercept of this relationship, where no electrons are available to support h <dig> production, shows the reducing power that supports growth alone. the derived slope, which equals  <dig>  indicates that maximizing h <dig> production can theoretically be achieved by directing all electrons in excess of that required for growth to h <dig> production. this is a significant finding since there are multiple competing pathways that can dissipate substrate reducing power, so this result suggests that h <dig> production can be increased from experimental values to theoretical maxima if these other pathways are silenced.

an interesting prediction from these data  is that growing cells can support a larger h <dig> production potential than resting cells, since, in all cases studied, metabolism with no flux in the biomass reaction yielded the lowest maxima of h <dig> flux. therefore, the breakdown of substrates in biomass synthesis pathways seems necessary to provide maximal reducing power for h <dig> production. the relationship of theoretical maxima at the no-growth condition to the reducing power of the substrates was similar to those with growing cells . that is, the slope of the no-growth curve was also equal to  <dig>  indicating that h <dig> can be theoretically maximized when all excess electrons are converted to h <dig>  however, the model also predicted a baseline of reducing power not converted to h <dig>  which is represented in figure 4b by the intercept of the no-growth line with the horizontal axis. the flux distribution output from irsp <dig> suggests h2s as the product accumulating this reducing power baseline.

metabolic flux distributions
we used fba to predict metabolic flux distributions during aerobic, photoheterotrophic and photoautotrophic growth.

photoautotrophic growth
as expected, during photoautotrophic growth irsp <dig> predicts there is a high flux through ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  and the calvin cycle, as it represents a major pathway for co <dig> assimilation  <cit> . however, previous analysis of r. sphaeroides has shown that a rubisco mutant  is still capable of photoautotrophic growth, when using less reduced electron donors than h <dig>   <cit> , suggesting that alternative co <dig> assimilation pathways can support growth under these conditions. pyruvate carboxylase has previously been shown not be one of these alternative routes  <cit> . irsp <dig> predicts that the ethylmalonyl pathway, involved in acetyl-coa assimilation, is a candidate for co <dig> sequestration under these conditions. the first enzyme in this pathway, crotonyl-coa carboxylase/reductase, catalyzes the reductive carboxylation of crotonyl-coa to ethylmalonyl-coa  <cit>  and irsp <dig> predicts this pathway can carry sufficient flux for photoautotrophic growth in the absence of rubisco. only when the flux through both the rubisco and crotonyl-coa carboxylase/reductase reactions are set to zero in the model, does photoautotrophic growth with thiosulfate or sulfide cease to be predicted by irsp <dig>  suggesting it is potentially an alternative route of co <dig> fixation in r. sphaeroides, and the only one currently incorporated in the model that is capable of supporting photoautotrophic growth in the absence of rubisco.

photoheterotrophic growth
fba simulation of photoheterotrophic growth on succinate and ammonia predicts metabolic flux through reactions involved in the tca cycle, as might be expected, with significant amounts of h <dig> being produced as the rate of ammonia uptake used in simulation  results in nitrogen limiting conditions, allowing excess succinate supplied to the model to be converted to h <dig>  irsp <dig> does not predict flux through rubisco to be essential for photoheterotrophic growth; however, it is known that rubisco is essential for photoheterotrophic growth of wild-type r. sphaeroides on carbon sources like succinate and malate, where there is reductive assimilation of co <dig>  <cit> . alternate optima analysis  <cit>  predicts a few fba optima exist wherein rubisco is used as a major electron sink, however other fba optima predict the extensive utilization of one or more alternative pathways to recycle excess reducing power including:  nitrogenase activity resulting in the production of large amounts of h2;  the sulfite reductase reaction resulting in the production of h2s;  phb synthesis; or  the use of the ethylmalonyl pathway . previous, analyses of r. sphaeroides rubisco mutants have shown that cells are capable of reprogramming their regulatory network to restore photoheterotrophic growth on electron-rich carbon sources  <cit> . the alternative reactions known to be utilized to restore photoheterotrophic growth under these conditions include nitrogenase reaction yielding h <dig> and sulfate reduction to h2s  <cit> . thus the observed alternate optima predicted in irsp <dig> likely represent distinct functional states, all achievable by r. sphaeroides based on its metabolic capabilities, but the wild type organism is largely restricted to only a limited number of these as a result of its complex and highly evolved regulatory network, which keeps most of these other functional states silent in the absence of perturbation. given that these regulatory constraints are not present in irsp <dig>  the majority of these functional states are thus achievable, allowing for the prediction of growth in the absence of rubisco.

analysis of electron transport chain activity during photoheterotrophic growth shows significant flux through ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase  and nadh dehydrogenase, with both enzymes predicted as being essential during growth on succinate and ammonia. the essentiality of the fbc complex might be expected as it serves as the only means of providing reduced cytochromes required for the photosynthetic light reaction  <cit> . in contrast, the requirement for nadh dehydrogenase activity during photoheterotrophic growth on succinate is proposed to reflect the need to oxidize ubiquinol and generate nadh for anabolic reactions  <cit> . indeed, during anaerobic growth, irsp <dig> predicts that nadh dehydrogenase uses the transmembrane electron potential to drive the oxidation of ubiquinol to ubiquinone and the concomitant reduction of nad+ to nadh , thus freeing up ubiquinone for use in the cell, while providing nadh for biosynthetic reactions. furthermore, irsp <dig> predicts that addition of dmso would restore photoheterotrophic growth in the absence nadh dehydrogenase, as might be expected if cells lacking this enzyme were unable to balance electron flux. it should be noted however, that the predicted essentiality of nadh dehydrogenase during photoheterotrophic growth appears to be conditional, as irsp <dig> predicts that growth occurs with other carbon sources which apparently have less of a requirement for nadh dehydrogenase activity.

aerobic growth
fba simulations of aerobic respiratory growth on succinate and ammonia predict significant flux through the tca cycle and reactions specific to succinate metabolism with the concomitant production of large amounts of co <dig> and trace amounts of urea. irsp <dig> also predicts that cyctochrome c oxidase  activity is sufficient and required for optimal aerobic respiratory growth. in the absence of cox activity, quinol oxidase , which is capable of ubiquinol oxidation to ubiquinone coupled to direct o <dig> reduction, is predicted to support aerobic respiratory growth, but the predicted growth rate in this mutant is only 60% of the predicted optimum. a similar reduced growth rate is also predicted in the absence of the fbc complex, as this also results in flux being directed through qox in order to oxidize ubiquinol . this observed reduction in growth rate might be expected as flux through the fbc and the cox complexes pumps  <dig> protons across the membrane, while flux through qox, which bypasses both enzymes, results in only  <dig> protons being pumped across the membrane, thus providing much less energy for the cell . interestingly, nadh dehydrogenase, which is predicted by irsp <dig> to be essential during photoheterotrophic growth on succinate and ammonia, is not predicted to be essential during aerobic respiration. indeed, only an ~8% decrease in growth rate is predicted during aerobic respiration in the absence of nadh dehydrogenase activity. since ubiquinol can be oxidized either via the fbc-cox pathway or qox, nadh dehydrogenase activity is no longer required these conditions. thus, irsp <dig> predicts that nadh dehydrogenase functions in nadh oxidation during aerobic respiration and contributes to formation of a proton gradient across the membrane .

discussion
previous research has shown the potential of constraint-based analysis for understanding metabolic networks  <cit> . given the well-studied photosynthetic lifestyle and biotechnological potential of r. sphaeroides, irsp <dig> provides an enabling framework that should increase our understanding of and ability to improve its metabolic machinery. one of the major challenges faced by photosynthetic and many other bacteria is the need to balance the generation of reducing equivalents obtained from light or carbon sources with pathways that consume these electrons. previous analysis has shown that r. sphaeroides partitions significant proportions of reducing equivalents into cellular biomass, phb, excreted organic acids or h <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, genetic analysis suggests that co <dig> fixation via rubisco is also essential for recycling excess reductant during photoheterotrophic growth. analysis of the flow of reducing equivalents in irsp <dig> reveals that r. sphaeroides has several alternate means to potentially recycle reducing equivalents, but not all of these are functional in wild type cells. in addition to known processes like co <dig> fixation via rubisco, phb synthesis and h <dig> production  <cit> , irsp <dig> also predicts h2s production by sulfite reductase activity, reductive carbon assimilation via the ethylmalonyl pathway and secretion of metabolites  as alternative routes for dissipating excess reducing power. while the role of some of these processes have been experimentally verified  <cit> , others represent novel predictions. the dependence of wild type r. sphaeroides on rubisco for photoheterotrophic growth, a phenotype not corroborated by irsp <dig>  suggests that these alternative routes for dissipating excess reducing power could either represent silent functional states or are insufficiently active to support growth in the absence of the calvin cycle.

our evaluation of h <dig> production potential of r. sphaeroides with irsp <dig> showed that continuous culture performance reached two-thirds of the predicted maximum h <dig> production . to harness the remaining potential predicted by irsp <dig>  pathways that contribute to and compete with h <dig> production needed to be determined. interestingly, biomass synthesis is predicted by irsp <dig> to be a contributor to h <dig> production. therefore, we analyzed the pathways that divert electrons from h <dig> production in growing cells, when succinate and glutamate were the substrates. this analysis predicts a set of reactions  whose collective elimination would yield a h <dig> production rate of  <dig>  mmol/g dw h, very close to the theoretical maximum of  <dig>  mmol/g dw h that was predicted by irsp <dig>  five of the products in table  <dig> are intermediates in cell synthesis pathways and cannot compete with h <dig> production under optimal growth conditions . hence, these reactions provide predictions on the pool of electrons that can be diverted from biomass synthesis to h <dig> production.

*competitors for sub-optimal growth conditions only.

** secretion of central metabolism intermediates pyruvate, fumarate, and malate were blocked, assuming that cells are programmed to reuse these compounds as carbon sources even after secretion. this was based on observations with batch cultures  <cit> , but might not hold true for continuous cultures.

fba has also enabled us to model the flow of electrons through the aerobic respiratory chain. r. sphaeroides possesses two cytochrome oxidases : aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase and cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase, which carry out the same reaction but have different oxygen affinities. r. sphaeroides also possesses two quinol oxidases  - qoxba and qxtab - that provide a less energetically efficient means for recycling reduced electron carriers  <cit> . while it is possible that both cox and qox could be used simultaneously, maximization for biomass during fba simulations results in only the more efficient fbc-cox portion of etc being utilized. mutational analysis has shown that deletion of either qox or qxt has no effect on aerobic growth rate  <cit> , which is in agreement with the predictions of irsp <dig>  in addition, mutation of the fbc complex, which is predicted to redirect flux through the qox pathway, results in a two fold increase in doubling time experimentally, which is almost identical to the predictions of irsp <dig> . furthermore, the loss of both cox and qox activity is also correctly predicted by irsp <dig> to be lethal under aerobic conditions. thus, irsp <dig> accurately models the flux distribution through the aerobic respiratory chain. the reversibility of the nadh dehydrogenase reaction predicted by irsp <dig> and its essentiality during photosynthetic growth has previously been observed in the closely related photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus  <cit> . furthermore, conclusions on the essential role of nadh dehydrogenase in synthesizing nadh for anabolic processes under photosynthetic conditions are in agreement with predictions of irsp <dig>  unlike r. capsulatus, r. sphaeriodes is predicted to contain two isozymes of the nadh dehydrogenase complex, with genes encoding both enzymes being expressed during photoheterotrophic growth  <cit> . experimental analysis of the role of each nadh dehydrogenase isozymes during anaerobic growth in r. sphaeroides is required to compare with the predictions of irsp <dig> 

finally our simulations predict that several alternative optimal solutions are often possible under any given condition, reinforcing the need to analyze the space of alternate optima  <cit> . the diverse metabolic capabilities of r. sphaeroides reinforces the challenge of making accurate predictions about condition-dependent metabolic fluxes as not all feasible functional states are relevant to wild type cells. thus, to obtain improved predictions of the flux distributions through the network of wild-type r. sphaeroides, additional constraints on irsp <dig> will be required.

CONCLUSIONS
irsp <dig> represents the first comprehensive genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for a facultative photosynthetic bacterium. this genome-scale reconstruction has enabled us to examine the metabolic capabilities of this purple non-sulfur bacterium. our modeling results predict that r. sphaeroides possesses multiple pathways that could be exploited as electron sinks during photoheterotrophic growth, though experimental results suggest many of these are silent in wild type cells. other results predict that additional gains in h <dig> production are possible as the production capacity of wild type cells is only about two-thirds of the theoretical maximum, with pathways and reactions that could increase production predicted using irsp <dig>  an alternative route for co <dig> fixation, the ethylmalonyl pathway, was predicted using irsp <dig>  this prediction could potentially resolve the question of how r. sphaeroides assimilates co <dig> in the absence of rubisco. irsp <dig> also predicts the reversibility of the nadh dehydrogenase complex and its essentiality during photoheterotrophic growth on succinate, where it plays a key role in oxidation of ubiquinol. further experimental work is needed to confirm these predictions and improve our understanding of the metabolic network of this and possibly other related bacteria. finally, quantitative predictions made using irsp <dig> showed good agreement with experimental observations, verifying the utility of the model and highlighting the potential for its use in quantitative analysis of r. sphaeroides metabolism.
