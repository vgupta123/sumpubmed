BACKGROUND
amino acid composition varies in protein domain region and linker region  <cit> . structural domains define the basic building blocks of proteins. domains are frequently smaller than a protein, yet they epitomize the core principles of the entire protein structure; domains are compact, fold independently and often have a specific function  <cit> . the ability to identify domains is essential, as many types of protein analyses begin with the decomposition of the protein into its functional units – domains. identification of domains is a complex task and a large number of methods have been developed over last three decades to identify domains from the 3d coordinates of the protein structure  <cit> . none of the existing structure-based methods performs better than 85%  <cit> . the task is even more critical and more difficult when the structure of the protein is not known and domains are identified from sequence information alone. a number of sequence-based methods have been developed over the last six years, which identify linker regions between domains; this in turn leads to the identification of domains themselves. such methods use multiple sources of sequence-based information: for example: dompro  <cit>  used evolutionary information , secondary structure and solvent accessibility information with a recursive neural network; chopnet  <cit>  utilizes evolutionary information, amino acid composition and amino acid flexibility analyzed with a neural network; snapdragon  <cit>  predicts domain by using an ab initio protein folding method; domssea  <cit>  uses predicted secondary structure; the nagarajan & yona  <cit>  method is based on analyzing multiple sequence alignments from database search, position specific physio-chemical properties of amino acids and predicted secondary structure analyzed with a neural network; galzitskaya & melnik  <cit>  use side chain entropy of a region to predict domain boundaries; ssep-domain  <cit>  predicts domains by combining information of secondary structure element alignments, profile-profile alignments and pattern searches; armidillo  <cit>  uses amino acid composition to predict domain boundaries; domcut  <cit>  uses a linker index deduced from a data set of domain/linker segments; finally prodo  <cit>  uses a neural network from sequence information. many of the above methods focus exclusively on predicting boundaries for two-domain chains. the overall success rate for sequence-based methods is approximately 25–40% when limited to contiguous domains.

in this present study, we demonstrated that the performance of domaindiscovery is improved by including inter-domain linker region with a position-specific scoring matrix  generated from psi-blast  <cit> , secondary structural information and relative solvent accessibility data. we used secondary structure information and solvent accessibility information based on the assumption that secondary structure elements and level of solvent accessibility in the boundary regions are different from those found in the rest of the protein. the novel features are the use of a svm  and, most importantly, a unique training set built on the principle of consensus among experts in protein structure.

RESULTS
the comparison and assessment of domain predictors is complicated by the existence of several domain datasets/databases which sometimes conflict with each other  <cit> . to test our approach, we performed the following training and testing.

we divided benchmark_ <dig>  a dataset containing proteins of known structure for which three methods  agree on the assignment of the number of domains, into six clusters of  <dig> chains where each cluster includes 2-domains, 3-domains, 4-domains, 5-domains and 6-domains chains. one cluster was omitted and the svm trained using the remaining  <dig> clusters. this leave-one-out approach was repeated  <dig> times and the results are averaged. results are shown on fig- <dig> and fig- <dig> for domaindiscovery  and improved domaindiscovery respectively. we run each protein chain one by one for all methods. we observed that prediction accuracy increases with window size up to window  <dig> and then starts to decrease at window size  <dig>  for a window size of  <dig> the accuracy is 25% for multi domain protein chains, this increases to 65% for a window size of  <dig> .

in order to avoid any potential bias in the 6-fold validation test above, a set of  <dig> chains used for testing  was assembled by randomly selecting chains from the entire dataset of  <dig> 

in order to compare performance of our method with other methods, we tested the performance of domaindiscovery and five other methods on a single set of  <dig> chains . the methods were trained on the remaining  <dig> chains. the performance of each method is presented in table  <dig>  and summarized in table  <dig>  to circumvent the issue of non-contiguous domains, which exist in our dataset and which only one of the current methods  addresses, we consider each fragment to represent a separate domain. thus in the cases of discontinuous domains we artificially increase number of domains predicted by scop to match the total number of fragment rather than domains, such cases are labelled with an * in table  <dig> .

to perform sensitive evaluation of domain boundary prediction methods, we calculate both: presence/absence of domain boundaries and precision of placed boundaries. our approach precision of boundary placement  works as follows:

pbp = /length of the chain) * 100). we introduce nbf  if method predicts less number of boundaries or no boundary at all and ebf  if method predicts more boundary than scop domain boundary definition.

we observe that improved domaindiscovery performs at 92%, 95%, 88% and 100% accuracy for 1-domain, 2-domain, 3-domain & 4-domain protein chains, respectively and at 92% overall accuracy on the set of  <dig> chains tested . dompro  <cit>  performed very well on one-domain protein chains  but failed to predict domain boundaries for three or more domain chains . dompred  <cit>  achieved very good results for one-domain  and two-domain  chains but is less successful in predicting domains boundaries for three-domain chains . chop  <cit>  tries to cut chains into more domains than predicted by structural methods. ssep-domain  <cit>  performance was superior for one and two domain  chains, but below domaindiscovery performance for three or more domain chains. armadillo's  <cit>  tendency is to cut chains excessively as compared to other methods; which makes its performance inferior.

pbp was calculated to determine the average percentage value for the six methods in table  <dig> . all the percentage values were added for all the chains and divided by the number of domain boundaries predicted by the corresponding method. the precision measurement places improved domaindiscovery method in third position relative to other methods , however, the number of nbf and ebf is lower in improved domaindiscovery leading to a higher average. the ssep-domain method appears to be the most precise in placement of its domain boundaries. however, ssep-domain could not find boundaries for a few chains . dompro performed worst among the six methods. we did not penalize for nbf and ebf however it should be noted that the numbers of nbf and ebf is less in improved domaindiscovery than other methods. dompro  <cit>  has the highest number of nbf  and chop has the highest number of ebf .

an independent test set was evaluated against all methods to avoid the possibility that improved domaindiscovery and domaindiscovery might have an unfair advantage through being trained on part of the test dataset. for independent evaluation we used  <dig> targets from casp <dig>  results for the casp <dig> target lists are shown in table  <dig> , both domaindiscovery performed consistently well for one-and two-domains chains. since all the casp <dig> targets have no corresponding domain boundary information in scop, we could not perform percentage calculation for some chains, but we can get a grasp from the raw data in the table  <dig> . we observe that improved domaindiscovery performs at 92% and 75% accuracy for 1-domain & 2-domain protein chains, respectively and at 83% overall accuracy on the set of  <dig> chains tested . dompro <cit>  , dompred  and ssep-domain  with an accuracy of 67%. improved domaindiscovery performed better than existing methods, however, it is noted that the casp <dig> targets are predominantly 1-domain protein chains and thus is not an ideal test set for evaluating the prediction of multi-domain protein chains.

discussion
while there are many domain boundary assignment methods, none of them are able to delineate domain boundaries for multi-domain protein chains with high reliability. we developed improved domaindiscovery to address this issue. a support vector machine  approach was chosen for its efficiency and consistency. the benchmark_ <dig> dataset  <cit>  which has a high fraction of accurately determined multi-domain proteins provides an excellent training set for our method. improved domaindiscovery and domaindiscovery performed consistently in six-fold validation tests, when compared to other methods, ssep-domain  <cit>  performance is superior for single and two-domain chains but inferior for three-domain or larger chains. ssep-domain also shows a precise placement of domain boundaries – a subject that will require improvement in our method. ssep-domain authors shows that using interpro  <cit>  pattern searches boosts ssep-domain's performance. dompro  <cit>  predicts domain boundaries accurately for single domain chains. armadillo predicts single domain chains very poorly but performed reasonably for two-domain chains. in our evaluation another strong method is dompred  <cit>  which exhibits good performance with single and two-domain chains, but performs poorly with three or more domain chains. improved domaindiscovery works better than others because of the efficient use of the powerful machine learning algorithm like svm and training with clean dataset.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented an improved protein domain boundary prediction method, domaindiscovery, based on support vector machine  and training with structurally defined domains based on consensus among experts. in six-fold cross-validation technique using benchmark_ <dig> dataset we achieve 70% accuracy for the data that includes single-domain and multi-domain chains. performance of improved domaindiscovery is comparable or better than other recent sequence-based methods, particularly with regards to its performance on multi-domain chains. ssep-domain exhibits superior performance but the performance is limited to single and two-domain chains. improved domaindiscovery works all the time regardless of the length of the query protein whereas the most of the existing methods can't handle if query protein has a very long chain.

our future work will focus on improving accuracy of domain boundary prediction by enlarging our training dataset and/or including additional parameters for feature vectors in svm. additionally only one of the existing methods snapdragon  <cit>  is capable of predicting discontinuous domains  but it is computationally expensive and hence is not suitable for comprehensive sequence analysis. we are working to address assembly of non-contiguous domains from the predicted fragments by post-processing our current results though a probabilistic domain predictor similar to that of dgs <cit>  .
