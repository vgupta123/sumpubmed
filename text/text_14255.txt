BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria evolved more then  <dig>  billion years ago and were the first organisms to perform oxygenic photosynthesis  <cit> . they exist in many different shapes and forms e.g. unicellular, filamentous and colonial and can even form symbiosis with a variety of organisms  <cit> . several cyanobacterial strains also have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium, a process performed by the enzyme complex nitrogenase. among filamentous cyanobacteria like nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> and nostoc punctiforme atcc  <dig> , both used in the present study, this process takes place in specialised cells called heterocysts in which a thick envelope and lack of photosystem ii activity creates a nearly oxygen free environment for the nitrogenase  <cit> . the same nitrogenase is also a key player in the hydrogen  metabolism by producing h <dig> as a by-product during the fixing of atmospheric nitrogen . in addition, cyanobacteria may also possess distinct -hydrogenases.

the cyanobacterial hydrogenases can functionally be divided into two groups; uptake hydrogenases, dimeric hupsl, that consumes h <dig>  and bi-directional hydrogenases, pentameric hoxyhefu, that can both consume and produce h <dig>  <cit> . in the case of nostoc pcc  <dig> both hydrogenases may be present, while nostoc punctiforme only contains the uptake hydrogenase  <cit> .

the cyanobacterial uptake hydrogenase is closely connected to both the n2-fixing process and the occurrence of a nitrogenase, recycling the h <dig> and thereby regaining energy and electrons. the function of the bi-directional hydrogenase is more unclear and suggestions range from functioning as a mediator of reducing power during anaerobic conditions to it being part of respiratory complex i  <cit> .

both types of hydrogenases go through an extensive maturation process that involves several different accessory proteins. even though much is still to be learned about this maturation process in cyanobacteria, comprehensive studies in other organisms like escherichia coli have been performed  <cit> . particularly the large subunit of -hydrogenase  requires numerous accessory proteins responsible for metal transport, biosynthesis and insertion of the metal atoms nickel and iron into its active site. the genes encoding for these proteins are usually referred to as the hyp-genes and have been identified in many organisms including several cyanobacterial strains  <cit> . the hyp-proteins are considered unspecific and there is usually only one set of hyp-genes irrespective of the number hydrogenases in a single strain  <cit> . it was recently suggested that a set of protein encoding genes within the extended hyp-operon of nostoc pcc  <dig> may be involved in the maturation of the small subunit of the cyanobacterial uptake hydrogenase  <cit> .

the final step in the maturation process of the large subunit is a proteolytic cleavage of the c-terminal, which results in a conformational change, and the association of the large subunit to the small subunit  <cit> . the number of amino acids that are cleaved off varies between different hydrogenases and organisms but the cleavage always takes place after the conserved motif dpcxxcxxh/r resulting in the histidine being the new c-terminal amino acid  <cit> . several experiments together with sequencing data have indicated that these putative proteases, contrary to the hyp-proteins, are specific to different hydrogenases; not only to hydrogenases in different bacterial strains but also to different hydrogenases within the same strain  <cit> . in both nostoc punctiforme and nostoc pcc  <dig> putative proteases have been identified through secondary and tertiary structure alignments  <cit> . the protein product of the gene hupw is believed to process hupl  and can be found in both cyanobacterial strains. nostoc pcc  <dig> however, which in addition harbours a bi-directional hydrogenase, also contains hoxw whose protein product is believed to be involved in the processing of hoxh  <cit> .

it is still unknown exactly how the recognition of the different hydrogenases takes place and which part of the protease determines specificity. a crystal structure of a large subunit- protease complex is still not yet available from any organism. however, the protease hupd from e. coli has been crystallised giving vital clues about its function  <cit> . the importance of ni-incorporation into the active site for any cleavage to occur has been addressed  <cit>  and together with amino acid replacement experiments, it has been shown that nickel is an important substrate recognition motif. in addition the protease binds directly to the metal  <cit>  and the crystal structure of hybd in e. coli showed that three amino acids; glu <dig>  asp <dig> and his <dig>  are most likely to be involved in the metal binding  <cit> .

contrary to the lack of functional studies of cyanobacterial hydrogenases extensive studies have been done on the transcriptional regulation of cyanobacterial hydrogenases and their accessory genes  <cit> . several putative binding sites of different transcription factors have been reported in connection with the uptake hydrogenase such as fnr  in anabaena variabilis and the global nitrogen regulatory protein ntca in nostoc punctiforme, lyngbya majuscule ccap 1446/ <dig> and gloeothece sp. strain atcc  <dig> and ihf  in nostoc punctiforme and lyngbya majuscule ccap 1446/ <dig>  <cit> . participation by the transcription factor ntca fits in well with the known connection between the uptake hydrogenase and n <dig> fixation. further it has been shown that the uptake hydrogenase is only transcribed under n2-fixing conditions and in connection with heterocyst formation  <cit> .

the genes encoding the bi-directional hydrogenase, contrary to the uptake hydrogenase, are transcribed in both heterocysts and vegetative cells and under both non n2- and n2-fixing conditions  <cit> . so far, two transcription factors have been identified in connection with the bi-directional hydrogenase, lexa and an abrb-like protein  <cit> .

in the present study we investigate the transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding hydrogenase specific proteases hupw in nostoc punctiforme and hupw and hoxw in nostoc pcc  <dig>  under both n2-fixing and non n2-fixing conditions. in addition, we address the question of the diversity, specificity and evolution of the hydrogenase specific proteases in cyanobacteria.

RESULTS
diversity of cyanobacterial hydrogenase specific proteases
to examine the diversity of hydrogenase specific proteases and their relationship to each other, in cyanobacteria and other microorganisms, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using both paup and mrbayes analysis. since no suitable outgroup has been found for the proteases at this stage, a non-rooted tree was constructed including claude creditability values. the resulting tree from the mrbayes analysis revealed several subgroups among the hydrogenase specific proteases, which correlates with respective hydrogenase group according to vignais et al  <cit>  ;

 <dig>  bacterial proteases 

 <dig>  cyanobacterial proteases, hupw type 

 <dig>  bacterial and archaean proteases

a. archean proteases 

d. bacterial proteases, hoxw type 

 <dig>  bacterial and archaean proteases, hyc type 

the phylogenetic groups of the hydrogenase specific protease have been named according to the nomenclature used for -hydrogenase.

the result from the paup analysis is less resolved but supports the result from mrbayers analysis with some minor differences within group 3d .

an extended phylogenetic tree was also constructed containing more strains including hydrogenase specific proteases cleaving type 3b-hydrogenases. this tree was unfortunately less reliable and far from robust with several weak nodes . however the result showed putative group  <dig> proteases and putative group 3b proteases as less clustered and instead spread around point x .

transcriptional studies of hupw in nostoc punctiforme atcc  <dig> and nostoc sp strain pcc 7120
northern hybridisations were performed of hupw in both nostoc punctiforme and nostoc pcc  <dig> using both n2-fixing and non n2-fixing cultures . the results from nostoc pcc  <dig> revealed two transcripts. the first is shorter  and present under both n2-fixing and non n2-fixing conditions, while the second longer transcript  is only present under n2-fixing conditions. the size of the longer transcript is comparable with the size of a two-gene operon containing hupw together with the upstream gene alr <dig>  a gene of unknown function . rt-pcr confirmed that the two genes are co transcribed . additional 5'race experiments revealed three tsps whereby the first is located  <dig> bp upstream of hupw. succeeding bio-informatic studies identified a putative σ70-like - <dig> and - <dig> box   and two imperfect putative ntca binding sites . by running the complete intergenic region in blast at cyanobase two conserved regions were also discovered. both can be found in the intergenic regions of several genes in nostoc pcc  <dig> and anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig> . their function is unclear but one of them shows similarity to the consensus sequence watcaannnnttr from the previously described ihf binding sites  <cit> . the second and third tsps were identified inside the gene alr <dig>   <dig> bp and  <dig> bp downstream of the putative translation start site. a new putative translation start site within the same frame was found  <dig> bp downstream from the previously suggested start site. by analysing the sequence of the promoter region a - <dig> box , a - <dig> box  and two putative ntca binding sites  147/ <dig> bp and 62/ <dig> bp upstream of the two tsps were also identified.

for nostoc punctiforme a transcript of hupw of about  <dig> nt, is only present in n2-fixing cultures . 5'races identified a single tsp  <dig> bp upstream of hupw in nostoc punctiforme, together with a σ70-like - <dig> box sequence  and a putative ntca binding site  located  <dig> bp upstream from the tsp . the resulting transcript includes the upstream gene npun_f <dig>  which was confirmed by rt-pcr using primers for the subsequent pcr covering the intergenic region and agrees with the result from the northern blot experiments .

in silico analysis of alr <dig> and npun_f <dig> in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> and nostoc punctiforme atcc 29133
homologues to alr <dig> in nostoc pcc  <dig> are present in two other strains, anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  and trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig> . it shows no transmembrane regions or domains that would give an indication of its function.

the gene npun_f <dig> is of unknown function but a search with ncbi blast revealed four homologues in other microorganisms, all cyanobacterial; nostoc pcc  <dig>  anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  nodularia spumigena ccy  <dig> and in nostoc sp. pcc  <dig> . in nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> only parts of the genome are sequenced and in the 5'end of genbank accession number ab <dig> the first  <dig> bp of the gene can be identified. the gene is truncated in nodularia spumigena ccy  <dig> but is intact in the other strains and in two cases  it is located directly upstream of hupw and/or the uptake hydrogenase genes. alignments of the promoter sequence of these genes show highly conserved promoter regions, all containing putative ntca binding sites, - <dig> box, putative shine-dalgarno sequence and even suggests a putative tsp for four out of the five genes  . bio-informatic studies of npun_f <dig> propose a transmembrane region between amino acids 84– <dig> but showed no other domains or sites giving clues to its function. however, when comparing strains that either harbour or lack the gene, it was found that among the strains containing npun_f <dig> and its homologues, the ability to form heterocysts is a shared feature .

transciptional studies of hoxw in nostoc sp strain pcc 7120
hoxw is located between the genes all <dig>  and all <dig> , both with no known relationship to h <dig> metabolism, and around  <dig>  kbp downstream of the hoxhyu operon  <cit>  on the opposite strand .

northern blot hybridisation of hoxw was performed using rna isolated from both n2-fixing and non n2-fixing cultures indicating an increased level of hoxw under n2-fixing conditions and revealing several transcripts ranging from ~1000- <dig> nt . this was confirmed by 5'race experiments that showed tsps at both  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp upstream of hoxw. when analysing the promoter region, a σ70-like - <dig> box  was identified for the tsp,  <dig> bp upstreams of hoxw, but no - <dig> box while the tsp,  <dig> bp upstream of hoxw, contains a putative - <dig> box  but no clear - <dig> box .

when analysing the complete intergenic region between hoxw and its upstream gene all <dig> two conserved regions appeared . both regions can be found in between genes in numerous cases especially in the genome of nostoc pcc  <dig> and anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  the first conserved region, situated 204– <dig> bp upstream of hoxw, consists of four repeats, which when run through mfold forms a putative hairpin . the second region is located 162– <dig> bp upstream of hoxw and its sequence tagtagttatgtaattagctt shows resemblance to a lexa binding site, according to the previously defined motif rgtacnnndgtwcb together with a putative - <dig> box  <cit> .

specificity of hupw and hoxw in cyanobacteria
to address the protease specificity an alignment of protein sequences was performed to search for conserved regions specific to each protease group, hupw and hoxw , in cyanobacteria. this study revealed that one of the conserved regions among the proteases is highly dissimilar when comparing hupw and hoxw in cyanobacteria . in most proteases, including hupw, this region consists of the sequence dgt  while among the hoxw proteases it is replaced by the sequence hl  .

to get a better understanding of this region and its possible function bio-informatic work was performed targeting conserved and similar amino acids on the surface of putative hoxw and putative hupw in nostoc pcc  <dig> and hybd in e. coli together with protein-protein docking experiments using the docking algorithm bigger. the studies showed that the conserved residues are not evenly distributed but clustered around the proposed nickel binding residues glu <dig> and his <dig>   <cit>  and around the conserved "hoxbox" region for all three cases. in hupw and hybd conserved surface areas could also be found along alpha helix  <dig>  beta sheet  <dig> and alpha helix  <dig>  <cit>  .

protein docking experiments resulted in  <dig> hits for hybc-hybd ,  <dig> hits for hybb-hync  and  <dig> hits for hoxh-hoxw . the best hit for hybd in e. coli and hoxw in nostoc pcc  <dig> can be seen in figure 7c, a target-probe complex whereby the hoxbox of the protease is in a less favourable position for c-terminal cleavage. this means that the hoxbox is either facing away from the c-terminal or that other residues are blocking making it difficult for physical contact to occur without major conformation changes. this was the case for 70% of the hits and the average distance of gly42/his <dig>  in the hoxbox to the last amino acid of the c-terminal was around 17– <dig> Å. the majority of the hits indicated that the hoxbox region and the areas around alpha helix  <dig>  beta sheet  <dig> and alpha helix  <dig> are in close interaction with the large subunit of the hydrogenase. this is especially true for the hybc-hybd complex while hoxh-hoxw showed a preference for a more narrow interaction with only the closest residues around asp <dig> and his <dig> and the hoxbox involved in the contact with hupl. the preferred docking result for hybd in e. coli and hoxw in nostoc pcc  <dig> reflects the results from the studies of the conserved residues as can be seen when comparing figure 7b and figure 7c.

discussion
diversity of cyanobacterial hydrogenase specific proteases
previous phylogenetic studies of hydrogenases in different microorganisms  <cit>  clearly divide the proteins into four classes  <cit> . one of the most extensive studies, using over  <dig> microorganisms, showed that the large and the small subunit of the hydrogenase enzyme evolved together and have been two tightly connected subunits for probably all of their evolutionary history  <cit> . when comparing the evolution of hydrogenases with the present study of hydrogenase specific proteases some striking resemblances appear which indicate a similar development and co-evolution between the large subunit of the hydrogenases and their specific proteases .

within the phylogenetic tree of the hydrogenase specific proteases similar groups appear as seen among the hydrogenase subunits. this is especially true for the proteases in group  <dig>   <dig>  3a and  <dig>  just as the hydrogenase subunit hyce in e. coli  is most closely related to the archean hydrogenases  so is its hydrogenase specific protease hyci  most closely related to group  <dig> proteases. the resemblance between the phylogenetic trees suggests that the co-evolution between the hydrogenase and the hydrogenase specific protease is of ancient origin and an explanation for this might be found in the mechanism of the cleavage process. it has previously been suggested that a conformational recognition takes place between the protease and the large subunit  <cit>  which may through the years enhanced the specificity seem among proteases.

the hox-specific proteases of group 3d are the exception and can be found as an independent group . further studies, even though not as robust, also show proteases of 3b type and additional proteases of group  <dig> type being spread either individually or on branches around point x . these results contradict previous evolutionary studies of their respective hydrogenases which have placed group 3b/3d hydrogenases as clearly defined subgroups within group  <dig> -hydrogenases  <cit> . by comparing the -hydrogenase phylogenetic tree with the protease phylogenetic tree presented in this study, it also becomes apparent that neither group  <dig>   <dig> or 3d would be the deepest branch in a rooted version of the tree. such a tree would suggest that proteases within the groups 3b/3d developed before the proteases of group 3a and  <dig>  which seems far-fetched since proteases of group 3a and  <dig> type cleaves hydrogenases that are deeper branched then the 3b/3d hydrogenases.

we therefore suggest that the placement of hox-specific proteases  and the scattered result of 3b proteases in the phylogenetic tree may be the result of horizontal gene transfer . hgt is today seen as a major force in evolution and has occurred numerous times between archaea and bacteria  <cit> . within prokaryotes almost no gene family is untouched by hgt  <cit>  and there are also numerous cases of hgt within cyanobacteria  <cit> . -hydrogenases have not been spared from this mechanism and an archaeal organism is believed to be the origin of the ech- hydrogenase in thermotoga maritima  <cit> .

by comparing the phylogenetic tree of hydrogenases and their specific protease and assuming that the -hydrogenase and its specific protease have evolved together the most likely scenario is that an early group  <dig> -hydrogenase with or without its specific protease was transferred, most probably from an archaeal organism to a bacterial. if we assume that the type  <dig> hydrogenase and the protease transferred together then this indicates that most likely the root of the tree should be placed between group 3a and  <dig>  and that the protease transferred is the ancestor of all type  <dig>   <dig> and 3d proteases . if we assume the opposite, , then the root should instead be placed between type 1/2/3d and type 3a/ <dig> proteases  and the transferred hydrogenase must have incorporated an already existing type  <dig> protease to its maturation process. the scattered impression of type  <dig> and 3b proteases from the less robust phylogenetic tree with additional hydrogenase specific proteases  could be the result e.g. older phylum branching off close to the hgt point, poor resolution of the phylogenetic tree or by additional hgt and so does not contradict our proposed theory of hgt. rooting the tree with an outgroup; germination protease , the closest relative to the -hydrogenase specific proteases,  placed the root between group 3a and  <dig> suggest that the first scenario, a root between group 3a and  <dig>  is more plausible . however, all attempts at rooting the tree resulted in very unstable phylogenetic trees. when considering both gpr endopeptidase function  and taxonomic location  it is plausible that the -hydrogenase specific proteases are instead the ancestor of gpr, making any tree with gpr as outgroup unreliable.

based on the tree of life we also propose that the hgt of probably a 3b similar type protease/hydrogenase most likely took place before the diversification of the bacterial phylum and group  <dig> hydrogenases.  <cit> . by comparing our result with genomic timescales of prokaryotic evolution we can even suggest a time for the event of around 3– <dig>  billion years ago  <cit> . this is based on that the archaeal phylum and classes started to evolve earlier  then the bacterial  and the proposition that methanogenesis was one of the first metabolical pathways to be developed  <cit> . since group 3a-3b hydrogenases, have previously been shown to be connected to methanogenesis  <cit>  this data supports our suggestion of an early differentiation of group  <dig> hydrogenases. it should be noted that this proposed theory does not contradict previous suggestions of an early pre-luca existence and diversification of hydrogenases but rather clarifies the picture  <cit> . the effect this proposed hgt had on bacterial evolution is not clear but hgt in general may have had a significant effect on the diversification of bacterial species by introducing new metabolic pathways and traits  <cit> .

large-scale molecular genetic analysis of the dna sequence  could give a clearer picture however, because the hgt might have occurred more then  <dig> billion years ago mechanisms like amelioration will most likely have erased all evidence.

transcriptional studies of hupw in nostoc punctiforme atcc  <dig> and nostoc sp strain pcc 7120
it is interesting that hupw in both nostoc punctiforme and nostoc sp. strain pcc  <dig> are only or mainly transcribed under n2-fixing conditions even though it is not a surprising discovery. the same pattern has been observed for the uptake hydrogenase whose function has previously been connected to n2-fixing  <cit> . this suggests that the hupw proteases are under the same or similar transcriptional regulation as the hydrogenases they cleave. this expression pattern could be explained by the putative ntca binding sites in the promoter region of hupw in both nostoc punctiforme and nostoc pcc  <dig> . ntca binding sites have been found upstream of hupsl in gloeothece sp. atcc  <dig>  <cit> , nostoc punctiforme  <cit> , lyngbya majuscule ccap 1446/ <dig>  <cit>  and anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  <cit> , and putative binding sites have been observed upstream of the hyp-genes in nostoc punctiforme  <cit> .

the two putative ntca binding sites  identified upstream of the tsp of hupw in nostoc pcc  <dig> are imperfect when compared with the sequence signature of ntca   <cit> . these sites are therefore likely to have none or a very weak binding affinity to ntca and the two conserved regions observed downstream of the tsp may be the target of additional transcription factors. sequences similar to these conserved regions were also found in the intergenic regions of several other genes in nostoc pcc  <dig> and anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  and one of the conserved regions shows resemblance to an ihf binding site and the consensus sequence watcaannnnttr  <cit> . binding sites for ihf have previously been found in the promoter region of hupsl in nostoc punctiforme  <cit>  and lyngbya majuscula  <cit>  but have also been observed upstream of the hup genes in bradyrhizobium japonicum  <cit> , the nif genes in purple bacteria  <cit>  and the nif operon in anabaena azollae  <cit> .

transciptional studies of hoxw in nostoc sp strain pcc 7120
contrary to the hupw regulation, the result from the northern blot studies of transcript level on hoxw in nostoc pcc  <dig> showed only a minor difference between non n2-fixing  and n2-fixing conditions . considering the very small difference seen in transcript level the main function of the bi-directional hydrogenase and its specific protease indicate that it is not connected to n2-fixation. studies of the transcript levels of the bi-directional hydrogenase subunit hoxh, when shifted from non n2-fixing to n2-fixing  or to n <dig> limiting  conditions, shows either no effect  or very small effect . however further studies of the bi-directional hydrogenase activity in gloeocapsa alpicola actually showed significantly increased activity even though the relative abundance of hoxh  transcript did not change  <cit> .

conserved regions were identified in the promoter region of hoxw. the first region, containing a short tandemly repeated repetitive  sequence, has the ability to form a hairpin loop which is not unusual in filamentous cyanobacteria and has been found between hups and hupl in anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig>  nostoc pcc  <dig>  nostoc punctiforme and lyngbya majuscula ccap 1446/ <dig>  <cit> . in cyanobacteria they are usually made up of  <dig> bp repeats and even if their function is still not known they may be involved in increasing transcript stability or confer a translation coupling between genes  <cit> . hairpin structures in the dna sequence can also result in pauses during transcription or even act as a termination site  <cit> . the latter is a more likely scenario in this case since the putative hairpin is positioned close to the 3' end of the previous gene all <dig> , which is not co-transcribed with hoxw.

the second conserved region in the hoxw promoter region shows a strong resemblance to the consensus sequence rgtacnnndgtwcb of a lexa binding site  <cit> . lexa has previously been shown to bind to the promoter region of the hox-genes in synechocystis sp. strain pcc  <dig>  <cit>  and nostoc pcc  <dig>  <cit> , and the hyp-genes in lyngbya majuscula ccap 1446/ <dig>  <cit> .

specificity of hupw and hoxw in cyanobacteria
an alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of several groups of proteases revealed that one of the conserved regions found in hydrogenase specific proteases was replaced by a new, unique region in hoxw proteases , the so called hoxbox . this novel observation of a conserved group specific region may be an important finding for the understanding of the specificity and function of hydrogenase specific proteases. the function of this region in hydrogenase specific proteases has previously been under speculation with some suggesting that it functions as a catalytic site for the proteolytic cleavage  <cit>  and others that it is involved in substrate binding  <cit> . amino acid replacement, whereby asp <dig> in hyci in e. coli was changed to an asparagine showed no effect on the cleavage process  <cit>  which of course does not rule out that other parts of this region might be of importance.

in silico location studies of conserved surface residues of different proteases identified that the conserved amino acids are unevenly distributed on the surface and concentrated to certain regions . to find conserved residues around the proposed nickel binding amino acids glu <dig> and his <dig>  is to be expected considering the importance of these residues for substrate binding. interestingly, conserved residues were also observed around the hoxbox region and further on along alpha helix  <dig>  beta sheet  <dig> and alpha helix  <dig>  <cit> , especially in group  <dig> and  <dig> of the proteases. this could be due to their importance for the overall structure of the protein but could also indicate that these areas are involved in either cleavage function or docking between the protease and the large hydrogenase subunit. the latter theory coincides well with the result from the protein docking studies . the same areas that contain a high degree of conserved residues were in the docking result often seen in close contact with the hydrogenase. the protein docking results, performed with hydrogenases and proteases from several organisms, places the hoxbox alternatively the corresponding region continuously in unfavourable positions for c-terminal cleavage making its possible function as a catalytic site unlikely. added to the already mentioned observation that this region exist in two variations gt) it seems more reasonable it is involved in substrate binding and recognition and might even be important for the proteases specificity.

it should be mentioned that these protein-docking studies are mostly performed with 3d-models constructed through protein threading since no crystallised hydrogenase and protease exist from the same organism. even though the proteins used in this study are related, the sequence identities are sometimes low  but increases in the putative docking areas . the large subunit of the hydrogenase is also believed to exist in an open conformation, which probably makes the nickel associated to the active site of the hydrogenase accessible for the protease  <cit> . an open conformation could have an immense effect on any kind of protease-hydrogenase interaction but is with today's knowledge impossible to predict.

CONCLUSIONS
an understanding of the transcriptional regulation of hydrogenase specific proteases in cyanobacteria is starting to emerge. it suggests that the hydrogenase specific proteases in cyanobacteria are under very similar regulatory control as the hydrogenases they cleave. the two proteins also appear to have a close physical interaction during the cleavage moment, which could explain the specificity seen among proteases and the resemblance seen between the protease and the hydrogenase phylogenetic trees, and this interaction might be of very ancient origin. after comparing the phylogenetic tree of hydrogenases and their specific proteases we suggest that a group  <dig> hydrogenase spread through hgt to the bacterial domain, probably together with a hydrogenase specific protease indicating that the proteolytic cleavage first evolved within group 3a/ <dig> hydrogenases. we also propose that all 3d-type hydrogenases within bacteria evolved from this group  <dig> hydrogenase and therefore are the result of the same hgt event. finally the novel observation of the so called hoxbox may help in understanding the specificity seen among hydrogenase specific proteases and is an interesting target for further studies.
