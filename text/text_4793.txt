BACKGROUND
regulation of gene expression through genetic interactions, interconnected into complex networks, is crucial to the fitness of all organisms. these genetic regulatory networks are composed of several over-represented sets of interactions, called “motifs”, which are individually amenable to study  <cit> . many such studies are currently being conducted using synthetic gene network motifs in single-cell systems . such systems are highly advantageous from a practical point of view and often shed light on the dynamic behavior of network motifs. however, this research is unable to address the question of how these networks translate into inherently multi-cellular systems such as tissue patterning, stem-cell differentiation, cancer, and wound healing systems, each of which has a spatial component. this study seeks to address how a negative feedback motif behaves in space in the developing drosophila melanogaster embryo.

negative feedback loops in biology can result in a rich diversity of phenomenological behavior . under some conditions, negative feedback can destabilize the output of a system and create oscillations  <cit> . under other conditions, it may instead serve to stabilize the system against perturbations in the input signal. negative feedback acts in this manner to control tumor suppression genes in mice as well as pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells  <cit> . in a spatially-distributed system, the negative feedback that occurs when a morphogen activates its own inhibitor  may add robustness to downstream gene expression patterns . negative feedback can also be used to limit the range or length scale of a signal. this is occurs in the jak/stat pathway in vertebrates  <cit> .

here we create a spatially distributed synthetic gene network in the early drosophila embryo. we use the bcd 3’ utr to express the yeast activator gal <dig> in an anterior-posterior gradient . to create a negative feedback motif, we engineered a gal <dig> construct to contain three or five uas sites , which are activated by gal <dig> . gal <dig> binds to gal <dig>  preventing transcription of uas-linked genes  <cit> .

we found that, depending on the amount of gal <dig> and gal <dig> present in the embryo, this negative feedback system can exhibit either an attenuation or a shuttling phenotype, in which gal4/gal <dig> binding and diffusion can extend the spatial range of gal <dig> signaling . both mathematical modeling, as well as expression of the gal80-binder gal <dig>  validate our findings  <cit> . this work demonstrates how in spatial systems, gene networks can produce very different outputs depending on the relative spatial domains of inputs.

RESULTS
gal4-driven lacz expression has a graded border
a negative feedback network was created consisting of gal <dig>  gal <dig>  and lacz . we used a previously-published gal <dig> construct  and uas-lacz .fig.  <dig> effect of gal <dig> on lacz expression in attenuation situation. a

in these embryos, the synthetic gradient in gal <dig> activates the expression of the uas-lacz construct in a spatially-dependent fashion. using fluorescent in situ hybridization, together with image analysis protocols  we were able to quantify the expression domain of lacz .

we found that the expression boundary of lacz, resulting from the gal <dig> gradient, is not sharp, in contrast to previous work using this gal <dig> construct  <cit> . this difference may be due to the differences between in situ hybridization procedures using alkaline-phosphatase staining versus fluorescent detection.

gal <dig> expression attenuates lacz expression
next, to measure the effect of the negative feedback loop, we analyzed embryos containing all three constructs: gal <dig> , uas-lacz, as well as uas-gal <dig> . we tested two different promoter strengths for gal80: three or five uas sites were used. the expression profile for lacz with and without gal <dig> was analyzed to determine the effect of gal <dig> mediated negative feedback on lacz production due to gal <dig>  we found that the expression pattern of lacz is qualitatively unchanged . furthermore, gal <dig> expression is similar to that of lacz.

to determine the extent to which gal <dig> affects the lacz profile, we first compared the normalized intensity of lacz at each point along the anterior-posterior  axis when there is no gal <dig> present  to when there is gal <dig> present  . there was no statistically significant difference between the normalized intensity of lacz without gal <dig> and with gal <dig> linked to three uas sites along the entire ap axis. however, there is a difference  between the profiles for lacz without gal <dig> and with gal <dig> linked to five uas sites from  <dig> to 38 % embryo length and from  <dig> to 44 % embryo length; with the maximum difference at 29 % embryo length .

to compare the curves using a single summary statistic, we evaluated the ap position, xl, at which the lacz profile fell to 27 % maximal intensity. this level was chosen because it corresponds to the normalized intensity of the lacz profile with no gal <dig> at 29 % embryo length. as we found previously, with only  <dig> uas sites driving gal <dig> expression, no statistically significant effect on the lacz profile was observed, as compared to the system without gal <dig> .

from this analysis we are able to characterize the nature of the shift in lacz when uasx5:gal <dig> is present in the system. in this case, attenuation is observed and lacz expression was shifted toward the anterior pole  . at the same time a decrease in the standard deviation was observed . these two observations are indicative of negative feedback and demonstrate the ability of a simple negative feedback loop to reproducibly give rise to gene expression in a given spatial domain by buffering against minor biological and environmental fluctuations.

increasing abundance of gal <dig> creates a shuttling system
in order to increase the strength of negative feedback through gal <dig> we altered the copy number of gal <dig> and gal <dig> transgenes in this system. we considered the possibility that only weak negative feedback was seen due to a limited amount of gal <dig> protein. therefore, we tested whether increasing the amount of gal <dig> relative to gal <dig> would result in a greater effect of gal <dig> and enhanced control due to negative feedback on the system. we analyzed the lacz profiles in embryos carrying two copies of gal4-bcd 3’utr  and either one or two copies of uas-gal <dig> . we assume that two copies of the gal <dig> transgene results in double the potential gal <dig> protein synthesis rate. however, we do not assume that two copies of the gal <dig> transgene results in one-half the amount of gal <dig> protein loaded into the embryo, due to the gal <dig> transgene existing at two separate genomic loci.

as before, the uas-gal <dig> construct contained either three or five uas sites. to quantify the differences between these curves, we determined the point along the ap axis at which each curve passes 31 % maximal intensity . this corresponds to the normalized intensity of the lacz profile in embryos without gal <dig> at 26 % embryo length, or the position along the ap axis with the maximum difference between embryos without gal <dig> and with two copies of uasx5:gal <dig>  at a moderate gal <dig> to gal <dig> ratio , there was no discernible change in the lacz profile as compared to the no-gal <dig> control . however, at the highest gal <dig> to gal <dig> ratio, the lacz profile shifted away from the anterior pole , contrary to expectation .fig.  <dig> gal <dig> is able to create a shuttling system. a average curves of lacz mrna expression at the mid-saggittal plane in embryos with no gal <dig> , two copies of uasx5:gal <dig> , two copies of uasx3:gal <dig> , or one copy of uasx5:gal <dig> , from mothers with two copies of gal4gcn <dig>  individual curves for each embryo are shown with the average in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  b box plots of ap coordinate where normalized intensity is  <dig>  . asterisk denotes statistical significance . c difference between normalized intensity of lacz without gal <dig> versus with varying amounts of gal <dig>  dashed line denotes p =  <dig> 



one phenomenon that could be responsible for expansion of the lacz profile is facilitated diffusion or “shuttling” ). this “shuttling” would occur if gal <dig> binding to gal <dig> increases the effective diffusion of gal <dig>  this can occur if the gal4/gal <dig> complex exists preferentially unbound to the dna as compared to gal <dig>  which would result if gal <dig> destabilizes gal4-dna binding. the existence of this shuttling phenomenon was validated in a number of ways: using a model to demonstrate it is biophysically possible to switch between attenuation and shuttling in our system , adding a molecule to break-up this gal4/gal <dig> complex and create an effective sink for gal <dig> , and showing that shuttling is required to observe this increase in signaling when using this molecule to break-up the gal4/gal <dig> complex .fig.  <dig> a mechanistic model of gal4/gal80/gal <dig> interactions supports our hypothesis. a the model, when simultaneously fit to both the attenuation  and shuttling  data, is able to adequately satisfy both scenarios. the same parameter sets were used in both  and , with the only difference being that the levels of gal <dig> and gal <dig> are altered. the experimentally determined expression of lacz due to gal <dig> without gal <dig> is shown in yellow , the simulation fit to these data is shown in cyan . the expression of lacz after the addition of gal <dig> found through experiments is shown in magenta , the simulation fits to these data are shown in black . b when gal <dig> is added to the system, the model exhibits a similar phenotype as experimentally observed when the model is optimized for both attenuation and shuttling. the parameter sets here are the same as shown in . c when the model is fit only to the attenuation phenotype, the attenuation fit is better , but shuttling does not occur . d with parameter sets that resulted from an attenuation-only optimization, as seen in , the presence of gal <dig> does not result in a local increase in lacz expression. the parameter sets here are the same as shown in

a model of gal4/gal <dig> interactions predicts both attenuation and shuttling regimes
one question that arises is whether it would be biophysically possible to have a system in which gal <dig> attenuates the signaling range of gal <dig> at low gal80:gal <dig> ratios, but extends the signaling range of gal <dig> at high gal80:gal <dig> ratios. to answer this question, we built a mechanistic model of gal4/gal <dig> interactions. to simplify this model, we consider a lumped model for cytoplasmic, nuclear, and dna-bound gal <dig> and gal4/gal <dig> complex, and similarly lump cytoplasmic and nuclear gal <dig>  the effect of gal <dig> binding to gal <dig> has on the interaction between gal <dig> and the dna is accounted for in the diffusion term for gal <dig>  these equations are shown below. 0=λg2gxx−g−μgr−νc0=λr2rxx−r−βμgr−νc+qrfrg0=λc2cxx−ρcc+μgr−νc 

in these equations, g represents the concentration of gal <dig>  r the concentration of the repressor gal <dig>  and c the gal4/gal <dig> complex. at steady state, each component diffuses, is degraded, and participates in a reversible binding reaction with forward rate μ and affinity v. gal <dig> is produced by nuclei in which gal <dig> signaling, represented by the function fr , is sufficiently high. we assume no-flux boundary conditions for all species at both x =  <dig>  and x =  <dig> , except for a constant flux production of g at x =  <dig> .

the constant flux production of gal <dig> at the anterior pole is denoted by the parameter qg, which equals  <dig> for four copies of gal <dig>  and q2x for two copies. as mentioned above, because the copies of gal <dig> are at two different sites within the genome, we could not be sure that two copies of gal <dig> resulted in one half the production of gal <dig> protein as compared to four copies of gal <dig>  therefore, we investigated the behavior of the model for q2x between  <dig>  and  <dig> . we found that the model was better able to fit our data for lower values of q2x, so all results displayed are for q2x =  <dig> .

to fit our model to the experimental data, we first examined the case with no gal <dig> . we fit this version of the model to our data with no gal <dig>  and found adequate fits in both the attenuation case with gal4x <dig> ) and the shuttling case with gal4x <dig> ).

next, we fit our model to the data from embryos carrying gal <dig> . we performed this fit simultaneously  under two conditions: with qr =  <dig> and qg =  <dig> ) and qr =  <dig>  qg = q2x ). we found the model was able to adequately reproduce both an attenuated lacz profile in the gal4x4/gal80x <dig> scenario ), as well as an expanded lacz profile in the gal4x2/gal80x <dig> scenario ). this supports the plausibility of the hypothesis that the system performs attenuation for one dosage ratio and shuttling for another.

expression of gal <dig> in a stripe results in a peak of lacz expression
one prediction of the shuttling hypothesis is that forcing the local degradation or capture of the inhibitor  should result in a similarly localized peak in signaling activity. therefore, we introduced the yeast protein gal <dig> into the gal4/gal <dig> system. gal <dig> binds to gal <dig> and prevents the formation of the gal4/gal <dig> complex, thereby allowing gal <dig> to activate uas-linked genes  <cit> .

two different enhancer regions were used to create stripes of gal <dig> , namely gt <dig>  <cit>  and evestr <dig>  <cit> . as predicted by the shuttling hypothesis, the expression of gal <dig> in these domains causes a local increase in lacz production . this perturbation also causes a rapid decrease in lacz expression anterior to the gal <dig> expression domain. this is likely due to the increase in concentration of free gal <dig> within the gal <dig> domain at the expense of gal <dig> outside of this domain.

to control for the possibility that gal <dig> expression is causing uas-lacz transcription without gal <dig>  we examined embryos that carried two copies of gal <dig> and gal <dig>  but lacked gal <dig>  surprisingly, a small increase in lacz expression near the site of gal <dig> expression was also observed when no gal <dig> was present in the system . while the yeast literature does not suggest that gal <dig> interacts with gal <dig>  this increase in lacz expression  may be due to some previously unknown interaction with gal <dig>  however, gal <dig> has a more significant localization effect when gal <dig> is in the system, supporting our hypothesis that gal <dig> shuttles gal <dig> .

to confirm that increased lacz expression in the gal <dig> domains is explained only by the shuttling phenomenon, we extended our model to include the presence of gal <dig> . when the model is optimized to simultaneously fit both the attenuation and shuttling regimes , local gal <dig> expression can result in a corresponding local increase in lacz expression . note that, in addition to an increase in lacz output in the gal <dig> domain, the better-fit curves  also fit a secondary detail of our experimental data: a more rapid decrease in lacz anterior to the gal <dig> domain. these results show that a model in which gal <dig> shuttles gal <dig> is consistent with our gal3-induced lacz data.

next, we asked whether the shuttling phenomenon is required by our model to fit the gal3-induced lacz data. to answer this question, we fit the gal4/gal <dig> model to only the gal4x4/gal80x <dig> scenario ). this corresponds to setting the parameter x =  <dig> . note that, with these parameter choices that are optimized only for attenuation, and not for shuttling, our shuttling target simulation curves ) do not match the target data ). in this case, the presence of gal <dig> does not alter the lacz expression profile . this shows that the shuttling phenomenon is not only sufficient , but also necessary in order to match the phenotype observed in our experiments. taken together, our gal <dig> experimental results unambiguously support the presence of shuttling within our system.

discussion
a synthetic negative feedback network consisting of gal <dig>  gal <dig>  and lacz was expressed in the drosophila embryo. this experimental system was able to produce weak negative feedback, marked by attenuation, the shifting of expression of lacz toward the source of activation  and a lowered variability. when the copy numbers of gal <dig> and gal <dig> were altered, a shuttling system was created at a high gal <dig> to gal <dig> ratio. in this shuttling system, the lacz profile expands toward the posterior pole, away from the source of activation. shuttling has been found in other systems, and in some cases produces robust gradients from an initial broad morphogen signal . shuttling requires a diffusible morphogen and a shuttling molecule that forms a complex with, and thereby extends the spatial range of, the morphogen. in this case the shuttling molecule, gal <dig>  is activated by the morphogen, gal <dig>  a third molecule can be used which breaks up the shuttling molecule/morphogen complex, releasing the active morphogen. we were able to introduce gal <dig>  which results in an increase in lacz expression at the source of gal <dig>  this is caused by the freeing of gal <dig> from the gal4/gal <dig> complex. this provides further evidence for our shuttling system.

previous studies have found evidence for morphogen gradients which enhance their own degradation, this form of negative feedback is known as self-enhanced ligand degradation. in this system morphogens degrade at a fast rate where their levels are highest and at a slower rate farther from its source, increasing the signaling range for the morphogen. this has been found in wingless and hedgehog patterning in the drosophila wing, bmp signaling and dv axis specification in the zebrafish and xenopus embryos, wnt and egfr signaling systems in mammalian cells and drosophila embryos, and retinoic acid signaling in zebrafish .

parallels from these systems can be drawn to our synthetic system. from our synthetic system we can understand in isolation the mechanisms at work in these systems better. namely, how the simple negative feedback system is able to achieve both an attenuation and a shuttling system depending on the relative concentrations of components in the pathway. further quantitative studies of this system  would help uncover the precise mechanism for switching between an attenuation regime and a shuttling regime.

CONCLUSIONS
while shutting has only recently been proposed to explain the ability of certain morphogen gradients to be defined and achieve robust patterns, comparisons to other systems suggest that shuttling may exist in other negative feedback systems  <cit> . most importantly this work demonstrated a negative feedback system that is able to produce two very different outputs depending on the spatial domains of expression and relative amounts of these genes. this shows the complexity of gene networks in tissue patterning and other multi-cellular systems. while much previous work has been carried out to understand synthetic gene networks in single-celled systems, much care must be taken to extrapolate these findings into multi-cellular systems.
