BACKGROUND
repeated muscle contractions rely on motoneuron-driven variations in sarcoplasmic calcium though ryanodine receptor-mediated release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum  and the subsequent re-uptake of calcium via serca channels  <cit> . the observed magnitude of the rise in sarcoplasmic calcium varies between slow and fast muscle types, which suggests it may control the contractile characteristics of muscle fibres  <cit> . however, this relationship is not fixed and muscle fibre makeup in sr and contractile proteins demonstrates a certain degree of plasticity in response to contractile stimuli  <cit> . an important feature of repeated muscle work  is the specific increase in mitochondrial content; reflecting a compensatory strategy to meet the energy demand of fibres undergoing frequent rounds of actin and myosin cross-bridge cycling  <cit> . in the rat, the mitochondrial adaptations of exercised skeletal muscle are associated with a transition of myosin isoform expression towards a slow-twitch phenotype  <cit> . the observed transformation of muscle fibre types is associated with a chronic rise in sarcoplasmic calcium  <cit> , which implicates calcium-dependent biochemical pathways in the regulation of muscle plasticity.

the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases  are important transducers of calcium signals towards gene expression  <cit> . the calcineurin-mediated pathway has been shown to regulate expression of slow fibre type-related myofibrillar proteins  <cit>  and affects mitochondrial gene expression although calcineurin does not appear required for exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> . by contrast, camk activation has been implied to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> , type iia myosin heavy chain  expression  <cit>  and calcium re-uptake into the sr in slow type muscle fibres  <cit> .

however, the current understanding of the physiological role of camk holoenzymes in whole muscle is incomplete, as previous studies rely on short-term inhibition studies with pharmacological agents in single muscle fibres  <cit>  or the overexpression of a camkiv mutant which is not expressed in skeletal muscle  <cit>  and has lost its calcium-dependent regulation  <cit> . camkii is the main camk isoform in skeletal muscle. importantly, however, the effects of camkii on the expression of genes that underlie muscle plasticity have - apart from the study of the glucose transporter glut <dig>  <cit>  - not been addressed.

camkii operates as a hetero-meric phospho-transferase which can decode calcium transients through auto-phosphorylation at threonine- <dig> . threonine- <dig> phosphorylation of camkii is increased after acute exercise in rats and humans  <cit> , indicating that camkii is part of the signalling pathways integrating the effects of exercise on muscle structure and function . these findings emphasize that camkii activation is firmly associated with the regulation of the oxidative muscle phenotype with contractile paradigms  <cit> . this is corroborated by the concomitant increase in camkii and mitochondrial atp synthase expression with endurance exercise training  <cit> . however, the question remains to which extent contractile features, as shown by camk inhibition in vitro  <cit> , depend on camkii in vivo, and to which extent downstream effects of camkii-mediated calcium sensing would be differently affected between contractile muscle phenotypes  <cit> .

we hypothesized that the content of hetero-multimeric camkii controls the mitochondrial and contractile phenotype of skeletal muscle and that this would take place in both slow-twitch m. soleus  and fast-twitch m. gastrocnemius . we tested this assumption by assessing the effects of the co-overexpression of native alpha- and beta-camkii isoforms, with similar substrate specificity and structure as the skeletal muscle camkii isoforms  <cit>  on selected protein markers of the contractile and mitochondrial phenotype. additionally, the corresponding transcript response to high-intensity exercise in situ was measured along with functional characteristics of the targeted sol and gm muscles. because the muscles under investigation show fibre recruitment during self-initiated locomotion  <cit>  we assumed that the effect of camkii overexpression would manifest under normal cage activity without an imposed contraction protocol. control experiments were carried out to quantify the extent of muscle regeneration being associated with the selected electro-transfer method to produce overexpression from injected expression plasmids  <cit> .

RESULTS

α-and β-camkii co-overexpression shifts gene expression towards a fast phenotype with enhanced calcium handling
factorial analysis of the paired data revealed a main effect  of the co-overexpression of the native α- and β-camkii isoforms on the contractile parameters time-to-peak-twitch force  and half-relaxation-time  for the combined data from sol and gm muscle . in sol muscle alone, a trend for a shortened half-relaxation-time was identified. maximum twitch force and maximum tetanic force, and fatigability of tetanic force, did not differ between control- and α/β camkii-transfected gm and sol.figure  <dig>

we assessed the effect of α/β camkii overexpression on the levels of proteins associated with the acceleration of muscle contraction  and relaxation . this analysis was limited to sol, because of the higher transfection efficiency achieved in this muscle. we found that the expression of all three proteins, myosin heavy chain isoforms iia/iix, serca <dig> and anxv, was increased in sol muscle compared to contra-lateral control-transfected sol muscle .figure  <dig>

immunofluorescent signals in muscle fibres were also quantified in gm muscle. in this muscle, coxiv signal intensities did not differ as a function of α/β camkii overexpression , but a larger fraction of camkii-transfected than non-transfected muscle fibres demonstrated mhcii staining .

camkii signalling after paced contractions in situ
we investigated whether α/β camkii-transfected sol muscle retains responsiveness for contraction-induced camkii signalling. paced isometric exercise in situ increased threonine- <dig> phosphorylation of β camkii . concomitantly, muscle fibres with elevated camkii content demonstrated increased signal for pthr287-camkii . rt-pcr experiments demonstrated reduced transcript levels of mitochondrial factors  and serca2a immediately after high-intensity exercise .figure  <dig>

transfection affects muscle contractility
compared to non-transfected muscle, twitch force  and maximal tetanic force  were reduced and time-to-peak-twitch force  and half-relaxation-time  were prolonged in control-transfected muscle . when values were assessed separately for the two muscles, twitch force and maximum tetanic force were reduced in sol muscle with control-transfection. concomitantly, markers of damage  and regeneration  were elevated in sol muscle 7 days after transfection .table  <dig>

discussion
this is the first study that investigates whether increased camkii protein expression affects the skeletal muscle phenotype in vivo. transcript measures indicate that α/β camkii signalling down-regulates mitochondrial gene expression after high-intensity exercise . in contrast to our hypothesis, we did not observe altered expression of mitochondrial protein in α/β camkii-transfected muscle fibres of rats housed under normal cage activity . by contrast, twitch contraction and relaxation times were reduced in α/β camkii-transfected muscles  when major proteins of muscle contraction and relaxation, i.e. mhc iia/iix and serca <dig>  were increased . regarding contractile features and mhcii expression in transfected muscle  the effects of α/β camkii overexpression were comparable in the slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle under investigation. our results suggest that, in the context of muscle transfection, α/β camkii content regulates the expression of proteins involved in muscle contraction and relaxation, but not of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.

technical considerations
in order to assess the effect of an increase in camkii holoenzymes, we deployed gene electro-transfer with expression constructs for native α- and β-camkii isoforms with similar substrate specificity and structure as the skeletal muscle camkii isoforms  <cit> . camkii overexpression was confined to muscle fibres , in which camkii content was increased  <dig> - <dig>  fold compared to camkii content in non-transfected fibres. the latter possibly reflects the abundant β m isoform . immunodetection of the validated protein band for threonine 287-phosphorylated camkii  demonstrated that the introduced β camkii retained responsiveness for contraction-induced camkii signalling . the findings imply that the increased content of native camkii resulted in potentially higher camkii activity which is amenable to physiological regulation during muscle recruitment in vivo. it has been estimated that motor units in sol muscles of caged, but freely moving rats are active for 25-30% during a 24-hour period  <cit> . furthermore, rat sol is recruited during postural and slow running activity  <cit> . therefore, we expected transfected fibres in this muscle to be frequently recruited. we acknowledge, however, that muscle regeneration is inherent to the selected mode of transfection . this is of relevance for our finding that mitochondrial protein levels in α/β camkii-transfected sol muscles were unaffected because muscle regeneration decreases mitochondrial enzyme expression and activity  <cit> .

the identified reduction in time-to-peak-twitch force and half-relaxation time in α/β camkii-transfected muscles  support a role of camkii content in the regulation of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. the comparison to non-transfected muscle reveals that this contractile effect occurred on the background of reduced contractility with transfection-induced muscle damage and regeneration . considering the broad influence of muscle damage on myogenic processes and the expression of factors involved in excitation-contraction coupling  <cit> ; a number of factors are likely involved in correcting the detriment in contractility by the overexpression of α/β camkii. this potentially includes the calcium channels, serca <dig> and ryr, which control excitation-contraction coupling via calcium release and re-uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. in vitro and in isolated muscle fibres both channels are regulated by camkii-dependent phosphorylation . the characterisation of camkii-mediated phosphorylation was not the focus of this investigation. at present it is therefore unclear if camkii-dependent phosphorylation of serca and ryr played a role in decreasing twitch contraction and relaxation times in our experiments. rather we identify that correction of the detriment in time-to-peak contraction and half-relaxation time by α/β camkii overexpression was associated with altered expression of serca <dig> and selected factors involved in excitation-contraction coupling . the increased serca <dig> protein levels in sol were localised to muscle fibres that overexpress α/β camkii . the localisation of serca <dig> and anxv to the sarcoplasmic reticulum  <cit>  suggests that the decrease in half-relaxation time with α/β camkii overexpression involves adjustments within the sarcoplasmic reticulum of transfected muscle fibres.

by contrast we observed no effect of α/β camkii-transfection on maximal force production . regeneration has been shown to decrease specific force and increase the ratio of twitch force to tetanic force  <cit> . this detriment has been shown to last up to seven days after injury  <cit> . therefore, it may be that any increase in maximal force was masked by negative effects of transfection on characteristics that limit force production with contraction.

transfection of sol muscle is associated with the expression of myosin heavy chain iia  in type i muscle fibres  <cit> . in this regard it is of interest that α/β camkii overexpression in slow-twitch sol muscle further increased mhciia/x levels compared to control-transfected muscle  and that the camkii-transfected muscle fibres demonstrated an increased fraction of mhcii expression in sol  and gm muscle . the identified increase in serca <dig> and anxv content with α/β camkii-overexpression compare to the demonstrated influence of overexpressed native camkii on gene expression being associated with excitation-contraction coupling and hypertrophy in cardiac myocytes  <cit> . our findings are also in accordance with the results of allen & leinwand  <cit> , who demonstrated that the calcium-ionophore a <dig> increased mhciia promoter activity in c2c <dig> cells, which was attenuated by the camk inhibitor kn <dig>  this raises the hypothesis that an increase in sarcoplasmic calcium levels in injured muscle fibres enhances expression of the fast fibre type program, through a camkii-dependent mechanism.

in contrast to our expectations, we observed no increase in mitochondrial protein  and fatigue resistance  in α/β camkii-overexpressing muscles compared to control-transfected muscles. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating whether increased content of native camkii increases the expression of a mitochondrial protein in any tissue type. constitutively active camkiv increases mitochondrial biogenesis when overexpressed from an embryonic stage onward  <cit> , but this camk is not endogenously expressed in skeletal muscle  <cit>  and camkiv knock-out mice do not display altered muscle adaptation in response to training  <cit> . whether camkiv would have a similar function in skeletal muscle compared to camkii is questionable, since the two proteins have different substrate specificity and intracellular localisation  <cit> .

the results demonstrate that increased α/β camkii content is not sufficient to increase mitochondrial gene expression. we can therefore not rule out the possibility that camkii is required in conjunction with other signalling pathways for the response to exercise as shown before for the activity of a glut4-enhancer in mouse m. tibialis anterior  <cit> . in this regard, we identify that the reduced mitochondrial and serca <dig> transcript levels after high-intensity exercise in α/β camkii-transfected sol muscle  reproduce the reduced transcript expression within hour after high-load type of bicycle exercise  <cit>  which contrasts to the up-regulation of gene transcripts with low-load endurance type exercise  <cit> . this suggests that effects of regeneration on mitochondrial transcript expression possibly interact with insufficient endurance type stimuli in the α/β camkii-transfected muscle of the rats housed under normal cage activity.

CONCLUSIONS
our results support a role for elevated sarcoplasmic camkii content for accelerating muscle contraction and relaxation in regenerating muscle via effects that include the enhanced expression of fast myosin heavy chain and sarcoplasmic reticulum associated serca <dig> and anxv protein, but not in mitochondrial biogenesis. these observations in vivo are the first to point out a role for quantitative changes in this multi-functional calcium-dependent enzyme in control of the contractile muscle phenotype.
