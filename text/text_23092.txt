BACKGROUND
whole genome duplication  by polyploidy is a major driving force in the evolution of eukaryotes, particularly plants and fungi  <cit> . all flowering plants have undergone at least one round of wgd  <cit> . between 30-80% of species are currently polyploids  <cit> , while the rest exist as paleopolyploids  <cit> , having undergone a gradual process of “diploidization,” or reversion to a diploid state over evolutionary time. this process involves extensive genomic rearrangements, including the physical loss of a large fraction of duplicate regions, and the accumulation of mutations that distinguish the sequences of the duplicate ‘homoeologous’ copies and contribute to their functional divergence  <cit> .

many of our most important crop species are currently either autopolyploid, for example potato and coffee, or allopolyploid, for example pasta and bread wheats, oat, cotton and canola. allopolyploid plants often undergo major changes in genome structure and function induced by the “genomic shock”  <cit>  occurring when two divergent genomes combine. for example, newly formed synthetic wheats undergo changes in dna methylation and rapid, non-random elimination of up to 14% of genomic dna sequence, which differentiates the homoeologous chromosomes and fosters the transition to diploid-like meiotic behaviour  <cit> . in addition, newly formed hexaploid wheat lines are frequently unstable, leading to aneuploid plants with missing or extra chromosomes  <cit> . other major crops are paleopolyploids, including barley, maize and rice, whose diploid genomes have been reduced towards their ancestral chromosome number and gene content through removal of duplicate copies, called homoeologues or homoeoloci, in a process of fractionation. far from being a random process, genes are commonly removed preferentially from particular homoeologues, in a process termed “biased fractionation”  <cit> . this bias in gene densities between homoeologous subgenomes has been observed in several paleopolyploid plants including arabidopsis <cit> , maize  <cit> , brassica  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> .

a hallmark feature of polyploid genomes is rapid and novel change in gene expression, ranging from slight alterations in the expression of homoeoloci through to the complete absence of expression caused by epigenetic homoeolocus silencing  <cit> . studies of both natural and synthetic polyploids have shown that homoeoloci frequently make unequal contributions to total gene expression levels. for example, they may become differentially regulated in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> , in response to stress  <cit> , during development  <cit>  or during different stages of fermentation in yeast  <cit> . in allotetraploid plants of various ages, genes from one homoeologous subgenome, typically the less fractionated subgenome, make a greater contribution to the transcriptome, a phenomenon termed “genome dominance”. these include newly synthesized arabidopsis suecica <cit> , the natural allotetraploid tragopogon miscellus that originated within the last 80 years  <cit> , and allotetraploid cotton  <cit> , originating naturally 1– <dig> million years ago or synthetic   <cit> . genome dominance has also been observed in autotetraploid maize  <cit> , even though polyploidization occurred some  <dig> million years ago. however, it has not been observed in the more ancient plant tetraploidies, such as those in the arabidopsis or rice lineages  <cit> .

bread wheat  is an excellent model system for studying the long-term responses of plant genomes to polyploidy. it is also a vital crop to food security, accounting for almost 20% of the world’s daily food consumption  <cit> . hexaploid bread wheat evolved through two distinct interspecies hybridization steps, involving three diploid donor species each with  <dig> pairs of chromosomes. first, ~ <dig>  million years ago, tetraploid t. turgidum arose from hybridization between a wild diploid species closely related to extant t. urartu  and another unknown wild diploid species related to aegilops speltoides <cit> , called the b genome donor. the t. turgidum genome is symbolized by aabb. about  <dig>  years ago, hexaploid t. aestivum  arose from hybridization between cultivated t. turgidum and the wild diploid species a. tauschii . the  <dig> chromosomes of the large ~ <dig> gb bread wheat genome  <cit>  are therefore distributed in three diploid homoeologous sets , each comprising seven chromosome pairs. within each chromosomal group , each diploid chromosome pair  is largely homozygous due to the natural inbreeding of the polyploid wheats and does not recombine with its homoeologues   <cit> . thus, every bread wheat gene is potentially represented by at least six copies; there are three homoeoloci  carried on the three  homoeologous chromosome pairs, with each homoeolocus representing a diploid pair of homoeoloci.

since the diploid progenitors of wheat originate from a common ancestor, each trio of a, b and d homoeoloci in hexaploid wheat originates from a common ancestral gene. hence a simple null hypothesis would be equal expression of each homoeolocus, with a, b and d homoeoloci contributing mrna transcripts . there are two main reasons why deviations from this 1:1: <dig> ratio might be widespread. first, evolutionary divergence of homoeoloci may have caused changes in relative expression, from slight changes, to physical loss  of a homoeolocus. second, the complex successive hybridization and domestication processes that have shaped bread wheat may have influenced homoeolocus divergence, in particular the coordinate regulation of relative homoeolocus expression levels. in synthetic hexaploid wheat, differential expression of homoeoloci is rapidly established  <cit> , is stably inherited  <cit>  and is similar to the patterns observed in natural hexaploids  <cit> . some studies have also showed a parent-specific expression dominance in the synthetic allohexaploid wheat transcriptome, involving a biased contribution from the ab  genome parent  <cit> , though others have not detected any genome dominance  <cit> . these studies have been somewhat limited by the inability to discriminate gene expression from all three individual  homoeoloci. while the differential contribution from all three homoeoloci has been illustrated for a small number of individual genes  <cit> , little is known about the relative contributions of individual homoeoloci to wheat phenotypes on a larger scale, or about the existence of any discernible genome-wide patterns.

here we systematically determine the extent to which bread wheat genes retained in three homoeologous copies deviate from the null hypothesis of equal expression. this determination presents an intricate challenge. distinguishing expression of a specific homoeolocus from expression of other similar sequences is difficult, in part because the sequences of homoeoloci are very similar  <cit> . the wheat genome is also highly repetitive, having more than 80% repetitive dna  <cit> . so, in addition to three potential homoeologous copies of each gene, there may be multiple “paralogues,” here defined as similar loci resulting from gene duplication. such paralogues may be present on more than one chromosomal group . several strategies have been employed to assemble homoeologue-specific bread wheat sequences. these include approaches that reduce the sequence complexity, including the physical isolation and sequencing of specific chromosome homoeologues  <cit> , direct assembly of transcriptomic sequences  <cit>  and utilizing the sequence similarity between bread wheat subgenomes and those of its diploid progenitors  <cit> . in a recent landmark study, brenchley et al.  <cit>  accomplished direct gene assembly from wheat genomic sequences and assigned two thirds of gene sequences to their homoeologous chromosomes, based on sequence similarity with diploid species related to the progenitors of the a, b and d subgenomes.

here we describe a novel approach to understanding wheat gene expression patterns that combines wheat cytogenetic resources with next generation rna sequencing. this approach enables assessment of homoeologous gene expression for a sample of ~ <dig>  genes located on the group  <dig> and  <dig> chromosome groups. our study shows detailed global patterns of relative homoeologous contribution through homoeolocus-specific characterization of bread wheat gene transcripts. in particular, we find that reduction in complexity, through the mechanisms of homoeolocus loss, silencing and biased expression, is a major feature of wheat genome evolution.

RESULTS
alignment of reads from euploid and nullitetra wheat cdna libraries to a partial reference transcriptome
the hexaploid nature of the wheat genome permits the engineering of wheat lines lacking specific homoeologous chromosomes, lines known as nullisomic-tetrasomics   <cit> . in each nullitetra line, lack  of one homoeologue is compensated by an extra set of either of the remaining homoeologous chromosomes, thus restoring the hexaploid state. for example, n1at1b lacks chromosome 1a but has two sets  of chromosome 1b . the nullitetras have historically been used for determining presence of wheat genes on specific homoeologous chromosomes  <cit> , and we reasoned that, in combination with next generation sequencing, they could be used to develop a systematic understanding of the relative contributions of individual homoeoloci to overall wheat gene expression.

we therefore obtained mrna-seq datasets  <cit>  from non-normalized cdna libraries created from shoot and root tissues of the euploid bread wheat cultivar chinese spring, from which the nullitetra lines are derived  <cit> , from complete sets of chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> nullitetras, and from extant relatives of the diploid a  and d  genome donors, herein referred to as a and d genome diploids . in the then absence of a t. aestivum genome sequence, we exploited an extensive wheat ‘expressed sequence tags’  resource to construct a reference transcriptome sequence . we selected ests physically mapped to segments  of wheat group  <dig> or group  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . concatenating ests from chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> , we created a wheat group  <dig> and  <dig> partial reference transcriptome consisting of  <dig>  ests . since the mean length of these ests  was 455 ± 133 bp , the genes in our reference are representative of fragments of sequence transcribed from entire genes in their subgenome of origin. assuming the diploid wheat genome contains approximately ~ <dig>  genes  <cit> , this reference set represents ~5-10% of the total wheat gene content.

we next aligned our wheat rna-seq reads using novoalign software  <cit>  to the group  <dig> and  <dig> reference transcriptome, using a number of quality filters  to give high confidence read alignments, with a deep average coverage of 700x enabling gene expression analysis . on average these reads represented  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the total reads from each sample , a figure roughly comparable with the above estimation that the group  <dig> and  <dig> reference transcriptome represents ~5-10% of wheat genes.

homoeolocus-specific sequence analysis shows at least 45% of wheat genes are expressed from all three homoeoloci
we next developed a novel strategy for the direct detection of wheat sequence variants and their assignment to homoeologous chromosomes using nullitetra analysis . we implemented this strategy computationally using perl and visually using the integrative genomics viewer  <cit> . homoeologue-specific variants  are defined as single base differences between homoeolocus sequences, and candidate hsvs were therefore identified at nucleotide positions  in the reference sequence where  <dig> or  <dig> different bases were detected in aligned euploid wheat reads. true hsvs that were ‘diagnostic’  for a particular homoeologue were confirmed by the presence of the diagnostic base at a particular site in all nullitetra lines except for those lines lacking the corresponding homoeologous chromosome. for example, figure 1a illustrates a notional ‘a/t’ homoeologue-specific variant at the tip of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  where the a base is diagnostic for the a homoeologue, as distinct from the t base present on the b and d homoeologues. such ‘diagnostic’ sequences were used to infer the expression  of a particular gene on a specific homoeologous chromosome.

genes were called as expressed if they had at least one quality filtered mapped read in at least one euploid wheat sample and at least one nullitetra line. most genes in the reference transcriptome were expressed, both for group  <dig> chromosomes:  <dig> / <dig>   genes, and group  <dig> chromosomes:  <dig> / <dig>   genes . the majority of such expressed genes on chromosome group  <dig>  and group  <dig>  carry one or more hsvs  identified in the sequence reads from shoot and/or root tissues via nullitetra analysis. overall, there were  <dig> hsvs per kilobase of reference transcriptome, with an average number of hsvs per gene of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . there was only a very weak correlation between gene length and the number of hsvs . most variant sites were two-allele hsvs, although we did observe a low frequency  of sites with  <dig> homoeologue-specific alleles . this lower frequency of three-allele versus two-allele hsvs is expected because three-allele hsvs require two independent  mutations at the same site for their generation. intriguingly, we identified a significant deficit of d-diagnostic compared with a- or b- diagnostic hsvs  for genes on groups  <dig> and  <dig>  this deficit is more pronounced for group  <dig> compared with group  <dig> genes , though the reason for this difference is unclear. in addition, we observed an enrichment of b-diagnostic hsvs on chromosome  <dig>  but not on chromosome  <dig>  the reasons for these deviations in relative frequencies of homoeolocus-specific variants between the two chromosome groups are unknown.

we next combined hsvs co-locating within a region of gene sequence less than the  <dig> base pair length of an individual sequence read to produce haplotypes. figure 1b illustrates this process for be <dig>  a gene with  <dig> hsvs distinguishing three homoeoloci on chromosomes 5a, 5b and 5d. the boxed region shows three homoeologue-specific haplotypes defined by two a-diagnostic hsvs and a single b-diagnostic hsv. hence, three homoeolocus-specific haplotypes can be distinguished, despite the absence either of individual 3-allele hsvs or 2-allele diagnostic hsvs for all three homoeoloci. the homoeolocus-specificity of each haplotype is confirmed by its absence in the nullitetra line lacking the respective homoeologous chromosome and by its presence in all other samples , allowing estimation of the number of homoeoloci of an individual gene that are detectably expressed . for the majority of sequences, haplotypes in the diploids are identical to the corresponding homoeologous haplotypes in euploid wheat .

to assess the qualitative patterns of expression of wheat homoeoloci on chromosome groups  <dig> and  <dig>  we looked at genes expressed in both biological replicates of each tissue. there were  <dig>   such group  <dig> genes expressed in shoots  and  <dig>   such group  <dig> genes expressed in shoots . systematic analysis of homoeolocus-specific sequences allowed us to assign reads, i.e., expression, to specific homoeologous chromosomes. the vast majority of these genes were expressed from the same homoeologues in the two replicates and were selected for further analysis:  group  <dig> genes expressed in shoots  and  <dig> / <dig>   group  <dig> genes expressed in shoots ; see figure 3a). we discovered that at least 45% of such group  <dig> and group  <dig> genes whose expression was assigned to homoeoloci are unequivocally expressed from all three possible homoeoloci  in shoots and 872/ <dig>  genes  in roots; figure 3a). this figure is an underestimate because expressed homoeoloci are detectable only if expressed at sufficient levels and because homoeologue-specific sequences are required to distinguish homoeolocus expression. genes expressed from all three group  <dig> or  <dig> homoeoloci have a significantly higher total expression level than genes expressed from only one or two homoeoloci, in either shoots or roots . this is not surprising since genes expressed at high levels were preferentially retained and expressed from multiple copies after polyploidization in other species, including maize  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . however, it is difficult to confirm a similar effect in bread wheat, since genes expressed at higher levels will also have a higher probability for detection of all three homoeoloci by nullitetra analysis of homoeolocus-specific sequences in the rna-seq data.

genes expressed from all three homoeoloci are predominantly expressed from a single homoeolocus
having established that at least 45% of genes are expressed from all three a, b and d homoeoloci, we next determined the relative contribution of transcripts from each homoeolocus to total gene expression, to test the ‘a = b = d’  null hypothesis. while we could not be certain that each homoeolocus exists in single copy on each homoeologous chromosome, we could assess the relative contribution from each homoeologous subgenome. to do this we aligned reads using novoalign  <cit>  to a degenerative reference sequence . for sequence regions with exactly three homoeologue-specific haplotypes, for example those marked by arrows in figure 1b, reads with a, b and d sequences were quantified and compared using chi-square to a 1:1: <dig> expectation. regions with more than three haplotypes were ignored as they most likely contained additional sequence alignments from paralogous genes. over 93% of the haplotyped regions from all genes showed only two or three homoeologue-specific haplotypes , therefore extra sequence alignments from related genes did not significantly constrain our analysis.

genes expressed from all three homoeoloci in both biological replicates of a given tissue were classified into those not diverging from the ‘a = b = d’ null hypothesis versus those exhibiting differential expression . a minority of group  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed no sequence regions with evidence of differential expression at p < . <dig> and were classified as equally expressed from all three homoeoloci . this group included 225/ <dig> genes  in shoots and 206/ <dig> genes  in roots . this estimate of ~1/ <dig> of genes showing ‘a = b = d’ is almost certainly an upper bound, since the statistical power to detect differential expression is governed by the read depth, strength of differential expression and number of sequence differences between homoeoloci. genes displaying the ‘a = b = d’ pattern have reduced probability for detection of differential expression , due to reduced total read coverage or rpkm  compared to differentially expressed genes  and a lower per-site density of hsvs .

most genes showed evidence for differential expression of homoeoloci  in shoots, 666/ <dig> genes  in roots; figure 4a). these included all genes with quantified regions passing the p < . <dig> threshold. those passing a bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < . <dig> were called as significantly differentially expressed, while the remainder were only “suggestive” of differential expression and classified as “unknown” . we were interested in the diversity and frequency spectrum of different homoeologous expression patterns for genes with significant differential expression. differentially expressed genes were therefore sorted into all  <dig> possible categories :  <dig> patterns with three distinct levels of expression from each of the three homoeoloci, for example ‘a > b > d’) and a further  <dig> patterns with two distinct levels of expression, for example ‘a > b = d’. each pattern with three distinct expression levels ranks the expression of each homoeolocus and is ‘consistent’ with two patterns with just two different expression levels . for example, ‘a > b > d’ is consistent with ‘a > b = d’ and ‘a = b > d.’ we used a conservative approach to classify genes into each of these categories, requiring the same or a consistent pattern of differential expression in two biological replicates from the same tissue and a consistent pattern across sequence regions . for such genes, we combined the two replicates for analysis of the significance of differential expression in each tissue . for example, in figure 1d, be <dig> showed a ‘b > a = d’ pattern in roots for both replicates in both illustrated regions with three homoeolocus-specific haplotypes. this pattern was significant at p < . <dig>  with both replicates combined or individually . around half of genes expressed from all three group  <dig> or group  <dig> homoeoloci showed such ‘consistently biased’ patterns of differential homoeolocus expression in shoots  and in roots . the remainder were added to the “unknown” group of genes, which totalled 217/ <dig> or 26% genes in shoots and 249/ <dig> or 29% genes in roots . we observed highly similar homoeolocus expression patterns from the two replicates of each tissue, with less than 7% of ‘unknown’ cases in either shoots  or roots  caused by conflicting patterns of expression. note that while we do not focus on the expression of homoeoloci in the nullitetras here, figure 1c shows that for be <dig>  all the nullitetras except for n5bt5a show an expression pattern consistent with a dosage response to the extra copies of the ‘tetra’ genome. n5bt5a shows the opposite response, a negative dosage compensation in which the contribution from the ‘tetra’ genome  is lower than that of the other ‘diploid’ genome .

all twelve patterns of differential homoeolocus expression occur in both shoots and roots, though not with equal frequency . less than 10% of differentially expressed genes had three distinct expression levels  in shoots  or roots . this is an underestimate since these genes are expressed at significantly higher levels compared with genes having two distinct expression levels , which improves the statistical power to detect differential expression of homoeoloci. cases where one homoeolocus dominates expression , were significantly more frequent than cases with co-upregulation of two homoeoloci  . on average, among such cases, the predominant homoeolocus contributes ~55% of total expression, while the other two homoeoloci play a subsidiary role and supply the remaining 45% . a small number of genes exhibit extremely strong homoeolocus expression bias. for example, the group  <dig> gene bf <dig> encoding a predicted enolase shows ‘b > a = d’ in shoots, with an average of 86 ± 5% expression arising from the b homoeolocus . however, the extent of expression bias shows no clear relationship with the total gene expression level from all three homoeoloci .

there is no global bias for preferential expression of homoeoloci from a particular a, b or d homoeologous subgenome . in contrast, when two of the three expressed homoeoloci dominate total gene expression, there is a striking difference in the frequencies of the three possible co-upregulated pairs , with a and b homoeoloci significantly underrepresented compared with ‘a, d’ or ‘b, d’ combinations . however, we do not observe a similar deficit for the alternative pattern in which a and b homoeoloci are expressed at the same level  compared with either ‘b > a = d’ or ‘a > b = d’.

to explore the factors underlying differential homoeologous expression patterns in euploid wheat, we looked at the possible role played by biological function. we used the fatigo functional analysis tool  <cit>  to explore the relationship between biological function and homoeologous gene expression patterns. we found that genes expressed from all three homoeoloci in either shoots or roots were significantly enriched for only a single term, cellular component go: <dig> , compared with genes expressed from only one or two homoeoloci . however, we did not find any functional trends  to explain specific patterns of expression of homoeoloci .

we experimentally validated, using two independent approaches, our computationally determined homoeologue-specific variants , and the differential homoeolocus expression patterns observed in roots, for six genes expressed from all three a, b and d homoeoloci. first, semi-quantitative rt-pcr and second, pcr product cloning into a bacterial vector followed by sanger sequencing, using the same root rna samples used for rna-sequencing . all hsvs were validated for these six genes, giving a zero rate of false positives. some hsvs in the amplified sequences were missed by our nullitetra analysis strategy, with an average false negative rate of 18%. hsvs were missed for various reasons, including insufficient coverage across all nullitetra samples in the region of the hsv, absence of homoeologue-specificity in one or more nullitetras, or sequence divergence between chinese spring and est sequences, which originated from a variety of triticum species . all differential expression patterns were validated for each gene using one or both of these methods. therefore, our strategy can successfully determine the homoeolocus expression patterns of wheat genes using fragments of gene sequence, rather than full gene models.

similar patterns of differential homoeologous expression in two wheat tissues
we next determined the degree to which expression patterns for genes expressed from all three a, b and d homoeoloci are shared between shoot and root organs of the wheat plant, based on  <dig> genes expressed from all three group  <dig> or  <dig> homoeoloci in both tissues. a comparison of homoeolocus expression patterns was possible despite significantly higher average total expression levels in roots compared with shoots, of unknown cause . of the above  <dig> genes,  <dig> displayed either significant differential expression or equal expression of all three homoeoloci  from both tissues. 218/ <dig>  of these genes showed agreement, defined where both tissues showed either the same pattern of expression, or two ‘consistent’ patterns of differential expression . most disagreements  were cases where the three homoeoloci were differentially expressed in one tissue, but equally expressed in the other . for most such cases , the tissue showing equal expression also had lower coverage, suggesting that some of these disagreements may be false positives caused by the statistical difficulty in confirming differential expression of homoeoloci for genes expressed at low levels. of more interest are those  <dig> genes with conflicting patterns of differential homoeolocus expression . for example, be <dig> is a highly expressed uncharacterized protein similar to the arabidopsis gene tet <dig>  which shows a ‘b > a = d’ pattern in shoots but has a significantly higher contribution from the a homoeolocus in roots, showing ‘a = b > d’ . the biological relevance of these tissue-specific homoeolocus expression patterns warrants further investigation.

detecting the presence and expression of homoeoloci
the remaining ~55% of wheat genes on chromosome groups  <dig> and  <dig> were not detectably expressed from all three possible homoeoloci . such expression patterns may be generated by physical loss  of homoeoloci, absence of transcripts from a particular homoeolocus , and includes genes without diagnostic homoeolocus-specific sequences. distinguishing these causes is a challenge because lack of evidence for presence or expression of a homoeolocus on a particular homoeologous chromosome may not mean it is absent or not expressed. nevertheless, we proceeded to categorize the presence and expression of each gene based on several sources of evidence .

to infer presence of a gene on a particular homoeologous chromosome, we focused on group  <dig> chromosomes and combined three sources of evidence. first, the deletion bin mapping dataset of qi et al.  <cit> , which assigned genes to homoeologous chromosomes according to the presence or absence of a restriction fragment in southern blots from a series of aneuploid and deletion wheat lines  <cit> . second, nullitetra analysis of our shoot and root rna-seq data from euploid wheat and its derived nullitetra lines to identify transcribed homoeologue-specific sequences . third, the group  <dig> homoeologous chromosome specific dna sequence assemblies of wicker et al.  <cit> , generated by sequencing flow sorted chromosomes from double ditelosomic lines of chinese spring wheat . this dataset included assemblies from the short and long arms of chromosomes 1a and 1b, and from the long arm of 1d, but lacked assembled sequences from the 1d short arm due to chromosomal rearrangement in the corresponding wheat line. we identified matches for  <dig>  of our  <dig>  group  <dig> genes using blast comparison with our homoeologue-specific sequences. the absence of sequences from chromosome 1ds  <cit>  means we have most likely underestimated the number of genes present on the 1d homoeologue.

we discovered evidence for substantial gene loss during the evolutionary history of bread wheat . among  <dig>  group  <dig> genes, , we found  <dig>  genes present in three copies . there are more genes on chromosome 1b  than on 1a , which in turn exceeds the number present on 1d  . we estimate that most  homoeolocus loss events occurred after the two polyploidization events that created bread wheat. for example, there are  <dig> genes present on chromosomes 1b and 1d , but absent from 1a,  <dig>  of which are detectably expressed  in the a genome diploid. similarly,  <dig> genes are present on 1a and 1b but absent from 1d, of which  <dig>  are expressed in the d genome diploid.

widespread homoeolocus loss and silencing mean ~1/ <dig> wheat genes are expressed from only a single homoeolocus
for the majority of genes from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  we confirmed the identity of all expressed homoeoloci in both shoots  group  <dig> genes; 766/ <dig>   group  <dig> genes) and roots  group  <dig> genes; 793/ <dig>   group  <dig> genes), as indicated by the solid circles in figure 3c; see also additional file 15: table s <dig>  for the remaining genes, the identity of one or more homoeoloci was uncertain, as indicated by dashed circles in figure 3c. for example, genes with diagnostic sequences  for a single homoeologous chromosome  must be expressed from this chromosome, plus at least one other chromosome whose identity cannot be confirmed. genes present on more than one homoeologous chromosome and with no hsvs are likely to be expressed from a single indistinguishable homoeologue . we found that  <dig> / <dig>   of group  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed evidence for expression from the same homoeoloci in both shoots and roots, although a small number showed evidence for organ-specific transcript absence for one or more homoeoloci; additional file 17: table s8).

we observe frequent loss of expression  of group  <dig> homoeoloci . for example, among genes with evidence for the presence of three distinct homoeoloci, 12% appear to be expressed from only a single homoeolocus in both shoots and roots, while another 14% are expressed from only two of the three homoeoloci . overall, around one third of wheat genes are expressed from just one homoeolocus, having lost or silenced the other two copies  genes in shoots and 565/ <dig>   genes in roots; figure 3a). if homoeoloci are lost or lose transcription function randomly, genes expressed from two homoeoloci should be more frequent than those expressed from one. intriguingly, however, we found that genes on group  <dig> are significantly more likely to be expressed from just one homoeolocus than from two homoeoloci in shoots  and in roots . the same is true for group  <dig> genes expressed in shoots , though the difference is not significant at cutoff p < . <dig> for roots . we conclude that in terms of its gene expression, the bread wheat genome is tending towards diploidization in two ways; first, we estimated that only ~64% of group  <dig> genes are present in three homoeologous copies, indicating substantial gene loss has occurred . second, while there is still more than one homoeologous copy for at least 84% of group  <dig> genes , only 69% of these genes are expressed from more than one copy in either shoot or root tissues , which could indicate substantial homoeolocus silencing.

assuming we have correctly identified all present and expressed homoeoloci, we found a comparable frequency of genes showing physical absence  and transcript absence  of homoeoloci. in the absence of evidence for expression from a particular homoeologous chromosome, we identified cases of potential homoeolocus loss where there was no evidence for its presence, or of transcript absence where there was evidence for its presence. among  <dig> genes whose expression in shoots was assigned to one or more group  <dig> homoeologous chromosomes,  <dig>  have lost one or two homoeoloci, while  <dig> , have silenced one or two homoeoloci . similarly, for genes expressed in roots, 227/ <dig>  have lost one or two homoeoloci, while 201/ <dig>  have silenced one or two homoeoloci. we conclude that physical loss and transcript absence have both played an important role in the loss of homoeologous gene expression in hexaploid bread wheat.

b-subgenome homoeoloci contribute disproportionately to wheat gene expression
b subgenome homoeoloci not only exceed a or d homoeoloci in number but also contribute more to the bread wheat transcriptome . significantly more genes are expressed from b homoeoloci of groups  <dig> or  <dig> than from either a or d homoeoloci, both in shoots , b, d, chi-square, p = .046) and in roots , b, d, p = .036). among genes expressed from a single homoeolocus, significantly more are expressed from b  than from either a or d chromosomes , both in shoots  and in roots . it is possible that there are more genes detectably expressed from 1b and 5b homoeologous chromosomes than from a or d chromosomes due to a higher frequency of b homoeolocus-specific variants. indeed, it is plausible that b homoeologous chromosomes are more polymorphic than a or d chromosomes, given the differences in both mating systems and genome ages of the parental diploid species  <cit> ; the b homoeologous genome was acquired from a cross-pollinating species related to aegilops speltoides, while the a and d homoeologous chromosomes trace their origins to self-pollinating diploids  <cit> . however, this higher frequency of b-specific hsvs is not common to our entire dataset . we therefore conclude that b-genome homoeoloci tend to contribute more to wheat gene expression than do a or d genome homoeoloci.

a natural and long-standing question is whether a, b and d homoeoloci are equally likely to be transcript-absent  <cit> . it is possible that genes from particular wheat homoeologues have been preferentially silenced during polyploid evolution. contradictory evidence exists for preferential homoeologue silencing in wheat, with one study showing d genome homoeoloci to be silenced twice as frequently as a or b homoeoloci  <cit> , and others showing weak evidence for preferential silencing of d homoeoloci  <cit> , or indeed no preferential silencing at all  <cit> . here we focussed on genes with evidence for presence on all three group  <dig> homoeoloci, but detectable expression for only two homoeoloci . in shoots, there are more genes with a transcript-absent d homoeolocus  compared to transcript-absent b  or a  homoeoloci, though the difference was not significant. in roots, there were significantly more genes with a transcript-absent d homoeolocus  than genes with a transcript-absent b  or a  homoeolocus . most of the transcript-absent a homoeoloci  were expressed in the a genome diploid. similarly, most transcript-absent d homoeoloci  were expressed in the d genome diploid. while our results corroborate previous work demonstrating preferential post-polyploidization transcript absence for homoeoloci on the d genome  <cit> , it is nonetheless particularly unexpected given that the d genome was integrated into hexaploid wheat only ~ <dig>  years ago. the mechanism and reversibility of such transcriptional silencing are not well understood, and may involve methylation  <cit> , mutation in the promoter region, or other gene silencing mechanisms.

discussion
understanding the structure and function of the bread wheat genome is a major challenge, due to its complex evolutionary history of successive hybridization and allopolyploidization. in particular, it has remained unclear on a large scale whether the three ancestral diploid genomes contribute equally or differentially to wheat gene expression, and hence to wheat phenotypes. our study explores this question in detail, using an extensive, systematic approach for dissecting the relative contributions of the three potential homoeoloci  to total wheat gene expression.

several studies on the differential expression of homoeoloci in wheat have focussed on the expression of a relatively small number of genes  <cit> . subsequent genome-wide assessments have so far used microarrays, which are difficult to interpret for the expression of closely related genes  <cit> . such studies have therefore been unable to separate the contributions of individual homoeoloci, particularly the a and b homoeoloci originating from the parental tetraploid species. here we have developed a novel analysis of euploid bread wheat and its derived nullisomic-tetrasomic lines bearing specific chromosome substitutions. using high coverage rna-sequencing, we have successfully distinguished gene transcripts from all three hexaploid wheat homoeoloci . this direct approach alleviates the issue of chimeric sequence assembly encountered in previous work  <cit> , for genes on those chromosome groups for which nullitetra sequences are available . this allowed direct quantification of gene transcripts for which homoeolocus specificity was established.

combining our rna-seq data with published deletion bin mapping data  <cit>  and chromosome arm-specific assemblies of group  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> , we have assessed the physical distribution and expression of a sample of  <dig>  wheat genes present on groups  <dig> and  <dig> of the seven homoeologous bread wheat chromosome groups. we estimate that at least 45% of genes are expressed as three distinct homoeoloci  in both shoot and root tissues, as would be expected based on the hexaploid nature of the wheat genome. the majority of such genes display a biased pattern whereby the output of a single homoeolocus dominates total gene expression. similar studies of other allopolyploids including oilseed rape  <cit> , and cotton  <cit> , have also shown that genomically biased expression is common across a range of vegetative and floral tissues. in addition, all possible patterns of biased homoeolocus expression occur from various genes and tissues, consistent with our results, which show all twelve possible patterns of differential expression from three wheat homoeoloci. previous work on polyploid wheat  <cit>  and cotton  <cit> , and on diploid arabidopsis <cit> , has shown frequent cell type-specific homoeolocus  expression patterns. perhaps surprisingly, we uncovered limited evidence for contrasting patterns of differential expression between homoeoloci in two wheat tissues. extending our work to the expression analysis of specific cell-types, developmental stages or growth environments would likely show more variation in the expression of homoeoloci. our analysis strategy involves simultaneously identifying homoeologue-specific variants and quantifying their contribution to the transcriptome. as such, it has focused on genes that are highly expressed and highly polymorphic. it is possible that the expression of homoeoloci is more variable for such genes. as the international wheat community continues to make rapid progress towards completion of an annotated reference wheat genome sequence  <cit> , we will in the future be able to assess the generality of the patterns we have observed here for all wheat genes, including those expressed at low levels and those with subtle or highly skewed expression of homoeoloci.

genes expressed from all three homoeoloci in either tissue were enriched for the mitochondrion cellular component go term. this supports a key role for mitochondria in providing hexaploid wheat with more efficient energy-generating mechanisms than its diploid and tetraploid relatives  <cit> . however, there were no functional trends  to explain specific patterns of expression of homoeoloci . this may be due to insufficient statistical power, but it is also consistent with recent work  <cit>  showing that while the gene expression pattern itself is heritable, the identity of genes showing various patterns can be highly stochastic and involve diverse gene functions. we did not find any global bias towards preferential expression of homoeoloci from a particular homoeologous subgenome, for those genes expressed from all three homoeoloci. in contrast, bias in favour of d genome homoeologues has been reported in five cotton species  <cit> . in addition, the transcriptomes of two resynthesized hexaploid wheat lines contained more genes showing tetraploid parental dominance than diploid parental dominance  <cit> , though the contributions of a and b homoeoloci could not be separated. observations in other polyploid species, including cotton  <cit> , oilseed rape  <cit>  and spartina <cit> , suggest there are both immediate and long term alterations in homoeologous gene expression patterns after polyploidization. we propose that the biased patterns of homoeolocus expression we observed are attributable to coordinated  divergence in the regulation of individual homoeolocus expression levels following polyploidization. this possibility is strengthened by our observation that in cases where two homoeoloci equally dominate total gene expression, dominance of a and b homoeoloci is less likely than dominance of a and d or b and d homoeoloci. this may reflect the fact that a and b genome homoeoloci have been associated in bread wheat  for ~ <dig>  million years, whilst d genome homoeoloci were only incorporated ~ <dig>  years ago.

we estimate that around 55% of wheat genes are no longer expressed from all three potential a, b and d homoeoloci, due to both extensive homoeolocus loss and extensive transcript-absence of homoeoloci. homoeolocus loss has been extensive since only 64% of genes exist in a, b and d copies. this result is consistent with wheat whole-genome sequencing  <cit> , which showed most wheat genes with orthologous copies in related cereals have between one and five copies, with a peak of two copies. in addition, assembly of sequences from wheat chromosomes 7a, 7b and 7d showed that 54% of genes remain present on all three homoeologues  <cit> . we also observed more b homoeoloci compared with a or d homoeoloci, supporting earlier observations based on bin mapping data  <cit> . this is likely to reflect, in part, the accumulation of non-syntenic genes on the 1b homoeologue  <cit> , as well as differential loss of homoeoloci from particular homoeologous chromosomes, which is commonly observed in paleopolyploid species  <cit> . this enrichment for b homoeoloci was not detected in the genome-wide analysis of wheat gene assemblies  <cit> , perhaps due to poor discrimination of b genome homoeoloci. a different pattern has been observed for genes on group  <dig> chromosomes, with homoeolocus loss greater from chromosomes 7a and 7b than from chromosome 7d  <cit> , which was attributed to two rounds of gene fractionation following polyploidization during the evolutionary history of bread wheat. the causes of these differences are unknown and might involve chromosome group-specific patterns of homoeolocus presence/loss.

in both shoot and root tissues, an unexpectedly high proportion  of all genes appear to be expressed solely from a single homoeolocus and we have no reason to believe this does not apply to all wheat tissues and to genes on chromosome groups other than  <dig> or  <dig>  among genes present in three copies , 26% have silenced one or more homoeoloci, which agrees well with a previous estimate of 29% of genes in the established hexaploid  <cit> . in a study of synthetic wheat, only 5% of genes showed evidence for homoeolocus silencing, suggesting that wheat homoeoloci are silenced gradually. overall, our results show that the bread wheat genome has undergone extensive “diploidization”  <cit> . this is a particularly interesting finding in the light of other observations. for example, hexaploid wheat can tolerate at least a ten times higher mutation rate  than diploid wheat  <cit> , which has made hexaploid wheat particularly well suited for tilling . this is usually explained by the redundancy provided by homoeoloci in the hexaploid genome  <cit> . the fact that nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of wheat can be produced exhibiting only minor phenotypic effects  <cit>  further testifies to the buffering effects of polyploidy. this could be explained at least in part by the reversibility of gene silencing, as demonstrated previously  <cit> , and by the duplication of homoeologues across more than a single chromosomal group.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis strategy we have developed should be of great use for the assembly of homoeologue-specific sequences in wheat genome and transcriptome sequencing projects. wheat displays substantial levels of variation at the phenotypic, genetic and epigenetic levels, which is of paramount importance to wheat breeding. our work gives a comprehensive understanding of the homoeolocus expression patterns characteristic of bread wheat genes, providing a key stepping-stone towards understanding the relationship of wheat variation with differential homoeolocus expression patterns. in addition, the observation that bread wheat is tending towards functional diploidy has important practical implications for the strategies employed by breeders in the development of improved wheat strains.
