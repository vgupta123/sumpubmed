BACKGROUND
cations are essential macro- and micronutrients in plants, playing critical roles in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, disease resistance, osmotic equilibrium, growth, and development . although required for normal cellular functions, an imbalance of cations can cause deleterious effects in plants. to regulate intracellular cation homeostasis, plants have evolved several distinct classes of transporters to facilitate the movement of monovalent and divalent cations across cellular membranes. one such class of cation transporters is the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels   <cit> .

originally discovered in barley  <cit>  and subsequently found in many plant species  <cit> , cngcs share a shaker-like structure composed of six membrane-spanning domains  with a pore situated between s <dig> and s <dig>   <cit> . the hydrophilic c-terminus contains partially overlapping cyclic nucleotide-binding  and calmodulin-bind  domains  <cit> . cyclic nucleotides  are believed to activate, whereas calmodulin inhibits cation transport  <cit> . the cngc family in arabidopsis is comprised of  <dig> members  <cit> . electrophysiological, molecular and genetic complementation studies of six of these members indicate that they are generally non-selective, monovalent and divalent cation channels  <cit> , although some discrimination between cations has also been observed  <cit> . the phenotypic characterization of loss-of-function mutants has implicated cngcs to be involved in a wide range of plant processes  <cit>  including tolerance to heavy metals  <cit> , sensitivity to various cation stresses  <cit> , plant development and germination  <cit> , programmed cell death, and disease resistance  <cit> .

studies on cngc localization have lagged behind the biochemical, electrophysiological and genetic investigations of cngc activity. cell disruption and fractionation experiments indicate that the tobacco homolog, ntcbp <dig>  is associated with the plasma membrane  <cit> . when transiently expressed, atcngc3-gfp fusion proteins were detected in the outer region of the leaf protoplast  <cit> , also suggesting that atcncg <dig> is targeted to the plasma membrane. however, no cngcs have been immunolocalized at the electron microscope level of analysis and no data exists on their intracellular trafficking in plants. the latter point is also important because the pathway by which membrane proteins are transported to the plasma membrane in plants are not fully understood  <cit> .

to determine where different cngcs function in plant cells and to elucidate their intracellular trafficking mechanism, we have analyzed the expression of atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> and determined at high spatial-resolution the subcellular localization and trafficking of atcngc <dig>  atcngc <dig> plays an important role in numerous growth responses in plants  <cit> . it also modulates potassium levels in tissues, and it can rescue potassium uptake mutants of e. coli, yeast and arabidopsis on low potassium media  <cit> . in this report, combined approaches of atcngc10-gfp targeting and immunofluorescence and electron microscopy of the native protein were used to show that atcngc <dig> is present in the plasma membrane of a variety of cell types in roots and leaves. we have also localized atcngc <dig> to the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, golgi stacks and vesicles, and vesicles near the plasma membrane, consistent with the notion that this transporter is synthesized in the er and transported via the golgi to the plasma membrane. finally, patch clamp assays of hek <dig> cells heterologously expressing the atcngc10-gfp fusion indicated that the atcngc <dig> channel transported k+.

RESULTS
to study the location of cngcs within the cellular membranes of arabidopsis, we chose a combination of cngc-gfp targeting and immunological approaches. affinity purified, atcngc5- and atcngc10-specific polyclonal antisera were generated against synthetic peptides derived from the unique sequences of less conserved sub-regions within the cngc family. the corresponding positions of these peptides within the predicted two-dimensional structure of a representative generic cngc are shown . the atcngc10-specific antiserum binds to the hydrophilic n-terminus just upstream from the first transmembrane domain, while the atcngc <dig> antiserum binds to an exposed outer loop between the fifth transmembrane domain and the pore . the specificity of the atcngc10-specific antiserum has been characterized in detail against recombinant atcngc <dig> and native plant proteins on immunoblots  <cit> . the specificity of the atcngc <dig> antiserum was determined here .

the expression levels of atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> were assessed in mature leaves and roots using both real-time rt-pcr  and immunoprecipitation of total cellular proteins . the abundance of atcngc <dig> mrna was similar in roots and leaves, whereas atcngc <dig> mrna levels were over  <dig> -fold greater in roots. in addition, atcngc <dig> mrna levels were 3-fold higher than that of atcngc <dig> in leaves and 20% higher in roots. in our immunoprecipitation experiments, the atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> antisera detected specific bands at  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively , which corresponded to the predicted sizes of the deduced polypeptides. consistent with our real time rt-pcr results, atcngc <dig> was more abundant than atcngc <dig> in both tissues. generally, cngc protein levels correlated with mrna levels on an equal protein loading basis and using equal antibody dosages  in the immunoprecipitation assay.

as an initial approach for localizing cngcs within the cell, we employed transient expression of an atcngc10-gfp fusion controlled by the 35s camv promoter in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . the atcngc <dig> sequence directed gfp to the plasma membrane, whereas the gfp-alone control was detected uniformly in the cytosol . the atcngc10-gfp construct also lightly labeled some diffuse as well as several distinct punctate intracellular structures . these results suggested that the atcngc <dig> sequence directed the fused gfp through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. in another study, some similar structures were also reported to be labeled with atcngc3-gfp  <cit> .

to confirm the results obtained with the atcngc10-gfp fusion construct, we conducted immunolocalization experiments to determine the localization patterns of native cngc proteins in cells. immunolabeling at the light microscopy level was performed on chemically fixed wild type leaf protoplasts using the anti-atcngc <dig> and anti-atcngc <dig> antisera  and an alexafluor488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antiserum. fluorescence was specifically detected around the outer fringe of the protoplast coincident with the plasma membrane . however, to obtain a strong signal with the atcngc <dig> required  <dig> min longer incubations with the anti-atcngc <dig> antiserum than with the anti-atcngc <dig> antiserum, possibly to allow for the antisera to penetrate the protoplast to access the epitope on the cytosolic side of the membrane. the negative controls consisted of incubation of fixed protoplasts with the alexaflour488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody alone, which produced no signal, indicating that the immunolocalizations of anti-atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> to the plasma membrane resulted from primary antibody localization and not background binding of the secondary antibody.

the evidence of atcngc10-gfp targeting  and immunofluorescence localization of both atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> to the plasma membrane in protoplasts  prompted us to conduct further experiments using electron microscopy of high pressure frozen leaves to obtain higher resolution immunolocalization data . unfortunately, the atcngc <dig> antiserum proved problematic on high pressure frozen and acetone-substituted thin tissue sections. however, the atcngc <dig> antiserum gave very specific and clean labeling of the plasma membrane of epidermal , palisade parenchyma  and spongy mesophyll cells . slight plasmolysis of the epidermal cells  resulted in an increased separation of the plasma membrane from the cell wall, which further highlighted the specificity of immunolabeling in the plasma membrane.

atcngc <dig> was also detected in the plasma membrane of various cell types within the root tip . labeling was especially high in the cells of the meristematic zone , columella cells  and the root cap . the detection of atcngc <dig> in the plasma membrane of the gravity-sensing columella cells was especially interesting. we have previously shown that roots from the antisense lines of atcngc <dig> are impaired in their response to gravity compared to wild type controls  <cit> . we suggest that the effects of atcngc <dig> on root gravity response could be mediated by cation transport across the plasma membrane of columella cells.

to identify all of the intracellular structures containing atcngc <dig>  we have further analyzed immunogold labeled thin sections of high pressure frozen root tip cells using the anti-atcngc <dig> antibody. immunogold particles were observed over er cisternae , golgi stacks and emerging trans-golgi vesicles , secretory vesicles  and vesicles merging with the plasma membrane . this labeling pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that atcngc <dig> is synthesized by er-bound ribosomes, passaged through the golgi and transported in secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, which is a pathway that is postulated to be followed by most plasma membrane proteins in plants  <cit> . in addition, anti-atcngc <dig> labeling was also observed in the plasma membrane over late stage cell plates in dividing cells  and near cortical microtubule attachment sites . the delivery of atcngc <dig> to cell plates in the state of formation suggests, furthermore, that this ion transporter is of fundamental importance to plasma membrane function in dividing root tip cells.

the overall labeling of the anti-atcngc <dig> antibody over leaf and root cells roots was quantitated on a per cell basis . labeling was four-fold higher in cap, meristem and columella cells of roots than xylem cells of roots. this suggests that atcngc <dig> was not a major channel for cation loading of xylem cells in roots. likewise, labeling over leaves was on average one-fourth the level of labeling in root tip cells. the higher abundance of atcngc <dig> labeling in roots relative to leaves was in agreement with the expression analysis , and suggests that atcngc <dig> plays a more predominant role in roots.

to test for the ability of atcngc <dig> to mediate k+ transport in an independent heterologous system, we transiently expressed atcngc10-gfp in hek <dig> cells . atcngc10-gfp distinctly labels the periphery and some endomembrane structures of the hek <dig> cell, whereas gfp alone labels the cell somewhat uniformly. immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the two constructs were expressed and that atcngc <dig> was fused to gfp based on the predicted size on sds-page. in patch clamp assays, we observed that heterologously expressed atcngc <dig> conducted significant inward k+ currents with the application of dibutyryl cgmp  in the extracellular recording solution, demonstrating the activation of these channels  <cit> . we also observed significant outward currents, which may be carried by n-methyl-d-glucamine, a large organic cation, through the atcngc <dig>  further work is therefore needed to characterize the selectivity of atcngc <dig> for small and large cations and the role of calmodulin and cyclic nucleotides in channel regulation.

the ability of atcngc <dig> to rescue e. coli and yeast mutants defective in k+ transport  <cit> , combined with the plasma membrane localization of atcngc <dig> in a variety of cells and cation transport in heterologous hek <dig> cells shown here, is consistent with its role in regulating cellular expansion through k+ transport  <cit>  via the acid growth mechanisms  <cit> . antisense knockdown lines of atcngc <dig> had smaller parenchyma cells and leaves and were disrupted in rates of root growth and gravitropic bending  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to propose that atcncg <dig> is involved in cation uptake in the plasma membrane of root and leaf cells. in addition, atcngc <dig> may also be involved in cation transport across the membrane of the vesicles in which it was detected. the inability to isolate a true knockout of atcngc <dig> and the observed haploinsufficiency  <cit> , combined with the cell biological data observed here, further support our contention that atcngc <dig> is an essential gene in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
atcngc <dig> is equally expressed in roots and leaves, while atcngc <dig> is expressed preferentially in roots. both channels were localized to the plasma membrane of leaf protoplasts using immunofluorescence microscopy, and the translational fusion between atcngc <dig> and gfp also localized to the plasma membrane, indicating that it targets through the secretory pathway. high-resolution immunogold labeling at the em level demonstrated that atcngc <dig> resides in the plasma membrane of root tip, columella, and meristematic cells, as well as in leaf epidermal, mesophyll and palisade parenchyma cells. atcngc <dig> was found in the er, golgi and vesicles, and we propose that these vesicles are trafficking intermediates in the secretory pathway for plasma membrane proteins. atcngc <dig> most likely transports cations into actively growing cells of leaves and roots and the gravity-sensing columella cells of roots.
