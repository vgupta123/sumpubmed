BACKGROUND
the degree of specialization of plants or animals has been studied and debated extensively, and a continuum from complete specialization to full generalization can be found in various systems  <cit> . in general, two levels of specialization measures may be distinguished: first, the characterization of focal species and, second, the degree of specialization of an entire interaction network, representing an assemblage of species and their interaction partners . when interactions are considered as ecological niche, the first level describes the niche breadth of a species and the second level the degree of niche partitioning across species. while the species level is more straightforward in its biological interpretation, analyses at the network level can be useful for comparisons across different types of networks. such analyses have been performed to compare plant-pollinator webs versus plant-seed disperser webs  <cit> , different plant-pollinator networks along geographic gradients  <cit> , or food webs of variable size  <cit> . entire network analyses are also used to study patterns on a community level such as coevolutionary adaptations  <cit> , ecosystem stability or resilience  <cit> .

quantifying specialization at the species level
specialization or generalization of interactions are most commonly characterized as the number of partners , e.g. the number of pollinator species visiting a flowering plant species or the number of food plant families a herbivore feeds upon. in this qualitative approach, interactions between a consumer and a resource species are only scored in a binary way as 'present' or 'absent', ignoring any distinction between strong interactions and weak or occasional ones. for example, binary representation of interactions do not distinguish a scenario where 99% of the individuals of a herbivore species feed on a single plant species only, but occasionally an individual is found on another plant, from a different scenario where a herbivore regularly feeds on both food plants. the problem is analogous to the measurement of biodiversity either as a crude species richness versus as a more elaborate diversity index including relative abundances  <cit> . several approaches have thus been used to directly include variation in interaction frequencies  in characterizing the diversity of partners, e.g. simpson's diversity index for pollinators  <cit>  or lloyd's index for host specificity  <cit> . alternatively, other studies indirectly controlled for abundance or sampling intensity using rarefaction methods  <cit> . correspondingly, bersier and coworkers  <cit>  have suggested to quantify the diversity of biomass flows in food webs using a shannon diversity measure. niche breadth theory provides several additional indices that include some measure of resource frequency or resource use intensity  <cit> , which can be viewed in analogy to 'partner diversity' in the context of association networks. however, hurlbert  <cit>  emphasized that not only proportional utilization, but also the proportional availability of each niche should be taken into account. a species that uses all niches in the same proportion as their availability in the environment should be considered more opportunistic than a species that uses rare resources disproportionately more. if variation in resource availability is large, diversity-based measures that ignore this availability may be highly misleading  <cit> . several niche breadth measures thus combine proportional resource utilization with proportional resource availability  <cit> . these concepts have been rarely applied in the context of species interaction networks, e.g. plant-pollinator webs where binary data are more common than quantitative webs.

quantifying specialization at the community level
the measurement used most commonly to characterize community-wide specialization is the 'connectance' index   <cit> . c is defined as the proportion of the actually observed interactions to all possible interactions. consider a contingency table showing the association between two parties, with r rows  and c columns . connectance is defined as c = i/, with i being the total number of non-zero elements in the matrix. therefore, like the number of partners or links  described above, c uses only binary information and ignores interaction strength. c is directly related to the mean number of links  of plant species or pollinator species as c = l¯

analyses based on binary data – both at the species and the community level – have obvious shortcomings, since they are highly dependent on sampling effort, decisions which species to include or not, and the size of investigated networks. several authors thus emphasized the need to move beyond binary representations of interactions to quantitative measures involving some measure of interaction strength  <cit> . a way to at least partly overcome these deficiencies is to cut off all rare species or weak interactions below a frequency threshold  <cit>  or to control for sampling effort in null models  <cit> . however, for interaction webs where a more detailed information is available, simplification to binary data as in c or l¯

a severe additional problem of connectance is that its lower and upper constraints are not scale-invariant  <cit> , which limits its use for comparisons across networks. the minimum possible value  to maintain at least one link per species declines in a hyperbolic function with the number of interacting species, since cmin = max/, and an upper limit  may be constrained by, or a function of, total sampling effort. across networks, c decays strongly with network size, which has been debated in detail in the context of food web analysis  <cit> . the strong relationship between c and network size generates a problem for disentangling any biologically meaningful effect from this mathematically inherent scale dependence. for instance, network comparisons may focus on residual variation in c after an average effect of network size has been controlled for  <cit> , or c could be rescaled to account for this size effect . for natural networks of similar size, the range of actual c values is typically very narrow  <cit> , thus other structural forces may be poorly detectable.

the objective of this paper is to develop and discuss specialization measures that are based on frequency data and thus account for sampling intensity, and that overcome the problem of scale dependence. we then test these approaches by evaluating the effect of sampling effort and scale dependence on a published natural pollination network, and on randomly generated associations as a null model. we differentiate between species-level measures of specialization, useful to investigate variability among species within a web, and a single network-wide measure that can be used for comparisons across networks.

RESULTS
patterns in two pollinator networks
two selected plant-pollinator networks  differ markedly in their degree of specialization when quantitative analyses are applied. the qualitative network index, connectance, is similar in both interaction webs . however, frequencies of pollinator visits are much more evenly distributed in the british community than in the argentinean example. in the british web, the interaction between a dipteran species and leontodon hispidus was the most frequent one, representing 6% of the total  <dig> interactions observed. in the argentinean network, visits of aristotelia chilensis by a colletid bee species represented 20% of the  <dig> interactions alone. interactions between the top five plant and top five pollinator species made up 44% of the interactions in the british web, but 74% in the argentinean web. this difference in the heterogeneity of interaction frequencies is not evident in measures based on binary information such as number of links  or connectance . in contrast, the degree of specialization shown by the frequency-based index h2'  is much lower in the british community  compared to the argentinean community .

the variation of species-level specialization measures  holds valuable information for the structural properties of a network . the british pollination web is dominated by highly generalized pollinators , while putative specialists are represented by very few individuals and species . in contrast, most pollinators in the argentinean web are moderately generalized to specialized, with the second highest level of specialization found in the most common species . consequently, the weighted mean degree of specialization is much lower in the former web  than in the latter . the relationship between specialization of species i  and its interaction frequency  across the pollinator species differs between the two webs. in the british web, d'i and ai were not correlated significantly , while a highly positive correlation was found in the argentinean web . note that designation of any specialization index to a species i that is only represented by a single individual may be critical. however, significances in the above correlations remain unaffected when pollinators with one single interaction are excluded. from the plants' point of view, the species in memmott's web are also more generalized in terms of their pollinator spectrum  than the plants studied by vázquez and simberloff . the respective weighted means are <d'plants> =  <dig>  and <d'plants> =  <dig> . no significant correlation was found between the plants' frequency and specialization in either web . interestingly, plants were on average more specialized than pollinators in the british web , but not in the argentinean web. this distinction is not found when only the weighted mean number of links  are examined, since <lplants> is much greater than <lpoll.> in both networks. the difference in <l> may be driven by the highly asymmetrical matrix architecture in both webs, where the number of pollinator species greatly exceeds the number of plant species. the unweighted mean l¯

simulation of sampling effort
in order to test whether specialization estimates are dependent on sampling and scale effects, we simulated a decreased sampling intensity in both networks using rarefaction . in both networks, h2' is robust and already very well estimated by a small fraction of the interactions sampled . the coefficient of variance of h2' remains below 5% from about half of the total number of visits onwards in the british web and even at one-tenth of the total sampling effort of the argentinean web. the estimation of connectance  is also relatively stable at least in the argentinean web, although it shows a positive trend across sampling effort in the british web . these findings suggest that network-wide measures of specialization, particularly h2', do not necessarily require a very large or even complete association matrix, but can also be very well estimated from a smaller representative subset as long as there is no systematic sampling bias.

null model patterns
the degree of specialization can be further characterized by comparison with a null model. the null model used here is that each species has a fixed total number of interactions , but interactions are assigned randomly. in the above pollinator networks, random associations yield a specialization index h2' that remains close to zero for almost the entire range of sampling intensity, while connectance  shows a positive trend over the total number of interactions  . therefore, h2' derived from real networks may typically be clearly distinguished from this null model, while the comparison of c is complicated by scale dependence and the relatively large values yielded by the null model.

simulations of artificially generated random associations  confirm that the network-level specialization index h2' is largely unaffected by network size , network architecture  or total number of interactions  for a fixed matrix size . for random associations as shown here, h2' is usually close to zero. connectance values  of random matrices show the known hyperbolic function over the number of associated species , changes with matrix asymmetry  and increase strongly with increasing m . for specialization measures at the species level, the average number of links per species  increases strongly with network size, number of available partners, and m . while other niche breadth measures may also show some variation across different network scales , the weighted mean kullback-leibler distance <d'> is poorly affected by network size, network asymmetry, and number of interactions . both h2' and d' may thus be appropriate for comparisons across matrices of different scale.

discussion
properties of specialization measures
the suggested indices, d' and h2', quantify the degree of specialisation of elements within an interaction network and of the entire network, respectively. while the number of links  and connectance  represent species-level and community-level measures of interactions based on binary data, respectively, d' and h2' represent corresponding measures for frequency-based data. the need to include information on interaction strength or interaction frequency into network analyses has been announced by various authors  <cit> . parallel to earlier advances in diversity measures compared to species richness, quantitative network measures account for the heterogeneity in link strength rather than assigning equal weights to every link. moreover, we have shown that d' and h2' are largely robust against variation in matrix size, shape, and sampling effort. in several cases, c may be strongly affected by sampling effort  <cit> , while h2' remained largely unchanged in simulations of random associations over a range of network sizes, variable network asymmetries, and number of interactions. this scale invariance suggests that both d' and h2' can be used directly for comparisons across different networks, while comparisons of l and c are more problematic  <cit> .

qualitative methods like the indices suggested here also allow a more detailed analysis of interaction patterns within and across networks. fruitful areas include comparisons of networks across different interaction types  <cit> , biogeographical gradients  <cit> , biodiversity and land use gradients  <cit> , robustness of networks against extinction risks  <cit> , asymmetries between plants and animals  <cit> , and relationships between specialisation and abundance  <cit> . while a comparison of the average number of partners between plants versus animals is solely dependent on the matrix architecture , this limitation does not apply to d'. in the two selected pollinator webs, plants are either similarly or more specialised than pollinators in regard to weighted mean d'. this allows an scale-independent evaluation of asymmetries in the degree of specialization between partners . moreover, vázquez and aizen  <cit>  noted that the number of links of a species  is strongly positively correlated with its overall frequency  in five pollination networks including the datasets analyzed above. they argued that this apparent higher generalization of common plants and common pollinators may be largely explained by null models, calling for an improved measurement of specialization. our results for the correlation between d'i and ai in two pollinator webs suggest that the relationship between specialization and abundance may be more variable, and even positive as in the argentinean network.

caveats
some problems apply to any measure of network analyses including the proposed indices. measures of specialization mostly ignore phylogenetic relationships or ecological similarity within an association matrix. for example, a plant species that is pollinated by multiple moth species may be unsuitably regarded as more generalized than a plant pollinated by few insect species comprising several different orders  <cit> . in addition, the fact that herbivores are commonly specialized on host plant families rather than species may skew network patterns if not carefully accounted for. a first approach to investigate such effects may be to compare the level of specialization after a stepwise reduction of the matrix by pooling species to higher taxonomic units, such as genera, families, and orders. for known phylogenies, more advanced techniques for analyses with a particular evolutionary focus are available  <cit> . another deficiency may be that species or their partners are all given the same individual 'weight' in the analyses, whether they may be small bees or large bats visiting a small herb with little nectar or a mass flowering tree. null models as in the calculation for both c and h <dig> ' imply that all individuals can be shifted around between resources in the same way, irrespective of their size or non-fitting parameters. the role of 'forbidden links' as constraints to network analyses has been discussed elsewhere  <cit> . similarly, calculations of d' or other niche breadth measures are based on the implicit assumption that each species adjusts its interactions according to the availability of partners , irrespective of morphological or behavioral constraints. moreover, if data are collected from a large heterogeneous habitat or over a prolonged time period, calculations of the degree of specialization may be severely constrained by the spatiotemporal overlap or non-overlap between partners for other reasons than resource preferences, e.g. when not all species are able to reach all sites in the same way, or when some resources and consumers have asynchronous phenologies. consequently, network analyses as suggested here will be most useful to study resource-consumer partitioning within a short time frame and limited spatial scale.

for both indices d' and h2', we proposed above to use the total number of interactions for each species as a measure of partner availability  and as constraint for standardization . it may be debated whether independent measures of plant and animal abundances could be more appropriate than using interaction frequency data as such. however, despite the fact that such abundance data barely exist for most networks, note that the actual number of interactions often more suitably reflects resource availability and consumer activity than an independent measure of species abundance. for instance, a flower of one species may have a much higher nectar production than another and consequently receive a higher number of visitors, while the local abundance of the plant species does not reflect such differences in resource quality and/or quantity. both d' and h2' thus focus on the actual partitioning between the interacting species. in studies where detailed knowledge or theoretical assumptions about resources  or consumers  are available or under experimental control, such data may be incorporated into the analysis  instead of interaction frequencies. the constraint of fixed row and column totals has been debated elsewhere in the context of species co-occurrence patterns, where it was found to be most appropriate in null model comparisons, although critics have argued earlier that these marginals themselves may already reflect competitive interactions . any approach to compare networks based on fixed marginals for standardization will fail to detect potentially meaningful patterns displayed by these architectural features, namely the number of resource and consumer species and the heterogeneity of total interaction frequencies. this network architecture may already be shaped by past competitive interactions or indicate fundamental constraints, a largely unexplored hypothesis that merits additional investigations.

it should also be emphasized that analyses of frequency data may be susceptible for pseudoreplication of repeated associations of the same individuals or close associations derived from a single dispersal event . these may lead to an overestimation of specialization. to be more meaningful on a population level, frequency analyses should thus be based on spatially independent association replicates. note that all species-wise specialization measures such as d' are sensitive to the behavior of the other species. any systematic sampling bias  will therefore affect the conclusions of comparisons within or across networks.

CONCLUSIONS
in accordance with previous calls  <cit> , we suggest that the explicit inclusion of frequency data reflects an important step forward in network analyses, as too many assumptions are implicit in any measure based on binary representation. most notably, connectance and 'number of partners' imply an equal availability of all partners – an unlikely scenario. qualitative indices are not robust against sampling effort. on the contrary, the proposed quantitative measures based on interaction frequencies explicitly account for this source of variation. our study suggests that d' and h2' represent scale-independent and meaningful indices to characterize specialization on the level of single species and the entire network, respectively. these novel indices allow us to investigate patterns within and across networks that have not been detected with qualitative measures such as correlations with species frequencies, network size and asymmetries in specialization between partners. recently, bascompte et al.  <cit>  showed that the incorporation of frequency data may unveil pervasive asymmetries within networks. particularly since vázquez et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that interaction frequencies in plant-pollinator and plant-seed disperser systems often correlate with the magnitude of mutualistic services for the plant , an increased collection of frequency data and appropriate quantitative analyses would greatly benefit future network studies.
