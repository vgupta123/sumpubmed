BACKGROUND
the analysis of rare and biologically important cell subtypes presents a common challenge in the study of cancer, immunology, development and infectious disease. subtypes within a sample are often not observable through bulk molecular measurements performed on the entire population . consequently, tools that can individually analyze single cells within a population are essential for uncovering critical biological information on subtypes. fluorescence activated cell sorting  is one such single-cell analysis method that has been widely employed to characterize heterogeneous populations of cells  <cit> . although facs is very high in throughput and can recover cells for downstream analysis, it relies on antibody staining that can be laborious and is often low in sensitivity. more importantly, antibodies are unable to characterize nucleic acid based biomarkers such as transcripts, genomic dna, and mrna splice variants. to overcome this limitation, cytometry methods that rely on fluorescence in situ hybridization  have been used to enumerate and sort cells based on nucleic acid sequences of interest ; however, fish-flow cytometry requires numerous sample processing steps that can result in significant cell loss, alter the gene expression profile of the cell or preclude downstream sequencing of the isolated cells.

a promising new approach to single-cell analysis relies upon molecular barcodes that are paired with the transcriptomes of individual cells confined to microwells or emulsion droplets . the barcoded oligonucleotides enable reverse transcription of polyadenylated mrnas and are used to reconstruct, in silico, the gene expression profiles of individual cells following sequencing of the pooled single-cell rna-seq libraries. the relatively unbiased nature of this type of approach makes it a powerful “bottom up” tool for the discovery of unknown cell subtypes  <cit> . although barcoding methods improve upon the throughput of previous single-cell sequencing methods  <cit> , most of them are restricted to the analysis of only hundreds to a few thousand cells per experiment and many of the cells within a sample can be lost due to inefficient barcode pairing  <cit> . this significant throughput limitation makes them unsuitable for biological samples consisting of tens or hundreds of thousands of cells.

we previously introduced a novel cytometry technology, pcr-activated cell sorting , which is able to analyze more than  <dig>  individual cells in parallel  <cit> , a level of throughput over 40-fold higher than single-cell barcode sequencing methodologies. pacs works by interrogating individual cells with multiplexed taqman pcr assays performed in microfluidic droplets for the presence of specific combinations of transcripts, splice variants, non-coding rnas or genomic dna and accurately sorts the cell material for further processing  <cit> . the use of readily available taqman assays enables pacs to sort cells with high-specificity, low cost and minimal assay optimization-major advantages over other cytometry approaches. another key feature of pacs is the use of a two-step microfluidic workflow that first compartmentalizes cells into droplets and then prepares the cell lysate for amplification prior to subsequent microfluidic addition of the taqman rt-pcr reagents. this approach is critical for mitigating non-specific taqman probe fluorescence and inhibition of rt-pcr enzymes caused by high concentrations of untreated crude cell lysate in microdroplets . additionally, this two-step microfluidic workflow affords the use of smaller volume microdroplets that both reduce reagent cost and enable high throughput.

pacs, like facs and fish-flow cytometry, is a “top down” approach to subdividing cell populations  <cit> . this approach requires pre-selection of known nucleic acid biomarkers for the multiplex taqman reactions and subsequent cell subtype classification. while the enumeration of cell subtypes provides valuable information to researchers, for pacs to be most useful, it would not only offer a unique and advantageous approach for the initial high-throughput cell classification and enrichment, but also enable unbiased high-dimensional profiling of gene expression following isolation of subtypes. this additional capability would make pacs ideally-suited for the analysis of subtypes from large heterogeneous cell populations such as circulating tumor cells partially enriched from blood , disaggregated solid tumors , leukemias , virally infected cells , stem cells  <cit>  and subpopulations of the immune system  <cit> .

in this report, we further characterize pacs and show that the method is capable of sensitive detection of prostate cancer cells across multiple taqman assays and cell types. we also demonstrate unbiased rna sequencing on pacs isolated cells and show that this approach can be used to uncover the gene expression profiles of cells that were originally masked by heterogeneity in the unsorted population. these capabilities make pacs valuable for isolating rare and clinically relevant cell subtypes for comprehensive molecular characterization.

RESULTS
pacs workflow for expression profiling
to investigate heterogeneous cell populations with the pacs workflow, cells from a mixed cell suspension are first encapsulated and lysed in microdroplets . the cells are encapsulated at limiting dilution such that most drops are empty but ~1–5 % contain single cells, in a process governed by poisson statistics. following cell lysis and thermal incubation, the droplet-compartmentalized lysate is then merged with rt-pcr reagents and in-droplet taqman pcr assays are performed to identify the presence of target nucleic acids . the reactions can be multiplexed to detect the expression of specific combinations of nucleic acids in individual cells by using separate taqman hydrolysis probes, each linked to a different fluorophore. the taqman generated fluorescence values associated with single cells in droplets can be visualized on scatter plots and used to trigger dielectrophoretic droplet sorting when the desired target subtype is identified   <cit> . the cell contents from the isolated droplets are then recovered and prepared for downstream molecular analysis, including transcriptome profiling . unlike our previous method that sampled a portion of each cell’s lysate for single-cell droplet pcr  <cit> , the totality of the lysate is now analyzed and sorted with pacs.fig.  <dig> workflow for droplet-based rare cell enrichment and analysis. a single cells from a heterogeneous population are encapsulated in microfluidic droplets and lysed . the cell content is merged with rt-pcr reagents, and single cell taqman assays are performed in droplets. pcr-activated cell sorting  allows the recovery of droplets with the desired taqman fluorescence profile . after breaking the emulsion, the nucleic acids are recovered and used for downstream analysis, including library preparation for rna-seq  and gene expression analysis 



sensitive rare cell detection with pacs
the analysis of rare cells within a population requires detection that is both specific for the target cells and also capable of sensitively interrogating each and every cell within a sample. cell spike-in experiments offer a straightforward way to assess pacs detection efficiency on a known number of target cells. to investigate the specificity and sensitivity of our method for target cell spike-in detection, we first established a multiplex taqman pcr assay that could be used to precisely identify differing numbers of prostate cancer cells from a background population of lymphocytes. vimentin  is an intermediate filament protein that is highly expressed in cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchimal transitions and is generally absent from cells of lymphopoietic origin  <cit> ; conversely, ptprc is commonly expressed in leukocytes, but not highly expressed in prostate cell types  <cit> . a multiplex taqman assay targeting vim and ptprc transcripts should identify both lymphocyte and prostate cancer cell types used in our spike-in experiments. in the example spike-in assay shown in fig. 2a,  <dig> pc <dig> cells were mixed with ~ <dig>  raji cells and analyzed with the pacs workflow using a hex-labeled taqman assay targeting vim, and a fam-labeled taqman assay targeting ptprc. to independently verify correlation of vim+ taqman signal with spike-in cells, the prostate cancer cells were stained with calcein violet. as shown in the scatter plots, we efficiently identified a total of  <dig> out of  <dig>  calcein positive spike-in cells with pacs. furthermore, the majority of the drops containing calcein violet were also positive for vim expression  confirming the specificity and sensitivity of single-cell taqman detection in droplets.  <dig> of the  <dig> vim-positive drops  were also positive for ptprc fam signal. this was likely due to either low-level ptprc expression in some pc <dig> cells or co-encapsulation with a background raji cell. the ptprc+ droplets were easily excluded from sorting, preventing possible contamination of the sorted cancer cells with undesirable background cells.fig.  <dig> sensitivity and specificity of detection of rare cells using pacs. a scatter-plot diagram of cell stain intensity values, and ptprc  or vim  fluorescence from multiplexed taqman assays.  <dig> out of  <dig> pc <dig> cells expressed vim, and only  <dig> of  <dig> also expressed ptprc. the blue lines represent the thresholds applied to differentiate clusters; the heat map correlates with drop counts. b dynamic range of pacs. different numbers of pc <dig>  or du <dig>  cancer cells were spiked in and sorted from a background of lymphocyte raji cells. the scatter plot shows strong correlation between the number of cells spiked in and the number of vim+ drops, with a recovery of 82 % and 75 % for pc <dig> and du <dig>  respectively. straight lines represent the fit across spike-ins. c the scatter plot shows the reproducibility of the pacs workflow across spike-ins in the two cancer cell lines. the detection efficiency  is consistently above 89 %  and 85 %  for pc <dig> and du <dig> cells, respectively



to further characterize the sensitivity and limit of cell detection with the pacs workflow, we spiked calcein-labeled pc <dig> cells into ~ <dig>  raji cells at cell numbers of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cells. using the vim+/ptprc- taqman assay selection criteria, we accurately identified and recovered, on average, 82 % of pc <dig> input cells across the different spike-in cell populations with pacs . notably, vim+ taqman correlation with the calcein positive droplets displayed an average of 92 % and a minimum of 89 % taqman detection rates for these experiments . critically, these results were not unique to pc <dig> cells. we obtained similar pacs results with a different prostate cancer cell line, du <dig>  on average 75 % of the calcein positive du <dig> input spike-ins were identified, with an average vim+ taqman detection rate of 93 % and a minimum of 85 % .

we also investigated whether background cell populations that more closely resemble a complex primary biological sample affected pacs detection of prostate cancer cells. peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were isolated from whole blood and used as the background cell population for pc <dig> cell spike-in experiments. we and others have observed significant vimentin expression within pbmc cell populations  <cit> ; consequently, we used taqman assays targeting epcam and arhgap <dig> transcripts for specific identification of prostate cancer cells. similar to our results shown in fig. 2a, we identified spiked-in pc <dig> cells at a sensitivity of 83 % with the taqman assay targeting epcam and 94 % with the taqman assay targeting arhgap <dig>   <cit> . collectively, these data indicate that pacs is capable of detecting multiple rare cell types with high specificity and sensitivity.

rare cell molecular analysis following pacs isolation
to test whether pacs sorting can efficiently enrich target cell mrna for downstream analysis, we examined krt <dig> transcript levels before and after sorting . krt <dig> is a cytokeratin that is expressed by many epithelial cancer cells but mostly absent in lymphocytes  <cit> . we quantified the expression of this transcript in the cell lysate derived from both unsorted pc3:raji cell spike-in populations as well as pacs vim+/ptprc- sorted spike-ins , and compared its relative abundance to gapdh to control for different amounts of input material. we reasoned that if pacs accurately identified and sorted pc <dig> cells from the heterogeneous population, we would expect the relative abundance of krt19/gapdh following sorting to resemble that of the pure pc <dig> cells, while the unsorted material would show reduced krt <dig> levels due to the presence of mostly raji cells with a small percentage of high-expressing pc <dig> cells. indeed, qrt-pcr analysis on material recovered from a pacs sorted  <dig> pc <dig> cell spike-in experiment showed that krt <dig> and gapdh were expressed at similar levels, and closely matched the relative expression observed for the pure pc <dig> population . as expected, pre-sorted material had much lower krt <dig> expression relative to gapdh . pacs-sorted material shows a similar level of krt19/gapdh enrichment across the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cell spike-in numbers, again validating that our approach is both accurate and sensitive . the variability observed in these experiments could be attributed to biological noise. with the small number of cells analyzed, cell-to-cell variability in gene expression can play a substantial role in the overall expression pattern of krt <dig>  additionally, effects from rna loss during processing and handling could also increase with decreasing cell numbers leading to higher variability in the qrt-pcr reactions.fig.  <dig> krt <dig> expression analysis on pacs-sorted cells. a-b representative qrt-pcr amplification curves using rna from pure raji and pc <dig> populations , or a  <dig> pc <dig> cell spike-in unsorted and vim + −sorted material  amplified using taqman assays targeting gapdh and the pc3-specific krt <dig> gene. c relative quantification of krt <dig> in vim + −sorted lysate compared to material from a heterogeneous population across several cell spike-ins shows reliable enrichment in sorted material. dark red line represents the maximum ΔΔct krt <dig> calculated as the difference in Δct values between pure pc <dig> and raji populations. error bars = sem



transcriptome analysis of pacs-sorted cancer cells
high-dimensional, quantitative gene expression analysis with rna sequencing can yield crucial insight into rare cell states and behaviors  <cit> . the successful enrichment and qrt-pcr analysis of krt <dig> expression indicated that next-generation transcriptome sequencing on pacs isolated cell subtypes might be possible. thermocycling can potentially reduce the amount of intact rna in a sample; therefore, we chose to optimize a random priming approach for rna-seq . we generated transcriptome libraries from replicate vim+/ptprc- sorted cell lysate derived from  <dig> pc <dig> cells spiked into  <dig>  b-lymphocyte raji cells, and compared them with libraries prepared from unsorted heterogeneous cell spike-in populations . overall, we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes ,  <dig>  of which were enriched in the vim + −sorted population and  <dig>  in the starting unsorted population . we then analyzed the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes in rna-seq data obtained from pure pc <dig> or raji rna . strikingly, the expression profiles from pure pc <dig> rna closely resembled the vim + −sorted rna , indicating that pacs successfully enriched pc <dig> cells and uncovered the prostate cancer cell transcriptional signature that was not observable in the unsorted population. the transcriptional signatures of the unsorted spike-in population and the raji cells are also well correlated ; however, as expected, the correlation is slightly lower than between the vim+-sorted and pc <dig> samples due to the presence of pc <dig> cells in the unsorted population .fig.  <dig> transcriptome analysis of pacs-sorted cells. a hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed  between vim + −sorted droplets and the raji:pc <dig>  starting heterogeneous population.  <dig>  and  <dig>  vim+ sorted cells were sequenced from the two replicate experiments. the expression of the same  <dig> genes in the pure lymphocyte  and prostate cancer cell  populations are shown for comparison. the genes in red were independently verified as being differentially expressed in pc <dig> cells. the heat map represents z-scores of log <dig> counts per million  venn diagram showing the number of de genes in common between prostate cancer pc <dig> cells and vim + −sorted material when each is independently compared to the lymphocyte raji cell line. of the  <dig> de genes in vim + −sorted material, and  <dig> de genes in pc <dig> cells,  <dig>  are in common



we expected the pacs vim + −sorted material to be enriched in transcripts representative of prostate cells that are epithelial in origin, and to be depleted of genes typical of immune cells. indeed, genes differentially expressed in the vim + −sorted population play roles in epithelial polarity  and adhesion , cell migration  and known markers of prostate cells . conversely, the unsorted rna is enriched in lymphocyte-specific transcripts and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation .

to further demonstrate that sequencing results from pacs-sorted rna are similar to those obtained from rna isolated directly from cells, we compared the transcriptional profiles of pure pc <dig> populations or those from vim+-sorted cells to the profile of pure raji cells. we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes as differentially expressed  in the vim + −sorted and the pc <dig> cell populations, respectively. notably, 78 % of the genes found to be differentially expressed in the pure pc <dig> cells were also identified as differentially expressed from the vim + −sorted material . these results support the use of pacs for high-dimensional gene expression profiling on sorted cell subtypes.

validation of differentially expressed genes with single-cell rt-pcr
we next sought to validate our transcriptome profiling results by investigating the single-cell expression profiles of selected genes  found to be enriched in vim+ pacs sorted rna-seq libraries . similar to previous experiments, pc <dig> cells were stained with calcein violet and spiked into a raji background population. if the target transcripts were differentially expressed in pc <dig> cells, we would expect the taqman signal to be highly correlated with cell staining. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the majority of pc <dig> cells expressed each target gene , while only a small fraction of raji cells did . the presence of target transcripts in some of the raji population does not hinder pacs enrichment of pc <dig> cells, since the raji cells are also positive for ptprc expression detected with the multiplexed taqman approach. subsequent to the above experiments, we added cy <dig> dye detection capability to the pacs platform for expanded multiplex detection using calcein, a taqman assay targeting lymphocytes  and two taqman assays specific for prostate cancer cells . these experiments validate the results from our transcriptome profiling data and underscore the value of pacs for rare cell subtype characterization and biomarker discovery.fig.  <dig> confirmation of differentially expressed genes. a-d in the scatter plots, most drops containing pc <dig> cells  show expression of mal <dig>  arhgap <dig>  cd <dig>  and krt <dig> , compared with sparse expression of the same genes in drops containing raji lymphocytes  in multiplexed taqman assays. the blue lines are the thresholds to define clusters; the heat map colors are proportional to drop counts



discussion
pacs is a powerful approach to cell subtype identification, sorting and characterization. a fundamental feature of the pacs workflow is the use of inexpensive, reliable and readily available taqman assays. these assays allow for extremely sensitive and specific detection of nucleic acids and give pacs key advantages over other “top down” approaches to cell identification and sorting. we showed that a vim+/ptprc- multiplex taqman assay run on the pacs workflow enables high-fidelity identification of prostate cancer cells from both a background cell line or primary cell population. pacs is currently configured for detection of four fluorescent channels. with further expansion of our fluorescence detection capability, pacs should enable efficient multiplexing of at least five independent taqman assays using readily available probe dye and quencher combinations. the ability to multiplex both positive and negative selection markers with pacs provides efficient target cell identification with an extremely low false positive rate. it is important to note that pacs is flexible and not restricted to assaying only calcein viability dye and mrna transcripts within cells. pacs has also been used to identify cell subtypes based on non-coding rna and genomic dna sequences, a capability not possible with single-cell barcoding methods that rely on polyadenylated mrna  <cit> . moreover, the pacs method can simultaneously interrogate cells labeled with fluorescent antibodies against surface markers together with taqman reaction fluorescence. this ability to correlate protein and nucleic acid biomarkers in a single workflow could prove highly effective for the unambiguous identification of many cell subtypes.

while pacs relies on preselected taqman assays to initially identify cell subtypes, unbiased transcriptome profiling on the contents of isolated cells can reveal essential information on the biology underlying the selected subpopulation. the principal challenge to expression profiling on pacs sorted material is the fragmentation of cellular rna during droplet thermocycling in the presence of divalent cations, which produces rna quality similar to ffpe samples. to overcome this challenge, we optimized a random-priming rna library preparation protocol that works well on pacs-sorted rna. the ability of this protocol to deliver accurate and minimally biased transcriptome information is evidenced by our data. we show that sequencing of pacs sorted rna is sufficient to correctly differentiate among cell subtypes and extract cell-specific transcriptional signatures. in addition to transcriptome profiling, pacs could also enable full genome sequencing on isolated cell subtypes. we previously demonstrated the ability to perform targeted genomic dna sequencing with pacs and a related droplet-based enrichment method, mesa  <cit> . the combination of transcriptome and genome sequencing makes pacs a unique platform to reveal not only key aspects of cell behaviors, but also the genetic drivers responsible for those behaviors.

the potential applications of pacs are numerous and encompass multiple fields in the life sciences. with a demonstrated throughput of over  <dig>  cells per experiment  <cit> , pacs is uniquely suited for analyzing large heterogeneous cell populations, including immune cells, disaggregated tumors and even circulating tumor and fetal cells, especially when combined with cell pre-enrichment or depletion strategies. moreover, pacs is most useful when the cell subtype can’t be identified with antibodies, either because a suitably specific antibody is not available or the biomarker of interest is not translated into a protein. for example, pacs could allow the detection and isolation of human cells latently infected with hiv by directly targeting the genome integrated virus with taqman reactions  <cit> . subsequent transcriptome profiling on these isolated cell reservoirs could identify critical host cell factors contributing to persistent infection and/or latency. another unique pacs use case would be for the detection of non-coding rnas or alternative splicing events that mark a disease state or contribute to its pathology  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
pacs is a novel cytometry method that is capable of detecting and isolating target cell subtypes with high sensitivity. the throughput, minimal sample processing and use of readily available taqman assays afford pacs significant advantages over existing tools for studying cellular heterogeneity. with the added ability to sequence rna following sorting, we anticipate pacs will prove widely useful for enumerating and transcriptionally profiling rare cell subtypes from complex biological samples. understanding the transcriptional status of these rare cells will aid in the study of human health and the causes of disease.
