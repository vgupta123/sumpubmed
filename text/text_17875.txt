BACKGROUND
the study of gene function in the wine grape  has been fundamentally advanced by the availability of whole genome sequences of two pinot noir cultivars   <cit>  as well as bac-based physical maps  <cit> . to study wine grape gene function, multiple transcriptomic approaches have been developed  <cit> , including expressed sequence tags   <cit> , massively parallel signature sequencing   <cit> , small rna deep sequencing  <cit> , illumina sequencing  <cit> , and multiple oligonucleotide microarray platforms  <cit> .

most v. vinifera varieties are ranked as moderately sensitive to sensitive to salinity stress  <cit>  with cl- anion toxicity having the greatest impact on growth and vine health  <cit> . in contrast, v. vinifera is relatively water-deficit stress tolerant. regulated-deficit irrigation can be used advantageously to inhibit vine growth without significant effects on fruit yield and has been reported to improve grape quality through the elevation of a variety of metabolites including anthocyanins and proanthocyanins  <cit> . mrna and enzyme expression profiles during development and in response to abiotic stress effects have been studied intensively in wine grape berries  <cit> . additional studies have examined mrna expression patterns in response to abiotic stresses in leaves and shoot tissues  <cit> , plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> , and the events associated with vitis bud endodormancy  <cit> .

the roots of terrestrial plants are vital organs for the acquisition of water and essential minerals. as such, roots serve as the first site of perception and/or injury for many types of abiotic stress, including water deficiency, salinity, nutrient deficiency, and heavy metals  <cit> . vitis roots also accumulate a number of unique stilbene and oligostilbene defense compounds, chemical species not found in seed or other phytoalexin-rich tissues  <cit> . despite the importance of roots, the study of v. vinifera root tissues has been rather limited in contrast to the study of berry tissues. in a comparative est study, moser and colleagues generated  <dig> ests from v. vinifera cv. pinot noir root tissue and found them enriched for genes with functions in primary metabolism and energy  <cit> . using a  <dig> k combimatrix custom array, mica and colleagues profiled the expression of micrornas , small  non-coding rnas that negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally in multiple organs. this study showed that roots had nine and four mirnas with either significantly increased or decreased relative abundance, respectively, relative to leaves and early inflorescences  <cit> . a framework physical or genetic map has also been developed for wine grape, using resistant and susceptible crosses, to locate genetic determinants associated with resistance to the root pathogen phylloxera  <cit> . est transcriptional profiling has recently been used to identify genes that might be involved in resistance to rhizobium vitis in the semi-resistant vitis hybrid 'tamnara'  <cit> .

in grapevine, more than  <dig>  est sequences have been generated and analyzed to identify gene expression related to a wide range of processes including berry development in wine grape  <cit>  and in table grape  <cit> , tissue-specific gene expression  <cit> , the fulfillment of chilling requirements in dormant grape buds  <cit> , and the characterization of resistance to pathogens such as xylella fastidiosa  <cit>  and rhizobium vitis  <cit> . to discern how steady-state transcript accumulation changes in response to multiple environmental stress treatments, we generated a total of  <dig>  ests from leaf and berry tissues from vines subjected to abiotic stresses . these were compared with  <dig>  ests within  <dig> libraries derived from leaf and berry tissues deposited in the public databases. clustering and assembly of leaf and berry ests with all available v. vinifera full-length transcripts and ests returned a total of  <dig>  unique sequences, with  <dig> singletons and  <dig>  clusters mapping to known gene models. of these  <dig>  unique clusters,  <dig> transcripts were found to have significant differential expression among the libraries examined. comparison of in silico digital expression analysis with transcript abundance estimates obtained by affymetrix vitis genechip® genome microarrays and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  revealed that est frequency counts were in moderate agreement with microarray or qrt-pcr analysis. given the relative lack of ests available for grape root tissues,  <dig>  ests were sequenced from roots of young vines , grown under unstressed conditions as well as under cold, salinity, and water deficit stress. the major categories of genes expressed in root tissues were defined and  <dig> genes with root-specific or highly enriched root expression patterns were identified.

RESULTS
est library analysis from abiotically stressed tissues of vitis vinifera
cdna libraries derived from abiotically stressed leaves  and berries  of v. vinifera cv. chardonnay, were sequenced to generate  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests, respectively . in addition, a total of  <dig>  ests were sequenced from a normalized cdna library synthesized from magenta box grown root tissues from cv. cabernet sauvignon exposed to control, water deficit, cold, and salinity stress conditions  . in total,  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  were generated . the leaf and berry libraries were described previously in the context of flower and berry development  <cit> . in addition, five unstressed leaf libraries, representing a total of  <dig> ests,  <dig> whole berry with seeds libraries derived from unstressed source tissues at various stages of berry development, representing a total of  <dig>  ests, and two root libraries, representing a total of  <dig> ests, present within the unigene database  <cit>  were compiled . these est collections were used as tools to identify transcripts encoding abiotic stress responsive transcripts in leaves and berries and root-specific or root-enriched transcripts.

libraries generated or used in the present study. the stressed leaf  and stressed berry  libraries were generated previously  <cit> , the stressed root "vvm" library was generated specifically for this study, and all other libraries were obtained from the dbest database maintained by the ncbi. tissues, dbest library identifier, sequencing direction, and library descriptions are provided. unique clones were identified from the ests of bidirectionally sequenced libraries as described in the "methods" and "results" sections.

n.d. not determined

to create up-to-date annotations, each est was matched with the corresponding "tentative consensus"  contig sequence from the vitis vinifera gene index   <cit>  and predicted peptide sequences from the genoscope  <dig> x vitis vinifera cv. pinot noir  genome assembly, august  <dig>   <dig>  <cit> . a newer version of vvgi  was released since this analysis was undertaken. however, this release is substantially similar to  <dig> , containing the same  <dig>  gene models derived from the ncbi refseq source and only  <dig> additional ests and was not expected to substantially alter the findings presented. a newer 12x coverage draft of the vitis vinifera genome has also become available. however, some gene models annotated in this 12x draft were found to contain greater frequencies of intron-exon splices not supported by est evidence  and, therefore, the 12x draft was not used. because the mixed stress normalized root library was generated using a normalization technique that would, in effect, reduce the apparent expression of the most abundant transcripts, and because few other unstressed root ests were available for comparison, characterization of the genes in the root est library was performed in a separate analysis.

identifying est redundancy
in estimation of gene expression patterns inferred from est frequencies, which are the number of times the transcript of gene xi is observed in relation to the total number of random observations of all genes, , any ests from a single clone sequenced from both the 5' and 3' directions must be counted exactly once to avoid overestimation of the frequency of genes. cdna library sequencing strategies varied among sources, with some ests being generated from only single-pass 5' or 3' reads, whereas other libraries were subjected to bi-directional and/or same-direction re-sequencing of picked clones. in the abiotically stressed leaf library ,  <dig> ests had been sequenced twice . another  <dig> ests had been sequenced three times . eliminating this redundancy reduced the est total from  <dig>  ests to  <dig>  unique clones . the gsviv gene identifiers of paired clone ends were compared with the expectation that gene ids would agree between multiple ests from the same transcript. of the  <dig> pairs of clones from this abiotically stressed leaf library,  <dig>  pairs matched the annotation of different genes and the id with greatest confidence score was retained. similarly, only  <dig> of the  <dig> triplicated clones  within this library were in disagreement as to gene identity. the total clone redundancy and gene assignment error rates were similar for ests from the stressed berry library . in this est collection,  <dig> ests had been sequenced twice ,  <dig> ests had been sequenced three times , and two clones had been sequenced four times each. eliminating this redundancy reduced the est total from  <dig>  ests to  <dig>  unique clones . of the  <dig> pairs and  <dig> triplicates,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were in disagreement, respectively.

this method of redundancy elimination was extended next to those bi-directionally sequenced clones from the non-stressed leaf and berry libraries obtained from the unigene database . many errors were found in the annotated compositions of leaf  and berry libraries . the errors and the corrections made are explained below as presented in figure  <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  for the cabernet sauvignon leaf library ca48ln , we were able to organize  <dig> ests into 743-paired reads. within these pairs, > 68%  could not be assigned to the same gene. similarly, high rates of disagreement were found within other libraries listed in table  <dig>  as these rates were higher than those observed in paired reads from abiotically stressed leaf or berry libraries, the cause or causes of these higher error rates were investigated further.

leaf library id 12752
and
errors in the supplied annotation of a set of cdna clones that were sequenced bidirectionally were identified and corrected to generate accurate counts of est frequency. errors are categorized by the scope of the error, from "well slips" between single pairs of 5' and 3' 96-well plates of ests, through incorrectly identified pairs of plates of increasing scope. the number of times each error occurred  and was corrected is shown. errors that are visualized by dot-plot in figure  <dig> are cross-referenced.

the cdna libraries presented in table  <dig> were bidirectionally sequenced and had annotation that allowed for the partial reconstruction of the workflow by which they were prepared and sequenced originally  <cit>  with clone names deposited to ncbi such as "ca48ln09if-a <dig>  5'end." this annotation identifies the library "ca48ln," a batch number , location on a 96-well plate  and direction . all ests in a given library shared the library stem, batches generally contained four plates , and 80% of plates were sequenced from both 5' and 3' directions. when the forward and reverse pairs of ests in library id  <dig> were organized by their 96-well plate well order , various patterns of "well slip" were identified, wherein the gene id for well a <dig>  matched the gene id of well a <dig> , a <dig>  matched a <dig> , and so forth. the distance of these "well slips" was neither uniform nor consistent.

to determine all pairs of ests with incorrectly paired wells, a method was devised that would identify robustly "well slips" of non-uniform distances, analogous to the dot-plot method of local nucleotide sequence alignment  <cit> . in this method, the gene ids of ests were arranged from a1-h <dig> for each 5' and 3' plate and plotted along two axes with a dot designating wherever the gene ids were identical . the dot plot proved effective at identifying forward-reverse pairing in plates with "well slips," such as in figure 1a, wherein the four forward and reverse plates of "batch 09" in leaf library id  <dig> were plotted in the order 1f, 1r, 2f, 2r, 3f, 3r, 4r along both the × and y axes. the main diagonal bisecting the plot, where the ordered list is identical to itself, is flanked by four offset diagonals that illustrate where the forward and reverse plate pairs match . the matching clearly distinguished pairs of plates through the variable "well slips" in library id  <dig> 

this matching process was repeated for all plate batches  of the libraries listed in table  <dig> and other error types besides the "well slips" seen in library id  <dig> were uncovered. some plates were duplicated, as seen in figure 1b, wherein all combinations of the forward and reverse of four individual plates matched in berry library id  <dig> . were these errors not identified, the ests of plate  <dig> and  <dig> would have been added both to the frequency totals of the genes therein , resulting in an overestimation of the frequency of those transcripts in the library. other pairs of plates showed a less complete duplication pattern as seen as the inchoate diagonals between plates  <dig> and  <dig>  and between  <dig> and  <dig>  in figure 1e, and all four plates  in figure 1f. in other cases, a plate did not match the annotated reverse, but a different plate instead, such as the pair-swapping of library id  <dig>  in figure 1c and triplication  / mis-pairing  in berry library id  <dig> . where identified, these partial duplications and mismatched plates were handled just as the full duplications were, with the est counts reduced to reflect the true number of independent clones involved.

the same analytical method was then extended to compare every plate in a library to all other plates in that library. one additional case of unexpected matching was found, where plates from one batch match the plates of a different batch in the same library . lastly, we extended the method to compare every plate in every library against all other plates in all other libraries, even those annotated as arising from different tissues. from this, a single instance was found where a plate in the leaf library id  <dig>  was identical to a pair of plates from berry library id  <dig> . the genes encoded on these plates were consistent with those found in mature berry library , but not a leaf library, leading to the conclusion that a cdna library misassignment error had occurred, and leading to the exclusion of these data from our analyses. to uncover other possible library assignment errors, every plate from all libraries in the present study were compared against all other libraries  that were not considered for our abiotic stress analysis, but no further spurious pairings were detected . upon exhaustively identifying all observable patterns of errors, 5' ests were paired with their 3' partners and the unique clones within each library were counted . in total, errors in the identification/annotation of  <dig> of  <dig>  ests  were discovered from the libraries listed in table  <dig> 

estimating gene expression by est frequency
in order to measure differences in gene expression patterns among stressed and unstressed leaves and berries, the est frequency within each gsviv gene id  was calculated for each leaf, berry, stressed leaf, and stressed berry library. the est frequencies of the five leaf libraries were combined by weighted mean, as were the  <dig> berry frequencies  <cit> . differential gene expression was then calculated using the combined est frequency counts for genes using the ideg <dig> web tool  <cit> . the chi-squared test  was used as the test statistic, as recommended when conducting statistical comparisons of more than two groups  <cit> . at a p-value cutoff of <  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were estimated to have differential expression among the libraries compared. the  <dig> genes were then organized by hierarchical clustering, using a function of the pearson correlation coefficient as the distance metric and the average agglomeration method . the sets of genes clustered first between tissue type, as seen by the first branching in the dendrogram, and then by control or abiotic stress condition, as seen in the next two branches. at this distance the four clusters generally correlated to transcript abundance profiles within a single library type with the largest cluster of  <dig> transcripts corresponding to tissues of stressed leaves . the leaf cluster  contained  <dig> genes, whereas stressed berry  and unstressed berry clusters  contained  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. the annotation, gene models, and relative frequencies of all  <dig> genes are listed by cluster in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the high number of transcripts present within the stressed leaf cluster might reflect the depth to which this library was sequenced, the variety of abiotic stresses to which these source tissues were subjected, and the diversity of transcripts expressed within the grape leaf transcriptome under abiotic stresses  <cit> .

of these  <dig> genes with differential expression among the cdna library clusters,  <dig> were matched successfully to gsviv gene/protein identifiers, which were then matched with the annotation files associated with vitisnet  <cit> . vitisnet networks were combined into categories of their major networks, with metabolic networks divided into primary metabolism, photosynthesis, secondary metabolism, and hormone biosynthesis, the latter category being grouped with the hormone signaling category. gene ids that were "out-of-network", but that had functional annotations associated with them in the vitisnet master list were also incorporated into the functional category designations. in figure  <dig>  the functional categories of genes identified within the four major clusters are shown.

without over-interpretation, some key differences among the functional categories of genes prominent within each organ/condition are clearly apparent. for example, unstressed leaves  were distinguished by a large proportion  of primary metabolic genes with some photosynthetic genes, such as rubisco small subunit and plastidic photosynthetic electron transport components being extremely over represented. transcripts for non-specific lipid-transfer protein, metallothionein, early light-induced protein , and several unknown genes were also highly represented within this cluster along with 23s rrna . in stressed leaf, 11% of transcripts encoded photosynthesis-related functions, including plastidic atp synthase and electron transport chain subunits, suggesting that higher demands and/or damage might occur under stress that must be repaired . consistent with this suggestion is the over representation of several families of low molecular heat shock proteins. leaves under abiotic stress expressed a greater proportion of specific transport genes  . interestingly, the activity of transposons is apparently de-repressed in stressed leaves as judged by the preponderance  of a centromere-specific class of retrotransposons. similar abiotic induction of retroelements in non-germline tissue has been described in solanaceous species and the aba-induction of the tnt1a promoter in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the unstressed berry cluster possessed overrepresented transcripts encoding genes with functions involved in primary metabolism, translation, cell wall-related proteins , and transport  . in contrast, the stressed berry cluster  had the highest proportion of genes annotated as "stress-responsive"  including overrepresented transcripts encoding xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases, a dead box rna helicase, and seed storage proteins including albumins and globulins and several highly abundant unknown proteins .

correlation with microarray data
next, differences in transcript expression patterns estimated by est frequency were compared with a second platform, the affymetrix® vitis genechip® microarray. of the  <dig> transcripts described above, microarray probeset identifiers could be assigned for  <dig> of them. all differentially expressed genes available from microarray experiments in which similar stresses were imposed were collected. for leaf tissue, within which our stressed leaf library included a mixture of drought, nacl, heat, and light stressed tissue, two experiments were used as a source for microarray data: an experiment in which drought and salt stress were applied over a  <dig> d period  <cit>  and an experiment that analyzed rapid changes  in gene expression under osmotic stress , nacl, and chilling exposure  <cit> . for the berry libraries, microarray data from a drought stressed berry time course experiment of chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon  <cit>  were compared with est frequency data. following the example of van ruissen and colleagues  <cit> , probeset expression values were then compared with est frequencies using only those probesets for which significant differences were observed between stressed and unstressed tissues in the original microarray experiments. using this method,  <dig> comparisons of significantly different changes were plotted . overall correlation between the microarray and frequency-based expression measures was modest. the non-parametric spearman rank correlation was modestly positive, at , but with a p <  <dig> , indicating that this similarity, while modest, is extremely unlikely to be due to chance alone. pearson correlation was similar . in other studies comparing microarray to est or similar tag-based technologies, modest spearman and pearson correlations have been observed  <cit> . following the example of li and colleagues, the directional concordance, which is the directional agreement in either increased or decreased relative transcript abundance in response to stress treatment, among the  <dig> significant genes common to both microarray or est sampling detection methods was determined. in their comparison of sage tags with microarrays in multiple human tissues, these authors found 75% directional concordance among significant genes  <cit> . similarly, for our  <dig> shared genes, the directional concordance was 69% or more than two agreements per disagreement.

in order to verify the gene expression ratios determined by microarray analysis, qrt-pcr was performed on the set of genes listed in additional file  <dig>  these genes were selected at random and represented genes expressed preferentially in either leaf or berry tissues. relative mrna expression for  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts was assayed in drought-stressed and well-watered berry tissue and leaf tissue, respectively. a linear regression of the log2-ratios of those genes found strong correlation between transcript abundance measured by microarray and qrt-pcr methods  and a very high degree of directional concordance  .

identification of root-enriched genes
the  <dig>  ests sequenced from the normalized abiotic stressed cabernet sauvignon root cdna library  were matched to their vvgi ver.  <dig> consensus sequence contigs  <cit>  and, when possible, to the  <dig> x genomic gsviv gene/protein identifiers and matched with the annotation files associated with vitisnet  <cit> , resulting in the identification of  <dig> non-redundant transcripts. of these,  <dig> were mapped successfully to  <dig> x gsviv gene models, whereas the remaining  <dig> singletons and  <dig> vvgi contigs did not match gsviv gene models. the cdna library normalization method was successful in generating a highly complex library, with  <dig>  unique transcripts being represented by est singletons. annotation of the  <dig> non-redundant root transcripts revealed  <dig>  had known functions,  <dig>  matched a previously annotated gene model, but the function was unclear, and  <dig>  had unknown functions, with no homology matches to any previously described gene . the functional categories were assigned for the  <dig> transcripts with known functions . overall, the vvm normalized library contained a high diversity of transcripts with the functional categories of primary metabolism, signal transduction, and transport systems being well represented .

next, the  <dig>  vvm cabernet sauvignon root ests plus an additional  <dig> ests from two cabernet sauvignon root libraries  were analyzed for either root-specific or root-enriched transcripts. these root cdna libraries were compared with a total of  <dig>  ests from  <dig> libraries comprising the ncbi unigene dataset http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene/lbrowse <dig> cgi?taxid= <dig> <cit>  with the exception of five est libraries derived from in vitro or cell cultures , mixed organ  cdna libraries , or an amplified fragment length polymorphism  cdna library . relative est frequency counts were calculated as previously described using weighted averages for the combination of libraries grouped into either "root" or "non-root" groups. est frequency counts for genes with two or more ests within one or both of the library sets  and corresponding differential gene expression patterns were calculated with the ideg <dig> web tool using the audic-claverie statistic , p-value <  <dig> . bonferroni multiple-testing correction was applied to consider only p-values <  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  <cit> . the comparison of root ests against all non-root ests resulted in the initial identification of  <dig> genes that had p-values below the significance threshold. furthermore, the ac statistic identified  <dig> "root-enriched" transcripts that showed greater frequencies in root compared with non-root tissues as listed in table  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were identified as being enriched in the non-root libraries. because a normalized root cdna library was analyzed, these  <dig> genes were not considered further as the normalization process was expected to result in a systematic underrepresentation of highly abundant root transcripts. evaluation of the functional categories of the  <dig> root-enriched genes showed that genes for primary and secondary metabolism as well as transport processes were more numerous compared with the entire root est collection .

root-enriched genes were identified by est frequency comparison of vitis vinifera roots compared with all other tissues, using the audic-claverie  statistic  <cit> . gene identifier  from gsviv, gene description, gene function , frequency in root and non-root cdna libraries, and ac confidence statistic are presented. genes tested for root-enriched expression by real-time qrt-pcr are indicated in bold .

validation of root-enriched genes
in order to confirm root expression patterns estimated by est frequency, the expression of a set of putative root-specific or root-enriched genes was selected for validation by qrt-pcr. gene-specific primers were designed for ten of the  <dig> highly root-enriched transcripts. genes were selected not only for those with very high root est count, but also for those gene with lower frequencies, but still considered statistically significant. the gene-specific primers used are listed in additional file  <dig>  relative transcript abundance for each gene was tested within root and shoot tissue of cabernet sauvignon . two-way anova by gene and tissue was performed, and both were significant . after anova, individual bonferroni corrected t-statistics were computed for each individual gene between root and shoot tissues. of these ten transcripts, six were found to be significantly more abundant in roots than shoots by student's t-statistic . transcript abundances ranged from  <dig> - to 730-times greater abundance in roots than shoots.

the most highly root-enriched transcript encoded an uncharacterized vitis tonoplast intrinsic protein tip1; <dig>  and was detected at 730-times greater transcript abundance in roots than in shoot tissue. this correlates well with the estimated expression by est frequencies, where it was found with a frequency of ~ <dig>  tags per ten thousand  in roots compared with  <dig>  tp10k in non-root tissues . a resveratrol o-methyltransferase  that was found with a frequency of  <dig>  tp10k in roots  was expressed 120-fold greater in root than in shoot as estimated by qrt-pcr. similarly, a terpene synthase  gene, -alpha-farnesene synthase  <cit> , was found with a frequency of  <dig>  tp10k in roots  and was 44-fold more abundant in root than shoot as assessed by qrt-pcr. a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase  was expressed 27-fold greater in roots than in shoots. a flavonol 3-o-glucosyltransferase  showed a  <dig> -fold greater abundance in roots than in shoots. lastly, a myb transcription factor-like a gene  was tested to evaluate the selected significance cutoff. this transcript was detected at  <dig> -fold greater abundance in roots than in shoots . in contrast, three of the genes tested  failed to demonstrate a significant difference as measured by the multiple test-corrected t-statistic, and a single transcript, a second myb transcription factor-like b gene , was determined to be  <dig> -fold less abundant in roots than in shoots  . for all ten genes tested, the spearman rank correlation between the two measures of gene expression  was high . although only ten genes were tested, estimation of transcript abundance by est frequency was apparently effective in identifying genes with root-specific expression, despite the majority of root ests coming from a normalized library source.

discussion
data mining to discover vitis vinifera stress-adaptive genes
in order to identify novel transcripts that respond to multiple environmental stress treatments, est libraries generated by us and those derived from public sources were carefully curated and mined to obtain estimates of transcript abundance based on est frequencies. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique ests derived from non-normalized cdna libraries from mixed abiotic stress leaf and water-deficit stressed berry tissues, respectively, were compared with  <dig> and  <dig>  unique ests derived from cdna libraries generated with unstressed leaf and berry tissues . tag frequency-based detection of differentially expressed genes is a well-established methodology for ests  <cit> , sage  <cit> , and mpss  <cit> , and continues to be an important tool in the era of "next-generation" deep sequencing of transcriptomes  <cit> . aside from the removal of redundant ests derived from bi-directional and/or same direction resequencing of individual cdna clones, one of the main issues encountered during the data curation process was the discovery of various types of naming errors within and across plated clone libraries. with the aid of a simple dot-plot method analogous to that used for local nucleotide sequence alignments  <cit> , gene ids could be aligned and readily visualized to discover incorrectly paired plates  containing "well slip" naming errors that would have overestimated the number of ests actually present within a particular cdna library of interest due to duplicated sequencing of plates within the same library . application of this technique also allowed for the discovery of a misassigned plate of ests from a leaf cdna library to a berry cdna library, an error that would have confounded the accuracy of est counting with regard to a particular tissue .

comparing est frequency counts from cdna libraries of mixed or water-deficit stressed leaf and berry tissues, respectively, with those from cdna libraries from unstressed leaf and berry tissues, a total of  <dig> transcripts were identified and clustered into four main clusters . of these,  <dig>  transcripts could be annotated and assigned to functional categories . each cluster contained distinct functional groups that reflected clearly the tissue type and treatment condition in question. for example, transcripts encoding the cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig>  were overrepresented in both the stressed leaf  and stressed berries  clusters. cipk <dig> participates in the calcineurin b-like  calcium sensor protein-cipk network that decodes calcium signals in response to environmental perturbations  <cit> . the arabidopsis cipk <dig> is localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm when expressed as a gfp fusion in nicotiana benthamiana leaves  <cit> . cbl-cipk interactions are crucial for the regulation of ion homeostasis during salinity stress and other forms of environmental stress, not only at the plasma membrane and tonoplast, but also at the cytoplasm, and nucleus  <cit> . the increased abundance of cipk <dig> transcripts in these stress-specific cdna libraries indicates this cipk might play a role in stress adaptation in both vitis leaves and berries. several other stress-specific transcripts appeared to be over-represented in both stress libraries including rd <dig>  a salt-, dehydration-, and aba-responsive gene in grape berries  <cit>  . in addition to the genes discussed earlier that were enriched within the stressed berry  cluster, several pathogenesis-related  proteins, such as three thaumatin genes, a class iv chitinase gene, two osmotin genes, and snakin- <dig>  a cysteine-rich peptide that exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro and fungal and bacterial pathogen resistance in vivo  <cit> , were also enriched in this cluster. the identification of this collection of pr proteins using the est frequency counting approach outlined here clearly illustrates its practical utility in the discovery of genetic determinants important for biotic and abiotic stress responses. a large number of unknown genes with discrete, cluster-specific expression patterns were also identified, particularly within the stressed leaf  cluster. such unknown genes can serve as primary targets for future, detailed investigations into gene function.

validation of est frequency counts by microarray analysis
in order to validate the efficacy of the est frequency counting method,  <dig> out of  <dig> transcripts could be identified on the affymetrix® vitis genechip® microarray and thus compared using these two distinct technical approaches. the remaining  <dig> transcripts had no match, and thus, were potentially not described previously as being abiotic stress responsive in vitis. between the two platforms, expression data for  <dig> transcripts could be compared where significant differences in gene expression patterns were observed using both technologies. like previous reports comparing tag and hybridization measures  <cit> , a modest , but significant correlation between the two platforms was observed . further comparison between the two methods revealed a directional concordance of 69%, indicating that the two platforms agreed to a greater extent in terms of their general gene expression trends. what might account for these rather modest correlations? first, these low correlations might be related partly to differences in the reported magnitude of increased or decreased transcript abundance. however, for every two genes that were reported increased or decreased significantly by both platforms, one gene changed significantly in opposite directions . thus, magnitude can only account for part of the disagreement. second, the use of public data sets, which are highly diverse, might introduce biases in gene representation. in earlier studies that have mined public datasets, such as in a comparison of est reads generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing with microarray mrna profiles in two porcine tissues, four-to-one concordance  ratios were observed  <cit>  or in a comparison of sage tags with microarrays mrna profiles within a set of human tissues, three-to-one concordance ratios were observed  <cit> . in the present study, while major systematic errors within the public data sets were corrected in an attempt to capture correct frequency counts for unstressed leaf and berry libraries , these public data sets contained large differences in grapevine cultivar, age, developmental stage, season, terroir, and sample preparation that were likely to introduce biases in gene representation. third, the relative complexity of our mixed stress leaf library might be a source of bias, because the source tissue for this library included rna from uv- and heat-treated leaves, treatments for which corresponding microarray data were unavailable for comparison. the presence of genes strongly or exclusively regulated by uv or heat stress would be expected to contribute to the population of the significant-by-est transcripts with which no corresponding microarray data could be compared.

est-based gene discovery in vitis roots
to redress the relative paucity of available grape root sequence data, more than  <dig>  ests were generated from a normalized cdna library  constructed from cabernet sauvignon root tissues exposed to cold, salinity, and water deficit stress . during its preparation, this library was normalized with the aim of increasing the number of different and low-abundance root genes identified  <cit> . the  <dig>  ests assemble into  <dig> unique transcripts, of which  <dig>  were represented just once. because normalized libraries are biased, resulting in an under-counting of abundant transcripts and over-counting of rare ones, they violate the assumption of random sampling, and as such, are not usually considered for use in tag frequency analyses of gene expression  <cit> . recognizing that library normalization would, at a minimum, underestimate the true relative expression of most root transcripts, the identification of root-specific or root-abundant est was attempted by est frequency counting. a total of  <dig>  root-derived ests were compared with  <dig>  ests from  <dig> non-root cdna libraries. this analysis resulted in the identification of  <dig> "root-enriched" transcripts with significantly greater est frequencies in roots than other tissues as determined by the ac statistic . validation of a set of  <dig> candidate root genes with varying degrees of apparent root enrichment by qrt-pcr confirmed six genes to be significantly more abundant in grapevine roots than in shoots . the correlation between estimated est frequencies and qrt-pcr expression ratios was strong  and significant . shoot tissue was used to confirm broadly, but not exhaustively, that expression patterns were root-enhanced. confirmation of the root-specific expression patterns of these candidate genes will require that additional non-root tissue types  be tested on a gene-by-gene basis.

chief among the qrt-pcr-validated root genes is a gene encoding an aquaporin/tonoplast intrinsic protein 1; <dig>  that was expressed as much as 730-fold more in roots than in shoots. vvtip1; <dig> has been previously identified from genomic sequence by two groups  <cit> , but has not yet been characterized functionally. another root-enriched gene, which showed 120-fold greater mrna abundance in roots than in shoots by qrt-pcr, encodes a putative resveratrol-o-methyltransferase , which is 78% identical and 88% similar to a known vitis romt  <cit> . the romt characterized by schmidlin and colleagues was observed to doubly o-methylate molecules of resveratrol into pterostilbene, a phytoalexin with 5- <dig> times greater in vitro fungitoxicity than resveratrol  <cit> . this root-expressed romt is also structurally distinct from a romt recently characterized in red berries. the red berry romt transcript was more abundant in the red grape cabernet sauvignon than the white chardonnay and had peak expression two weeks after véraison in the red cultivar only  <cit> . a terpene synthase  was highly expressed in roots with a 44-fold greater relative abundance in root than in shoots. martin and colleagues identified this tps to be an -alpha-farnesene synthase in a thorough survey to characterize v. vinifera tps genes  <cit> . this tps exhibited activity that was unique among the  <dig> characterized, producing only -alpha-farnesene when fed farnesene diphosphate , rather than a mixture of multiple products. a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase  gene was also confirmed to be 27-fold more abundant in roots than in shoots. cad genes are crucial for the synthesis of the lignin compounds in wood formation, but some cad genes might possess other activities or functions. in arabidopsis, the activity of the promoters of some atcad genes has been observed in cells where cad-mediated lignification does not appear to take place, including young root tips  <cit> . lastly, an udp-glucose o-glucosyltransferase  gene was  <dig> -fold more abundant in roots than in shoots. when compared to the position-specific scoring matrices  found in ncbi's conserved domain database   <cit> , this ugt was most similar to the pln <dig> group of ugts, which are classified as flavonol 3-o-glucosyltransferases . however, determining the exact catalytic activities of ugts generally requires biochemical characterization as even single amino acid changes in ugt proteins can alter regioselectivity  or udp-sugar substrate preference  <cit> . four other candidate genes were also surveyed, but none were found to exhibit significant, root-enriched mrna expression at p <  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
abiotic stresses, especially water-deficit stress, have major impacts on vine growth and berry development that ultimately can impact wine quality. here, est frequency counts were exploited to identify candidate genes with mrna expression profiles altered by abiotic stresses by comparing large est collections from cdna libraries prepared from leaf and berries harvested from vines subjected to mixed abiotic stresses to publicly available est collections from these same tissues harvested from unstressed vines. this analysis identified  <dig> transcripts with significant differential expression in abiotically stressed leaves and berries. comparison of est frequency counts of these genes with available microarray expression data identified  <dig> genes, which also showed significant differences between stressed, and unstressed tissues. while the correlation in expression patterns was modest at best, 69% of genes exhibited directional concordance. furthermore, the est frequency counting approach led to the identification of many novel candidate genes whose stress-induced mrna expression patterns had not been described previously. to identify genes preferentially or exclusively expressed in vitis roots, a tissue that had previously been largely uncharacterized,  <dig>  est were characterized from a normalized, abiotically stressed cdna library from cabernet sauvignon. comparison of these ests with publicly available est collections from non-root tissues allowed for the identification of  <dig> root-enriched transcripts, a majority of which showed root-preferential mrna expression when validated by qrt-pcr. this root-enriched est collection will serve as a rich resource not only for future studies into the abiotic stress-response networks operating within roots, but also for future genotyping efforts of vitis rootstock that differ in salinity or drought tolerance characteristics or for manipulation of root stock traits in wine grape.
