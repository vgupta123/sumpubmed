BACKGROUND
with the completion of genome sequences of many species, comparative analysis of these organisms becomes increasingly important in understanding the function and evolution of genes and proteins. comparison of the genome sequences between worm and yeast has revealed that most of the core biological functions were carried out by orthologous proteins, and that the multi-cellular worm had more diverse proteins than the unicellular yeast  <cit> . in addition, more than  <dig> bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic genomes have been analyzed for protein function prediction, phylogenetic profiling of domains, and eukaryotic-signature domain organizations  <cit> .

the development of high-throughput technologies such as yeast two-hybrid assays has produced large scale protein interaction data sets for several species, and significant efforts have been made to analyze them. by combining protein interaction data sets and orthology information on yeast protein sequences and a bacterial pathogen, kelley et al.  <cit>  and sharan et al.  <cit>  identified conserved protein interaction pathways and complexes. further studies on conserved protein complexes and functional modules can be found in  <cit> .

the basic units of proteins are domains and proteins interact with each other through their domains. therefore, it is crucial to understand protein interactions at the level of the domains  <cit> . several groups have developed methods to understand domain interactions based on protein interactions. sprinzak and margalit  <cit>  selected domain interaction pairs based on the frequency of observed protein interactions that contain the pair of domains over its expect value. deng et al.  <cit>  developed a maximum likelihood estimation  method and an expectation-maximization  algorithm to infer underlying domain interactions from protein interactions. liu et al.  <cit>  extended the mle method to combine protein interactions from multiple species, and showed that the extension resulted in a higher accuracy in predicting protein interactions than using the yeast protein interactions alone. liu et al.  <cit>  also showed that, for a single species, the approach by deng et al.  <cit>  was comparable to that of gomez et al.  <cit>  and outperformed those of the sprinzak and margalit  <cit>  and the gomez et al.  <cit>  for predicting protein interactions. more recently, riley et al.  <cit>  modified the deng et al.  <cit>  approach to be applicable to all the protein interactions in dip  <cit>  assuming no false positives and false negatives. most importantly, they presented a new score for domain interactions, the e-score, defined as the log likelihood ratio of the observed interactions assuming the domain pairs interact over assuming the domain pairs do not interact. they showed that the e-score outperformed the deng et al.  <cit>  method in predicting domain interactions. other approaches for predicting domain interactions using multiple data sources were developed in  <cit> . in this study, we focus on the integration of multiple data sources from multiple species to predict high-confidence domain interactions. first, we calculate the probability of domain interactions from four species: yeast  <cit> , worm  <cit> , fruitfly  <cit>  and humans  <cit> , respectively. using these probabilities, we compute the expected number of interactions for each pair of domains within a species. second, we investigate information on protein fusion and the domain functions. third, a bayesian approach is used to integrate those data sources to predict high-confidence domain interactions. these predictions help us to unravel the domain interactions in protein complexes and protein interactions. our study differs from previous studies in several significant ways. compared to liu et al. and ng et al.  <cit> , our approach develop a new measure to score domain-domain interactions and validate it with experimentally derived domain interactions instead of using indirect ways such as validating re-inferred protein interactions. compared to riley et al.  <cit> , protein fusion and gene ontology   <cit>  functions are also integrated using a bayesian approach. we show that the integration significantly increases the accuracy of predicted domain-domain interactions.

the paper is organized as follows. in the methods section, we present the various data sources used in our analysis, followed by the methods for analyzing an integration of the different data sources. in the results section, we present the results based on the various data sources separately, followed by the results based on integrated analysis. we evaluate our results by comparing with the domain-domain interactions in ipfam. finally, we show limitations of our approach and further studies.

methods
data sources
in this study, we collect protein interactions and protein domain information from various databases for yeast, worm, fruitfly, and humans. protein domain information is based on the pfam-a domains  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the number of proteins and protein interactions used in this study. because only a subset of proteins contain pfam-a domains, we use this subset along withtheir protein interactions in this study.

protein interactions for yeast and worm
we download the protein interaction data sets for yeast and worm from the dip database  <cit> . each protein is associated with a dip number, swissprot id, gi number, etc. we use the swissprot accession numbers to associate domain information from the pfam database  <cit>  with the proteins in the dip. we also use the gi numbers to obtain additional pfam domain information from the national center for biotechnology information  <cit> . for worm, the domain information collected using the gi numbers increases the number of protein interactions with domain information.

protein interactions for fruitfly
we obtain the protein interaction data set for fruitfly from giot et al.  <cit> . in this data set, protein names are identified by cg numbers. to obtain the relationship between proteins and domains, we associate the cg numbers with the swissprot accession numbers by the protein table integr <dig> in embl-ebi  <cit> . the compiled swissprot accession numbers are used to extract protein-domain relationship from the pfam database.

protein interactions for human
we obtain the human protein interaction data set from the human protein reference database   <cit> , which contains protein-protein interactions from individual small-scale experiments published in theliterature. the proteinsare identified by np numbers. we associate the np numbers in the hprd with the swissprot accession numbers using the protein table integr <dig> in embl-ebi, and then extractprotein-domain relationship from the pfam database.

domain functions
we obtain domain functions, biological process, using the mapping table from pfam to go in the gene ontology webpage  <cit>  and use the domains in the table to compile domain pairs with the same function.

domain fusion
we use protein-domain information in pfam-a to identify pairs of domains co-existing in one protein. the method is referred to as domain fusion in the rest of the paper.

databases of domain interactions
we use two structure based domain interactions: ipfam  <cit>  and protein quaternary structure   <cit>  to estimate the reliability of predicted domain-domain interactions. ipfam contains  <dig>  domain interactions. the domain interactions in ipfam are obtained by calculating all bonds between all pairs of residues between domains based on the protein structures in protein data bank . pqs provides probable quaternary states for structures based on pdb. in pqs, the analysis of determining biologically relevant interactions and crystal packing is attempted based on some known properties such as hydrophobicity, shape analysis, and the size of the solvent-accessible surface area . note that biologically relevant domain interactions and crystal contacts are not distinguished in ipfam. as domains in pqs are annotated by scop superfamily, we associate them with the pfam domains using the mapping table in the scop webpage  <cit> . finally, we obtain  <dig>  domain interactions.

computational methods
in this subsection, we describe  the computational methods for calculating the probability of domain-domain interactions,  a new measure to evaluate the strength of domain-domain interactions, and  a bayesian method for integrating different data sources to construct a high-confidence set of domain-domain interactions.

the maximum likelihood estimation for probabilities of domain-domain interactions
the maximum likelihood estimation method proposed by deng et al.  <cit>  has been shown to have good performance in estimating the probabilities of domain-domain interactions. we adopt this method in this study and briefly describe the method as follows.

the basic assumption of the mle method is that two proteins interact if and only if at least one pair of domains from each of the two proteins interact. given two proteins pi and pj, the probability that they interact is



where pij =  <dig> if they interact and  <dig> otherwise, and dmn ∈ ij denotes that domains dm and dn belong to proteins pi and pj, respectively, and dmn =  <dig> if domain dm interacts with domain dn. for an experiment in a species, the false positive rate  is defined as the probability that two non-interacting proteins were observed to interact and the false negative rate  is defined as the probability that two truly interacting proteins were not observed to interact in the experiment. let oij =  <dig> if the interaction between proteins pi and pj is observed and oij =  <dig> otherwise. thus, the probability for the observed protein interaction is

pr = pr + )fp.     

the likelihood function-the probability of the whole interaction data set is

l=∏ij)oij)1−oij.

our objective is to maximize the likelihood l, which can be represented as the function of p with fixed fp and fn by incorporating equations  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  p can be estimated by an expectation-maximization  algorithm  <cit> . deng et al.  <cit>  presented a method to approximate the values of fn and fp based on the number of observed interactions. we combine this idea and the reliability of protein interaction data sets to approximate values of fn and fp in each species used in this study. the results are shown in table  <dig>  the details are presented in the additional file  <dig> 

the expected number of occurrences of domain interactions
deng et al.  <cit>  used the estimated value of p to rank domain-domain interactions. one problem of the approach is that the estimated value of p is generally large if  each of the two domains appears only in one protein,  each of these two proteins contains only one domain, and  these two proteins interact. another problem is that the value of p is generally small if  both domains appear in many proteins and  only a small proportion of these pairs of proteins having these two domains interact.

in order to overcome these problems, we score each domain pairs by the expected number of occurrences of domain interactions.

e = nmn pr,     

where nmn is the number of protein pairs having domains dm and dn. our intuition is that if a pair of domains are observed in multiple protein interactions, this pair of domains are more likely to interact. we use e() as a feature in our integrative model.

domain fusion
in addition to the protein interaction data, we also incorporate information on domain fusion and domain function to build a set of high-confidence domain-domain interactions. enright et al.  <cit>  and marcotte et al.  <cit>  showed that two proteins are more likely to interact if they are fused into one protein in another species. this idea can be further extended to domains in that if two domains are fused in one protein in any species, they are more likely to interact. thus, we search proteins having multiple pfam-a domains and  <dig>  pfam-a domain pairs that co-exist in the same proteins are obtained. we define ce, where ce stands for co-existence, as the number of occurrences that domain dm and domain dn co-exist in the same proteins. it is expected that if ce is larger, domain dm and domain dn are more likely to interact. we use ce() as a feature in our integrative model.

domain functions
we obtain gene ontology terms of domains and find  <dig>  domain pairs having the same go terms in the category of the biological process. the gene ontology has a hierarchical structure , where the parents denote functions of more general terms and the offsprings represent functions of more specific terms. it is expected that two domains participating in the same go function  are more likely to interact than they do in different functions. moreover, two domains participating in a more specific function are more likely to interact than they do in a more general function. a more specific function generally covers a smaller number of domains. assume that domain dm and domain dn have the same function ff. we define sg, where sg stands for the same gene ontology, as the number of domains having the function ff. we use sg() as a feature in our integrative model.

integrating multiple data sources
the six information sources can be combined to construct a high-confidence set of domain-domain interactions. several heuristic methods can be used for data integration. here we consider three approaches: evidence counting, naïve bayesian, and logistic regression.

for each pair of domains, six information sources for their interaction can be obtained from the analysis of the expected number of domain interactions derived from protein interactions of four species, the number of occurrences in the domain fusion, and the number of domains with the same go annotation. we applied the aforementioned three computational methods to integrate these six biological evidences to predict domain interactions. the methods are described as follows.

evidence counting
the number of evidences supporting domain interactions is used to score domain pairs for potential interactions. for a pair of domains dm and dn, we say that the interaction between dm and dn is supported by the yeast protein interactions if the expected number of occurrences of domain interactions is at least  <dig>  i.e e ≥  <dig>  we count this as one evidence. a domain interaction can have a maximum of  <dig> evidences from yeast, worm, fruitfly and humans. similarly, we say that the interaction between dm and dn is supported by the domain fusion if ce ≥  <dig>  and by the domain functions if sg ≥  <dig>  the number of evidences for a pair of domains ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> 

naïve bayesian
the naïve bayesian approach assumes the independence of data sources, and has been applied to the integration of multiple data sources for predicting protein interactions  <cit> . the basic idea is to calculate the likelihood ratio of each of the six evidences and then multiply these likelihood ratios. we define the set of observed interactions  as the interacting domain pairs in ipfam and the set of non-observed interactions  as the domain pairs not presented in ipfam. the likelihood ratio for six data sources are calculated as follows. for each species, we split the values of e into  <dig> intervals. we call an interval as a bin, and this process as a binning process. let d = e and d falls into the t-th bin. let pr be the fraction of the observed interactions in the t-th bin and let pr be the fraction of the non-observed interactions in the t-th bin. then, the likelihood ratio for the t-th bin is pr/pr. similarly, we bin the values of ce and sg and then calculate the likelihood ratio for each of them. additional file  <dig> shows the likelihood ratios for each data source. let d <dig> ..., d <dig> be the values of e in yeast, worm, fruitfly, and humans, respectively, and let d <dig> and d <dig> be the values of ce and sg, respectively. then, the total likelihood ratio is

validating the predicted domain interactions
to evaluate the reliability of the predicted domain interactions, we compare them with the domain interactions in ipfam. the interactions in ipfam are treated as the observed interactions. although many domain interactions are not included in the database, a good score function for domain interactions should include a higher fraction of observed interactions in the highest ranked predictions than a random scoring function. therefore, for a given scoring range, the fraction of the observed interactions among all domain pairs having scores within the range is calculated. we also calculate the ratio of this fraction over that from a random scoring function and refer to it as the fold value. for a good score function, the fold value should increase with the score.

another method to evaluate the reliability of predicted domain interactions is using the receiver operating characteristic  curve representing the relationship between false positive rate  and sensitivity . as we mentioned before, we use domain pairs in ipfam as the observed interactions and domain pairs not in ipfam as the non-observed interactions. because this gives too many non-observed interactions , we randomly remove domain pairs without any evidence and finally obtain  <dig>  domain pairs, about twice of the number of domain pairs with at least one evidence, for the non-observed set. for a given threshold value t, domain pairs with score larger than t are predicted as interacting and others as non-interacting. the results can be represented as

the fpr and sn are defined as

fpr=fpfp+tn,sn=tptp+fn.

we use five-fold cross-validation to compare the performance. we use a subset of ipfam domain interactions for training to calculate the likelihood ratio of the bayesian approach and the coefficients of the logistic regression. the remaining ipfam domain interactions are used for testing.

RESULTS
conserved domain interactions across multiple species
we first show that domain interactions inferred from multiple species are reliable. the four species share many domains. table  <dig> shows the number of proteins, the numbers of protein-protein interactions, and the numbers of domains in each species. figure  <dig> shows the numbers of domains overlapped among the different species. most domains appear in more than one species. for example,  <dig> out of  <dig>  domains in yeast  are found in at least one of the other three species. similarly,  <dig> out of  <dig> domains in worm  are found in other species. for fruitfly and humans, 82% and 68% are found in other species, respectively.

we apply the mle method to calculate probabilities of domain interactions. the numbers of domain interactions obtained  for yeast, worm, fruitfly, and humans are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. figure  <dig> shows the numbers of predicted domain interactions among four species together with the overlaps.  <dig>  out of a total of  <dig>  predicted domain interactions from the four species are presented in at least two species, which we call predicted conserved domain interactions. although this fraction is relatively small, we find that this fraction is still three times higher than that of random interactions . this result is consistent with other studies  <cit> , which found only a small percentage of conserved protein interactions across several species. we compare these  <dig> domain interactions with ipfam. table  <dig> shows that, surprisingly,  <dig> % of the  <dig> conserved domain interactions are found in ipfam, compared to only  <dig> % for all of the predicted  <dig>  domain interactions. furthermore, 50% of the domain interactions presented in all four species belong to ipfam. the results suggest that the predicted conserved domain interactions obtained from at least two species are very reliable. similar results are obtained  by comparing the predicted conserved domain interactions with domain interactions obtained from the protein quaternary structure  database  <cit> . the list of predicted conserved domain interactions from at least three species is presented in additional file  <dig> 

contributions of each data source to the accuracy of predicted domain interactions
we first evaluate the contributions of each of the six information sources to the accuracy of predicted domain-domain interactions by comparing with the domain interactions in ipfam. to score domain interactions based on protein interactions, three measures are considered. the first measure is based on the estimated value of the probability of domain interactions ). the second is the number of times the domain pairs occur in protein pairs . the last is the multiplication of the first two, nmnp. these measures are referred as probability, frequency, and expectation, respectively. we also compare with another measure defined as e-value by  <cit> . the performance of each score function is evaluated by the true positive rate ) among the top r ranked domain pairs. for each score function and a rank value r, domain pairs with the top r ranked scores are predicted as interacting. the predicted domain interactions are compared with domain interactions in ipfam. figure  <dig> shows the relationship between the true positive rate and the rank r based on the four different score functions. for given r, the fractions of observed interactions among the top r ranked domain pairs based on expectation and e-value are higher than that based on probability and frequency. figure  <dig> indicates that the scores based on expectation and e-value have similar performance and outperform the other two scores in evaluating domain interactions. as another way of comparison, we also draw roc curves based on the four score functions and they are given in additional file  <dig>  the relative performance of the four score measures based on roc curves is similar as above.

we next consider the relationship between domain fusion and domain interactions. similar ideas have been applied to e. coli and s. cerevisiae to infer protein interactions  <cit> . from pfam, we collect  <dig>  pfam-a domain pairs that co-exist in the same proteins, among which  <dig>  overlap with ipfam .  <dig> domain pairs found through domain fusion are found to interact within at least one species based on protein interaction data, among which  <dig>  overlap with ipfam. the results suggest that the co-existence of domain pairs is a reliable evidence for domain interactions and combining multiple evidences reduces the number of false positives.

we also incorporate information on domain pairs with the same go annotations. it is known that proteins having similar functions are more likely to interact  <cit> . in fact, the observation is true for domains as well. we find  <dig>  domain pairs having the same go terms in the category of biological process.  <dig>  domain pairs are also found in predicted domain interactions based on protein interaction data, among which  <dig>  domain interactions are found in ipfam .

integration of multiple biological data sources
we integrate six data sources using different methods described in the methods section, and compare the performance using a five-fold cross-validation. we first show the improvement of integrating multiple biological data sources. table  <dig> shows the percentages of overlaps between ipfam and the predicted domain interactions with multiple evidences. the results indicate that one single evidence is not sufficient for predicting domain interactions as only  <dig> % of these domain interactions overlap with ipfam. however, the percentage of overlaps increases to  <dig> % for domain interactions with two or more evidences. as the number of evidences increases, the predictions are more accurate but, the number of predictions decreases at the same time. only  <dig> predicted domain interactions have four or more evidences and  <dig> out of  <dig>  belong to ipfam.

we compare the power of the three methods for predicting domain interactions: evidence counting, naïve bayesian, and logistic regression. figure  <dig> shows the roc curves for the three methods. it is clear that the bayesian approach outperforms the other two. the evidence counting method does not consider the quality of each data sources, and the logistic regression method is limited by many missing values. finally, we select a set of  <dig>  high-confidence domain interactions having the likelihood ratio value at least  <dig>  among which more than half  are found in the ipfam. this set covers  <dig> % of the data in ipfam with a false positive rate of  <dig> %. we list the top  <dig> predicted domain interactions that are not found in ipfam  in table  <dig>  among them, three were later included in the updated version of ipfam , showing the reliability of the high-confidence domain interactions. the list of the high-confidence domain interactions is shown in additional file  <dig> and likelihood ratio values of  <dig>  domain pairs are given in additional file  <dig>  in these tables, the domain pairs are sorted based on the bayesian approach. the rankings by the three methods, the bayesian approach, the logistic regression, and the evidence counting, are also presented to show the similarity of three methods. we test the differences of the rankings of the  <dig>  domain pairs by three methods using the wilcox rank sum test based on the null hypothesis of no difference between rankings. all three p-values are around  <dig> , showing that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. however, it does not indicate that the rankings by three approaches are similar. the roc curves in figure  <dig> show that the top ranked domain pairs by three methods are different.

comparison with domain interactions in h. pylori
rain et al.  <cit>  reported a protein-protein interaction data set for h. pylori using yeast two hybrid assays. this data set provides the ranges of sequences of the prey proteins interacting with the bait proteins. we map these ranges in the preys to the pfam-a domains when the overlap between them is larger than 50% of the pfam domains. as we do not have such information for the baits, we assume that all domains in the baits interact with the specific site of the preys. we obtain a total of  <dig>  interactions between pfam-a domains. note that the domain interactions from h. pylori may contain false positives as the interacting domains in the baits are not known. we compare our predicted domain interactions from the six data sources using the bayesian approach with the experimentally derived domain interactions from h. pylori. for comparison, we use a subset of the predicted domain interactions with domains involved in domain interactions in h. pylori. additional file  <dig> shows the percentages of overlaps between the domain interactions from h. pylori and the predicted domain interactions. the fraction of domain pairs overlapped with the domain interactions in h. pylori increases as the likelihood ratio score increases, confirming the accuracy of the predicted domain interactions.

we also study our scoring algorithm using the h. pylori database. we infer domain interactions from h. pylori protein interactions using four scoring functions and compare the predicted domain interactions with the domain interactions from h. pylori. the number of domains in h. pylori is  <dig> and 848*849/ <dig> =  <dig>  are potential interacting pairs. from the expectation scoring function, we obtain  <dig>  predicted domain interactions . among them,  <dig> predicted domain interactions overlap with the  <dig>  domain interactions in h. pylori. additional file  <dig> shows that true positive rate is around  <dig>  in  <dig>  ranked domain interactions, showing the accuracy of the scoring functions.

domain interactions in yeast complexes
we apply the set of high-confidence domain interactions to examine the detailed protein and domain interactions in yeast complexes  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows two examples of protein complexes. figure  <dig> is the scf  complex. scf is a multi-protein complex with cdc <dig>  skp <dig>  and at least three independent f-box proteins, cdc <dig>  met <dig>  and grr <dig>  <cit> . this complex acts as a ubiquitin ligase catalyzing the final ubiquitin-transfer reaction in the destruction of g1/s-cyclins. our prediction of domain interaction is consistent with the literature in that only domain pf <dig>  of f-box proteins such as cdc <dig>  met <dig>  and grr <dig> interact with domain pf <dig> of protein skp <dig>  domain pf <dig>  and domain pf <dig>  do not participate in protein-protein interactions. patton et al.  <cit>  suggested that cdc <dig> is a scaffold protein for cdc <dig> and skp <dig> by showing that it has independent binding sites for cdc <dig> and skp <dig>  our result also shows that the domain pf <dig> in the protein cdc <dig> has interaction with both the domain pf <dig> of the protein cdc <dig> and the domain pf <dig> of the protein skp <dig>

the basic units of proteins are domains. if two proteins interact, at least one pair of domains from each of the two proteins interact. however, current biotechnologies such as the yeast-two-hybrid system can only detect protein interactions and it is tedious and labor intensive to derive domain interactions. the prediction of domain interactions based on protein interactions from one species has been formulated as a missing value problem and an em algorithm has been developed to achieve this objective  <cit> . the method has been modified to integrate protein interaction data sets from multiple species and the results have been improved  <cit> . in this study, we further explore the problem of domain-domain interactions from multiple data sources including protein interactions from four species; yeast, worm, fruitfly, and humans, as well as domain fusion and domain function information. we first provide a score function, the expected number of domain-domain interactions in the observed interactions, to infer the reliability of domain interactions. by comparing with domain interactions in ipfam, we show that the new score outperforms the score of deng et al.  <cit>  for predicting domain interactions. the true positive rate among highly ranked domain interactions predicted from the new score is higher than that from deng et al.  <cit> . we further show that, by including the domain fusion and gene ontology information, the accuracy of the predicted domain interactions can be significantly increased. we also show that the simple naïve bayesian approach works well to combine multiple biological information for predicting high-confidence domain interactions. there are several limitations of this study. first, we did not include all the interaction data from all the species as riley et al.  <cit>  did. the reason is that the size of data in other species is much smaller than those in the four species. second, the protein interaction data sets used in this study are incomplete and contain many false positives. additional file  <dig> shows the roc curves of the prediction results using various values of false positive  and false negative . in particular, we compared the result based on the fp and fn values presented in table  <dig> with the result based on fp = fn =  <dig> used in riley et al.  <cit> . depending on species, the former approach is sometimes better than or similar to the latter approach, and sometimes is worse. third, although we have shown that the naïve bayesian approach outperforms the evidence counting and the logistic regression methods, there is room to improve the prediction by considering the correlations between data sources.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the likelihood ratio score provides a mean for evaluating the reliability of domain interactions. based on the likelihood ratio score, we have derived a set of high-confidence domain interactions. this set has important implication in understanding protein functions at the domain level as well as in understanding protein interactions.
