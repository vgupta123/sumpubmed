BACKGROUND
cellular senescence is controlled through a variety of regulatory mechanisms with particular contribution of the p <dig>  <cit>  and rb  <cit>  tumor suppressor pathways. briefly, p <dig> is activated in response to telomere damage or other kinds of dna damage and orchestrates the transcriptional activation of a variety of downstream genes contributing to growth arrest, such as the cdk inhibitor p21waf <dig>  in a parallel pathway, upregulation of the cdk inhibitor p16ink4a leads to the inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein , thereby enforcing prolonged cell cycle arrest  <cit> , which is also a useful marker for senescence in human tissues  <cit> . activation of p16ink4a triggers the appearance of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci  <cit> , at least in some cell types. activation of the p53/p21waf <dig> and p16ink4a/prb pathways represent two alternative scenarios for senescence initiation, and there is evidence that parallel activation of both pathways leads to enforced senescence  <cit> , also referred to as “deep senescence”  <cit> . the relative importance of each of these pathways for cellular senescence seems to depend on the cell type. it should be noted that, besides these central pathways, a variety of signals have been shown to initiate a senescence response  <cit> .

stress-induced premature senescence  has been identified as a model for telomere-independent senescence that can be initiated by various forms of stress, including oxidative stress, irradiation, replicative stress and oncogene activation  <cit> . in the case of skin derived human diploid fibroblasts , repeated mild treatment with uvb has been established as an experimental model for extrinsic skin aging  <cit> , which depends on the accumulation of senescent cells, in particular fibroblasts in the dermis  <cit> . uvb irradiation is known to induce aspects of a dna damage response, and it was reported that knocking down p <dig> alleviates but does not abrogate the senescence response of hdf to repeated uvb stress  <cit> , suggesting that both p53-dependent and -independent pathways may cooperate to enforce uvb-induced senescence. however, uvb irradiation is known to affect a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways  <cit>  and the precise sequence of events during establishment of uvb-induced premature senescence remained elusive.

recent studies have emphasized an important role of non-coding rnas, also referred to as micrornas, as regulators of gene expression  <cit> . micrornas are generated from larger precursor rnas and were shown to interfere with the expression of protein coding genes by several mechanisms, including i) destabilization of specific mrnas and ii) prevention of translation of specific mrnas. messenger rnas targeted by micrornas usually contain short sequences of homology  <cit> . it is known that changes in microrna expression are contributing to cellular senescence  <cit>  and organismic aging  <cit> ; however, the role of micrornas, if any, in uvb-induced senescence of human fibroblasts is only poorly understood. in the present communication, we have addressed molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of premature senescence in human fibroblasts exposed to repeated series of mild uvb irradiations, as a model system to monitor molecular processes involved in extrinsic skin aging. we identified a small set of micrornas, which are differentially regulated during the process and performed transcriptome analysis, in combination with advanced bioinformatics, to identify potential targets for these micrornas.

RESULTS
uvb-induced changes in gene expression
human diploid fibroblasts  derived from newborn foreskin were subjected to eight consecutive uvb treatments of 4000 j/m <dig> during four days. under these conditions no overt cell death was observed . cell proliferation was strongly inhibited, and uvb-treated cells performed less than  <dig> population doublings  over 15 days of the experiment, whereas untreated cells underwent  <dig> pdl in the same time period. the growth arrest phenotype reached by repeated mild uvb stress resembled cellular senescence, as judged by the changes of cell morphology and the accumulation of a large percentage of cells that stained positive for senescence-associated β-galactosidase  . as could be expected, uvb treatment led to a strong but transient phosphorylation of p <dig> on serine  <dig>  most notable at day  <dig>  i.e. after application of the last stress, indicative of p <dig> activation, consistent with previous observations  <cit> . the overall levels of p <dig> protein were also increased, in line with previous findings  <cit> . activation of p <dig> also resulted in the upregulation of its downstream effector p21waf <dig>  which is known to enforce cellular senescence in response to dna damage  <cit> . we also addressed effects of uvb treatment on the p16ink4a/prb pathway, representing the other important pathway relevant for cellular senescence  <cit> . as could be expected from the observed upregulation of p21waf <dig>  uvb treatment led to the rapid disappearance of phosphorylated species of the retinoblastoma protein , which was accompanied by a delayed but significant upregulation of the cdk inhibitor p16ink4a . together the data suggest that mild uvb stress induces premature cellular senescence and that both the p53/p21waf <dig> axis and the p16ink4a/prb pathway are involved in the senescence response, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . the same protocol of repeated mild uvb stress induced premature senescence also in two other strains of human diploid fibroblasts, hff- <dig> and pff, with a very similar kinetics , along with the activation of the p53/p21waf <dig> and prb/p16ink4a pathways .

to characterize the response of hdf to uvb-induced premature senescence, genome-wide transcriptome analysis was performed at various time points. applying a cutoff of >  <dig>  fold regulation, this analysis revealed the upregulation of  <dig> genes and the downregulation of another  <dig> genes in response to mild uvb treatment. changes in gene expression level were most pronounced at days  <dig> and  <dig> after beginning of the treatment. initial analysis of uvb-responsive pathways by ingenuity™ software, based on the results of affymetrix chip analyses, revealed several distinct molecular pathways preferentially affected by the treatment, including g1/s cell cycle checkpoint, dna damage checkpoint, p <dig> signaling pathway, cell migration, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, pyrimidine metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism . for day  <dig> after uvb irradiation, three independent affymetrix chip experiments were performed, which revealed significant upregulation  for a total of  <dig> genes, whereas  <dig> genes were significantly downregulated . the list of all regulated genes and corresponding affymetrix expression data are provided as additional file 4: table s <dig>  from these genes, a set of  <dig> genes was selected for an independent analysis by rt-qpcr, which confirmed all regulations revealed by affymetrix chips .

micrornas regulated in uvb-induced senescence
we also determined the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas in uvb treated compared to control cells. the relative expression levels of mirnas at various time points after uvb stress, as determined by mirna array, are shown in additional file 5: table s <dig>  we used publicly available and in-house developed tools, to compare expression profiles of all mirnas and the  <dig> validated mrnas , and predicted target pairs to score and identify high confidence mirna targets. thereby, eight mirnas  were identified for which regulated mrna targets were found with high confidence. subsequently, the expression levels of selected mirnas were analyzed by qpcr. in these experiments, data obtained by the mirna array for mir-15a, mir-20a, mir-20b, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> were confirmed ; whereas mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were also regulated in uvb-treated cells in accordance with the mirna array results, the observed differences did not reach statistical significance . expression levels for mir-15a, mir-20a, mir-20b, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  along with their established target mrnas.

mirna-mrna regulatory networks in uvb-induced senescence
high confidence targets were identified for mir-20a and mir-20b encoded by the mir-17- <dig> cluster which is known to synergize with myc in cancer development  <cit> , probably through repression of p21waf <dig> expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . however, there is also evidence that mir-17- <dig> blocks e2f-dependent steps in the regulation of angiogenesis  <cit> . our analysis confirmed a high confidence interaction between both mir-20a and mir-20b with p21waf <dig> , p15ink4b , runx <dig>  and vegf-a , thereby validating the analytical procedure. e2f <dig> and cyclin d <dig> are predicted targets for both mir-20a and mir-20b. whereas decreased expression of mir-20a/b was not correlated with altered mrna levels of e2f <dig> and cyclin d <dig> , upregulation of cyclin d <dig> gene expression during uvb-induced senescence was observed at the protein level . results of the bioinformatic analysis suggested several so far unreported potential targets for mir-20a and mir-20b in the context of uvb-induced senescence. thus, dram, ids, nfat <dig>  egr <dig>  ccnd <dig>  and rarb were identified as potential high confidence interactions for both mir-20a and mir-20b . in addition, the data suggest timp <dig>  etv <dig>  b2m, igfbp- <dig>  and rras <dig> as potential targets for mir-20a , and tgm <dig>  cpe, rhoj, and serping <dig> as potential targets for mir-20b .

mir- <dig> is known to inhibit angiogenesis by suppressing vegf release  <cit> , and contributes to silencing of p21waf <dig> gene expression after dna damage  <cit> . moreover, mir- <dig> increases survival in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, by directly targeting pten and upregulation of the akt signaling pathway  <cit> . our analysis in uvb-induced senescence confirmed a high confidence interaction of mir- <dig> with cdkn1a and vegf-a , thereby validating the analytical procedure. results of the bioinformatic analysis suggested dram, pik3ip <dig>  dkk <dig>  serpin g <dig>  adamts <dig>  timp <dig>  btg <dig>  runx <dig> and egr <dig> as potential targets for mir- <dig> .

mir-15a, along with mir- <dig>  is commonly deleted in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia  <cit>  and known to target multiple oncogenes, including bcl <dig>  mcl <dig>  ccnd <dig>  and wnt3a  <cit> . our analysis confirmed a high confidence interaction between mir-15a and vegf-a in uvb-induced senescence , thereby validating the analytical procedure. results of the bioinformatic analysis suggested pappa, apod, rras <dig>  runx <dig>  rarb, btg <dig>  notch <dig> and sfrp <dig> as potential targets for mir- <dig> .

mir- <dig> is known to suppress expression of the histone methyltransferase ezh <dig>  <cit> . our analysis confirmed a high confidence interaction between mir- <dig> and ezh <dig> in uvb-induced senescence , thereby validating the analytical procedure. accordingly, ezh <dig> expression was significantly downregulated at both mrna and protein level in uvb treated cells . results of the bioinformatic analysis suggested birc <dig>  nat <dig>  and cxcl <dig> as potential targets for mir- <dig>  . whereas the majority of analyzed potential mrna targets for mir- <dig> displayed a positive correlation with mir- <dig> levels , the biological meaning of these interactions remains to be established.

to further validate the bioinformatics-based target selection, regulation of several newly identified candidate genes by specific micrornas was addressed in hdf overexpressing mir-15a, mir-20a, and mir- <dig>  respectively. in all cases, microrna levels were significantly  increased by transfection . for the genes rarb, runx <dig> and cdkn2b, we found that overexpression of the appropriate microrna species  reduced protein levels of the respective gene products . whereas these findings do not prove binding of micrornas 15a and 20a to the 3'-utr of the target genes, downregulation of protein expression by overexpression of selected mirnas provides a functional validation of the bioinformatics approach. the mrnas for several other genes, including vegfa, rhoj, and notch <dig> were significantly down-regulated by the appropriate micrornas ; however, the limited availability of high-quality antibodies precluded determination of protein expression levels in these cases.

a role of mir-101/ezh <dig> in uvb-induced senescence?
to address the functionality of the mir-101-ezh <dig> interaction in uvb-induced senescence of hdf and their importance for uvb-induced senescence, we addressed the potential of these molecules to affect cellular senescence in hdf. in a first set of experiments, we analyzed consequences of overexpression of mir- <dig>  using reverse transfection, mir- <dig> was overexpressed in human diploid fibroblasts, which resulted in a clear upregulation of mir- <dig> . the strong upregulation of mir- <dig> induced a significant downregulation in the level of ezh <dig> mrna  and protein . in consequence, overexpression of mir- <dig> was sufficient to reduce the rate of proliferation of human diploid fibroblasts  and induced a significant increase in the number of sa-β-gal positive cells . these experiments suggest that indeed mir- <dig> has the potential to downregulate ezh <dig> mrna and protein levels in hdf, and this can lead to growth arrest and entry into premature senescence. to knock down ezh <dig> expression in hdf, lentiviral vectors carrying ezh2-targeting shrnas were used. out of five shrnas tested, # <dig> and # <dig> effected a significant downregulation of ezh <dig> levels in transfected cells . lentiviral vectors were prepared carrying these shrnas and used to infect hdf. ezh <dig> knockdown led to a downregulation of cell proliferation, along with a significant increase in the percentage of sa-β-gal positive cells, suggesting that knocking down ezh <dig> can induce premature senescence of hdf .

to address the role of mir- <dig> in uvb-induced cellular senescence, we attempted to experimentally reduce mir- <dig> levels by transfection of mir- <dig> inhibitory rnas. this treatment was started one day before uvb treatment and continued thereafter, in order to keep mir- <dig> levels constantly low. using reverse transfection, the levels of mir- <dig> were significantly reduced in control hdf  and mir- <dig> knockdown efficiently abrogated mir- <dig> upregulation in uvb-treated fibroblasts . however, ezh <dig> mrna was not significantly upregulated in mir- <dig> depleted cells, irrespective of uvb treatment ; and mir- <dig> knockdown failed to increase ezh <dig> protein levels in both cases . to address potential mechanisms underlying the failure to upregulate ezh <dig>  ezh <dig> was also overexpressed by lentiviral vectors. both in hdf and in easy-to-transfect human osteosarcoma  cells, overexpression of ezh <dig> mrna was transient and no elevation of ezh <dig> protein levels was observed in hdf , for reasons that remain to be established. together, these experiments indicate that reduction of mir- <dig> was not sufficient to rescue ezh <dig> expression in uvb-treated cells. accordingly, the phenotype of uvb-induced cellular senescence was not significantly affected by preventing the uvb-induced upregulation of mir- <dig> . consistent with this observation, knockdown of mir- <dig> also failed to significantly reduce the percentage of sa-β-gal positive cells after uvb treatment .

discussion
in this communication, we addressed molecular mechanisms underlying uvb-induced senescence of human diploid fibroblasts. using genome-wide transcriptome analysis, we identified a transcriptional signature of uvb-induced senescence. in parallel, a comprehensive screen for micrornas regulated during uvb-induced senescence was performed and five micrornas were identified that are significantly regulated during the process. subsequent analysis revealed several well established mirna-mrna regulatory interactions including mir-101/ezh <dig>  thereby validating the assay. in addition, several new mirna-mrna regulatory interactions were identified to occur in uvb-induced senescence. overexpression of mir- <dig> and downregulation of ezh <dig> independently induced senescence in the absence of uvb irradiation. however, the downregulation of mir- <dig> was not sufficient to block the phenotype of uvb-induced senescence, suggesting that other uvb-induced processes contribute to the senescence response, partially redundant with upregulation of mir- <dig>  these findings extend our knowledge of mir-mrna regulatory interactions, and at the same time provide a rich resource for data mining to identify new players in uvb-induced senescence and potential targets for interventions in extrinsic skin aging.

transcriptional profiling of uvb-induced premature senescence
whereas a low-density dna array was used previously to study changes in the level of  <dig> senescence-related genes in uvb-induced senescence of hdf  <cit> , the current study provides the first genome-wide transcriptional analysis of uvb-induced senescence. as could be expected  <cit> , activation of p <dig> signaling and suppression of the g1/s transition were observed along with a pronounced dna damage response, as revealed by pathway analysis tools. we also observed concerted regulation of genes in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling and hepatic fibrosis/heaptic stellate activation pathways, which conceivably reflect specific responses to uvb irradiation, used here to trigger the senescence response. of note, there were also distinct changes in the regulation of genes coding for enzymes in the pyrimidine and nicotinamide metabolism; however, more work will be required to fully understand the implications of these alterations for uvb-induced senescence. conceivably, the transcriptional signature of uvb-induced senescence, as shown here, will pinpoint new targets for intervention in extrinsic photoaging, which will be investigated in follow-up studies.

mirna-mrna regulatory networks in uvb-induced senescence
mir- <dig>  a known transcriptional target of p <dig>  <cit> , was strongly upregulated at day  <dig>  as expected from the observed activation of p <dig>  similarly, downregulation of mir-20a and mir-20b is consistent with previous observations suggesting that members of the mir-17- <dig> cluster are commonly downregulated in various senescence models as well as in organismal aging  <cit> . these observations validated the mirna screening approach. it is known that mirnas regulate both stability and translation of mrnas, and in most cases upregulation of mirnas leads to the inhibition of gene function  <cit> . the mir-17- <dig> cluster, containing the microrna-17-18-19-20- <dig> polycistron, cooperates with myc in tumorigenesis  <cit> , probably by silencing of p21waf <dig> expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . on the other hand, mir-17- <dig> inhibited proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic carcinoma cells  <cit> , blocked e2f-dependent steps in the regulation of angiogenesis  <cit> , and repressed endothelial cell migration  <cit> , suggesting cell type specific effects. our finding that e2f <dig> and vegfa are relevant targets for mir-20a/b in the context of uvb-induced senescence is consistent with these data.

although frequently overexpressed in human malignancies, mir- <dig> may actually function as a tumor suppressor gene. accordingly, mir- <dig> abrogated vegf protein secretion, suggesting that mir- <dig> interferes with angiogenesis  <cit> , blocked tumor development in mammary fat pads  <cit> , and suppressed proliferation of human colon cancer stem cells  <cit> . however, mir- <dig> was also shown to i) promote tumor growth and angiogenesis by targeting integrin-β <dig>  <cit> , ii) to contribute to silencing of p21waf <dig> gene expression after dna damage  <cit> , and iii) to promote cell proliferation and clonogenicity of hepg <dig> cells  <cit> , suggesting that effects of mir- <dig> depend on cellular context. upregulation of p21waf <dig> gene expression in uvb-treated cells was correlated with the downregulation of mirnas 20a/b and  <dig>  known to target p21waf <dig> <cit> , and the identification of e2f <dig> and vegfa as relevant targets for mir- <dig> in the context of uvb-induced senescence is consistent with the available data.

mir-15a, along with mir- <dig>  was the first microrna linked to cancer because both genes are commonly deleted in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> . expression of mirnas encoded by the mir-15/ <dig> cluster inhibits cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis of cancer cells, and suppresses tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. mir-15a and mir-16- <dig> function by targeting multiple oncogenes, including bcl <dig>  mcl <dig>  ccnd <dig>  and wnt3a  <cit> . in contrast to their function as tumor suppressors, mir- <dig> can also promote tumor growth and progression, when expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts  <cit> . the identification of vegfa as relevant target for mir- <dig> in the context of uvb-induced senescence is consistent with these data. on the other hand, mrna levels of e2f <dig> and bcl <dig> were downregulated in uvb-treated cells , although three mirnas known to target e2f <dig>  and one mirna known to target bcl <dig>  were all significantly downregulated in uvb-treated cells . it is conceivable that, in these cases, additional regulatory processes take place, which remain to be identified. a particular complication in the interpretation of the current results lies in pleiotropic effects of uvb irradiation, which are known to affect the expression of selected mirnas and mrnas  but also may influence protein translation  <cit>  and/or protein stability  <cit> . accordingly, the assignment of mirnas and gene expression changes reflects plausibility rather than a strict mechanistic dependence. bioinformatics analysis and preliminary validation analysis performed in the current study highlighted several mirna targets as potential modulators of uvb-induced fibroblast senescence that were not previously described, including the cdk inhibitor cdkn2b and the transcription factors runx <dig> and rarb. whereas these findings establish cdkn2b, runx <dig> and rarb as functional target genes for mir-15a and mir-20a, respectively, the binding of these micrornas to the 3'-utr of the target genes remains to be confirmed by additional experiments.

regulation of uvb-induced senescence: the role of mir- <dig> and ezh2
the here reported data demonstrate for the first time the implication of mir-101/ezh <dig> signaling in uvb-induced senescence of human dermal fibroblasts. in control experiments, upregulation of mir- <dig> and the concomitant downregulation of ezh <dig> was also observed in two independent hdf strains, hff- <dig> and pff , indicating that the regulation of these components is a conserved feature in the senescence response of human dermal fibroblasts to uvb irradiation. the inverse relationship between mir- <dig> and ezh <dig> expression levels was noticed before  <cit>  and ezh <dig> has been shown by others to play a role in cellular senescence  <cit> . when this communication was under revision, it was reported by others that mir- <dig> controlled ezh <dig> function in cellular senescence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> . in the present communication, functional interactions between mir- <dig> and ezh <dig> in uvb-induced senescence of hdf were analyzed in more detail. for example, we tried by knockdown of mir- <dig> to rescue the expression levels of ezh <dig> in uvb irradiated cells. although knockdown of mir- <dig> was very efficient also in uvb treated cells, no corresponding increase in the level of ezh <dig> mrna or protein was observed, suggesting that expression of the ezh <dig> gene is regulated by additional signals, which remain to be established. it is conceivable that p <dig> is responsible for the effect, since p <dig> was shown to suppress the ezh <dig> gene promoter  <cit> . conversely, we also tried to rescue the phenotype of uvb-induced senescence by overexpression of ezh <dig> from a lentiviral overexpression vector. whereas ezh <dig> mrna was significantly upregulated in infected cells, this did not lead to any detectable increase of ezh <dig> protein levels, suggesting that overexpression of ezh <dig> protein is not well tolerated, at least in hdf. the mechanisms underlying downregulation of ezh <dig> in this cell type remain to be understood. after uvb irradiation, ezh <dig> protein levels were rapidly reduced, even prior to the induction of mir- <dig> , strongly suggesting that several different uvb-dependent pathways converge to downregulate ezh <dig>  the upregulation of mir- <dig> being just one of several triggers for this process.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here a comprehensive screen for micrornas and mrnas regulated during uvb-induced senescence in human diploid fibroblasts. using advanced bioinformatics solutions, we identified a network of mirna-mrna interactions mediating uvb-induced senescence in this cell type, providing a rich resource for future data mining. the data reported in this communication illustrate the regulation of five distinct mirnas during uvb-induced cellular senescence. together the results obtained in this study suggest important roles for micrornas mir- <dig>  mir-20a/b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  and their mrna targets, during uvb-induced senescence of human diploid fibroblasts.
