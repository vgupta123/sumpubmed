BACKGROUND
the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies over the past decade has led to a flood of both de-novo sequencing and re-sequencing projects in almost every branch of the tree of life. within the fungal kingdom, comparative genome studies have led to the unexpected finding that large genomic regions may be variable among isolates of a given species. one category of these variable regions are unique chromosomes referred to as supernumerary or conditionally dispensable because they are not typically required for saprophytic growth  <cit> . these chromosomes have been identified in many fungi including magnaporthe oryzae  <cit> , fusarium oxysporum  <cit> , nectria haematococca  <cit> , mycosphaerella graminicola  <cit> , cochliobolus heterostrophus  <cit> , leptosphaeria maculans  <cit> , and alternaria alternata  <cit> .

plant pathogenic fungi in the genus alternaria  infect a remarkable range of host plants and are major causes of agricultural yield losses  <cit> . conditionally dispensable chromosomes  are carried by several of the small-spored, plant-pathogenic alternaria  species  <cit> . these chromosomes are generally less than  <dig> mb in size, and may be transmitted horizontally between isolates in a population, potentially conferring new pathogenic attributes to the receiving isolate  <cit> . loss of the cdc can also occur during repeated sub-culturing, resulting in the transition from a pathogenic to saprophytic form of the fungus  <cit> . several genes coding host specific toxins  have been located to gene clusters on cdcs, including those producing af-toxin from the strawberry pathotype  <cit> , ak-toxin from the japanese pear pathotype  <cit> , and act-toxin from the tangerine pathotype  <cit> . these toxins share a common  <dig> -epoxy-8-hydroxy-9-methyl-decatrienoic acid structural moiety, with the genes encoding each toxin sharing a high degree of homology  <cit> . in addition, the amt gene from the apple pathotype, a gene involved in host-specific am-toxin cyclic peptide biosynthesis, is located on a small chromosome of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  <cit> , with at least four copies involved in am-toxin biosynthesis  <cit> . the only other gene sequences identified to date on cdcs are extended families of transposon-like sequences   <cit> .

horizontal gene transfer  is the movement, without recombination, of stable genetic material between two individuals  <cit> . hgt may not only occur between different individuals of the same species, but also between species or even between bacteria and fungi or between fungi and oomycetes  <cit> . in fungi, the movement of plasmids, mycoviruses, transposable elements, gene clusters, and whole chromosomes have been demonstrated from one individual to another  <cit> . the first theory to explain gain and loss of hsts was proposed in  <dig>  <cit> . it has then been hypothesized that the genome content of cdcs in alternaria species were acquired through hgt events  <cit> . the most well studied example of hgt in fungi is the movement of the toxa gene from the wheat blotch pathogen stagonospora nodorum to pyrenophora tritici-repentis, the causal agent of tan spot of wheat  <cit> . this horizontal transfer event was identified by nucleotide sequence similarity and structural comparisons between genes from both species. the direction of transfer was inferred by the fact that the toxa gene consisted of a single haplotype in p. tritici-repentis but  <dig> haplotypes in s. nodorum isolates.

alternaria arborescens , the fungus that produces host-specific aal toxin, is the causal agent of stem canker of tomato  <cit> . it has been observed in pulsed field gel electrophoresis  studies that a. arborescens carries one cdc of  <dig> -mb  <cit> . to date, only two genes have been reported to be carried on this cdc including alt <dig>  which is a pks gene involved in aal toxin biosynthesis  <cit> , and aamsas, also a pks gene  <cit> . a cdc deletion mutant of a. arborescens generated through restriction enzyme mediated integration  showed a toxin and pathogenicity minus phenotype  <cit> . in addition, in protoplast fusion experiments, a cdc from a. arborescens was observed to transfer into the strawberry pathotype, and subsequently introduced new tomato pathogenicity to the fusant  <cit> .

in this study, we used a next generation sequencing approach to produce a draft sequence of the a. arborescens genome and used a novel bioinformatics approach to separate cdc contigs from the essential chromosome  contigs. the gene content of the cdc was analyzed to answer the following questions:  what is the difference between the cdc and ec genome content at the nucleotide level?  are cdc genes under positive selection and could they represent additional virulence factors in addition to the known toxin encoding genes?  is the evolutionary history of the cdc the same as that of the ecs, and is there any evidence of a hgt event? in answering these questions, we confirmed a different genome content pattern of the a. arborescens cdc and found evidence for hgt.

RESULTS
sequencing & assembly
a. arborescens strain egs 39– <dig>   <cit>  was sequenced by a whole genome shotgun approach using the illumina genome analyzer ii, which resulted in ~ <dig> million paired-end short reads of  <dig> bp representing 90x average coverage of the predicted genome content. de-novo assembly was performed using velvet  <cit>  , and confirmed by edena  <cit>  and minimus <dig>  <cit> . the assembly resulted in  <dig>  contigs with a n <dig> of 624kb and total size of  <dig> mb  one hundred thirty-seven large contigs with lengths greater than 10kb and representing 98% of the genome assembly content were chosen for further analysis.

marker-assisted identification of contigs carrying toxin biosynthetic genes
the first challenge in analyzing the cdc was to isolate its assembly contigs away from ec contigs. for this genome, the process was made more challenging as there is no defined reference genome, few genetic markers, and no optical map. it is known from previous studies that most alternaria species, including the isolate used in this study, have a single cdc  <cit> . to begin assembly of the this chromosome, two previously identified cdc genes that belong to the toxin biosynthetic cluster, alt <dig>  and aamsas  <cit> , were used as markers to search in all contigs. through this strategy, two putative cdc contigs of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb in length were identified as containing alt <dig> and aamsas, respectively. these two contigs were annotated to identify pks genes, other toxin biosynthetic genes, as well as genes with orthologs in other fungi and bacteria . multiple putative hst genes were identified on both contigs, consistent with predictions based on previous reports  <cit> .

identification of the remaining cdc contigs and validation by southern hybridization
to identify additional cdc contigs, the alternaria brassicicola  genome sequence was used as a reference . a. brassicicola is a related species to a. arborescens  but does not carry cdcs. all contigs from aa were aligned to ab contigs using mummer  <cit>  as the alignment tool with an identity cut-off at 90%. eight previously identified marker genes from aa,  <dig> from the ec and  <dig> from cdc, were used to set criteria to distinguish contigs belonging to cdcs versus ecs  <cit> .  after comparing the alignments of contigs containing the  <dig> marker genes, we set a cdc contig cut-off as those contigs with less than 20% coverage of sequence aligned to ab with higher than 90% identity . through this method,  <dig> predicted cdc contigs were identified with total length of  <dig> mb, the same as the expected size from clamped homogenous electric fields  gel analysis  <cit>  . the remaining  <dig> contigs were considered essential chromosomes  with total genome size of  <dig> mb . validation that the selected contigs belong to the cdc was performed by southern hybridization using genes predicted to reside on the cdc and ec contigs respectively as probes . five probes were hybridized including  <dig> from the cdc and  <dig> from the ec. each probe gene is predicted to be present in a single copy. the first probe was alt <dig>  a toxin gene known to reside on the cdc  <cit> . this was followed by hybridizing with three cdc genes predicted from the de-novo assembly, including a transporter cdc_ <dig>  a polysaccharide export protein cdc_ <dig>  and an o-methyltransferase cdc_ <dig>  the fifth probe was ec_97_90_g <dig>  a gene annotated as pks and predicted to reside on the ecs.

the first two contigs contain two cdc marker genes and the following six contigs contain six ec marker genes.

gene prediction, length, gc3-content, and repeat identification
nine thousand, one hundred sixty-seven genes were predicted by fgenesh  <cit>  using pre-trained alternaria parameters, of which  <dig> genes were assigned to cdc contigs and  <dig> to ec contigs. the average length of each predicted gene was  <dig>  kb, and the gene density was  <dig> kb per gene. compared to gene predictions for a. brassicicola , a. arborescens genes were longer and present in lower density. to evaluate the origin of the cdc, the predicted genes residing on the cdc and ec contigs were compared at the nucleotide level, including gene length, gc3-content  <cit> , repeat load, and codon usage bias. this analysis showed that cdc genes are about 200bp shorter on average than ec genes  and have significantly lower gc3-content . repeat regions composed  <dig> % of cdc contigs while only  <dig> % of ec contigs . it should be noted that some repeat regions could be lost in short read sequences de-novo assemblies, however, even with possible suppressed numbers, this result indicates approximately 10x repeat enrichment in the cdc compared to the ec.

codon usage analysis
codon usage comparisons of cdc and ec genes were used to determine whether a bias in codon usage exists between the two groups. both the codon adaptation index  <cit>   and relative synonymous codon usage   <cit>  correlation  from the two groups were significantly different, suggesting a different origin. the largest codon usage bias was observed for the amino acids tyrosine, lysine, and asparagine, with a preference for a over g and t over c in cdc genes . these three amino acids were not biased for cdcs in fusarium <cit> , indicating there's no universal cdc codon usage bias pattern between alternaria and  fusarium.

annotation of ec genes
the assembly results showed the size of essential chromosomes region collectively to be  <dig>  mb with  <dig> predicted genes. repeatmasker identied only  <dig> % of the ec region as simple repeats  and  <dig> % as low complexity, indicating that short repeats may be lost during de novo assembly of illumina sequencing reads. for secreted protein identification,  <dig>  of the ec proteins were predicted to contain signal peptides, and were functionally annotated using blast to the ncbi database with more than 98% of the genes returning at least one hit with an e-value <  <dig> e- <dig>  from the blast results, we identified  <dig> transcription factors,  <dig> oxidase proteins,  <dig> kinase proteins,  <dig> transporters,  <dig> cytochrome p450s, and  <dig> different proteases.

annotation of cdc genes
several host-specific toxin genes and transposon-like sequences have been reported to be carried by cdcs in alternaria  <cit> . we used two methods to annotate the functions of resident cdc genes:  they were blasted against the ncbi non-redundant database as well as pfam  <cit>  and ncbi cdd  <cit>  to search for functional domains;  they were scanned to identify transcription factors, pks genes, nrps genes, p450s, transporters, and pathogenicity related genes.

from  <dig> ncbi blastn hits of putative cdc genes , the top five species matches were pyrenophora teres, pyrenophora tritici-repentis, phaeosphaeria nodorum, leptosphaeria maculans, and nectria haematococca, all of which are fungal phytopathogens. interestingly, a. alternata was ranked 7th in this list, demonstrating that cdc genes were more similar to genes present in other fungal species rather than other alternaria spp. moreover, besides n. haematococca, all these other fungi are closely related taxonomically belonging to the class, dothideomycetes.

gene ontology terms were assigned to cdc genes based on blast matches with sequences whose function was previously characterized  <cit> . ninety cdc genes were assigned to a biological process,  <dig> for molecular function, and  <dig> for cellular component . among the biological process assignments, 54% of genes were assigned to “metabolic process”, and 10% to “biosynthetic process”. enrichment of metabolic and biosynthetic process in cdc genes as compared to ec genes supported the observation that alternaria cdc genes were enriched for polyketide synthases  and toxin synthases. molecular function terms showed a significant percentage  to “nucleotide/nucleic acid binding”, which showed an enrichment of transcription factors and gene regulation elements.

to provide a more detailed characterization of putative cdc genes, each was translated to identify protein families. among the  <dig> predicted cdc proteins,  <dig> were identified as carrying pks domains. two proteins were found to carry highly modular domains: ks-at-kr-acp on cdc_ <dig> and ks-at-dh-er-kr-acp on cdc_ <dig>  the remaining  <dig> pks proteins each carried  <dig> or  <dig> acps  domains. seven proteins were found to carry nrps domains:  <dig> enterobactin domains,  <dig> bacitrancin domains,  <dig> pyochelin domain, and  <dig> cda <dig> domain. two proteins were identified as hybrid pks-nrps. seven proteins were identified as p <dig> monooxygenase proteins. for transcription factors,  <dig> proteins were characterized to contain tf domains, in which zn2cys <dig> was the prominent group. multiple adp/atp transporters, abc transporters, ion transporters and major facilitator superfamily  transporters were also found in cdc protein group. additionally, it was found that multiple proteins carrying fad binding domains and oxidoreductases. finally,  <dig> proteins were identified as putative pathogenicity related genes through scanning cdc genes in the pathogen-host interactions database   <cit>  . see additional file  <dig> for a complete cdc gene annotation list.

secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters
in fungi, it has been reported that genes responsible for secondary metabolite biosynthesis  may be clustered  <cit> . typically these include pks or nrps genes, as well as genes responsible for structural modifications of initial metabolites, for transport, and for transcription regulation  <cit> . in this study, we screened each cdc gene and those surrounding them, looking for evidence of clustering of pks, nrps, transcription factors, transporters, p <dig> proteins, fad binding proteins, transferases, and oxidoreductases. we identified  <dig> putative smb clusters . a typical smb cluster is formed by 3– <dig> genes, with  <dig> or  <dig> pks or nrps genes, and other metabolite syntheses related genes.

evolutionary selection of cdc genes and domains
to estimate selection on cdc and ec genes, ka/ks ratios were calculated, with the assumption that genes with ka > ks were likely under positive selection, genes with ka = ks were likely evolving neutrally, and genes with ka < ks were likely under purifying  selection. twenty-eight cdc and  <dig>  ec genes were successfully aligned to a. brassicicola genes and ka and ks values were calculated for each. it was observed cdc genes had about a double ka  and larger ka/ks ratios  than ec genes , possibly indicating greater positive selection on cdc genes. the two cdc genes with highest ka/ks ratio was cdc_ <dig>  and cdc_ <dig> . however, no cdc genes showed ka/ks >  <dig>  suggesting that in these two alternaria species strong positive selection may only occur in specific regions of a protein. the selection ratio only at conserved domains of cdc genes was then estimated. domains of aligned cdc genes were identified using the ncbi cdd database. each individual domain was extracted then the ka/ks ratio was calculated and compared to that from same full length protein . we found two domains from cdc_ <dig> with a higher ka/ks ratio compared to whole length protein: a 12x increase for the haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolases  domain, which uses a nucleophilic aspartate in their phosphoryl transfer reaction, and 2x increase for heavy-metal-associated  domain, which transports or detoxifies heavy metals. another interesting example was cdc_ <dig>  whose domain patatin-like phospholipase  showed a  <dig> x increase compared to whole length protein.

origin of cdc
in the taxonomy report of cdc blast results, top hits came primarily from closely related dothideomycete fungi, indicating cdc may have fungal origin, or a transfer event occurred between cdc content and one or more fungal genomes. to test whether cdcs have the same phylogenetic placement with ecs, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted, including ec and cdc genes from a. arborescens, genes from a. brassicicola, and from three other ascomycete species: p. tritici-repentisl. maculans, and a. oryzae. proteins coded by  <dig> genes showing homology in all  <dig> groups were used to build a distance tree  using the neighbor-joining method  <cit> . results show the cdc clade was within but basal to the two alternaria clades.

a blast score ratio   <cit>  analysis was performed to test whether individual proteins on the a. arborescens cdc had more similarity to a. brassicicola or other fungi, and the result was compared with the same analysis to ec proteins. complete genome protein sequences of three fungal species: p. tritici-repentisl. maculans, and a. oryzae were extracted and built into a library called “3-fungi”, representing proteins from closely related fungal species. then proteins from the cdc and ecs were compared to the a. brassicicola protein library and “3-fungi” protein library respectively . it was clear, that there was less divergence between ec proteins and a. brassicicola proteins compared to that with other fungi , consistent with the species phylogeny. in contrast, cdc proteins were more similar to proteins from other fungi , suggesting they have different evolutionary history other than ec proteins.

discussion
comparison to other cdc containing fungi
compared to other recently published assemblies of cdcs in filamentous fungi, a. arborescens has a relatively small number of cdcs  and the size  is small. m. graminicola  was reported to have the highest number of dispensable chromosomes with upwards of  <dig> ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig> mb  <cit> . three cdcs in n. haematococca  <cit> , and  <dig> complete cdcs and partial region of another  <dig> in f. oxysporum <cit>  were identified. in other alternaria  species, identified cdcs are relatively larger such as  <dig> mb in the strawberry pathotype  <cit> ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  in the apple pathotype  <cit> , and  <dig>  mb in the japanese pear pathotype  <cit> . in a. arborescens, only  <dig> dispensable chromosome is present, representing only 3% of the genome content, which is significantly smaller than other cases and may suggest a more recent acquisition or different origin.

pks and nrps clusters
phytopathogenic fungi produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites, including host-selective toxins conferring pathogenicity  <cit> . it was reported in two basidiomycete maize pathogens candidate effector genes were located in small clusters that were dispersed throughout  the genome  <cit> . however, in some other fungi, especially ascomycetes, genes coding for toxins can co-locate in clusters consisting of more than  <dig> contiguous genes. a well-known example is the trichothecene biosynthetic gene cluster in f. graminearum which contains 10– <dig> genes including a terpene synthase gene, p <dig> monooxygenase genes, acyl transferase genes, regulatory genes, and transporter genes  <cit> . while in a. fumigatus,  <dig> smb clusters were identified, each containing 5– <dig> genes  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> pks,  <dig> nrps, and  <dig> hybrid pks-nrps genes were found on the cdc, with larger density compared to other fungi. however, among  <dig> predicted smb clusters, most were relatively small and only carried 3– <dig> genes, which may not represent the true cluster size due to short contigs length that may divide one large cluster into two or more. one example of an identified cluster was located on contig node_ <dig> which consists of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> pkss,  <dig> nrps putatively coding for enterobactin, a phosphate transferase gene, and a mfs transporter. it lacks regulators, p450s, and transporters compared to other typical clusters. however, this cluster locates at the edge of the contig. only  <dig> genes away from this cluster, another small cluster containing pks, nrps, p450s and an abc transporter was identified, suggesting these two could be part of a larger cluster . in this study, pks genes were identified by screening the pks sequence database, especially the domain database, which include: ketoacyl synthase , acyl transferase , ketoreductase , dehydratase , enoyl reductase , and acyl carrier protein . the ks, at, and acp domains are essential for pks genes  <cit> . two pks genes were identified to have multiple domains above: ks-at-kr-acp in cdc_ <dig>  and ks-at-dh-er-kr-acp in cdc_ <dig>  the remaining  <dig> pks genes each carries  <dig> or  <dig> acp domains. despite these conserved domains, other domains carried by these genes were divergent, indicating variance and multifunction of each pks genes . however, at least  <dig> domain families were found to be enriched in the indentified pks genes: abc_membrane , nadb_rossmann , and p-loop ntpase , suggesting these proteins are transmembrane and catalyzing enzymatic reactions. in the nrps and hybrid pks-nrps gene group, enterobactin, bacitracin, pyoverdine, syringomycin, and cda <dig> domains were identified,  <dig> of which were reported from to bacteria  <cit> . we eliminated the possibility of these genes originating from bacterial sequencing contamination by blast comparing all assembly contig sequences against the ncbi all bacterial database with  <dig> genome sequences, and found that the species with most hits was streptomyces coelicolor with > 80% identity. however, only  <dig> % of the entire s. coelicolor genome was covered. indicating that either these genes have an origin from bacteria or their product proteins interact with each other and require a highly conserved structure that was retained during evolution.

horizontal gene transfer
according to the horizontal gene transfer hypothesis, a. arborescens may have acquired its cdc from another alternaria species, from a fungus other than alternaria, or possibly from a bacterium or virus  <cit> . there are at least two other possible explanations for its origin:  cdcs were present in an alternaria ancestor, but were independently lost during vertical transmission in other non-pathogenic alternaria species.  cdcs arose from essential chromosome as a copy first but then went under divergence so no obvious orthology could be detected. to test which of the three models fits this case best, we built a complete ec protein library and blasted all cdc proteins against it to detect any possible orthology. out of  <dig> cdc proteins, we found  <dig>  showing orthology to ec proteins. although the low orthology percentage alone could not exclude the “duplication and divergence” model, taken together with differences on gc3-content and codon usage bias, the possibility that this model fits is minimal.

to distinguish between hgt and vertical transmission hypothesis, we identified differences between a. arborescens cdc and ec genes in length, gc3-content, and codon usage bias. there was limited orthology detected between two groups; cdc genes showed discordant phylogenetic relation with ec, and had higher similarity to other fungi than a. brassicicola. from previous phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> a. alternata isolates collected worldwide, cdc genes from different isolates were almost identical despite diverse ec background  <cit> . taken these results together, we concluded that the hgt model may serve as the best fit model in this case. additionally, these data support the theory proposed in  <dig> by nishimura that alternaria species acquired hsts by hgt  <cit> .

in this study, we identified evidence for the possibility of hgt event occurred in a. arborescens. for alternaria, this strategy has its advantages. first, as a pathogen with a wide host range, as observed in nature, transportable pathogenicity chromosome may increase pathogen's adaptation to environment. second, loss of a cdc when there's no host may reduce the cost of carrying extra genome content. third, as asexual fungi, horizontal transfer may compensate the lack of genetic recombination.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified a. arborescens cdc sequences through a whole genome sequencing and de-novo assembly process. by comparing nucleotide usage between cdc and ec contigs, we found evidence supporting hgt in a. arborescens. we also identified some predicted cdc genes under positive selection that may serve as virulence factors. however, questions still remain, such as the similarity and difference among cdcs from different a. arborescens isolates. to better understand cdc characteristics and mechanisms of hgt, other alternaria isolates need to be sequenced.

materials and methods
sequencing, assembly & alignment
a. arborescens dna was extracted following a protocol described  <cit>  and the sequencing library was prepared using the illumina paired-end dna sample prep kit. sequencing was performed using illumina genome analyzer ii. short reads were assembled de-novo using velvet, and assembly quality was improved by a pipeline including two alternate assemblers: edena  <cit> , and minimus <dig>  <cit> . parameters including k-mer length for velvet and hash length for edena were optimized by sequential step changes. the alignment between a.arborescens and a.brassicicola was conducted using the nucmer program in the mummer suite  <cit> , with parameter c =  <dig>  l =  <dig>  alignments with identities lower than 90% or lengths shorter than 100bp were removed.

southern hybridization

gene prediction, codon usage analysis & repetitive dna identification
gene prediction was conducted using fgenesh  <cit> , an ab initio gene predictor provided in the softberry website. a pre-trained alternaria matrix was used to optimize predictions. both cdss and protein sequences were generated and converted into fasta format files. acua  <cit>  was used for calculating cai and rsuc for each gene, and cai distribution curves from the cdc group and ec group were compared to each other. student’s f-test was used to test statistical significance. repeatscout  <cit>  was used for de-novo identification of repeat sequences in both cdc and ec sequences. the repeat libraries were then aligned back to cdc and ec contigs using nucmer to calculate the repeat percentage for each group.

gene annotation
blast2go  <cit>  was used to annotate genes by “blastx” to the ncbi non-redundant protein database and then go term assignment from the gene ontology database. annotation of conserved domains was identified by scanning proteins through pfam and ncbi cdd. pks and nrps genes were identified through scanning an online database sbspks  <cit> . the fungal transcription factor database   <cit>  was used to identify transcription factors. transporters, p450s, and oxidoreducatases were identified based on blast and domain inspection. potential secreted proteins were predicted using signal  <dig>   <cit> . pathogenicity and virulence factors were identified through scanning cdc genes in the pathogen-host interactions database   <cit> .

estimating ka/ks ratios
a. arborescens proteins were blasted against a. brassicicola proteins to generate a match list between the two groups with a bits score cut-off at  <dig>  the gene sequences coding for aligned proteins were extracted by an in-house perl script. prank  <cit>  was used to conduct codon alignment, in which two protein sequences were aligned first and then dna sequences were aligned based on the corresponding protein alignments. the codon alignment result was then entered into “codem” in paml  <cit>   for ka and ks calculation with model m <dig>  in calculating, the nei and gojobori  <cit>  method and yang and nielsen  <cit>  method were used.
