BACKGROUND
the biological species concept assumes that gene flow limits population differentiation and acts as a cohesive process for species  <cit> . related potential cohesive forces are selective sweeps of advantageous alleles, hybrid vigour involving immigrant alleles, and genetic rescue from frequent bouts of extinction and recolonization  <cit> . however, ehrlich and raven  <cit>  argued that gene flow itself is rarely sufficient to bind populations of a species together as a unit of concerted evolution even in the face of strong dispersal. instead of dispersal, natural selection is the primary force governing gene flow among populations. although ehrlich and raven  <cit>  recognized that selection may act as a cohesive force, they posited that in most cases selection keeps populations on independent evolutionary trajectories, and predicted that the increasing use of refined genetic tools would eventually reveal that gene flow is unimportant in unifying populations. similarly, in their monopolization hypothesis, de meester et al.  <cit>  concluded that many aquatic populations possess weak ongoing gene flow â€“ local adaptations, priority effects, and large egg/seed banks may restrict gene flow despite pronounced dispersal from nearby populations. thus, the disruptive selection and monopolization schools view the population as the primary unit of evolution whereas the cohesion school views the species as the primary unit of evolution.

despite the predictions by ehrlich and raven  <cit> , modern gene flow studies have strongly favoured the primacy of cohesive gene flow over disruptive local selection  <cit> . indeed, slatkin  <cit>  declared that he knows of no cases where molecular estimates of gene flow are low despite a high level of observed dispersal . moreover, nearly all of the low molecular estimates of gene flow in animals appear inflated by historical processes   <cit> . so, ehrlich & raven's key prediction of marked local population genetic differentiation in the face of dispersal appears unsupported. an additional blow against disruption/monopolization hypotheses is the recent theoretical and empirical evidence that the main role of selection may be as an enhancer  of gene flow via heterosis or universal selective sweeps  <cit> .

still, it is possible that the existing molecular estimates of gene flow, which are based largely on obligate sexual species, are unrepresentative of animals. de meester et al.  <cit> , for example, ranked cyclical parthenogens as the animal breeding system with the greatest potential for monopolization. cyclical parthenogens  have an increased capacity for rapid local adaptation over other breeding systems because of their frequent sexual reproduction followed by multiple generations of clonal selection  <cit>  and persistent priority effects  <cit> . there is now considerable evidence for the rapid evolution of population-specific adaptations in cladocerans such as body size, defensive structures, phototactic behavior, resistance to algal toxins, and parasite resistance <cit> . there is also growing direct evidence that these local adaptations arise in species with strong dispersal of propagules by avian vectors  <cit>  and wind  <cit> . colonization studies indicate that cyclical parthenogens such as daphniids appear to have strong dispersal capacity  <cit> . additional evidence for the strong natural dispersal capacity of cladocerans comes from paleogenetic analysis of cladoceran embryos in aged african lake sediments  <cit> . a single asexual hybrid clone of north american daphnia pulex appears to have been introduced into a central african lake and spread naturally throughout the continent in less than  <dig> years. likewise, clones in the daphnia pulex group appear to have dispersed naturally across immense distances in the arctic  <cit> . although nearly all cladocerans lack the potential heterotic advantage and asexual propagules of the d. pulex group, the examples do speak to the strong passive dispersal capacity of daphniids. thus, cladocerans appear to be biologically predisposed to the scenario envisioned by ehrlich and raven where local selection disrupts populations despite dispersal.

does the available indirect evidence then support low gene flow despite strong dispersal in cladocerans? there are many population genetic studies on cladocerans and most report moderate to strong population structure using relative estimates  <cit> . however, this result constitutes weak evidence for low gene flow because it is well known that founder effects and long-distance dispersal events  have been common in cladocerans  <cit> . additional evidence is necessary to tease apart ongoing gene flow from monopolization. analysis of population history offers one possible solution as the monopolization hypothesis and the ongoing gene flow hypothesis lead to different predictions about population genetic differentiation over time. under ongoing gene flow, population differentiation should decrease with time since founding  <cit> . moreover, gene flow and recombination should reduce allelic sequence divergence and the proportion of private alleles. but, with little or no ongoing gene flow, haplotype frequency differences, the proportion of private alleles, and allelic sequence divergences should increase among populations with time.

existing population history studies of daphnia do support the predictions of ongoing gene flow, but the generality of these results for the genus are uncertain. potentially older populations from large lakes show less genetic differentiation  than populations from presumed younger habitats such as small ponds  <cit> . however, the higher turnover rates in ponds compared to large lakes may lead to relatively high fst's in ponds  <cit> . a detailed 17-year longitudinal genetic study of two daphnia species with rock-pool subpopulations of known age showed a clear erosion of allozyme-based fst's with time  <cit> . still, the rock pools also appear to lack the large effective egg banks and strong spatial variation in biotic selection pressures  that are characteristic of cladoceran populations from larger water bodies. finally, a holarctic analysis of the daphnia tenebrosa s. l. using mtdna rflp's showed significant genetic structure among younger glaciated regions but no genetic structure among older non-glaciated regions. d. tenebrosa is a member of the d. pulex group that normally produces strictly asexually at higher latitudes, making it less susceptible to the proposed mechanisms of monopolization in sexual cladocerans  <cit> .

studies of sexual daphnia that use the absolute estimates of population divergences yielded by dna sequences are still uncommon . this absolute measure of population divergence will be sensitive to sampling error, but should be less inflated by founder effect. de gelas and de meester  <cit>  provided evidence from coi mtdna sequences that the present day population structure in european daphnia magna is largely the result of a mosaic formed by historical recolonization from four glacial refugia rather than from ongoing gene flow. they detected some divergent lineages in refugial areas but lacked samples for a detailed population analysis of refugial regions. in the present study we obtained both relative and absolute estimates of population genetic divergence; used both nuclear and mtdna genomic sequences; sampled populations from throughout the holarctic range of the study species ; and studied a sexual species of daphnia that commonly occupies permanent, weakly-disturbed waters with a large range of habitat ages.

the study species, daphnia rosea s.l. is a common component of oligotrophic permanent lakes and ponds in the boreal, alpine, and subarctic zones of the holarctic  <cit> . although habitat-specific head shapes are common in d. rosea, the most recent morphological treatments have supported one holarctic species  <cit> . allozyme and mtdna phylogenetic analyses of a few specimens from the extremes of the geographic range reported a western european clade  and a north american clade   <cit> , but provided no evidence for more than one species in each of these allopatric clades. d. rosea s.l. hatch from resting eggs in the spring and reproduce asexually for at least eight generations  <cit> . in the fall, some individuals produce sexual propagules that sink to the sediment and function as egg banks  <cit> , but vast numbers of resting propagules may float forming a surface scum and shoreline deposit  <cit> . the direct evidence for strong dispersal, potential regional genetic structuring, cyclical parthenogenetic breeding system, rapid local adaptations  <cit>  and frequent occupancy of permanent habitats suggests that d. rosea s.l. is a good candidate for testing the historical predictions of the monopolization hypothesis.

here, we tested the hypothesis that d. rosea s.l. conforms to the population structure of a sexual vagile species, where ongoing gene flow is sufficient to offset population genetic divergence. we aimed to compare populations from regions that are potentially of different ages by sampling in well-established glacial refugia  and in younger glaciated areas   <cit> . we also assessed the timescale and routes of recolonization of glaciated areas to understand if evolutionary significant dispersal limitation exists in d. rosea s.l. we found evidence for marked historical structure and little evidence for ongoing gene flow. populations from unglaciated regions exhibited significantly higher sequence divergences for nuclear and mitochondrial dna compared to populations from glaciated north america. we found the genetic signature of a single rapid population expansion for most of the glaciated new world, suggesting that dispersal limitation is insignificant on an evolutionary timescale. the results are consistent with the monopolization hypothesis where priority effects and selection trump contemporary gene flow, rendering the population or local metapopulation as the units of evolution.

RESULTS
we found marked regional structure of d. rosea s.l with three divergent allopatric mtdna clades: european; siberian and japanese-american and no indication of recent long-distance dispersal among regions  . the nd <dig> alignment was  <dig> bp with  <dig> unique ingroup haplotypes, no indels , and  <dig> variable sites. the best-fit ml model was tim + i + g . the ml distance between the european and siberian clades was  <dig> %, while the ml distances from the american-japanese clade to the european clade and the siberian clade were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. we suspected the existence of a pseudogene in two japanese populations  because of ambiguous sequences, and cloned pcr products to further examine the possibility. cloning of the pcr products revealed that each individual of the populations had two sets of haplotypes ; one with a complete reading frame and one with stop codons at 127â€“ <dig> bp. ambiguous sites and stop codons were absent from the mtdna of all individuals sampled outside of these two populations.

we found extremely high estimates of relative population structure within both glaciated and non-glaciated regions of the north american â€“ japanese mtdna clade; for non-beringian north america fst =  <dig>   and snn =  <dig>  ; for beringia fst =  <dig>   and snn =  <dig>   and for japan fst =  <dig>   and snn =  <dig>  . likewise, mtdna haplotype diversities were high for each region:  <dig>  Â±  <dig>   for non-beringian north america,  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  for beringia, and  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  for japan. private mtdna haplotypes  were common: 94% of the  <dig> north american haplotypes and 91% of  <dig> japanese haplotypes. population structure among local sites  was also extremely pronounced; fst =  <dig>  in western alaska, usa ; fst =  <dig>  in colorado, usa ; fst =  <dig>  in michigan, usa ; fst =  <dig>  in ontario, canada ; fst =  <dig>  in new york, usa ; fst =  <dig>  in central honshu, japan ; fst =  <dig>  in western hokkaido, japan  and fst =  <dig>  in eastern hokkaido, japan . for japan, amova revealed that  <dig> % of the variation in nd <dig> sequences occurred among regions,  <dig> % of the variation occurred among populations within a region and  <dig> % of the variation occurred within populations. although geographic distance among populations explained a significant amount of the variation in pairwise fst's in japan and in non-glaciated north america, the amount of variation explained was low .

unlike the universally high relative measures, absolute measures of population divergences populations from presumed older habitats  were generally greater than the divergences among populations from glaciated habitats  in mtdna and in ndna sequences . the nd <dig> alignment of the japanese-american clade contained  <dig> unique haplotypes , no indels, and  <dig> variable sites. the best-fit ml model was trn + g . average pairwise ml distances  among populations were much higher in japan  than in non-beringian north america  and beringian north america . mtdna nucleotide diversities were also greater in japan  than in non-beringia  and in beringia .

the hsp <dig> tree consisted of a subset of specimens represented on the nd <dig> tree of the japanese-american clade. the total alignment was total  <dig> bp with  <dig> variable sites and  <dig> unique alleles. two putative introns were detected: intron i  between  <dig> bp position and  <dig> bp position; and intron ii  between  <dig> bp position and  <dig> bp position. no indels were found in exons. 2â€“ <dig> bp and 3â€“ <dig> bp indels were found in intron i and intron ii, respectively. the best-fit ml model was gtr + i + g . average pairwise ml distances  among populations  were much higher in nonglaciated regions  than in non-glaciated north america .

north american populations showed genetic signatures of a bottleneck and postglacial expansion. most north american haplotypes were restricted to a star-like clade of closely related haplotypes  . the clade had significant negative values of neutrality tests . still, just two mitochondrial haplotypes were shared among populations in the star-like north american clade. one of these shared haplotypes formed the central haplotype in a haplotype network  and was widely distributed in north america: one population in alaska , one population in yukon , one population in wisconsin , three populations in michigan  and two populations in indiana . the other shared haplotype was detected only within a  <dig> km diameter region near the michigan â€“ indiana border. pairwise differences of all sequences  in the clade formed a unimodal distribution pattern, which fit the expected distributions of spatial expansion  and pure demographic expansion . the parameter tau in the spatial expansion model was  <dig>  . pairwise differences of the non-beringian sequences  in the clade formed a unimodal pattern, which fit the expected distributions of spatial expansion  but not of pure demographic expansion . the parameter tau in the spatial expansion model was  <dig>  .

similar to the mtdna, we detected a clade comprised of the non-beringian north american populations and two yukon populations with ndna  . the clade had significant negative values of neutrality tests . three nuclear haplotypes were detected as shared among populations in this north american clade. pairwise differences of all sequences  in the clade were distributed in a unimodal pattern, which is similar to the expected distributions under models of spatial and sudden expansions . the parameter tau in the spatial expansion model was  <dig> . however, the least-square fitting algorithm in arlequin  <cit>  did not converge, suggesting that the nuclear data poorly fit the available models. thus, the p-value for the available models and the 95% ci of the expected distributions were not available. similarly, pairwise differences of the non-beringian nuclear sequences  were distributed in a unimodal pattern, and the least-square fitting algorithm did not converge.

discussion
the phylogeographic and population genetic results are consistent with the monopolization hypothesis where gene flow is insufficient to prevent population divergence  <cit> . daphnia rosea s.l. may represent slatkin's  <cit>  missing gene flow category with strong estimated population structure despite strong dispersal abilities. morjan & rieseberg's  <cit>  review provides an indication of how extreme the population structuring is for d. rosea. they listed a mean fst in animals of  <dig>   for mtdna and  <dig>   for nuclear markers. a small percentage of studies  had a population subdivision estimate of >  <dig> . however, in each of these cases, the estimate was calculated across divergent geographic clades, suggesting that historical relationships inflated the estimate. our finding of fst >  <dig>  subdivision among populations within a regional clade and genetically divergent haplotypes among japanese populations reveals that the vagile d. rosea s.l. also possesses among the highest estimates of population subdivision yet recorded for animals.

unlike previous studies, and contrary to the predictions of ongoing gene flow, we found by two crude measures of habitat maturity that older populations possessed as much or more genetic structure than presumed younger populations. our results indicate that populations of daphnia from large lakes and large ponds can possess strong structure â€“ stronger than has been reported from small pond species  <cit> . part of the difference between our estimates and prior studies arises from the increased mutation rates of our markers. but this cannot be the only explanation as some studies of pond cladocerans  <cit>  have used rapidly evolving markers . nor is the pattern restricted to the present study species as ishida & taylor  <cit>  have recently found similarly strong population structure using the same markers in a large study of the lacustrine specialist, daphnia galeata. the absolute measures of genetic divergence from presumed older habitats or metapopulations in unglaciated areas  were generally much greater than those population genetic divergences among younger habitats . the contrast between glaciated and unglaciated areas was apparent in both the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes. only the beringian â€“ north american contrast for nd <dig> distances revealed similar levels of structure. analysis of more populations from central beringia is necessary to determine if the contrast is real. both the increased divergence with age of habitat and the very high proportion of private haplotypes found in most populations are inconsistent with ongoing gene flow acting to homogenize populations. however, they do satisfy a major prediction of the monopolization hypothesis: increased differentiation and divergence with population age.

the roles of local selection, ongoing gene flow with drift, and dispersal limitation are difficult to tease apart as contributors to the observed population structuring of d. rosea. ongoing gene flow with drift probably occurs, but it seems unlikely given the lack of allele sharing and relatively high sequence divergences among geographically close regions in japan with both ndna and mtdna . colonization studies  <cit> , the massive production of resting propagules, and the evidence for rapid postglacial colonization of vast areas of the northern hemisphere indicate that dispersal limitation may also be weak. the population genetic signature of d. rosea s.l. in north america is consistent with postglacial expansion from a beringian refugium. a severe genetic bottleneck in glaciated north america was clear from both the nuclear and the mitochondrial results. diverse nuclear lineages in the northern pacific coast  and reduced genetic diversity in glaciated regions indicates population expansion from beringia. the mitochondrial north american clade consistently showed the spatial expansion patterns in mismatch distributions with or without alaska and yukon populations. the spatial expansion model assumes that subdivided populations expand the distribution range and increase the total number of the individuals, while a pure demographic expansion model assumes that populations are not subdivided. the observed high value of fst and the high frequency of private haplotypes among the am <dig> populations  indicate subdivided populations. the star-like haplotype network  and the significant negative values of neutrality tests were also consistent with the expansion patterns of this clade. using tau = 2ut and assuming a divergence rate of  <dig> % per million years for arthropod mitochondrial protein-coding genes  <cit> , the expansion time is estimated to be  <dig>  <dig> years ago  for populations including alaska and yukon, and  <dig>  <dig> years ago  for populations excluding alaska and yukon. however, the relationship between the age and the evolutionary rate can be described by a vertically translated exponential decay curve, where the short-term  mutation rate gets exponentially higher, while the long-term  substitution rate is constant. the estimated expansion times could be overestimated more than  <dig> times because of the recent events   <cit> . thus, the spatial expansion of d. rosea s.l. in north america might have occurred rapidly after the last ice age . as both japan and alaska contain ample migratory waterfowl vectors, and our results provide evidence that much of the north american continent was rapidly colonized after glaciation, there are no reasons to believe that dispersal differences or limitations account for the differing divergence patterns between japan and north america. also, the refugial areas represent relatively small geographic areas  compared to the vast glaciated regions , so the divergence patterns are not attributable solely to isolation by distance.

of course, indirect estimates of gene flow apply only to the loci under study. selective sweeps of globally favourable alleles may occur at unsampled loci  <cit> . we note that the inclusion of mtdna in our study makes our conclusion of strong population differentiation conservative â€“ mtdna is perhaps one of the most susceptible loci to homogenizing selective sweeps in animals  <cit> . we also note that during the multiple generations of clonal reproduction in d. rosea, mtdna and nuclear genomes are linked, increasing the potential for background selection against immigrant genes  <cit> . our finding of generally concordant divergence patterns for nuclear and mitochondrial loci and the frequent observation of stable, lake-specific body shapes in d. rosea s.l.  <cit>  suggests that the strong population differentiation is not merely a locus-specific phenomenon.

if populations of daphnia rosea are indeed exposed to negligible gene flow despite dispersal, then what are the evolutionary consequences? speciation by habitat isolation or vicariance may occur if populations are separated in distant glacial refugia. most populations of d. rosea have likely gone extinct from the regular waves of catastrophic pleistocene glaciation or experienced turnover as local selection regimes changed. indeed, the shape of the mtdna tree for d. rosea is consistent with the recolonization of the holarctic from at least three geographically â€“ distant bottlenecked glacial refugia. our evidence that local regions continue to diverge over time  in vagile d. rosea, suggests that the evolutionary legacy of monopolization is perhaps the stabilization of countless innovations and adaptations in local metapopulations. some of these local adaptations such as parasite resistance  <cit>  and defensive structures on the head  <cit>  have already been identified for d. rosea.

although we present a case of marked population differentiation and sequence divergence in cladocerans, it is difficult to estimate how taxonomically widespread monopolization is. however, if a mixed breeding system and differing local selection regimes are important drivers of monopolization, then the patterns we found in d. rosea s.l. are perhaps more widespread among eukaryotes. more work is necessary to understand the causes of monopolization. future genetic analysis of preserved egg/embryo banks of cladocerans in lake sediments and permafrost may offer detailed window into the process.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings are consistent with negligible gene flow after founding, and the accumulation of genetic divergence with regional age. daphnia rosea s.l. showed increased levels of population divergence in mature unglaciated regions compared to presumed younger glaciated regions. previous direct evidence of vagility in d. rosea s. l. and our evidence for a rapid population expansion at the continental scale, suggests that most population differentiation is unlikely to be due to dispersal limitation. instead, priority effects and selection may play roles in limiting gene flow. the results challenge the notion that sexual populations of lacustrine cladocerans are generally unified by contemporary gene flow.
