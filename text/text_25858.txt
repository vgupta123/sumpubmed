BACKGROUND
the genus yersinia currently comprises three human pathogens , and at least  <dig> species considered harmless for humans, namely y. aldovae, y. bercovieri, y. frederiksenii, y. intermedia, y. kristensenii, y. mollaretii, y. rohdei, y. ruckeri  <cit> , y. aleksiciae  <cit> , y. similis  <cit> , y. massiliensis  <cit> , y. entomophaga  <cit> , y. nurmii  <cit>  and y. pekkanenii  <cit> . y. enterocolitica infection causes diarrhea, terminal ileitis, and mesenteric lymphadenitis, but not systemic infection, and often leads to secondary immunologically induced sequelae including erythema nodosum, reactive arthritis and reiter's syndrome  <cit> . the heterogenous species y. enterocolitica encompass six biotypes as differentiated upon biochemical tests  <cit> . biotype 1a strains are considered avirulent due to the lack of the yersinia virulence plasmid pyv  <cit> , whereas biotype 1b strains are highly pathogenic and lethal for mice. they form a geographically distinct group predominately isolated in north america and carry a high-pathogenicity island   <cit> . biotype 2- <dig> strains mainly found in europe and japan compose a weakly pathogenic group unable to kill mice  <cit> .

we have recently shown that strain w <dig>  confers lethality towards nematodes and manduca sexta larvae upon oral infection, and that this insecticidal activity is correlated with the presence of the so-called pathogenicity island tc-paiye  <cit> . this  <dig> kb-fragment is present in the biotype 2- <dig> strains, but absent in most biotype 1a and b strains, and carries the toxin complex  genes tcaa, tcab, tcac and tccc with homology to tc genes of photorhabdus luminescens. however, the absence of tc-paiye is not reflected by a loss of toxicity in case of subcutaneous infection, indicating the presence of yet unknown insecticidal determinants in y. enterocolitica  <cit> .

to investigate the genomic heterogeneity of the species y. enterocolitica, we have chosen to sequence the genome of the low-pathogenicity strain w <dig>  we report the annotation of this second genome sequence of a y. enterocolitica strain, and a detailed comparative genome analysis of the w <dig> genome with that of strain  <dig>  a representative of the highly pathogenic biotype 1b group. the data obtained provide novel insights into the biology, metabolism, adaptation strategies and evolutionary relationships of y. enterocolitica.

RESULTS
general features
the shotgun sequencing of the y. enterocolitica strain w <dig> genome revealed a total number of  <dig> reads with an average read length of  <dig>  assembly of  <dig> reads resulted in  <dig> contigs larger and  <dig> contigs shorter than  <dig>  base pairs  with a median level of coverage in contigs >  <dig> kb of  <dig>  ; one contig  exceeds this coverage level more than twice . the genome has an average g + c content of  <dig> % . upon pedant based annotation  <cit>  and search against a non-redundant protein database,  <dig> genes corresponding to a coding density of  <dig> % could be identified, but an unknown number of genes might have been missed due the short contigs not assembled . the analysis also revealed at least  <dig> trna genes. the fewer number of trna genes compared to finished yersinia genomes is probably due to collapsing of reads of the repeat sequences into fewer contigs  <cit> . the exact number of rrna operons could not be estimated from this draft assembly, as reads from identical copies probably assemble into the same contigs. the risk of frameshifts due to sequencing errors in longer homo-oligomers was reduced by the high coverage of the assembly. we have determined  <dig> pairs of consecutive orfs having best similarity to the same protein. however, this number also includes real pseudogenes not affected by any sequencing error.

genome comparison with strain 8081
y. enterocolitica  <dig> is one of three strains of this species whose sequences were available until february  <dig>  <cit> . it belongs to the biotype 1b group with higher pathogenicity potential to humans than the biotype 2- <dig> group. to delineate the most relevant features of the w <dig> genome, we decided to base our further analysis on a genome comparison between the shotgun sequence of strain w <dig> and the linear genome sequence of y. enterocolitica strain  <dig>  the alignment of both genomes using mauve  <cit>  shows long syntenic regions with few rearrangements and a general high sequence conservation, but also regions in both genomes that are not shared with the other . upon automatic and manual blast analysis, we revealed  <dig> genes present in the  <dig> genome but absent in that of w <dig>  and  <dig> genes that are specific for w <dig> with respect to strain  <dig>  the virulence plasmid pyv  <cit>  was not considered here. figure  <dig> shows the categories under which the w <dig> genes absent in  <dig> are summarized. besides hypothetical genes and those of unknown function, the largest numbers of gene-encoded factors fall into the functional groups transporter, metabolism and dna/rna processing. the latter group comprises  <dig> regulatory genes. the motility and phage sections are mainly composed of the ancestral flagellar locus flgii  and one specific prophage.

regions of difference
we then searched for regions of difference  between the genome sequences of  <dig> and w <dig>  by definition, those rod genes do not belong to the core genome of the two y. enterocolitica strains compared here, but might constitute additional metabolic or virulence-associated properties contributing to the overall strain fitness. twelve rod present in strain w <dig> are shown in figure 2a. while the average gc-content of the w <dig> genome sequence is  <dig> %, the rod on contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show an at least 2% higher or lower gc-content, suggesting their acquisition by lateral gene transfer   <cit> . phylogenetic tree analysis, however, revealed closely related genes of these contigs in other yersinia strains, with the exception of contig  <dig> that harbours phage related genes. the  <dig> genes flanking the rod might give additional information about the underlying recombination events. for example, a glycosyltransferase operon of  <dig>  might have been replaced by a related operon on contig  <dig>  that possibly contributes to o-antigen synthesis. a substitution of hypothetical genes by a non-homologous cluster of functionally unknown genes is observed in contig  <dig>  the rod on contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> obviously interrupt gene linearity with respect to the  <dig> genome, indicating that loss and substitution, or insertion, of genes might have taken place in these cases. contig  <dig> harbours several phage-related genes and is therefore assumed to represent a second prophage region. transposase genes were found in the  <dig> genome between ye <dig> and ye <dig>  a region covered by the lps synthesis in w <dig> , and a similar observation was made for the pts encoding cluster on contig  <dig>  more functional details on these rod are described below.

virulence genes or cluster present or absent in w <dig> compared with 8081
while ygi- <dig>  which is responsible for adhesion and includes a t4ss, is completely encoded on contig  <dig>  the high pathogenicity island  encoding yersiniabactin  <cit>  is missing in the genome of strain w <dig>  in contrast, we identified  <dig> functions probably involved in defence or virulence mechanisms present in w <dig>  but absent in  <dig> . two autotransporter or type v secretion proteins , one of them with homology to an aida-like adhesin, might play a role in  host-recognition by w <dig>  the insecticidal pathogenicity island tc-paiye is characteristic for biotype 2- <dig> strains, but absent in biotype 1a and 1b strains with the exception of wa <dig>   <cit> . another homology group of tc genes was found to be prevalent among clinical biotype 1a strains  <cit> . beside a second, non-clustered tccc <dig> locus  <cit> , no further factors with homology to toxin complex genes could be identified in w <dig> 

*absent in all yersinia species sequenced until 12/2010

Â§absent in y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis, but present in other yersinia species

to survive within its host organisms, y. enterocolitica needs to overcome both cellular  and peptide-mediated components. a candidate of the former group is the exported repeats-in-toxin rtxa, a cytolytic toxin of approximately  <dig> amino acids length encoded by contig  <dig>  it clusters with a putative rtx activating protein, rtxc, and a peptide chain release factor  <dig>  rtxh . among the yersiniae, only one y. enterocolitica serotype o: <dig> strain and y. kristensenii carry homologs of these proteins. the genome of w <dig> encodes three two-partner secretion  systems involved in hemolysin release, one of which is absent in the  <dig> genome. three peptidases of w <dig> might play a role in resistance towards antimicrobial peptides. w <dig> also produces an antibacterial protein or bacteriocin that is absent in  <dig>  the pyocin locus on contig  <dig> probably encodes killer proteins and a dual type immunity protein with domains similar to pyocin-e <dig> and colicin . its biological function, as well as that of a small toxic polypeptide , is yet unknown.

secretion/transfer systems and transporters
two distinct, chromosomally located type three secretion systems  mark one of the most striking differences between the two genomes. while ysa of  <dig> is absent in w <dig>  this strain harbours another t3ss, which we termed ysa <dig>  located on contigs  <dig> and  <dig> . pcr targeting the flanking regions resulted in a ~ <dig> bp fragment, justifying the link of both contigs. sequence analysis of ysa <dig> revealed a mosaic structure with a g/c content of  <dig> % between the flanking genes ye <dig> and ye <dig>  and a g/c content of  <dig> % between ye <dig> and ye <dig>  indicating two independent lgt events. the whole cluster is collinear to respective regions in apathogenic yersiniae such as y. frederikseni and y. intermedia. we found homologs of the plasmid-encoded t3ss of y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis, and partial collinearity, with respect to the left part of this  <dig> kb island. the right part carries yscc and yscd homologs, but no homologs of yopb, yopd or lcrv involved in translocon formation  <cit> . the functionality of ysa <dig> is unknown. of the two type  <dig> secretion system  cluster yst <dig> and yst <dig> in  <dig>  only yst <dig> responsible for a general secretion pathway  is present in strain w <dig>  contig  <dig> encodes factors involved in conjugal dna-transfer, namely trad, a moba/mobl protein, and a putative type iv prepilin that might contribute to lgt.

as iron is often a rate-limiting factor for pathogenic bacteria during infection, w <dig> requires iron-scavenging systems for survival in the host. beside the two iron and enterobactin transport systems within the pz, those comprise a hemophore cluster for heme binding and uptake , and a putative iron binding protein , the latter one absent in  <dig> 

we also identified eight abc transporters in w <dig>  two phosphotransferase systems , four permeases, two major facilitators, a sodium:bile acid symporter, and other transporters listed in table  <dig> or mentioned in the sections on metabolism and virulence. all of these are without counterparts in the genome of strain  <dig>  a glucitol/sorbitol-specific transporter  and a sorbose uptake system are also present in  <dig>  but not in y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis, and have homologs in all or most non-pathogenic species sequenced so far. a cellobiose uptake system was also identified . in total, our analysis identified a higher number of putative transporters with respect to strain  <dig> 

plasticity zone 
the plasticity zone of strain  <dig> ranges from ye <dig> to ye <dig> and has a total length of approximately  <dig> kb with  <dig> coding sequences . it was defined by thomson et al.  <cit>  as the largest region of species-specific genomic variation among y. enterocolitica biotypes, and it is absent from y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis. four contigs revealed to carry pz genes. we linked contigs 1088/ <dig> and 1803/ <dig> due to the presence of truncated hypf and fepg genes, respectively, at their ends. the primer combination 5'-gtttctttatgggcgcg-3'/5'-ttggcatggaggcctg-3' hybridizing to the ends of contigs  <dig> and  <dig> resulted in a pcr product of approximately  <dig> bp, thus allowing the linear reconstruction of the w22703-specific pz . with a total length of ~  <dig>  kb, it is significantly shorter than that of  <dig> and exhibits a comparably low density of virulence genes. many discrete functional units of the  <dig> pz are indeed missing in the w <dig> genome as confirmed by blast search of any pz-encoded protein against the translated shotgun sequence. the most prominent ones are  the pathogenicity island yapiye of  <dig> cds including a putative hemolysin, a toxin/antitoxin system ccda/ccdb, and a type iv pilus operon,  the t3ss ysa important for pathogenicity in an mouse oral infection model  <cit>  and  the t2ss yst <dig> required for full virulence  <cit> . further  <dig> pz genes absent in w <dig> are the two putative two component-systems  ye3561/ye <dig> and ye3578/ye <dig>  a chitinase , a putative lipase , a putative copper/silver efflux system , and the arsenic resistance operon. however, it is also worthy of note that pz loci assumed or known to play a role in pathogenicity towards invertebrates or vertebrates are present in the w <dig> genome. examples are the ygi- <dig> mentioned above, the hydrogenase 2-  locus, fecbcde encoding an iron transporter, the ferric enterbactin transport system fepbdgc/fes, and prop encoding a betain/proline transporter involved in osmoprotection and osmoregulation.

the recently identified flagellar cluster flg- <dig>  <cit>  within the pz of w <dig> is absent in the genome of  <dig>  it comprises  <dig> genes encoding factors for the flagellar motility apparatus and for flagellar biosynthesis, but lacks chemotaxis genes . a region of approximately  <dig>  bp flanked by a transposase gene and the replicon of an incf plasmid repfib comprises an abc transporter and a regulatory gene; however, the functionality of this region, which is unique with respect to all yersinia sequences available so far, is in doubt due to its low coding density.

surface components
the main flagella and chemotaxis gene cluster i  of  <dig> is present in w <dig> , but only one of two type- <dig> fimbrial operons was found . the surface-exposed lipopolysaccharide  molecule constituting the serotype o: <dig> o-antigen is synthesized by the o-polysaccharide gene cluster   <cit> ; a second glycosyltransferase gene cluster is located on contig  <dig> . the role of the o-polysaccharide and the outer core hexasaccharide in resistance of y. enterocolitica to human complement and polymyxin b has been described recently  <cit> .

metabolism
several enzymatic activities common to both y. enterocolitica genomes compared here are involved in nitrogen metabolism. examples are the capability to catalyse urease that is encoded by seven genes on contig  <dig>  the assimilation of the urease product ammonia for amino acid and nucleotide synthesis is then achieved by glutamine synthase. two ornithine decarboxylases forming putrescine, and a putrescine/ornithine antiporter are encoded on the pz and also contribute to amino acid metabolism.

like  <dig>  strain w <dig> carries the cel gene cluster for cellulose production  and the genes mdoc, mdog and mdoh for osmoregulated periplasmic glucan  biosynthesis . both the capability to produce cellulose and to synthesize opgs have been lost or inactivated in y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis. opg mutants exhibit deficiencies in virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance, as well as hypersensitivity towards bile salts  <cit> .

the capability to utilize propanediol in a cobalamin -dependent manner is encoded on contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and the respective cob/cbi/pdu genes are collinear to the  <dig> genes ye2707-ye <dig>  in line with the yersiniae core genome, ttr genes responsible for tetrathionate reduction are present , and the eut genes allowing b12-dependent ethanolamine utilization are absent. the mtn genes located on contig  <dig> are involved in methionine salvage. this cobalamin-dependent pathway recycles methylthioadenosine derived from sperimidine, spermin and n-acylhomoserine lactone synthesis. the hydrogenases hyd- <dig> encoded within the hyf locus  and hyd- <dig> within the hyb locus  are also present in w <dig> 

distinct metabolic properties of w22703
w <dig> is endowed with several metabolic enzymes that are unique in comparison to strain  <dig> , among them a serine-pyruvate transaminase involved in glycine-, serine- and threonine-metabolism . the reductases encoded on contigs  <dig> and  <dig> suggest that w <dig>  but not  <dig>  is able to use nitrate and dimethylsulfoxide  as alternative electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions. in contrast, pathways for trimethylamine and thiosulfate oxidation are present in both genomes. beside the dmso reductase, contig  <dig> harbours another rod encoding an abc transporter, a putative nitrilase or cyanide hydratase that catalyzes nitrile into amino acids and ammonium or hydrogen cyanid into formamide, and a putative acetamidase or formamidase. contig  <dig> carries a gene cluster enabling w <dig> to uptake n-acetylgalactosamine that is then isomerized to tagatose. in addition to ye0550a-ye <dig>  we identified a second operon for sucrose utilization on contig  <dig> 

metabolic pathways lost in w22703
we identified few enzymes or capabilities that are missing in w <dig> in comparison to  <dig> . examples are the absence of a chitinase, and of the lipase ye <dig> that is probably responsible for the lipase negative reaction of w <dig> as a biotype  <dig> strain  <cit> . in addition to the arsenic resistance operon on yapiye, homologs of a second operon with this function  are absent in w <dig> 

dynamic genomes: further regions absent in w <dig> or 8081
whole genome comparison allows to follow the dynamic processes by which genomes separate from a common ancestor. in addition to genomic islands or clusters already mentioned above, the genomes of the two y. enterocolitica strains compared here differ by a set of regions, indicating the dynamic of sequence acquisition and loss. the prophage regions ye <dig> , ye <dig> , ye <dig>  and ye <dig>  of strain  <dig> are absent in strain w <dig> that, however, carries another prophage of  <dig> cds in contig  <dig>  then, the yersinia genome islands ygi- <dig>  ygi- <dig> and ygi- <dig>  <cit>  are missing in w <dig>  ygi- <dig> carries genes for the synthesis, modification, and export of an outer membrane anchored glycolipoprotein. of this island, only homologs of ye <dig> encoding a  <dig>  diketo-d-gluconic acid reductase b and of ye <dig> encoding a 3-oxo-acyl- synthase ii are present in w <dig>  on contig  <dig>  we identified two homologs of ye <dig>  which encodes a dna-binding protein, and the hypothetical gene ye <dig> from ygi <dig> harbouring a putative integrated plasmid.

discussion
the genome analysis and genome comparison performed here intended to contribute to a better understanding of the ecology, pathogenicity and evolution of y. enterocolitica. adding, rearranging and reducing or losing dna has been proposed as the general recipe for yersinia genome evolution when eight less-pathogenic strains had been compared  <cit> .

several rod shown in figure 2a-b and figure  <dig> might be recent acquisitions due to the significant deviation of their g/c content, while others might have been acquired early after separation of both strains, or indicate regions that have been lost or substituted in  <dig>  beside the virulence plasmid, the pz is a second example for the acquisition of virulence genes. remarkably, this region is approximately  <dig> kb shorter in w <dig> and lacks several determinants proposed or known to contribute to pathgenicity towards humans. together with the presence of a large ancient flagellar gene cluster and a region of obvious genetic degeneration, this finding strongly reflects the lower virulence potential of w <dig> in comparison to  <dig>  <cit> , and confirms the importance of this region for the manifestation of virulence properties of y. enterocolitica  <cit> .

other  regions absent in w <dig> might have been acquired by  <dig> after separation of both strains. the novel t3ss  that is absent in the pathogenic species y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis, but present in apathogenic species such as y. intermedia, y. frederiksenii and y. kristensenii, might play a role in the interaction with non-mammalian hosts. the tc proteins have been shown to be secreted upon activity of the plasmid-encoded t3ss of y. pestis  <cit> . since we used a pyv-free w <dig> derivative to demonstrate tc-based insecticidal activity of this strain  <cit> , ysa <dig> is a candidate for tcaa secretion by w <dig>  this finding supports the assumption that t3ss are not unique vehicles for delivering anti-vertebrate factors but ancient secretion systems for the transport of effector molecules across host membranes, with the potential to play a role in a wide range of bacteria-host interactions  <cit> . together with a number of putative virulence factors of w <dig> , ysa <dig> contributes to the pathosphere of yersiniae, a concept hypothesizing that all of the pathogenic genes shared by enteric bacteria form a "pool"  <cit> .

the pathogen y. enterocolitica has a complex life cycle encompassing aquatic and biological environments. due to its known capability to interact with invertebrates and mammals, it exhibits a multiphasic phenotype upon colonizing and potentially killing more than one host species  <cit> . although little is known about putative signals and regulatory circuits required to switch or modulate necessary changes from one state to the other, candidates are genes listed in table  <dig> or induced at low temperature  <cit> .

although some of their functions remain to be experimentally confirmed, the metabolic pathways present in strain w <dig> confirm the relevance of several metabolic traits for gut-adapted y. enterocolitica. examples are cobalamin-dependent utilization of propanediol, hydrogenase activities, cellulose production, tetrathionate reduction and ornithine decarboxylase activity, all of which are absent, lost or inactivated in systemic y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . interestingly, tetrathionate that acts as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic degradation of  <dig> -propanediol or ethanolamine is formed in the inflamed gut upon infection  <cit> . the hydrogenases hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> might contribute to the adaptation of yersiniae to gut environments  <cit> . two additional reductases of w <dig> allowing to use nitrate and dmso are in line with this assumption. a potentially insect-specific resistance mechanism and/or catabolic trait of strain w <dig> is provided by the rod of contig  <dig>  inserted between ye <dig> and ye <dig>  it encodes an acetamidase/formamidase, a branched chain amino acid transporter, an abc transporter and a putative nitrilase/cyanide hydratase. these predicted functions point to a role of this chromosomal region in the acquisition of nitrogen sources. indeed, insects such as zygaena filipendulae produce cyanogenic glucosides that might then be used by w <dig> as nitrogen source via a metabolic route of bacteria that includes cyanide nitrilase, hydratase and formate dehydrogenase activities  <cit> . although speculative so far, the functions of contig  <dig> might represent a further determinant contributing to invertebrate host adaptation of strain w <dig>  the operon on contig  <dig> including a pts is responsible for tagatose utilization; this metabolic trait is not only common to human intestinal bacteria, but was found to be specifically induced during insect infection by p. luminescens  <cit> . interestingly, the pz gene bsh encodes a chologlycin hydrolase or bile salt hydrolase  that catalyzes the deconjugation of conjugated bile salts to liberate amino acids and free primary bile acids  <cit> .

recently, a genome comparison between the genomes of the insect pathogen p. luminescens and y. enterocolitica  <dig> revealed a huge number of common genes that might contribute to the adaptation of yersiniae to invertebrate hosts  <cit> . interestingly, we identified nearly all of these factors also in the genome of w <dig>  underlining the assumption that y. enterocolitica strains share the capability to interact with nematodes or insects.

CONCLUSIONS
although further genome sequences are required to learn more about the evolution of y. enterocolitica strains, this study indicates that beside the yersinia virulence plasmids, the highly flexible pz indeed contributes to the acquisition of determinants that might increase the pathogenicity towards humans. on the other hand, insecticidal toxins, the novel t3ss or specific metabolic properties might play a crucial role for the adaptation of y. enterocolitica strains to non-mammalian hosts.
