BACKGROUND
in mammals, a single progranulin gene, also known as proepithelin, acrogranin and pc-cell-derived growth factor , encodes a glycoprotein precursor exhibiting pleiotropic tissue growth factor activity . progranulin is secreted in an intact form  <cit> , or undergoes proteolysis leading to the release of its constituent peptides, the granulins  <cit> . individual granulins have an approximate molecular weight of  <dig> kda, and are structurally defined by the presence of  <dig> cysteines arranged in a characteristic motif: x2–3cx5–6cx5ccx8ccx6ccx5ccx4cx5–6cx <dig>  <cit> . comparison of the biosynthetic origin of granulin peptides in various mammals reveals that all are commonly derived from a precursor composed of one amino-terminal half followed by seven non-identical copies of the granulin motif.

a role of progranulin in mammalian embryogenesis has been suggested. the exogenous addition of recombinant progranulin to eight-cell stage mouse embryos grown in culture ex vivo accelerates the onset of cavitation, stimulates the rate of blastocoel expansion, and leads to an increase in the number of trophectoderm cells compared to controls  <cit> . conversely, the use of a progranulin function-blocking antibody arrests growth and prohibits embryo implantation  <cit> . these results are consistent with the growth-promoting activity of progranulin upon epithelial cells in vitro.

despite these advances, the evolutionary history and phylogenetic distribution of the progranulin gene outside the mammalian radiation remain largely unexplored. in order to shed light on this issue, and to establish a model for studying the functional contribution of progranulin to vertebrate development, we undertook the characterization of the biosynthetic origins of progranulins in the zebrafish. the widely documented evidence in favor of a pan-genomic duplication event at the base of the teleost radiation  <cit> , commonly referred to as 3r, predicts that the single mammalian progranulin gene will likely be represented by two zebrafish co-orthologues  <cit> . results reported here demonstrate that, in zebrafish, progranulins arise as members of an extended gene family represented by two distinct architectures, in excess of that predicted by 3r.

comparative chromosomal mapping of the various progranulin genes  was performed to assist in the establishment of an orthologous relationship to their mammalian counterpart and to provide a point of reference to discuss the evolutionary origins of the distinct progranulin architectures. in support of the duplication-degeneration-complementation  model  <cit>  gene expression analysis of the zebrafish progranulins reveals spatio-temporal divergence among the different family members, possibly reflecting extensive functional devolution of an ancestral form. also, the occurrence of natural antisense transcription to some grns suggests that gene dosage may have influenced the retention of extra grn paralogues in zebrafish.

RESULTS
evidence for a progranulin multigene family in teleosts
a previous study indicated that major forms of granulin peptides found in hematopoietic organs of carp, cyprinus carpio, differ in their relative abundance  <cit> . specifically, extracts of carp spleen contained granulin- <dig> only, while the head kidney contained granulins- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  arguing that some granulins found in teleost fish, unlike those found in mammals, have different biosynthetic origins  <cit> . we revisited the issue of the sole occurrence of granulin- <dig> in carp spleen and confirmed the earlier report. however, granulin- <dig> was found to co-purify with another member of the granulin family . sequencing of this peptide suggested that it is a close homologue of mammalian granulin-a, sharing 58% identity with the human peptide . the isolation of a carp granulin peptide homologous to mammalian granulin-a suggested that teleosts synthesize a protein equivalent to mammalian progranulin. carp is a tetraploid species known to express multiple copies of closely related genes that can complicate the study of the origins of multigene families  <cit> . therefore, we chose to study the structure and expression of granulin genes in the zebrafish, a closely-related diploid teleost of the cyprinoforme order  <cit> .

zebrafish progranulins are represented by two distinct architectures
progranulin- <dig> and progranulin-2
a pcr-based strategy using degenerate primers based on the amino acid sequence of carp granulin- <dig> led to the cloning of two zebrafish cdnas sharing  <dig> % identity and encoding structures homologous to carp granulin- <dig> and granulin- <dig>  respectively . in contrast with mammalian progranulins, the deduced architecture of these zebrafish precursors, named progranulin- <dig>  and progranulin- <dig> , consist of one full and one amino-terminal half granulin-like repeats only . unlike progranulins a and b , no potential n-glycosylation sites are found within the predicted progranulin- <dig> or progranulin- <dig> polypeptide structures. subsequent cloning of the respective genes for grn <dig> and grn <dig> revealed that each is encoded on five exons , confirming that they are derived from distinct transcriptional units. the genomic sequences encoding grn <dig> and grn <dig> are interrupted by short introns in the exact equivalent positions to that observed within the mammalian grn gene  <cit> . sequences at the splice junctions for the grn <dig>  grn <dig> and asgrn1- <dig> genes are depicted in additional file  <dig> 

hybrid grn rna
a cdna encoding a hybrid progranulin identical in size to, and sharing  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity with both grn <dig> and grn <dig>  was uncovered through our cloning strategy . the nucleotide substitutions for hybrid progranulin are non-randomly distributed among the exons for grn <dig> and grn <dig>  indicating that it is likely derived from the joining of the first two exons of grn <dig> with exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of grn <dig> . a hybrid of the opposite character was not detected . no evidence was found to suggest the existence of additional genomic sequences corresponding to grn <dig> or grn <dig>  raising the possibility of a post-transcriptional mechanism underlying the origin of this chimeric structure.

antisense progranulin1- <dig> gene
during the cloning of grn <dig>  genomic sequences were used to perform blast searches for sequences deposited at ncbi  <cit> . an est was detected  whose sequence was an exact match to a portion of the grn <dig> gene, but in the reverse complement orientation. the full characterization of this est, designated asgrn1- <dig>  revealed that it is spliced and shares exonic complementarity to exons  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition to flanking intronic sequences, of both grn <dig> and grn <dig> genes . this observation suggested that grn <dig> is located upstream of grn <dig> in a head-to-tail organization, thus providing strong support for trans-splicing between the grn <dig> and grn <dig> primary transcripts as a mechanism for the genesis of the hybrid progranulin rna .

in addition to its partial complementarity to grn <dig> and grn <dig>  the last exon of the asgrn1- <dig> gene  shares a high degree of sequence conservation with the tzf transposon  <cit> , a subclass belonging to the tc1/mariner superfamily of class ii dna mobile elements  <cit> . however, this mobile element is in the reverse complement orientation within the antisense transcript, and has undergone extensive mutations resulting from nucleotide insertions, deletions and point mutations . thus, asgrn1- <dig> never possessed the ability to encode a translatable transposase protein, nor does it have a clearly predictable orf in view of the presence of several termination codons in all three possible reading frames. for these reasons, this naturally occurring antisense transcript is considered to belong to the category of non-coding rna genes.

the zebrafish co-orthologues of mammalian progranulin
based on the finding of a carp granulin peptide whose sequence was homologous to mammalian forms of granulin , it was reasoned that these observations could be extended to the zebrafish. using a strategy identical to that used for cloning a cdna encoding granulin- <dig>  we isolated a partial cdna encoding a deduced zebrafish granulin-a peptide . blast searches using this sequence retrieved two distinct ests from genbank databases , the former being identical to our cloned sequence. sequencing of these cdnas, referred to as progranulin-a  and progranulin-b  respectively, revealed that each encodes a deduced granulins precursor bearing  <dig> and  <dig> tandemly repeated and non-identical granulin domains , demonstrating that the zebrafish progranulin repertoire is not limited to the simplified grn gene structures.

zebrafish progranulin-a and progranulin-b are  <dig> % identical over their aligned sequences, and each is similarly related to human progranulin with  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity, respectively. as expected, sequence conservation is seen primarily within the aligned granulin domains of the zebrafish precursors . however, the deduced granulins within the zebrafish grna and grnb precursors cannot be aligned strictly on the basis of the mammalian nomenclature   <cit> . indeed, progranulin-a contains five granulin peptides  whose sequences bear close sequence similarity with one-another and with that of human granulin-a. in addition, zebrafish progranulin-a encodes a deduced granulin structure  displaying the modified cysteine motif found in human granulin g, which is characterized by the absence of cysteine residues  <dig> and  <dig> .

northern blot analysis
the size of the cloned sense and antisense zebrafish progranulin transcripts was assessed by northern blot analysis . with the exception of the putative asgrna , the observed transcript sizes were in agreement with those predicted from cloned sequences. however, many pre-mrna transcripts of higher than expected molecular weight were identified for several family members. only grnb demonstrated the presence of splice variants of unknown composition.

chromosomal mapping of zebrafish grns
the chromosomal localization of each grn gene was determined using the ln <dig> radiation-reduced mapping panel  <cit> . primers are listed in additional file  <dig>  grn <dig> and grn <dig> are closely linked on linkage group   <dig>   <dig>  centirays  from est clone fb47h <dig> in the vicinity of the simple sequence length polymorphism  marker z <dig> consistent with their physical proximity deduced from the cloning of a chimeric transcript . grna is located on lg <dig>   <dig>  cr from sslp marker z <dig>  in a region showing a clear syntenic correspondence with the chromosomal position of murine and human grn . in contrast, grnb maps next to sslp marker z <dig>  and is  <dig>  cr from est fc18g <dig>  located on lg <dig> , and is not part of a known block of conserved synteny with zebrafish lg <dig> or human chromosome  <dig> 

assessment of zebrafish grn gene expression by rt-pcr
zebrafish grn gene expression in adult tissues
semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses were performed to examine the relative expression of the individual members of the zebrafish grn gene family in adult tissues. a list of primers used and size of the respective amplicons is listed in additional file  <dig>  both grna and grnb are expressed in all adult tissues examined, including the gills, heart, multiple visceral organs, and at modest levels in the brain . comparison of the expression of the smaller zebrafish paralogues  relative to their mutual antisense gene in selected adult zebrafish organs , showed that the combined expression of grn <dig> and grn <dig> was qualitatively similar to that of grna and grnb . in contrast to the widespread combined expression of grn <dig> and grn <dig>  low levels of asgrn1- <dig> transcripts are detected in the blood and intestine . in agreement with the observed carp peptide expression profiles  <cit> , the zebrafish spleen expresses grn <dig> only . in tissues that display overlapping expression, grn <dig> is the predominant form in the heart and intestine, while the eyes express higher levels of grn <dig> . surprisingly, low abundance of the hybrid grn transcript, the authenticity of which was confirmed by sequencing of the amplicon, is detected exclusively in the intestine .

developmental expression of zebrafish grn genes
since divergence in expression patterns between duplicated genes is suspected to promote their retention  <cit> , the temporal regulation of grn gene expression between the two grn gene classes during development was investigated by rt-pcr. transcripts for both grna and grnb are maternally provided although grnb is more abundant . this trend continues following commencement of zygotic transcription until mid-epiboly  where both transcripts are present at similar levels . in contrast, combined grn <dig> and grn <dig> expression is first noticeable during the late pharyngula period by  <dig> hours post-fertilization  . when using an increased number of cycling, the combined expression of grn <dig> and grn <dig> is detected as early as  <dig> hpf, while antisense transcript levels remain too low for detection using conventional ethidium bromide staining . southern blot analysis demonstrates that antisense transcription occurs, albeit weakly, at  <dig> hpf and becomes more evident by  <dig> hpf .

assessment of zebrafish grn gene expression by whole mount in situ hybridization
in order to evaluate the relationship between sense and antisense transcription, and to gain insights into the potential contributions of the four grn paralogues to development, the spatio-temporal expression of zebrafish grns was monitored by whole-mount in situ hybridization. for all stages examined, sense and antisense riboprobes for sonic hedgehog were used as experimental controls since the tissue expression of this gene is discrete and well documented  <cit> . no non-specific hybridization signal for sonic hedgehog was detected . unless stated otherwise, the respective sense riboprobes to grna and grnb did not give rise to detectable signals.

grna and grnb
the low abundance of transcripts for grna relative to grnb revealed by rt-pcr during early embryogenesis  is reflected in the relative signal intensity for these transcripts by whole-mount in situ hybridization from the 4-cell to late segmentation stage  . weak, ubiquitous grna expression can first be detected by  <dig> hpf , with slightly stronger signal in the hypoblast . grnb expression remains similarly ubiquitous, however defined regions of heightened expression are evident including in the hypoblast, central nervous system , optic epithelial layers, ear primordium, lateral plate mesoderm  and tailbud . as the embryo matures to late segmentation stages , low levels of grna expression become confined to the eyes, tectum and tailbud , whereas grnb expression undergoes further regionalization within the eyes and cns, the caudal region of the notochord and surrounding adaxial cells, and in the yolk syncytial layer  . during the pharyngula period  and hatching stage , overlapping expression patterns between grna and grnb include the pharyngeal and anterior visceral endoderm, the skin epidermis , and the pronephric tubules, albeit at modest levels . in addition, both genes are expressed temporally within the apical ectodermal ridge  between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . divergent expression of the zebrafish co-orthologues of mammalian progranulin is also notable during this period . for instance, only grna is strongly expressed in the intermediate cell mass  caudal region, the lens and retina as well as the tectum of the  <dig> hpf embryo . grna is also uniquely expressed at low levels within the forming head vasculature and aorta at  <dig> hpf , and exhibits relatively increased leukocytic expression from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf . in contrast to that observed for grna, grnb is expressed within the ysl and often found concentrated at the end of the yolk extension. sustained high levels of grnb were observed within the brain at all stages examined  and in the swim bladder by  <dig> hpf . patterns observed during the hatching period generally persist and are accentuated in the  <dig> day-old larva . in addition, grna can be detected in the epithelial lining of various visceral organs, in particular the pharynx, intestine, swim bladder and pronephric ducts . weak staining in the dorsal aorta but not the posterior cardinal vein can sometimes be noticed in whole-mount and through sectioning of the animal . likewise, grnb is widely expressed in the visceral region of the larval stage animal, in particular the intestine, pancreas and ysl . weak expression is also detected for both genes in the olfactory epithelium and in the presumptive thymus as bilateral patches located caudal to the eyes .

the sense riboprobe corresponding to grna but not grnb detects staining in the brain, intestine and pronephros at this stage , suggesting either non-specific hybridization or the presence of an antisense transcript. this observation prompted a search for sequences deposited at genbank corresponding to parts of the grna cdna sequence, but in the reverse complement orientation. three unidirectionally cloned ests  were all revealed upon sequencing to correspond to a  <dig> nucleotide long cdna sharing perfect complementarity to nucleotides 2701– <dig> of the grna cdna . this sequence corresponds to the 3'utr region of the grna gene and is not bisected by an intron at the genomic level. this precludes the conclusion that this candidate antisense transcript is not an artifact of cloning. to confirm its directionality, cdna was synthesized for subsequent pcr amplification using a primer located within the 3'utr exon of grna that shared complementarity to asgrna  or using another primer that was located downstream of the cloned asgrna sequence and within a known intron for grna . this rt-pcr strategy suggests that the asgrna deduced from cloned est sequences may represent a splice variant, and that antisense transcription extends further in the 3'direction .

grn <dig> and grn2
as expected from the rt-pcr data , expression for grn <dig> or grn <dig> is not detected by in situ hybridization in early development . expression of grn <dig> is detected in the intestine and the pharyngeal region of the 3-day old animal  and at very low levels in the pronephros . grn <dig> does not share this expression pattern and is detected at low levels in the proctodeum  and is often detected in a few sporadic peripheral leukocytes . in contrast hybrid grn is detected at relatively high levels in the proctodeum. . this specific expression pattern is confirmed by examining the signal obtained using sense riboprobes corresponding to grn <dig> and grn <dig> that, after prolonged exposure, detect weak signals from their complementary transcript  in the pharyngeal region of these animals . notably, the use of a sense riboprobe corresponding to hybrid grn  does not replicate the expression pattern observed for asgrn1- <dig> .

in the  <dig> day-old larva, specific grn <dig> expression is observed in the intestine and the swim bladder, whereas low levels can be seen in the pharynges . elevated levels of expression for grn <dig> in the brain, the pharyngeal jaw region, and in presumed peripheral leukocytes , contrast with the pattern observed for grn <dig>  however, both genes share higher levels of expression in the anterior or head kidneys and pronephric ducts . in situ hybridization of cross sections of the animals indicates that grn <dig> and grn <dig> expression, like that of grna and grnb, occurs in the epithelial lining of the visceral organs . the chimeric transcript remained restricted to the proctodeum where it is expressed more abundantly than grn <dig>  and was not detected in leukocytes at this stage . in turn, the antisense gene to grn <dig> and grn <dig> is expressed in the brain, swim bladder, and the middle segment of the intestine .

discussion
zebrafish progranulins: simplified molecular forms and orthologues of the mammalian gene
the granulin peptide family was originally discovered as a component of the granule fraction of mammalian phagocytic leukocytes. a series of related cysteine-rich peptides  were purified from extracts of human neutrophils  <cit> . the definition of the structure of human progranulin as a glycoprotein bearing multiple copies of the granulin motif made it apparent that granulin peptides are generated through proteolytic cleavage of this precursor within the phagolysosomal compartment of the neutrophil. this explains the roughly equimolar ratios observed for members of the granulin family that are co-packaged within this subcellular compartment. the hematopoietic tissues  of the carp  were also shown to be abundant sources of three granulin-like peptides   <cit> . however, the non-stoichiometric ratios observed for carp granulins- <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> suggested that the granulin gene family in this teleost species may expand beyond the prototypic single grn gene found in mammals. specifically, carp spleen contains mainly granulin- <dig>  whereas granulins- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were found in extracts of the head kidney . to simplify the identification of teleost granulin gene family members, the zebrafish  was chosen based on its usefulness as a model of vertebrate development and disease.

the presence of extra gene paralogues in teleost fish has been extensively documented, often  <cit>  but not invariably supporting  <cit>  the hypothesis that the actinopterygian  lineage underwent an additional round of genome duplication  subsequent to diverging from the sarcopterygian  lineage approximately  <dig> mya. specific examples include the hox clusters  <cit> , the annexins  <cit> , the claudins  <cit>  and the nodal-related genes squint and cyclops  <cit> . further, comparative chromosomal mapping studies have shown that duplicated zebrafish genes often reside on distinct chromosomes that exhibit extensive blocs of conserved synteny with their mammalian counterpart  <cit> . using this approach, it has been estimated that approximately 20% of human genes may be represented by two co-orthologues in the genome of zebrafish  <cit> .

as predicted by 3r, we demonstrate that grns are members of an extended gene family in zebrafish. we have identified two deduced precursors, progranulins a and b, harbouring  <dig> and  <dig> granulin peptide repeats respectively that bear close structural and sequence relationship to human progranulin . grna was localized to a region of lg <dig> known to show syntenic correspondence to where human grn is found on human chromosome  <dig> . grnb was localized to lg  <dig> rather than being positioned on lg <dig>  predicted to bear synteny with lg <dig>  <cit> . despite this apparent discrepancy, a co-orthologous relationship between grna and grnb relative to mammalian grn is supported by their sequence conservation as well as their extensive overlapping expression patterns observed during development.

two smaller grn genes, grn <dig> and grn <dig>  each encoding one full and one amino-terminal half copies only of the granulin motif, were also characterized . interestingly, a common ancestry of the smaller zebrafish grn genes with grna and grnb, and thus mammalian grn, is implied by conservation of the strict exonic organization that these genes display. however, it is unlikely that grn <dig> and grn <dig> arose from the postulated whole genome duplication event corresponding to 3r since they were found to be localized in tandem on lg <dig> . it is notable that both grn <dig> and grn <dig> are linked to a hox cluster and dlx gene paralogues, similar to that observed for grna. this suggests that a smaller grn may have originated coincidentally with the duplication of a hox-bearing chromosome in a primordial species. evidence suggests that this putative structure would then have been retained within the teleosts but lost within the sarcopterygian line of evolution leading to mammals.

analysis of progranulin expression by rt-pcr
the ddc model predicts that an important driving force behind the retention of duplicated genes is the devolution of an ancestral function onto the resultant pair through quantitative and qualitative changes in gene expression which, when combined, may reflect the sum of the ancestral expression pattern  <cit> . thus, it was of interest to determine the extent of expression partitioning and overlap between the two grn gene classes during development by rt-pcr and to compare these patterns to those known for the mammalian counterpart.

as an initial survey of the differential expression patterns of the zebrafish grns, we conducted semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses using adult tissues and staged embryos. similar to the well documented widespread expression pattern of human  <cit> , rat  <cit> , mouse and guinea pig  <cit> grns in several tissues and cell lines of epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic origin, both grna and grnb were observed to be expressed ubiquitously in several adult zebrafish organs. in contrast, grn <dig> and grn <dig> exhibit a more restricted pattern of expression. it was previously shown that carp granulin- <dig> and granulin- <dig> peptides are differently distributed in the spleen and head kidneys of the carp  <cit> . interestingly, rt-pcr experiments demonstrate that the expression of the homologous structures in zebrafish were similarly uncoupled at the level of mrna, , reflected in a lack of detectable zebrafish grn <dig> expression in adult spleen. also, grn <dig> appears to be the predominant form in the heart, while the eyes express higher levels of grn <dig>  whether the widespread pattern of expression for zebrafish grns is due in part to leukocyte entrapment in some organs, cells known to express granulins in carp  <cit>  and goldfish  <cit>  cannot be determined using this experimental approach.

other notable differences in the expression of the paralogous and orthologous pairs of genes were observed. first, maternal transcripts for grna and grnb are readily detectable, with grnb showing higher abundance than grna until early somitogenesis when the two genes become expressed at similar levels . in contrast, although very low levels of grn <dig> mrna are also detected in the newly-fertilized egg, the combined expression of grn <dig> and grn <dig> only becomes detectable by  <dig> hpf, at a stage when most organogenesis is well advanced . thus, the absence of grn <dig> and grn <dig> expression prior to the onset of zygotic expression argues that these genes are functionally dispensable in early embryogenesis.

analysis of progranulin expression by whole mount in situ hybridization
early expression
in order to determine possible roles for the grns during development, their spatio-temporal distribution was examined by whole mount in situ hybridization. overall, grna and grnb expression patterns share conserved features with their murine orthologue in the early embryo. transcripts for both zebrafish co-orthologues are maternally deposited and remain ubiquitously expressed subsequent to the onset of zygotic transcription . similarly, in a pattern that reflects the replacement of maternal mrnas with zygotically expressed transcripts  <cit> , murine grn mrna levels fall rapidly after egg fertilization, reaching negligible levels as early as the 2-cell stage, but rise again to detectable levels by the eight-cell stage  <cit>  notably, this precedes the morula stage and subsequent blastocyst stage when the epithelium is first formed. it is interesting to note that during zebrafish epiboly, which comprises the morphogenetic movements of the blastoderm towards the vegetal pole , grna and grnb are still ubiquitous but more intense in the outer enveloping monolayer of cells , which ultimately will give rise to an epithelium covering the blastoderm. expression of these grns in the evl and later in the skin ectoderm is reminiscent of the more elevated levels of expression for grn in the apical surface of the mouse blastocyst epithelium, the trophectoderm, relative to the inner cell mass population  <cit> .

cns
although several regions display increased expression of grna and grnb during brain segmentation , regional specificity is more apparent at  <dig> hpf. distinct or non-overlapping patterns observed include grna expression within the tectum and a more expansive grnb expression pattern encompassing the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, tegmentum and telencephalon . despite the expression of both grna and grnb in the epithelial lining of the eyes and lens, transient expression within the retina and tectum is noticeable for grna only, suggesting that this orthologue may affect the development of the retinotectal projections. similar functions may also be implied for mammalian grn, given its expression within the retinal glia during murine development  <cit> . interestingly, murine grn expression is abundant throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, similar to that observed for grnb at later developmental time points within the zebrafish cns . the generally unrestricted gene expression pattern suggests a role for progranulin in cell survival or proliferation or as a competence factor. indeed, mammalian grn has been demonstrated to be a potent glial cell mitogen in vitro  <cit>  and is consistently up-regulated in malignant human gliomas  <cit> . grn <dig> and asgrn1- <dig> but not grn <dig> demonstrate similar unrestricted expression within the zebrafish brain . taken together these expression patterns suggest that cns development in the zebrafish may involve a functional interplay between the various molecular forms of granulin.

the only known functional and physiological contribution that grn gene expression is known to make during neural maturation is its involvement in the sexual differentiation of the male rat brain. it has been shown that male sexual behaviour is associated with steroid-dependent grn expression in the male neonatal hypothalamus  <cit> . similar distinctions in grn gene expression were not determined in the present study given that sexual differentiation of zebrafish gonads occurs much later and spans roughly 21– <dig> dpf  <cit> .

endoderm
the expression of the zebrafish grn gene family members also displays overlapping and distinctive patterns with respect to the endoderm and tissues derived from this germ layer. at  <dig> hpf both grna and grnb can be found within the pharyngeal and foregut endoderm, whereas only the latter is located within the ysl . both transcripts maintain a degree of dispersed endodermal expression until  <dig> hpf where grna is located within the epithelial lining of the stomach and anterior intestine while grnb can be found within the ysl, pancreas and proctodeum .

unlike the expression of grna and grnb, the paralogues grn <dig>  grn <dig> and hybrid granulin are highly abundant and for the most part restricted to pharyngeal and visceral endodermal derivatives from  <dig> hpf onward. although grn <dig> and grn <dig> demonstrate some endodermal tissue-specific expression, these transcripts often co-localize . the restricted expression of hybrid granulin within the proctodeum is particularly striking . consistent with the manner in which the hybrid transcript is formed, both grn <dig> and grn <dig> are likewise expressed in the proctodeum. however, expression of these two transcripts overlaps within a large portion of the intestine and stomach where no hybrid grn transcript is found. this suggests that wherever the hybrid grn is observed, the generation of this chimeric peptide must be a highly regulated process and that a specific function is implied.

in contrast to the observed grn distribution in zebrafish, murine grn is not detected within developing endodermal derivatives, with the exception of adult deep crypt enterocytes  <cit> . this suggests that mammalian dependence on grn expression may be developmentally restricted to endodermal-epithelial transitions in the gut or subsequent maintenance of this organ. alternatively, it is possible that endodermal expression of zebrafish grns reflects a species-specific requirement.

hematopoietic tissue
of particular interest in regards to functional equivalence between species and functional separation between duplicated co-orthologues, is the almost complete partitioning of grn hematopoietic expression onto grna and to a much lesser extent grn <dig>  in zebrafish, primitive hematopoiesis occurs within the anterior icm from where nucleated erythroblasts originate and myeloid cells that can be seen circulating at  <dig> hpf  <cit> . hematopoietic stem cells  are then believed to populate the dorsal aorta and yolk sac which represent the zebrafish equivalent of the mammalian aorta-gonad-mesonephros, the tissue presumed to be responsible for later definitive erythropoiesis  <cit> . the posterior icm, located within the ventral tail and positive for molecular markers of all three hematopoietic lineages, may represent a secondary zebrafish hsc population or region required for hsc maturation  <cit> . unlike the murine model, zebrafish definitive hematopoiesis undergoes a migratory transition from the dorsal aorta/ventral tail to the kidney , without the involvement of liver or bone marrow.

in accordance with expression patterns mentioned previously, grna only acquires distinctive tissue-specificity at  <dig> hpf, as is the case for its prevalence within the caudal icm , restricting its involvement to definitive hematopoietic waves. grna can be found at low levels within the dorsal aorta at  <dig> hpf  and is highly expressed within the caudal-ventral tail region throughout all stages post- <dig> hpf , suggesting its involvement in multiple hematopoietic lineages. significantly, sustained grna expression in this hematopoietic organ is coupled with the appearance of grna-expressing leukocytes dispersed throughout the animal with levels that peak at approximately  <dig> hpf . thus grna expression in presumed granulocytes all over the body of the animal may suggest its involvement in the innate immune response of the host. grn <dig> expression is also found within peripheral leukocytes, but in a sporadic pattern that is distinct from that observed for grna. whether these differences reflect leukocyte sub-populations or activation states for these cells has not been addressed. commensurate with the transition of icm to kidney as the major site of hematopoiesis, grna can be found within the pronephric ducts  along with grn <dig> and grn <dig>  which are also present in the head kidney .

mammalian grn exhibits a similar expression pattern, particularly in neutrophils. furthermore, murine grn can modulate the inflammatory response during wound healing, acting as both a chemokinetic factor and inhibitor of neutrophil degranulation and respiratory burst  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether grna supports a similar role in zebrafish.

chimeric transcription
during the initial degenerate primer amplification of cdnas encoding grn <dig> and  <dig>  a third cdna was cloned and identified as sharing strict identity with portions of both grn <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, this granulin-hybrid showed 100% identity with exons  <dig> and  <dig> of grn- <dig>  and with exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of grn- <dig>  suggesting that this hybrid cdna may represent a splicing of granulin- <dig> and  <dig> primary transcripts . chimeric transcripts usually result from one of the following mechanisms: chromosomal translocations, transcription of neighboring genes as a single transcription unit or alternative splicing in trans. in all cases, joining of exons is predicted to occur through the recognition of canonical splice acceptor and donor sites.

a hybrid granulin structure has been previously reported through cloning of cdna sequences in the rat  <cit> . specifically, a structural splice variant of progranulin cdna was retrieved and predicted to encode a granulin domain consisting of the amino-terminal domain of granulin-c fused to the carboxyl-terminal domain of granulin-d, consistent with the removal of an exon from the larger primary transcript  <cit> . the zebrafish hybrid grn described here likely originates through a mechanism other than alternative splicing from a larger primary transcript since the grn <dig> gene is located 5' to the grn <dig> gene . this topology was confirmed through the cloning and structural analysis of the partially complementary asgrn1- <dig> gene. also, we found no evidence for the presence of additional grn1-like genomic sequences located upstream of the grn <dig> gene, or elsewhere in the genome by southern analysis . in particular, no equivalent of carp grn <dig> was found in zebrafish. these observations suggest that the presence of hybrid grn in zebrafish likely occurs through a splicing reaction in trans between grn <dig> and grn <dig> pre-mrnas, similar to the mechanism originally documented in trypanosomatids  <cit> . although rare, scrambled or intergenic rna molecules consisting of exons originating from distinct genes through a trans-splicing reaction have also been documented in vertebrates. for instance, acyl-coa:cholesterol acyltransferase- <dig>  and the cyp3a family of p <dig> cytochrome genes produce hybrid mrna variants in humans  <cit> . trans-splicing of the voltage-gated sodium channel in response to nerve growth factor stimulation, further suggests that this alternative mode of splicing can be a regulated process  <cit> . indeed, there is evidence suggesting that splicing in trans may be facilitated through the recognition of regulatory elements within transcript sequences called splicing enhancers that require binding of sr proteins for activity  <cit> . whether grn <dig> or grn <dig> harbour a necessary enhancer sequence that could explain the directionality of hybrid grn is currently not known. we believe the hybrid granulin represents the first example of trans-splicing with regards to the modification of a growth factor gene product.

antisense transcription
although the majority of deposited zebrafish est library sequencing confirmed the existence of grn <dig> and grn <dig>  one particular sequence  corresponded to the exact reverse complement to both grn <dig> and grn <dig> within the same exon/intron spanning region , and was named asgrn1- <dig> accordingly. in addition, asgrn1- <dig> harbours sequences for an extensively mutated tzf transposon  in its last exon, but in the reverse complement orientation . despite its polyadenylation, the lack of an orf classifies asgrn1- <dig> as a non-coding rna. to our knowledge, asgrn1- <dig> represents the first example of a single spliced transcript with antisense complementarity to two tandemly organized paralogous protein-coding genes.

the existence of asgrn1- <dig> has potential implications in aspects of grn <dig> and grn <dig> function. classically, antisense transcripts often function as inhibitors of the expression of their associated gene, through repression of transcription or promotion of mrna degradation. there is the possibility that asgrn1- <dig> is involved in the formation of hybrid grn wherein this complementary transcript may provide a scaffold to sequester grn <dig> and grn <dig> mrna transcripts within the same intracellular locale, preventing or alternatively facilitating the trans-splicing reaction.

regarding the rt-pcr data, despite evidence of clear tissue-specific and temporal asgrn1- <dig> expression in adult tissues and various developmental stages respectively, this transcript shows no clear reciprocal relationship to grn <dig> or grn <dig> . these expression patterns were confirmed at all stages examined using sense riboprobes for grn <dig>  grn <dig>  and verified for specificity by using the corresponding sense riboprobe to hybrid grn as negative control . at  <dig> dpf, asgrn1- <dig> is expressed in the presumed hyoid ossification center, stomach and rostral intestine, as well as swim bladder . although grn <dig> and grn <dig> are found within most of these tissues , specific expression of asgrn1- <dig> in the hyoid region undergoing osteogenesis may suggest the required down-regulation of the expression of its counterpart genes during bone development. therefore a reciprocal relationship may exist between these genes under strict spatio-temporal regulation. although asgrn1- <dig> may mediate a degradation independent mode of gene regulation, such as alternative splicing, it clearly does not perform as a universal negative regulator of grn <dig> and grn <dig> expression.

at least one type of transcription modulation may be associated with asgrn1- <dig> based on whole mount in situ hybridization analysis. there is a clear reciprocal relationship between hybrid grn expression and absence of asgrn1- <dig> transcription. at  <dig> hpf, hybrid grn is restricted to the distal intestine and despite the expression of its substrate transcripts within several other locales, no other grn1/grn <dig> rich setting is devoid of asgrn1- <dig> . this pattern further suggests that asgrn1- <dig> expression prevents formation of the hybrid grn rna.

the existence of asgrn1- <dig> suggested that an equivalent entity may exist for one or both co-orthologues, grna and grnb. indeed, the sense probe for grna in whole mount in situ hybridization analysis produced a consistent and reproducible signal within the intestine and pronephric ducts at  <dig> dpf . several unidirectionally cloned cdnas  were found to correspond to the reverse complement sequence of grna within the 3'utr. northern blot analysis using sense grna demonstrated a putative  <dig> kb transcript and directional cdna synthesis followed by rt-pcr indicated this putative antisense transcript extended within the known grna intronic sequence. however, repeated attempts to clone the full-length transcript by race were unsuccessful. nevertheless, these observations provide evidence for the existence of a second naturally occurring grn complementary transcript, namely asgrna.

the granulin motif – phylogenetic and functional implications
the granulin motif is so distinctive that it is a relatively simple matter to search the protein and nucleotide databases to obtain an impression of its phylogenetic origins. figure  <dig> shows a diagrammatic representation of the nature of proteins bearing the granulin motif that can be confidently predicted through searching the cdna, est and/or genome sequence databases using blast  <cit> . the numbers of full granulin modules present in each putative protein is shown in cartoon form together with an impression of the phylogenetic origins of the species involved. the source of the sequence data used to predict these structures is listed as accession numbers in the legend to figure  <dig>  the distribution of some of the proteins bearing the granulin motif within assorted species has been partially annotated and can be viewed at various web sites  <cit> . with some interesting exceptions , the granulin motif can be found throughout eukaryotes, both in plants and multicellular animals. in contrast there is no representation within fungi or unicellular organisms. the presence of a protein bearing the granulin motif within the slime mold  is particularly revealing since this organism is thought to be a modern representative of an amoeboid organism that was a transition species between unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes  <cit> . the appearance of this organism is thought to predate the divergence of plants and animals about  <dig>  billion years ago. this suggests that a primordial gene bearing a single granulin motif evolved once during this transition period. the plant motif is found in just one context as a carboxyl-terminal domain of a cysteine protease that is found in many members of the viridiplantae including arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  . together this suggests that the founding granulin gene was represented by a single copy and composed of a single granulin motif.

in contrast to the conserved protease/granulin gene architecture found in plants, members of the animal kingdom have expanded their granulin repertoire, not via genomic or segmental duplication, but rather through tandem multiplication of the granulin orf. for instance the xenopus leavis and the early chordate ciona intestinalis granulin genes encode of five and six tandemly repeated near identical granulin motifs, respectively. the variance in the number of granulin intragenic regions demonstrates a degree of plasticity during grn gene expansion. intragenic multiplication is unlikely to have occurred as a single ancestral event; rather grn gene expansion has taken place independently in various species to varying extents. this mechanism of conserved domain repetition is not unique to grn genes. indeed, the same type of genetic expansion is likely responsible for the repetition of immunoglobulin, egf and lectin domains in numerous proteins.

the presence of single grn genes in protostomes is not surprising since the origins of these species predate the estimated genomic duplications within the vertebrate radiation ; these large-scale events appear not to have given rise to grn gene expansion. specifically, all members of the sarcopterygian lineage  harbour a single granulin gene of varying motif number, indicating that intragenic multiplication remains the preferred and tolerated means of granulin expansion for most vertebrates, including mammals. the same intolerance to gene duplication has not encompassed the actinopterygians , including danio rerio and takifugu rubripes. these species have undoubtedly expanded their granulin gene repertoire through tandem intragenic expansion as well as genome duplication , to yield the co-orthologues grna and grnb. interestingly, the existence of grn <dig> and grn <dig> does not necessarily conform to these methods of gene expansion, suggesting that a specific and unidentified means of gene expansion, possibly involving asgrn1- <dig>  may exist.

CONCLUSIONS
although the existence of two co-orthologues of mammalian progranulin in zebrafish is likely a result of genome-wide duplication, similar genetic events have occurred within chordates prior to divergence of the ray-finned  and lobe-finned  radiations. indeed two rounds of genome-wide duplication are believed to have occurred  <cit> . more precisely, the first genome duplication probably occurred in a common ancestor of all agnathans and gnathostomes after its divergence from cephalochordates, ~ <dig> mya . the second round is presumed to have occurred ~ <dig> mya, within the lineage leading to jawed vertebrates after the jawless line diverged, presumably before the split between cartilaginous and bony fish. despite this, all mammals studied thus far have retained only a single copy of the progranulin gene, whereas two rounds of genome duplication would theoretically create four progranulin genes. it is therefore interesting to consider the biological rationale behind retention of grna and grnb following the teleost genome duplication, an event not permitted within other vertebrates, in conjunction with the appearance of two extra paralogues, grn <dig> and grn <dig>  regulation by gene dosage through complementary transcription may have allowed for the retention of the smaller paralogues, while putative antisense transcription to grna may be necessary for precisely regulating the spatio-temporal activity of this growth factor.

overall, the expression patterns of zebrafish progranulins faithfully replicate those observed for the mouse counterpart in a similar context  <cit> . importantly, this indicates that the use of zebrafish will enable modeling of the contributions of progranulin activity to vertebrate development through investigating both grna and grnb. these studies will be uncomplicated by the presence of grn <dig> and grn <dig>  whose expression patterns largely do not overlap with the co-orthologues. overall, the expression patterns for the grns indicate that these growth factors may subserve multiple functions in vivo that are consistent with the known role of their mammalian counterpart in cell growth, motility and survival.

fish husbandry
wild type zebrafish were purchased from scientific hatcheries  and maintained on a  <dig> h/ <dig> h light/dark cycle at  <dig> °c in a laboratory aquarium . fish were fed twice daily, and bred as described elsewhere  <cit> . embryos for developmental studies were collected from tanks and staged according to conventional criteria  <cit>  and by hours post-fertilization .

library screening and cloning of zebrafish progranulins
the zebrafish grn <dig> cdna was cloned using a pcr strategy . the carp granulin- <dig> amino acid sequence was used to design degenerate forward df <dig>  and reverse dr <dig>  and dr <dig>  primers for use in the polymerase chain reaction . the template for the initial amplification reaction was a 5'-stretch plus cdna library cloned in lambda gt <dig> vector . cdna for this library was prepared from 1-month-old zebrafish using a combination of oligo-dt and random priming.  <dig>  μl of library  was used in a final reaction volume of  <dig> μl for each new amplification attempt. the annealing temperature was determined empirically in order to maximize yield of product. pcr amplifications were performed with taq dna polymerase, unless specified otherwise, using a hybaid thermal cycler from bio/can scientific inc. . amplified products were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified with the qiaquick gel extraction kit  and sequenced after cloning into topo pcr <dig>  . an initial reaction using the df <dig> and dr <dig> primer pair yielded several products.  <dig> μl of this reaction was subjected to re-amplification using df <dig> primer in combination with the nested  dr <dig> primer, which revealed a product of 126-bp encoding a partial sequence for granulin- <dig> . new grn <dig> primers f <dig>  and r <dig>  were then designed based on this sequence and were used, respectively, in combination with flanking gt <dig> primers in order to obtain the 5'- and 3'-untranslated region  cdna sequences . finally, the entire orf was amplified with pwo dna polymerase , using forward f <dig>  and reverse r   primers . this pcr was performed in a final volume of  <dig> μl, containing  <dig>  μl of library,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> % triton x- <dig>   <dig>  mm concentration of each dntp,  <dig>  unit of pwo dna polymerase, and  <dig> pmol of each primer. an initial denaturation step was carried out at 94°c for  <dig> min. annealing temperatures of 54°c, 56°c and 58°c were used sequentially for  <dig> cycles each. typical denaturation, annealing, and amplification reactions were carried out at 94°c for  <dig> sec, 54°c for  <dig> min, and 68°c for  <dig> min, respectively. a final extension step of  <dig> min at 72°c was carried out after adding  <dig>  unit taq dna polymerase. an amplification product specific for grn <dig> was sequenced on both strands. the 5'-utr, and a portion of the 3'-utr for grn <dig>  were amplified using grn1-specific primers in conjunction with a lambda gt <dig> primer. distinct cdnas encoding progranulin- <dig> and a chimeric progranulin were uncovered through this approach. each transcript was confirmed through sequencing of independent amplification reactions using template cdna derived from either adult organs or embryos of mixed stages. following a strategy similar to that used for the isolation of zebrafish grn <dig> cdna, primers based on the purified carp granulin-a peptide sequence were designed to clone partial cdnas for zebrafish grna and grnb, respectively . blast searches using the cloned sequences retrieved two unique ests at ncbi sharing an exact match with grna and grnb, respectively . these respective ests were purchased from rzpd gmbh  and sequenced on both strands to create a final assembly of the full-length cdnas encoding zebrafish progranulin-a and progranulin-b. in addition to our cloning strategy, the rapid amplification of cdna ends  was performed with the generacer kit  using total rna isolated from adult zebrafish intestine. for grn <dig> and grn <dig> transcripts, a reverse primer that corresponded to nucleotides 195– <dig> based on the cloned orf of both transcripts , was used to perform the 5' race, while a forward primer corresponding to nucleotides 1– <dig> of each transcript  was used to perform the race in the 3' direction. similarly a 5' utr sequence for grna was obtained using the map reverse primer . repeated race attempts in both directions for asgrna were unsuccessful.

cloning of the zebrafish grn <dig> gene
a zebrafish genomic library constructed in p <dig> artificial chromosome   <cit>  and represented on filters at high-density  was screened for the presence of the grn <dig> gene using standard procedures. the cdna bearing the grn <dig> orf was labeled with  dctp by random priming using the oligolabeling kit  for use as probe, and purified using a sephadex g- <dig> column . kodak x-omat ar film was used for autoradiography . three positive clones  were detected by autoradiography, and the first two were confirmed to carry at least part of the grn <dig> gene by pcr, using the f <dig>  and r <dig>  primer pair which does not discriminate between grn <dig> and grn <dig>  and sequencing. dna from a positive clone  was purified with the plasmid midi kit .  <dig>  μg of this dna was subjected to restriction digest with ecori to generate fragments suitable for cloning into pbluescript ii ks , and was followed by transformation in top 10f' electrocompetent cells . screening of colonies transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes , employing the same probe used for the original library screening, was performed in the following prehybridization and hybridization conditions:  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> % sds,  <dig> % na pyrophosphate at 65°c. membranes were washed twice in  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> % sds,  <dig> % na pyrophosphate at 60°c for  <dig> min, followed by two washes in  <dig> % ssc,  <dig> % sds,  <dig> % na pyrophosphate at 60°c for  <dig> min. plasmid dna from a positive clone was purified using the high pure plasmid isolation kit . an insert of ~9-kb was fully sequenced and revealed the presence of the promoter region and approximately half of the grn <dig> gene. the remaining gene sequence was found in a ~6-kb insert clone isolated by re-screening the colony lifts with 32p-labeled reverse r oligonucleotide  as probe. a pcr was performed using primers flanking this ecori site, and sequenced to confirm that the isolated  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb clones represent continuous sequences within the original pac clone.

retrieval of antisense transcripts from ncbi
while in the process of analyzing cloned grn <dig> genomic sequences  through blast searches for corresponding sequences at genbank, an est harbouring sequences corresponding to unspliced grn <dig>  but in the reverse complement orientation, was noticed. this clone  was purchased  and further analyzed through sequencing. a putative transcript exhibiting perfect complementarity to the 3'utr region of zebrafish grna  was deduced from sequencing four unidirectionally cloned ests deposited at genbank  that originated from an oligo-dt-primed cdna synthesis from adult kidney marrow rna . unidirectional cdna synthesis using total rna derived  <dig> day-old larvae was synthesized using a sense primer relative to the 3'utr exon  or to a known intron  of grna . these primers were then used in conjunction with the following primer  in subsequent rt-pcr to confirm antisense transcription to grna.

chromosomal assignment and syntenic analysis
zebrafish grns were mapped using the ln <dig> radiation hybrid panel as previously described  <cit> . primers for each gene are noted in additional file  <dig>  each pcr reaction was carried in a final volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> ng "hybrid dna",  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm each dntp,  <dig> unit taq dna polymerase, and  <dig> pmol of each oligo. denaturation, annealing and amplification were performed at 94°c for  <dig> sec, 55°c  or 60°c  for  <dig> sec, and 72°c for  <dig> sec, respectively, followed by an extension step of  <dig> min at 72°c. to determine syntenic relationships between zebrafish and human genomes, mapped zebrafish genes flanking a given zebrafish grn gene were identified using the consolidated zebrafish maps available from zfin  <cit>  and data from locuslink  <cit> .

gene expression profiling by rt-pcr
total rna from various adult tissues and developmental stages was isolated using trizol ls reagent , treated with dnasei and used in first strand synthesis using the revert aid h-synthesis kit . pcr conditions used for each family member consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min, followed by 30– <dig> cycles at 94°c for  <dig> sec, gene-specific annealing temperature  for  <dig> min and extension at 72°c for  <dig> min, with a final single cycle extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. to discriminate between grn <dig>  grn <dig> and hybrid grn, an 2so <dig> buffer with  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  was used for rt-pcr in conjunction with cloned template controls  for all three forms using the same reaction parameters. two independent reverse primers for grn <dig> and grn <dig> yielded products of expected size and hybrid grn was produced using grn <dig> forward with either of the grn <dig> reverse primers. all pcr products were resolved on 2% agarose gels, ethidium bromide stained and visualized on polaroid  <dig> film. the authenticity of all pcr products was confirmed by sequencing after cloning into topo/pcr <dig> .

northern blot analysis
full-length mrna transcript size was assessed for each progranulin family member by northern analysis of poly-a enriched mrna  purist small scale purification kit; ambion) derived from whole adult or  <dig> dpf animals  <cit> . hybridization  was carried out using non-radioactive biotin-labeled crna probes  and detected with brightstar biodetect nonisotopic detection kit  according to manufacturers instructions. band size was determined using pre-labeled biotin markers .

whole-mount mrna in situ hybridization
in situ hybridization for progranulin family gene expression was carried out essentially as previously described  <cit> . briefly, digoxigenin-labeled rna probes for each full-length cdna, with the exception of asgrn-1/ <dig> which corresponded to exons 1– <dig> only, were hybridized at 70°c using various developmental stages from cleavage to larval. in some cases, polyvinyl alcohol was added to the staining solution in order to minimize the occurrence of background, especially when the reaction was required to proceed for several days  <cit> . stained whole-mount and sectioned embryos were mounted in glycerol and visualized under a leica mzfliii stereomicroscope . pictures were taken with a leica dc350f camera and processed with adobe photoshop  <dig>  software.

northern analysis of zebrafish grn sense and antisense transcripts. northern blot analyses using strand-specific crna probes were performed to confirm the size of cloned cdna sequences and resolve the issue of antisense transcription to grna. panel a: grna is expressed as a predominant transcript of  <dig>  kb in size, consistent with cloned sequences , and can also be found as a larger transcript exceeding  <dig> kb. panel b: four grnb transcripts of approximately  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb in size, respectively, are detected. note that the  <dig>  kb band, showing strongest intensity, is in agreement with cloned sequences for this mrna . panel c: a riboprobe targeting asgrna detects a faint transcript of approximately  <dig> kb in size, suggesting that the cloned sequences for this antisense transcript  may represent a splice variant. panel d: the grn <dig> transcript is approximately  <dig>  kb in size, as expected from cloned sequences , but also expressed at lower levels as a larger transcript of approximately  <dig>  kb. panel e: unlike grn <dig>  grn <dig> is not expressed as a transcript other than  <dig>  kb in size. panel f: a band of low intensity can be detected at  <dig>  kb for the hybrid grn rna, suggesting that no cross-hybridization occurs with grn <dig> and grn <dig> mrnas using this riboprobe. the hybrid grn riboprobe also detects a band of approximately  <dig>  kb similar in intensity to that seen for grn <dig>  panel g: the overall abundance of the asgrn1- <dig> transcript is too low for detection. a–c:  <dig> μg poly-a enriched rna; d–g:  <dig> μg total rna, each derived from a whole adult.

partial characterization of a putative antisense transcript to zebrafish grna. panel a: schematic representation of the location of asgrna, a unidirectionally cloned transcript sharing complementarity with part of the last exon of the zebrafish grna gene. the relative position of primers used for cdna synthesis  and subsequent rt-pcr are indicated . panel b: rt-pcr analysis of cdna synthesized using either primer  <dig> or primer  <dig>  respectively, with  or without  reverse-transcriptase. primers depicted in a are used in the following combination for the rt-pcr: pair 1/ <dig>  and pair 1/ <dig> . the presence of an amplicon for both primer pairs using each +rt cdna template, but not using template derived from -rt reactions, indicates that asgrna extends in the 3'end direction and overlaps with intronic sequences of grna. positive controls for pcr conditions using genomic dna as template, as well as a no template control are indicated, respectively. the authenticity of the amplicons was determined through sequencing. each step of the experimental procedure was performed twice.
