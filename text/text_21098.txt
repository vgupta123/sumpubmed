BACKGROUND
thaxtomin a  is the major phytotoxin produced by pathogenic streptomyces spp. responsible for common scab, a globally important disease of potato  <cit> . ta inhibits cellulose biosynthesis in expanding plant tissues and its production is essential for disease induction  <cit> . based on similarity of symptoms produced, ta is believed to be closely related to other cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors  such as isoxaben  and dichlobenil   <cit> . the linkage of the modes of actions of these compounds has been confirmed with habituation studies to ta, revealing cross-resistance to both ixb and dcb  <cit> , although mechanisms of resistance were not investigated.

the cellular target of ta has not been identified  <cit> . this is in contrast to ixb, where mutant analyses have identified specific cellulose synthase  complexes  from the plasma membrane as toxin targets  <cit> . putative cellular targets for dcb have also been indirectly identified and include cesa <dig> or cesa <dig> and other regulatory proteins  <cit> . a recent study showing similar genes were upregulated following ta and ixb treatments of a. thaliana cells suggested a possible linkage in activity between these two cbi’s  <cit> . an initial interaction between ta and the plant cell membrane, resulting in ion flux signaling has been reported  <cit> , as has induction of programmed cell death  <cit> . however, little is known about the exact mechanism of cellular toxicity of ta. the txr <dig> gene is involved in a cellular transport system and mutations in this gene in arabidopsis thaliana txr1- <dig> lead to a decrease in toxin sensitivity, most likely due to reduced toxin uptake  <cit> .

in prior studies we have demonstrated an inverse association between ta toxicity and auxin or auxin-like compounds  <cit> . foliar treatment of potato plants with auxin and auxin-like compounds has been shown to suppress common scab development  <cit> . work in our laboratory has provided evidence that the mechanism of disease suppression is due to auxins inhibiting ta toxicity  <cit> . this and other electrophysiological data, whereby an auxin sensitive a. thaliana mutant  showed increased sensitivity to ta  <cit>  further support the link between auxin and ta toxicity. however, other researchers  <cit>  have questioned the direct causal relationship between ta and auxin itself as they noted very few auxin genes were upregulated in response to ta. thus, the interaction between auxin and ta remain elusive.

utilising cbi resistant a. thaliana mutants that are well characterized may provide an important resource for delineating and understanding disease resistance pathways and mechanisms of action and interactions  <cit> . in the case of ta, a resistant mutant txr1- <dig> has been described  <cit>  as has an ixb resistant mutant ixr1- <dig> <cit>  and a loss-of function mutant in genes required for cell wall synthesis korrigan   <cit> . these mutants and others may play a role in delineating similarities and differences in reaction to cbis and auxinic compounds and serve as useful tools in defining further interactions between ta and associated compounds.

in this work, we investigate the unique interaction of ta toxicity and its amelioration by auxin. we demonstrate that the interaction is not a direct effect of auxin per se, but is rather mediated through an interaction with polar auxin transport, associated with the npa binding protein of the efflux carrier. further, responses of key mutants indicate a probable commonality in mode of action of both ixb and ta, distinct from dcb which appears to be more distantly related.

RESULTS
mutant screening against various auxin sources
consistent with previous studies  <cit> , aux1- <dig> had enhanced resistance to both  <dig> -d  and iaa , but not to naa , when compared to rg <dig> value of the wt control . the ta resistant line txr1- <dig> , ixr1- <dig>  and kor <dig>  all showed sensitivity to all three auxins equivalent to the wt control .

mutants with altered response to auxin transport inhibitors
all three a. thaliana cbi mutants examined  showed enhanced root-based resistance to the auxin transport inhibitor, npa, in comparison to the wt . concentration levels of npa required to inhibit root growth by 50%  were approximately 13-fold ,  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  higher than the wt . the response of aux1- <dig> was no different to the wt . in contrast, all mutant lines and the wt control examined showed equivalent root growth suppression when treated with various concentrations of the auxin transport inhibitor, tiba .

root ion fluxes after pretreatment with auxin transport inhibitor, npa
no differences between a. thaliana genotypes were revealed in analyses of net h+ fluxes in the root elongation zone in response to npa; all plants showed net h+ uptake of  <dig> to 16 nmol m-2 s- <dig>  not significantly different to the untreated control . in the mature root zone, lower net h+ uptake  was recorded across all genotypes. in contrast to elongation zone, npa induced a significant reduction in net h+ uptake, in wt , but not in the cbi resistant mutants  .

mutants with differential response to cbis
root growth rates in the a. thaliana lines tested varied between  <dig> and 9 mm day- <dig>  under control conditions where no toxin was applied . root growth patterns in response to dcb were consistent across all five genotypes tested with rg <dig> values not significantly different compared to the control wt genotype .

in response to ixb, the three cbi mutants showed enhanced tolerance with aux1- <dig> responding no differently to the wt . the magnitude of enhanced tolerance varied with ixr1- <dig>  txr1- <dig> and kor <dig> having approximately 10-fold , 4-fold  and  <dig> -fold  greater tolerance respectively to ixb, than the wt.

root growth rates for each line decreased with increasing ta concentrations , with other typical symptoms including hypertrophy, necrosis and chlorosis  <cit>  also observed. as expected  <cit> , in the presence of ta, the txr1- <dig> mutant had a significantly greater root growth rate  than the wt . no other mutant had ta tolerance different to the wt  .

quantification of cbi levels in root tissue after cbi and npa treatment
consistent with previous studies  <cit> , txr1- <dig> was the only mutant to accumulate significantly  less ta than all other lines tested; with the addition of npa in combination with ta producing the same result . ixb quantification from the root tissue showed some variation although there were no significant differences produced across the lines tested with or without npa treatment. the line txr1- <dig> showed the lowest levels of detection .

1thaxtomin a and isoxaben levels from root tissue were quantified after 24 h on treatment media which contained either 1 μm thaxtomin a ± 3 μm npa; or 100 nm isoxaben ± 3 μm npa. results are the means ± se of three replicates.

discussion
the auxin: thaxtomin interaction - auxin may not be directly related with resistance to cbis
our previous studies with iaa and naa in a. thaliana <cit>  and with  <dig> -d in potato  <cit>  demonstrated a negative association between ta toxicity and auxin content of treatment medium or concentration within plant tissues. however, the specific nature of this association is not known. recent transcriptional profiling studies in response to both ta and ixb showed few auxin-responsive genes were upregulated by these cbis and the authors argued that these compounds do not act on auxin receptors  <cit> . additionally, errakhi and colleagues  <cit>  found that addition of iaa had no effect on ta induced electrophysiological h+ changes in arabidopsis, and suggested that ta and iaa do not interact at this level. supporting these findings we show that the root growth response of three cbi a. thaliana mutants  was not altered by any of the three auxins . this suggests that common mechanisms that confer resistance in these mutants: ixr1- <dig> - altered specific cellulose synthase  complexes  <cit> ; kor <dig> – cellulose deficiency  <cit> ; txr1- <dig> - altered cellulose synthesis activity  <cit> ; does not influence auxin uptake and associated root growth response, suggesting no direct cbi – auxin interaction.

linkage between auxin transport and resistance to cbis
whilst no direct cbi – auxin interaction could be identified in this study or by others  <cit>  duval and beaudoin  <cit>  found that the pinoid-binding protein  gene and the touch <dig> gene  that both bind to pinoid  were upregulated in response to both ixb and ta. pid is a protein kinase that acts as a positive regulator of auxin efflux polar transport  <cit> . whilst this suggested a link between inhibition of cellulose synthesis and auxin transport, more definitive proof was required  <cit> . our results presented here make use of a. thaliana mutants which provide an important resource for delineating and understanding disease resistance pathways and mechanisms of action  <cit> . in this case modifications in cellulose biosynthesis, expressed in a. thaliana mutants, provide a link between auxin transport and inhibition of cellulose synthesis.

differential response of a. thaliana cbi mutants to two key auxin transport inhibitors
the resistance of three mutants with altered cellulose synthesis properties  to npa implies a probable interaction between cellulose synthesis and this auxin transport efflux inhibitor. the specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by the finding that none of these mutants had an enhanced resistance to a second auxin efflux inhibitor, tiba, that has a cellular binding site distinct to npa  <cit> .

neither auxin efflux carrier sites nor the mode of action of inhibitors acting on these sites are fully understood  <cit>  with the complexities of auxin transport and carriers constantly evolving  <cit> . however, npa functions as a general inhibitor of secretory processes , associated with the auxin efflux carrier site  <cit> . tiba by contrast has its binding site directly associated with the auxin efflux carrier site  <cit>  distinct from the putative npa-binding protein  <cit> . it is important to note that auxin transport and binding studies indicate that all types of auxin transport inhibitors act at a site distinct from that of the auxin binding site on the efflux carrier, i.e. they are non-competitive with auxins  <cit> . taken together with the lack of any response to auxin source in all three cbi mutants, it suggests that these mutations associated with cellulose synthesis also invoke a modified response to specific compounds inhibiting polar auxin transport, i.e. npa, rather than auxin itself, and suggests that the cbi-auxin interaction may be linked to indirect processes associated with npa-specific binding to the auxin efflux carrier.

the npa resistance of the ixr1- <dig> and txr1- <dig> mutant in our study was  <dig> and  <dig> -fold greater than wild-type, respectively, but the nature of the npa resistance is unknown. the finding of npa resistance in these two cbi mutants has not previously been reported. these mutants represent a useful research tool in furthering the understanding of npa-binding  <cit> , cellulose biosynthesis and all its complexities.

it must be stated that the usage of npa in these studies does have some limitations. these include the fact that npa has a complex mode of action that is not specific for auxin transport but a general inhibitor of secretory processes  <cit> . additionally, npa may target different proteins and transporters at different concentrations  <cit> .

auxin transport inhibitor, npa affects ionic homeostasis in the mature but not elongation root zone
in the wt line, npa treatment effects on proton flux were observed in the mature but not the elongation root zone. the suppression of h+ fluxes in the mature root zone mirrors the root growth suppression patterns of the three genotypes studied. the reduction in h+ flux may be attributed to a cessation of normal growth type responses as occurs in response to a toxin  <cit>  or foreign compound  <cit> . that the major response occurred in the mature but not elongation zone was unexpected, given the well-established role of auxin in control over cell division in the root apex  <cit>  and indicates a different mode of action. it is possible that npa is partially suppressing the polar transport of endogenous auxin from the root apex into the mature zone, so affecting normal growth processes and flux dynamics in this mature region. in this assay, npa tolerance was again demonstrated in cbi resistant mutants ixr1- <dig> and txr1- <dig>  these results further support the link between inhibition of cellulose synthesis and the auxin efflux transport processes influenced by npa.

uptake of cbi’s not affected by npa presence
to determine a possible interaction between cbi and npa resistance the uptake of the two toxins, ta and ixb was monitored across the mutant lines. the conclusion from these quantitative assays was that npa did not affect cbi uptake suggesting no direct interaction between these compounds. it must be stated that this work is only preliminary in nature and that the presence of auxin compounds themselves may have a greater impact on cbi uptake as this has been previously demonstrated  <cit> , hence further investigation on cbi uptake with presence of auxin sources is warranted. nonetheless, the new methodologies presented here confirm previous findings that txr1- <dig> has an altered transport component that reduces ta uptake  <cit>  and therefore less compound accumulated in the root tissue.

mutants with differential responses to cbis
testing cbi a. thaliana mutants as presented here or in other plant cell systems such as habituated poplar cell suspensions with resistance to cbis  <cit>  can aid in identifying common mechanisms across toxins  <cit>  and similarities in resistance mechanisms of the mutants. better understanding of these complexities will enable a greater understanding of how plant cells respond to toxins and key information about cellulose synthesis  <cit> . indeed, similarity of responses expressed in this study particularly by txr1- <dig> and ixr1- <dig>  with enhanced multiple resistances to both ixb and npa suggests that ta and ixb share a common mode of action. it is known that txr1- <dig> lacks a txr <dig> gene product, with the product suspected to be involved in a transport system  <cit> . therefore, it is probable that both ixb and npa may utilise this transport system in some manner. in contrast, the ixr1- <dig> mutant, with an altered component of a cellulose synthase gene  <cit> , did not show resistance to ta. the lack of cross-resistance of ixr1- <dig> to ta, observed in this study suggests that this altered target enzyme is not a target of ta  <cit> .

ta is closely associated with ixb but more distantly with dcb
previous research indicated a commonality in mode of action between ta and ixb, with both inhibiting cellulose synthesis  <cit> , initiating a programmed cell death response  <cit>  and upregulating a similar set of genes when applied to a. thaliana suspension cells  <cit> . whilst we found that txr1- <dig>  ixr1- <dig> and kor <dig> had enhanced resistance to ixb and npa, none of these mutants had altered resistance to dcb. based on our complementary results from three different mutants it appears that ta is closely linked to ixb but more distantly related to dcb  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
whilst the mode of action and specific target of ta have not yet been identified  <cit>  data presented here are suggestive of a direct linkage between auxin efflux transport processes that may be inhibited by npa and inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis. the mife ion flux data highlights an important role of the mature root zone as yet another target for possible auxin-ta interaction and provides an electrophysiological insight into these unique cbi’s. the usage of well characterized arabidopsis mutants enabled associations between toxin mode of actions to be identified with ixb and ta linked, compared to the more distantly related cbi, dcb. further work in elucidating mechanisms is required but the identification of strong resistance to npa expressed by both ixr1- <dig> and txr1- <dig> makes these mutants a unique tool for further understanding auxin transport processes.
