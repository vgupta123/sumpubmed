BACKGROUND
the commensal human microbiome is estimated to outnumber the amount of human body cells by a factor of ten  <cit> . these complex microbial communities are normal residents of the skin, the oral cavity, vaginal and intestinal mucosa and carry a broad range of functions indispensable for the wellbeing of the host  <cit> . usually we only become aware of their presence when the balance between the microbiota and the host is lost, and disease is manifest. this is reflected in the ample knowledge on the human microbiome at the state of disease as opposed to the limited picture we have of the healthy microbiome. in order to diagnose and treat disease at an early and reversible stage one needs to describe the commensal microbiome associated with health. for example, understanding changes in the oral microbiome at the early stages of periodontitis and dental caries, the most prevalent chronic oral diseases, would allow diagnosis and treatment before the appearance of periodontal pockets or dental hard tissue loss.

recent advances in sequencing technology, such as  <dig> pyrosequencing provides hundreds of thousands of nucleotide sequences at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods  <cit> . this deep sequencing has revealed an unexpectedly high diversity of the human oral microbiome: dental plaque pooled from  <dig> healthy adults comprised about  <dig> microbial phylotypes  <cit> . this is an order of magnitude higher than previously reported  <dig> oral microbial phylotypes as identified by cultivation or traditional cloning and sequencing  <cit> . moreover, by pooling about  <dig> individual microbiomes and pyrosequencing these, the ecosystem still appeared undersampled: the ultimate diversity of the oral microbiome was estimated to be around  <dig> phylotypes  <cit> .

if "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects"  <cit> , then a healthy oral microbiome should be dominated by a "core microbiome" characteristic for health. these abundant phylotypes would maintain the functional stability and homeostasis necessary for a healthy ecosystem. to date though, there is no information available on how many of the  <dig> phylotypes  <cit>  actually contribute to a single oral cavity and how common or exclusive individual oral microbiomes of unrelated healthy individuals are.

the oral cavity differs from all other human microbial habitats by the simultaneous presence of two types of surfaces for microbial colonization: shedding  and solid surfaces . this intrinsic property of the oral cavity provides immense possibilities for a diverse range of microbiota. once the symbiotic balance between the host and the microbiota is lost, these microbiota may become involved in disease. for instance, the tongue, with its mucosal 'crypts' which allow anaerobic microbiota to flourish, is an established source of halitosis  <cit> . approximal  surfaces between adjacent teeth have limited access to fluorides and saliva, and therefore have a predilection for dental caries  <cit> . to gather as complete information as possible on the healthy oral microbiome, microbial samples should be obtained from various ecological niches throughout the oral cavity.

here we present the first description of diversity, uniqueness and the level of overlap of microbiomes of three healthy individual oral cavities at various intraoral niches  at the probing depth as provided by targeted pyrosequencing of the v5-v <dig> hypervariable region of the small subunit ribosomal rna.

RESULTS
the overall sequence data
in total,  <dig> reads passed the quality control filters. recent publications  <cit>  have identified the potential inflation of richness and diversity estimates caused by low-quality reads . reads with multiple errors can form new otus if they are more distant from their real source than the clustering width. these reads are relatively rare and most commonly occur as singletons or doubletons. to preclude the inclusion of sequencing artifacts or potential contaminants from sample processing, and to avoid diversity overestimation, we included only sequences occurring at least five times in further analyses. by doing so, we have also removed many less frequent but valid sequences representing the rare members of the microbiome.

the final data contained  <dig> reads and resulted in  <dig> unique sequences . the average length of sequence reads was  <dig> nt. the stringent selection of sequences  and individual labelling and sequencing of  <dig> samples on a single pyrosequencing plate have largely reduced the depth of pyrosequencing resolution. on average,  <dig> reads per sample were obtained instead of the  <dig> reads possible when using a full plate for a single sample. our findings on diversity, therefore, should be considered conservative.

a only reads that were observed five or more times were included in the analyses.

b sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units  at 3%, 6% or 10% genetic difference.

c higher taxa refers to genus or to a more inclusive taxon  when sequence could not be confidently classified to the genus level.

a - sum of all samples of three individuals; only sequences that were present at least  <dig> times are included

b - number of unique sequences that were common in all three microbiomes

c - number of all otus 

d - number of otus  that were common in all three microbiomes

clustering of the overall data in phylotypes
clustering the unique sequences into operational taxonomic units  at a 3% genetic distance resulted in  <dig> different otus . a 97% identity in 16s rrna gene sequences is commonly used to group "species-level" phylotypes  <cit> . a 3% variation within a short hypervariable region of the small subunit  rrna gene may not correlate exactly with a 3% variation along the entire ssu rrna gene. in fact, the correlation between genetic differences may well vary with different regions of the gene, and in different classes of organisms. however, most microbial diversity projects to date have used 3% otus  <cit> , and to be consistent with other research using pyrosequencing sequences we have chosen to use 3% otus as well. we have also clustered sequences into otus using more conservative genetic differences of 6% and 10% . in the further text however we refer only to otus at the 3% difference. these otus were grouped in  <dig> higher taxa  consisting of  <dig> genera and  <dig> more inclusive taxa , representing eight bacterial phyla .

the size of the otus  correlated significantly  with the number of unique sequences within an otu , i.e., the most abundant otus harboured the highest counts of unique sequences. an obvious outlier was one abundant otu , classified as fusobacterium which contained only three unique sequences. six other abundant otus  contained more than  <dig>  unique sequences each. four of these otus were assigned to the genus streptococcus , one to the genus corynebacterium , and one to the genus neisseria . two-thirds of all otus contained a single sequence; however these were low abundance otus , together contributing to just  <dig> % of all reads .

diversity and taxonomy of individual microbiomes
within an individual oral cavity, over  <dig> sequences comprising over  <dig> "species-level" phylotypes  and  <dig> -  <dig> higher taxa  were found . this richness is considerably higher than the  <dig> to  <dig> phylotypes and the  <dig> to  <dig> genera previously described using conventional cloning and sequencing  <cit> . the predominant taxa belonged to firmicutes , proteobacteria , actinobacteria , bacteroidetes  and fusobacteria  .

about  <dig> "species-level" phylotypes  belonged to abundant otus of the individual microbiome . a phylotype was considered abundant if it contributed to at least  <dig> % of the microbiome. these abundant phylotypes together contributed to  <dig> - 93% of each microbiome.

as with a pooled oral microbiome  <cit>  and individually sequenced gut microbiomes  <cit> , each individual oral microbiome in this study was dominated by a few sequences while most sequences were rare and contributed to the "long tail" effect .

overlap of three individual oral microbiomes
unique sequences
twenty-six percent  of the unique sequences were found in all three microbiomes and 65% in at least two microbiomes . of all reads, 66% belonged to sequences that were shared by three microbiomes . nine sequences were highly abundant  across all individuals: they contributed to 11%, 9% and 21% of the microbiome of individuals s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively . two of these sequences were assigned to the genus streptococcus, two to the family veillonellaceae, one each to the genera granulicatella , corynebacterium, rothia , porphyromonas  and fusobacterium .

on the other hand, 17-19% of the unique sequences originating from a single oral cavity were not shared with either of the other two microbiomes . combined, these "exclusive" sequences contributed to  <dig> - 20% of the total count of reads within an individual microbiome. within an individual, one to six "exclusive" sequences were highly abundant . sequencing of a larger number of individual microbiomes is necessary for assessing the true exclusivity of these abundant individual-specific sequences.

a - sequence was considered predominant if it contributed to at least  <dig> % of the individual microbiome

b - number of samples of the particular individual where the respective "exclusive" sequence was found

phylotypes
all three microbiomes shared  <dig>  of  <dig> otus . these overlapping phylotypes together contributed to  <dig> - 93% of each microbiome . fifty-one of these shared otus were abundant  and together occupied  <dig> - 73% of the individual microbiome .

sixty-nine,  <dig> and  <dig> otus originated from one particular microbiome and contributed to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the microbiome from individual s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively. interestingly, all unique otus from either s <dig> or s <dig> were present at low abundance, while in s <dig> four of  <dig> unique phylotypes were relatively abundant . one phylotype  contributed to  <dig> % of this microbiome and was preferentially found around the molar tooth  and in the sample obtained at the hard palate.

the otus representing different phyla were not equally shared among the individuals . the lowest similarity was observed in spirochaetes , followed by bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria , proteobacteria , actinobacteria , candidate division tm <dig> , firmicutes , while the highest similarity was found in fusobacteria . the low similarity among the otus of spirochaetes among the three microbiomes could be due to low abundance of this phylum in the different samples. since a high prevalence of spirochaetes in dental plaque is associated with periodontal disease  <cit> , it would be interesting to assess the degree of similarity and diversity of these phylotypes in a group of periodontitis patients.

higher taxa
at the higher taxonomic levels, 72% of all taxa  were shared by the three microbiomes, contributing to  <dig> % of all reads. only 2-11% of higher taxa were individual-specific . however, these taxa were found at a very low abundance  and most likely were not a part of the commensal oral flora, and should be regarded as "transients".

the observed overlap in taxa and in phylotypes is unexpectedly high and considerably higher than the recently reported average of 13% similarity in phylotypes between any two hands from unrelated individuals  <cit> . of even greater contrast to our findings are the comparisons of gut microbiomes which show no overlap in microbiota in unrelated individuals  <cit> . instead of a core microbiome at an organismal lineage level, gut microbiomes harboured distinct core genes  <cit> . the most probable explanation in the observed exclusiveness of gut microbiomes is the close interplay of intestinal microbiota with the host.

in the abovementioned study on hand surface microbiomes, only five phylotypes were shared across the  <dig> hands sampled  <cit> . human palms are continuously exposed to diverse biological and abiotic surfaces that may function as a microbial source, and furthermore, hands are regularly washed, allowing new communities of different origins to establish. this may explain the high diversity and relatively low overlap in hand palm communities. the situation is cardinally different in the oral cavity. even though dental hygiene procedures  effectively removes dental plaque, newly cleaned surfaces are continuously bathed in saliva. saliva functions here as a transport medium for microorganisms from sites that were not affected by cleansing . furthermore, the human mouth is a relatively stable ecosystem regarding temperature and saliva as a nutrient source. the contact of the oral cavity with external microbial sources is highest in the first years of human life  <cit> , and is mostly limited to microorganisms in food or drinking water at a later age.

sample-specific profiles within individual oral microbiomes
even at the phylum level, distinct differences among various intraoral sites were observed, e.g. firmicutes dominated the cheek mucosa of volunteers s <dig> and s <dig>  while the relatively minor phylum, candidate division tm <dig>  was overrepresented at the approximal sites of volunteer s <dig> and on incisor buccal and incisor approximal surfaces of volunteer s <dig> .

fifteen taxa were found at all sites in all three individuals: the
genera streptococcus, neisseria, corynebacterium, rothia, actinomyces, haemophilus, prevotella, fusobacterium, granulicatella, capnocytophaga, representatives of the veillonellaceae, neisseriaceae and pasteurellaceae families, the bacteroidales order and unclassified firmicutes. unclassified bacteria and an additional four taxa were found in all but one sample: genus porphyromonas, leptotrichia, tm <dig> genera incertae sedis and campylobacter .

as mentioned above , a few sequences dominated each individual microbiome. three of the sequences were found across all  <dig> samples that originated from three individuals: two veillonellaceae family members  and one fusobacterium genus member . this latter ubiquitous sequence accounted for 34% of fusobacterium reads and for 1% of the total reads . the latter finding is especially interesting in the light of the central role fusobacteria play in mediating coaggregation of non-aggregating microbiota and their importance as a structural component of both healthy and disease-associated dental plaque  <cit> .

within an individual oral cavity,  <dig> - 51% of the unique sequences were found solely in a single sample and mostly at a low abundance. about 600- <dig> sequences per individual were found only once. among these, numerous representatives of commensal oral microorganisms, as well as non-commensal microbiota, such as vibrio, salinivibrio and other gammaproteobacteria were present. even though these sequences were found as singletons in a particular microbiome, they had to be present at least five times across all three microbiomes according to the cut-off we applied.

not all sequences that were found at a single site were rare:  <dig> of the sample-specific sequences  were found at least  <dig> times  in a particular sample . surprisingly, all four abundant sample-specific sequences from volunteer s <dig>  and five of the ten abundant sample-specific sequences from volunteer s <dig>  were found solely in the saliva sample of the respective individuals. the relatively high abundance of these saliva-specific organisms suggests that they are a part of the commensal oral microbiota. the most likely source of these organisms is a niche that was not specifically sampled but was exposed to saliva, e.g., tonsils, back of the tongue or subgingival plaque. tonsils, for instance, have been shown to harbour a more diverse community than intraoral mucosal or dental sites  <cit> .

on average, each individual sample harboured  <dig> "species-level" phylotypes  . this is again considerably higher than the previously reported  <dig> -  <dig> species per site using traditional cloning and sequencing methods  <cit>  or  <dig> -  <dig> species using a 16s rrna gene-based microarray  <cit> .

a trend for a higher diversity was observed in the samples taken at the approximal surfaces and the lingual surface of the front teeth . the approximal surfaces, also known as plaque stagnations sites, are protected from regular toothbrushing. although volunteers were asked to brush their teeth  <dig> hr before the samples were collected, the use of interdental oral hygiene means such as floss or toothpicks was not controlled. it is likely that older and thus more diverse plaque  <cit>  was sampled at these sites. higher diversity of the plaque from the lingual surface of the front tooth but not that of the molar tooth suggests that the composition of plaque of the lingual surface of the front tooth might be influenced by the anatomy of this surface - a protruding rounded tubercle at the gingival third of the crown, near the gingival sulcus. the area near the sulcus, protected by the tubercle, may have provided a niche suitable for more diverse microorganisms than anatomically flat lingual surface of the molar.

the two cheek samples from individual s <dig> and individual s <dig> showed the lowest diversity among all samples . these samples were dominated by only two otus each, identified as streptococci, with  <dig> sequences comprising 13% of all reads in the sample from s <dig>  and  <dig> sequences comprising 17% of the reads in the cheek sample from s <dig>  the closest match to these otus was streptococcus mitis which is known to produce immunoglobulin a <dig> protease. this enzyme is important for the ability of bacteria to colonize mucosal membranes in the presence of s-iga antibodies in saliva  <cit>  and might explain high dominance of these phylotypes in these particular samples. notably, the cheek sample from s <dig> still contained one of the highest counts of taxa , but obviously at a very low abundance.

dimensional reduction of the otu data by principal component analysis  explained 51% of the total variance among the individual samples by the first three components . the greatest component  discriminated between the samples of dental and mucosal origin, especially in individuals s <dig> and s <dig>  the second greatest component  discriminated all samples of volunteer s <dig> from the samples of s <dig> and s <dig>  the third component  increased the separation of the samples of mucosal and dental origin, e.g. all three tongue samples aligning in the vicinity of each other , supporting the earlier findings that the tongue has a specific microbial profile  <cit> . since saliva is easily and non-invasively accessible it is a popular sample in oral epidemiology and microbiome diversity  <cit>  studies. in our study, the profiles of the saliva samples were closer to communities obtained from mucosal than dental sites, which is in line with the results of a large scale survey on  <dig> healthy subjects where  <dig> selected bacterial species were followed using dna-dna hybridization technique  <cit> .

in order to explore if the location in the oral cavity has an effect on the microbiota of the particular niche , we sampled two distant teeth - the front tooth and the first molar. no pattern could be found among the samples from individual s <dig>  however, both distantly situated lingual samples from individual s <dig> and s <dig>  as well as both approximal samples from individual s <dig>  showed higher similarity than the buccal samples of the respective individual . the differences in the intraoral conditions such as salivary flow, lip or cheek movement, chewing forces and food clearance, may have had a higher impact on buccal than lingual or approximal surfaces of the two regions of the oral cavity.

CONCLUSIONS
the major proportion of oral microbiomes was common across three unrelated healthy individuals, supporting the concept of a core-microbiome at health. the site specificity of the oral microbiome, especially between mucosal and dental sites and between saliva and dental sites, should be considered in future study designs. sequencing large sub-populations in longitudinal clinical trials at defined intermediate stages from health to disease will provide oral health professionals with valuable information for future diagnostic and treatment modalities.
