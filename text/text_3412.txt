BACKGROUND
candida albicans is a medically important fungal pathogen that exhibits various morphological forms: yeast, hypha, pseudohypha and chlamydospore. as a commensal, c. albicans colonizes human mucosae and is a component of the oral fungal microbiome  <cit> . its extraordinary ability to inhabit diverse niches of the human body is reflected in its adaptability to a wide range of ambient ph values and to changes in oxygen pressures, ion concentrations, and carbon sources  <cit> . as an external envelope endowed with mechanical strength, the cell wall plays a primary role in determining cell shape and in maintaining cell integrity during morphological changes or osmotic shock. additionally, the surface of the cell wall is positioned at the interface between the pathogen and host cells and thus mediates dynamic interactions crucial for pathogenesis. whereas the yeast form is suitable for dissemination through the blood stream, the thin filamentous shape of hyphae is specialized for adhesion to epithelial and endothelial barriers, and penetration and invasion of the tissues below  <cit> . genomic-scale expression studies have identified a number of signature genes induced by the yeast to hypha  transition .

hypha formation requires a coupling between the polarity machinery and the biogenesis of the wall in order to drive growth at the tip of the germ tube. cell wall formation requires synthesis and assembly of two glucose polymers, β-glucan, the most abundant, and β-glucan, and synthesis and incorporation of mannoproteins. most mannoproteins are modified by attachment of glycosylphosphatidylinositol  and are localized in the plasma membrane but can be further processed and covalently linked to cell wall glucan . chitin is a minor constituent but it is crucial for the formation of the septum and for the structural integrity of the wall. in the extracellular compartment, a branched βglucan-chitin core structure is created and decorated by links between chitin and β-glucan or trimmed gpi-mannoproteins, the latter forming the “brush-like” surface layer which functions as a permeability barrier and adhesive surface  <cit> .

among the extracellular enzymes orchestrating cell wall assembly, β-glucanosyltransferases of family gh <dig> play a primary role. these enzymes internally cleave a donor glucan chain and attach a portion of the donor to an acceptor glucan in β-linkage, thus lengthening one chain at the expense of the other  <cit> . multigene families encoding redundant enzymes are present in all fungal species so far analyzed and are essential for viability in many species . c. albicans has a family of five gh72-encoding genes: phr <dig>  phr <dig>  phr <dig>  pga <dig> and pga <dig>  phr1p and phr2p are highly similar to saccharomyces cerevisiae gas1p, they share the same activity in vitro and phr <dig> complements gas1Δ mutation  <cit> . pga4p is most similar to the paralog of scgas1p, the auxiliary scgas5p, and was previously detected in proteomic analysis of c. albicans cells  <cit> . since pga <dig> is transiently up-regulated in infection models and its deletion does not convey any obvious phenotype, it has been suggested that it may have some subtle roles in specific conditions  <cit> . recent evidence from our laboratories indicate that pga4p is an inactive enzyme and ectopic expression of pga <dig> is unable to complement gas1Δ mutation in s. cerevisiae . phr3p and pga5p are homologous to the sporulation-specific scgas4p and scgas2p, respectively  <cit> . the significance and the role of phr <dig> and pga <dig> are still unknown but the transcript level of both is very low or undetectable  <cit> . thus, phr1p and phr2p appear to be the only active β-glucanosyltransferases in c. albicans.

the expression of phr <dig> and phr <dig> is regulated in response to ambient ph. phr <dig> is expressed when the external ph is higher than  <dig> both in yeast and hyphal cells. it is repressed in acidic conditions where it is replaced by phr <dig> which exhibits the opposite expression pattern  <cit> . accordingly, the ph optima of recombinant phr1p and phr2p are consistent with their pattern of expression  <cit> . phr <dig> is also transcriptionally induced in response to heat stress, to treatments with the antifungal drug caspofungin and during infection . consistent with its enzymatic activity, phr1p localizes to sites of cell wall formation such as the site of bud emergence, the periphery of the bud, the septum, the tip of the germ tube, and the hyphal apex and septa  <cit> . at the septum, phr1p may convert polydisperse glucan to high molecular weight as shown for scgas1p at the mother-bud neck  <cit> . at ph  <dig>  and 25 °c, loss of phr1p affects cell wall composition, with a reduction of β-glucan content, an increase of chitin and a loss of cell wall compactness  <cit> . the phenotype is more severe if the ph is raised from  <dig>  to  <dig>  where greatly enlarged vacuoles and a rounder cell shape are present  <cit> . moreover, phr <dig> null mutants are avirulent in an animal model of systemic infection and in a model of experimental keratomycosis  <cit> . a phr <dig> null mutant is unable to invade in vitro reconstituted epithelia and has a reduction in adhesion, two fundamental processes for the establishment of fungal infections  <cit> .

by exploiting the ph-conditional nature of the phr <dig> null mutant, which manifests its defects in wall assembly only upon a shift to neutral-alkaline ph, we monitored the severity of the hyphal wall stress  response and analyzed the impact of defective glucan remodeling on the transcription profile during the induction of hyphal growth. among the classes of transcriptionally induced genes, we experimentally explored the physiological relevance of chs <dig> and chs <dig> and tested the effect of dna replication genes on entry in s-phase. the results underline the striking capability of c. albicans to adjust its physiological systems to generate an optimized adaptive response and the unanticipated relevant role of chs <dig> in protecting cells from lysis beside the compensatory function of chs <dig> that is common to many fungal species.

RESULTS
time-course microarray analysis upon induction of hyphal growth in wild type and phr <dig> null mutant
to induce hyphal growth, a ph/temperature regimen was used. blastospores of the wild type strain  and phr1Δ mutant  were transferred to buffered m <dig>  ph  <dig>  at 37 °c. in accord with the stronger morphological defect at ph  <dig>  the percentage of dead phr1Δ cells at 5 h, measured by methylene blue  staining, was 15 % compared to about 5 % at ph  <dig>  and therefore the latter condition was used for microarray analysis. phr1p was absent in blastospores at the moment of the shift to ph  <dig>  and accumulated in cai <dig> cells as a glycosylated 88 kda-polypeptide that was absent in cas <dig>  as expected   <cit> . cells started to form germ tubes at 45 min and the percentage of germ tubes increased with time reaching 50 % at 1 h and 80-90 % by 3 h after the shift. as shown in fig. 1b, at time zero the morphology of cai <dig> and cas <dig> was indistinguishable. at subsequent time points, cai <dig> produced elongated hyphae whereas cas <dig> germ tubes remained short and enlarged, with wide septa and with swollen apical compartments. at time zero, the two strains had the same chitin content  supporting the observation that phr <dig> deletion does not confer a detectable phenotype in non-inducing conditions. after 5 hours, chitin level increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  glcnac/mg d.w. of cells in cai <dig>  in agreement with the known accumulation of chitin in hyphae although the increase was less than that seen during serum induction. chitin accumulation was greater in cas <dig> cells,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  glcnac/mg d.w. of cells. this ~ 40 % extra chitin could be ascribed to the presence of hyphal wall stress  caused by the lack of phr1p activity.fig.  <dig> lack of phr1p affects morphology and constitutively activates map kinase signaling pathways during induction of hyphal growth in c. albicans. a western blot analysis of phr1p accumulation. at time zero, blastospores of the wild type  were shifted to m199-150 mm hepes buffered at ph  <dig>  at 37 °c. total protein extracts  were analyzed using cross-reacting anti-scgas1p antibodies and anti-actin mab. the extract from phr1Δ  corresponds to 5 h after the shift and shows the absence of phr1p. b morphology of the indicated strains during induction of hyphal growth. c activation of the map kinases mkc1p and cek1p during induction of hyphal growth. western blot analysis was performed as described in methods. mkc1p and cek1p migrated as bands of ~ 59 kda and 48 kda respectively. their identity was confirmed using mkc <dig> and cek <dig> null mutants . d activation of hog1p during induction of hyphal growth. sample “c” represents a control of an extract from vegetative cai <dig> cells exposed for 2 min to hyperosmotic shock 



to assess the onset of hws, we monitored the dual phosphorylation of mkc1p and cek1p, the two map kinases that become activated upon treatment with cell wall perturbing agents and have been implicated in morphogenesis , in the y-h transition , invasive growth, cell wall biogenesis and virulence . as shown in fig. 1c, phosphorylation of the two kinases in wild type cells was detected at 1 h and then steadily decreased indicating that hws was transient and hyphal wall integrity was rapidly restored. in contrast, in the mutant activation of both kinases was stronger and persisted for several hours. we also monitored the evolutionarily-conserved hog1p map kinase, which is involved in cell wall remodeling in response to hyperosmotic and oxidative stresses  <cit> . interestingly, in the wild type the phosphorylated form of hog1p was detectable from 2 hours to 5 h with a peak at 3 h . in contrast, in the phr <dig> mutant hog1p activation occurred earlier, by 1 h, and progressively increased at subsequent time points . the constitutive activation of mkc1p, cek1p and hog1p kinases indicates that phr1Δ mutant is subjected to severe hws. interestingly, a series of other experiments indicated that hog1p phosphorylation in the wild type has an oscillatory behavior, but this aspect was not further investigated in this work .

to characterize the pattern of gene expression during hyphal development we performed dna microarray analysis of strains cai <dig> and cas <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and 5 h. principal component analysis showed a clear separation between the wild type and mutant strains at each time point and underlined the high reproducibility of the biological replicas . moreover, hierarchical clustering indicated that for both strains changes at 3 h and 5 h clustered tighter than at 1 h . additional file  <dig> shows genes that were up-  or down–regulated  with a false discovery rate  ≤  <dig>  both in the wild type and mutant strains. this threshold was chosen to ensure that the analysis was stringent but would not miss significant genes. among the  <dig>  probes,  <dig> genes were up-regulated at 1 h,  <dig> at 3 h and  <dig> at 5 h in the wild type whereas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated in the phr1Δ mutant. moreover,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were down regulated at least 2-fold in the wild type and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in the mutant. comparison of the data from wild type and mutant strains identified a common group of responsive genes , suggesting that phr1Δ mutant cells trigger the hyphal expression program in spite of their failure to form hyphae.fig.  <dig> global comparison of the transcriptional profile of wild type and phr1Δ cells during induction of hyphal growth. a principal component analysis. each of the four blocks for each strain represents one of the sets of hybridization results. the median of ratios was used. , cai 10;  cas <dig>  b hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression. the dendogram plot, illustrated a portion of the complete analysis, is shown. c expression levels of the indicated genes determined by qrt-pcr. the data of each strain were normalized to time zero, set equal to  <dig>  data are mean values and bars indicate the standard deviations of three replicates of the same rna . similar results were obtained in two independent biological replicates



the modulation of many genes reflects the extensive differentiation associated with induction of the hyphal program and, at least in the early stages, the shift from quiescence to growth and the change in culture conditions . up-regulated genes belonged to the functional categories expected for hyphal development: hyphal growth, pathogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum -golgi transport, cell wall organization, golgi-er retrograde transport, er-associated-protein degradation  and biofilm formation. the typical signature up-regulated genes of hyphal growth, such as ece <dig>  sod <dig>  als <dig>  rbt <dig>  hwp <dig>  hyr <dig> pra <dig>  sap <dig>  sap <dig>  sap <dig> and the typical down-regulated genes rhd <dig>  tye <dig>  nrg <dig> were present  <cit> . phr <dig> itself is typically induced during hyphal growth and was up-regulated  <dig> -fold at 1 h and  <dig> -fold at 5 h in the wild type, in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . as expected, phr <dig> mrna was undetectable in cas <dig>  phr <dig> was repressed both in the wild type and in the mutant .

global transcriptional response to hws
to analyze the changes in gene expression caused by hws, we used a relation factor  representing the ratio between the expression ratio of each gene in the mutant and in the wild type . thus, rf reflects the effect of the phr1Δ mutation on the abundance of a transcript. we set a threshold of rf ≥  <dig> to identify transcripts more abundant in the phr1Δ mutant than in the wild type  and rf ≤  <dig>  for transcripts reduced in the phr1Δ mutant compared to the wild type . genes yielding a rf ≥  <dig>  but down-regulated both in the mutant and wild type, were not included in class  <dig>  similarly, genes with rf ≤  <dig>  but up-regulated in both strains, were not included in class  <dig>  in total, class  <dig> and class  <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> genes with known functions, and  <dig> and  <dig> genes with unknown functions, respectively .

table  <dig> summarizes the functional categories of mutation-sensitive genes. notably, in class  <dig> the most abundant categories were “cell wall” and “metabolism”, indicating the cell’s need of reorganizing the cell surface and redirecting metabolism. the categories “dna replication and repair”, “chromatin and chromosomes” and “cell cycle” were also affected, suggesting perturbations of the coordination between cell cycle events and morphogenesis. class  <dig> contained many genes required for rna processing and ribosome biogenesis primarily at 1 h.table  <dig> functional categories and number of phr1Δ mutation-sensitive genes in class <dig> and class 2



transcript levels and rf values of selected genes were confirmed by quantitative real time pcr  .

class  <dig> and class  <dig> genes uncover extensive rearrangement of the cell surface in response to hws
to make the analysis more stringent for genes specifically expressed in response to hws, we defined class  <dig> genes as those that were up-regulated at least two-fold in the mutant  with an rf ≥ <dig> . these genes were less induced , unchanged  or repressed  in the wild type  and are represented in table  <dig> by the red/red, red/white or red/green ratio respectively. the number of genes was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and 5 hours of hyphal development, respectively. as shown in table  <dig>  the “cell wall” category was among the largest and comprised:  five cell wall structural mannoproteins  found only in c. albicans or candida spp.,  three cell wall proteins that have homologs in s. cerevisiae ,  tos <dig>  plb <dig> and exg <dig>  enzymes that act on glucans or lipids ,  crh <dig>  encoding a glucan cross-linking enzyme of family gh <dig> and  chs <dig> and chs <dig>  encoding two of the four isoenzymes of chitin synthase . moreover, the transcript of chs <dig>  encoding a dedicated chaperone for chs3p export from the er  was also more abundant in the mutant at 5 h.table  <dig> selected class  <dig> genes ordered into different biological processes

the data refer to class  <dig> genes showing statistically significant rf . only genes that were upregulated respect to time zero by two-fold in the mutant  are shown. the genes were further colour-labelled according to their expression pattern: r/g , r/w , r/r . only genes with known function or participation to a biological process are listed. athis gene has two names: cwh <dig> and cax4




in addition, cwh <dig>  encoding an er-localized enzyme required for protein n-glycosylation  and flc <dig>  encoding a putative calcium transport, were two interesting genes with a red/white pattern. in particular, flc <dig>  was present at all the time points strongly suggesting that its function could be important for adaptation to hws. the flc proteins were initially proposed to be putative carriers for fad entry into the er  <cit>  but recent findings suggest that they are involved in calcium signaling and in hypotonic shock response  <cit> . other functional categories included “filamentous growth” with the presence of several fgr genes, “stress response” , “cell cycle”, “dna replication and repair” and “chromatin and chromosome”. notably, the genes induced in the mutant but repressed in the wild type, , included the “cell wall” genes pga <dig>  orf <dig> , rbr <dig>  rbt <dig>  the “stress response” gene ddr <dig>  the “metabolism” gene rta <dig>  and the g <dig> cyclins pcl <dig>  pcl <dig> and ccn <dig>  which points to a core hws response that primarily affects cell wall and cell cycle progression.

genetic interactions of phr <dig> and chsx genes during hyphal development
transcriptional data  suggested that the absence of phr <dig> forces multiple adjustments in the cell’s chitin synthesis: chs <dig>  chs <dig> and chs <dig> have rf > <dig>  despite it being well known that chitin plays an important compensatory role in protecting damaged fungal wall from lysis, studies in c. albicans have been primarily performed in unbuffered ypd. here, we analyzed the role of chitin synthases in the hws response. chs <dig> is an essential gene required for septum formation and for cell wall integrity. chs <dig> is preferentially expressed in hyphae where it contributes to overall chitin synthesis as well as septum formation. chs <dig> is responsible for the synthesis of a particular type of long fibrillar chitin at the septum . chs <dig> contributes the majority of cell wall chitin, which is deposited in the septal ring and lateral walls, of yeast and hyphae  <cit> . moreover, chs <dig> is responsible for calcofluor white /cacl <dig> induced chitin accumulation which protects c. albicans from the lethal effect of echinocandin  <cit> . chs <dig>  chs <dig> and chs <dig> are also responsible for the remedial septum that is synthesized when chs1p is inhibited, an indication of cross compensation  <cit> .

a phr <dig> homozygous null mutation was introduced into strains lacking chs <dig>  chs <dig>  chs <dig> and both chs <dig> and chs <dig> and analyzed during the induction of hyphal growth. at 5 hours after the shift, all chsxΔ mutants had formed hyphae but they were altered in morphology and were highly flocculant . hyphae of chs2Δ and chs8Δ mutants were larger in diameter and hyper-branched. these traits were accentuated in the double mutant chs2Δ chs8Δ cells. cw-staining, specific for chitin, was comparable to the wild type strain except for chs3Δ cells that were cw-positive only at the thin line of the septa, an observation in agreement with chs3p being responsible for the deposition of the majority of chitin located in the lateral wall and chitin ring but not in the chitin disk of the primary septum  <cit> . as shown in fig. 3a , cw-fluorescence of the phr1Δ mutant was distinctly more intense than in the control strain distributed over the wall and septa. deletion of phr <dig> conferred the same morphological defects to the chsxΔ mutants as seen with phr <dig> deletion alone but cells were more aggregated and phr1Δ chs3Δ cells arrested earlier. unexpectedly, the phr1Δ chs3Δ mutant stained with similar intensity and distribution as the phr1Δ mutant and also showed cells in which the dye had penetrated inside, an index of increased susceptibility to lysis, suggesting cell lysis was occurring . conversely, combined deletion of phr <dig> and either chs <dig> or chs <dig> resulted in reduced cw-staining, whereas the simultaneous absence of both enhanced cw staining.fig.  <dig> effects of deletion of chs <dig>  chs <dig>  chs <dig> or chs <dig> and chs <dig> on the phr <dig> null mutant phenotype. a

additionally, we measured the chitin content of the cells. as shown in fig. 3b, the deletion of chs <dig> in a wild type background dramatically reduced the chitin content of the cells and remained largely unchanged during the induction of hyphal growth. loss of either chs <dig> or chs <dig>  alone or in combination, resulted in a small reduction in chitin content compared to the wild type. in contrast, the chitin increase observed in the phr1Δ mutant was reduced in the absence of chs <dig> or either of chs <dig> or chs <dig>  unexpectedly, an increased chitin content was restored in the phr1Δ chs2Δ chs8Δ suggesting that the combined loss of chs <dig> and chs <dig> generates further stress that is compensated by the other isoenzymes. in addition, the chitin content of phr1Δ chs3Δ cells progressively increased during blastospore germination despite the aberrant appearance of the cells.

microscopic examination of the phr1Δ chs3Δ mutant after 24 h incubation revealed swollen, lysed cells and ghosts of cells into which cw had penetrated . this prompted an examination of the viability of the various mutants using mb staining. a weak lysis defect for the hyphae of the parental strains was detected especially for the chs3Δ mutant . only a few percent of phr1Δ cells were inviable at 5 h and this increased to around 15 % at 24 h, whereas 20 % of the phr1Δ chs3Δ cells were dead within 5 h and this increased to about 40 % by 24 h . when the phr1Δ mutation was combined with deletions of chs <dig> and/or chs <dig> no relevant effect on viability was observed after 24 h . at ph  <dig>  the percentage of dead phr1Δ chs3Δ cells increased to 70 % whereas the other strains remain similar to phr1Δ . in conclusion, chs3p is required for a sustained hws response in liquid m199-ph  <dig>  at 37 °c.

interestingly, chs2p and chs8p appear to contribute to the synthesis of chitin during the initial 5 hours of hyphal development. however, increased chitin content per se does not provide cell wall integrity in the absence of phr1p. the phr1Δ chs3Δ mutant accumulates chitin but partially fails to maintain cell integrity.

to assess which isoenzyme/s contributes to chitin synthesis when chs <dig>  chs <dig> and chs <dig> are missing, we tested by microdilution assay the sensitivity of the strains to ro-09- <dig>  a specific inhibitor of chs1p at inoculum size of  <dig> x  <dig> cells/ml  <cit> . the absence of visible growth of the phr1Δ chs3Δ mutant precluded testing the inhibitor against this strain. interestingly, phr1Δ and phr1Δ chs2Δ chs8Δ mutants exhibit similar sensitivity to the drug but both were more susceptible than the parental strains. this result indicates that chs1p contributes to the growth of both mutants . we also examined the lysis phenotype by mb staining at two different drug concentrations. phr1Δ and phr1Δ chs2Δ chs8Δ mutants were more prone to lysis compared to their parental strains . at the highest concentrations of inhibitor all strains were mostly lysed in accord with the essential role of chs1p. these results suggest that chs1p is required for growth in phr1Δ cells but the additional absence of chs <dig> and chs <dig> does not further affect the phenotype.fig.  <dig> relative increased susceptibility to chs1p inhibition of phr1Δ and phr1Δ chs2Δ chs8Δ mutants. the mutants cas <dig>  and fp <dig>  and their parental strains cai <dig>  and ngy <dig>  were analyzed for sensitivity to ro-09- <dig> by microdilution assay in m199-ph  <dig>  37 °c, at an inoculum size of  <dig> x 105/ml. data refer to 24 h. the results derive from  <dig> biological replicates and  <dig> microtiter plates for each replicate. data are relative to untreated wild type which was set to 100 % . the mb staining of cells from a representative experiment is shown in additional file 5




chs3p and chs8p are essential for germination and growth of phr1Δ cells on solid filamentation media
because some mutations differentially influence filamentation in broth culture versus solid media, we also tested the phenotype of the mutants on agar solidified media using the nutrient-rich m <dig> medium and an alternative medium . in both conditions, the parental strains formed filaments whereas the mutants containing a phr1Δ mutation were unable to filament, as observed in broth culture.

after 24 hours on solid m199-ph  <dig>  at 37 °c, all the strains gave rise to visible colonies except the phr1Δ chs3Δ mutant . upon microscopic observation of the agar surface, we concluded that phr1Δ chs3Δ cells did not germinate indicating that cell death is an early event. inclusion of  <dig>  m sorbitol in the plates did not suppress the lethal phenotype . the inability to germinate of the phr1Δ chs3Δ mutant was suppressed at ph  <dig>  confirming the association of the synthetic lethal phenotype with the presence of the phr <dig> deletion .fig.  <dig> genetic interactions of chs <dig>  chs <dig>  chs <dig>  chs2/chs <dig> and phr <dig> during filamentation on solid m <dig> at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  blastospores were plated as single cells on solid m199-150 mm hepes buffered at the indicated ph supplemented with uridine 100 μg/ml, and incubated at 37 °c . a colonies produced after 24 hours of incubation at ph  <dig>  b inclusion of sorbitol as an osmotic stabilizer does not suppress lethality of phr1Δ chs3Δ  whereas the double mutant exhibits normal growth at ph  <dig> , a permissive ph . c colonies produced on solid m199-150 mm hepes ph  <dig> incubated for 3 days at 37 °c . d microscopic morphology of cells taken from the indicated colonies on plate at ph  <dig>  the scale bar is 20 μm



on m199-ph  <dig>  germination was delayed relative to ph  <dig> , for the parental strains and further delayed in mutants harboring the phr1Δ mutation, in agreement with the more restrictive ph. after 3 days, as expected, phr1Δ chs3Δ cells did not grow, but surprisingly the phr1Δ chs8Δ mutant also failed to produce visible colonies . in contrast, phr1Δ chs2Δ mutants did form small colonies. the triple phr1Δ chs2Δ chs8Δ mutant gave rise to hardly visible microcolonies and cells taken from these colonies were swollen round and abnormally big, indicating a more severe morphological phenotype compared to phr1Δ or phr1Δ chs2Δ . upon microscopic observation of the agar surface, phr1Δ chs8Δ colonies appeared as small aborted colonies indicating that they germinated but died before producing a visible colony . the phenotype of the phr1Δ chs8Δ cells and of the phr1Δ chs2Δ chs8Δ strain was not sorbitol-remediable . therefore on m <dig>  chs <dig> is essential for germination of phr1Δ cells at restrictive ph. chs <dig> is essential both alone or combined with chs <dig>  for maintaining growth and viability of the germinated phr1Δ cells, but only at ph  <dig> 

since solid spider medium has a ph around  <dig>  it was supplemented with 150 mm hepes and buffered at the desired ph in order to test the phenotype of the mutants. after 7 days on spider-ph  <dig>  at 37 °c, all the strains generated colonies . at ph  <dig>  the phr1Δ mutant gave rise to small colonies, whereas the phr1Δ chs3Δ mutant did not produce colonies. this lethal phenotype was not sorbitol-remediable . moreover, the phr1Δ chs8Δ double mutant produced either no or less than  <dig> visible colonies per plate . the inclusion of sorbitol in the plates partially meliorated the phenotype as more small colonies were produced . microscopic examination of cells taken from the colonies on spider-ph  <dig> evidenced the presence of lysed cells and cell ghosts in the few visible colonies of phr1Δ chs8Δ, suggesting that extensive lysis occurred after germination . in contrast, the morphology of phr1Δ chs2Δ and phr1Δ chs2Δ chs8Δ cells was similar to phr1Δ cells except that chsΔ derived cells were more aggregated . thus, a partial attenuation of the phenotype occurred when both chs <dig> and chs <dig> were absent.fig.  <dig> genetic interactions of chs <dig>  chs <dig>  chs <dig>  chs2/chs <dig> and phr <dig> during filamentation on spider ph  <dig> at 37 °c. blastospores were plated as single cells on solid spider-150 mm hepes buffered at ph  <dig> . a colonies photographed after 7 days of growth at 37 ° c. the scale bar is 2 mm. b microscopic morphology of cells taken from the colonies. the scale bar is 40 μm



in conclusion, the phenotype of phr1Δ chsxΔ mutants in solid medium is influenced by the composition of the medium and by ph, which affects the severity of the stress. the results indicate a unique and essential role of chs <dig> and chs <dig> for phr1Δ viability in solid media .

the block of hyphae elongation up-regulates dna replication genes and accelerates progression into the dna division cycle
next, we investigated the class  <dig> genes related to “dna replication and repair”  and “chromatin and chromosomes”  . this transcriptional response occurred at  <dig> and 3 h and may be related to the block of hyphal elongation. however, the actual effect of these changes on entry into s-phase has not been reported. therefore, we analyzed by flow cytometry the dna distribution profile of wild type and phr1Δ mutant strains undergoing the y-h transition. blastospores after prolonged incubation in stationary phase  showed a very high degree of synchrony in germ tube formation when inoculated into hyphal induction conditions . the percentage of germ tubes was about 88 % for both the wild type and phr1Δ mutant at 1 h. by  <dig>  h, thin hyphae already appeared in the wild type whereas the germ tubes of the mutant developed a swollen apex. at this time, phr1Δ cells have already entered s-phase, earlier than control cells, and also an enrichment of cells at g2/m was observed . these results are in agreement with the early induction of dna replication genes in the mutant.fig.  <dig> cytofluorimetric analysis of dna distribution. cells were analyzed after induction of hyphal growth at 37 °c in m <dig> buffered at ph  <dig> . 1c and 2c indicate the relative dna content



discussion
the present study describes the impact of the loss of β-glucan assembly on the transcriptional program of c. albicans cells undergoing hyphal development. cells lacking the β-glucan transferase activity of phr1p were also the object of further genetic and functional studies to test the physiological relevance of the observed increase of chs <dig> and chs <dig> transcript levels. to our knowledge this is the first report in which the stress generated by defective hyphal wall assembly was analyzed by a large-scale approach and the stress was not imposed by use of inhibitors or temperature.

glucan remodeling and hyphal wall integrity
first, our results indicate that cells deficient in β-glucan remodeling activate the hyphal transcriptional program as shown not only by the ability to initiate germ tube formation but also by the induction of typical hyphal-induced genes. secondly, none of the phr genes  were identified in our analysis indicating that no transcriptionally-mediated cross compensatory mechanism exists between these paralogs and phr <dig>  the hyphal wall defects triggered a complex hws response whose main elements are here summarized.

a core set of eight mannoproteins responds to the loss of β-glucan assembly
among the genes encoding cell wall proteins that were up-regulated in the phr1Δ mutant we identified five candida-specific cell wall structural mannoproteins . we included the uncharacterized orf <dig>  since the predicted polypeptide has features in common with surface mannoproteins: the presence of a signal peptide, abundance of alanine, serine and threonine residues, a hydrophobicity plot similar to that of ece1p and the presence of internal repeats. furthermore, the recombinant protein was also shown to be a substrate in vitro of the kex <dig> protease  <cit> . three other cell wall proteins  have homologs in s. cerevisiae and have been partially characterized  <cit> . pga <dig> is the ortholog of ccw <dig>  a s. cerevisiae gene encoding a covalently-linked cell wall mannoprotein required for cell wall integrity  <cit> . interestingly, pga <dig> encodes a mannoprotein that influences surface properties and its deletion increases adhesion of cells to plastic  <cit> . we postulate that consequently enhanced transcription of pga <dig> in the phr1Δ mutant may result in reduced adhesion. pga <dig> up-regulation, combined with the observed down-regulation of als <dig>  als <dig> and pga <dig>  may explain the reduced adhesion to plastic and cell monolayers we previously described for phr1Δ cells  <cit> . as mannoproteins are an abundant constituent of the cell wall, altogether this response suggests a revamping and the reinforcement of the extracellular matrix during hws.

the increase of cwh <dig> transcript level at 5 h is intriguing . in s. cerevisiae, the dolichyl pyrophosphate  phosphatase of the er encoded by cwh <dig> converts dolp-p to dol-p  in the luminal leaflet of the er and dol-p is reutilized for the synthesis of the lipid-linked core-oligosaccharide chain  <cit> . the cwh8p-catalyzed reaction represents a limiting step in the rate of protein glycosylation and the increase of the cwh <dig> transcript seems consistent with the need of active mannoprotein synthesis in the phr1Δ mutant.

crh11p transglycosidase and the hws response
among the “cell wall” genes, the crh <dig> transcript was more abundant in the phr1Δ mutant at all time points. crh <dig> is the only member of a family of three genes that includes utr2/csf <dig> and crh <dig>  to respond to cell wall stress at the transcriptional level  <cit> . its homolog sccrh <dig> is also up-regulated in cell wall mutants and in cells treated with congo red or zymolyase  <cit> . sccrh1p acts in vitro and in vivo in the cross-linking of chitin chains to β-and β-glucan which in turn can be linked to gpi-mannoproteins yielding a more resistant wall  <cit> . assuming a functionally analogous role, c. albicans crh11p combined with the observed increase in chitin and mannoprotein expression, could enhance the establishment of new cross-linkages between chitin-glucan and gpi-mannoproteins to protect cells from lysis. thus, crh <dig> is at the core of both the cell wall and hyphal wall stress response.

comparison with the caspofungin-induced cell wall stress response
caspofungin  induces cell wall stress by inhibiting β-glucan synthesis and the response to this cellular insult might be expected to partially overlap the response to loss of phr1p. bruno et al.  defined a core set of  <dig> cs-responsive genes by combining their results and those of liu et al.  <cit> . of the phr1-responsive genes,  <dig> were in common with the core cs-responsive genes defined after 1 h-treatment: four were down-regulated  whereas five were up-regulated . three of these genes  showed sustained expression in the phr1Δ mutant whereas the others declined at 3 h , suggesting these genes may be more critical to the cell’s attempt to counteract hyphal wall damage. in addition, pga <dig>  also a cs-induced gene  <cit> , is persistently up-regulated in the phr1Δ mutant. notably, the expression of crh <dig>  pga <dig>  pga <dig>  ecm <dig> is governed by cas <dig>  encoding a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays a major role in cell wall damage response  <cit> . in our study, cas <dig> is repressed in the wild type but not in the phr1Δ mutant .

lastly, chs <dig> and chs <dig> are up-regulated in cs-treated cells  <cit>  as in phr1Δ mutant. the map kinases mkc1p and hog1p, and also ca++-calcineurin were demonstrated to contribute to chs <dig> and chs <dig> up-regulation  <cit> .

chs <dig> and chs <dig> preserve phr1Δ cell integrity in different conditions of filamentation
among the four chitin synthases of c. albicans, the role of chs <dig> and chs <dig> in cell wall stress is still poorly understood. their transcript levels increase not only in response to cs, but also following treatments with cacl <dig> and cw, which stimulates chitin synthesis  <cit> . while this correlates with an increase in the in vitro activity of these enzymes, there is no corresponding increase in chitin accumulation in vivo  <cit> . our functional analyses demonstrate that chs <dig> is crucial during hyphal growth in the absence of phr1p and support the notion that chs3p is the major compensatory chitin synthase both in cell wall stress and hws in fungi  <cit> . however, our results also provide new hints to the understanding of the biological role of chs2p and chs8p in the response to hws. interestingly, chs2p and chs8p contribute to the chitin increase in the phr1Δ mutant during filamentation in broth culture, but are not crucial for viability. moreover, chs1p seems to contribute to growth of phr1Δ, although this aspect was not further explored in this study. our results indicate that a complex interplay among the different isoforms buffers the damage to the hyphal cell wall. these results can be reconciled by taking into account that different isoforms produce different types of chitin fibrils not all of which may be equally effective in reinforcing the lateral wall. the recruitment of other chs isoforms during hws reveals a difference between c. albicans and s. cerevisiae. in s. cerevisiae the absence of chs3p does not lead to chitin deposition by other isoforms, namely the class i chitin synthase chs1p  despite the fact that scchs <dig> is always up-regulated by cell wall stress  <cit> .

the phr1Δ mutation combined with deletion of chsx genes produced a more severe phenotype during hyphal growth on agar-solidified media. phr <dig> was synthetic lethal with chs <dig> at the onset of germination on m199-ph  <dig> . at ph  <dig>  loss of chs <dig> alone, or in combination with chs <dig> inactivation, produced cell death or a very strong lysis phenotype of germinated cells, respectively. thus, the requirement for chs3p and chs8p functions occurs at different stages in the transition of single cells to filamentous growth. on spider medium, phr <dig> was synthetic lethal with chs <dig> or chs <dig> only at ph  <dig>  therefore, nutrient-rich growth media, such as m <dig>  represent a more restrictive condition for phr1Δ cells whereas a slow-filamentation medium, such as spider, allows adaptation, provided hws is not too severe. these results clearly demonstrate that chs <dig> and chs <dig> have unique roles in cell wall chitin synthesis, and one cannot compensate for the other. moreover, their roles are not evident by simply assessing total chitin content.

a recent report demonstrated for the first time that class i chitin synthases  in c. albicans play a role in maintaining cell integrity during early polarized bud and hyphal growth and immediately following septation events in hyphae and in the presence of stress  <cit> . this role is supported by the dynamic localization of these enzymes  <cit> . this may explain why in a condition of intense polarization such as the y-h transition the lack of glucan remodeling makes the activity of the otherwise dispensable chs <dig> physiologically crucial.

since chs8p and phr1p localize to the hyphal septum, we also postulate that loss of phr1p function at this site is highly harmful for c. albicans. our model predicts that in the absence of chs8p and phr1p, more chs3p is recruited to the septum to reinforce the cell wall during filamentation. this may explain the decrease in cw-staining of lateral walls and the maintenance of an intense signal at the septum in the chs8Δ phr1Δ mutant . experiments using fluorescent-tagged versions of chs proteins will be necessary to test this model.

finally, it is well-known that chs3p is regulated primarily at a post-transcriptional level such as recruitment to the plasma membrane from intracellular compartments and recycling  and regulation of its location by phosphorylation  <cit> . at 5 h, the level of the chs <dig> transcript in phr1Δ cells is higher than in the wild type suggesting that chs3p folding and export from er could be crucial in the response to hws.

other functions affected by hws
finally, we demonstrated that the block in morphogenesis brings about an accelerated entry into s-phase and g <dig>  in c. albicans, cells enter s-phase when germ tubes reach a critical length or size. stabilization of the g <dig> cyclin and delayed accumulation of the mitotic cyclins clb <dig> and clb <dig> occurring during germ tube formation suggests an extended g <dig> phase with respect to yeast cells . the mechanism regulating this seems to be altered or negated in the presence of phr1Δ defects which block the hyphal morphogenic program. moreover, in the mutant, genes involved in rrna processing, maturation and transport are repressed at 1 h. this response could be a consequence of the morphogenetic defect as an early repression of ribosome biogenesis genes was also detected in the block of hyphae formation by farnesol  <cit> .

interestingly, the cyclin genes pcl <dig>  pcl <dig> and ccn <dig>  a homolog of clb <dig> in s. cerevisiae, normally repressed in cells induced to make hyphae, are up-regulated both in phr1Δ and in farnesol-arrested hyphae . also, the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc <dig> is up-regulated at all three time points in the phr1Δ mutant. the high rf at 5 h for ccn <dig>  cdc <dig>  gin <dig> suggests that the complex of ccdc28p-ccn1p, that associates with the septins and phosphorylates cdc11p after a previous phosphorylation requiring the septin-associated gin4p  <cit> , may persist in the mutant and possibly involved in preventing catastrophic effects on the nuclear division cycle. future studies will address the relations between the block of morphogenesis and cell cycle-regulated events under hyphal growth conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
the glucan remodeling activity catalyzed by phr1p is fundamental for the progression of hyphal growth and its absence modifies genome-wide expression profiles to trigger a reinforcement of the cell surface and changes in several functions affecting metabolism and transport, cell cycle and dna replication, transcription and stress response in order to restore integrity and homeostasis. genes that are differentially modulated compared to the wild type help explain some phenotypic traits typical of the mutant such as the defect of adhesion, besides providing evidence of new functions with potentially important roles in the adaptive response to hws. one of these genes is flc <dig> encoding a putative calcium transporter that in s. cerevisiae is involved in the release of calcium from intracellular stores in response to hypotonic shock  <cit> . our findings also revealed a novel essential role of chs <dig> in protecting cell integrity during growth on agar plates in condition of very severe hsw.
