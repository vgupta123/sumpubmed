BACKGROUND
copepods are among the most abundant metazoans on the planet and include more than  <dig>  described species  <cit> . they are ecologically important, spanning a broad range of marine, freshwater and moist terrestrial habitats and serving as major players in global energy transfer, including the largest portion of carbon turnover in the oceanic food web  <cit> . they are also of economic interest, serving as both prey and parasites of valuable fishery species. despite their ecological and economic importance, there are few genetic resources developed for copepods, and existing models are likely to be of limited use in this group.

the overwhelming majority of arthropod model systems are insects. additionally, daphnia pulex  has recently been sequenced  <cit> . however, neither insects nor daphnia are phylogenetically close to copepods. while the precise topology of the arthropod phylogeny is currently debated, the split between insecta, copepoda and branchiopoda is deep in the cambrian. shrimp  are somewhat more closely related to copepods and have been the subject of genetic work  due to their economic importance in the seafood market. however, like other decapods, shrimp have high rates of genomic duplication, complicating genomic analyses and rendering them less useful as models  <cit> .

tigriopus californicus is an increasingly attractive genetic model copepod and model crustacean. it has a history as an experimental system for environmental stress, ecotoxicology and speciation  <cit> , is easily cultured in the lab, and has an experimentally tractable life cycle. it also has one of the smaller known crustacean genomes--a full order of magnitude smaller than the tiger shrimp penaeus monodon  <cit> .

t. californicus has an extensive range along the west coast of north america, from alaska to baja california. it is a supralittoral marine harpacticoid copepod, inhabiting splash pools of the rocky shore. it has extremely limited gene flow, with strong genetic differentiation between even geographically close populations  <cit> . populations from santa cruz and san diego, california are the focus of concerted efforts for the development of genetic resources by several labs. the transcriptomes of the two populations have recently been published  <cit> . a linkage map comprising  <dig> microsatellite markers and  <dig> nuclear snps has also recently been constructed  <cit>  with a corrected map length of  <dig>  cm, where the  <dig> linkage groups and one unlinked marker apparently corresponded to the  <dig> chromosomes of t. californicus  <cit> .

a linkage map is a reference point for understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. it is a valuable tool for genome-wide scans of genetic variation, for dissection of qtl  and for the assembly of a physical map. by focusing on developing gene-based markers, our map will facilitate comparative studies using orthologous genes.

we here develop a linkage map between the santa cruz and san diego populations, comprising  <dig> snp markers. we validate these markers in  <dig> additional, geographically distinct populations of t. californicus. we also screen the markers in two commonly studied congeners with similar ecology: t. japonicus, which is distributed around the asian pacific rim, and t. brevicornis, which is distributed from portugal to nova scotia around the northern atlantic. many of the markers we develop are also reliably detectable in these two congeners, and will be broadly useful as a community resource for genetic mapping in these species. the development of this linkage map is an essential prelude to the more detailed genomic characterization of a model copepod.

methods
snp development
the majority of snps were identified from  <dig> cdna sequence data for the santa cruz  and san diego  t. californicus populations  <cit> . sequences were aligned using the gsassembler  and visualized in consed  <cit> . diagnostic sc/sd fixed snps were chosen using the following criteria: contig > 200bp, minimum of  <dig> reads for each population, significant sequence alignment to metazoan sequence  with an e-value ≤ 10- <dig> and sufficient conserved flanking regions for priming sites. another subset of potential snps were identified from known gene sequences obtained from genbank or from unpublished data . for each of the markers with a positive genetic identification, the name of the marker is consistent with the putative-orthologue name, taken as the most-significant alignment using tblastx at  <cit> . the one exception is tfam, where the most significant alignment is to a predicted gene product in tribolium castaneum of the general class of transcription factors which includes tfam. subsequent best alignments are to tfam orthologues in a number of species.

primers and extension sequences for iplex high throughput genotyping were developed from this dataset by jeffrey conroy at the genomic shared resources, roswell park cancer institute, buffalo, ny, using the iplex gold software . primer and extension sequences are shown in additional file  <dig>   <dig> snp assays were designed for multiplexing in a total of  <dig> wells, with a maximum of  <dig> assays in each well. sequences ranged from 15-29bp. within each well, the minimum molecular weight of a sequence was  <dig> daltons, and the maximum weight was  <dig>  daltons . the minimum difference between any two products was  <dig> daltons. sequences were scored for molecular weight in a sequenom mass spectrometer, and snp identity determined by molecular weight.

snps were validated for  <dig> adult males and  <dig> adult females from each of the sc and sd lines, and found to be fixed for alternate alleles in each population, with heterozygotes confirmed in  <dig> f <dig> hybrids. snps were also tested in  <dig> additional populations of t. californicus , and a single population each of t. brevicornis and t. japonicus . a panel of  <dig> previously utilized snps  <cit>  was also included, including  <dig> mitochondrial markers to test for contamination.

dna extraction
nauplii  for genotyping were hatched from late-stage egg sacs isolated in single drops of seawater in a petri plate. the petri plate was flooded with lysis buffer . individual nauplii were pipetted in 2- <dig> μl of buffer to  <dig> μl pcr tubes containing  <dig> μl of buffer with  <dig> μg/ml proteinase k . tubes were incubated at 65°c for  <dig> hr followed by 100°c for  <dig> min and then frozen at -80°c. dna extraction of adult individuals followed a similar procedure except that individuals were briefly rinsed in dih2o and blotted dry on filter paper  before being frozen at -80°c. adult samples were subsequently extracted in  <dig> μl lysis buffer with  <dig> μl/ml proteinase k .  <dig> μl of each sample was dried at 60°c for  <dig> hours before being sent to the roswell park cancer institute for genotyping, and the remaining  <dig> μl was retained at -80°c for future work.

f <dig> mapping population
upon maturation, males of t. californicus perform mate guarding--holding an immature female until she is mature, then mating with her and releasing her. observing clasped dyads facilitates sexing of immature individuals, and allows the ready collection of virgins. females are known to mate only a single time in their life, and use stored sperm to fertilize multiple clutches of eggs  <cit> . inbred--isofemale--lines are therefore established by isolating a single fertilized female and allowing offspring, including those from overlapping generations, to mate freely.

isofemale lines were established from sc and sd populations and were maintained in the laboratory for  <dig>  years. with a minimum generation time of  <dig> days, at 20°c, this corresponds to approximately  <dig> generations of culture. all laboratory stocks were reared in a standard medium of thrice-filtered  seawater with added growth medium . crosses between sd females and sc males were conducted in  <dig> ml beakers containing  <dig> ml of growth medium. six replicate crosses consisted each of  <dig> males and  <dig> females. males were discarded after  <dig> week. females were removed after  <dig> weeks, when copepodids  became visible. when clasping pairs of f <dig> offspring were observed, the males and females were separated and then united with a partner descending from a different beaker to avoid potential full sibling mating . single pairs comprising an f <dig> female and an f <dig> male were placed in separate petri plates containing  <dig> ml of culture medium. males were removed when an egg sac was observed, and females moved to fresh plates as each successive clutch hatched.  <dig> first instar nauplii were collected for genotyping. in previous experiments, little segregation distortion has been observed in early stage nauplii  <cit> .

additional samples for genotyping
in addition to the f <dig> hybrids we also genotyped  <dig> non-recombinant backcross hybrid adults . because t. californicus females do not undergo recombination  <cit>  this non-recombinant cross allows confirmation that linkage groups identified from the f <dig> mapping population are on different chromosomes. lastly, between  <dig> and  <dig> adult individuals from  <dig> other populations of t. californicus, as well as t. brevicornis and t. japonicus were collected for genotyping.

mapping
the use of previously mapped snps  <cit>  and cytochrome-c  <cit>  enabled us to maintain chromosomal identity from previous work. chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were anchored to the linkage groups of harrison and edmands  <cit>  and pritchard et al.  <cit>  . our current chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> correspond to the linkage groups of a, b, and c respectively of pritchard et al.  <cit>  and we were not able to anchor them to harrison and edmands  <cit> .

the linkage map was constructed using the joinmap  <dig>  software package  <cit> . the kosambi mapping function was used, with an lod threshold of  <dig> , a recombination threshold of  <dig> , and default values for all other settings. correct assignment of markers to chromosomes was confirmed using the non-recombinant backcross genotypes. several markers exhibited substantial apparent segregation distortion, departing significantly from hardy weinberg expectation . we did not exclude these a priori from the analysis. following construction of the map, we examined the proposed haplotypes and found that, for the  <dig> most distorted markers we would have to posit recombination in females at levels above 25% between the distorted markers and their nearest neighbors to explain the marker states. as recombination in females is known to not occur at levels >1%  <cit> , we excluded these  <dig> markers from the analysis. we were unable to determine the source of this apparent genotyping error, but one possibility is cryptic, previously unidentified polymorphism.

predicted effect of snps on protein sequence
nucleotides that are under lower selective constraint might be expected to have higher substitution rates, and thus may be expected to have more alleles across populations. for all snps, we used the probable coding sequences of barreto et al.  <cit>  to determine whether the snp was in a translated region of the transcript, and if so, whether or not the snps were synonymous. snp positions and translations were calculated by matching the sequenom extension sequences against the transcripts of baretto et al  <cit>  using the bioperl  module of perl .

synteny with model species
we attempted to find signs of macrosynteny with several assembled arthropod genomes--the insects apis mellifera  <cit> , assembly  <dig> , with a 1n = 16; d. melanogaster  <cit>  assembly  <dig> , with 1n =  <dig> ; and tribolium castaneum  <cit>  assembly  <dig>  with a 1n = 12; and the recently sequenced branchiopod crustacean, daphnia pulex  <cit>  beta  <dig> release with a 1n =  <dig>  of these, the insect genomes were the most fully assembled, and we were able to disregard any unanchored scaffolds. in d. pulex, there were far more unanchored scaffolds--3804--and we did not exclude any .

to identify homologs, we performed sequence alignment searches using tblastx of the flanking sequence for each of our mapped markers  against each reference draft genome assembly, with a threshold of e-value ≤ 10- <dig> and the default settings. several sequences had multiple alignments exceeding this threshold, and in these cases we considered only the most significant sequence alignment. the a. mellifera amino acid sequences were obtained from <cit> . the t. castaneum amino acid sequences were obtained from  <cit> , and the chromosomal location of the most significant alignments for both the a. mellifera and t. castaneum genomes were obtained by querying the batch entrez database at  <cit>  with the gi numbers. the d. melanogaster v.  <dig>  sequences were obtained from flybase  <cit> . the d. pulex amino acid sequences were obtained from  <cit>  and the scaffold identity of these sequences subsequently obtained by tblastn to the genomic scaffold obtained at the same site. where a pair of putative homologs colocalized to a single linkage group in both species, we scored it as a single potential syntenic unit. where three markers colocalized in this way, we scored  <dig> alignments . we summed all potential syntenic units for each species . significance was determined by randomly permuting the homolog locations relative to the t. californicus chromosomal map positions  <dig> times in r  <cit> , and counting the number of estimated syntenic units each time.

the number of linkage groups of the draft reference genomes of each species are shown, with the number of identified homologues between t. californicus and each of the reference genomes, and the number of homologue pairs which colocalize to a linkage group in both t. californicus and the reference. the maximum  number of colocalized pairs we would expect to see by chance, and the significance of the observed number of colocalized pairs were determined by permutation.

RESULTS
snp development
of the total of  <dig> nuclear snps we assayed,  <dig> snps were found to be reliable in our genotyping pools, including  <dig> of the previously developed markers  <cit> . only these  <dig> snp markers are reported here . in nauplii, none of these markers were found to be significantly distorted after bonferroni correction. primers and extension sequences were found to be widely conserved within populations of t. californicus, as well as sister species t. brevicornis and t. japonicus. many of the snps identified in the sc-sd comparison were polymorphic within other populations . the number of fixed differences between populations, as well as segregating polymorphisms within populations, together represent the potential pool of markers for mapping in t. californicus. the number of potential markers for use in mapping differences between population pairs appears in the above-diagonal of table  <dig> 

mapping
the final assembly consisted of  <dig> linkage groups, corresponding to the known  <dig> chromosomes of t. californicus . these  <dig> linkage groups were confirmed by results from the non-recombinant backcross. the average intermarker distance was  <dig>  cm, and the maximum distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  cm. the sum of the distances between the markers gives an estimated linkage map length of  <dig>  cm long. applying the suggested correction method  to estimate total map length, where li is map length of a given chromosome i, and mi is the number of markers for that linkage group, ltot= ∑i×∕= <dig> cm. we estimated total coverage following  <cit> . given total marker number n =  <dig>  and average intermarker distance d =  <dig>  cm, the proportion coverage c=1-e-2dn∕ltot= <dig> . the recombination rate, given the estimated haploid genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> , corresponds approximately  <dig>  cm/mbp. the sizes of the linkage groups ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> cm.

predicted effect of snps on protein sequence
of the  <dig> snps used to construct the linkage map,  <dig>  are predicted to be translated, and of these  <dig>   <dig>  are synonymous substitutions. of these  <dig> loci, there are other synonymous substitutions possible at  <dig> loci .

synteny with model species
orthologues to  <dig> of the  <dig> t. californicus sequences were detected in the reference genomes . the greatest number of detected orthologues  was with reference to the d. melanogaster genome, and the lowest  was with d. pulex. there was evidence of macrosynteny between t. californicus and the a. mellifera genome. nine pairs of orthologous genes were found to colocalize on chromosomes in both species, above the maximum of  <dig> pairs we might expect to find colocalizing by chance. after applying a bonferroni correction for  <dig> tests, for each of the reference genomes, the confidence interval for the number of syntenic units shared between the two species is still below the p =  <dig>  threshold for significance as determined by permutation .

discussion
we successfully mapped the t. californicus nuclear genome, using  <dig> previously described snps, and  <dig> novel snps, to a total of  <dig> markers. this corresponds to an average of  <dig> marker every  <dig>  mbp, and an average intermarker distance of  <dig>  cm. all markers were assigned to linkage groups, and the maximum intermarker distance was  <dig>  cm. we will thus be able to use these markers to impute genotypes in interval mapping with 95% accuracy or better for all positions in the genome. the  <dig> linkage groups obtained corresponded to the  <dig> known chromosomes of t. californicus, and most were anchored to linkage groups previously identified with microsatellite and amplified fragment length polymorphism  markers  <cit> . the total corrected map length of  <dig>  cm was somewhat lower than the estimated map length of pritchard et al.  <cit> , and the estimated total coverage of  <dig> % was also somewhat lower than their  <dig> % coverage, but this difference in estimates is unsurprising given the much deeper coverage we have achieved in the current study.

all crosses between populations of t. californicus from southern california to british columbia produce fertile f <dig> progeny  <cit> . pairs of populations, however, exhibit increasing f <dig> hybrid breakdown by distance--populations as close as  <dig> km can have a reduction in fitness of 50% in the f <dig> relative to the parental populations  <cit> . we found no evidence of segregation distortion in the nauplii of our mapping population, however. this is consistent with previous studies which found generally undistorted allele frequencies in the early larval stage, while adults had allele frequencies which strongly departed from expected frequencies  <cit> .

primer sequences used for polymerase chain reaction dna amplifications were largely conserved between populations. in only one population  did more than  <dig> primer sets fail to amplify a product, and we found many snps segregating within and between populations. the elevated differentiation between pa and the southern californian populations was not unexpected, as baja populations of t. californicus have been found to be very divergent in mitochondrial haplotype  <cit> , and to exhibit high rates of hybrid breakdown when crossed with northern populations  <cit> . many of our primers also amplified products in the sister species t. japonicus and t. brevicornis. the snp markers we have characterized here, therefore will be generally useful for qtl mapping across the entire geographic range of t. californicus. for all but a few population pairs, it will be possible to construct mapping lines and distinguish every chromosome in a non-recombinant backcross design.

additional snps may be found to segregate in these populations, since they were only genotyped for the known sd and sc snps . only  <dig> of the snp markers were in coding regions at twofold degenerate sites, suggesting as many as  <dig> % of the snps may be under relaxed selective constraint. populations will thus need to be characterized for alternate alleles for mapping purposes. the known level of triallely of snps is very low in t. californicus, however. v. pritchard  found that between san diego, santa cruz and punta baja , levels of triallely are approximately 2% at snp sites across the genome. these  <dig> populations are deeply divergent within t. californicus, suggesting that within-species at least, there will be few uncharacterized alleles.

compared with the other arthropods, the recombination rate of t. californicus  is low , but is more than sufficient for mapping in f <dig>  backcross and other linkage mapping approaches. it is similar to that of diptera and shrimp penaeus monodon  <cit> , but it is approximately 21% the estimated recombination rate of daphnia pulex at  <dig>  cm/mbp  <cit> . it is much lower than hymenoptera , and somewhat lower than the more typical arthropod recombination rate of coleoptera   <cit> . it is known that recombination rates in groups with alternate life histories are under selection--for instance, social vs. solitary hymenoptera have greatly elevated recombination rates. the relatively high recombination rate of d. pulex compared to shrimp and t. californicus is possibly due to its reproductive mode--many generations of parthenogenesis, punctuated by episodic sex, may have consequences on the evolution of recombination rate  <cit> . another reason for the relatively low recombination rate might be that recombination occurs only in males in t. californicus  <cit> .

additionally, perhaps surprisingly, there was some evidence of macrosynteny between a. mellifera and t. californicus, although there was no one-to-one correspondence between chromosomes. no evidence of synteny was found t. californicus and d. pulex or d. melanogaster; however, this may be because these genomes have undergone higher rates of chromosomal rearrangements. it was reported that no evidence of synteny was found between d. pulex and d. melanogaster either  <cit> . in fact, critescu et al.  <cit>  suggest--based on the rearrangement rate of drosophila--that synteny should only be apparent between crustaceans and insects at scales smaller than  <dig> kb. it may be that hymenoptera and copepoda have lower rates of large-scale chromosomal fission and fusion than drosophila and the other assayed arthropod lineages.

CONCLUSIONS
we have mapped the t. californicus genome to a level of coverage that will enable common mapping techniques such as nonrecombinant backcross, and f <dig> or recombinant inbred line mapping--greatly expanding the possible scope of work in this species. the markers and map developed will potentially be useful more broadly in the genus tigriopus. the phylogenetic position of t. californicus, its compact genome size, and its tractability in the lab have all positioned it as an excellent model crustacean system. the continued development of genomic tools such as this linkage map will enable future exciting work in this species.
