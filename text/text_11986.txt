BACKGROUND
leishmaniases are classified according to their clinical manifestations as cutaneous, mucocutaneous, visceral and post kala-azar dermal  <cit> . these diseases are endemic in  <dig> countries on five different continents, threatening about  <dig> million people and being considered a public health problem  <cit> . they are caused by flagellate protozoa from the genus leishmania, which are transmitted to humans and other mammals by sandflies. in the mammalian host, leishmania spp. infect macrophages, thus being studied not only as the causative agents of leishmaniases, but also as a model for intracellular parasitism  <cit> .

promising targets for drug design and discovery against leishmaniases include enzymes involved in fundamental metabolic pathways for these parasites such as nucleoside diphosphate kinases    <cit> . ndks catalyze the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate donor to a nucleoside diphosphate acceptor  <cit> , using a ping-pong mechanism involving a phosphohistidine intermediate  <cit> . the protein is considered a housekeeping enzyme and is essential for the maintenance of intracellular ntp levels  <cit> . eukaryotic ndks have been associated with several biological processes such as g proteins regulation  <cit> , polysaccharide synthesis  <cit> , cell elongation  <cit>  and gene transcription  <cit> .

in pathogenic microorganisms, additional roles are proposed for secreted ndks, including modulation of host purinergic signaling and attenuation of reactive oxygen species production  <cit> . leishmania amazonensis, for instance, secretes ndk during infection, preventing atp-mediated cytolysis of macrophages  <cit> . therefore, this multifunctional enzyme also works on preserving the integrity of host cells to benefit the parasites  <cit> .

despite the high similarity in amino acid sequence, ndks can assume different quaternary arrangements. most eukaryotic ndks form hexamers while some bacterial enzymes form tetramers  <cit> . the main difference between tetrameric and hexameric ndks relies on their c-terminal region. in tetrameric ndks, the c-terminal extension interacts with the neighboring subunit of the same dimer, whereas in hexameric ndks this region interacts with the adjacent dimer, contributing for hexamer stability  <cit> .

in hexameric ndks, the quaternary structure is important for enzymatic activity  <cit> . however little is known about how environment conditions such as ionic strength and ph affect their oligomeric stability. it has been demonstrated that salt concentration modulate hexameric assembly and activity of a halophilic ndk  <cit> , but the influence of ph in hexameric ndks stability remains elusive. here we report the crystal structure and spectroscopic characterization of l. braziliensis ndk  under distinct ph conditions similar to that faced by the parasite in the macrophages  <cit> . our data shed light on conformational changes associated with acidic conditions, which decrease hexamer stability and reveal that the c-terminal extension of lbndk is partially unstructured, an unusual feature among eukaryotic ndks.

the lbndk monomer consists of six α-helices partially involving a core of four β-strands arranged in a β2β3β1β <dig> antiparallel topology order, as observed in canonical ndk structures   <cit> . interestingly, this fold is recurrent in different nucleotide-binding proteins  <cit> . b-factor analysis indicates that the n- and c-terminal extremities as well as regions not involved in dimer/trimer interfaces are the most flexible . the highest flexibility comes from the c-terminal extension, whose last  <dig> residues in chain a and  <dig> residues in chain b were completely disordered and therefore were not modelled.figure  <dig>

lbndk conserves the proline residue  from the kpn-loop  involved in ndk stability  <cit> . together with a region named head   <cit> , the kpn-loop  forms a cleft that harbors the highly positively-charged active site , required for recognition and binding of negatively-charged substrates. as demonstrated for other ndks, lbndk also conserves the key residue his <dig>  which is essential for phosphate transfer  <cit> , tyr <dig>  important for catalytic mechanism and phe <dig> that stacks with the base of nucleotide substrates  <cit> . other  <dig> residues already described as important for catalysis in homolog proteins are present as well  <cit> .

analysis of symmetry-related chains in the crystalline unit cell revealed a hexameric arrangement similar to that observed for lmndk  <cit> . the hexamer can be seen as a trimer of dimers . the dimer interface  is more extensive than the trimer interface  and comprises residues mainly from α <dig> and β <dig> elements . the oε <dig> and oε <dig> atoms of glu <dig> act as key hydrogen bond acceptors, contributing for dimer stabilization via hydrogen bonds with main-chain nitrogen atoms of val <dig> and gly <dig> from the interfacing subunit . additional hydrophobic interactions involving the residues ala <dig> and trp <dig> located at the c-terminal extension also stabilize the dimer. these residues interact with val <dig>  met <dig> and pro <dig> from the adjacent subunit, restricting solvent accessibility to the surface area buried in this interface.figure  <dig>

in the trimer interface, residues located at α <dig> and β3-α <dig> loop make hydrogen bonds with residues located in the α <dig> and kpn-loop from the other subunit . the lys30nζ atom is the main hydrogen bond donor to carbonyl oxygens from arg <dig>  gly <dig> and ala <dig> residues, contributing for trimer stabilization along with the lys80-asp <dig> ionic interaction and the hydrogen bond between arg <dig> side chain and arg <dig> backbone .

lbndk displays an unstructured c-terminus
lbndk and homolog lmndk  monomers superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> cα atoms aligned and a sequence identity of  <dig> %. the main structural difference is in the last  <dig> residues of the c-terminal extension. in lmndk, these residues are ordered and some of them contribute for hexamer stabilization, such as his <dig> at the dimer interface and ile <dig>  tyr <dig> and glu <dig> at the trimer interface. intramolecular interactions of val <dig> with tyr <dig>  ile <dig> and tyr <dig> contribute to maintain the lmndk c-terminus structured . their side chains form a hydrophobic cluster that keeps tyr <dig> tied to its own subunit surface. by comparing the c-terminal sequence of lbndk and lmndk, we observed only two residue substitutions. replacement of lmndk val <dig> and ser <dig> residues by an alanine and a cysteine, respectively, might account for the destabilization of lbndk c-terminus .figure  <dig>

since ile <dig>  tyr <dig> and glu <dig> compose the trimer interface in lmndk, the lack of these interactions in lbndk may influence the hexamer stability. indeed, pdbepisa analysis of lbndk and lmndk interfaces indicate that the lmndk trimer interface is energetically more stable  than that of lbndk . the trimer interface area of lmndk, whose c-terminus is structured, is  <dig>  Å <dig> whereas in lbndk, whose c-terminus is disordered, it is reduced to  <dig>  Å <dig>  thus, absence of a well-structured c-terminal extension seems also to affect the hexameric stability. it is known that the deletion of 1– <dig> residues at the c-terminus of the ndk from dictyostelium severely decrease its thermal tolerance  <cit> , reinforcing the importance of this region for the structure.

the presence of an unstructured c-terminus is an atypical feature among eukaryotic ndks. from the deposited three-dimensional structures in the pdb, only the human ndk  <dig>   <cit>  shares this feature with lbndk, according to the structure similarity searches using the pdbefold service  <cit> . besides the probable influence in hexamer stability, the lack of the c-terminus interactions at the trimer interface exposes a surface path formed by pro <dig>  asp <dig>  gln <dig>  arg <dig> and the region from val <dig> to arg <dig> that might be explored for the rational design of compounds to inhibit hexamer formation, considered essential for enzymatic activity.

lbndk is a hexamer at a broad ph range
in order to investigate whether the crystallographic hexamer is the oligomeric state of lbndk in solution at different ph conditions, dynamic light scattering  and small angle x-ray scattering  experiments were performed. dls assays showed monodisperse populations  with average hydrodynamic radius  varying between  <dig> and 46 Å in the ph range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the molecular masses estimated in these conditions are similar to the theoretical mass of the hexamer , indicating that lbndk maintains the hexameric arrangement either upon medium acidification or alkalization .table  <dig>

saxs experiments performed at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed similar results, regardless the ph condition, corroborating dls data . from the scattering and pair-distance distribution curves at ph  <dig> , the maximum molecular dimension  was determined as 83 Å with a radius of gyration of 32 Å and a calculated molecular mass of 109 kda, which is accordance with the theoretical mass of the hexamer . moreover, the hexameric crystal structure showed a good agreement with the molecular envelope generated from saxs data by ab initio calculations, supporting that the crystallographic hexamer corresponds to the oligomeric state assumed by lbndk in solution . the ph decrease from  <dig>  to  <dig>  did not altered significantly the scattering curves of lbndk , indicating that the enzyme remains hexameric in ph conditions akin to that faced by the enzyme secreted by leishmania spp. in the parasitophorous vacuoles   <cit> .figure  <dig>

conformational stability under distinct ph conditions
to gain insights into the effect of ph in secondary structure and hexamer stability, circular dichroism , differential scanning fluorimetry  and fluorescence experiments were performed. with decreasing ph, the cd spectra started to change, especially at ph  <dig> , suggesting that acidification induces conformational changes in lbndk . dsf assay pointed out that ph changes influence the lbndk thermal stability. lbndk presented considerably lower stability at ph  <dig>  as showed by the negative tm shifts of more than 10°c compared to the highest tm , estimated at ph  <dig>  . between ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , tm shifts of about 5°c were observed, suggesting that lbndk presents similar thermal stability at this ph range .figure  <dig>

moreover, the single transition of the thermal denaturation curves  suggests that the denaturation does not occur by discretized steps involving hexamer dissociation followed by monomer unfolding. this result also agrees with saxs and dls assays, which indicates that the quaternary structure is maintained even at acidic or alkaline conditions . the single transition was also described for tetrameric and hexameric ndks from different organisms, indicating a similar thermodynamic denaturation process among these enzymes  <cit> .

lbndk has three tryptophan residues, at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the intrinsic fluorescence tryptophan emission  from those residues provided information about variations in their microenvironment, consequent from conformational changes induced by ph variations. at neutral ph, itfe of lbndk presented a λmax near to 328 nm , which shifted to near 332 nm at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , suggesting that either acidification or alkalization induce conformational changes that expose one or more tryptophan residues to a more polar environment. analysis of the parameter a indicates that lbndk maximal stability is reached between ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  . these data are consistent with a permanent occlusion of tryptophans in protein structure at this ph range. parameter a decreased both with increasing and decreasing ph, further supporting that conformational changes occur upon medium acidification or alkalization .

fluorescence quenching studies were also carried out to understand tryptophans microenvironments under neutral to acidic conditions. the stern-volmer plots for quenching of lbndk tryptophans by iodide  and acrylamide  are shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

when using iodide at ph  <dig> , no quenching is observed, indicating that trp <dig>  trp <dig> and trp <dig> are buried in the hydrophobic core of lbndk structure under this condition . the switching to acidic ph results in increasing values of  in function of nai concentration, suggesting that structural changes increase iodide accessibility to one or more tryptophans. the non-linearity of the curve measured at ph  <dig>  might be due to different levels of exposure of lbndk tryptophans to the solvent. supporting this hypothesis, analysis of lbndk crystal structure shows that trp <dig> is the most buried, with an accessible surface area  of  <dig>  Å <dig> followed by trp <dig>  and trp <dig>  the latter was not modeled in the chain b of the crystallographic structure due to the high flexibility of the c-terminal extension, thus it was not considered for these calculations.

results are slightly different using the quencher acrylamide . as it can access less exposed residues, acrylamide quenching is already observed at ph  <dig> . the quenching effects at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  were very similar, suggesting that ph variations in this range are not sufficient to alter the acrylamide accessibility.

CONCLUSIONS
although acidification decreases the thermal stability of lbndk, inducing conformational changes that affects secondary structure and tryptophans microenvironment, it is not sufficient to dissociate the hexamer, supporting that lbndk remains hexameric in ph conditions akin to that faced by this enzyme when secreted by leishmania amastigotes in the parasitophorous vacuoles   <cit> . differently from many eukaryotic ndks, lbndk displays an unstructured c-terminus that exposes a surface path in the trimer interface. as the quaternary structure of ndks is essential for full enzymatic activity  <cit> , the rational design and development of compounds targeting this exposed region may be a valuable strategy to discover new anti-leishmanial drugs.
