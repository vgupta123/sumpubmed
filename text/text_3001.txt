BACKGROUND
trail -related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a member of the tnf superfamily with the ability to induce apoptosis of tumor cells. at least five receptors for trail have been identified. dr <dig>   <cit>  and dr <dig>   <cit>  are apoptosis-inducing receptors. they contain an intracellular death domain each. upon receptor activation, dr <dig> and dr <dig> recruit fas associated protein with death domain   <cit>  and caspase- <dig> to form the death-inducing signaling complex , which activates caspase- <dig>  subsequently leading to the activation of executioner caspases such as caspase- <dig> that induce apoptosis  <cit> . in addition, other signaling pathways leading to nf-kb activation and activation of the erk, jnk, and p <dig> map kinase pathways are generated by a second complex that forms after the receptor-containing disc  <cit> ; dcr <dig>  <cit>  and dcr <dig>  <cit>  are nonsignaling decoy receptors, which can bind to trail but cannot trigger apoptosis. dcr <dig> lacks cytoplasmic death domain entirely  <cit> , whereas dcr <dig> has a nonfunctional truncated death domain  <cit> . dcr <dig> and dcr <dig> are unable to recruit fadd or signal apoptosis and inhibit apoptosis by sequestering trail or by forming complexes with dr <dig> and dr <dig> to create heteromeric receptor complexes that are unable to activate signaling  <cit> ; another receptor, osteoprotegerin, is a soluble receptor that binds to trail with a dissociation constant of  <dig> nm, which is the lowest affinity of the known trail receptors  <cit> . it may have a more prominent role in bone and myeloid cell development than in regulating trail-induced apoptosis.

a trail monomer contains two anti-parallel beta-pleated sheets that form a beta-sandwich as a core scaffold and interacts with the adjacent subunits in a head-to-tail fashion to form a bell-shaped homo-trimmer. trail and sdr <dig> form a tight 3: <dig> complex. three sdr <dig> molecules in a curved shape bind to the three identical grooves between neighboring subunits of trail, thereby inducing oligomerization of intracellular death domains. in complex trail, residues 130– <dig> display the most remarkable structural changes. the conformation of residues 146– <dig> interact with the core scaffold and the residues 130– <dig> undergoes a drastic positional change. they penetrate into the receptor-binding site and interact with sdr <dig>  this translocation is manifested by the strong electron densities observed for residues 130– <dig> of all the six trail molecules in the asymmetric unit. residues 131– <dig> penetrate into the central binding interface upon complex formation. the guanidino group of arg <dig> makes a polar interaction with tyr <dig> of sdr <dig>  asn <dig> and thr <dig> interact with glu <dig> and asn <dig> of sdr <dig>  respectively. the trail mutant with residues 132– <dig> deletion showed a profound decrease in the binding affinity for sdr <dig> and cytotoxic activity in vitro using human hepatoma cells, suggesting those residues bear direct correlation with the activity of trail  <cit> .

trail  <cit>  and agonistic antibodies that recognize trail receptors  <cit>  preferentially kill tumor cells and produce potent anti-tumor activity in a variety of experimental models. it is therefore hoped that these agents may be useful to treat cancer  <cit> . several clinical trials are ongoing with different trail receptor agonists alone or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs. rtrail , apoptosis-inducing anti-dr5/dr <dig> antibodies, or an agent that increases endogenous trail expression are available strategies for cancer therapy  <cit> . consistently, administration of trail to mice bearing human tumors actively suppressed tumor progression  <cit>  and improved survival of the animal. furthermore, repeated intravenous injections of trail in nonhuman primates did not cause detectable toxicity to normal tissues and organs, including liver tissues  <cit> . however, susceptibility of human normal hepatocytes to trail was reported recently  <cit> , therefore agonists against dr <dig> or dr <dig>  by activating apoptosis signal are becoming dramatically meaningful as candidate drugs for cancer therapy.

recently, preclinical studies of trail receptor agonists indicate that they may be efficacious in a wide range of tumor types, especially when combined with chemotherapeutic agents. receptor agonists, including recombinant forms of trail and monoclonal antibodies against dr <dig> or dr <dig>  are currently being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials in several cancer indications, in which at least four human or humanized monoclonal antibodies that target dr <dig> have been undergoing evaluation in clinical trials: lexatumumab , apomab, conatumumab , tigatuzumab . most of them could activates intracellular caspases and induce apoptosis in a wide spectrum of human cancer cell lines in vitro and have anti-tumor activity in a dose-dependent manner as a single agent in xenograft models. they also have synergistic or additive activity in combination with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation in vitro and/or in vivo. results of a phase i single-agent study showed that anti-dr <dig> antibodies were well tolerated, and some of them were studied about the safety and efficacy in a phase ii study of patients with cancer  <cit> .

many dr <dig> agonist antibodies require additional cross-linking to achieve optimal activity in vitro, such as apomab and tigatuzumab   <cit> . in xenograft models, this cross-linking function is likely provided by binding to fcγrs  <cit> . x-ray crystallographic analysis of apomab-dr <dig> complex revealed an interaction epitope that partially overlaps with trail binding regions. apomab-dr <dig> interface is centered in a nearly continuous region of dr <dig>  comprising residues 62– <dig>  with additional contributions from residues 99– <dig>  in which residues arg <dig>  ser <dig> and lys <dig> in dr <dig> seem to be the key sites. in contrast to apomab, another phage-derived dr <dig> antibody , which has little or no agonistic activity, interacts trail with different epitope  <cit> .

computational approaches can provide relevant information to predict binding activity and key functional domains between antigen and antibody complex. it enables researchers to study interactions in atomic detail, and find out how a specific mutation affects its function. computer-guided models combined with biological experiments could promote the process of identifying the key epitope for certain antigen in binding with its functional antibody. in this study, a novel anti-dr <dig> monoclonal antibody , ladr <dig>  was screened from dr5-immunized mice, which was more suitable for genetic engineering contrasting to previous mab   <cit> . the potential anti-tumor activity of ladr <dig> without cross-linking was characterized in vitro using jurkat cells. with the major advances in computer processing, the 3-d structure of ladr <dig> fv fragment was simulated based on homology modeling method, and the antigen-antibody  complex model were generated using molecular docking method. as the key domain in dr <dig> being predicted, three mutants of dr <dig>  dr5m <dig> , dr5m <dig>  and dr5m <dig>  were designed and prepared by affinity chromatograph, with which the differences of the functional epitope between trail and ladr <dig> were investigated.

RESULTS
immunization, screening, purification and antigen binding of ladr5
immunization, screening and purification of ladr <dig> were carried out using standard protocols described above. some positive monoclonal antibody clones against dr <dig> were screened out by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , in which ladr <dig>  an igg <dig> subtype antibody identified by double immunodiffusion method, was screened out. hybridoma cells were injected into the peritoneal cavity of balb/c mice. after 14 days ascites were collected and purified ladr <dig> was prepared by a column of protein a-sepharose 4b.

as shown in figure 1a, when 5 μg/ml dr <dig> or dr <dig> was coated, ladr <dig> could specifically bind dr <dig> in a dose-dependent manner rather than dr <dig>  meanwhile, trail could bind either dr <dig> or dr <dig>  furthermore, western blot analysis further displayed its capacity of ladr <dig> to bind dr <dig> with the predicted molecular weight of about 19kd , indicating that ladr <dig> couldn’t cross-react with dr <dig>  besides, trail could compete with ladr <dig> to bind dr <dig> in a dose-dependent manner, which suggested the epitope overlapping of trail and ladr <dig> .

to identify whether ladr <dig> could bind membrane dr <dig>  dr5-low expression cell line k <dig> and high-expression cell lines jurkat, u <dig> and daudi were used. as shown in table  <dig>  10 μg/ml ladr <dig> could bind jurkat , u <dig> , and daudi  cells, respectively, which were approximately consistent with the positive controls . ladr <dig> seemed not to bind k <dig> cells, with only  <dig>  % positive cells.

ladr <dig> could bind the membrane dr <dig> on jurkat , daudi  and u <dig> , which was essentially consistent with the standard anti-dr <dig> antibody treated samples . in k <dig> cells, the percentage of positive cells in standard anti-dr <dig> antibody treated sample was  <dig>  % contrasting to  <dig>  % in ladr <dig> incubated sample.

cytotoxic and apoptotic activity of ladr5
to test the cytotoxic activity of ladr <dig> in vitro, jurkat, u <dig>  k <dig> and daudi cell lines were cultured with diluted ladr <dig>  after  <dig> hours, cell viability was determined by mtt method. as shown in figure 1d, only jurkat cells died obviously in a dose-dependent manner . meanwhile, although daudi was also membrane-dr <dig> positive cell line, jurkat was more sensitive.

giemsa’s staining  showed that jurkat cells acquired typical features of apoptosis after being incubated with 10 μg/ml of ladr <dig>  including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and nuclear pyknosis.

then we analyzed the apoptotic-inducing ability of ladr <dig> to form a dr5-associated disc in cell lysates, indicating that binding of ladr <dig> to dr <dig> results in receptor oligomerization and initiation of apoptosis through the recruitment of fadd; meanwhile, only in jurkat cells caspase- <dig> could be detected within  <dig> minutes , indicating that ladr <dig> was an effective agonist to trigger apoptotic response in jurkat cells through fadd-caspase- <dig> pathway, while in ladr <dig> insensitive cell line daudi, the pathway was not triggered. normal cells, isotype igg treated cells and dr5-binding antibody 366ec  were set as negative controls.

the 3-d modeling structures of ladr <dig> fv fragment and dr5-ladr <dig> complex
the vh and vl sequences of ladr <dig> were determined by traditional isopropyl alcohol-chloroform extraction, rt-pcr, subcloning and sequenced as described above. then 3-d modeling structures of ladr <dig> vh and vl were obtained based on computer-guided homology modeling approach. using profile_3d program, the 3-d optimized structures of ladr <dig> vh and vl were analyzed. the results showed that more than 94 % of the residues were in the most favored regions. to obtain the structure of ladr <dig> fv fragment, the crystal structure of the esterolytic and amidolytic 43 c <dig> antibody was selected as template. consequently, the framework of 1h3p vl and 1a1r vh was superimposed on the corresponding 43 c <dig> vl and vh framework, using a rigid-body superimposition program  <cit> . a composite fv domain was thereby created with vl of 1h3p and vh of 1a1r in which most of the ‘key’ residues and their interactions in the vl-vh interface were conserved. using homology and docking methods , the 3-d structure of ladr <dig> fv fragment was constructed and optimized as shown in figure 3a.

to probe the mechanism of specific binding and investigate which domain was the most important epitope, the 3-d complex structure of ladr <dig> fv fragment and dr <dig> was constructed using docking method and optimized with molecular mechanism and dynamics methods. the stable complex conformation was shown in figure 3b, and the intact surface between dr5-ladr <dig> was shown in figure 3c, indicating the key residues of dr5: ser <dig>  glu <dig>  phe <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  asp <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  glu <dig>  arg <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig> and thr <dig> 

epitope determination of ladr5
to verify the epitope of dr <dig> identified by ladr <dig>  the expression vectors of dr5wt and its alanine-replaced mutants  were constructed. proteins were obtained from prokaryotic system e.coli bl <dig>  sds-page analysis displayed a single band of each purified protein with the molecular weight of about 19kd . elisa results were showed that mutation of residues 59/62/67/ <dig>  or 96/98/101/ <dig>  in dr <dig> attenuated the dr <dig> binding capacity of trail or ladr <dig> , suggesting those sites key residues of dr <dig> identified by both trail and ladr <dig>  the trail or ladr <dig> binding capacity order of dr5wt and dr <dig> mutants seemed to be dr5m1 > dr5wt > dr5m3 > dr5m <dig>  indicating the importance of residues 59/62/67/ <dig> and 96/98/101/ <dig>  furthermore, for dr5m <dig> almost lose the ability to bind ladr <dig> or trail, residues 59/62/67/ <dig> seemed more important, especially in ladr <dig> reaction, which were consistent with theoretical results predicted by computer-aided analysis. meanwhile, relative affinity constant of ladr <dig> to bind dr <dig> mutants were determined by elisa. as shown in table  <dig>  the order of affinity were dr5m1 > dr5wt > dr5m3 > dr5m <dig>  which were consistent with binding assays. to our surprise, the calculated relative affinity constant of ladr <dig> to bind dr5m <dig> were minus, with the possible reason that the constant approached or quite near zero, which indicated quite low affinity of dr5m <dig> to bind ladr <dig> 

* relative affinity constant was minus, with the possible reason that the constant approached or quite near zero, indicating low affinity of dr5m <dig> to bind ladr <dig> 

the order of affinity were dr5m1 > dr5wt > dr5m3 > dr5m <dig>  which were consistent with elisa results.

besides, the inhibitory activity of dr5wt or its mutants to the cytotoxicity of ladr <dig> or trail in jurkat cells was also carried out. as shown in figure 5a, dr5wt and dr5m <dig> could obviously interfere the cytotoxicity of ladr <dig> in jurkat cells, while dr5m <dig> and dr5m <dig> couldn’t, indicating that only dr5m <dig> and dr5wt could compete with membrane dr <dig> to neutralize ladr <dig> on jurkat cells,therefore residues 59/62/67/ <dig>  or 96/98/101/ <dig>  were predominant sites in ladr <dig> binding, which were consistent with elisa results shown in figure 4b. however, to our surprise, none of dr5wt or its mutants could inhibit the cytotoxicity of trail in jurkat cells .

discussion
dr <dig> and dr <dig> are capable of transducing an apoptosis signal. activation of dr <dig> or/and dr <dig> in various cancer cells triggers programmed cell death through the extrinsic pathway. agents that activate dr <dig> or dr <dig>  including trail, have attracted substantial attention and investment as potential anti-cancer therapies. for trail has no cytotoxicity in many normal cell types except for human liver cells  <cit> , other agonistic reagents against the pro-apoptotic molecules dr <dig> or dr <dig>  such as anti-dr <dig> mabs, became an attractive anti-cancer strategy because of their potential for inducing tumor-specific cell death. human or humanized anti-dr <dig> mabs lexatumumab , apomab, conatumumab  and tigatuzumab  have been identified functional as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or other agents. epitope of apomab resides in residues 62– <dig> and residues 99– <dig> of dr <dig>  which partially overlaps with that of trail binding sites. dr <dig> residues arg <dig>  ser <dig> and lys <dig> seem to be most functional residues, while the nonfunctional anti-dr <dig> antibody bdf <dig> interacts different epitope from apomab  <cit> .

computational approaches and protein structural analysis can provide relevant information about the functional roles of the epitope residues. fast protocols using knowledge-based approaches and distance geometry analysis for predicting binding activity and key functional domains have been established. the physical interactions between antigen and antibody in their complex structures provide crucial insights into antigen function. it is precisely these structures that enable researchers to study interactions in atomic detail, and find out, for example, how a specific mutation in antigen affects its function, or how functional domain formed pharmacophore. here computer-guided models were combined with biological experiments for the efficient determination and identification of the key domain for antigen  in binding with its functional antibody.

thus, in this study, a functional anti-dr <dig> mab, ladr <dig>  was screened out. the apoptosis-inducing and potential anti-tumor activity of ladr <dig> without cross-linking was characterized in vitro. as shown in figure  <dig>  only membrane dr5-positive cell line jurkat died with ladr <dig> obviously in a dose-dependent manner, while dr5-low expression cell line k <dig>  high expression cell line daudi and u <dig> were insensitive to ladr <dig>  furthermore, jurkat cells displayed apoptosis feature when ladr <dig> was added . the dr5-associated disc was investigated by western blot and immunoprecipitation in ladr5-treated jurkat or daudi cell lysates, by which ladr <dig> could induce the recruitment of fadd and then caspase- <dig> activation only in jurkat cells , which was consistent with the cytotoxic and apoptotic results. in daudi cells, fadd-caspase- <dig> signal pathway was not triggered, the reason might be the failure of surface dr <dig> crosslinking by ladr <dig> to form disc or the interference of negative regulating molecules against caspase- <dig> activation   <cit> .

based on the computational methods and protein structural analysis, the key epitope of ladr <dig> was predicted. first, the 3-d modeling structures of ladr <dig> vh and vl were obtained, followed by constructing the 3-d structure of ladr <dig> fv fragment . then using docking method, the 3-d complex structure of ladr <dig> fv fragment and dr <dig>  was constructed and optimized ; meanwhile, the key residues of dr <dig> identified by ladr <dig> was determined theoretically , according to which three dr <dig> mutants were designed and purified to confirm the prediction. the trail or ladr <dig> binding capacity order of dr5wt and dr <dig> mutants seemed to be dr5m1 > dr5wt > dr5m3 > dr5m <dig>  suggesting that residues 59/62/67/ <dig>  and 96/98/101/ <dig>  in dr <dig> were key residues to bind trail or ladr <dig> . furthermore, residues 59/62/67/ <dig>  were more important in ladr <dig> reaction, which were consistent with theoretical results predicted by computer-aided analysis. furthermore, only dr5m <dig> as well as dr5wt could obviously interfere the cytotoxicity of ladr <dig> in jurkat cells, indicating residues 59/62/67/ <dig>  or 96/98/101/ <dig>  were predominant functional sites in the cytotoxic activity of ladr <dig>  as well as in the binding of ladr <dig>  indeed the design procedure of dr5m <dig> was similar as that of the other mutants. the domain  of dr <dig> was the boundary of the binding sites, when the residues mutated in dr5m <dig> were replaced with alanine, the hydrophilic property of the domain was lost and the hydrophobic area was increased, then the change benefited to the binding affinity.

however, to our surprise, none of dr5s could inhibit the cytotoxicity of trail , with the possible reasons we conferred could be as follows: firstly, trail identifies wider binding area of dr <dig> with higher affinity and/or triggers too strong cytotoxic signal to be interfered; secondly, no matter whether trail dissociates or falls off after binding to membrane dr <dig>  when trail starts to bind, the downstream signals are induced immediately resulting in trail-inducing cytotoxicity, although this statement should be supported by further experiments; thirdly, although the binding sites of dr <dig> identified by trail known from the x-ray crystallographic analysis was overlapped by ladr <dig> binding sites, the cytotoxic processes induced by trail should be more than dr5-inducing pathway, for example, trail can trigger cell death through dr <dig> rather than dr <dig>  therefore in trail-dr <dig> inducing cytotoxicity, it was difficult to inhibit downstream apoptosis signals by single dr <dig> analogs, which were more conceivable in our consideration.

CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrated the specific epitope located in dr <dig> that plays a crucial role in antibody binding; furthermore, revealed structural features of ladr5-dr <dig> complex may be beneficial to design or screen novel antineoplastic drugs aganist dr <dig>
