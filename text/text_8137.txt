BACKGROUND
salinity affects about  <dig> million hectares of land worldwide due to excessive irrigation and continues to increase in parallel with the population. salinity in soil and water has caused substantial economic losses, including an estimated $ <dig> million for the indus basin in pakistan and $ <dig> billion for the colorado river basin in the u.s.  <cit> . an estimated total of  <dig> million hectares of new cropland is needed to feed the rapidly expanding population but only  <dig> million hectares are available for expansion and farming of traditional crops  <cit> . attempts have been made with conventional crops to breed salt tolerance; however, these crops can only tolerate limited amounts of salt in their systems. the potential of halophytes, the natural flora of saline habitats, has been under-examined until recently and their utilization may allow production of useful crops on salty soils.

suaeda fruticosa, a succulent shrub in the family chenopodiaceae, is an obligate halophyte that grows optimally at 300 mm nacl and has the adaptation to reduce sodium buildup for long term survival  <cit> . this perennial halophyte has a strong ability to accumulate and sequester na+ and cl− without the aid of salt glands, bladder or trichomes  <cit> . it is a good source of high quality edible oil  <cit> , has potential for antiophthalmic, hypolipidaemic and hypoglycemic medicinal purposes  <cit> , and has economic usage as forage for animals  <cit> . s. fruticosa also could help in bioremediation and reclamation of soils contaminated with toxic metals  <cit>  and salinity  <cit> . field studies showed that this plant can remove about 2646 kg of nacl per hectare from the soil each year  <cit> . at optimum  salt treatment of this species antioxidant enzymes trigger stress response through the activation of h2o2− mediated ca2+ uptake to maintain na+ homeostasis at the cellular or tissue level  <cit> . calcium ions, responsible for the overall signaling network of growth and development of the plant, are accumulated in the cell cytosol with the increase of na+  <cit> . at higher salinities, a significant reduction in growth is prevalent which might be due to the maximum threshold of the plant’s ability to adjust to specific ion toxicity and osmotic capability. physiological data analysis has led to reports of ion accumulation, osmotic adjustments, maintenance of pressure potential and growth and production of glycinebetaine as part of a salt tolerance mechanism  <cit> . previous studies of the impact of salinity on s. fruticosa have linked salt tolerance to its ability to uptake k+ in order to maintain a higher k+/na+ ratio in the shoots. higher sequestration of sodium and chloride in the shoot vacuoles together with the ability to synthesize osmoprotectants such as glycinebetaine has been suggested to maintain a favorable water potential gradient and protect cellular structures. similar to suaeda fruticosa, the majority of halophytes do not have glands or external bladders to modulate their tissue ion concentration therefore it has been seen to be a good model genus for the study of salt tolerance  <cit> .

next generation sequencing allows differential gene expression analysis of gene alleles and spliced transcripts, non-coding rna and others, which will lead to identification of differentially expressed and/or unique genes. in this transcriptome paper, we report the identification of genes that are induced or repressed in plants grown under optimal salt conditions in comparison to low salt conditions. we generated a data set of transcript sequences from the roots and the shoots of suaeda fruticosa. the genes were compared for differential expression under the indicated treatments using the assembled transcriptome, and common and tissue-specific patterns of transcriptomic responses were also analyzed. this first transcriptome study of suaeda fruticosa expands our knowledge on global gene expression data for salt-accumulating halophytes that do not have external bladders.

RESULTS
de novo transcriptome assembly and assessments of expressed sequenced tags
experimental design
to prepare for the transcriptome assembly and analysis, total rna was extracted from shoots and roots of suaeda fruticosa. these include biological triplicates of cdna libraries for s. fruticosa roots from plants grown without salt , roots with 300 mm optimal salt , shoots with no salt  and shoots with 300 mm optimal salt . total mrna was purified using oligo dt and transcribed into cdna libraries using truseq rna sample prep kit for illumina 100 bp paired-end sequencing.

sequencing method and quality assessment of the reads
a total of  <dig>  million reads of 100 bp were generated by illumina hi-seq platform . the reads were filtered using trimmomatic to remove adapters, fastx toolkit and sickle program to remove low quality reads and discard reads based upon the threshold of length. a total of  <dig> % of the reads were trimmed and filtered totaling to  <dig> , <dig> reads.

to normalize and assemble rna-seq reads for de novo assembly, digital normalization was used for  <dig>  million reads. k-mer hash of  <dig> with coverage of 30x was built from a set of reads to correct redundancy issues, variations in sequences, and potential errors among the reads. since some reads with sequencing errors may escape quality score-based filtering steps, the reads with potential errors are flagged for removal from the dataset to improve the de novo assembly. sequencing errors can affect the assembly algorithms so it is best to eliminate the reads that have non-uniform k-mer coverage. reads that have non-uniform k-mer coverage create a problem with the assembly therefore it is necessary to normalize the reads to a certain threshold. this threshold represents the approximate minimum for de novo assembly to work optimally and efficiently. digital normalization  <cit>  was applied to the total of  <dig> , <dig> paired end reads with k-mer size of  <dig> and k-mer coverage cutoff of 30x. the retained reads were normalized to  <dig> , <dig>  to remove overabundant reads, reduce noise of the sequenced sample and decrease the overall percentage of errors . the effect of digital normalization is to retain nearly all real k-mers while discarding the majority of erroneous and redundant k-mers. this step allows reducing the reads and obtaining a transcriptome assembly much faster than and superior to the assembly based on the full data set without affecting the quality of the assembly. because the genes in the transcriptome have different levels of expression, k-mer distribution will not show any peak at any k value.table  <dig>

to assemble the suaeda fruticosa transcriptome we utilized a genome-independent reconstruction approach. the strategy involved building a de bruijn graph made of overlapping subsequences or k-mers using velvet  <cit> . the overlapping bases allow building a graph of all the sequences that then traverse a path guided by read and paired-end coverage  <cit> . the path through the graph is reported as transcripts. to assemble the contigs into scaffolds, we used a de bruijn graph software, oases  <cit> . k-mer sizes from  <dig> to  <dig> were chosen to generate the assemblies. we assessed the quality of the assemblies based on the total number of transcripts, open reading frames predicted using transdecoder and highest mapping percentage of the reads using gsnap. the number of sequences, n <dig> values, mean length of the sequences and total base pair length for the contigs, scaffolds and unigenes were also determined . among the individual k-mer values, transcript numbers associated with different k-mer values vary from  <dig> to  <dig> . k-mer length is related inversely to the number of transcripts generated. the highest n <dig>  generated for the transcripts is  <dig>  generated by a k-mer length of  <dig>  predicted open reading frames range from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp with the highest number of orfs being generated with a k-mer of  <dig>  the highest n <dig> for open reading frames belongs to an assembly with a k-mer of  <dig> with  <dig>  bp. mapping coverage for the assemblies range from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the highest percentage of reads mapping back to the assembly belongs to assemblies with k-mers  <dig> and  <dig> with  <dig> % and  <dig> % mapped. assembly k- <dig> contains a higher percentage of proper pairs aligned with  <dig> % and higher n <dig> compared to assembly k- <dig>  therefore it was chosen to be the assembly for the succeeding steps.

assembly k- <dig> contained  <dig>  contigs from velvet with a n <dig> length of 1548 bp and mean size of 928 bp. we selected contigs that were greater than 200 bp in length. the contigs were assembled into scaffolds using oases and yielded  <dig>  contigs with an n <dig> length of 1669 bp and mean size of 1012 bp. the shortest scaffold is 152 bp and the longest one is  <dig>  bp. using cdhit-est, scaffold sequences were assembled into clusters and transdecoder was used to predict open reading frames. the sequences were further screened for adapter and vector contamination using ncbi vecscreen and the univec database. those sequences that are longer than 200 bp were kept. using this pipeline, we obtained  <dig>  high-quality unigenes with an n <dig> of 957 bp. the size range of the unigenes is between  <dig> to 6639 bp. there are  <dig>  unigenes comprising  <dig> % of the total that have lengths of more than 1000 bp. the mean size of the unigenes is 763 bp .table  <dig>

functional annotation, gene ontology assignments and analysis
the unigenes assembled were used as query for annotation using blastx searches based on sequence homologies to the databases of the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant  protein database, refseq, swissprot uniprot and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  using blast2go. the summary of top hit distribution similar to suaeda fruticosa unigenes is illustrated in figure 2a. the species distribution with the lowest e-value matching the best sequence alignment result showed that the s. fruticosa transcriptome sequences have  <dig> unigenes  matching to vitis vinifera ,  <dig> unigenes  matching to theobroma cacao  and  <dig> unigenes  similar to beta vulgaris . the closest halophyte species matching with suaeda fruticosa is populus trichocarpa  with  <dig> unigenes . for poplar only the initial analysis of the draft genome has been completed; additional mapping and sequencing is ongoing. some of the halophytes mentioned in this paper do not have full annotation of genes submitted to ncbi database and some only contain partial transcriptome information. figure 2b summarizes the data distribution summary from the sequences from the assembled transcriptome.figure  <dig> top hit distribution of matched unigenes among different species generated from blastx. . data distribution summary from blast2go shows blast hits, mapping results and annotated sequences .



gene names and go terms were assigned to the transcripts based on homologies with an e-value threshold of 10- <dig>  the data distribution summary for these sequences is shown in figure 2b. annotated sequences utilize assigned functional terms to query sequences from go terms based on the gene ontology vocabulary. mapped sequences are those with retrieved go terms associated with the hits obtained after a blast search. the search produced  <dig>  annotated sequences among  <dig>  total transcripts, comprising  <dig> % of total sequences. there are  <dig> sequences comprising  <dig> % of the total transcripts that did not surpass the annotation threshold and  <dig> sequences or  <dig> % had hits in the databases but lack functional information. a large proportion has no significant sequence alignment or hits in any of the databases, comprising  <dig>  sequences or  <dig> % of total transcripts which suggests that they may contain novel sequences or a high number of suaeda fruticosa specific transcripts or transcript portions such as orphan untranslated regions.

gene ontology encompasses a dynamic library for gene and protein roles in cells. this includes three main categories: biological process, referring to the biological objective of the genes or gene products; molecular function, defined by the biochemical activity of the genes or gene products; and cellular components, referring to the place in the cell where the gene product is active  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates the gene ontology annotation of the total assembled unigenes from the de novo assembled transcriptome of suaeda fruticosa using blast2go.figure  <dig> gene ontology summary of total assembled ests using blast2go. distribution of gene ontology annotation of suaeda fruticosa transcriptome. the results are summarized as follows:  biological process, . cellular component  molecular function.



in the biological process category, genes related to stress make up  <dig> of the total unigenes annotated . the other dominant subcategories were protein modification , structural development  and dna metabolic process . the following subcategories include unigenes involved in carbohydrate metabolism , nucleobase-containing compound catabolic process , organelle organization , reproduction , ribosome biogenesis , signal transduction , single organism development , translation , transmembrane transport , lipid metabolism , cofactor metabolism , and cellular amino acid metabolism . figure 3b illustrates the cellular component category, which has a dominant subcategory of plastid , plasma membrane  and protein complex . the molecular function category was comprised of protein coding genes involved in ion binding , oxidoreductase , and those responsible for redox reactions of the cell and kinases  . these gene ontology annotations represent a profile for gene expression of suaeda fruticosa suggesting that this species has diverse protein coding genes comprising its structural, regulatory, metabolic and stress response mechanisms.

differential expression analysis
to acquire counts data for differential expression analysis, samples of different treatments  were mapped to the newly generated reference transcriptome using gsnap  which utilizes computational methods to detect variants and splicing isoforms in short reads through merging and filtering position lists from a genomic index. it also detects short and long-distance splicing including interchromosomal splicing using probability models or a database of known splice sites  <cit> . conversion of bam files into count data was performed using bambam  <cit>  to summarize the number of reads mapped to each annotated feature. differential expression calls were made using the edger package. normalization is applied to the treatments and tissue types to provide accurate differential expression rather than individual quantification. the edger package adjusted the analysis taking into account sequencing depths represented by library sizes. variations between biological replicates were clustered closely using a multidimensional scaling  plot similar to that shown in figure  <dig> to check for variations among replicates and samples.figure  <dig> multidimensional scaling plot for the sequencing libraries. multidimensional scaling plot  is designed to indicate sample relationship similarity. shoots and roots of 0 mm and 300 mm nacl with their biological replicates are analyzed. ).



the replicates of treatments and their tissue types from transcriptome analysis were used to produce a multidimensional scaling plot , which allows us to see a spatial configuration of how similar or dissimilar the different treatments and biological replicates of s. fruticosa shoot and root samples are. the relationship of shoot treatments is more closely clustered together in comparison to root treatments. the tight clustering of the shoot data points means there are fewer variations among biological replicates in comparison to the root treatments. root samples, however, have greater variations among the treatments and their biological replicates. this indicates that root tissues show less consistency with expression of genes among treatments. common dispersions were then estimated on the distributions of reads across genes. each gene gets an assignment of a unique dispersion estimate, which is to be compared to a common dispersion. the biological coefficients of variation versus the abundance were plotted . this specifies relative abundance of each gene variation between rna samples and also measurement error estimated by the sequencing technology. from this sample, it shows a common dispersion of  <dig>  and bcv of  <dig> %. this means that common variation shows overall variability across the genome for this dataset and the common variation square root indicates high coefficient of biological variation. the genewise dispersions show a decrease at low average log counts per million. it indicates that at low expression level of genes or transcripts, the variability of gene abundance is high.figure  <dig> biological coefficient of variation plot. genewise dispersion plot for twelve libraries is indicated. estimation of genewise bcv allows observation of changes for genes that are consistent between biological replicates and giving less priority to those with inconsistent results. generalized linear model is used to determine the evidence of significant difference of counts for a transcript or exon across conditions. the bh method is used in this dataset to control false discovery rate.



the analyses were concentrated on genes that are significantly different in expression levels in the optimum salt transcriptome as compared to the low condition transcriptome. genes whose adjusted p-values were less than  <dig>  using the bh method were considered differentially expressed  <cit> . the bh method known also as fdr  by benjamini, hochberg, and yekutieli enables the user to control the false discovery rate, the expected proportion of false discoveries amongst the rejected hypotheses. the false discovery rate is a less stringent condition than the family-wise error rate, so these methods are more powerful than the others. rna-seq gene expression for suaeda fruticosa is visualized as an ma plot  in figure  <dig>  the red dots highlight transcripts that are differentially expressed among biological replicates and treatments. there are  <dig> genes that are downregulated and  <dig> genes are upregulated with a p-value < <dig>  and false discovery rate < <dig> . the results are consistent with the physiological data of suaeda fruticosa  <cit>  where at 0 mm nacl treatment, more genes are downregulated in comparison to optimal growth of 300 mm nacl.figure  <dig> differential expression genes plot. plot of logfcs against average count size, highlighting the differentially expressed genes in red. from the samples and the replicates, there are  <dig> genes identified to be downregulated and  <dig> genes that are upregulated with p-value of < <dig>  and fdr rate of < <dig> .



gene annotation and identification of differentially expressed genes
the differentially expressed genes were annotated using blast2go software against ncbi non-redundant protein database with a cut-off e-value of 10- <dig>  enrichment analysis was performed for the biological functions of the identified degs. among  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes,  <dig> of them are upregulated upon salt treatment and  <dig> are downregulated. these genes were identified from blast nr, swissprot and uniprot databases and assigned with gene ontology terms in biological process, molecular function and cellular component categories.

the top hit species distribution of these differentially expressed genes included grapes  with  <dig> unigenes, orange  with  <dig> unigenes, and theobroma cacao with  <dig> genes. the closest halophyte is populus trichocarpa with  <dig> unigenes and mesembryanthemum crystallinum with  <dig> unigenes. draft genome projects for both p. trichocarpa and m. crystallinum are currently ongoing while other halophytes only have partial transcriptome information available in the ncbi database.

from  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig> unigenes have significant blast hits  and the remaining 25% do not have any significant sequence alignments, which suggests that they might be genes that are novel or have not been reported in any other plant databases. there were  <dig> annotated sequences , and  <dig> have interproscan matches from the european bioinformatics institute  that can be mapped to go terms and annotations while  <dig> of them have been assigned to gene ontology ids. the summary in figure  <dig> shows how many genes are assigned to at least one go term and grouped into three main go categories: biological processes , cellular component , and molecular function . direct go terms from blast2go were performed by counting annotated sequences in each term and suggesting the top terms. among these sequences,  <dig> total unigenes are identified in the molecular function category of go annotation. the top hits included genes functioning in ion binding , kinase activity  and dna binding . in the cellular component category, the top hits are genes found to be active in the nucleus , protein complex component  and plasma membrane . for the biological process category,  <dig> unigenes have been assigned with go terms and go ids. there are  <dig> unigenes that are important in biosynthetic process,  <dig> unigenes responding to stress and  <dig> unigenes involved in cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process. the differentially expressed genes were assigned to kegg to identify pathways that these genes might be involved in related to salt tolerance. among the annotated differentially expressed unigenes, the top hit included  <dig> sequences that are involved in both nitrogen and histidine metabolism. others function in lysine degradation, glycerolipid metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism. other pathways are illustrated in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig> summary of differentially expressed ests using blast2go. differentially expressed transcripts were classified into  <dig> main go annotations: biological processes , cellular component  and molecular functions . there are  <dig> go terms for biological processes,  <dig> go for molecular function and  <dig> go for cellular component. a majority assigns the go from biological process as stress response genes, genes responsible for oxidation-reduction and structure development. a few transcripts reflect oxidoreductase and kinase activity for molecular function. a majority of the transcripts is distributed to the nucleus and plasma membrane.



relative gene expression validation using qrtpcr analysis of rna from 0 mm and 300 mm samples
to validate the results from the transcriptome analysis, we selected seven differentially expressed genes with putative functions related to salt tolerance. specific primers were designed and optimized using pcr for the selected de genes and for alpha tubulin as the endogenous control . we amplified a cdna library from six samples of 0 mm treated plants and six 300 mm treated samples. analysis of transcript levels by qrtpcr showed that expression for all seven gene targets selected correspond with the differential expression patterns determined from the transcriptome analysis. four targets  show upregulation of mrna expression while the other three targets  4–1) show downregulation upon 300 mm nacl treatment compared to the absence of salt treatment .figure  <dig> qrtpcr validation of the transcriptome data. each panel shows the qrtpcr results for seven test genes. the annotated putative genes are listed on the x-axis and the mean fold change represented by the 2-ΔΔct method relative to 0 mm treated samples are shown on the y axis. error bars depict the standard error of the mean for  <dig> biological replicates. significant differences  are denoted with an asterisk and highly significant differences with p-value of < <dig>  are represented with double asterisks.



putative salt tolerance-related genes
blast analysis data identified a large number of differentially expressed genes and we have grouped them in the following categories:  <dig>  genes responsible for enzymes, transcription factors, hormones, photosynthetic genes, detoxifiers and osmolytes for general metabolism,  <dig>  genes functioning as transporters for water and ion uptake,  <dig>  genes involved in regulation such as kinases and phosphatases, and  <dig>  genes that function to protect the cells against abiotic stress such as late embryogenesis abundant protein, heat shock proteins, osmoprotectants such as dehydrins and osmotins. the number of transcripts reported to be differentially regulated or expressed depends on the conditions being compared. in this study, we are comparing transcript expression between  <dig> and 300 mm nacl treatment and their biological replicates. upregulated genes are those with significant increased expression when treated with salt . those downregulated are annotated sequences with decreased expression with salt treatment. a summary of these sequences, their definitions and putative functions, and references from other halophytes or plants is shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

general metabolism genes
genes that are involved in transcription, translation and post-translational modification have been seen to play roles in salt tolerance processes. wrky transcription factors are important regulators for signaling mechanisms that modulate various plant processes. it has been found to interact with protein partners, map kinases, calmodulin, histone deacetylases, resistance proteins for autoregulation and transcriptional reprogramming  <cit> . it has also been suggested to be crucial for salinity tolerance  <cit> . from the differential expression analysis of the transcriptome, we have found wrky transcription factor  <dig> to be significantly upregulated while wrky transcription factor 6-like and wrky dna-binding protein isoform  <dig> are downregulated. the salt tolerant grass festuca rubra ssp litoralis was found to have a differentially regulated wrky-type transcription factor in response to salinity  <cit> . transient expression studies have also found oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> to be activators of aba signaling but repressors of gibberelic acid signaling in aleurone cells  <cit> . moreover, in arabidopsis, atwrky <dig> negatively autoregulates its own promoter to influence senescence and pathogen defense-associated pr <dig> promoter activity. this targets sirk, a gene encoding a receptor-like protein kinase that is strongly induced during leaf senescence. the activation of sirk is dependent on wrky <dig> function  <cit> . these studies suggest that wrky <dig> trancription factor is upregulated to respond to aba signaling, important for stress tolerance while downregulating protein-coding genes involved in senescence for protection and defense. gibberelic acid  genes, which regulate many aspects of growth and development of plants, are involved in the synthesis of gibberellin hormone. in arabidopsis, reduction of bioactive ga is shown via an increase in gibberellin 2-oxidase  <dig> . this leads to accumulation of della proteins, which are transcriptional regulators that repress ga-responsive growth and development, inhibiting plant growth  <cit> . downregulation of ga2ox <dig> is observed at 300 mm salt treatment in suaeda fruticosa. this suggests that the decrease deactivates bioactive ga  <cit> . ga genes were regulated at 200 mm nacl in s. europaea similar to homologues of gibberellin 3-oxidase and gibberellin 20-oxidase in p. trichocarpa. two della domain gras family transcription factors were downregulated in plants treated with 200 mm salt  <cit> .

both 40s ribosomal protein s <dig> and 60s ribosomal protein l18-2-like that are upregulated in s. fruticosa are part of a group of srp-dependent co-translational proteins targeting to membranes responsible for translation and protein binding  <cit> . ribosomal protein 40s and 60s and rna binding family protein are also highly upregulated in this transcriptome study. similar studies were performed in poplar euphratica, which found that ribosomal 60s rrna, important for plastidic and nuclear protein synthesis, is increased in response to salinity  <cit> . 60s acidic ribosomal protein p <dig>  known to play an important role in the elongation step of protein synthesis and other rna-binding family proteins are upregulated in 300 mm nacl treated suaeda fruticosa. however, the gene encoding pre-mrna processing protein 40c undergoes downregulation in salt treated plants. this protein has been found to be a coactivator involved in regulated transcription of rna polymerase ii-dependent genes important in transcription and other regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . some dna binding proteins also show concerted regulation upon salt treatment. dna-binding escarola-like protein responsible for late flowering and leaf development and f-box kelch repeat protein at1g80440-like are upregulated while mads-box transcription factor agl <dig>  an early target of transcriptional repression at floral transitional stage, dna-binding protein with zinc finger isoform <dig> and f-box protein at1g78280-like transferase involved in regulation of transcription are downregulated.

an increase in reactive oxygen species causing damage to cellular components is evident when salinity increases. genes that are responsible in regulating redox reactions are usually involved in protecting the cell environment during these stresses  <cit> . upregulation of glutathione-s-transferase tau  <dig>  and glutathione transferase were seen in the differential expression analysis of s. fruticosa. similarly, glutathione s-transferases were greatly increased upon salt treatment in roots of the halophyte salicornia europaea  <cit> , suaeda maritima and reaumuria trigyna  <cit> . the suaeda salsa gst gene was introduced into arabidopsis and improved salt tolerance after overexpression in transgenic plants. glutathione content increased in salt-stressed arabidopsis and promoted a higher level of salt tolerance  <cit> . the level of glutathione is increased at 0 mm and 900 mm treatment and decreased at the optimal condition of 300 mm nacl in s. fruticosa  <cit> .

a similar trend of higher salt tolerance is seen in tobacco seedlings upon overexpression of gst and these genes have been found to be responsible for increased protection against toxins  <cit> . some proteins important for seed production and growth show differential expression in s. fruticosa. germin-like protein, found to be an important plant marker for salt stress regulation and suggested to undergo change when salt-tolerant plants are subjected to salt stress has been found to be significantly upregulated upon salt treatment  <cit> . an ortholog of flowering promoting factor 1-like protein  <dig>  which promotes flowering in arabidopsis, and auxin-induced protein 5ng4-like gene involved in transport of molecules functioning downstream of the auxin response and responsible for root formation are also upregulated  <cit> . some genes encoding proteins involved in protection such as pathogenesis-related protein, chitinase, peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase , and plant cadmium resistance 2-like are also increased. plant chitinase plays an important role in plant defense and enhances resistance and tolerance to heat, salt and drought  <cit> . overexpression of chitinases in transgenic tobacco has been shown to enhance biotic and abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . in tobacco cells, apx functions in the regeneration of nad+ and is usually induced by high temperature stress and functions against toxic reactive oxygen species  <cit> . in the halophyte atriplex halimus l., chloride salinity reduces cadmium accumulation as salinity resistance is found to be closely associated with the gene loci responsible for cadmium extraction  <cit> . proteins containing chaperone domains and dnaj- <dig> like chaperon protein are also decreased upon salt treatment. the dnaj protein family is included in the group of heat shock proteins functioning as molecular chaperones, and is associated with hsp <dig> and involved in resisting environmental stresses in suaeda maritima  <cit> . specifically dna-j <dig> in arabidopsis is encoded by the gene known as altered response to gravity  <dig> , and mediates gravity signal transduction and hypocotyl gravitropism  <cit> . other genes that are downregulated include ethylene-responsive transcription factor rap2– <dig> like isoform, senescence-associated protein, stem specific protein tsjt1-like, root hair protein f3h11– <dig>  cell wall protein awa1-like isoform x <dig> for cell wall organization, and callose synthase  <dig>  a major component of pollen tubes and pollen cell walls. molecular mechanisms of cellular calcium changes have been seen with the downregulation of calcineurin b-like protein  and calmodulin binding isoform  <dig> upon salt treatment suggesting their potential role as regulators of salt and drought responses  <cit> . calmodulin mediates auxin signaling and responds to stresses in arabidopsis  <cit> . cbl interacts with cipk serine-threonine protein kinases and mediates activation of akt <dig> in response to low potassium conditions and stomatal movement  <cit> .

ion transporters 
homeostasis of the cellular environment involves the maintenance of cellular uptake to control ionic balance. since a large influx of extracellular na + occurs in halophytes, plants require high amounts of k+  to lower the amount of na + and maintain osmosis  <cit> . aquaporin tonoplast intrinsic proteins showed upregulation in salt treated s. fruticosa. aquaporins are membrane proteins that facilitate uptake of soil water and mediate regulation of root hydraulic conductivity. they are also involved in compartmentalization of water and are found in halophytes to play a role in maintaining osmosis and turgor of plant cells  <cit> . the halophyte schrenkiella parvulla contains high numbers of aquaporins for tolerance to boron toxicity  <cit> . in poplar species, some aquaporins are decreased to prevent water loss during salt stress  <cit> . some other transporters that are upregulated upon salt treatment include high-affinity nitrate transporter  <dig> -like and nitrate transporter  <dig>  important for nitrate uptake, aluminum-activated malate transporter  <dig> for increased aluminum tolerance, flavonol 4-sulfotransferase for auxin transport, bidirectional sugar transporters and glucosyltransferase for glucose and other sugar transport, seed storage/lipid transfer protein responsible for metabolism and transport, and atpase subunit  <dig>  other halophytes such as schrenkiella parvula and thellungiella showed upregulation of genes encoding for atpases that are necessary for large influx of ions  <cit> .

lea genes
late embryogenesis abundant  proteins comprise a group of proteins that have crucial roles in cellular dehydration tolerance. they have been associated with tolerance to dehydration caused by freezing, salinity or drying. during stress conditions such as salinity, plant hormone abscisic acid  is produced to develop tolerance against drought. some genes are induced to trigger the production of aba  <cit> .

overexpression of lea proteins can improve stress tolerance of transgenic plants  <cit> . in this transcriptome study, salt treatment causes upregulation of dehydration-responsive rd22-like protein. rd <dig> expression in arabidopsis is mediated by abscisic acid . this is also induced by salt stress and dehydration  <cit>  and is expressed during early and middle stages of seed development. housekeeping gene hsp <dig> chaperone superfamily is found to be downregulated upon salt treatment. hsp <dig> family has been associated with the most stress-general expression pattern including salt stress in arabidopsis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides an overview of the genes present in a non-model plant species and identifies the genes associated with salt tolerance. the assembled transcriptome was used for differential expression studies and gene annotations. we have identified  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed based on p-value and adjusted false discovery rate of less than  <dig> . the same pattern of differential expression for seven of these genes was confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis, which each showed similar levels of up- or down-regulation .

the annotation of genes using next generation sequencing is more readily available through the advancement of technology. analysis of predicted genes allows assumptions to be made on the complexity of genetic mechanisms for this plant. rna sequencing generates an enormous amount of data in terms of identifying the transcripts, however the challenges remain with the analysis. one of the major problems is the development of expression metrics that will allow comparisons of different expression levels and also provide identification of differentially expressed genes. we have utilized a combination of approaches to conduct this analysis for the suaeda fruticosa transcriptome. the reference transcriptome assembly was not previously available and this species does not have any close relative plant that can serve as a basis for the expression analysis.

this study reports comprehensive information about the transcriptome of the succulent halophyte s. fruticosa. this will provide a basis for further study of the mechanism of salt tolerance, discovery of novel genes involved and comparison of expression profiles with no salt and optimal salt concentration. the de novo transcriptome generated in this study provides a useful source of reference sequence for succulent halophytes.
