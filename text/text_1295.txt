BACKGROUND
photosynthetic plant life is exposed to potentially damaging uv-b radiation  which is intrinsic to sunlight. uv-b photons are specifically and sensitively detected in plants by the uv-b photoreceptor uv resistance locus  <dig>  . uvr8-mediated signalling is known to culminate in altered expression of a broad range of genes  <cit>  which ultimately leads to uv-b acclimation and uv-b tolerance. uvr <dig> uv-b signalling involves the interaction of uvr <dig> with the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase constitutively photomorphogenic  <dig>  and associated stabilization of the bzip transcription factor elongated hypocotyl  <dig>  . hy <dig> then influences expression of a number of uv-b regulated genes  <cit> , including expression of hy <dig> itself  <cit> . indeed, a t/g-box cis-regulatory element within the hy <dig> promoter functions as an hy <dig> binding site and is required for uv-b-induced hy <dig> expression  <cit> .

apart from hy <dig> stabilization, past reports have proposed a more direct mechanism of uvr <dig> regulation of uv-b-dependent transcription. uvr <dig> has sequence similarity to the eukaryotic guanine nucleotide exchange factor regulator of chromatin condensation , which interacts with chromatin and specifically with histones  <cit> . rcc <dig> proteins act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors  and regulate the small gtpase ran. rcc <dig> is essential to critical cellular processes in eukaryotes such as nucleocytoplasmic transport, nuclear envelope formation, and spindle assembly during mitosis . although uvr <dig> is not otherwise functionally related to rcc <dig>  chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays have suggested that uvr <dig> binds chromatin in vivo . it is tempting to assume that uvr <dig> chromatin association is due to structural similarity with rcc <dig> proteins. recent studies of rcc <dig> structure illustrate how this protein interacts with histone and dna components of the nucleosome  <cit> . rcc <dig> is a β-propeller protein that interacts with histones and nucleosomal dna through a ‘switchback loop’ region and its n-terminal tail  <cit> . rcc <dig> and histones make contact through the h2a-h2b histone dimer surface of the nucleosome core particle whilst contacts between rcc <dig> and dna are made through the dna phosphate backbone. this indicates that rcc <dig> interacts with chromatin by binding non-dna-sequence specific areas  <cit> . consistently, the yeast rcc1-orthologue srm1/prp <dig> was found to bind most nucleosomes in the genome with no apparent sequence specificity  <cit> .

similar unspecific binding was indicated for arabidopsis uvr <dig> by reports of its association with a region larger than 3 kb around the hy <dig> genomic locus and its chromatin association via histones, preferentially histone h2b  <cit> . however, in contrast to the yeast rcc <dig>  the proposed uvr <dig> chromatin association was confined to specific genes. of the promoter regions tested, uvr <dig> was found to interact with chromatin of some  but not all  uvr8-regulated genes  <cit> . however, both the specificity of uvr <dig> for particular target genes and the mechanism conferring specificity need to be more firmly established.

association of arabidopsis uvr <dig> with chromatin of uvr <dig> target genes was reported to be constitutive and not uv-b-responsive  <cit> , despite the fact that uvr <dig> accumulates in the nucleus upon uv-b irradiation  <cit> . thus, independent of the ambiguities surrounding target gene specificity, it is also a valid question whether uvr <dig> chromatin association indeed underlies uvr <dig> involvement in transcription regulation and, if so, how uvr <dig> influences gene expression mechanistically. it has been suggested that uvr <dig> is involved in the recruitment of transcriptional regulators and/or in chromatin remodelling  <cit> .

here, we have experimentally revisited chromatin association of uvr <dig> and suggest that a mode-of-action involving direct uvr <dig> chromatin association should be considered with caution and alternative mechanisms should not be dismissed.

RESULTS
arabidopsis uvr <dig> does not associate with promoter regions of hy <dig> and myb <dig> target genes in quantitative chip qrt-pcr assays
to better understand the dynamics and role of the proposed uvr <dig> chromatin association, we set out to establish whether uvr <dig> physically interacted with chromatin at previously described target genes using quantitative chip qrt-pcr. we first tested association of endogenous uvr <dig> with the hy <dig> genomic locus using several target regions for which positive qualitative gel-based chip has been described  <cit>  . our anti-uvr <dig> antibody was raised against the same peptide  used in previous chip experiments  <cit> . this antibody is highly efficient and specific both in western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation of uvr <dig> with endogenous cop <dig>  <cit> . to ensure adequate crosslinking conditions and a functional chip protocol, we used the same cross-linked chromatin pool to perform chip of hy <dig> using an anti-hy <dig> antibody and processed the samples in parallel to those arising from uvr <dig> chip.fig.  <dig> uvr <dig> does not associate with the hy <dig> genomic region. a schematic representation of the hy <dig> genomic locus and surrounding region. black and grey boxes depict the hy <dig> transcribed region  and portions of the transcribed regions of the neighbouring genes, respectively. upper grey bars indicate qrt-pcr amplicons at various positions at and surrounding the hy <dig> genomic locus with numbers indicating the position of the 5’ end of the amplicon relative to the hy <dig> translation start site . an arrow indicates the position of the t/g-box cis-element bound by hy <dig>  <cit> . open bars are placed at genomic regions previously reported to be uvr <dig> binding targets in gel-based chip assays  <cit> . b, c chip-qpcr of dna associated with hy <dig>  and uvr <dig>  presented as the percentage of total input dna recovered by immunoprecipitation . the same chromatin pool was used for immunoprecipitation with both hy <dig> and uvr <dig> antibodies. wt = ws/pro

hy <dig> chip clearly confirmed binding of hy <dig> to its own promoter , as has been previously documented  <cit> . however, in contrast to previous reports , we did not detect uvr <dig> chromatin association with hy <dig> using the anti-uvr <dig> antibody in conjuction with several different probes covering a large portion of the hy <dig> genomic region , including those regions previously reported to be bound by uvr <dig>  similar to wild type, we also did not detect uvr <dig> chromatin association with hy <dig> in a transgenic line overexpressing uvr <dig> .

to ensure comparable antibody functionality during immunoprecipitation, we performed further chip qrt-pcr assays and used the exact same antibody for both hy <dig> and uvr <dig>  for this, we resorted to the pro35s:yfp-uvr <dig>  pro35s:cfp-uvr <dig> and pro35s:hy5-yfp transgenic lines and used a polyclonal gfp  antibody to perform chips of hy5-yfp and yfp-uvr <dig> or cfp-uvr <dig> in parallel . in agreement with our hy <dig> chip data, we obtained a clear signal for hy5-yfp binding to the endogenous hy <dig> promoter . however, as for uvr <dig> chip, we did not detect any specific hy <dig> signal above background in yfp-uvr <dig> and cfp-uvr <dig> chip assays, a result that was mirrored in the non-transgenic negative controls  .

to verify that yfp-uvr <dig>  cfp-uvr <dig> and hy5-yfp were efficiently immunoprecipitated with the anti-gfp antibody during the chip procedure, we analysed the protein-chromatin eluate by western blotting. following the immunoprecipitation step, we found yfp-uvr <dig> and cfp-uvr <dig> in the eluate and at positions in agreement with their expected size of 74 kda  . hy5-yfp was detectable in the input and ip fractions  although it ran slightly higher than its predicted molecular weight of 45 kda . however, a similar size discrepancy has been observed previously   <cit> . it is of note that tagged uvr <dig> proteins were expressed and immunoprecipitated at higher levels than hy5-yfp, and yet, unlike hy5-yfp, yfp-uvr <dig> and cfp-uvr <dig> chip assays did not result in hy <dig> chip signal .

we further tested uvr <dig> binding to the promoter of myb <dig>  which is also a reported target gene of uvr <dig>  <cit>  and compared genomic association to that of hy <dig>  <cit> . the primer pair used to detect the myb <dig> promoter amplifies a region that is included in the region amplified with a primer pair used previously  <cit> . however, as for the hy <dig> target gene, we did not detect binding of uvr <dig>  yfp-uvr <dig> or cfp-uvr <dig> to the myb <dig> promoter region above background chip signal for a non-uv-b regulated gene  and a control intergenic region . in contrast, clear myb <dig> chip signal resulted from both chip of hy <dig>  performed in parallel using an anti-hy <dig> antibody on the same cross-linked wild-type chromatin pool , and chip of hy5-yfp, performed with the same gfp antibody in transgenic lines . indeed, uv-b enhanced the association of hy <dig> with the myb <dig> promoter region , as described before  <cit> .fig.  <dig> uvr <dig> does not bind to the myb <dig> promoter. a uvr <dig> chromatin association in wild-type plants , a uvr <dig> mutant  and a uvr8-overexpression line . chip-qpcr was performed using an anti-uvr <dig> antibody for immunoprecipitation. b chromatin association in hy5-yfp expressing plants , a yfp-uvr <dig> line  and hy5- <dig> and uvr8- <dig> mutant controls. chip-qpcr was performed using an anti-gfp antibody for immunoprecipitation. c hy <dig> chromatin association in wild-type plants , a uvr <dig> overexpression line  and hy <dig> hyh mutant control . chip-qpcr was performed using an anti-hy <dig> antibody. a, b, c chromatin association was analysed by chip-qpcr for the myb <dig> promoter , actin <dig> and an intergenic control region between the at4g <dig> and at4g <dig> genes. the analysed chromatin was the same as in the experiments presented in fig.  <dig>  error bars represent sds of three technical replicates



taken together, the results of our quantitative chip qrt-pcr assays of endogenous uvr <dig> and transgenically expressed yfp-uvr <dig> and cfp-uvr <dig> do not support an association of uvr <dig> with previously reported chromatin regions. however, it cannot be excluded that differences in plant growth conditions or chip procedure may explain the discrepancy between our and previously published results. independent of this, a functional role of uvr <dig> at the chromatin level needs to be reconsidered.

vp16-uvr <dig> does not enhance expression of hy <dig> and myb <dig> in transient protoplast assays
as an alternative test of promoter association, we generated synthetic transcriptional activators by creating fusion proteins with the herpes simplex virus vp <dig> acidic activation domain  <cit>  and analysed the effect on target gene expression in a transient protoplast assay. to have a comparative means to guage the effect of uvr <dig> , we used the established dna-binding protein hy <dig>  <cit>  as a positive control  and the non-dna-binding hfr <dig>  <cit>  as a negative control . transient expression of vp16-hy <dig> in arabidopsis protoplasts strongly enhanced expression of its target genes  but not of others  . this is in agreement with previous experiments showing strong activation of chs and myb <dig> in stable transgenic arabidopsis lines expressing vp16-hy <dig> fusion proteins  <cit> . in contrast, vp16-uvr <dig> did not activate the expression of the suggested direct uvr <dig> target genes , either in white light  or in response to uv-b . it is, however, noteworthy that uvr <dig> can act as a uv-b photoreceptor in arabidopsis protoplasts, as was evident by expression induction of marker genes hy <dig> and myb <dig> in response to uv-b in protoplasts derived from wild-type seedlings but not from uvr8- <dig> null mutants . moreover, in uvr8-7-derived protoplasts, transient expression of wild-type uvr <dig> was seen to complement the mutant phenotype . in agreement with protoplast uv-b-responsiveness, enhanced target gene expression associated with vp16-hy <dig> was reduced when protoplasts were treated with uv-b , reflecting the enhanced basal expression levels of the elip <dig>  chs and myb <dig> target genes resulting from a typical transcriptional response to uv-b. conversely, vp16-hfr <dig> expression had no effect on chs, myb <dig>  elip <dig>  hy <dig> or uvr <dig> mrna levels , in agreement with the absence of dna-binding activity of hfr <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> fusion of the vp <dig> activator domain to uvr <dig> does not affect expression of suggested target genes. a, b, c, d, e, f the effect of fusing the vp <dig> activator domain to hy <dig> , uvr <dig>  and hfr <dig>  as measured by expression changes of target and negative control genes. mutant protoplasts prepared from hy5-ks <dig>  uvr8- <dig> and hfr1- <dig> seedlings were transfected with pro

drosophila rcc <dig> chromatin and dna binding residues are not conserved in arabidopsis uvr8
the initial investigation of uvr <dig> chromatin association was inspired by the sequence similarity of uvr <dig> with eukaryotic rcc <dig> proteins  <cit> , prior to publication of the uvr <dig> crystal structure  <cit> . rcc <dig> binds chromatin as part of its biological activity in establishing a rangtp/rangdp gradient, with an increasing ratio in decreasing distance to chromatin  <cit> . the crystal structure of drosophila melanogaster rcc <dig>  in association with a nucleosome core particle  revealed two distinct binding sites, a histone- and a dna-binding loop  <cit> . the dmrcc <dig> histone-binding loop is made up of two key arginine residues  supported by a serine residue  that mediates the interaction with an acidic histone patch  <cit> . on the other hand, the dna-binding activity of dmrcc <dig> is mediated by gln- <dig>  lys- <dig> and arg- <dig> through sequence-unspecific interaction with the dna phosphate backbone  <cit> . although crystal structures of saccharomyces cerevisiae  and human  rcc <dig> proteins have been described and both proteins shown to bind nucleosomes, the molecular details of the chromatin interaction are less well understood . structure comparison showed that critical arginine residues of the histone-binding loop are conserved, arg- <dig> in scsmr1/prp20p and arg- <dig> in hsrcc <dig>  corresponding to dmrcc <dig> arg- <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, hsrcc <dig> arg- <dig> was shown experimentally to be necessary for nucleosome interaction  <cit>  and the mutation of basic residues in the dna-binding loop of hsrcc <dig> showed lys- <dig>  arg- <dig> and arg- <dig> to be important for dna binding  <cit> .fig.  <dig> structural comparison of uvr <dig> with the nucleosome binding interface of rcc <dig> shows that uvr <dig> lacks positive surfaces to interact with nucleosomes. a overview of the drosophila rcc1-nucleosome complex determined by x-ray crystallography  <cit> . both rcc <dig> molecules bind identically to the nucleosome. b dmrcc <dig> viewed through the nucleosome shows the nucleosome interaction interface. left: for rcc <dig>  the solvent accessible surface is shown coloured in terms of electrostatic potential  <cit> . the nucleosome is depicted as semi-transparent. right: the same representation of rcc <dig> with the nucleosome contact surface outlined in pink. dna and histone-binding regions are indicated. c, d, e comparison of electrostatic surface potential of hsrcc <dig>  , scsmr1/prp <dig>   and uvr <dig>   with an orientation identical to that of dmrcc <dig> in . the electrostatic surface potential for the opposite side of uvr <dig> is also shown by rotation of the molecule . pymol  and apbs plugin for pymol  was used for visualization of these structures. f structure-based multiple sequence alignment of rcc <dig> homologs with uvr <dig>  shaded residues indicate those confirmed or proposed to be critical for rcc <dig> binding to the nucleosome



the recent publication of the crystal structure of arabidopsis uvr <dig>  <cit>  allowed us to carry out a structural comparison of arabidopsis uvr <dig> with dmrcc <dig> to check for the presence in uvr <dig> of a conserved nucleosome-binding surface that is critical for histone and dna interaction in dmrcc <dig>  in addition, we compared dmrcc <dig> and scsmr1/prp20p as well as dmrcc <dig> and hsrcc <dig> . as the free structures of hsrcc <dig>  scsmr1/prp20p, and uvr <dig> are likely to undergo structural rearrangements in the switch-back loop and the dna-binding surface upon binding to nucleosomes, it is difficult to compare individual side-chain positions. thus, we chose to compare the electrostatic surface potentials as a measure of histone and dna interaction potential. since both dna and the negative patch on the nucleosome surface are negatively charged, dmrcc <dig> shows strong accumulation of positive charge on both the histone- and dna-interacting surfaces . aligning the structures of hsrcc <dig> and scsmr1/prp <dig> revealed similar positive surface patches . however, uvr <dig> showed a rather negatively charged surface across the entire predicted nucleosome interaction surface, which argues strongly against an rcc1-like binding mode to nucleosomes. in addition, the uvr <dig> surface is generally devoid of strongly positively charged patches  and, thus, does not display the characteristics of a bona fide dna-binding protein. comparing structure-based sequence alignments, it became evident that the overall structural similarity between the uvr <dig> and dmrcc <dig> 7-bladed β-propeller structures is striking but the histone-binding loop in dmrcc <dig> is not conserved in uvr <dig> . similarly, we did not find a potential dna-binding loop in uvr <dig> through structural comparison with dmrcc <dig>  we conclude that the presence of histone- and dna-binding surfaces is a general feature of the chromatin association of eukaryotic rcc <dig> proteins but these are apparently absent in arabidopsis uvr <dig>  this suggests that uvr <dig> may have lost the ability to bind to chromatin, corresponding to the differences in activity between the uvr <dig> and rcc <dig> proteins.

as suggested by the structural analysis, recombinant uvr <dig> did not bind to reconstituted nucleosomes in vitro, either in its ground-state as homodimer or as uv-b-activated monomer . in contrast, recombinant rcc <dig> showed a clear electrophoretic mobility gel shift of the nucleosomes, demonstrating nucleosome binding .fig.  <dig> uvr <dig> does not bind to nucleosomes in vitro. a purified recombinant rcc <dig> and uvr <dig>  were electrophoretically separated on sds-page together or in the absence of reconstituted nucleosomes  and stained by coomassie blue. samples were boiled or non-boiled before loading the gel. b electrop horetic mobility gel shift assay of nucleosome binding by rcc <dig> and uvr <dig>  between  <dig>  - 10 μm rcc <dig> and  <dig>  - 40 μm uvr <dig>  were added to reconstituted mononucleosomes. binding was assayed by emsa and visualized by ethidium bromide staining



CONCLUSIONS
contrary to the current models of uvr <dig> signalling, our data do not support binding of uvr <dig> to chromatin at target genes. moreover, no chromatin-based activity of uvr <dig> could be demonstrated experimentally. however, it has been rather well established that uvr <dig> activity requires uv-b-dependent interaction with cop <dig>  which leads to hy <dig> stabilization . hy <dig> associates with target gene promoters and is required for uv-b-induction of a large portion of the uv-b-induced genes  <cit> . thus, we propose that the effect of uvr8-cop <dig> on gene expression is through hy <dig> and its homolog hyh, without involving direct uvr <dig> chromatin association at the same target genes.

however, we cannot exclude the existence under uv-b of short-lived and/or limited amounts of a possible uvr8-cop1-hy <dig> protein complex that was not detected by our qrt-pcr-based chip assays. arguing against this is the evidence from previous gel-based chip assays which firstly suggested that uvr <dig> associates with the hy <dig> promoter in the absence of uv-b and functional cop <dig> and secondly failed to detect chromatin association of gfp-cop <dig>  <cit> . moreover, no evidence was found for hy <dig> being part of a uvr8-cop <dig> complex  <cit> , nor did we identify direct interaction of uvr <dig> with hy <dig> in yeast two-hybrid assays . however, despite the prime role in uv-b signalling assigned to hy <dig>  hy <dig> lacks a transcriptional activation domain and cannot alone activate transcription  <cit> . thus, to better understand how uvr <dig> regulates gene expression through hy <dig>  we now need to identify hy <dig> partner protein that provide a transcriptional activation domain and enable uv-b-responsive gene expression.
