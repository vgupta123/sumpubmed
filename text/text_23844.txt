BACKGROUND
the principal role of platelets is to control primary haemostasis. physiologically, they patrol the large vascular system, detect endothelium insults and repair vascular damage to prevent leakage  <cit>  to this end, platelets are equipped with molecular detectors that sense molecules abnormally exposed in the vessels, indicating alterations, i.e., danger  <cit> . it has been postulated that tissue repair, beginning with danger exclusion and healing, is important for the initiation of inflammation, especially subsequent to ‘danger’ signalling  <cit> , indicating a possible role for platelets in this process  <cit> . supporting this hypothesis is the discovery that platelets intervene throughout the spectrum of tissue physiology and pathology/inflammation: this has been exemplified in transfusion hazards  <cit>  but also, importantly, in organ inflammatory pathology  <cit> .

for many decades, it has been known that platelets can engulf infectious pathogens, though the nature of binding and endocytosis as well as the outcome of the pathogen within the platelet is still largely unknown. there is now a large body of evidence that platelets are intimately linked with infection. this arises from clinical observations of bacteraemia and sepsis, situations where there is usually a platelet drop and a risk of bleeding, and from experimental animal models. numerous factors have been considered, outlining the complexity of this physiopathology  <cit> .

common to all platelet functions in vivo, including primary haemostasis, physiological inflammation and pathogen sensing, and leading to a wide range of outcomes, from the possible clearance of pathogens to acute pathology, is the discrete secretion of factors. there are three sources of platelet associated molecules: the alpha-granules, the dense granules, and cleavage from membranes. platelet associated membrane molecules are either endogenous, or absorbed from the environment   <cit> . platelets can also secrete and re-internalize some of their products, making their physiology much more complex than initially thought  <cit> . despite being non-nucleated, platelets can secrete enormous amounts of cytokines and biological response modifiers  <cit> , depending on the nature of the stimuli applied to the cells  <cit> . a call for a complete revisit of the interactions between platelets and bacteria resulted from reports that platelets express several types of pathogen recognition receptors, including toll-like receptors , both in human and mouse  <cit> . however, there may be phenotypic and fundamental functional differences between the expression of tlrs in mouse versus human platelets. furthermore, a signalosome was described in platelets, with distinct signalling pathways, through nf-κb activation  <cit> .

in humans, platelets bind different types of gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide  via membrane-expressed tlr <dig>  and can sense them differentially and secrete discrete cytokine profiles  <cit> . in mice, although there is clear evidence of lps-tlr <dig> binding, subsequent platelet activation and cytokine secretion remains largely unclear. the question as to whether lps-tlr <dig> binding can lead to the secretion of soluble cd <dig> ligand , one of the major platelet-secreted factors, has been recently addressed  <cit> ; the possibility that genetic polymorphisms explain the variations in affinity or interactions with physiologically relevant molecules has been raised.

however, another puzzling issue remains regarding lps-tlr <dig> binding and functioning: the interplay with lipopolysaccharide binding protein  and cd <dig>  considered obligate partners of tlr <dig> for ligation of lps. this lps-tlr <dig> signalling pathway has been dissected in the monocyte system, which is extremely responsive to lps in both mouse and human systems  <cit> ; but in contrast to monocytes, platelets do not express cd <dig>  <cit> .

in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that human platelets can “borrow” soluble cd <dig>  from the plasma environment to activate membrane tlr <dig> signalling when exposed to lps. these studies will increase our understanding of how platelets function in pathology in infectious situations, and may lead to medical interventions to prevent either the risk of bleeding or of forming microthrombi, both dangerous conditions in patients.

methods
platelet preparation
in accordance with french regulations , platelets were obtained from regular blood donors who signed a form, after being informed, indicating that they do not preclude the use of their sample for medical research. therefore, by signing the donation form, blood donors give their consent to take part in the study. peripheral blood was collected from healthy donors in endotoxin-free tubes with  <dig> % sodium citrate .platelet-rich plasma  was prepared by centrifugation at 150 × g for 12 min at 22°c. to assess the quality of prp preparation, leukocytes were also recovered at the interphase between the prp and the red cell pellet. red cells contaminating the leukocyte suspension were removed with rbc lysis buffer, according to the manufacturer’s instructions . for some experiments, platelets from prp were washed twice in pbs and resuspended in tyrode’s buffer . the mean leukocyte contamination of the prp preparation was  <dig> % of total cells. analysis of cells showed no expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> but a significant expression of cd <dig>  suggesting that the contaminating cells were mostly t cells and not monocytes.

flow cytometry
cd <dig> expression, characteristic of activated platelets, was measured in prp by flow cytometry after gating on cd41-positive events  in the r <dig> region of the cytogram, as described previously  <cit> . in the same way, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> lineage marker expression was assessed by immunostaining platelets with anti-human monoclonal antibodies . leukocytes obtained after prp preparation and red cell lysis underwent the same staining procedure and were analysed by flow cytometry in the r <dig> region of the cytogram.

phycoerythrin-conjugated mabs against human cd <dig> , allophycocyanin-conjugated mabs anti-human cd <dig>  and fluorescein isothiocyanate -conjugated mabs against human cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig>  or cd <dig>  were purchased from bd biosciences . positive events were recorded by facscalibur  and analysed with cellquest pro .

platelet stimulation
platelets  were stimulated for 30 min at room temperature  with ultrapure s-lps from e. coli 0111: b <dig>  and recombinant cd <dig> . thrombin receptor activator peptide  was used as a positive control. platelets were exposed to lps for 30 min in the presence or absence of mouse anti-human cd <dig> 2; 20 μg/ml; lifespan biosciences, inc., seattle, wa, usa) or the isotype control f <dig> .

scd <dig> depletion in plasma
anti-cd <dig> magnetic beads  were used to capture scd <dig> molecules by negative selection according to the manufacturer’s protocols defined for immunoprecipitation. briefly, 1500 μl of dynabeads were added to 450 μl of prp, incubated 1 hour at rt away from light and removed from prp using a magnetic particle concentrator.

stimulation readout: platelet secretion of scd <dig> ligand
the levels of scd40l were measured in triplicate in aliquots of unstimulated , trap- or tlr <dig> ligand-stimulated platelet supernatants by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay ; details have been provided previously  <cit> . absorbance at 450 nm was measured by elisa reader .

statistical analysis
the wilcoxon paired test was used for comparison of percentages of activated cells and of scd40l secretion in the different experiments. values are expressed as mean ± sd. a p value of < <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
cell studies
the prp composition has been analysed for its purity and representative pictures are shown in figure  <dig>  of particular note, we have focused on the cd14+ and cd41+cd14+ populations . neither prp nor washed cell preparations contain significant cd14+-expressing cells; a 2% contamination or expression appears constant in this series of experiments .figure  <dig>

lps-tlr <dig> activation studies: what role for exogenous cd14?
surface expression of cd <dig>  a characteristic marker of platelet activation, increased 7-fold upon the addition of thrombin receptor activator peptide  ser-phe-leu-leu-arg-asn-pro-asn-asp-lys-tyr-glu-pro-phe – trap 14) , which was used as an activation control , and  <dig> -fold upon exposure to e. coli lps for 30 min . this activation was observed in the presence of autologous plasma rich medium , and was lost after platelet washing . activation was partially restored upon addition of exogenous, recombinant cd <dig> , indicating that cd <dig> is required to achieve activation by lps through tlr <dig> figure  <dig>

consequence of platelet stimulation by lps in the presence or absence of scd <dig> on scd40l secretion
exposure to trap  increased scd40l secretion levels measured in the supernatant  <dig> -fold . stimulation of platelets in their plasma environment with  <dig>   <dig> or 10 μg/ml lps caused an increase in scd40l secretion of  <dig> -,  <dig> - or  <dig> -fold, respectively . however, lps when used at a 1 μg/ml concentration failed to induce scd40l release by platelets.figure  <dig>

to test the hypothesis that plasma-derived cd <dig> is involved in lps-tlr4-induced signalling leading to cytokine secretion, we sought to use an anti-cd <dig> neutralizing antibody to block cd <dig>  anti-cd <dig> antibody  significantly inhibited the augmentation of platelet scd40l secretion upon lps stimulation .

as an additional control and to confirm the role of plasma scd <dig>  we attempted to deplete scd <dig> from plasma before reusing it with autologous platelets for lps-tlr <dig> stimulation. to this end, we used anti-cd <dig> beads . however, despite a significant decrease of scd <dig> in plasma , this was not sufficient to test whether scd14-substantially depleted plasma renders the lps-tlr <dig> unstable for ensuing signalling.

discussion
it has been proposed that, to achieve activation by lps, cd <dig> association with platelet tlr <dig> is necessary  <cit> . this is the accepted model as described in the monocyte, the dominant target of lps sensing. human dendritic cells also signal through this pathway. as platelets are known to display functional tlr <dig> and react to lps-tlr <dig> engagement  <cit>  but do not constitutively express cd <dig>  two plausible explanations can be considered: cd <dig> is indeed used by platelets but comes from an external source, or tlr4/lbp/md <dig> uses another stabilizer for lps sensing through tlr <dig>  the present study shows that scd <dig> is necessary for platelet responses to lps, particularly for the release of scd40l, the dominant platelet-secreted factor. platelets are the main source of scd40l  <cit> . scd40l is a master inflammatory cytokine in many systems, in particular for the production of atheroma plaques and inflammation in cardiovascular disease  <cit> .

md <dig> is a glycoprotein  expressed as both a tlr4-bound complex on cell membranes and as an active soluble form  in the extracellular medium. soluble md <dig> might increase and modulate steady state levels of tlr <dig> on the surface of platelets and thus have a role in innate immunity. indeed, in eukaryotic cells, lps is transferred from cd <dig> to a heterodimeric protein complex involving tlr <dig> and the accessory molecule md <dig>  which forms a complete recognition site for lps. lauer et al.  <cit>  showed that lps responsiveness in epithelial cells can be controlled by circulating smd <dig> that gains access to extravascular spaces with endogenous tlr <dig> on the cell membrane. smd <dig> does not appear to modulate tlr <dig> gene expression directly and tlr <dig> mrna levels did not significantly change in response to incubation with smd <dig>  in accordance with zhang g et al.,  <cit>  we observed the expression of platelet md2/tlr <dig> as  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. even though we observed a significant  increase after trap stimulation , we did not observe significant modulation after e. coli lps incubation , nor cd <dig> on platelet membrane. this discrepancy with the observation of zhang et al. could be explained by the immunostaining technique used. indeed, while we stained platelets directly with a specific anti-cd <dig> fitc-conjugated mab  zhang et al. used indirect immunostaining with a mab against human cd <dig>  and a fitc-conjugated mouse igg.

we thus extended previous findings in showing the requirement of scd <dig> on platelets as well, but in contrast to monocytes, platelets have to obtain it from the circulation. this could be modelled by addition of recombinant scd <dig> to purified platelets exposed to lps; and this could be partly neutralized in the additional presence of neutralizing abs. full activation or suppression of responses was not observed in these experiments, probably because the reagents  used do not exactly mimic the endogenous folding and presentation of components where circulating platelets in the blood flow encounter a lps-harbouring live bacterium. however, the model provides interesting clues to the physiological functioning of platelets in septic inflammation. despite many attempts, it was not possible to completely deplete scd <dig> from plasma to provide further confirmation of its requirement in lps-tlr <dig> signalling. again, we propose that the folding, stability or even purity of the commercial reagent was not optimal to allow any firm conclusion, but the partial demonstration strengthens the proposed model. it cannot, however, be ruled out that another, as-yet undefined, plasma factor is used by platelets to mimic cd <dig> within the tlr4/lbp/tlr <dig> complex.

CONCLUSIONS
dissecting the pathways of platelet physiology , but also of physiopathology   <cit>  is valuable for developing new drugs or treatments, taking advantage of the benefits of platelets while removing their deleterious effects, especially in patients with severe conditions. the contribution of absorbed scd <dig> on platelets to complement lps/tlr <dig> signalling and the subsequent production of proinflammatory products increase our understanding of platelet activation by bacterial products, and may provide a new direction for treatment of patients with bacteraemia/sepsis. controlling lps-induced responses by circulating platelets, as well as leukocytes, could thus reduce systemic lps toxicity and inflammation related to microbial invasion.
