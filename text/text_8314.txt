BACKGROUND
as an important oil crop, soybean provides oils for edible, industrial and new energy uses to meet the increasing demand  <cit> . the oil content in soybean seeds generally ranges from 13% to 22% in various soybean cultivars, and is relatively low compared to most other oilseed crops  <cit> . high content of oil in soybean seeds is hence desirable and has been a major goal of breeding and genetic engineering.

the storage compounds of most seeds consist of carbohydrates, oils, and storage proteins and these compounds contribute up to 90% or more of the dry seed weight. fatty acids are stored as triacylglycerols  in seeds  <cit> . the regulation of tag metabolism involves two mechanisms. one is short term regulation based on substrate availability, allosteric effectors and/or enzyme modification. another way that regulates lipid biosynthesis is through control of enzyme synthesis and turnover rate. these have been achieved by direct modification of fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme to alter relative amounts of particular natural fatty acids, to produce novel fatty acid or to engineer the fatty acid chain length  <cit> . several reports disclose that overexpression or modification of key enzymes, such as acetyl-coa carboxylase  and diglyceride acyltransferase , alters seed oil accumulation  <cit> .

in addition to the regulation at the key enzymes and major steps of lipid metabolism pathway, accumulation of fatty acids and lipids is also regulated at transcriptional level. a few transcription factors have been identified as master regulators of seed oil content by screens of arabidopsis mutants, such as lec <dig>  lec <dig> and wri <dig> <cit> . manipulation of transcription factors can regulate expression of genes in fatty acid biosynthesis and alter the fatty acid/oil levels  <cit> . other seed-specific transcription factors may also have roles in regulation of oil accumulation  <cit> . the storage lipid accumulation may be further regulated by new transcription factors, kinases/phosphatases and/or proteins involved in rna regulation  <cit> . additionally, new strategy has been developed to increase oil content by overproducing wri <dig> for oil biosynthesis but reducing starch biosynthesis at the same time  <cit> .

myb proteins play important roles in multiple aspects of plant growth, development and responses to biotic and abiotic factors  <cit> . myb proteins can be classified into three types: the r2r3-type myb with two repeats, the r1r2r3-type myb with three repeats and the third type usually containing single repeat or atypical repeat in plant. cpc-like  gene family encodes small proteins with single myb motif and negatively regulates trichome development in arabidopsis. seven cpc-like proteins have been identified in arabidopsis, including cpc <cit>  and try <cit> .

previously, we have studied soybean transcription factors and analyzed their roles in abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . three myb genes gmmyb <dig>  gmmyb <dig> and gmmyb <dig> have been found to play differential roles in stress tolerance in transgenic plants  <cit> . we also found that two soybean transcription factor genes gmdof <dig> and gmdof <dig> enhance lipid content in seeds of transgenic arabidopsis plants, through upregulation of lipid biosynthesis-related genes and downregulation of storage protein gene by direct binding to their promoter regions  <cit> . more factors may be involved in regulation of lipid biosynthesis in soybean plants.

in order to identify new genes that possibly regulate accumulation of fatty acids in developing seeds, microarray analysis was performed using rnas from soybean developing seeds at different stages and a series of differentially expressed myb genes were chosen and characterized for their functions  <cit> . among the nine myb genes analyzed, only gmmyb <dig>  a gene encoding a protein with single myb repeat, altered the lipid content in transgenic arabidopsis seeds  <cit> . this gene was investigated in detail due to its potential ability to increase lipid levels. overexpression of gmmyb <dig> increased the oil content in both seeds and leaves of transgenic arabidopsis and transgenic lotus plants, and in transgenic hairy roots of soybean plants. these functions may be achieved through gmmyb <dig> interaction with gl3/egl <dig>  suppression of gl <dig> and activation of pldÎ± <dig> 

RESULTS
gmmyb <dig> gene expression
the developing soybean seeds were divided into seven stages from pollination to mature seeds, and the relative seed weigh at each stage ranged from 4% to 96% when compared to the full size seeds without desiccation . expression of gmmyb <dig>  encoding a protein of  <dig> residues with single myb repeat was analyzed in seeds at these developmental stages by quantitative pcr. the gmmyb <dig> gene was originally identified from microarray analysis using rnas from developing seeds at different stages  <cit> . gmmyb <dig> expression drastically decreased after stage two during seed development and reached the lowest level when seeds were near the full size . the gmmyb <dig> expression was also examined in different organs of soybean, and relatively higher expression levels were observed in flower and root but not in pod , stem or leaf tested .

fatty acid levels were measured in the developing soybean seeds and after stage five, the total fatty acid and composition changed significantly .

phenotypes of the transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing gmmyb73
to study gmmyb <dig> functions, we generated the construct harboring gmmyb <dig> controlled by camv 35s promoter in pprok ii vector and transformed this gene into arabidopsis plants using agrobacterium-mediated floral dip transformation method. gmmyb <dig> expression was examined  in homozygous transgenic lines  and plant phenotypes were investigated.

all the transgenic lines expressing gmmyb <dig> showed almost no trichomes compared to col- <dig> , suggesting that gmmyb <dig> inhibits trichome formation. a phylogenetic analysis was performed to compare the relationship of gmmyb <dig> with other arabidopsis myb proteins involved in trichome formation . gmmyb <dig> was clustered with seven caprice -like proteins with single myb repeat from arabidopsis, including cpc  <cit> , try  <cit> , tcl <dig>  tcl <dig>  etc <dig>  etc <dig> and cpl <dig>  the gmmyb73-overexpressing line oe- <dig> was crossed with try cpc double mutant, which has the distinct clustered trichomes   <cit> . the trichome formation in try cpc mutant harboring the homozygous gmmyb <dig> transgenes  was suppressed in both leaves and stems, similar to that in gmmyb73-overexpressing plants . these results suggest that gmmyb <dig> is a homologue of cpc and try and is involved in trichome formation. gmmyb <dig>  and gmmyb <dig>  are close homologues of gmmyb <dig> in soybean .

gmmyb <dig> binds to gl <dig> and egl <dig> and inhibits gl <dig> expression
in arabidopsis, cpc-like r <dig> myb proteins  are repressors for transcriptional activator and compete with gl <dig>  for binding to gl <dig> and egl <dig>  both are bhlh factors  <cit> . when bound to gl <dig> and egl <dig>  the formation of gl3/egl3/gl1/ttg <dig>  transcription complex was blocked and thereby gl <dig> transcription for a homeodomain transcription factor was inhibited. finally the formation of trichome was repressed  <cit> . gl <dig> mutation results in enhanced oil accumulation in seeds of arabidopsis  <cit> . we also found that both gl <dig> and egl <dig> could interact with gmmyb <dig> in yeast two-hybrid assay . furthermore, these interactions were confirmed in arabidopsis protoplasts using bifc assay, as revealed from yellow fluorescence in nucleus and cytoplasm . these results indicate that gmmyb <dig> can interact with gl <dig> and egl <dig> 

to determine whether gmmyb <dig> affects gl <dig> expression, transgenic arabidopsis plants harboring gl <dig> promoter::gus   <cit>  were crossed with the transgenic plants overexpressing gmmyb <dig>  plants, and gus staining was examined in homozygous gl2p::gus/gmmyb <dig> transgenic plants. in the gl2p::gus plant, gus staining was observed in hypocotyl, root, shoot apex and trichomes of flower buds, leaf and stem . gus staining was strongly inhibited by gmmyb <dig> in hypocotyl and shoot apex in gl2p::gus/gmmyb <dig> plants . trichomes and gus staining were barely detectable in flower buds, leaf and stem of these plants . gus staining was only partially suppressed in roots of gl2p::gus/gmmyb <dig> plants . gus activity was also quantified in leaves, hypocotyls and roots of above transgenic plants, and the levels were consistent with the gus staining results . these results indicate that gmmyb <dig> negatively regulates trichome formation by interacting with gl <dig> and egl <dig> to repress gl <dig> transcription in transgenic arabidopsis plants.

siliques of five developmental stages in gl2p::gus and gl2p::gus/gmmyb <dig> plants were examined and we found that gus staining gradually decreased in developing siliques of gl2p::gus plants . gmmyb <dig> partially suppressed gus staining and gus activity in siliques of gl2p::gus/gmmyb <dig> plants . these results indicate that gmmyb <dig> inhibits gl <dig> promoter activity in developing siliques.

overexpression of gmmyb <dig> promotes seed size and thousand-seed weight
gmmyb <dig> expression changed at different stages of developing soybean seeds  and affected gl <dig> expression in siliques of transgenic plants . we then examined whether seed size was changed in gmmyb73-overexpressing plants. under scanning electron microscope, we found that the try cpc double mutant had smaller seeds compared to col- <dig> whereas the gmmyb73-transgenic plants and gl2- <dig> mutant appeared to have larger seeds . further measurements of seed size revealed that seed length, but not seed width, was significantly increased in gmmyb73-overexpressing plants and gl <dig> mutant compared to col- <dig> . the ratio of seed length to width was not significantly changed in these plants . seed length and ratio of length to width, but not seed width, was significantly reduced in seeds from try cpc double mutant compared to col- <dig> . introduction of the gmmyb <dig> into the double mutant try cpc rescued the seed length and ratio of length to width . these results suggest that gmmyb <dig> and possibly its homologues try and cpc affect seed development and seed size.

thousand-seed weights were also measured and the five gmmyb73-overexpressing lines had significantly higher thousand-seed weights than col- <dig> . the gl <dig> seeds also had slightly but significantly higher levels of the parameter . in contrast, try cpc double mutant had significantly lower thousand-seed weight than col and introduction of gmmyb <dig> recovered the level in try cpc/gmmyb <dig> plants . these results indicate that gmmyb <dig>  its homologues try and cpc, and gl <dig> regulate seed development.

gmmyb <dig> increases lipid contents in seeds and leaves of transgenic arabidopsis and lotus plants, and in transgenic hairy roots of soybean plants
total lipid content in seeds of col- <dig>  gmmyb73-overexpressing lines , and various mutant lines was measured. all five gmmyb73-transgenic lines and gl <dig> mutant had higher levels of total lipids than col- <dig>  and the increase ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . the try cpc mutant had lower lipid content than col- <dig> and the gmmyb <dig> transformation increased the lipid content in try cpc/gmmyb <dig> plants compared to the double mutant . contents of total fatty acids in gmmyb73-transgenic lines and gl <dig> mutant were also increased compared to col- <dig> . the total fatty acids in try cpc mutant were reduced and introduction of gmmyb <dig> in the mutant largely recovered total fatty acid content to the wt level . as to fatty acid compositions, except 18: <dig>  other fatty acids showed slight increase or no significant change in gmmyb73-transgenic lines and gl <dig> mutant compared to col- <dig> . in try cpc mutant seeds, levels of three fatty acids  were significantly reduced compared to col- <dig> and partially rescued by gmmyb <dig> expression .

fatty acid levels were measured in leaves of various plant lines. gmmyb73-overexpressing lines had significantly higher total fatty acid contents in leaf compared to col- <dig> . level of each fatty acid compostion, except 18: <dig>  was also significantly or slightly increased in the transgenic lines compared to the levels in col- <dig> . these results indicate that gmmyb <dig> increased contents of total lipids and total fatty acids in seeds and leaves of transgenic arabidopsis plants.

soybean is a legume plant and we further transformed the gmmyb <dig> into the legume lotus japonicus  plants. two transgenic lines were identified and both displayed gmmyb <dig> expressions compared to wt . total lipids and total fatty acids in seeds of the two lines were significantly increased compared to wt plants . as for the fatty acid composition, only two fatty acids  showed significant increase in the transgenic seeds . fatty acid levels in leaves of the transgenic plants were also determined and we found that total fatty acids and three fatty acids  were apparently enhanced . these results indicate that gmmyb <dig> increases total lipid and total fatty acid contents in seeds and leaves of lotus transgenic plants.

considering that gmmyb <dig> enhanced lipid contents in both seeds and leaves of transgenic arabidopsis and lotus plants, we further examined whether gmmyb <dig> could elevate lipid accumulation in transgenic hairy roots of soybean plants. the gmmyb73-overexpressing vector was transfected into agrobacterium rhizogenes strain k <dig> and the bacterium was used to infect hypocotyls of soybean seedlings through injection. gmmyb <dig> expression was much higher in gmmyb73-transgenic hairy roots  than k599-regenerated roots  . levels of total fatty acids and each of the three fatty acids  exhibited apparent increase in gmmyb73-transgenic hairy roots compared to k <dig> control roots . gmdof <dig>  a gene that enhanced lipid levels in transgenic arabidopsis plants in our previous study  <cit> , can also increase the fatty acid content in the transgenic hairy roots of soybean plants .

gmmyb <dig> enhances expression of pldÎ± <dig> whose promoter can be bound by gl2
gmmyb <dig> inhibited gl <dig> expression . seeds of gmmyb73-overexpressing plants and gl <dig> mutant accumulated more lipids and fatty acids . we examined whether gmmyb <dig> altered downstream gene expressions through suppression of gl <dig>  mutation of gl <dig> results in an increase in seed oil contents  <cit> . gl <dig> represses phospholipase d Î¶ <dig>  gene expression  <cit> . plds affect lipid composition  <cit> . however, increase of seed oil content in gl <dig> mutant is not due to pldz <dig> or pldz <dig> expression  <cit> . we found that pldÎ± <dig> was up-regulated in leaves of gmmyb73-overexpressing plants and gl <dig> mutant, but down-regulated in try cpc plants compared to col- <dig> . these results imply that the gmmyb <dig> may suppress expression of gl <dig>  and thus activate pldÎ± <dig> expression.

we further studied whether pldÎ± <dig> promoter can be bound by gl <dig> in yeast one-hybrid assay. five overlapping dna fragments  in pldÎ± <dig> promoter were tested for gl <dig> binding . only fragment pldÎ±1- <dig> was bound by gl <dig> as revealed from growth of yeast transformants harboring pad-gl <dig> and pabai-pldÎ±1- <dig> in selection medium sd/-leu/+aba . pldÎ±1- <dig> was further divided into eight regions , and these small regions were further tested for gl <dig> binding using a gel shift analysis. gl <dig> bound specifically to two regions of pldÎ±1- <dig>  . increasing concentrations of the non-labeled competitors significantly reduced the band intensity of the dna-protein complexes, indicating that the gl <dig> binding to these elements was specific . a nac protein binding element  was used as a negative control for gl <dig> binding . these results indicate that gl <dig> specifically binds to two elements in pldÎ± <dig> promoter regions.

chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay was used to determine the interaction of gl <dig> with pldÎ± <dig> promoter directly. specific primers were used to amplify pldÎ±1-4- <dig> and pldÎ±1-4- <dig> fragments and the fragments were confirmed by sequencing. gl <dig> bound to the promoter region of pldÎ± <dig> in try cpc double mutant; however, no gl2/pldÎ± <dig> promoter complex was detected in gl <dig> mutant . actin <dig> was used as a negative control. the chip results were negatively correlated with pldÎ± <dig> expression . these results indicate that gl <dig> binds to pldÎ± <dig> promoter and negatively regulates pldÎ± <dig> expression.

pldÎ± <dig> mutation affects lipid accumulation
since pldÎ± <dig> expression was enhanced in gmmyb73-transgenic arabidopsis plants, we examined whether pldÎ± <dig> mutation would affect lipid accumulation. the total lipid content was not significantly changed in seeds of arabidopsis pldÎ± <dig> mutant compared to col- <dig> . the total fatty acid content and linoleic acid level were slightly reduced in seeds of the mutant compared to col- <dig> . in leaves, the contents of total fatty acids and three compositions  were significantly reduced in mutant compared to the col- <dig> .

we further investigated changes of lipid species in various gmmyb73-transgenic arabidopsis plants, pldÎ± <dig> and other mutants. in seeds, compared to col- <dig>  the triacylglycerol  levels were substantially enhanced in gmmyb73-transgenic lines , gl <dig>  and try cpc/gmmyb <dig> plants, but slightly reduced in try cpc and pldÎ± <dig> mutants . the diacylglycerol  levels were significantly increased in gmmyb73-transgenic lines, gl <dig>  and try cpc/gmmyb <dig> plants. the phosphatidylcholine  levels were somewhat reduced in gmmyb73-transgenic lines and gl <dig>  the phosphatidic acid  levels were not significantly changed in all the plants compared . in leaf, the tag, dag and pa levels were mildly increased on average in gmmyb73-transgenic plants whereas the pc levels were slightly reduced in these plants . in pldÎ± <dig> mutant leaf, the tag and pa levels were significantly reduced whereas the pc level was slightly increased compared to that in col- <dig> . these results indicate that gmmyb <dig>  gl <dig> and pldÎ± <dig> most likely act in the same pathway to regulate lipid accumulation.

discussion
gmmyb <dig> gene was identified to have variable expression levels during soybean seed development and to promote lipid accumulation in transgenic arabidopsis. the effect of gmmyb <dig> on lipid accumulation may be achieved through reduction of gl <dig> expression, a negative regulator of oil accumulation, and then release of gl2-inhibited pldÎ± <dig> expression.

overexpression of gmmyb <dig> enhanced seed size and thousand-seed-weight of arabidopsis transgenic plants . the gmmyb <dig> also rescued the seed phenotype and thousand-seed weight in try cpc double mutant . these results indicate that gmmyb <dig> or its homologues in arabidopsis regulates seed development in addition to control of trichome formation. several other genes involved in regulation of trichome formation also affect seed development. these include transparent testa glabra <dig> <cit>  and transparent testa glabra <dig> <cit>  in seed coat differentiation; gl <dig> mutants do not produce releasable mucilage  <cit> ; gl <dig>  egl <dig>  and ttg <dig> regulate seed coat proanthocyanidin biosynthesis  <cit> . some of these genes also play roles in seed size control and thousand-seed weight regulation  <cit> . it should be mentioned that gl2- <dig> seeds  show no change in thousand-seed weight when compared to wt  <cit> . in contrast, the present gl2- <dig>  exhibited slight but significant increase in thousand-seed weight when compared to control . this discrepancy may be derived from different ecotypes used and/or different storage time for seeds. there are other genes that regulate both seed development and aspects of plant growth and development. inhibition of ethylene receptor gene osetr <dig> expression in rice leads to increased thousand-grain weight and early flowering  <cit> . mutation of mhz7/osein <dig> affects grain shape and senescence  <cit> . ethylene and salt-induced nima-related kinase nek <dig> enhances plant growth and seed yield in arabidopsis; however, thousand-seed weight and seed width are reduced  <cit> . recently, two dof genes dof <dig>  and dof <dig>  have been found to promote shoot branching but affect seed/silique development in arabidopsis  <cit> . other genes involved in regulating seed size and/or development are reviewed in  <cit> .

gmmyb <dig> overexpression promotes fatty acid accumulation in transgenic arabidopsis and transgenic lotus plants . the gene also fully rescued the total lipid level and partially rescued the total fatty acid level in try cpc double mutant , indicating that the gmmyb <dig> is involved in upregulation of fatty acid accumulation. it should be noted that the increase of total fatty acid levels in seeds of the gmmyb73-transgenic arabidopsis plants was likely not due to the increase in any specific fatty acid but rather due to the overall increase in each fatty acid level . however, in leaves of the transgenic plants, the increase of the total fatty acids was due to an increase in linolenic acid  . the difference in the accumulation patterns of fatty acids in seed and leaf tissues may be due the physiological and metabolic difference of these organs, where seed is a sink organ, while the leaf is a source organ. in gmmyb73-transgenic lotus plants, the increase of total fatty acids in leaves is mainly due to increase of linolenic acid  , similar to the case in leaves of arabidopsis transgenic plants . however, the seeds of transgenic lotus plants showed a different change in fatty acid compositions compared to seeds of transgenic arabidopsis, and the increase of total fatty acids was attributed to an increase in linolic acid  and/or linolenic acid  . the different accumulation patterns of fatty acid compositions in seeds of transgenic arabidopsis and lotus plants suggest that some different mechanisms may be affected in lipid accumulation in these plant species.

due to the difficulty of soybean plant transformation, we adopted a method for generating transgenic hairy roots in soybean. gmmyb <dig> overexpression in soybean transgenic hairy roots increased the total fatty acid levels and this elevation was likely due to the increase in linolic acid  and linolenic acid  levels . it should be mentioned that the changes in fatty acid composition in soybean transgenic hairy roots were very similar to those in leaves of transgenic arabidopsis plants , suggesting that similar mechanisms may have been affected in vegetative organs of arabidopsis and soybean. it is possible that gmmyb <dig> would promote lipid accumulation in soybean seeds as it did in arabidopsis seeds although further studies are needed to confirm this.

gmmyb <dig> reduced gl <dig> expression , and gl <dig> has been found to be involved in oil accumulation in seeds. shen et al.  <cit>  reported that mutation in gl <dig> gene led to increase in seed oil content compared to wild type levels. overexpression of bnac.gl <dig> b in arabidopsis affected the seed oil accumulation  <cit> . more recently, shi et al.  <cit>  found that the pldz1/ <dig> genes, targets of gl <dig>  <cit> , are not involved in seed oil accumulation. however, blocking mum <dig>  another downstream target of gl <dig>  was found to reduce mucilage biosynthesis, which may be linked to an increase in seed oil production  <cit> . presently, we found that gmmyb73-overexpressing plants and arabidopsis gl2- <dig> mutant had higher levels of pldÎ± <dig>  due to inhibition of gl <dig> expression by gmmyb <dig> . gl <dig> has been shown to bind to pldÎ± <dig> promoter and inhibit pldÎ± <dig> expression . therefore, gmmyb <dig> may promote lipid accumulation by suppressing gl <dig> expression, and thus enhancing pldÎ± <dig> expression.

pld hydrolyses the p-o bond of phosphatidylcholine  to produce phosphatidic acid  and choline. the pa is converted to  <dig> -sn-diacylglycerol   <cit>  by the action of pa phosphatase and then dag can be acylated to produce triacylglycerol . in developing soybean seeds, the major pathway for tag formation is through conversion of pc to dag and acylation of dag to produce tag  <cit> . recently, lee et al.  <cit>  reported that the lipid profile was changed by suppression of pldÎ± in the soybean seeds and the total lipids and tag signals tended to decrease in fresh seeds of pldÎ±-knockdown soybean. presently, we find that pldÎ± <dig> mutation in arabidopsis substantially reduced the tag levels in both seeds and leaves . in contrast, gmmyb73-transgenic arabidopsis plants substantially had more tag in seeds and leaves compared to col- <dig> . it is noted that in seeds, most of the lipid are tag, whereas in leaves, the major lipid species are pc and pa . the roughly negative correlation between pa and pc contents in leaves of both gmmyb73-transgenic plants and pldÎ± <dig> mutant  suggests that gmmyb <dig> may finally promote pa and possible dag and tag accumulation through pc conversion by pldÎ± <dig> function. similar case may happen in gmmyb73-transgenic seeds although pa levels were not high, possibly due to an efficient conversion to dag and tag. all these data suggest that gmmyb <dig> may enhance lipid accumulation at least partially through repression of gl <dig> and promotion of pldÎ± <dig>  other downstream genes  may also be involved in this process  <cit> . it should be mentioned that the gmmyb73-overexpresing arabidopsis plants have no or very little trichomes. considering that trichome contained a multitude of wax components and can secrete lipids  <cit> , the lack of trichome may save total energy and resources for lipid biosynthesis in other organs such as seeds and leaves of transgenic plants. recently, pldÎ± <dig> overexpression has been found to improve drought tolerance and increase seed yield  <cit> , lending support to our present study.

it is interesting to note that, although gmmyb <dig> enhances lipid contents in transgenic seeds, its expression during soybean seed development is not consistent with the fatty acid accumulation pattern at these stages . the discrepancy may be due to gmmyb <dig> being an upstream regulator and hence being expressed early in seed development in order to regulate downstream genes including gl <dig>  pld and possible other genes. at later stage, the gmmyb <dig> is reduced and the downstream factors and lipid biosynthesis genes are activated for lipid accumulation. another gene gmbzip <dig>  with an increase in expression during soybean seed development, increases lipid contents in seeds of transgenic arabidopsis plants through promotion of sugar translocation by activation of sucrose transporter genes and cell-wall invertase genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we find that gmmyb <dig> promotes lipid accumulation in transgenic plants, possibly through suppression of gl <dig> and release of gl2-inhibited pldÎ± <dig> expression. seed size and thousand-seed weights are also elevated by gmmyb <dig> expression in transgenic arabidopsis plants. manipulation of gmmyb <dig> or the homologues may improve oil production in legume crop plants.
