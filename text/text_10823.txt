BACKGROUND
thymus-derived regulatory t cells , or natural tregs , suppress the proliferation of bystander t cells through ctla- <dig>  il- <dig> or secreted or membrane-bound forms of tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . granzyme b-mediated suppressive mechanisms have also been identified and result in the selective killing of antigen presenting b cells  <cit>  and bystander effector t cells  <cit> . in the tumor microenvironment, granzyme b is important for treg-mediated suppression of tumor clearance  <cit> . recent evidence also demonstrates a role for treg-specific granzyme b expression in the initiation and maintenance of allograft tolerance  <cit> . thus, granzyme b mediated induction of apoptosis in target cells represents an additional suppressive mechanism utilized by tregs. many of the aforementioned studies of granzyme b were performed in murine models utilizing pre-activated tregs. preactivation with sustained t-cell antigen receptor  and cd <dig> co-receptor stimulation in the presence of interleukin- <dig>  appears to enhance suppressive abilities over those of freshly isolated ntregs  <cit> . tcr/cd28/il- <dig> stimulation also results in marked expansion of tregs and is useful for the generation of sufficient numbers for adoptive transfer. expansion may also influence the expression of granzyme b, but a detailed study of granzyme b expression patterns in fresh and expanded human ex vivo ntregs has not been performed.

il- <dig> is essential for the development, maintenance and function of the regulatory t cell pool. high-level expression of the il-2r alpha chain  is characteristic of tregs although it is not specific for them as it is also expressed on activated effector t cells. mice deficient in specific components of the il-2-il-2r signaling pathway suffer from severe autoimmune disease  <cit>  and a lymphoproliferative syndrome  <cit>  and lack functional tregs  <cit> . triggering of the il-2r results in the phosphorylation of stat <dig> which binds the promoter region of the foxp <dig> gene suggesting that it has a regulatory function  <cit> . further, t cell specific deletion of stat <dig> results in reduced numbers of tregs in mice  <cit> . these studies demonstrate the importance of il- <dig> and the central dependence on il-2r mediated stat <dig> activation for promotion of foxp <dig> expression and acquisition of a suppressive phenotype.

a previous study has shown that il- <dig> alone is sufficient to induce granzyme b and lytic activity in cd8-positive t cells without tcr stimulation  <cit> . natural killer  cells also upregulate granzyme b in response to il- <dig> alone  <cit>  and transcription of granzyme b in primary nk cells, an nk cell line  and a t cell line  requires il- <dig> mediated nf-κb activation  <cit> . although phosphoinositide-3-kinase  can mediate nf-κb activation in diverse cell types, neither the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> nor mitogen activated protein kinase  pathway inhibitors suppress il- <dig> stimulated granzyme b expression in nk <dig> nk cells  <cit> . since tregs exhibit some distinct differences in pi3k pathway signaling, including an altered pattern of akt activation  <cit>  and altered il-2r signaling  <cit> , there may be differences in the reliance on pathways upstream of nf-κb for the induction of granzyme b.

recent clinical reports suggest that rapamycin, but not cyclosporine, preserves the peripheral cd4+, cd25+, foxp3+ regulatory t cell pool in transplant patients  <cit> . in vitro, rapamycin preferentially suppresses the proliferation of mouse cd4+cd25- t cells but not cd4+cd25bright ntregs under conditions of tcr/cd <dig> activation in the presence of il- <dig>  <cit> . this is likely due to an inherent lack of dependence, by tregs, on the mammalian target of rapamycin  pathway for proliferation or maintenance of foxp <dig> expression levels  <cit> . since stat <dig> activation is critical for treg maintenance, the presence of rapamycin could theoretically enhance il-2r mediated activation of the janus tyrosine kinase /stat <dig> pathway thereby favoring tregs. therefore, rapamycin may have both in vivo and in vitro utility for increasing the relative abundance of tregs in a physiologically heterogeneous t cell population. an in vitro study using human alloreactive conventional cd4+ and cd8+ t cells showed decreased granzyme b expression and decreased cytotoxic activity in rapamycin treated cells  <cit> . however, the effects of rapamycin on granzyme b expression in human tregs have not previously been evaluated.

in this study we sought to clarify the signaling pathways in tregs that are important for granzyme b expression including the necessity for tcr and cd <dig> activation. furthermore, we sought to evaluate the effects of pi3k pathway inhibitors on granzyme b expression, including the clinically important mtor inhibitor rapamycin. we found that engagement of both the tcr and cd <dig> was necessary for granzyme b expression. inhibitors of the pi3k-mtor pathway including both rapamycin and ly <dig> markedly suppressed granzyme b expression but did not prevent proliferation or interfere with foxp <dig> expression levels. in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay using a hodgkin lymphoma cell  that we have previously observed to be susceptible to treg-mediated killing , tregs expanded in the presence of rapamycin had a significant decrease in cytotoxicity as compared to tregs expanded without rapamycin. the finding that rapamycin suppresses granzyme b expression may indicate that rapamycin-expanded tregs utilize suppressive pathways other than granzyme b to mediate their effects on bystander lymphocytes under physiologic conditions.

methods
flow cytometry
the following antibodies were used for the flow cytometric evaluation of t cell subsets in this study: anti-cd <dig> , anti-cd <dig> , anti-cd <dig> , anti-foxp <dig> , all from biolegend inc. . anti-granzyme b  was from ebioscience . for the carboxy-fluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester -based proliferation studies only, anti-foxp <dig>  was purchased from bd biosciences . cells were permeabilized using a commercially available fixation and permeabilization kit  per the manufacturer's instructions. propidium iodide  and annexin v-pe were from pharmingen . cfse  was used at a final concentration of  <dig> μm. cells were labeled for  <dig> minutes in phosphate buffered saline  containing cfse at 37°c then placed in pre-warmed media for  <dig> minutes, washed two times and plated as indicated in the figures. flow cytometry was performed on a facscanto ii flow cytometer  using facsdiva software  except for cell sorting which was performed on a facsvantage flow cytometer . final data analysis was performed using flojo software . the statistical significance of differences in granzyme b expression and foxp <dig> expression between subsets was assessed using the student's t-test.

regulatory t cell isolation/enrichment
institutional review board  approval was obtained from the university of utah health sciences center to obtain peripheral blood from normal adult volunteers. all blood donors provided informed consent prior to blood collection. blood was collected by peripheral venipuncture in ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid -coated vacutainer tubes . peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from normal donors by density gradient centrifugation using ficol-paque density medium  according to the manufacturers recommendations. subsequently, cd4+, cd25+ tregs were enriched using a magnetic bead-based kit  according to the manufacturers instructions. this technique routinely resulted in samples that were enriched in regulatory t cells to a purity of approximately 60-70% or more based on foxp <dig> staining by flow cytometry. however, higher purity tregs were required for the cytotoxicity assays. for the 6-hour cytotoxicity assays, peripheral blood ntregs were isolated based on flow cytometric sorting of the cd4+, cd25bright  t cell fraction. for the 48-hour cytotoxicity assays, isolation based on the cd4+, cd25+, cd127-dim/negative expression pattern characteristic of tregs was performed using a magnetic bead based kit . both methods resulted in a similar pre-expansion purity of >90% tregs, based on flow cytometic evaluation of foxp <dig> expression.

cell culture, stimulation, expansion and cytotoxicity
human peripheral blood t cells were maintained in rpmi  <dig> medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum  at 37°c in 5% co <dig> for the indicated time. where indicated, cells were expanded with anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> coated beads  or anti-cd <dig> coated beads , both at a bead:cell ratio of 4: <dig>  where indicated, recombinant human il- <dig>  at  <dig> iu/ml  was also added. in some experiments, inhibitors were added to the culture  <dig> minutes prior to the addition of the above stimulants. these included rapamycin  at  <dig> ng/ml or  <dig> ng/ml, or the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig>  at  <dig> μm or <dig> μm, all in dimethyl sulfoxide . in some cases, freshly enriched cd4+, cd25+ t cell samples were frozen in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen in freezing medium  then thawed and analyzed by flow cytometry at the same time as their cultured  counterparts. these samples are designated as "unstimulated" in the figures. freezing in this way did not have an effect on antigen expression patterns or viability. the human hodgkin lymphoma cell line, l <dig> was obtained from the german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures  and maintained in rpmi medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. for the cytoxocity assays, purified peripheral blood ntregs were expanded as indicated then co-cultured at a 3: <dig> effector:target ratio with l <dig> target cells, pre-labeled with cfse in media without added stimuli. controls consisted of l <dig> target cells alone or l <dig> target cells co-cultured with non-activated conventional cd4+ t cells . an additional positive control for the 6-hour samples consisted of l <dig> cells alone cultured with  <dig> μm staurosporine  to induce apoptosis. samples were then stained with annexin-v-pe to assess early apoptosis in the 6-hour assays or for propidium iodide to assess late apoptosis in the 48-hour assays. annexin-v binding or pi staining were then assessed in the cfse labeled target cell population to quantify apoptosis. significance was assessed with the student's t test.

RESULTS
granzyme b is not expressed by freshly isolated peripheral blood cd4+, cd25+ tregs or cd4+, cd25- conventional t cells from normal adults
tregs and tconv were isolated from the peripheral blood of normal adults. freshly isolated cells were evaluated for expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  foxp <dig> and granzyme b by flow cytometry. foxp <dig> expression was only seen in the cd25+ subset. granzyme b expression was not detected in peripheral blood cd4+ t cells in any of the freshly isolated samples from the four normal volunteers tested. representative dot plots showing expression of the above markers are shown in figure  <dig> for the fraction depleted of tregs  and the fraction enriched in tregs .

expansion of ex vivo enriched human tregs with cd3/cd <dig> stimulation and il- <dig> induces expression of granzyme b but il- <dig> alone or cd <dig> stimulation alone does not
tregs were enriched from peripheral blood then subjected to stimulation for  <dig> days in vitro using il- <dig> alone , cd <dig> stimulation alone with anti-cd <dig> coated beads or combined cd3/cd <dig> stimulation with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> coated beads with il- <dig> . on day  <dig>  samples were simultaneously stained for cd <dig>  foxp <dig> and granzyme b  and evaluated by flow cytometry . granzyme b was assessed in the distinct foxp <dig> bright population representing tregs  and granzyme b staining was expressed as mean fluorescence intensity  . neither il- <dig> alone or anti-cd <dig> alone promoted an increase in granzyme b expression. however, anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> coated beads plus il- <dig> induced a marked increase in the level of granzyme b staining. staining of a duplicate cd3/cd <dig> and il- <dig> stimulated sample with anti-cd <dig>  anti-foxp <dig> and a granzyme b isotype control antibody confirms the specificity of anti-granzyme b antibody staining .

inhibition of mtor by rapamycin and inhibition of pi3k by ly <dig> suppresses granzyme b expression in tcr/cd28/il- <dig> stimulated tregs
enriched peripheral blood ntregs were subjected to in vitro expansion for  <dig> days using cd3/cd <dig> beads and il- <dig>  in the presence of the indicated inhibitor. in the case of rapamycin, similar conditions have previously been shown to lead to selective expansion of cd4+, cd25bright, foxp3+ tregs with retained suppressive capabilities  <cit> . using flow cytometric evaluation of cd <dig>  foxp <dig> and granzyme b and gating on foxp3-bright cells , we found that pi3k inhibition resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of granzyme b expression that was complete at  <dig> μm ly <dig> . rapamycin treatment at only  <dig> ng/ml also resulted in marked suppression of granzyme b expression . to confirm that these findings were not simply due to the induction of cell death by the inhibitors, the cultures were evaluated for pi staining by flow cytometry . there was no increase in the number of pi positive cells in any of the inhibitor treated samples as compared to samples without inhibitor treatment. flow cytometric evaluation of foxp3-bright cells demonstrated an activation induced increase in the level of foxp <dig> expression , versus that seen in freshly isolated peripheral blood tregs in all stimulated samples, regardless of inhibitor. evaluation of triplicate samples showed no significant suppression  of activation-induced enhancement of foxp <dig> expression in the rapamycin or low dose ly <dig> treated samples . the sample treated with high dose ly <dig>  showed a slight but significant decrease in activation induced foxp <dig> enhancement . given this finding, we conclude that there is no correlation between granzyme b expression and foxp <dig> expression.

cd4+, foxp3+, cd <dig> negative tregs expand preferentially in the setting of rapamycin treatment when compared with cd4+, foxp3-, cd127+ tconv
the proliferation of tregs and tconv in response to the strong stimuli of cd3/cd <dig> beads and il- <dig> was assessed in the presence of mtor or pi3k inhibitors. enriched peripheral blood tregs , pre-labeled with cfse, were cultured with rapamycin  or ly <dig>  plus cd3/cd <dig> beads and il- <dig>  for  <dig> days. to quantify the initial number of tregs and tconv in the culture, cd <dig>  foxp <dig> and cd <dig> levels were assessed by flow cytometry prior to expansion . after expansion, single cell evaluation of cfse staining and foxp <dig> expression was performed by flow cytometry in order to separately quantify proliferation in the foxp3+ and foxp3- subsets. this revealed preferential expansion of tregs in the presence of rapamycin at  <dig> ng/ml and  <dig> ng/ml but similar proliferation in the sample expanded without inhibitors and in the sample expanded in the presence of ly <dig> . to more rigorously compare the proliferative response of the foxp3+ and foxp3- fractions in the context of mtor inhibition by rapamycin the percentage of cells in each generation was quantified . in the setting of  <dig> ng/ml rapamycin, which corresponds to therapeutic human plasma levels  <cit> , six total treg generations and five tconv generations could be defined by cfse staining with  <dig> % of tregs in generations  <dig> and  <dig> versus  <dig> % of tconv. in the samples subjected to the highest rapamyin concentration  similar results were obtained although there was suppression of proliferation in both treg and tconv fractions . these findings show that under identical conditions, proliferation of tregs is highly favored by rapamycin treatment.

expansion of cd4+, foxp3+, cd127- tregs results in upregulation of the il-7r to levels equivalent to those seen in foxp3- tconv
the il- <dig> receptor  has been shown to be expressed at lower levels in foxp3+ tregs and to inversely correlate with their suppressive capacity  <cit> . in agreement, we found that prior to expansion, cd <dig> levels were indeed lower in foxp3+ tregs . we wondered whether expansion with cd3/cd <dig> stimulation and il- <dig> resulted in a retained pattern of low cd <dig> expression in tregs. interestingly, we found essentially identical cd <dig> levels in expanded tregs and tconv  suggesting a limited utility for cd127-based purification techniques for separating in vitro expanded tregs from tconv.

tregs expanded in vitro without rapamycin have increased in vitro cytotoxicity versus tregs expanded in rapamycin
multiple previous studies have demonstrated that tregs expanded in rapamycin maintain their suppressive function  <cit> . however, such assays require co-culture of tregs with target cells, usually cd4+ or cd8+ conventional t cells, in the presence of tcr/cd <dig> stimulation either via antibodies or irradiated antigen presenting cells, the very conditions that we have shown to induce granzyme b expression. in order to avoid inducing de novo granzyme b expression during suppression assays in tregs previously expanded in rapamycin, and to separate the suppressive and cytotoxic function of tregs, we developed a flow cytometry based cytotoxicity assay using a hodgkin lymphoma cell line  that we had previously observed to be susceptible to in vitro treg-mediated cytotoxicity . we used this observation to test the cytotoxic function of tregs expanded in vitro with and without rapamycin. peripheral blood ntregs were isolated by flow cytometry based on cd4+/cd25bright characteristics  or by a bead-based method designed to isolate based on a cd4+, cd25+, cd127- surface antigen expression profile . both methods gave similar pre-expansion ntreg purities of >90%, based on foxp <dig> expression. ntregs were then expanded with cd3/cd <dig> beads plus il- <dig>  with and without rapamycin  as indicated. post-expansion treg purities are shown in figure 6a/c. samples were subsequently co-cultured at a 3: <dig> ratio of foxp3+ tregs  to cfse-labeled l <dig> target cells for  <dig> or  <dig> hours as indicated. apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric analysis of the cfse labeled target cell fraction. early apoptosis was measured by annexin-v binding to target cells in the  <dig> hour cytotoxicity assays. for the 48-hour assays, late apoptosis was measured by pi staining of the target cell population. representative dot plots from a 6-hour cytotoxicity assay are shown in figures 6a/b. statistical analysis of multiple 6-hour replicates showed a significant increase in annexin-v-positive apoptotic target cells co-cultured with ntregs expanded without rapamycin . the increase in apoptotic target cells co-cultured with ntregs expanded in rapamycin was not statistically significant . staurosporine treated cells served as a positive apoptosis control. for the 48-hour cytotoxicity assays, representative data, including statistical significance, are shown in figure 6c/d. although cytotoxicity was present for both treg subsets , it was significantly higher for tregs expanded without rapamycin. thus, in this system cytotoxicity at both  <dig> and  <dig> hours correlates with granzyme b expression, and inversely with rapamycin exposure, in expanded ntregs.

discussion
adoptive transfer of in vitro expanded, ex vivo peripheral blood ntregs has been suggested as a potential treatment for patients suffering from autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammatory diseases, graft-versus-host disease  or to suppress organ rejection in transplant patients  <cit> . indeed, early animal studies in the setting of solid organ transplantation have been promising  <cit> . however, the optimum conditions for generating or expanding suppressive regulatory t cells remains somewhat controversial. for the generation of suppressive, induced tregs  from cd4+, cd25- naïve tconv, tgf-β <dig> is required  <cit>  as is il- <dig>  <cit> . for polyclonal expansion of peripheral blood ntregs, sustained t-cell receptor activation and cd <dig> co-receptor triggering using plate- or bead-bound anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> along with high dose il- <dig> is necessary  <cit> . interestingly, expansion of polyclonal ntregs with anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> stimulation and il- <dig> elevates their suppressive capabilities above those of freshly isolated ntregs in an in vivo murine model <cit> . thus, in vitro expansion may impart properties that are absent in freshly isolated ntregs. however, the mechanisms that account for this are unclear.

tregs have an altered pattern of pi3k-mediated tcr and il-2r signaling and, related to this, they have a unique ability to expand in the presence of rapamycin. however, other potentially unique aspects of tcr- or il-2-mediated treg signaling have not been thoroughly explored. our goal was to evaluate granzyme b expression patterns in in vitro expanded ex vivo human peripheral blood ntregs and determine the signals that induce granzyme b. furthermore, we studied the necessity for pi3k-mtor signaling for granzyme b expression and the effects of rapamycin. we found that granzyme b was not expressed in any peripheral blood cd4+ t cell subset in the normal donors tested. utilizing enriched samples of peripheral blood ex vivo ntregs typically containing approximately 70% tregs and 30% tconv by foxp <dig> expression, we found that t cell receptor triggering alone was insufficient to induce granzyme b expression, consistent with previous reports that tregs are anergic in vitro to tcr stimulation alone  <cit> . similarly, high dose il- <dig>  treatment alone failed to induce granzyme b expression. this observation is in contrast to previously reported findings in nk cells and cd8+ t cells where il- <dig> without additional stimuli results in elevated expression of granzyme b  <cit> . we found that sustained activation of both the tcr and cd <dig> along with high dose il- <dig>  conditions optimal for treg expansion  <cit> , led to a rapid and marked induction of granzyme b. however, pretreatment of cd3/cd28/il- <dig> expanded tregs with rapamycin or the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> resulted in a marked suppression of granzyme b. thus, signaling through the pi3k-mtor pathway appears necessary to support granzyme b expression. the observation that il- <dig> treatment alone fails to induce granzyme b expression may be related to the fact that tregs, in contrast to effector t cells, do not activate downstream targets of pi3k in response to il-2r stimulation  <cit>  apparently due to inhibition by pten  <cit> . thus, in addition to the lack of proliferation in response to il- <dig> previously shown by others  <cit> , the lack of granzyme b induction by il- <dig> outlined here is an additional physiologic ramification of the altered il-2r signaling in tregs that has not previously been reported.

we, like other groups  <cit> , found that rapamycin-treated tregs subjected to strong cd3/cd <dig> stimulation in the presence of il- <dig> retain their ability to proliferate. single cell flow cytometric analysis of proliferation of tregs and tconv under identical expansion conditions revealed a striking difference in proliferative capacity in the setting of rapamycin treatment that appears to markedly favor tregs. this effect was most evident at a concentration of  <dig> ng/ml, a dose that corresponds to therapeutic human plasma levels  <cit> . higher rapamycin doses yielded suppression of both treg and tconv, although to a greater degree in the latter. we have also shown that the activation induced enhancement in foxp <dig> protein levels in stimulated cells is similar, regardless of the presence of rapamycin or low dose pi3k inhibition. we therefore conclude that granzyme b is not simply a so-called "activation marker" but that it is subject to a distinct means of regulation that depends on a tcr/cd <dig> induced pi3k-mtor mediated signaling mechanism that is distinct from those mechanisms that regulate proliferation and foxp <dig> expression. of note, many of the previous studies of the role of granzyme b in regulatory t cells have been performed in murine model systems  <cit>  and studies of granzyme b in human tregs are relatively few. previous studies by grossman, et al. utilizing human cells described expression of granzyme b in adaptive  regulatory t cells generated in vitro by anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> treatment in the presence of il- <dig> that resulted in cytotoxic activity against human target cell lines  <cit> . this same group found much lower levels of granzyme b expression in cd3/cd28/il- <dig> expanded natural tregs  <cit> . the reason for this difference is unclear but may be related to differences in expansion conditions and strength of stimuli between this, and the current study.

we have also shown that longer term  activation results in upregulation of surface il-7r  levels in ntregs but not in tconv. this has the effect of equalizing post-activation cd <dig> expression in both t cell types. this finding indicates that using low-level cd <dig> expression to identify or sort ntregs may be problematic in the setting of cd3/cd28/il- <dig> activated or expanded tregs.

induction of foxp <dig> expression in tregs differentiated in vitro from naïve cd4+, foxp3- t cells treated with tgfβ is blocked by transfection with constitutively active forms of akt  <cit> . however, ntregs exhibit little suppression of pre-existing foxp <dig> protein levels when treated in a similar fashion  <cit> . taken together, the previous data and that presented here indicate that pi3k-akt-mtor signaling is dispensible for ntreg proliferation, it appears to suppress de novo induction of foxp <dig> expression in naïve t cells, it has little impact on pre-existing foxp <dig> protein levels or in the activation induced increase in foxp <dig> seen in activated ntregs, and it promotes a granzyme b-mediated cytotoxic function in activated ntregs. thus, mtor signaling may yet have a role in treg physiology.

CONCLUSIONS
in human cells, we confirm the finding that rapamycin treatment favors the outgrowth of ntregs in response to strong stimuli due to differential inhibition of cd4+, cd25- conventional t cells under identical expansion conditions. furthermore, our data shows that pi3k-mtor signaling is important for cd3/cd <dig> induced granzyme b expression in human ntregs. tregs expanded in rapamycin exhibit suppressed granzyme b expression and a correspondingly lower cytotoxic activity in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay using a cell line as target cells. the effects of rapamycin on granzyme b expression may suggest that other suppressive strategies are dominant in rapamycin treated tregs under physiologic conditions.
