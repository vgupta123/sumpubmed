BACKGROUND
induced pluripotent stem cells  are somatic cells that have been epigenetically reprogrammed to a pluripotent state using the ectopic expression of defined factors  or small molecule treatments  <cit> . like embryonic stem cells , ipscs have the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers and thus, represent a viable option for autologous cell replacement therapies. a number of groups have investigated the potential of ipscs for generating in vitro models of neurodegenerative maladies, such as, parkinson's disease, retinal degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and rett syndrome  <cit> . although these studies are encouraging, little is currently known about the molecular underpinnings of reprogramming and the faithfulness with which ipscs can recapitulate neuronal differentiation.

although ipscs of both mouse and human origins appear morphologically indistinguishable from escs, several reports have emerged showing variations at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels  <cit> . in contrast, studies by guenther et al.  <cit>  and neumann and cooper  <cit> , have shown convincingly that the discrepancies between ipscs and escs are not significantly different from variations between esc lines with divergent genetic backgrounds  <cit> . moreover, laboratory-specific factors such as culture conditions and reprogramming methods may be an underlying cause of these observed differences  <cit> . variations in teratoma forming ability, hematopoiesis and neuronal differentiation have been observed among mouse and human ipsc lines  <cit> . recently, polo et al.  <cit> , kim et al.  <cit>  and marchetto et al.  <cit> , observed that many early-passage mouse ipsc lines maintain a persistent epigenetic signature of the tissue type of origin. interestingly, when directed to differentiate to hematopoietic or osteogenic cell types, these early-passage cells were biased toward their original cell state, thus leading to low differentiation efficiency  <cit> . at later passages, the ipscs differentiated more efficiently, which led the researchers to conclude that a period of prolonged cellular proliferation may be a necessary component of the reprogramming process. in light of these findings, it has become clear that newly derived ipsc lines should be thoroughly characterized based on their expression of endogenous pluripotency genes, morphology and differentiation capacity. however, information is lacking whether extensive passaging has effects on the competence of ipscs to give rise efficiently to a neuronal lineage.

the goal of this study was to assess the effects of passaging on genetic stability in ipscs and their efficiency in giving rise to functional neurons. we also wished to compare the neural differentiation potential of ipscs with that of escs, by performing quantitative evaluation of temporal expression patterns of a battery of genes expressed sequentially during neural development. due to the reported similarities between ipsc and escs, we hypothesized that both cells undergo similar transitions in the expression of key markers of neural differentiation. we found that ipsc lines we generated had variable competence to generate neural cells. we speculated that these discrepancies could stem from the inherent heterogeneity of ipsc cultures prior to differentiation or a residual epigenetic signature from the tissue of origin  <cit> . we found that, after continual passaging, an ipsc line with a low efficiency of neural conversion could recapitulate the gene expression patterns seen in escs undergoing neural differentiation. these findings highlight the importance of extensive cellular turnover for establishing a fully reprogrammed state in ipscs prior to directed neural differentiation.

RESULTS
newly derived mouse ipscs show variable neural inductive ability at early-passages
we used  <dig> newly established mouse ipsc lines  and an established esc line derived from the inner cell mass of an r <dig> mouse embryo   <cit> . three of the ipsc lines were generated via retroviral transduction of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with mouse oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and nanog , whereas the gg <dig> clones were transduced with human oct <dig>  sox <dig> and klf <dig>  notably, the reprogramming factor c-myc was omitted to minimize the number of transgenes. the mips-20/ <dig> lines were generated using fibroblasts from transgenic mice carrying a green florescent protein  gene driven by the oct <dig> promoter; therefore, pluripotency and differentiation could be monitored by the expression of gfp   <cit> . ipscs and escs were maintained and subjected to a 2-step neural induction protocol  as previously described  <cit> . all cell lines maintained a stereotypical esc morphology  in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor  and fetal bovine serum . after adaptation to feeder-free conditions ipsc cultures displayed spontaneous differentiation at the edges of most cell clusters . by contrast, spontaneous differentiation in esc cultures was undetectable.

pluripotent cells located in the center of these clusters were revealed by alkaline phosphatase staining , which was consistent with gfp expression in mips-20/ <dig> . upon dissociation and placement in serum-free cellular suspension, all cell lines formed embryoid bodies , although the abundance of ebs varied greatly in ipsc cultures . when plated and treated with neural induction medium, both esc and ipscs displayed characteristic neuronal epithelial morphology within  <dig> days . neurite-like processes extended from the cell clusters as early as  <dig> days after the start of neural induction . by day  <dig>  neuron-like cells with characteristic bipolar, multipolar and pyramidal morphologies were observed in both esc and ipsc cultures . the prevalence of ebs with at least some non-neuronal morphologies was greater than 90% in all early-passage ipsc cultures . specifically, rhythmically beating cells with morphology resembling cardiomyocytes were observed in approximately 10% of plated ipsc ebs and multi-lineage cells were ubiquitous .

originally, we had concerns that transgene re-expression may be a confounding factor during the differentiation process due to previous reports of this phenomenon in ipscs derived using retroviruses  <cit> . however, analysis of endogenous transcripts for the reprogramming factors, oct <dig>  sox <dig> and klf <dig>  discounted transgene expression in the gg <dig>  line . the overall quality of this cell line was further ensured by expression analyses of genes in the dlk1-dio <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> . recent reports concluded that repression of this locus, specifically the genes gtl <dig> and rian, is a defining feature of poor quality mouse ipscs that lack the ability to generate "all-ipsc mice" via tetraploid complementation  <cit> . we analyzed the expression level of gtl <dig> and rian in the gg <dig>  line and found no difference in their expression levels when compared to escs . moreover, no significant difference in expression levels of gtl <dig> and rian was observed between early- and late-passage ipscs . considering the final differentiation performance of the gg <dig>  line , this method of ipsc quality assessment should prove useful in future experiments where new ipscs are derived.

to better characterize cellular phenotype, we performed immunocytochemistry on gg <dig>  cells at neural induction day  <dig>  thirty to forty percent  of cells stained positive for the early neural marker huc/d, as well as, the mature neural markers synaptophysin , ÃŸiii-tubulin , microtubule associated protein  <dig>  and neural nuclei protein . as shown in previous studies, a subset of cells expressed brain-specific homeobox/pou domain protein 3a , indicating the presence of sensory-like neurons . the majority of these cells were also positive for neurofilament and calretinin, consistent with our previous analysis of esc-derived neurons   <cit> . furthermore, we found that map <dig>  tuj <dig>  neun and neurofilament expression persisted beyond day  <dig> in ipsc cultures . the presence of syn+ puncta and growth cones was indicative of maturing neurons . this staining profile is consistent with the forebrain-like neurons observed in our and others' previous esc analysis   <cit> . from this point on, the gg <dig>  and mips- <dig> lines were chosen for further analysis based on their disparate methods of generation and ability to form spherical ebs with similar abundance  as escs.

extended passaging enhances pluripotent gene expression in an undifferentiated state and increases the rate/efficiency of neuronal conversion
although ipscs exhibit neural phenotypes similar to escs at early-passages, we postulated that the observed morphological and differentiation inconsistencies were a result of either incomplete reprogramming or the heterogeneity of our ipsc cultures. recent literature suggests that a prolonged period of proliferation and self-renewal may be necessary to stabilize ipscs in a pluripotent state  <cit> . accordingly, we passaged ipscs at least  <dig> times prior to repetition of neural induction  <cit> . at 20- <dig> passages, spontaneous differentiation was undetectable in both gg <dig>  and mips- <dig> cell lines, whereas gfp expression was uniform in the mips- <dig> line . interestingly, we observed a significant increase in the diameter of ebs  derived from late-passage gg <dig>  cells, which was equivalent to the eb size seen in esc cultures . furthermore, relative to early-passage ipscs, most cells in late-passage gg <dig>  cultures expressed sox <dig>  with few observable differentiated sox2- cells . real-time qrt-pcr revealed that expression levels of the pluripotency markers oct <dig>  sox <dig>  rex <dig> and nanog in late-passage cultures were significantly higher than those in early-passage ipscs and were equivalent to expression levels in escs . notably, nanog expression in late-passage cells remained significantly lower than in escs, but there was an upward trend .

to assess the transcriptional changes occurring in ipscs over the course of neural differentiation, we carried out additional qrt-pcr using cdna generated from undifferentiated cells, cells at eb day  <dig>  and neural induction days  <dig> , and  <dig> . to clearly delineate events of gene up- and down-regulation, we evaluated the expression of immature- and mature-neuronal markers. expression of pluripotency markers  in ipscs declined promptly during the eb stage and subsequent differentiation . the immature-neural markers, neurogenin <dig> , musashi <dig> , sox <dig> and huc/d are all transiently expressed during in vivo neural development and have been detected in our cultures previously  <cit> . as expected, the mrna levels of these genes in esc cultures elevated during early differentiation , but declined as neural induction proceeded  . by contrast, the induction of immature-neural marker genes was delayed in early-passage ipscs . however, after 20- <dig> passages, temporal expression patterns and levels of immature-neural markers were not significantly different from escs . we next evaluated the expression of mature neural markers, neuron specific enolase , syn , calretinin and trkb . we found consistently that expression of these genes is induced by ni <dig>  but increases dramatically by ni <dig> in esc cultures . this pattern of expression was seen in early-passage ipscs, but was not as robust. as with the other markers, late-passage ipsc-derived cultures exhibited significantly higher levels of nse and syn expression than early-passage ipscs at ni <dig> .

to better quantify the efficiency of neural differentiation, we performed flow cytometry analysis for the neural lineage marker cd <dig>  <cit> . our data revealed a lower percentage of cd24+ cells in early-passage ipsc-derived cultures  compared to esc-derived cultures , which was in accordance with our immunocytochemistry observations . this percentage increased to approximately 50% in early-passage ipsc neural induction day  <dig> cultures . consistent with the pcr analysis, the late-passage ipscs at neural induction day  <dig> contained a comparable percentage of cd24+ cells when compared to escs . together, these results showed that extended passaging enhances ipsc homogeneity and similarity to escs in our culture system.

ipsc derived neurons exhibit an improved functional profile after extended passaging
to evaluate the functional status of ipsc-derived neurons, we performed whole cell patch clamp experiments between days 7- <dig> of neural induction . for consistent analysis, we chose cells with a distinct bipolar or multipolar morphology . the average resting membrane potentials were similar between early and late-passage ipscs at ~ <dig> mv, which was more depolarized than those recorded in escs . using a current step protocol, ~90% of patched esc-derived neurons elicited repeated action potentials and robust inward and outward currents . by contrast, early-passage ipsc-derived neurons, although morphologically similar to esc-derived cells, produced only solitary or paired action potentials with comparatively weak inward and outward currents . action potentials were recorded from only ~23% of cells. hyperpolarizing the cells  typically did not substantially enhance the ability of early-passage ipsc-derived neurons to generate repetitive action potentials. moreover, these cells displayed poor membrane integrity, as indicated by low input resistances that tended to get even lower fairly rapidly, which made recording difficult. late-passage ipsc-derived neurons were capable of producing action potentials of similar amplitude and frequency as esc-derived neurons. robust action potentials were recorded from ~58% of cells . accordingly, the inward and outward currents  were equivalent with those detected in esc neurons .

discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically compare the neural differentiation capacity between early- and late-passage murine ipscs. of our four ipsc lines, three  generated neuronal populations greater than 30%  of the total cell populations in early-passage culture when we applied an esc-based neuronal induction protocol. our group and others have previously shown that this protocol yields neuronal population of greater than 80% purity using murine escs  <cit> . quantitative gene expression analysis revealed a similar, but temporally delayed pattern of neural lineage gene expression between escs and one ipsc line . we found that serial passaging improved the stability and maintenance of two newly derived ipsc lines in an undifferentiated state . moreover, upon neural induction, late-passage ipscs and escs undergo nearly identical temporal changes in gene expression . these results strongly suggest that sufficient cellular divisions are necessary to generated stable ipscs clones that can achieve directed differentiation efficiencies comparable to escs.

the increase in expression of pluripotency factors in late-passage gg <dig>  cells  seems to agree with previous reports showing that differential gene expression between escs and ipscs diminishes after passaging  <cit> . since the rnas for our analyses were extracted from whole cell populations, we must be careful in drawing conclusions about the individual cells within ipsc populations. the qrt-pcr data in figure 4b is more an indication of the homogeneity of undifferentiated cultures, than a direct measure of pluripotency. for instance, the mrna from early-passage cultures may be diluted by the mrna of spontaneously differentiated cells, which would lower the measured relative expression of genes uniquely expressed in undifferentiated cells. thusly, these data suggest that late-passage gg <dig>  cultures contain a pluripotent population of cells roughly as homogeneous as our esc cultures. alternatively, we can conclude that the pluripotent state of these ipsc lines is more stable at later passages. likewise, our analyses of neural markers in figure  <dig> demonstrates the comparatively equivalent percentage of cells expressing these genes in late-passage gg <dig>  and esc cultures at each time point. these similarities in gene expression are particularly noteworthy when one considers that gg <dig>  ipscs and escs were derived from mice with disparate genetic backgrounds .

our results also point to functional differences between early-passage and late-passage ipsc-derived neurons. however, it is important to note that the results in figure  <dig> are not entirely comprehensive in their assessment of each neural induction culture. for instance, we did not label a specific subtype of neurons for analysis ; thus, the neurons analyzed may have represented multiple phenotypes despite having a similar morphology. in future studies, the use of subtype-specific fluorescent reporters may allow for more precise assessment of a particular population of stem cell-derived neurons. regardless of these technical limitation, the generation of repeated action potentials with corresponding na+/k+ currents was used as a general criterion for excitatory functional neurons. in early-passage cultures, we were unable to record repeated action potentials even after  <dig> days of differentiation. this indicates that neurons developing in early-passage cultures may be functionally defective. we speculate that the extreme heterogeneity of early-passage neural cultures may create an environment that is not conducive to functional maturation.

a growing body of work has demonstrated that ipscs can give rise to a wide array of neural subtypes using protocols optimized for escs  <cit> . however, few studies consider thoroughly the relative efficiency with which differentiation occurs between escs and ipscs. recently, hu et al. published work showing that human ipsc lines derived using disparate methods  displayed variable efficiencies when directed to differentiate into motor neurons  <cit> . remarkably, cell lines derived using non-integrating episomal expression of the transgenes appeared to be just as susceptible to variation in differentiation potency as cells derived using retroviruses, which suggests that variability is independent of derivation method. these findings are reminiscent of our initial comparison of early-passage ipscs and escs in that differentiation potency failed to match that seen in escs. it is noteworthy that the passage numbers of the ipsc cell lines used by hu et al. were not reported, so it is possible that these observed differences could be attenuated with sufficient cellular turnover. more recently, boulting et al. found that early- and late-passage human ipscs performed similarly during motor neuron differentiation and functional analysis, despite karyotypic abnormalities in some late-passage cell lines  <cit> .

since varying differentiation propensities among ipsc lines appear to be independent of derivation methods, the beneficial effect of repeated passaging may reveal an underlying feature of cellular reprogramming in general. it has been proposed that a residual signature or "memory" of the cell type of origin persists throughout the reprogramming process in the form of hypo- or hypermethylated regions of the genome and/or aberrant gene expression  <cit> . it is possible that hypermethylation of neural gene promoter regions may have confounded early-passage ipsc differentiation, although we did not directly test this. several new studies also report the generation of genetic mutations, deletions and copy number variations during the reprogramming process  <cit> . over successive cellular divisions, however, it appears that epigenetic marks are progressively "erased" or, perhaps, selected against. at the moment, the precise mechanisms of this process are unclear, but the epigenetic signature appears to be a phenomenon in both mouse and human reprogrammed cells  <cit> . of note, hussein and colleagues recently demonstrated that early-passage human ipsc lines have a high prevalence of genetic copy number variations. surprisingly, the amount of copy number variations declined rapidly over successive passages  seemingly due to selective pressure on the aberrant cells  <cit> . it is feasible that this phenomenon is reflected in our current observations. for future investigations it will be necessary to examine karyotypic stability and copy number variation over the course of these experiments to determine if neural differentiation is impacted by these factors.

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented herein demonstrates that extended passaging can lead to more stable ipscs, which in turn leads to more efficient neural differentiation. the utility of this approach will certainly be elucidated by further studies examining the effect of passaging on chromosomal stability in ipscs. importantly, the present results highlight the need for improved screening methodologies to isolate ipsc clones with the greatest potential for directed differentiation. future studies identifying methylation signatures that define fully reprogrammed ipscs will be helpful in developing better assays to evaluate the progression of reprogramming. interestingly, some reports suggest that neuronal conversion of recalcitrant ipscs can be greatly improved through treatment with chromatin-modifying drugs or small molecules  <cit> . undoubtedly, for the eventual application of ipscs in disease modeling or cell replacement therapies, complete reprogramming will be critical for unbiased analysis of disease progression and safety.
