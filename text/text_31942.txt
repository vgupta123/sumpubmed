BACKGROUND
laccases are multi-copper-binding phenoloxidases  that were first detected in the japanese lac tree toxicodendron verniciflua; they are also found in certain other plants as well as many insects and a variety of fungi  <cit> . laccases are particularly widespread in ligninolytic basidiomycetes, and more than  <dig> different basidiomeceteous laccase genes have been described  <cit> . the biological functions of laccase in fungi are diverse, as laccase is implicated in various cellular processes, including delignification  <cit> , sporulation  <cit> , pigment production  <cit> , fruiting body formation  <cit> , and pathogenesis  <cit> .

using oxygen as the final electron acceptor, laccases catalyze the oxidation of a number of aromatic substances such as diphenols, methoxy-substituted monophenols, and aromatic amines  <cit> . many laccases are characterized by the presence of one type- <dig>  one type- <dig>  and two type- <dig> copper ions. one electron at a time is removed from the substrate by a type- <dig> copper ion and is transferred to the type-2/type- <dig> copper site, where molecular oxygen is reduced to water  <cit> . because of their low substrate specificity, industrial applications for laccases include delignification  <cit> , the purification of colored waste water  <cit> , textile dye decoloration  <cit> , beverage and food treatment  <cit> , the sulfurization and solublization of coal to their use in enzyme-based biosensors  <cit> , and the transformation and inactivation of toxic environmental pollutants  <cit> . in addition, recent studies have shown that the substrate specificity of the enzyme can be broadened in the presence of redox mediators  <cit> . given the versatility and broad spectrum of substrate specificity, laccases could become among the most important biocatalysts in fungal biotechnology  <cit> .

at least three different laccases are present in chestnut blight fungus c. parasitica  <cit> . among these, laccase <dig> is of interest because it is induced specifically by the presence of tannic acid but not by other commonly known fungal laccase inducers such as ferulic acid and  <dig> -xylidine, which are structurally related to lignin  <cit> . in addition, given that c. parasitica is a necrotic fungus rather than a wood-decaying fungus, laccase <dig> is unique to c. parasitica and is predicted to be involved in overcoming tannic acids, an abundant group of phenolic compounds found in the bark of chestnut tree that function as a natural barriers against pathogen infection. the phenolic metabolism in plants is complex and yields a wide array of compounds ranging from flower pigments to the complex phenolics of the plant cell wall lignin. however, the group of phenolics known as tannic acids is clearly distinguished from other plant phenolics in terms of chemical reactivity and biological activity  <cit> . tannic acids are water-soluble phenolic compounds with molecular weights between  <dig> and  <dig>  that exhibit distinct properties such as the ability to precipitate alkaloids, gelatin, and other proteins  <cit> . the characteristic that sets tannic acids apart from all other phenolics is their ability to precipitate proteins. therefore, having an enzyme capable of degrading tannic acid or that is insensitive to the presence of tannic acid may be useful for various applications of plant tissue materials. thus, producing laccase <dig> on an industrial scale may be useful for processing plant materials with high contents of tannic acid.

because laccases are notoriously difficult to express in nonfungal systems  <cit> , several fungi, including saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , trichoderma reesei  <cit> , aspergillus oryzae  <cit> , pichia pastoris  <cit> , kluyveromyces lactis  <cit> , a. sojae  <cit> , and a. niger  <cit> , were used for the heterologous expression of laccase. although p. pastoris has been used as a heterologous host for laccase more often than s. cerevisiae in yeast because of its higher production levels, successful expression in s. cerevisiae has been reported  <cit> . in addition, s. cerevisiae has a long history of application as a gras  organism without the integration of expression constructs. therefore, we report here the heterologous expression of a novel laccase <dig> using s. cerevisiae and its effects on the transformed s. cerevisiae.

RESULTS
analysis of transformed s. cerevisiae
from  <dig> to  <dig> transformants of s. cerevisiae representing each recombinant plasmid were selected on ura- medium. colony pcr using the dna preparations from these putative transformations revealed the presence of amplified  <dig> -kb dna fragment, indicating that the recombinant plasmid was transferred into yeast. in addition, transformation of e. coli using dna preparations from all selected transformants confirmed the presence of the recombinant plasmid in yeast.

expression of lac <dig> protein using constitutive promoter
expression of the transgene encoding laccase <dig> directed by the gpd promoter was examined by enzymatic assay using culture supernatant and dmop as enzyme and substrate, respectively. when culture supernatants of transformants grown in yepd media for  <dig> days were measured for enzymatic activity, no laccase activity was observed. however, when culture supernatants were prepared from the ura- selective broth, all transformants showed laccase activity. there were variations in laccase activity among the strains transformed with the same expression construct. a wide variation in heterologous gene expression in s. cerevisiae is not unusual when episomal  <dig> μ ori-based plasmids are used, possibly because of variation in the plasmid copy number between different transformants  <cit> . thus, transformant tyeglac3- <dig> showing the highest enzyme activity was selected for further analysis. transformant tyeglac3- <dig> was cultured for  <dig> days in the ura- selective media, and samples were analyzed to obtain the temporal expression pattern of recombinant laccase <dig> . the highest laccase activity was  <dig>  mu/ml culture supernatant detected after  <dig> days of cultivation. thereafter, a rapid decrease in enzyme activity was detected as the culture progressed . native gel electrophoresis of culture supernatant followed by staining with dmop substrate solution revealed the presence of a band showing the laccase activity . coomassie blue-staining of the native gel revealed the presence of a protein band at the corresponding position . in addition, western blot analysis showed the immuno-reactivity of the corresponding protein band . again, neither laccase activity nor an immuno-specific band was observed in the culture supernatant of transformant tyeglac3- <dig> grown in nonselective media and nutrient-rich yepd media. these results indicate that ura- selection is required for the transformant to show laccase activity, which is maintained in ura- selective cultured media. moreover, they also indicate that laccase activity in the culture supernatant is due to the protein product of the lac <dig> gene .

because the laccase <dig> from c. parasitica is responsive to tannic acid, oxidation of tannic acid by the expressed laccase <dig> was measured using a tannic acid-supplemented medium. plates containing  <dig> % tannic acid-supplemented ura- selective medium were prepared, and transformed cells were grown. as shown in figure  <dig>  transformants showed dark brown coloring around the colonies, whereas no color reactions were observed around the vector-only transformed cells . this indicates that transformants are able to express and secrete laccase <dig> into medium and that the expressed recombinant laccase <dig> maintains biochemical characteristics of oxidizing a phenolic compound such as tannic acid.

plasmid stability and cell growth of recombinant strains
plasmid stability and cell growth were assessed by measuring cfus on nonselective yepd as well as selective ura- media and by counting the number of cells using haemacytometer, respectively. the transformant tyeglac3- <dig> and two other randomly selected transformants, tyeglac3- <dig> and - <dig> were examined for plasmid stability. when the plasmid stability of transformants grown in yepd broth was measured by plating  <dig> ul  <dig> diluted 3-day-old culture suspension on a ura- selective plate and a nonselective yepd plate, more than 65% of cells appeared to lose plasmid after the 3-day incubation . this number was significantly higher than that of mock transformants and of previous studies using similar plasmids  <cit> . although it was not as high as for yepd media, this high plasmid instability was also observed in the cells grown in ura- selective medium, in which 50% of plated cells were not able to grow to form distinct colonies.

 <dig> colony-forming units per plate

 <dig> for each strain,  <dig> ×  <dig> cells were inoculated into corresponding media, as described in materials and methods.

 <dig> five replicates of each strain were used, and each experiment was repeated three times. values are shown as the means ± standard deviation.

cell growth was also compared between lac <dig> transformants and a mock transformant. compared to the mock transformant, which exhibited  <dig> cfus on a yepd plate, lac <dig> transformants exhibited less than 40% growth. in addition, when cells were grown in ura- selective broth, further reduction in cell growth  was observed compared to that of a mock transformant .

effect of cultured broth on expressed lac3
even though the number of cells harboring the plasmid was significantly reduced during cultivation of the tyeglac3- <dig> transformant in nonselective yepd media, a large number of cells still contained the plasmid. it was interesting that no laccase activity was detected in the cultured supernatant of yepd. we therefore examined enzyme stability by measuring enzyme activity followed by mixing the supernatant of ura- selective broth containing laccase activity with the supernatant of cultured yepd broth. after  <dig> h of incubation at 25°c, no laccase activity was observed. however, mixtures with fresh yepd media or reaction buffer showed laccase activity, indicating that expressed laccase activity is sensitive to cultured yepd media, whereas laccase activity in the ura- selective media is stably maintained.

the instability of expressed laccase activity in the cultured yepd media was examined using various protease inhibitors. as shown in figure  <dig>  laccase activity in the supernatant of ura- selective broth was abolished when the medium was mixed with supernatant of cultured yepd broth. however, when the cultured yepd medium was preincubated with pepstatin, an aspartyl protease inhibitor, and then mixed with the supernatant of ura- selective broth containing laccase activity, residual laccase activity was observed, although it was not as distinct as that of the control. no protection was observed aprotinin, edta, e- <dig> protease inhibitor, leupeptin, or pmsf.

expression of lac <dig> protein using an inducible gal <dig> promoter
expression of the transgene encoding laccase <dig> directed by an inducible gal <dig> promoter was examined. when transformants harboring the plasmid pyegallac <dig> were cultured for  <dig> days in 2% galactose-containing inducing media, culture supernatants of all transformants showed the enzyme activity . a primary inoculum was prepared from  <dig> ml appropriate media to maintain selection but with 2% raffinose/ <dig> % glucose as the carbon source. there were variations in laccase activity among the strains transformed with the gal <dig> promoter expression construct as well. the transformant tyegallac3- <dig>  which showed the highest enzyme activity at  <dig>  mu/ml culture supernatant, was selected for further study. compared to the transformant tyeglac3- <dig> expressing the lac <dig> gene by the constitutive gpd promoter, transformants using an inducible gal <dig> promoter revealed higher levels of laccase activity. in addition, no growth defects of the transformant tyegallac3- <dig> in yepd media were observed , suggesting that no growth defect was observed unless laccase expression occurred. the plasmid stability of the introduction of pyegallac <dig> to the selected transformant tyegallac3- <dig> was good, as more than 85% of the cells retained the plasmid after the 3-day incubation in nonselective media. these results suggested that the stability of the plasmid was maintained unless laccase expression was induced.

 <dig> colony-forming units per plate

 <dig> for each strain,  <dig> ×  <dig> cells were inoculated into corresponding media, as described in materials and methods. yepd and galactose-supplemented glucose free ura- selective media  were used as non-induction and induction media, respectively.

 <dig> five replicates of each strain were used, and each experiment was repeated three times. values are shown as the means ± standard deviation.

discussion
laccase catalyzes one-electron oxidation of diverse substrates with the concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water by the transfer of four electrons. laccases are divided into "low-redox potential" and "high-redox potential" laccases depending on the structure and properties of the copper centers  <cit> . we recently characterized a new laccase, laccase <dig>  which is induced by the presence of tannic acid  <cit> . sequence comparison indicates that laccase <dig> belongs to the "low-redox potential" group, which is more common in fungi with the exception of white-rot fungi  <cit> . given that this enzyme is specific to tannic acid and represents a new laccase from necrotic but not wood-decaying fungus, characterizing its biochemical properties is of interest. however, like most other laccases produced by fungi, its expression level is far too low, and the presence of tannic acid appears to be a limiting factor for protein purification because it precipitates the protein. therefore, the heterologous expression of functional laccase <dig> is required for a better understanding and application of this enzyme.

compared to previous studies that used s. cerevisiae as a laccase expression host, the present study showed a relatively high maximum enzyme activity of  <dig>  u/l  <cit> . however, improved laccase production using s. cerevisiae was achieved by direct evolution and expression of the mature form of laccase, which replaced the endogenous prepropeptide with that of the s. cerevisiae α-factor and removed the inhibitory c-terminal extension  <cit> . laccase <dig> from c. parasitica, like some other laccases from ascomycetes, does not have a c-terminal extension and exhibits c-terminal ends with the last four amino acids of asp-ser-gly-ile, which represent the processing site  <cit> . thus, replacing the endogenous laccase signal peptide with the rice amylase1a signal peptide represents the engineered portion of the recombinant laccase <dig> gene construct in this study, which may be further manipulated to produce economical levels of expression. in addition to conventional laccase activity on a commonly known substrate such as dmop, yeast-expressed laccase <dig> showed the characteristic enzyme activity on tannic acid, which was visualized by coloring the tannic acid-supplemented media on which the recombinant strains expressing laccase <dig> were grown. therefore, these results potentiate the possible application of the recombinant yeast strain for treating phenolic waste even in the presence of tannic acid. in addition, the plate assay based on the color reaction showed a clear contrast; i.e., recipient cells showed no browning around the colonies, but dark browning around the colonies was observed in transformants. as in the case of the bavendamm assay, used to measure the phenol oxidase activity, the area of the colored zone appears to correlate with enzyme activity  <cit> . therefore, this test can be further applied as a simple screening method for selecting transformants with higher laccase activity.

selection pressure to maintain the recombinant vector designed to express the laccase constitutively resulted in a growth defect as detected by the reduced number of cells. however, harboring the vector only without the laccase gene or maintaining the recombinant vector designed to induce the laccase expression under non-inducing conditions did not result in any growth defects. in addition, no significant growth defect was observed by expressing other foreign protein products using a similar constitutive promoter  <cit> . moreover, growth defects of transformants using an inducible promoter for laccase expression were observed only when transformants were cultured under induction conditions. therefore, expression of recombinant laccase <dig> appears to be harmful to the host cell. this is in accordance with most previous studies, in that an inducible instead of a constitutive promoter was used for the successful expression of laccase in yeast. like other ligninolytic enzymes, laccases are notoriously bad at producing large amounts as recombinant proteins  <cit> . one of the possible limitations to the mass production of recombinant laccase is the harmful effect on cell growth observed in this study. therefore, controlled expression of laccase via the application of an inducible promoter is suggested for the large-scale production of recombinant laccase. further studies examining the effect of laccase expression on the growth of s. cerevisiae will be of interest.

the expressed protein product of laccase <dig> was labile to the cultured media of nutrient-rich yepd. the instability of expressed laccase activity could be due in part to the protease activity in cultured media, because pepstatin  was able to preserve some residual laccase activity. the lack of protection using other protease inhibitors such as aprotinin , edta , e- <dig> , leupeptin , and pmsf  suggests that the residual protease activity is due to the presence of an aspartyl protease, which is expressed under some conditions of fermentation  <cit> . it is of interest to see that the host strain s. cerevisiae  <dig> is a mutant at the pep <dig> gene encoding protease a . strain lacking protease a accumulate inactive precursors of protease b and carboxypeptidase y and show reduced activity of a number of other hydrolases, which consequently results in a significant reduction of overall proteolysis  <cit> . therefore, another aspartyl protease may contribute in part to the instability of the laccase. however, there may to be additional reasons for the instability of laccase beyond the protection of residual laccase activity by pepstatin. whether because of protease activity or other unknown reasons, the instability of laccase seems to be specific rather than general, because the same host strain is used for the expression of various proteins, including enzymes, cytokines, and structural proteins  <cit> , without noticeable instability of expressed target proteins. therefore, along with the controlled expression of laccase in the recombinant strain, culture conditions that minimize the degradation of expressed laccase, such as using defined simple media rather than complex media, could be applied to improve the production of recombinant laccase <dig> and to further apply recombinant strains to treat phenolic compounds.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, this study demonstrated the heterolgous expression of a novel tannic acid-inducible laccase <dig> and described why laccase expression on commercial scale is difficult. in addition, we have suggested a possible method of producing a large amount of recombinant laccase and discussed the potential of the recombinant strain for bioremediation.
