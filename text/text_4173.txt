BACKGROUND
mating with relatives occurs commonly in small populations and can result in a decline in offspring performance  known as inbreeding depression  <cit> . inbreeding depression typically has important consequences for variation in lifetime fitness and juvenile development both within and among populations  <cit> . due to an increase in homozygosity, inbreeding can reduce performance by either decreasing the frequency of heterozygotes  or unmasking deleterious recessive alleles . regardless of the mechanism by which inbreeding depression arises, it is usually more readily detected in traits that are linked with fitness . this is because strong directional selection promotes fixation of advantageous genes, which means that traits linked with fitness have a higher proportion of dominance relative to additive genetic variance . many studies show that inbreeding affects individual traits . even so, our understanding of what factors cause variation in the extent to which inbreeding has deleterious effects, and why some traits are affected but not others, remains limited.

the extent of inbreeding depression may be affected by the environment an individual experiences  <cit> . stressful environments  are generally expected to exacerbate the effects of inbreeding  <cit> . however, over a broad range of taxa and conditions, studies looking at the interaction between inbreeding and stressful conditions have yielded inconsistent results . different species, populations, inbred lines, sexes, and families are highly variable in their response to inbreeding and different types of stress . an extensive review by armbruster et al.  <cit>  found that inbreeding depression increased by 69 % on average in stressful environments, but increased significantly in fewer than half the studies. more recently, a meta-analysis has suggested that the effect of the environment on inbreeding scales linearly with the magnitude of the stress imposed  <cit> . thus it appears that the level and type of stress experienced play some part in explaining variation in the severity of inbreeding depression.

a further explanation for the inconsistent effects that stressful environments have on inbreeding depression is that it depends on the developmental or life history stage at which stress is experienced . however, most studies look at how stressful environments experienced during adulthood or throughout an organism’s life influence the effects of inbreeding  <cit> . relatively few studies investigate how stressful environments experienced during particular life stages and, more specifically, during early-life affect the subsequent performance of inbred and outbred individuals  <cit> . only six studies in a major review by fox and reed  <cit>  explored the interaction between inbreeding and an environmental stress that was restricted to early in life.

a restricted diet during development has the potential to reduce adult body size and consequently lower fecundity, increase predation, and reduce mating success, among other costs . given the potential fitness costs of small adult body size, animals often respond to periods of diet restriction during their juvenile growth phase by increasing growth rates once their diet returns to normal  or by delaying maturity until they reach a normal size . however, these responses often incur costs such as increased predation risk, changes in locomotor performance, and a reduced lifespan . the lack of studies that explore the relationship between inbreeding and a dietary stress early in life is unexpected given the burgeoning interest in ‘compensatory growth’ to make up for a ‘poor start’ in life  with putative long term costs of elevated ‘catch-up’ growth  <cit> . to date, there are surprisingly few experimental studies documenting levels of inbreeding depression that use restricted food availability early in life as an environmental stress and measure its effects on growth and any carry-over effects on size at maturity or other adult traits . it is reasonable to assume that the ability to respond to a restricted diet during early development will depend on genotype , including the decline in heterozygosity that arises with inbreeding.

here, we manipulate the amount of food given to experimentally create inbred  and outbred  juvenile eastern mosquitofish . fish in the control treatment received the standard laboratory diet, while those on a low food treatment received less than 25 % of this amount of food for a 21-day period during early development  before returning to the control diet. we used data from over  <dig> snps to confirm that inbreeding reduced genome-wide heterozygosity. we then quantified the interaction between inbreeding and experiencing a presumably more stressful rearing environment. specifically, we aim to test whether diet restriction during early development differentially influences subsequent growth trajectories and adult phenotype depending on whether an individual is inbred or outbred.

previous work has shown that female, but not male, g. holbrooki show compensatory growth when assigned to our low food treatment, and that both sexes exhibit catch-up growth, albeit with a proportionately longer delay in maturation time for males than females  <cit> . in addition, we have shown that males reared on the low food treatment are less attractive to females  <cit> . this suggests that they are less fit so, by definition , the low food treatment is ‘stressful’.

to date there have been almost no studies experimentally manipulating inbreeding in g. holbrooki . more generally, however, there is good evidence that inbreeding lowers a range of performance measures in another poeciliid fish, the guppy . we did, however, use a subset of the current data  <cit>  to show that there is no effect of inbreeding on size at birth and growth over the first seven days in g. holbrooki. there is, however, a decline in brood size suggestive of inbreeding elevating embryo mortality. more importantly, we have recently shown that the inbred sons of full-siblings gain a lower share of paternity when they compete with outbred males . finally, kruuk et al.  <cit>  recently reported consistent variation among families in their growth rate on control and low food diets. given inbreeding generally lowers performance it seems worthwhile to test whether the more ‘extreme’ genotypes created by inbreeding extend the genetic variation beyond that naturally occurring which might then explain some of the variation in growth patterns.

given these previous studies we predict that:inbred fish will generally have slower growth rates, take longer to mature, and be smaller at adulthood than outbred fish .

inbreeding depression will be greater when fish are placed on a restricted diet as juveniles .

inbred fish will show weaker compensatory and/or catch-up growth than outbred individuals .



RESULTS
inbreeding and heterozygosity
we confirmed that there is sufficient genetic variation in our study population for a full-sibling mating to have a readily detectable effect on offspring heterozygosity. based on data from over  <dig> snp loci, we found that a brother-sister mating led to a significant decline in offspring heterozygosity  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). the mean heterozygosity of inbred fish was  <dig>  % less than that of outbred fish . the proportion of loci that were heterozygous was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in inbred males  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in outbred males . hereafter we therefore use inbred versus outbred status in our analysis.

is there an effect of inbreeding on mosquitofish?
contrary to our predictions, we did not find any evidence of inbreeding depression. this was the case in both the control environment, and in the stressful low food environment that led to almost zero growth over the three-week period in which food was restricted . we have previously reported the effects of inbreeding on birth size and growth to 7 days using a subset of the current data  <cit> . with the current larger dataset we still found no difference in size at birth, or size at one week of age  between inbred and outbred fish . we also found no significant effect of inbreeding on growth rates, adult size, age at maturity, survival until adulthood, or the sex ratio at maturity .table  <dig> results from mixed models with chi squares  values for significance tests of estimated parameters for inbreeding and food treatment

is inbreeding depression exacerbated under a stressful environment?
contrary to our predictions, we did not find any evidence of an interaction between inbreeding and the diet treatment for any of the nine traits measured . there is therefore no evidence that inbreeding depression for these traits is elevated after individuals are exposed to the more stressful low food environment.

does diet affect growth rate in mosquitofish?
note, when testing for an effect of diet on growth rate we always included inbreeding status in the model. prior to imposing the diets, we found a sex difference in growth from birth to one week of age due to females growing significantly faster . given that control diet fish were fed ad libitum with a. nauplii twice a day throughout the experiment and low food diet had their food restricted from  <dig> to 28 days of age when they were fed 3 mg of a. nauplii once every other day, we found a significant difference between fish on the control and low food diet in the mean growth rate from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  as expected, the low food diet almost totally suppressed growth, resulting in far smaller fish by day  <dig>  females still grew significantly faster than males when fish were on the control diet, but not when on the low food diet, presumably because there was so little growth by either sex .

when fish on the low food diet were returned to the same diet as that of control fish, they showed a significant increase in growth from day  <dig> to  <dig> compared to control fish. this was, however, due to their smaller size at the beginning of this period. we did not find any evidence of initial compensatory growth when comparing growth from a comparable starting size . although fish on each diet had a similar starting size , those on the low food diet actually showed significantly slower growth immediately after returning to a normal diet. in general, after day  <dig> , females grew significantly faster than males regardless of diet treatment. we did not find any evidence for overall compensatory growth; growth to sexual maturity was not affected by diet nor did it differ between the sexes.fig.  <dig> mean growth trajectories of fish separated by inbreeding and diet. data shown for growth periods prior to sexual maturity for  females,  males. blue triangles = outbred control diet, brown triangles = outbred low food diet, orange circles = inbred control diet, green circles = low food diet



we found some evidence for catch-up growth in mosquitofish. fish exposed to the low food diet took significantly longer to mature and although statistically they were significantly smaller at maturity, they were still very similar in size to control fish . females matured at a significantly larger size than males when on the control diet, but not when they were on the low food diet . females took significantly longer to reach maturity than did males. males on the low food diet matured on average 20 days later than those on the control diet, while females on the low food diet took 28 days longer to mature than those on the control diet. we did not find any statistically significant sex by diet interactions for time to, or size at maturity. on average, low diet treatment males matured at  <dig>  % of the size of the average control diet male and females matured at  <dig>  % of the size of the average control diet female .fig.  <dig> mean age and length at sexual maturity and 95 % confidence interval for fish separated by inbreeding, diet, and sex. o = outbred, i = inbred, triangles = females, circles = males, black = control diet, grey = low food diet. outbred control males n =  <dig>  outbred control females n =  <dig>  outbred low food diet males n =  <dig>  outbred low food diet females n =  <dig>  inbred control males n =  <dig>  inbred control females n =  <dig>  inbred low food diet males n =  <dig>  inbred low food diet females n = 104



finally, neither juvenile survival nor sex ratio at maturation was affected by diet .

discussion
the effects of inbreeding are expected to be exacerbated in stressful environments  <cit> . we tested this hypothesis by rearing inbred and outbred mosquitofish in two different food treatments  and measured their growth rate, size, age at maturity, and their ability to show compensatory growth and catch-up growth. our results revealed  no evidence for inbreeding depression in either the benign or more stressful rearing environments,  some evidence for catch-up growth, and  no evidence for compensatory growth.

we found no evidence for inbreeding depression for any of the measured traits . one reason that is often posited for a lack of inbreeding depression is that the expression of deleterious alleles depends on the environment an animal experiences  <cit> , including the conditions in which animals are raised  <cit> . for example, previous studies have shown effects on inbreeding in the presence of certain stressors , but not others . others have found a modest correlation between the extent of inbreeding depression and the level of dietary stress . our low food diet lead to almost zero growth over a three-week period and is thus comparable to a very harsh natural environment. the fact that we did not find effects of inbreeding depression in either of our experimental treatments, especially given our large sample size , is thus robust evidence that the traits we measured do not suffer inbreeding depression in gambusia holbrooki under the stressful conditions the fish experienced in this experiment . we have previously shown  <cit>  that this diet reduces male attractiveness and is therefore, by definition, stressful .

the presence and magnitude of inbreeding depression may differ depending on which life stages and/or traits are measured  <cit> . for example, some studies show no effect of inbreeding depression on body size, but do show an effect on time to development  <cit> . the traits we measured  are major life-history traits with large effects on fitness in many species  <cit>  that are therefore expected to be condition-dependent  <cit> . these traits should be particularly prone to inbreeding depression because condition is assumed to be affected by multiple loci across the genome  <cit> , so this result was somewhat surprising. one explanation for a lack of inbreeding effect is that maternal and family effects on fitness might overshadow effects associated with inbreeding  <cit>  due to high variance among families  <cit> . we can dismiss this explanation, however, as we explicitly controlled for sire, dam, and family effects. another explanation for a lack of inbreeding depression for the traits we measured is that mosquitofish have purged deleterious alleles for metabolic responses to low food availability as a result of periodic population bottlenecks  <cit> . in support of this, previous studies looking at the effects of inbreeding depression on population size and population growth rate under two different salinities in mosquitofish did not find evidence for inbreeding depression  <cit> . however, in our population we have directly shown that lower heterozygosity in males  leads to significantly lower reproductive success , suggesting that inbreeding does reduce fitness, but not because of its effects on adult size or growth rates.

we did not find any evidence of compensatory growth in our study. fish in the stressful low food environment did not show faster growth rates after food restriction early in life compared to fish on the control diet. this result, contrasts with that of livingston et al.  <cit>  who found partial compensatory growth for females, but it agrees with their findings for males. both studies used the same diet manipulation so the reasons for the difference are unclear. however, our findings are in accordance with the wider trend that fish generally show little evidence for compensatory growth compared to other taxa  <cit> . one reason that has been posited for this taxonomic difference is that ectotherms have indeterminate growth and are under less pressure to rapidly achieve a large final size than taxa with determinate growth. however, the evidence from mosquitofish does not support this explanation. male mosquitofish have determinate growth but do not show compensatory growth , while females have indeterminate growth but there is some evidence for compensatory growth . if we assume selection for large body size is comparable across the sexes  we would expect to see compensatory growth in males, but not females, if an explanation based on determinate versus indeterminate growth is correct.

although we did not observe compensatory growth in response to food deprivation, fish in the low food diet did mature at a very similar  size to those on the control diet because they delayed their maturation . similar results have been found for another poeciliid fish the guppy   <cit> . in these studies, guppies showed a reduction in growth rate, an increase in age at maturity, and a decrease in size at maturity after a period of reduced food availability. delaying maturation to achieve a larger adult size may be physiologically less costly than increasing growth rate  <cit> , but it could still reduce lifetime reproductive success if it leads to less time in the breeding pool  <cit> . the relative magnitude of these two costs could be important in determining whether species compensate for restricted growth during development by increasing their subsequent growth or by delaying maturation.

CONCLUSIONS
there was no interaction between inbreeding and diet restriction during development on juvenile survival, growth or size, and age at maturity. this indicates that these traits do not suffer from inbreeding depression, even after individuals are exposed to a seemingly stressful low food environment . it implies that how mosquitofish respond to a restricted diet during early development does not depend on phenotypic quality . of course, our results do not rule out that inbreeding depression occurs in g. holbrooki, nor do they exclude a g × e interaction between inbreeding and rearing environment. previous studies highlight that it is important to look at the effects of inbreeding over all life stages and for multiple traits  <cit> . looking at only single life stages or a limited set of traits may under- or overestimate the effects of inbreeding because it does not take into account potential trade-offs between life stages or traits  <cit> . for example, in mosquitofish, males that have a poor start in life  are less attractive to females than those reared on a control diet in simple two-choice mate association tests  <cit> . this illustrates the potential for hidden long-term costs of a stressful environment. furthermore, we reared fish individually , but this eliminates any potential for reduced social competitiveness to affect growth and adult size. perhaps most importantly, in a companion study we tested how the inbreeding status and diet treatment of males affect their ability to gain paternity when they compete for females in a socially competitive environment . we found that inbred males are significantly less successful, but that there is no effect of diet, nor any interaction between diet and inbreeding on male reproductive success. this suggests that inbreeding does ultimately reduce fitness and perhaps overrides the effect seen in attractiveness due to diet  <cit> . the current study indicates, however, that this is not because inbreeding affects adult size or growth rates. the proximate basis of inbreeding depression in male g. holbrooki therefore remains to be determined. one possibility that we are currently testing is that inbreeding lowers sperm competitiveness.
