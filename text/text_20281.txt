BACKGROUND
dysregulated apoptosis is a feature of cancer, where apoptosis resistance promotes tumour progression by giving cancer cells a survival advantage. for example, resistance to apoptosis induced by loss of adhesion signals allows cancer cells to metastasise  <cit> . moreover, intrinsic and acquired resistance to apoptosis are barriers to successful cancer treatments. understanding the mechanisms that control apoptosis under normal developmental settings is important in order to provide opportunities for designing novel anti-cancer therapeutics.

the mammary gland provides a paradigm to study mechanisms regulating developmental apoptosis  <cit> . during cycles of mammary gland development, the differentiated epithelial cells that produce milk in lactation undergo widespread apoptosis after weaning, as the gland involutes and remodels to a pre-pregnant state. elucidating the mechanisms that regulate the sensitivity of mammary epithelial cells  to apoptosis will provide insight into possible breast cancer targets  <cit> . currently the molecular basis of mammary involution is not fully understood. here we have examined the expression and possible role in mammary gland development of a central family of apoptosis regulators, the inhibitors-of-apoptosis-proteins .

iaps are endogenous apoptosis regulators, though recently they have been shown to have additional diverse roles in cell regulation  <cit> . iaps are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and are characterised by the presence of one or more baculovirus iap repeat  domains. the bir domains target iaps to bind and inhibit caspase function  <cit> . during cell death, the natural anti-apoptosis function of iaps is overcome via competition for their caspase-binding sites by smac and omi, as well as by ubiquitination  <cit> .

the  <dig> mammalian family members exhibit distinct patterns of tissue expression, however almost nothing is known about their expression and function during normal mammary gland development, although they are acknowledged to be frequently dysregulated in breast cancer  <cit> .

using quantitative pcr and immunoblotting we examined iap family member expression during post-pregnancy mammary gland development, and discovered that several iaps are down-regulated prior to the gland entering involution. we suggest that cell-autonomous regulation of iap expression might have a central role in sensitising mecs for apoptosis that occurs during involution of the tissue.

RESULTS
iap expression during mammary gland development
initial studies using rt-pcr were performed to identify which iaps are expressed in the mammary gland. bruce, c-iap <dig>  c-iap <dig>  naip <dig>  survivin and xiap were detected in mouse mammary gland at the time points examined . livin cdna was not detected at any of the time points, suggesting that it is not expressed in the mammary gland . the iap antagonists, smac and omi, were also present. thus most of the known iaps and their antagonists are transcribed in the mammary gland and are present throughout gland development. since rt-pcr does not reveal changes in levels of rna, we performed qpcr analysis. xiap, c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> were chosen for subsequent analysis because they have roles in breast cancer progression  <cit> .

the transition from lactation to involution marks the period in development during which substantial and synchronous induction of apoptosis occurs. we hypothesised previously that the epithelial cells in lactating mammary gland might become primed for rapid apoptosis by alterations in the levels of apoptosis regulators during lactation  <cit> . to determine whether the levels of iaps changed from pregnancy to lactation and/or during involution, we carried out qpcr analysis between the end of pregnancy and  <dig> hours of involution. during this time the predominant cells are mecs, and these are the cells that undergo apoptosis at involution. in the mouse, cell death begins within  <dig> hours of involution, and tissue remodelling occurs from ~ <dig> hours  <cit> .

the levels of xiap mrna decreased between pregnancy day  <dig> and lactation day  <dig>  as the gland entered involution, the relative xiap transcript abundance remained low during the initial phase of cell death  and then returned to the level observed at pregnancy day  <dig> as tissue remodelling began  . c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> transcript levels were highest at the end of pregnancy  and then decreased considerably as the glands entered lactation. the levels then decreased further as the gland entered involution, with expression been lowest at  <dig> hrs of involution .

to determine if the changes in iap expression at the rna level reflected changes at the protein level, we examined iap expression by immunoblotting. stat <dig>  caspases and claudin- <dig> were used as markers for the key developmental stages in mammary gland development. activation of the transcription factor stat <dig> immediately follows the cessation of suckling and is required for the onset of involution  <cit> . stat <dig> phosphorylation was not evident during pregnancy and lactation, but occurred within  <dig> hours of involution and remained for at least the following  <dig> hours . caspases are activated during apoptosis and are responsible for cell degradation  <cit> . expressed as inactive zymogens, caspase cleavage  indicates that activation has occurred. caspase- <dig> levels decreased at involution  <dig> hours and remained low until involution  <dig> hours; caspase- <dig> is activated by caspase- <dig> and its cleaved form was detected at involution  <dig> and  <dig> hours . finally, claudin- <dig> is an epithelial tight junction component expressed by mammary epithelial cells and thought to be involved in regulating cell-ecm interactions  <cit> . its levels remained equal from pregnancy through to  <dig> hours of involution, and then showed a marked decrease as the gland entered the tissue remodelling stage .

thus our samples represent stages in the progression of mammary gland involution; stat <dig> and caspase- <dig> become activated within  <dig> hours; death becomes maximal at around 48- <dig> hours with high levels of caspase- <dig> activated; and the tissue remodeling begins at  <dig> hours post-weaning. we next examined iap expression during this time course.

xiap protein levels remained constant between the end of pregnancy and early lactation, but decreased at lactation day  <dig> . xiap protein levels remained low until involution  <dig> hours when they then returned to a pre-lactational level. thus, xiap protein is expressed at low levels in the late lactating mammary gland prior to the onset of cell death. the protein profile is similar to the mrna level, but does not follow it precisely, suggesting that xiap is regulated by both rna and protein processing during post-pregnancy mammary gland development.

c-iap <dig> protein expression was highest at pregnancy day  <dig> and decreased considerably by lactation day  <dig> . in contrast, c-iap <dig> levels remained unchanged between pregnancy day  <dig> and lactation day  <dig>  but became undetectable by the time that the gland entered involution . expression of both c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> then remained undetectable throughout involution. the protein level of c-iap <dig> closely matched the qpcr profile, suggesting that c-iap <dig> expression is regulated at the level of transcription in post-pregnancy development. although the changes in transcript abundance of c-iap <dig> closely matched that of c-iap <dig>  the c-iap <dig> protein level decreased later on in lactation, which implies that the c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> proteins are subjected to different modes of regulation in the mammary gland.

finally, to determine whether the changes in iap expression observed in vivo were due to altered expression in the mammary epithelial cells, rather than reduced levels of stromal components such as adipocytes, we examined iap levels in primary mecs immediately after isolation from the intact tissue. quantitative pcr analysis using primers targeted against the adipocyte-specific genes perilipin a and adiponectin, demonstrated that the purification of p18mecs had successfully removed any adipocytes that are present in the mammary gland tissue at this time  . rt-pcr and immunoblotting analysis showed that xiap and ciap <dig> were indeed expressed in p18mecs . we next compared iap expression in mecs isolated from pregnancy day  <dig> and lactation day  <dig> mice . consistent with our in vivo data, both xiap and c-iap <dig> levels were lower at lactation day  <dig> compared with pregnancy day  <dig> . together, these data confirm that expression of iaps in mammary epithelial cells themselves decreases as the gland approaches involution.

importantly, our results show that down-regulation of iaps in vivo precedes initiator caspase activation. because iaps promote cell survival, the data support a model in which the mammary gland becomes primed for involution during the prior developmental stage of lactation.

xiap down-regulation occurs in primary mec cultures
since xiap is a potent inhibitor of caspases, we hypothesised that its down-regulation might be a mechanism to prime cells in vivo for subsequent apoptosis. it is unlikely that xiap down-regulation alone would cause apoptosis as xiap null mice are viable. to test this hypothesis, we determined if xiap down-regulation is caused by factors that promote apoptosis in mecs.

one factor contributing to apoptosis induction in the mammary gland is suppression of growth factor signalling  <cit> . we therefore cultured primary mecs in the absence of growth factors, and in the presence of the egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor, iressa  <cit> . cleaved caspase- <dig> was detected within  <dig> hours of growth factor withdrawal . at this time, ~20% of the cells were apoptotic . addition of iressa to the growth factor-free media had no further effect on apoptosis, indicating that growth factor withdrawal is sufficient to induce apoptosis.

the loss of growth factor signalling caused xiap levels to decrease by ~25% and ~40% after  <dig> and  <dig> hours, respectively . although iressa did not elevate apoptosis, it caused a greater decrease in the xiap levels compared with growth factor withdrawal alone; 55% and 70% after  <dig> and  <dig> hours, respectively. these data demonstrate that xiap is down-regulated during the course of growth-factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis in mecs.

since xiap down-regulation coincided with caspase activation, it was important to examine whether it was dependent or independent of active caspases. treatment of serum-deprived mecs with the pan-caspase inhibitor zvad did not rescue the decline in xiap levels seen after serum withdrawal . moreover, neither egf nor insulin prevented xiap down-regulation, even though they protected mecs from apoptosis, as judged by the levels of active caspase  <dig> .

together, these data indicate that the decline in xiap levels is independent of caspase activity, and cannot be rescued by egf or insulin/igf signalling.

interestingly, we found that xiap down-regulation was a common feature of mec apoptosis, as withdrawal of ecm-dependent survival signals  and the kinase inhibitor staurosporine , both induced xiap down-regulation .

xiap protects mammary epithelial cells from apoptosis
since the xiap protein level decreased prior to mammary gland involution, as well as in primary mec cultures following serum withdrawal, we reasoned that xiap reduction might contribute to the apoptosis execution programme, rather than being a consequence of it.

to test this hypothesis, we used the mec line fsk <dig> , to determine if exogenous xiap could protect cells from apoptosis induced by the various stimuli. fsk <dig> cells behaved similarly to primary mec regarding apoptosis and xiap down-regulation in response to all apoptotic stimuli tested   <cit> .

cells were transfected with either rfp alone or rfp-tagged xiap  and then treated with apoptosis inducer. cells treated with sts showed the expected increase in apoptosis after  <dig> and  <dig> hours, which was rescued by rfpxiap . similarly, rfpxiap prevented apoptosis induced by iressa   <cit> .

these data demonstrate that xiap is capable of inhibiting apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli. furthermore, they suggest that the down-regulation of xiap contributes to rapid execution of the apoptotic programme. this conclusion is supported by other studies where we have shown that reducing xiap levels by sirna does not directly induce apoptosis in mecs, rather it sensitises cells to apoptosis inducers  <cit> .

discussion
in this study, we have demonstrated that the iap family members; bruce, c-iap <dig>  c-iap <dig>  xiap, naip- <dig> and survivin are all expressed in the mouse mammary gland, and that xiap, c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> are differentially expressed at different stages during the post-pregnancy development of the tissue. moreover in cultured mecs, xiap levels decrease in response to apoptosis stimuli, while exogenous xiap protects mecs from apoptosis.

of particular interest is that expression of xiap, c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> all decrease during lactation, prior to the onset of apoptosis at involution. these data support our previous work on the levels of bcl- <dig> family proteins, where we showed that the potent anti-apoptotic proteins, bcl- <dig>  bcl-xl and bcl-w all decreased during lactation and conversely, that the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins bak and bad increased  <cit> . it is important to stress that these global changes in expression of apoptosis regulators in the mammary gland occur prior to the induction of apoptosis at involution. we therefore propose that major changes occur in the apoptosis machinery during lactation in order to prepare epithelial cells for rapid execution as the mammary gland enters involution. these changes in the expression profiles of apoptosis regulators in the absence of cell death indicates that cells employ multiple levels of control beyond bona fide cell death regulators to govern their fate  <cit> . currently, we do not know what the mechanisms are that lead to altered iap levels, though they occur through changes in both mrna and protein levels. a current focus is to explore the relative roles of transcriptional control as well as protein stability in regulating iaps in the mammary gland.

our data also provide insight into the lack of any overt apoptosis phenotype in xiap, c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> null mice, as it shows that cells can withstand the loss of one or more of these apoptosis regulators and remain viable. however, iap regulation does control the sensitivity of cells to death stimuli, and we suggest that decreasing iap levels during lactation may sensitise the cells to the pro-apoptotic signals they will receive as involution is initiated  <cit> . this idea is supported by other cases where changes in iap expression correlate with changes in sensitivity to apoptosis  <cit> .

the onset of mammary involution is determined by the co-ordinated regulation of multiple signalling pathways  <cit> . in addition to down-regulating pro-survival proteins , many pro-apoptotic proteins, such as death receptors and associated ligands  are upregulated at the onset of involution  <cit> . we suggest that altered levels of iaps might influence the efficiency of their apoptosis signalling.

recently, xiap has been shown to regulate cell sensitivity to fas-induced apoptosis  <cit> . fas activates the extrinsic  apoptosis pathway leading to caspase- <dig> activation. in most cells  this is insufficient to kill the cell unless the intrinsic  pathway is activated by caspase-dependent cleavage of bid to form tbid. however, xiap null cells can be killed by fas even in the absence of bid. fas and its ligand fasl are both expressed in mammary gland by involution  <dig> hours, thus reduced xiap expression might allow a more robust response to the fas death signal  <cit> . indeed, we have previously demonstrated that lowering xiap levels in mecs by sirna dramatically enhances their apoptotic response to the related ligand trail  <cit> .

tnfα expression is also induced early during involution  <cit> . interestingly, tnfα can activate either pro-survival or pro-apoptotic signals, but it is not known how mammary epithelial cells co-ordinate the response to tnfα. c-iap <dig> and c-iap <dig> regulate cell sensitivity to tnfα-induced apoptosis, with the down-regulation of c-iaps associated with a pro-apoptotic response  <cit> . thus mecs may down-regulate c-iaps during lactation to ensure a pro-apoptotic response to tnfα when the signal is received in involution.

approximately 90% of mammary epithelium dies during involution. most of these cells are alveolar mecs; however the ductal mecs survive to re-populate the gland in subsequent pregnancies. it is not known what determines which cells survive involution, but the intense pro-apoptotic signalling at this time suggests that they have increased resistance to apoptotic signals. interestingly, at  <dig> hours of involution xiap mrna and protein expression return to pre-lactational levels. the mechanism for this increase in xiap expression is not known. one possibility is that it may be due to increased nf-κb signalling at this time during development, as xiap is a target of nf-κb  <cit> . of note, nf-κb can inhibit apoptosis in mecs, and therefore it is possible that nf-κb mediates its protection on the mammary epithelium in part through up-regulation of xiap. conversely, xiap can activate nf-κb signalling and thus the increase in xiap during involution could represent part of a pro-survival feedback that protects the remaining epithelium from undergoing apoptosis  <cit> .

many breast cancer cells display resistance to apoptotic stimuli and interestingly, also have elevated iap expression  <cit> . thus, it will be important in the future to determine if ductal mecs retain high iap expression levels as a mechanism of evading death during involution, as this may provide insight into breast cancer formation.

CONCLUSIONS
cells have developed multiple mechanisms to down-regulate iaps during apoptosis, indicating that removing iaps is advantageous to ensure that apoptosis occurs. our model of involution is that terminal differentiation of luminal cells may include changes in transcription and post-translational control of apoptosis-regulating proteins, to allow the cells to be efficiently cleared from the gland by apoptosis during involution. we would therefore argue that the down-regulation of iaps and bcl- <dig> proteins prior to involution in the mammary gland, is a developmental mechanism that promotes the efficient execution of unwanted cells at weaning.
