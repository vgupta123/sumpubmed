BACKGROUND
maize centromeres are enriched in the tandem centromeric satellite repeat centc and centromeric retrotransposons . the centromeric retrotransposons of maize  are characterized by an integrase that contains a cr motif  <cit> , and elements belonging to subfamilies crm <dig>  crm <dig> and crm <dig> integrate predominantly at the centromeres of corn  <cit> . recombinant elements have been identified within the crm <dig> and crm <dig> subfamilies  <cit> . the exact role of the centc and crm elements in corn centromeres remains unknown.

tandem repeats are major constituents of higher eukaryotic genomes and are typically localized to specialized chromosomal regions such as centromeres, telomeres,  and heterochromatic knobs  <cit> . satellite repeats are thought to play a role in organizing and stabilizing these specialized chromosomal features, which are important for chromosome behavior during cell division  <cit> . in addition to noncoding satellite repeats, many genes, such as histones and ribosomal rna genes, are amplified and arrayed in tandem on chromosome arms. these tandemly arrayed genes  are thought to provide the large quantities of protein or rna products required for important physiological and biological functions  <cit> .

while some satellite repeats are chromosome-specific, others are more broadly distributed. in maize, the  <dig> nt cent <dig> satellite repeat is localized near the centromere of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , while the  <dig> nt centromere specific satellite repeat centc is present at all centromeres  <cit> . the 180 bp  <cit>  and 360 bp tr <dig> tandem knob repeats  <cit>  were detected on all eight maize chromosomes analyzed, although their copy number on different chromosomes varies greatly  <cit> .

many satellite repeat arrays and tags seem to undergo concerted evolution by sequence homogenization. random homology-dependent unequal crossovers  <cit> , replication slippage followed by unequal crossing over  <cit> , rolling circle replication of extrachromosomal circular dnas  <cit> , segmental duplication  <cit> , and gene conversion  <cit>  have all been proposed to account for the sequence homogeneity, higher order structure, as well as rapid expansion and contraction of tandem arrays.

the origin of novel satellite repeats, however, remains elusive. tandem repeats with homology to parts of retrotransposons have been identified in several plants, e.g., wheat, rye  <cit> , and potato  <cit> . the cent <dig> tandem repeat of maize has homology to telomeric repeat, knob repeat, and the b chromosome centromere  <cit> . tandem repeats with homology to intergenic spacer of ribosomal dna have been described in several plants, including potato  <cit> , common bean  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , and tomato  <cit> .

here we report the discovery and characterization of two cr-derived tandem repeats, describe the sequence features shared by them, and propose molecular mechanisms responsible for their generation, amplification and homogenization.

RESULTS
crm1tr – a crm1-derived tandem repeat
tandem repeats crm1tr and crm4tr were discovered serendipitously during blast searches of maize genome and cdna sequences, respectively. crm1tr is a tandem repeat of maize derived from the maize centromeric retrotransposon subfamily crm <dig>  full length crm1tr monomers have up to 97% sequence similarity to a segment of ltr-utr of crm1b retrotransposon . in maize inbred b <dig>  crm1tr repeat arrays are located at two loci in the pericentromere of chromosome  <dig> that are separated by ~ <dig>  mb: locus i spans coordinates  <dig> ,796- <dig> , <dig> of refgen_v <dig>  which is covered by two overlapping bacs , while locus ii lies between  <dig> , <dig> - <dig> , <dig> . all three bacs contain centromeric retrotransposons crm <dig> and crm <dig>  which indicates that these regions were at some point part of the functional centromere. bac c0393i <dig> is located at the edge of centromere and part of this bac and some crm1tr arrays therein are associated with centromere specific histone h <dig> variant cenh <dig> in the maize inbred b <dig> .

crm1tr arrays are organized into  <dig> uninterrupted tandem arrays, or islands:  <dig> islands at locus i and  <dig> islands at locus ii. these islands are separated from each other either by gaps in the physical assembly or by intervening sequences, e.g. ltr retrotransposons. we identified at least  <dig> full length ltr retrotransposon insertions, dated between  <dig>  to  <dig>  my , within crm1tr arrays at locus i. this indicates that the locus i crm1tr arrays originated around the time of the allotetraploidization event that resulted in modern day corn  <cit> . no full-length retrotransposon insertions were detected within locus ii crm1tr arrays, suggesting that locus i is older than locus ii, that retrotransposons are more efficiently removed from, or less likely to insert into, locus ii.

we extracted a total of  <dig> full-length  crm1tr monomers . detailed sequence analysis of these monomers revealed that a typical crm1tr monomer contains ~ <dig> nt start sequence  at its 5′ end, one to four tandem copies of an internal repeat  of ~ <dig> nt, and one of two end sequences at its 3′ end, the ~ <dig> nt eb or ~ <dig> nt ea .

locus i crm1tr monomers have the general structure ‘s-ir-eb’ while those from locus ii have the general structure s-ir*-ea/eb, where ir* indicates between  <dig> to  <dig> tandem copies of ir and ea/eb indicates either ea or eb. most  locus ii crm1tr monomers have three tandem copies of ir sequence. other locus ii crm1tr monomers have either four , two , or one  ir sequence. consequently, locus ii monomers are longer  and more variable in length than locus i monomers  . figure 2a illustrates the structure of crm1tr monomers as well as their arrangement at locus i and locus ii.

distinct haplotypes at the two crm1tr loci suggest local homogenization
to investigate the sequence homogenization within and across crm1tr arrays, we analyzed diagnostic variant nucleotides  within ‘s’ and ‘ir’ sequences from fl-crm1tr monomers. a set of seven snps within ‘s’ distinguishes monomers from locus i and ii . based on these snps, the s sequences from  <dig> locus i crm1tr monomers were grouped into  <dig> haplotypes and those from  <dig> locus ii crm1tr monomers were grouped into  <dig> haplotypes. most s sequences from locus i crm1tr monomers  are of the haplotype ‘acggagt’ while most of those at locus ii are of the haplotype ‘gtcactc’  or ‘gccgctc’  .

no haplotypes of ‘s’ were shared between locus i and ii, but, a search of the htgs database of genbank using the consensus s sequences of locus i and locus ii identified the respective parent bac as the best match followed by the bac corresponding to the other crm1tr locus. this suggests that the s haplotypes at the two crm1tr loci, though distinct, are more closely related to each other than to any full-length crm element in sequenced maize genome and may even have originated from the same ancestral sequence.

for ir haplotype analysis, we used all locus i crm1tr monomers but only those locus ii monomers with three ir copies. the ir sequences contains a terminal a-rich region that is approximately  <dig> nt long in locus i monomers and ~ <dig> nt long in locus ii monomers . this a-rich region was not included in snp analysis because it is highly polymorphic. a set of  <dig> snps distinguished ir sequences from locus i and ii. based on these snps, the  <dig> ‘ir’ sequences from  <dig> locus i monomers were grouped into  <dig> haplotypes, whereas the  <dig> ‘ir’ sequences from  <dig> ‘ir’ locus ii monomers were grouped into  <dig> haplotypes. most ir sequences from locus i monomers are of the haplotype cacccta  or caccctc  . position specific ir haplotypes were detected in locus ii monomers with three ir repeats, i.e. haplotype cacctct dominates at the first ir, ir.c <dig> , the related haplotypes tgaccta  or tgacctc  dominate at the second ir, ir.c <dig>  and the related haplotypes tgatcta  or tgatctc  dominate at the third ir, ir.c <dig> . this position specificity was absent in monomers with one, two or four irs. for instance, the ir.c <dig> haplotype tgatcta is located at the second ir in  <dig> of  <dig> monomers with two irs and at the fourth ir in  <dig> of  <dig> monomers with four irs . these data suggests crm1tr monomers with one, two, or four irs likely originated from crm1tr monomers with three irs via recombination.

the two ir haplotypes present in the majority of locus i monomers are also represented at locus ii, albeit only in three locus ii monomers, i.e. locus i haplotype caccctc also matches the first ir of a one ir and a two ir containing monomer at locus ii, and locus i haplotype caccctc matches the first ir of a two ir containing monomer at locus ii. nonetheless, all three ir copies from locus ii that share haplotype with locus i monomers can be distinguished from locus i monomers based on their shorter a rich region at the termini, which is similar to other locus ii monomers. these data may be indicative of a common origin of the two crm1tr loci or a low level of intrachromosomal gene conversion between the two crm1tr loci.

distinct s and ir haplotypes at the two crm1tr loci suggests that crm1tr monomers are locally homogenized, and that the two loci followed separate evolutionary trajectories. this is reminiscent of centromeric satellites in arabidopsis, where repeats derived from the same genomic locus were discovered to be more similar to each other than those from disparate genomic regions  <cit> . similarly, analysis of centromeric repeats in human x chromosomes revealed that repeats that are near each other  were significantly more similar than those at random loci either on the same or different x chromosomes  <cit> .

crm1tr monomers containing three ir originated from existing crm1s
to assess whether the three irs present in most locus ii crm1tr monomers formed de novo or originated from existing crm <dig> elements, we searched the htgs database of genbank for crm <dig> elements with multiple copies of the ir sequence. most full length crm1b retrotransposons contain a single ir copy that is similar in sequence to the ir sequence in locus i crm1tr monomers, but we discovered at least two full length crm <dig> copies  that contain three irs similar in sequence to the three irs in most locus ii crm1tr monomers. snps shared between the ir regions of the two crm1b elements and the consensus sequence of locus ii crm1tr monomers  suggest that the three irs in most locus ii monomers originated from existing crm1b elements rather than by de novo triplication of ir sequence within locus ii crm1tr monomers.

crm1tr monomer end variant ea originated by gene conversion
locus ii crm1tr monomers contain one of the two end variants, ea or eb . sequence comparison to crm <dig> a and crm <dig> b parent alleles revealed that s, ir and eb sections of crm1tr are more similar to crm1b and that only ea is more similar to crm1a . moreover, none of the full length crm1b elements in the genbank htgs database contain the ea sequence, suggesting that the crm1tr repeat originated from a crm1b element, and that monomers with ea originated at locus ii by replacement of eb with the crm1a derived ea sequence. these recombinant ea containing monomers account for the majority of  of crm1tr monomers at locus ii. conservation of crm1b derived sequence both upstream and downstream of ea suggests that ea replaced eb via a gene conversion event. snp analysis indicates that an at least 71 bp  region of the crm1tr repeat was converted to a crm1a type sequence. sequences upstream  and downstream  of this 71 bp region are ~96% and 100% identical to the crm1a consensus sequence, respectively. in yeast, the gene conversion rate is known to increase with the length of homologous region, and as little as 13 bp of flanking homologous sequence appears to be sufficient for gene conversion  <cit> . gene conversion events via the double strand break repair pathway result in short conversion tracts of 1–2 kb  <cit> , though much shorter conversion tracts have been observed for gene conversion events involving repeats  <cit> .

identity of subsequences from crm1tr monomers at the two crm1tr loci  to the two crm <dig> subfamily variants crm1a and crm1b is shown in bitscores. note that all subsequences of crm1tr i.e. s, ir variants  and eb have high homology to crm1b, except end sequence variant ea, which is more similar to crm1a.

crm4tr - a crm <dig> derived tandem repeat
crm4tr is derived from a member of the crm <dig> subfamily. full length crm4tr monomers share between 95-98% sequence homology to a ~ <dig> nt ltr-utr segment  of the full length crm4b retrotransposon consensus sequence . crm4tr repeat arrays are located at a single genomic locus spanning coordinates  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> on chr  <dig> of refgen_v <dig>  crm4tr arrays are located in the pericentromeric region spanned by two overlapping bacs  that lack centc as well as other centromere enriched retrotransposons crm1/2/ <dig> and are located ~ <dig>  mb from the functional centromere .

crm4tr arrays are organized into  <dig> islands separated by either gaps in the physical assembly or intervening sequences, including ltr retrotransposons. we identified two nested insertions of retrotransposon a <dig>  in opposite orientation between the first two islands and estimated their insertion times at  <dig>  my  and  <dig>  my , suggesting that this crm4tr array has existed in the maize genome for at least ~ <dig> my and may have formed more recently than crm1tr locus i.

the 39 fl-crm4tr monomers from the crm4tr locus range in length from 1369– <dig> nt . crm4tr consensus sequence contains roughly  <dig> repetitions of ~ <dig> nt sequence near its 3′ end . based on shared snps, repeats  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> form group  <dig>  repeats  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> form group  <dig>  and repeats  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> form group  <dig>  these repeats thus form at least two sets of ~ <dig> nt composite repeat, where set i includes composite pairs 2– <dig>  4– <dig>  6– <dig> and set ii includes composite pairs 8– <dig>  10– <dig>  and 12– <dig> .

crm1tr versus crm4tr
crm1tr and crm4tr repeats include part of their parent elements’ ltr and utr, but the relative start sites in the crm <dig> and crm <dig> ltrs differ. the 5′ end of crm4tr monomers lies ~ <dig> nt upstream of tata box, and therefore in the u <dig>  and includes several motifs conserved between the crm <dig> and crm <dig> ltrs, i.e. the tata box, recombination breakpoint , and the c-rich and t-rich motifs . in contrast, the 5′ end of crm1tr monomers is located ~ <dig> nt downstream of tata box in the u <dig> region and thus lacks all of the sequence motifs listed above.

remarkably, crm1tr and crm4tr monomers terminate at similar locations within their respective utrs. a  <dig> nt region of crm1b utr is homologous  to a  <dig> nt region of the crm <dig> utr. crm1tr and crm4tr monomers terminate within  <dig> nucleotides of each other, i.e. at position  <dig> and  <dig> respectively within this homologous region. the first  <dig> nucleotides and the terminal  <dig> nt of the homologous region are 72% and 83% identical between crm <dig> and crm <dig>  the terminal  <dig> nt of the homologous region also contains a polypurine rich region . the conserved ~  <dig> nt utr region was not detected in crm <dig> 

crm1tr and crm4tr repeats are transcribed
a genbank search revealed one crm1tr- and one crm4tr-derived est spanning the junction between two monomers . in addition,  <dig> full length cdnas  originating from crm4tr repeats were detected in two different cdna libraries . these ests and cdna clones were prepared from polyadenylated rna. all three crm4tr derived cdnas had spliced out most of the utr region and one cdna had an additional splice in the ltr . the 5′ ends of the three crm4tr derived fl-cdnas are located  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nt downstream of tata box in the crm4tr monomers. no crm1tr-derived full length cdnas was detected, which may reflect the lack of a tata box and other regulatory regions required for transcription by rna polymerase ii. the impact or role, if any, of the inclusion or exclusion of transcription regulatory signal in crm4tr and crm1tr on local chromatin organization and/or function is unclear. although, the role, if any, of non-coding polyadenylated transcripts in plant heterochromatin formation remains largely unknown, a recent study in arabidopsis showed that rna polymerase ii transcription recruits pol iv and pol v at heterochromatic loci to promote sirna biogenesis and sirna-mediated transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> .

discussion
repeated creation of tandem repeats from cr elements
the maize genome contains hundreds of full-length centromeric retrotransposons belonging to six different subfamilies   <cit>  . three of these  have the ability to target their insertion to the functional centromeres as defined by cenh <dig>  <cit> . maize centromeres also contain the tandem repeat centc, which shares high sequence homology with the cento repeat found at rice centromeres  <cit> , indicating that this centromeric repeat likely has resided at the centromeres of these two species since they diverged about  <dig> my. it is not clear how these tandem centromeric repeats arose, but the discovery of tandem repeats derived from crm <dig> and crm <dig> raises the possibility that centc and cento may have been derived from ancient centromeric retrotransposons.

crm1tr and crm4tr were created in at least two independent events. the two crm1tr loci on the other hand seem to have a common origin at least  <dig> my. the localization of crm1tr at only two neighboring loci separated by ~ <dig>  mb on chr <dig> suggests that the second crm1tr locus originated either by retrotransposon insertions and/or other genomic rearrangement that separated the original cluster into two, or by intrachromosomal gene conversion events that transferred some crm1tr repeat to the second locus possibly by recombination with a crm <dig> sequence. several studies in yeast indicate that intrachromosomal gene conversion events are frequent and may result in long conversion tracts  <cit> .

transposable elements are a major source of tandem repeats although a few cases of acquisition of satellite repeat monomers by transposable elements have also been reported. roughly one quarter of all minisatellites/satellites in the human genome are derived from transposable elements  <cit> . the creation of tandem repeats from retrotransposons, including cr elements, has been documented a number of times. for example, at least four of the centromeric repeats in potato are amplified from retrotransposon-related sequences  <cit>  and the  <dig>  kb monomer of sobo satellite repeat of wild potato, which spans ~360 kb in the chromosome  <dig> pericentromere, shares sequence similarity with the ltrs of sore <dig> gypsy retrotransposon, satellite repeat, and genomic dna  <cit> . in rodent, the 348 bp monomer of satellite repeat rpcs shares sequence identity with the u <dig> region of the ltr of the rous sarcoma virus, and contains several sequence elements that are characteristic of retroviral ltrs such as a polypurine tract, ccaat boxes, a tata box and putative polyadenylation signals, as well as binding sites for the ccaat/enhancer-binding protein  and ccaat proteins related to nf- <dig>  <cit> . in rye, the satellite repeat family e <dig> has sequence derived from a ty3-gypsy retrotransposon while the d <dig> family contains a rearranged mite element  <cit> . in wheat and rye, a centromeric repeat with 250 bp repeat unit has 53% amino acid sequence similarity to the cereba  gag gene containing caa microsatellite  <cit>  and the satellite  <dig> family of xenopus laevis has homology to a sines  <cit> . satellite sequences with homology to the 3′ utr regions of plant retrotransposons belonging to the tat-lineage, which frequently contain variable tandem repeats, have been identified in several plant species  <cit> .

in some cases, partial homology between satellite repeats and retrotransposons has been attributed to acquisition and dispersal of satellite repeat sequence by transposable elements. for example, in drosophila, direct terminal repeats of the functional pdv elements might have been derived from the pvb <dig> satellite dna family through insertion of a tandemly repeated 36-bp transcription unit  <cit> . similarly, acquisition and subsequent dispersal of part of a tcast satellite dna sequence into a retro transposon is proposed to explain the distribution of tcast element in the vicinity of genes within euchromatin  <cit> .

similar regions of cr elements give rise to tandem repeats
we have discovered several parallels between crm1tr and crm4tr, which may begin to provide some clues about the transitioning process from autonomous retrotransposon to tandem repeat. first, it is noteworthy that the only crm subfamilies that gave rise to tandem repeats are those for which recombinant elements have been documented  <cit> . the crm <dig> and crm <dig> recombinants were postulated to have arisen from nested insertions of related elements, which suggests that the cr tandem repeats may also have arisen from nested insertions. second, similar regions of the parental crm element  gave rise to the tandem repeats in each case, indicating perhaps that similar mechanisms were involved in the creation and maintenance of these tandem repeats. third, all three crm-derived tandem repeat loci lie in the centromere or pericentromere, regions that are likely subject to large physical forces and possibly frequent chromosome breakage.

initiation of tandem repeats by illegitimate recombination
we propose that crm-derived tandem arrays arose from a ltr-utr~ltr structure . the utr~ltr junction may have formed via intrastrand illegitimate recombination events within a single  or between nested elements. since the short direct repeats required for formation of utr~ltr junction via single illegitimate recombination event were not detected in crm1b and crm4b consensus sequences , sequential recombinations would have been required. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that an alternative recombination mechanism akin to an atypical non-homologous end-joining may have generated the splice forming the utr~ltr junction, as there is evidence that non-homologous end joining can be accompanied by long deletions  <cit> . dna sequence likely played a role in defining the crm1tr and crm4tr monomers’ 3′ termini that map to roughly the same site within a segment of utr conserved between the crm1b and crm4b.

amplification of crm-derived tandem repeats by gene conversion
the fact that crm-derived repeats are located in or near the centromeres—chromosomal loci where meiotic crossing over is suppressed but gene conversions are frequent  <cit> — suggest that crm-derived repeats were amplified and homogenized primarily by non-allelic/interlocus gene conversion . the amenability of these tandem repeat loci to gene conversion in general is further evidenced by our discovery of recombinant crm1tr monomer such as those having replaced their crm1b type ends with a crm1a derived sequence. however, we cannot exclude that other mechanisms such as unequal exchange between sister chromatids   <cit>  as well as insertions of the products of rolling circle replication of an extrachromosomal circular dna  <cit>  may have also contributed to the amplification and homogenization of crm –derived repeats.

crm-derived tandem repeats – a path to centromeric repeats?
the presence of megabase spanning satellite repeats is a hallmark of centromeres, although there is little detectable sequence conservation. for example, in oryza brachyantha the centromeric satellite cento has been replaced with cento-f, which has no sequence similarity to cento, since divergence from o. sativa about 10– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . centromere specific satellite repeats that span nearly the entire core of six potato centromeres, are composed of long monomers . four of these six centromeric repeats are derived from retrotransposon-related sequences  <cit> . array sizes of centromere and knob repeats vary substantially in different maize inbreds  <cit> , and maize centromeres have been described as dynamic loci that can shift their position over time away from centromeric satellite repeats  <cit> . although the function of centromeric repeats is still unknown, it may be to preferentially bind nucleosomes containing the centromeric histone variant cenh <dig>  <cit> . cenh <dig> has been characterized as a protein that evolves rapidly, possibly in concert with centromeric dna  <cit> . in vitro nucleosome reconstitution experiments suggest that centc and the ltr/utr region of crm sequences preferentially bind cenh <dig> nucleosomes . taken together with these facts, the discovery of crm-derived tandem repeats suggest a mechanism by which the centromeric satellite repeats can be renewed or replaced using rapidly evolving retrotransposon sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, crm1tr and crm4tr represent the first tandem repeats derived entirely from single parental retrotransposons. the fact that these repeats arose independently from similar regions of two centromeric retrotransposon subfamilies and exhibit high sequence homology  to their extant parental retrotransposons suggests that the primary dna sequence of these ltr/utr regions have characteristics that favor illegitimate recombination and gene conversion. the discovery of tandem repeats originating from centromeric retrotransposons, some of which are enriched in cenh <dig> domains, raises the intriguing possibility that centromeric satellite repeats can be renewed or replaced by novel satellite repeats derived from retrotransposons belonging to the cr family.
