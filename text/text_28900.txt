BACKGROUND
in cattle, the majority of pregnancy loss is attributed to early embryonic loss prior to maternal recognition of pregnancy  <cit> , which occurs by approximately day  <dig> following conception  <cit> . during this period, following successful fertilization, the developing embryo enters the uterus on days  <dig> to  <dig> and forms a blastocyst by day  <dig>  following hatching of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida , the conceptus  becomes ovoid in shape. conceptus elongation is initiated by days  <dig> to  <dig>  and is characterized by a period of rapid growth of the trophectoderm cells that is completed by days  <dig> to  <dig>  elongation of the conceptus requires molecules that are transported or secreted by the luminal  and glandular  epithelial cells of the uterine endometrium  <cit> . these secretions make up the uterine lumen fluid , and include proteins, amino acids, lipids, glucose and ions, which are required for successful elongation, as evidenced by the failure of blastocysts to elongate in vivo in the uterine gland knock out ewe  <cit>  and the inability to replicate elongation in vitro in cattle  <cit> .

one of the pre-requisites for establishing a uterine environment capable of supporting conceptus elongation is an adequate post-ovulatory rise in circulating progesterone  concentrations. in both cattle and sheep, elevated p <dig> in the post-ovulatory period results in advanced conceptus elongation  <cit> . as a consequence, the elongating conceptus produces more interferon-tau  which is detectable in the uterine lumen  <cit>  and which is associated with increased pregnancy rates  <cit> . the effects of p <dig> do not directly affect the developing embryo  <cit>  but act indirectly by altering the transcriptome of the endometrium and subsequently the composition of the ulf  <cit> .

one of the strategies employed to identify molecules that regulate conceptus elongation in ruminants has been to characterize the temporal changes in endometrial gene expression during the period when conceptus elongation occurs, and to infer from the localization of transcripts whether the proteins for which they encode contribute to the composition of the ulf. in sheep, genes localized to the uterine le and superficial glandular epithelium  have been associated with  <dig> main classes of molecules:  proteins that are detectable in the uterine luminal fluid ,  enzymes that produce constituents of the ulf  and  active transporters of ulf molecules . to date, detailed data on ulf composition in cattle are scarce, although some studies have detected the protein products of a small number of genes encoding for secreted proteins in the ulf including igfbp <dig>  <cit> , retinol binding protein  <cit> , legumain and timp <dig>  <cit> . caution in extrapolating the abundant data on ulf composition confirmed in sheep  <cit>  to the bovine model is required. for example, despite the similarities in the transcriptomic changes that occur during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy, discrepancies in expression exist, as exemplified by lgals <dig>  which has a functional role in early pregnancy in sheep  <cit> , but is not expressed in the bovine endometrium although is present in the bovine genome  <cit> .

we have recently generated a considerable amount of data on the transcriptomic signature of the bovine endometrium before and during the initiation of conceptus elongation  <cit> . we hypothesize that genes that are up-regulated at the initiation of conceptus elongation, and that encode for secreted proteins, may contribute to the composition of the ulf and ultimately, drive conceptus elongation. with this in mind, the aims of this study were to: 1) screen endometrial transcriptomic data  for genes that encode secreted proteins on day  <dig> following estrus; 2) determine temporal changes in the expression of these genes during the estrous cycle/early pregnancy; 3) determine if expression of these genes is affected by altered concentrations of p <dig> in vivo that are known to impact conceptus elongation; and 4) determine if the protein products of these genes are detectable in ulf.

methods
all experimental procedures involving animals were licensed by the department of health and children, ireland, in accordance with the cruelty to animals act  and the european community directive 86/609/ec and were sanctioned by the animal research ethics committee of university college dublin. unless otherwise stated, all chemicals and reagents were sourced from sigma .

selection of candidate genes from transcriptomic data sets
to identify candidate genes from our gene expression data sets, two separate approaches were taken . rna sequencing  data from cyclic heifers on day  <dig> of the estrous cycle were screened to identify the most highly expressed transcripts in the endometrium that were not detectable in the conceptus at the corresponding stage of development  <cit>  using a previously described approach  <cit> . briefly, only transcripts detected in four out of five replicates for either the endometrium or conceptus, with an rpkm  value of at least  <dig>  were considered. the resulting list was screened to identify genes expressed only in cells of the endometrium  on day  <dig>  this list was then subjected to david analysis  to identify those genes that encoded for proteins assigned to the gene ontology terms ‘secreted’ or ‘extracellular’. additional candidate genes were selected on the basis of a significant increase in expression on day  <dig> compared to day  <dig> of the estrous cycle  <cit> .

all genes selected for analysis encoded for secreted or extracellular proteins as determined by david analysis .

experiment 1: temporal changes in endometrial expression of candidate genes from cyclic and pregnant heifers during the pre-implantation period of early pregnancy
the estrous cycles of cross-bred beef heifers  were synchronized by insertion of an intravaginal controlled internal drug release  device  for  <dig> days. one day prior to cidr removal each heifer received an intramuscular injection of a prostaglandin f2α  analogue . only those heifers observed in standing estrus  were utilized further and were assigned randomly to either an inseminated group  or an un-inseminated cyclic control group . heifers were slaughtered on either day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  of the estrous cycle or day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  following estrus and insemination. these stages correspond in pregnant heifers to blastocyst formation, blastocyst hatching, initiation of conceptus elongation, maternal recognition of pregnancy and initiation of implantation, respectively. thirty minutes after slaughter the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum  was flushed with  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm tris . ulf was centrifuged at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min, supernatant removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to proteomic analysis. in the inseminated group, only those reproductive tracts from which an embryo/conceptus at the expected stage of development was recovered  were processed further. intercaruncular endometrial tissue was dissected free from the underlying myometrium and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for rna extraction and quantitative real-time pcr  analysis.

experiment 2: p <dig> effects on endometrial gene expression of candidate genes
in order to investigate the effect of circulating p <dig> on the expression of these candidate genes, we examined the endometrium of heifers with low, normal and high p <dig> from previously generated tissue samples. the estrous cycles of cross-bred beef heifers were synchronized as described in experiment  <dig> and those observed in standing estrus  were randomly assigned to one of three treatments:  cyclic heifers normal p <dig>  no treatment ;  cyclic heifers, high p <dig> , receiving an intravaginal p <dig> device on day  <dig> of the estrous cycle to increase concentrations of p <dig> in blood  <cit> ; and  cyclic heifers, low p <dig>  receiving  <dig> intramuscular injections of a pg analogue  on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the estrous cycle to reduce p <dig> output from the cl  <cit> . the progesterone profiles of animals on these treatments have been extensively reported by us in previous papers  <cit> . following slaughter, intercaruncular endometrial tissue from the tip of the uterine horn ipsilateral to the cl was recovered, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent rna extraction and analyzed using qpcr for selected genes.

quantitative real-time pcr analysis 
all qpcr analyses were performed as previously described  <cit> . total rna was extracted from  <dig> mg of intercaruncular endometrial tissue using trizol reagent as per manufacturer’s instructions. both rna clean-up and on-column dnase treatment were performed  and the subsequent rna was analyzed for both quality and quantity using the agilent bioanalyzer  and nanodrop  <dig> , respectively. one microgram of total rna was converted to complementary dna  using superscript iii  and random hexamers as per manufacturer’s instructions. all primers were designed using primer-blast software  to span exon-exon boundaries where possible. each qpcr reaction was carried out in duplicate with  <dig> ng of cdna, optimized primer concentrations  and  <dig>  μl fast sybrgreen mastermix  in a final reaction volume of  <dig> μl. all reactions were carried out using the  <dig> fast real-time pcr system  with the following cycling conditions:  <dig> min at 50°c;  <dig> min at 95°c; and  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec and 60°c for  <dig> min. a dissociation curve was included in each run to ensure specificity of amplification, while a standard curve was included for each gene of interest as well as for the normalizer genes  to determine primer efficiencies. all raw cycle threshold values were then imported into qbaseplus software  used to calibrate and normalize data, as well as calculate expression values for each gene in arbitrary units .

all primers were used at a concentration of  <dig> nm in a final reaction volume of  <dig> μl. a dissociation curve was included to ensure specificity of each primer pair.

proteomic analysis of uterine luminal fluid during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy
nano lc ms/ms analysis was carried out on ulf from pregnant heifers on days  <dig> and  <dig> to identify proteins involved in conceptus elongation . samples  were exchanged into  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, dtt added to a final concentration of  <dig> mm, and samples were incubated at 60°c for  <dig> min followed by cooling to room temperature . iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of  <dig> mm and incubated in the dark for  <dig> min at rt. a tryptic digestion was performed at 37°c overnight. nano lc was carried out using a dionex ultimate  <dig> . tryptic peptides were loaded into an α-precolumn cartridge and separated using an acetonitrile gradient  on the nano lc column. fractions were collected at  <dig> sec intervals followed by mass spectrometry analysis on ab sciex tof/tof™  <dig> system . mass spectra were acquired in reflectron positive ion mode. tof/tof tandem ms fragmentation spectra were acquired for each ion, averaging  <dig> laser shots per fragmentation spectrum . identification of the resulting peptide mass and the associated fragmentation spectra were submitted to gps explorer workstation equipped with mascot search engine  to search the non-redundant database of national center for biotechnology information . searches were performed without constraining protein molecular weight or isoelectric point, with variable carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine residues, and with one missed cleavage also being allowed in the search parameters.

itraq analysis was carried out on ulf recovered from pregnant heifers on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  to identify quantitative changes in the protein content . two ml of each individual sample was precipitated in  <dig> ml of 100% etoh overnight, the resulting pellet was washed twice and resuspended in  <dig> μl of lysis buffer and centrifuged at  <dig>  g. the supernatant was incubated for  <dig> min at rt with  <dig> mm iodoacetamide in the dark and the resulting protein concentration was determined by bradford assay. one hundred micorgrammes of total protein was subjected to trypsin digestion  at 37°c overnight with additional trypsin added and the reaction continued for a further  <dig> h. the resulting peptides were acidified with formic acid , desalted with macro spin tips containing vydac c <dig> material  and lyophilized. the lyophilized samples were dissolved in  <dig> μl of itraq buffer  and  <dig> μl of each sample were reacted with appropriate itraq reagent for  <dig> h at rt as per the manufacturer’s protocol. the reaction was stopped with  <dig> μl of 20% formic acid, ph  <dig>  and dried by lyophilisation. strong cation exchange  was performed on a polysulfoethyl a column  using an agilent  <dig> hplc system  with  <dig> fractions collected per sample. protein identification and quantification of itraq reporter ions was performed using nanolc‒esims/ms which consisted of an agilent  <dig> nanolc system , picotip emitter  and a qexactive quadrupole‒orbitrap mass spectrometer . the dried scx peptide fractions were resuspended in  <dig> μl of milliq water containing  <dig> % formic acid and 1% acetonitrile. after trapping  <dig> μl of each sample the peptides were desalted for  <dig> min on an enrichment column  using a solution of 1% acetonitrile and  <dig> % formic acid solution. all peptides were separated on a zorbax  <dig> sb c <dig>   <dig> μm ×  <dig> mm column  for  <dig> min, using an acetonitrile gradient containing 5-25% acetonitrile in  <dig> % formic acid. the mass spectrometer was operated in a data‒dependent mode by subjecting the ten most abundant ions of each survey spectrum  to hcd fragmentation . msms peak lists were extracted to mascot generic format files and searched by the mascot search algorithm against the bovine ipi database that has been curated from duplicate entries. the mass tolerance was set to  <dig> ppm for peptide masses and  <dig>  da for fragment ions. quantitative information was obtained with the protein ratio type set to “weighted” and normalization to “summed intensities”.

data analysis
all data were analysed using the statistical package sas . for gene expression analysis, the log of the cnrq values in arbitrary units was used and analysis was performed using the general linear model procedure  with day, pregnancy status and/or p <dig> status, when appropriate, as the main effects. treatment effects on gene expression were separated by tukey’s test and a p value of ≤  <dig>  was considered significant.

RESULTS
identification of candidate genes from large-scale transcriptomic data sets
from the rna-seq data, a total of  <dig> distinct transcripts with an extracellular localization were uniquely detected in the endometrium . three genes had rpkm values of greater than  <dig>  in the endometrium  and were chosen for further analysis. fourteen genes had expression values in the endometrium of between  <dig> and  <dig>  rpkm . of the remaining genes,  <dig> had expression levels between  <dig> and  <dig> rpkm, while  <dig> genes had expression of <  <dig> rpkm in the endometrium of cyclic heifers on day  <dig> . none of these genes were expressed in the conceptus at levels detectable by rna-seq . screening of microarray data indicated increased expression on day  <dig> of an additional  <dig> candidate genes that encode for secreted or extracellular proteins including apolipoprotein a- <dig> , arylsulfatase a , cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer,  <dig> , lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase , mucin  <dig>  cell surface associated , neuromedin n , neurochondrin , nephronectin , neurexophilin  <dig>  and tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen like- <dig> . these were selected as they have not been previously interrogated in the context of conceptus elongation in cattle.

changes in endometrial gene expression throughout the estrous cycle and early pregnancy
the endometrial expression of arsa, muc <dig>  nxph <dig> and penk increased  as the estrous cycle/early pregnancy progressed ; however, pregnancy status had no significant effect on their expression. no effects of day, pregnancy or their interactions were detected for cyr <dig> or mgp . the expression of apoa <dig>  dcn, lcat, ncdn, nmn, npnt, plin <dig> and tinagl <dig> was modulated  as the estrous cycle/early pregnancy progressed . in addition, apoa <dig>  dcn and npnt expression was higher in the endometrium of cyclic compared to pregnant heifers, while pregnancy increased  the expression of lcat, ncdn, nmn, plin <dig> and tinagl <dig> in the endometrium.

protein encoded for by these genes were detected in uterine luminal fluid during the period of conceptus elongation  through to initiation of implantation  by either nano lc ms/ms or itraq analyses. significance is set at p< <dig>  , p< <dig>   or p< <dig>  . – denotes no significant effect of a given treatment. nd = protein product not detected by either method.

regulation of candidate gene expression in the endometrium by altered progesterone concentrations in vivo
high and low concentrations of circulating p <dig> were associated with four main patterns of gene expression in the endometrium. the expression of apoa <dig>  penk and tinagl <dig> was similar among treatment groups on day 7; however, the magnitude of the normal increase in expression of these genes on day  <dig> was reduced  in heifers with low p <dig> . in contrast, low p <dig> decreased  the expression of lcat and npnt on day  <dig> only , while an early increase  in the expression of nxph <dig> and plin <dig> was observed in heifers with high p <dig> . nmn expression was higher  in low p <dig> heifers on day  <dig> compared to high and normal p <dig> groups , while the expression of arsa, dcn, muc <dig> and ncdn was not affected by altered concentrations of circulating p <dig> .

protein abundance in the ulf during the peri-implantation period of early pregnancy
to further test the hypothesis that these molecules play a role in conceptus elongation, the presence of the protein products of these genes in ulf during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy was examined. of the  <dig> candidate genes which encode for putatively secreted proteins and whose expression was modulated in the endometrium during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy,  <dig> were detected by either itraq or nano lc ms/ms analysis of ulf collected on either days  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> of pregnancy. using itraq, lcat was detected in ulf of pregnant heifers on day  <dig> of pregnancy, while ncdn and plin <dig> were detected on days  <dig> and  <dig>  quantitative changes in their abundance were not detected, however. plin <dig> was detected on days  <dig> and  <dig> of pregnancy by nano lc ms/ms. in contrast apoa <dig> and arsa proteins were detected in ulf using both itraq and nano lc ms/ms on all days of pregnancy examined. the abundance of apoa <dig> and arsa declined  from day  <dig> to day  <dig> .

discussion
in cattle, as in other ruminants, the transition from a blastocyst to a fully elongated conceptus is one of the major morphological events that take place during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. this process is a maternally-driven event, as elongation does not occur in vivo in the absence of uterine gland secretions in sheep  <cit> , and has yet to be recapitulated in vitro in cattle  <cit> . transfer of in vitro derived blastocysts  <cit>  or trophoblastic vesicles  <cit>  into the uterus of synchronized recipients results in successful conceptus elongation; ulf must therefore contain molecules that drive conceptus elongation. one approach to predicting which proteins are present in ulf is to examine the endometrial expression of selected genes that encode for proteins that are known to be secreted or extracellular in nature. if expression of these genes is modulated during early pregnancy and/or by altered concentrations of p <dig> in vivo , it is plausible that they are candidate genes likely to influence conceptus elongation. using this candidate gene approach, we found that expression of arsa, muc <dig>  nxph <dig> and penk increased with advancing stages of the estrous cycle and early pregnancy. similarly, lcat, ncdn, nmn, plin <dig> and tinagl <dig> expression increased during the later luteal phase, with the presence of the conceptus significantly increasing their expression. in contrast, apoa <dig>  dcn and npnt expression decreased in pregnant compared with cyclic heifers. a delay in the postovulatory increase in circulating concentrations of p <dig> delayed the increase in expression of lcat and npnt on day  <dig> and apoa <dig>  penk and tinagl <dig> on day  <dig>  the day on which conceptus elongation is initiated. finally, comparison of this list of candidate genes with the protein content of ulf of pregnant heifers during conceptus elongation  indicated the presence of apoa <dig>  arsa, lcat, ncdn as well as members of the plin family, lending validity to this candidate gene expression approach.

in cattle, two of the main molecules that affect endometrial gene expression are circulating concentrations of p <dig> and conceptus-derived ifnt, both of which can affect the composition of the ulf and alter the rate of conceptus elongation. the comparison of gene expression in the endometrium and proteins present in ulf identified four proteins  from  <dig> candidate genes, while two members of the perilipin family were detected. at first glance, the number of proteins detected in ulf in comparison to the number of candidate genes may seem low. however, it is important to note that there is at least an order of magnitude in the difference between the number of total transcripts detectable in the endometrium by rna-seq  versus the number of total proteins detected in ulf by proteomics  <cit> . in addition, analysis of gene expression was performed on endometrial homogenates which contain a heterogenous cell population. it is possible that, despite their status as genes that encode for extracellular/secreted proteins, their expression may be predominantly stromal in nature, similar to the expression of hgf <cit>  and fgf <dig> <cit>  in the sheep endometrium. as such, the protein products of these genes may not be secreted into ulf, but may act in a more autocrine or paracrine manner within the endometrium.

the patterns of expression of arsa, muc <dig>  nxph <dig> and penk were similar in endometria from both pregnant and cyclic heifers. muc <dig> exhibited minimal expression on day  <dig> and  <dig>  while arsa, nxph <dig> and penk expression decreased on day  <dig>  but increased significantly during the late luteal phase of the estrous cycle and as pregnancy progressed. given that the expression of these genes increased during the luteal phase of the estrous cycle and early pregnancy, we propose that they play a role in establishing uterine receptivity to implantation. although the protein products of nxph <dig> or penk were not detected in ulf, the increased mrna abundance for these genes in endometria of p4-supplemented heifers strongly suggests that they contribute to advancing conceptus elongation after both artificial insemination  <cit>  and embryo transfer  <cit> .

in contrast, endometrial expression of apoa <dig>  dcn and npnt decreased in to the presence of the developing conceptus. expression of both apoa <dig> and npnt was modulated by p <dig>  with a delay on day  <dig> in apoa <dig> expression, while p <dig> supplementation resulted in an early increase in npnt on day  <dig>  we propose that the decreased expression of these genes in endometria in the peri-implantation period of pregnancy, may be a pre-requisite for establishing uterine receptivity to implantation, similar to that observed for nuclear p <dig> receptors in all species studied  <cit>  as well as muc <dig> in sheep  <cit> .

the modulation of circulating concentrations of p <dig> in cattle and sheep has demonstrable effects on gene expression in the endometrium and timing of conceptus elongation. in cattle, this results in altered trajectories of conceptus elongation on day  <dig> following embryo transfer on day  <dig>  exogenous supplementation of p <dig> advances conceptus elongation  <cit> ; conversely, when p <dig> output from the cl is diminished  <cit> , conceptus elongation is delayed. high circulating concentrations of p <dig> advanced the normal increase of nxph <dig> expression on day  <dig> of the estrous cycle, while in heifers with low p <dig> the normal expression level of npnt was decreased. in addition, decreased expression of apoa <dig> and penk on day  <dig> in heifers with low p <dig> and delayed conceptus elongation suggests that these endometrial genes and their protein products contribute to the process of conceptus elongation. this hypothesis is supported by evidence for the presence of apoa <dig> protein in ulf on both day  <dig> and  <dig> 

of the  <dig> candidate genes examined, changes in expression of nmn, plin <dig> and tinagl <dig> were of particular interest. neurotensin  was first isolated from the bovine hypothalamus  <cit>  and small intestine  <cit>  and nmn protein, along with nt is derived from the same precursor peptide with the resulting active form of the peptides  being dependent of the site of cleavage of the pro-peptide . interestingly, the predominant forms of the processed peptides are tissue-specific, e.g., the long form of nmn is the predominant form in the gut  <cit> . nmn expression was similar in pregnant and cyclic heifers up to day  <dig> when pregnancy recognition occurs and was modulated by low circulating concentrations of p <dig>  nmn protein was not detected in ulf, but a protein that degrades nmn, aminopeptidase m  <cit> , has been detected in ulf  <cit> . this may explain in part why nmn protein was not detected and, given its expression pattern, may suggest that nmn is involved in the pregnancy recognition response in the endometrium rather than conceptus elongation itself.

tinagl <dig> is a matri-cellular protein that can interact with both extracellular matrix proteins and cell surface receptors. in mice, tinagl <dig> is expressed by the trophectoderm and interacts with laminin  <dig>  <cit> . tinagl <dig> expression increases in the endometrium of pregnant mice as well as at the sites of implantation where the abundance of protein increases during the later stages of implantation  <cit> . in addition, tinagl <dig> has been linked to the integrins itga <dig> and itgb <dig> in the decidua  <cit> . in the current study, tinagl <dig> expression was minimal from day  <dig> to  <dig>  but increased on day  <dig> and to a greater extent in pregnant than cyclic heifers. this is interesting as there is basal expression when the uterus is not receptive to implantation . tinagl <dig> expression increases after uterine receptivity to implantation is established, but interestingly, its expression on day  <dig>  when conceptus elongation is initiated, is minimal. moreover, tinagl <dig> protein is not detectable in ulf. thus, tinalg <dig> in the endometrium of cattle is not directly involved in conceptus elongation, but instead plays a role in implantation as evidenced by its increase in expression in pregnant heifers on days  <dig> and  <dig>  similar to its role in mice.

plin <dig>  protein is involved in lipid droplet formation and, in particular, the intracellular storage of triaclyglycerols . it is also detectable in milk lipid droplets secreted from mammary epithelial cells in a variety of species including humans, rats and cattle  <cit> . triaclyglycerols have been detected in the ulf of cattle  <cit>  and in vitro tag is utilized as an energy source by the embryo up to the blastocyst stage of development  <cit> . in both breast cancer and leiomyoma human cell lines, the plin <dig> gene has a pgr response element in its promoter region. given its modulation by p <dig> in vivo and its increased expression in pregnant heifers likely due to ifnt  <cit> , as well as detection of plin <dig> family members in ulf of cattle, it is likely that plin <dig> contributes to the secretion and /or transport of tag into the ulf as an energy source for the developing conceptus during elongation.

CONCLUSIONS
using a candidate gene approach, we determined that the expression of penk is affected by altered concentrations of p <dig> in blood while pregnancy increases and decreases the expression of ncdn and dcn, respectively. in addition, we determined that both p <dig> manipulation and the presence of the conceptus alter endometrial expression of plin <dig>  tinagl <dig>  npnt, lcat, nmn and apoa <dig>  comparison of the expression profiles of these genes to proteins detected in ulf during conceptus elongation  revealed the presence of apoa <dig>  arsa, lcat, ncdn as well as members of the plin family of proteins that may play roles in driving conceptus elongation in cattle.
