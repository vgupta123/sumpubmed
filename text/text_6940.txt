BACKGROUND
peptide-hla  class i complexes displayed on the cell surface play an important role in the t-cell mediated immune response  <cit> . the approximately 9-residue long peptides originate from proteins that are digested by the proteasome inside the cell  <cit> . depending on whether the t-cell receptor recognizes a peptide as self or non-self, an immune response may be initiated  <cit> . peptide-hla complexes displayed specifically on the surface of cancer cells provide an excellent opportunity to develop targeted cancer therapeutics  <cit> . such therapeutics could include engineered t-cells or “tcr-like” antibodies  <cit> . to inhibit the unwanted proliferation of cancer cells, the engineered t-cells are designed to express a receptor that can bind to peptide-hla complexes on the surface of the cancer cells, thereby effecting cytotoxicity . “tcr-like” antibodies may also be designed to link peptide-hla complexes on cancer cells to cytotoxic t-cells . although these therapeutic technologies are under constant development, several studies have shown that they are very effective in killing cells . extreme caution is, therefore, required to develop these therapeutic molecules so that they specifically kill only cancer cells and not cells from essential, normal tissues .

for precisely killing the cancer cells using the engineered t-cells or antibodies, it is important to target peptide-hla complexes that are present “only” on the surface of cancer cells  <cit> . the presence of the target complexes on the surface of cells in essential, normal tissues could easily result in adverse events . if the target peptides, i.e., peptides in the target complexes, are derived from genes that have low or no expression in the essential, normal tissues, then the obvious implication is that the adverse events due to toxic cross-reactivity can be avoided. however, recent research has demonstrated that avoiding the toxic cross-reactivity involving peptide-hla targets is not that straightforward, and therefore, extremely challenging  <cit> .

several clinical trials involving engineered t-cells targeted against peptide-hla complexes recently have reported fatal adverse events. in one clinical trial  <cit> ,  <dig> cancer patients received engineered t-cells targeting a peptide-hla complex involving peptide kvaelvhfl from magea <dig> and hla-a*02: <dig>  melanoma antigen a <dig> or magea <dig> is a cancer testis antigen, expressed in tumor tissue and not significantly expressed in essential, normal tissues. therefore, targeting of peptides from magea <dig> and many other genes in the mage family was considered unlikely to result in off-target toxicity. however, beginning 1- <dig> days post infusion,  <dig> patients experienced mental status changes, and  <dig> out of  <dig> patients lapsed into coma and subsequently died. it was later discovered that the fatal toxicity most likely occurred due to off-target effects involving magea <dig>  peptide kmaelvhfl, which also binds to hla-a*02: <dig>  in another clinical trial  <cit> , two melanoma patients, who received engineered t-cells designed to bind to a magea <dig> peptide  in complex with hla-a01: <dig> suffered fatal cardiac toxicity. subsequent to the fatal adverse events, it was discovered that a peptide-hla complex  similar to the target complex was the most likely culprit of off-target toxicity. the peptide is contained in a gene called titin  that is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle.

the outcome from these two clinical trials suggests that extreme caution is required when targeting peptide-hla complexes. as suggested by the investigations performed after the clinical trials described above, a peptide that has between  <dig> and  <dig> identical amino acids can potentially cause off-target effects. therefore, there are two critical factors when considering targeting of hla-peptide complexes. first, expression of the peptide in the target complex should be cancer-specific. second, peptides that may form a cross-reacting complex  should not be present in essential, normal tissues. attempts to predict cross-reacting “off-targets” generally include a blast search of the human peptidome to find sequences similar to the target peptide, followed by selection of the most similar peptides predicted to bind the hla allele of interest that are ubiquitously expressed  <cit> . the recently published expitope webserver is designed to perform these steps in a systematic fashion  <cit> . the webserver combines blast searches , and various prediction tools that predict whether the similar peptides will form complexes with the hla allele of interest. the webserver also returns expression levels of the peptide in cancer cell lines and normal tissues from illumina human body map .

in contrast to the scope of the expitope webserver, our work focuses on the identification of cancer-specific peptide-hla targets using gene expression data from cancer tissues and essential, normal tissues. here we describe a novel computational strategy that analyzes the canonical human peptidome, identifies potential peptide-hla cancer targets, and then prioritizes them based on the likelihood of cross-reactivity that could be associated with them. first, all possible 9-mer peptides in the canonical human proteome that can bind the hla-a*02: <dig> allele are identified. the current focus on hla-a*02: <dig> allele is due to its high allelic frequency  <cit> , the high accuracy of binding prediction method for complexes involving hla-a*02: <dig> , and availability of crystal structures of complexes between peptide-hlas and t-cell receptors/tcr-like antibodies. based on the gene expression data from the tcga  cancer samples and adjacent normal tissue samples, and the normal tissue samples from gtex   <cit> , cancer-specific peptide-hla complexes are identified. for each target complex, similar complexes are identified using a combination of sequence similarity and molecular modeling approaches in contrast to just using a sequence similarity based approach as in the case of expitope webserver  <cit> . the similar complexes that are expressed in essential, normal tissue samples from the tcga and gtex databases are considered potential off-targets. target complexes are then prioritized based on the number of predicted off-targets associated with them; a target with lower number of off-targets associated with it is assigned higher priority. due to the computational nature of our work, instead of discarding targets based on cross-reactivity predictions, we use predictions to only prioritize targets for future cell-based validation assays.

in the following section, we describe in detail our strategy for identifying cancer-specific peptide-hla targets, derived from the canonical human proteome, across various cancer types. this description is followed by results obtained from a comprehensive exploration of the human proteome as well as some specific examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach towards discovering peptide-hla targets. we conclude with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of our strategy in its current form, and possible directions for further improvement.

methods
we have developed a computational strategy to identify potential cancer-specific peptide-hla targets and prioritize these targets based on the likelihood of potential cross-reactivity. our strategy involves four steps: 1) 9-mers are identified from each protein sequence in the human proteome. 2) binding affinities of the peptides in complex with the hla-a*02: <dig>  are computed and based on the predicted affinity values, potential peptide-hla complexes are selected. 3) cancer-specific peptide-hla complexes are identified based on the expression of the peptide in cancer versus essential, normal tissue samples. 4) for each of the peptides in the potential cancer-specific complexes, similar peptides in the human proteome are identified and their degree of similarity  is calculated. the complexes are then prioritized based on the number of similar complexes at different dos threshold levels. in the subsections below, we describe the individual components of our strategy in more detail.

step 1: extract human proteome
all human proteins and their canonical amino acid sequences are extracted from the reviewed subset of the uniprotkb database  <cit>  . the reviewed subset contains several proteins that correspond to multiple alleles of hla genes hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, and hla-drb <dig>  the proteins that correspond to alleles with highest allelic frequencies are kept as representative of the human proteome and the rest are removed. the genes with highest allelic frequency in european caucasian us population are hla-a* <dig> , hla-b* <dig> , hla-c* <dig> , and hla-drb1* <dig>   <cit> . the reviewed subset also contains entries that correspond to long-intergenic-noncoding rna  genes  <cit> ; such entries are ignored because lincrnas are not known to get translated to proteins. in total  <dig>  proteins are thus extracted. since we are interested in identifying peptide-hla complexes, we extract potential peptides from the set of  <dig>  proteins. hla class i molecules are known to bind peptides that are usually  <dig> to  <dig> residue long, although peptides that are longer have also been identified. among the  <dig>  linear epitopes involving hla-a*02: <dig> available in the iedb database  <cit>  ,  <dig>  contain peptides that are 9-residue long. in this work, therefore, we only consider peptides that are 9-mers. all overlapping 9-mers are extracted from the protein sequences corresponding to the  <dig>  proteins. after removing the 9-mers that contain non-standard amino acids, a set of  <dig> , <dig> peptides remains.

step 2: potential peptide-hla complexes
potential peptide-hla complexes are identified using a webserver called netmhcstab   <cit> . netmhcstab webserver employs a neural network based machine learning model to predict the binding affinity of a peptide and hla allele. the predicted binding affinity  estimates how tightly the peptide and the hla molecule bind to each other. a peptide is considered a strong binder to a hla allele if the ic <dig> value is smaller than  <dig> nanomolars ; it is considered a weak binder if the ic <dig> value is smaller than  <dig> nm. in this work, a peptide and hla allele is considered a putative complex if the peptide is predicted to bind with an affinity less than  <dig> nm. the set of  <dig> , <dig> peptides is evaluated for binding affinity with the hla-a*02: <dig> allele using the netmhcstab webserver which results in the identification of  <dig>   potential peptide-hla complexes.

step 3: cancer-specific complexes
the precise targeting of cancer cells requires that potential peptide-hla targets are specific to cancer cells  <cit> . thus, to evaluate whether or not a peptide-hla complex can be used for the precise targeting of cancer cells, gene expression data from cancer tissue mrna samples and essential, normal tissue mrna samples is compared. in this work any normal tissue that can be sacrificed in the process of treating cancer is classified as non-essential, e.g., tissues from male and female reproductive organs . the gene expression data for the cancer tissue samples is derived from tcga  repository. the gene expression data for the essential, normal tissues is derived from tcga as well as gtex  repository  <cit> . note that in this work we use normal tissue data from two different sources so that we can ascertain with high confidence the expression levels of a gene in the normal tissues.

raw data produced from the rna-seq analysis  <cit>  of mrna samples done by tcga and gtex is available from the respective data repositories. the data used in this work corresponds to  <dig>  tcga cancer samples ,  <dig> tcga adjacent normal samples , and  <dig>  gtex normal samples . the distribution of the samples is tabulated in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  although the raw data has been processed by tcga and gtex to produce gene expression values, we decided to use a common data processing pipeline to exclude any potential discrepancy due to different processing pipelines used by tcga and gtex. the data processing pipeline, implemented by omicsoft  <cit> , has processed the raw rna-seq data to produce the gene expression values in each sample, which are measured in reads per kilobase per million   <cit> .using these expression values, the 75-percentile rpkm value of each gene in each cancer type as well as the 75-percentile rpkm value of each gene in each essential, normal tissue type is derived. it has been estimated that depending on the total amount of rna in the cell, a single copy of a transcript is equivalent to somewhere between  <dig>  and  <dig>  rpkm  <cit> . a peptide-hla complex is, therefore, classified as specific to a cancer type if the 75-percentile rpkm value of the gene  in cancer samples is greater than  <dig> , and the maximum of the 75-percentile rpkm across all normal tissue types is less than  <dig> . the usage of the above rpkm thresholds implies that, given the  <dig>  % allelic frequency of hla-a*02: <dig>  <cit> , in  <dig> % or more cancer patients of a specific type, at least one copy of the target is present in the cancer cells and zero copies in the essential, normal cells. thus, based on the gene expression values, we restrict discovery of targets to those genes that are highly expressed in cancer cells and weakly expressed in essential, normal tissue cells. out of the  <dig>  potential peptide-hla complexes, a list of  <dig> potential cancer-specific complexes is thus obtained.

step 4: off-target complexes
although we have carefully identified cancer-specific complexes so far, a therapeutic agent targeted at a peptide-hla complex can have potential off-target effects if similar peptide-hla complexes are present on the surface of cells from the essential, normal tissues  <cit> . we have described in the introduction section a case study where the off-target toxicity was caused due to the presence of a similar complex in which the amino acids of the peptides were identical at only  <dig> positions   <cit> . to our knowledge, toxic cross-reactivity due to peptides with more mismatches has not been reported yet. therefore, we assume in this work, that two peptide-hla complexes can be considered similar if the hla alleles are the same and the peptides have  <dig> or more identical residues at the same positions.

for each of the  <dig> peptide-hla complexes, a list of similar peptides in the human proteome  along with the degree of similarity  between each pair of similar peptides is derived. the dos between two peptides is defined as the number of identical amino acids in peptides at identical positions, which is same as the hamming distance between the sequence strings of the two peptides  <cit> . since the focus of this work is on 9-mer peptides, a maximum dos value of  <dig> implies that two peptides are identical. the lower the dos, the lower the degree of similarity and two peptides are considered dissimilar if dos is less than  <dig> 

not all of the similar complexes are however a cause for concern with regard to potential toxicity. if the 95-percentile expression of the similar peptide is greater than  <dig>  in any essential, normal tissue type, then we consider that the similar complex will likely result in toxic off-target effects. we have utilized very conservative criteria for determining toxicity so that the risk of not being able to predict potential off-target toxicity is minimal. the target peptide-hla complexes are prioritized on the basis of the number of associated similar complexes that can potentially result in toxic off-target effects. the higher the number of such similar complexes, the more likely is a toxic off-target effect.

one potential limitation of our approach is that the number of similar complexes is overestimated, because the amino acid positions in the peptides are not discriminated with respect to their importance for binding a particular therapeutic tcr or tcr-like antibody. amino acid positions in a peptide that are involved in hydrophobic contacts and/or hydrogen bonds with the tcr/antibody are considered important for binding the therapeutic molecule, and the rest are considered non-important  <cit> . since this work focuses on peptide-hla complexes involving hla-a*02: <dig>  we took advantage of the structures of complexes of peptide-hla and tcr/antibody in the protein data bank   <cit>  to determine the importance of each amino acid position in the peptide, and then incorporated this into our strategy.

there are  <dig> available crystal structures that involve a 9-mer peptide  with hla-a*02: <dig> in complex with a tcr/antibody . for any other hla allele, very few such structures are available. in each of the  <dig> crystal structures, the important and non-important peptide positions are identified, thus producing a contact pattern corresponding to the  <dig> positions in the peptide. the hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bond interactions are identified using software called chimera  <cit> . a peptide position is considered to be in hydrophobic contact when the van der waals distance between any side chain atoms at that position with any atom in the tcr/antibody is between  <dig> Å and  <dig> Å. similarly a hydrogen bond is considered to exist between a hydrogen atom connected to an electronegative atom  and another electronegative atom  when the distance between the donor and the acceptor is less than 4Å and the angle donor-hydrogen-acceptor is less than 30°. out of the  <dig> contact patterns thus identified, only  <dig> are unique . using these  <dig> patterns, a simple predictor can classify a position of a query peptide as non-important if fewer than a threshold number of patterns show the position as important. clearly, the simple predictor is agnostic of the query peptide sequence.

we have developed an improved predictor based on molecular modeling. given a query peptide, structures of peptide-hla-a*02: <dig> complexes are modeled by mutating the amino acids of peptides in the  <dig> pdb structures to match the query peptide’s amino acid sequence. after mutations are applied, structures are energy minimized to eliminate steric clashes and the structure with any remaining clashes are discarded. both mutations and energy minimization are done using chimera in its default settings  <cit> . contact patterns are then computed for modeled structures of peptide-hla-tcr/antibody complexes involving the query peptide and unique patterns are identified. similar to the simple predictor, a peptide position is classified as non-important if fewer than a threshold number of patterns from the modeled structures show the position as important.

we performed a leave-one-out validation experiment  <cit>  to ascertain the receiver operator characteristics  of the simple predictor and the modeling-based predictor. each predictor was used to identify non-important peptide positions for known peptide-hla-tcr/antibody complex based on the remaining known complexes. at different threshold values, the number of true positives , true negatives , false positives , and false negatives  were calculated, upon which the true positive rate and false positive rate were calculated. the roc curves obtained for the simple and modeling-based predictors are shown in fig.  <dig>  the area under curve  for the simple predictor is  <dig>  and for the modeling-based predictor is  <dig> . more importantly, at threshold value equal to  <dig>  the true positive rate is  <dig>  and the false positive rate is  <dig> for the modeling-based predictor.
fig.  <dig> receiver-operator characteristics of predictors that identify peptide positions which are not important for binding interactions with a therapeutic molecule. a simple pdb-based predictor and a molecular modeling based predictor were compared



clearly, we cannot identify all non-important positions in a peptide, but the ones we identify are the correct ones, at least based on the limited structure data we have so far in pdb. we may still overestimate the importance of certain peptide positions but it allows us to err on the side of caution when predicting similar complexes that can result in potentially toxic off-target effects. in general at least  <dig> peptide positions are considered to play a role in tcr binding  <cit> , therefore similar complexes with similarity at fewer than  <dig> important positions are discarded. the peptide-hla complexes are thus re-prioritized on the basis of the number of remaining similar complexes.

prioritized targets
the  <dig> potential targets were prioritized based on the likelihood of off-target toxicity. the targets were first prioritized by the increasing number of associated off-targets at dos greater than or equal to  <dig>  further prioritization was similarly done based on similar complexes at dos greater than or equal to  <dig>  if multiple targets had same number of similar complexes, a target with higher expression in tumor was prioritized higher. as described in the methods section, we used a molecular modeling based predictor to discriminate important and non-important peptide positions. the prioritized  <dig> targets are listed in additional file  <dig>  the number of predicted off-targets associated with each of the  <dig> targets are shown in fig.  <dig>  each panel in the figure shows the number of off-targets based on different combinations of usage of molecular modeling based predictor and dos threshold levels. the figures show that after using the modeling-based predictor, there are fewer off-targets associated with the  <dig> targets at both dos ≥  <dig> and dos ≥  <dig> threshold levels. fewer than  <dig> off-targets are associated with  <dig> and  <dig> targets at dos ≥  <dig> and dos ≥  <dig> respectively . out of the  <dig> and  <dig> targets,  <dig> and  <dig> targets respectively have fewer than  <dig> off-targets associated with them. thus, even though there are a few targets with a large number  of off-targets associated with them, there are a significant number of targets with reasonable number of associated off-targets that could be experimentally evaluated for cross-reactivity in a tractable manner. it is worth noting that at dos ≥  <dig>  there is only  <dig> target without any associated potential off-target, thus demonstrating the challenge involved in minimizing potential toxic cross-reactivity that could be associated with peptide-hla targets.

top targets for  <dig> different cancer types
the top targets were identified for diffuse large b-cell lymphoma , acute myeloid leukemia , and skin cutaneous melanoma  cancer. these targets are peptides hlspidcev , ltsmwspav , and slsvmssnv  respectively. following are the three genes from which the peptides were derived: nlrp <dig> , umodl <dig> , and magec <dig> . expression of the peptides  in each gtex normal sample, tcga normal sample, and tumor samples  is shown in fig.  <dig>  as illustrated, expression of the peptides in normal samples is very low compared to the expression in the tumor samples. through structural modeling based analysis of contact patterns, positions { <dig> ,7}, { <dig> ,5}, and { <dig> ,8} were classified as important for the peptides hlspidcev, ltsmwspav, and slsvmssvnv respectively.

magea <dig> peptide kvaelvhfl
fatal adverse events were reported in the clinical trial involving engineered t-cell based therapy against the magea <dig> peptide kvaelvhfl-hla-a*02: <dig> complex  <cit> . subsequently,  <dig> different peptides very similar to the target peptide were experimentally evaluated as potential off-targets and peptide kmaelvhfl from the gene magea <dig> was implicated as the most likely off-target. using our strategy, we identified  <dig>  out of the  <dig> peptides as potential off-targets that are listed in table  <dig>  peptide kvvslvhfl from mageb <dig> was not identified because expression of mageb <dig> in essential, normal tissues is too low for the peptide to be recognized as an off-target by our strategy. the other two peptides that were not identified are giaelvhfs  and tvaelvqfv . these two peptides are not contained in the canonical human proteome sequences derived from uniprotkb and were therefore not identified. although we identified kvaelvhfl as a potential skcm target, it was found to be associated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> potential off-targets at dos ≥  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. therefore, it was ranked 516th out of the  <dig> potential targets making it a very low-priority target.
the table lists the off-target peptides, degree of similarity of the off-target peptides with the target peptide, binding affinity  of peptide-hla-a*02: <dig> complexes involving the off-target peptides, genes from which the off-target peptides were derived, and the essential, normal tissue types from gtex and tcga with high expression of the off-target peptides/genes



ctag1a/ny-eso- <dig> peptide sllmwitqc
the cancer testis antigen  <dig> a  peptide sllmwitqc in complex with hla-a*02: <dig> is an active target for engineered t-cell based therapy in multiple myeloma, synovial sarcoma, and advanced melanoma  <cit> . in phase i/ii clinical trials, the safety of the therapy targeting the ctag1a peptide has been demonstrated  <cit> . this target was not in our list of  <dig> targets because the 75-percentile expression of ctag1a/ctag1b in the cancer samples from each tcga cancer type is less than  <dig> rpkm . as described earlier, our aim with using the 75-percentile expression values was to identify targets that could be present in at least  <dig> % of the tcga cancer patients of a specific type. but even if our comprehensive analysis of the human proteome might miss targets that can exist in a smaller subset of cancer patients, our strategy could still be used to predict the likelihood of cross-reactivity associated with any peptide-hla target. fortunately, multiple structures of this particular target in complex with tcr are available in the protein data bank. these structures inform that peptide positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are important for tcr binding. incorporating this information into our strategy, we identified  <dig> off-targets at dos ≥  <dig> and  <dig> off-target at dos ≥  <dig> that are listed in table  <dig>  if peptide sllmwitqc were a part of our target list, it would have been ranked  <dig> st from the top. the high ranking of the target due to fewer predicted off-targets thus demonstrates the ability of our strategy to correctly prioritize a target that has not been associated with any toxic off-target effects in clinical trials to date.
the table lists the off-target peptides, degree of similarity of the off-target peptides with the target peptide, binding affinity  of peptide-hla-a*02: <dig> complexes involving the off-target peptides, genes from which the off-target peptides were derived, and the essential, normal tissue types from gtex and tcga with high expression of the off-target peptides/genes



discussion
in this paper, we have described a novel computational strategy to identify potential cancer-specific peptide-hla complexes that can be targeted by therapeutics such as engineered t-cells and “tcr-like” antibodies . the strength of our strategy lies in not only identifying peptide-hla targets but also in estimating the potential toxic cross-reactivity that could result from therapeutic action against such targets. after a comprehensive analysis of the canonical human proteome, we identified  <dig> peptide-hla-a*02: <dig> targets that are specific to  <dig> different tcga cancer types. only those peptides that are highly expressed in cancer samples, and have extremely low expression in essential, normal tissue samples were considered potential targets. peptides similar to the target peptide were identified from the human proteome based on the similarity of residues. we introduced a molecular modeling-based predictor that classifies peptide positions as important or non-important for interacting with potential therapeutic molecules, and used the predictor to better estimate peptide similarity. the targets were prioritized based on the number of peptides in the human proteome that are similar to the target peptides and are also expressed in essential, normal tissue samples.

at different levels of peptide similarity, measured as the degree of similarity  value, each target peptide is associated with a different number of potential off-targets . the higher the dos value, the fewer is the number of similar peptides. the list of top- <dig> prioritized target peptides  shows that although at dos ≥  <dig> threshold level, there is no associated off-target, at dos ≥  <dig> there are more than  <dig> off-targets except in the case of the topmost target. we earlier discussed an off-target peptide esdpivaqy from titin  that was implicated in fatal cardiac toxicity  <cit> . the dos of the target and the off-target peptide is  <dig>  which informs us that a peptide that is similar at  <dig> identical amino acid positions cannot be disregarded as a potential off-target. therefore, our finding that almost all the potential targets could have off-targets at dos ≥  <dig> emphasizes the challenge involved in developing therapeutics targeting peptide-hla complexes.

given the challenges involved, our comprehensive analysis of the canonical human proteome for identifying novel cancer-specific peptide-hla targets prioritized by likelihood of toxic cross-reactivity, could prove to be an important step in the development of therapeutic molecules with low cross-reactivity. we have demonstrated the ability to predict the potential toxic cross-reactivity that was observed in the clinical trial involving administration of engineered t-cells targeting magea <dig> peptide kvaelvhfl in complex with hla-a*02: <dig>  <cit> . based on our analysis, this magea <dig> peptide may not have been investigated in a clinical trial.

the current work is focused on targets that involve peptides in complex with hla-a*02: <dig>  this gives us two benefits: 1) the binding affinity predictions are most accurate for the complexes involving hla-a*02: <dig>  <cit> , and 2) the availability of crystal structures of the complexes involving hla-a*02: <dig> allows us to accurately identify the peptide positions that are important or not important for the binding interactions with a t-cell receptor  or antibody. to predict potential off-targets, we identify peptides in the human proteome that are similar to a target peptide, two peptides are more similar if they have more amino acids identical in identical peptide positions. the identification of non-important positions allows us to ignore a peptide as a candidate off-target if it is mostly similar at positions that are not important for the binding interactions with tcr or antibody. thus, we avoid overestimating the number of the off-target peptides to some extent.

although the strategy described here is focused on hla-a*02: <dig>  it can be used to predict cross-reactivity of complexes involving any other hla allele if binding affinities of complexes can be estimated. we slightly modified our strategy to make cross-reactivity predictions for the magea <dig> peptide evdpighly-hla-a*01: <dig> complex  <cit> . in the step  <dig> of our strategy, netmhcstab webserver was used to predict binding affinities for all 9-mer peptides  in complex with hla-a*01: <dig> instead of hla-a*02: <dig>  <cit> . since very few crystal structures of peptide-hla-a*01: <dig> complexes are available, it was not possible to discriminate important and not-important peptide positions. we identified  <dig> potential off-targets that are expressed in essential, normal tissues and could result in off-target toxicity. even though the number  <dig> could be an overestimate because we were not able to discriminate the importance of peptide positions, most importantly, the peptide esdpivaqy from titin  was identified as the off-target with the highest expression in essential, normal tissues among the  <dig> potential off-targets.

there are some limitations to our strategy, several of which could be addressed in future work. 1) it is limited to 9-mer peptides and hla-a*02: <dig>  but can be easily expanded in the future by taking advantage of the peptide-hla binding prediction algorithms that can handle peptides of varied lengths and different hla alleles. 2) it employs computational predictions of peptide-hla binding affinities, although we consider even a weakly binding peptide  as a potential complex, we could still miss some potential peptides that are predicted to be non-binders, but actually are binders. 3) it ignores two important components of the mechanism by which a peptide gets presented at the cell surface by a hla molecule. proteasomal cleavage and tap -peptide binding are critical for peptide presentation along with peptide-hla binding  <cit> . there are a few computational algorithms available that predict proteasomal cleavage likelihood of a peptide  <cit>  and tap-peptide binding  <cit> , but these algorithms are less accurate. however, development of improved algorithms in the future would allow us to incorporate them in our strategy. 4) it explores the full canonical human proteome to identify targets and off-targets, which means that any peptide that is part of gene isoforms  <cit>  or common allelic variations is ignored. our future work will address this issue by exploring the full human proteome in more detail, however it needs to be emphasized that even if we analyze the full proteome by including every known isoform, a patient can have novel isoforms of a protein  that have not been discovered so far.

it needs to be emphasized that the targets and the associated off-targets that we have discovered require experimental validation which is beyond the scope of our purely in-silico work. given the computational limitations described above, a subset of the targets and associated off-targets may not be validated. that is precisely the reason we have not filtered out any potential target based on the cross-reactivity analysis. instead we have only used it to prioritize potential cancer-specific targets and have purposefully erred on the side of caution.

CONCLUSIONS
to date, a simple two-step strategy has been used to discover cancer-specific peptide-hla targets for engineered t-cell or antibody therapy. such a strategy involves the discovery of cancer-specific genes in the first step followed by the identification of the hla binding peptides in the next step. virtually no attention is given to the likelihood of toxic cross-reactivity which has led to the focus on magea <dig> and other cancer-testes antigen genes that are not expressed in essential, normal human tissues. however, clinical trials have shown the dangers involved in not considering the potential off-targets in therapies involving peptide-hla targets. our strategy provides a unique approach to discovering cancer-specific peptide-hla targets for engineered t-cell or antibody therapy. the prioritized target list derived from the comprehensive exploration of the human peptidome presents a fresh starting point for the systematic discovery of specific peptide-hla targets in various cancer types which will hopefully lead to the development of therapies with minimal off-target toxicity.
