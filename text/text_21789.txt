BACKGROUND
negative energy balance  which is characterized by gluconeogenesis and lipodystrophy is the pivotal point and common pathological foundation of ketosis and fatty liver. liver and fat tissue are the major organs of lipid metabolism and take part in modulating lipid oxidative capacity and energy demands, which is also a key metabolic pathway that regulates neb development during the perinatal period.

fgf- <dig> is a recently discovered protein hormone that is found commonly in liver. fgf- <dig> plays an important role in regulating adipose lipid metabolism and liver gluconeogenesis in humans and mice. recent experimental studies on mice have identified brown adipose tissue as one of the key sources of fgf- <dig> when exposed to cold conditions. it is mainly through beta adrenaline and cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which mediates norepinephrine, and, finally an activated protein kinase to mediate the process of fgf- <dig> gene transcription and fgf- <dig> protein release  <cit> . experimental studies have also identified that fgf- <dig> had a protective effect on diet induced obesity  mice, and an increase in energy expenditure and fat utilization were found in further studies . the expression of fgf- <dig> in the murine liver is tightly regulated nutritionally. it is increased by starvation and ketogenic state and decreased by refeeding  <cit> .

human studies have shown that serum fgf- <dig> levels were significantly higher in type  <dig> diabetes mellitus  patients relative to healthy controls, and this suggests the possibility of direct positive metabolic effects of fgf- <dig> in humans  <cit> . similarly, a positive relationship of serum fgf <dig> levels with liver lipid content and body mass index   <cit>  and an inverse relationship of fgf- <dig> with serum adiponectin levels were found in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  patients. it may indicate that fgf- <dig> regulates mammals in different energy states .

it was clear that the study of the new regulatory factor fgf- <dig> on human and mice yielded important results. however, the state of fgf- <dig> research in dairy cows is just beginning. in contrast to these studies of humans and other mammals, very little is known about the regulation of fgf- <dig> in dairy cows. recent experimental studies have found that the content of fgf- <dig> increased rapidly postpartum and after that maintained a lower level during the perinatal period  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, no information about the dynamic changes in fgf- <dig> levels after dietary intervention in dairy cows is available. in view of the above mentioned research status of fgf- <dig>  there are some key scientific problems that need clarification in the relationship between fgf- <dig> and energy metabolism in dairy cow:no information about how fgf- <dig> exerts a direct influence on energy intake is available, although variation in fgf- <dig> levels during the perinatal period has been reported in dairy cows.

there are still some theoretical issues to be resolved on the effect that changes in energy intake have on fgf- <dig> levels, and the effect that energy intake has on fgf- <dig> levels.



to this end, our aim is to confirm a hypothesis that fgf- <dig> might play the above-mentioned role in dairy cows with neb. non-pregnant, non-lactating dairy cows will be allocated randomly to our experiments to recreate the energy deficit of perinatal period. by means of biochemical technologies and clinical investigation, our preliminary study will document the changes in fgf- <dig> concentration in the blood during energy insufficiency and when being overfed, investigate the relationship between fgf- <dig> and some characteristic parameters related to energy metabolism in the blood, and reveal a regulation for fgf- <dig> on energy balance in dairy cows. our work may provide a new theoretical and practical basis for preventing neb in dairy cows.

discussion
our experiment makes references to perinatal period model reported by schoenberg  <cit> , and our research group adequately improve the design of experiment to study the relationship between serum fgf- <dig> concentration and characteristic parameters related to energy balance in different energy metabolism states. our study demonstrated that dairy cows that were under a controlled-energy diet significantly increased their serum fgf- <dig> levels, but for dairy cows that were under a moderate-energy diet, serum fgf- <dig> levels decreased significantly. fgf- <dig> levels of dairy cows feeding controlled-energy diet was significantly higher than dairy cows feeding moderate-energy diet. at the onset of the experiments , serum fgf- <dig> levels showed no significant change. similarly, other experiments found that short-term fasting  had no effect on serum fgf- <dig> levels. however, an increase in acetobutyric acid level induced a significant increase in ketone bodies, and resulted in a 74 % increase in serum fgf- <dig> levels after 7 days of fasting  <cit> . our study showed a significant decrease in serum fgf- <dig> levels in dairy cows under a moderate-energy diet. collectively, this finding is in agreement with previous studies that serum fgf- <dig> levels and fgf- <dig> gene expression in liver significantly decreased when cows were over-fed  <cit> . in animal models, obesity and t2dm have decreased serum fgf- <dig> levels and reduced fgf- <dig> gene expression  <cit>  and, therefore, proposed that obesity is an fgf21-resistant state  <cit> . dairy cows under a controlled-energy diet showed a significant increase in serum fgf- <dig> levels, which can be interpreted as a response to a low-energy diet  <cit> . a moderate-energy diet led to hyperphagia that was induced in dairy cows by the administration of fgf-21; this is indicative of fgf21-induced effects as a major regulator of feeding. previous studies on changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus of fgf21-dosed dio mice have shown that hyperphagia may occur via a compensatory nutrient, sensing-mediated process  <cit> . this response is due to fgf21-induced increases in energy expenditure due to the elevation in mrnas for appetite-promoting hypothalamic neuropeptides, agouti-related peptide  and nerve peptide y . indeed, these results indicate that fgf- <dig> exerts a direct influence on energy intake and also showe fgf- <dig> as an important endocrine and energy balance state regulator of metabolic homeostasis in dairy cows.

here we showed that the relationship between serum fgf- <dig> levels and energy intake under conditions of negative energy balance. our results demonstrate that serum fgf- <dig> levels increased significantly under neb, induced by low-energy intake. similarly, fgf- <dig> levels exhibited a long-term increase after parturition under neb that was induced by a restriction of feed during late lactation. these results are consistent with our experimental findings, which showed that a lack of energy was the key factor that led to the increase in serum fgf- <dig> levels in early-lactation. this result also illustrates that fgf- <dig> levels are closely related to the regulation of energy metabolism. our correlation analysis showed that fgf- <dig> levels had an inverse relationship with blood glucose. on the contrary, fgf- <dig> levels were not significantly related to insulin levels, which suggests that changes in fgf- <dig> levels is independent of variation in insulin levels. previous experimental studies have similarly shown that fgf- <dig> can stimulate the uptake of non-insulin-dependent glucose  <cit>  and that it has a positive impact on insulin sensitivity  <cit> .

current experimental research has shown that fgf- <dig> is a significant metabolic regulator that is produced primarily by the liver; it is necessary for normal activation of hepatic lipid oxidation, removal of triglycerides, ketogenesis induced by ketogenic diet, and adapting to fasting  <cit> . our study demonstrated that serum fgf- <dig> levels and energy intake are closely related in dairy cows, and we also demonstrated the tendency of fgf- <dig> to vary under two different energy-state diets. the clarification of the molecular mechanism underlying the effects that fgf- <dig> plays in dietary interventions in neb and its potential in the treatment of metabolic abnormalities in dairy cows with metabolic syndrome require further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, serum fgf- <dig> exerts a direct influence on energy intake levels, and serum fgf- <dig> significantly declines under high-energy diets and vice versa. we found that fgf- <dig> levels exhibited a significant positive correlation with serum leptin levels, while we found an inverse relationship between fgf- <dig> with blood glucose and bhba levels.
