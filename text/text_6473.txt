BACKGROUND
phenotypic variation among individuals of the same species triggered by environmental action is an intriguing biological phenomenon that can be found in quite striking manifestations in members of different insect orders  <cit> . in highly eusocial bees  one or a few females  specialize in reproductive tasks, whereas a large number of quasi-sterile individuals  engage in colony maintaining activities  <cit> . this polyphenism is generally determined by discrete switches during postembryonic development, and commences with the differential feeding of female larvae  <cit> . the nutritional stimuli trigger an endocrine response that is manifested by an elevated juvenile hormone  titer in queen larvae when compared to workers . the queen-inducing properties of jh were first demonstrated by wirtz and beetsma  <cit> , who topically applied jh on fourth and early fifth instar worker larvae . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not yet understood. in particular, we are largely ignorant of how nutritional factors affect the endocrine system and alter jh synthesis rates of queens and workers, and how these changes drive caste-specific developmental pathways during metamorphosis.

in apis mellifera, a model system for caste development and division of labor in social hymenoptera, young larvae of both castes are fed with royal jelly, a secretion produced by glands in the head of adult workers. whereas these nurse bees feed copious amounts of royal jelly to queen larvae until they enter metamorphosis, they switch the diet for late instar worker larvae from pure royal jelly to a mixture of glandular secretions with honey and pollen . in addition, prospective queen larvae receive  <dig> times more food than worker larvae  <cit> . as a consequence of this differential feeding regime the two types of larvae follow two very different developmental trajectories, in spite of having exactly the same genetic background. conceptually, this process of caste differentiation involves two kinds of alterations in the original developmental pattern : one type, which we can call incremental alterations, affects the general growth of the body or specific organs, especially the ovaries. the other type can be considered as character state alterations that result in the presence or absence of entire specific structures, such as the pollen-collecting apparatus on the hind legs, wax glands, etc. both types of alterations can be envisaged as jh threshold responses controlling the expression of genes involved in the development of specific organs and in specifying the general body plan .

the first large-scale study on the molecular biology of caste differentiation was done in a. mellifera by severson et al.  <cit> . these authors demonstrated by in vitro translation analyses that queens and workers differ in their mrna profiles during larval and prepupal stages. later studies by corona et al.  <cit>  and evans and wheeler  <cit>  found that most of the differentially expressed genes between prospective queens and workers were related to metabolic processes, and specifically, that queens up-regulate metabolic enzymes. conversely, workers were shown to up-regulate a member of the cytochrome p <dig> family, hexamerin  <dig>  dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and a fatty-acid binding protein. in addition, these studies revealed that several regulatory genes such as the mitochondrial translation initiation factor , a member of the ets family of transcription factors with a dna binding domain, were also up-regulated in worker larvae  <cit> .

in a recent study, cristino et al.  <cit>  examined the up-stream regulatory elements associated with all transcripts previously found to be differentially expressed in worker and queen larvae. they confirmed that the majority of the annotated differentially expressed genes  are related to metabolic processes, with an interesting dichotomy for enzymes with hydrolase and oxidoreductase activities, which were found to be up-regulated in workers and queens, respectively. genes up-regulated in workers were also shown to share more common  overrepresented cis-elements when compared to genes up-regulated in queens.

while the aforementioned studies support the notion that incremental alterations are associated with the differential expression of physiometabolic genes, the nature of genetic mechanisms underlying the development of worker distinctiveness or character state alterations remains to be understood.

here we used cdna microarrays to monitor differential gene expression in honeybee queen and worker larvae and to identify cis-acting elements associated with these two developmental trajectories. graph theory and complex networks concepts were adopted to attain an objective visual representation of the connectivity between motifs and genes in both castes. we identify groups of genes responsible for the development of queen and worker singularities and describe how their expression is co-regulated during critical stages of larval development. we also discuss the role of morphogenetic hormones in the developmental process of queen-like character and finally, propose a model of caste differentiation in a. mellifera.

RESULTS
differential gene expression in developing queens and workers
we performed cdna microarray analyses on a set of more than  <dig>  unique genes throughout larval development of honeybees and identified a total of  <dig> genes as differentially expressed between queens and workers in the analyzed stages, namely l <dig>  l <dig> and l5s <dig> , accession number gse6452). only genes that met stringent statistical criteria  were selected as primary candidates.

out of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes , the majority  were up-regulated in fourth instar larvae ,  <dig> were up-regulated in prospective queens and  <dig> in worker-destined larvae . third instar larvae  showed  <dig> degs and the fifth instar spinning stage larvae  contributed with  <dig> degs . this indicates that major changes in gene expression take place during the period of nutritional switch, in an environment with relatively high levels of jh for both queens and workers. interestingly, out of  <dig> degs in l <dig> larvae the overwhelming majority  were found in workers, possibly reflecting the higher growth rate of young worker larvae  <cit> . additional  <dig> genes were found to be up-regulated in jh-treated larvae. these ests most likely represent jh-responsive genes  because they reflect transcriptional changes occurring between  <dig> h and  <dig> hrs after hormone application.

our functional classification of the honeybee degs based on drosophila melanogaster gene ontology  annotation  reveals that 56% of the queen up-regulated genes and 69% of the worker up-regulated genes do not have known counterparts in drosophila. this predominance of novel  genes up-regulated in worker larvae has not been observed by cristino et al.  <cit>  who analyzed a small sample of  <dig> genes empirically selected as differentially expressed in queen and worker larvae  <cit> .

our finding that many of the up-regulated unique genes appear to be involved in the development of worker morphological and behavioral characteristics is compatible with the complexity of workers' body plan relatively to other insects such as drosophila. when compared to honeybee queens, whose main purpose in life is to lay thousands of eggs, worker honeybees perform a myriad of activities inside and outside the colony and can even engage in reproductive tasks when released from the queen's inhibitory influence.

based on go terms for biological processes, we found that in all examined developmental stages workers up-regulate more developmental genes than queens . the proportion of developmental genes is always around 50% in workers, whereas in queens this proportion is always very low, with a strong bias towards physiometabolic genes. for example, in l <dig> larvae nine developmental genes were found to be up-regulated in workers and none in queens and in l <dig> larvae there were eight such genes in workers and four in queens. considering all developmental stages, workers up-regulated  <dig> genes classified as participating in developmental processes, whereas only five genes were up-regulated in queens. interestingly, all these genes are classified as participating in developmental processes related to morphogenetic differentiation of specific organs, like pollen-collecting and reproductive apparati, nervous system, wax and nasanov's glands, etc.

in agreement with previous work done in apis mellifera  <cit>  and in bombus terrestris  <cit>  we show that most of the known degs are related to physiometabolic processes . among these, l <dig> queen larvae up-regulate five genes related to the metabolism of nitrogenous compounds , while none of these genes appear to be up-regulated in workers. this is consistent with the fact that royal jelly is richer in nitrogen compounds  than worker jelly  <cit> . on the other hand, in l <dig> stage there is only one nitrogen metabolism-associated deg that is up-regulated in both castes, thus suggesting the existence of a maximization of feeding differences between developing queens and workers during l3–l <dig> stages. furthermore, specifically during the l <dig> stage, queens up-regulate more genes associated with cellular localization, protein binding, nucleotide binding, nucleic acid binding, hydrolase and oxidoreductase activities than workers . proteins encoded by these genes are expected to participate in the physiometabolic processes leading to the differential growth of the queen's body.

taken together, the relative proportion of differentially expressed physiometabolic genes is not unexpected, since most genes expressed during the honeybee life cycle are classified as belonging to three main categories; metabolic, cell growth and/or maintenance processes . this phenomenon is additionally aggravated in queen larvae, whose development is shifted towards a general growth.

differentially expressed genes related to the most conspicuous caste characteristics
within the physiometabolic category there are some degs encoding metabolic enzymes and also genes whose products are known to regulate the rate of mass-transforming processes and the general growth of the organism . conversely, many genes that are well-characterized in d. melanogaster and in other model organisms may underlie processes leading to the development of caste-biased structures. for example, genes participating in neurogenesis, leg development, apoptosis, and genes coding for components of the cellular matrix . the protein sequences of  <dig> degs clustered by functional groups were searched against a protein domains database , as an additional support for the putative biological roles assigned by homology to the drosophila's counterparts . the first three processes mentioned above are the basis for the respective morphological differences favoring the worker caste, thus defining the adult skills early in development: learning and memory, pollen and propolis collection, and a reduced reproductive capacity. the up-regulation in worker larvae of components of the cytoskeleton may reflect an early production of muscle elements, fundamental for the adult flight activities.

with regard to hormonal control of larval development, the experiment with jh treatment of developing worker larvae allowed us to identify  <dig> 'jh-responsive' genes involved either directly or indirectly in jh signaling, specifically during the critical period of caste development. ten degs that were identified in both jh and caste assays were clustered as "jh responsive + caste" genes . six genes were found in both jh treated larvae and l <dig> queens, and four genes were held in common between jh controls and l <dig> workers.

genes for differential growth
queens up-regulate more physiometabolic genes than workers. moreover, a vast majority of these genes code for products with protein-binding activities like chaperonins or chaperon binding proteins and ribosomal and proteasome related proteins with endopeptidase activities .

a fundamental key controller of physiometabolic processes, also up-regulated in l <dig> queens, is a member of the insulin-signaling pathway tor. this conserved gene regulates translation initiation in response to nutrients from yeast to mammals. in the insect fat body, tor acts as a sensor of amino acid levels in the hemolymph  <cit> . when there are sufficient amino acids available, the activation of the tor system triggers the expression of als protein , a member of a systemic communicational pathway, which signals to other larval tissues, in a pi3k-dependent manner, the nutritionally favorable situation of the organism  <cit> . in corpora allata, the activation of tor pathway could trigger the synthesis of juvenile hormone, one of the central regulators of insect development. other responsive organs are the ovaries, where cell proliferation has been demonstrated to be responsive to the insect's nutritional environment  <cit> .

acting together with tor in determining differential growth between queens and workers are creg and crc . creg , that is up-regulated in l <dig> workers, is a secreted glycoprotein. in humans, it antagonizes cellular transformation by e1a and ras  <cit> . crc encodes a drosophila homolog of vertebrate atf <dig>  a member of the creb/atf family of basic-leucine zipper  transcription factors. this protein  participates in a conserved mechanism of sensing amino acid deprivation and stress induction  <cit> . thus, the up-regulation of tor in prospective queen larvae and of creg and crc in prospective worker larvae may constitute a dual system of growth determination in response to differential feeding in honeybees.

genes for differential neurogenesis
learning and memory-related skills that honeybee workers use for navigation, foraging, nestmate recognition, and other activities are believed to be associated with the prominent regions of insect brains, the mushroom bodies  <cit> . as expected, the ratios typically used to evaluate the relative size of specific brain areas versus the body size support the notion that workers have bigger and more developed mushroom bodies than queens  <cit> . we found that five genes encoding proteins that participate in neural system development in drosophila and in vertebrates  are up-regulated in developing worker larvae . since the nervous system in queens and workers begins to differentiate during post-embryonic stages  <cit>  these five genes are candidates for molecular determinants of the observed morphological differences in developing brains.

genes for differential leg development
the making of an insect leg is a complex process that is even more complicated in worker honeybees because of the presence of unique structures for pollen and propolis collection  <cit> . we found three genes to be up-regulated in l <dig> workers that have been shown to act as regulators of leg development  and one gene regulating bristle morphology  in drosophila  <cit> . this finding is consistent with the importance of bristles morphology and density for the pollen-collecting apparatus  <cit> . the temporal expression of these genes during leg imaginal disc development in the critical period of caste differentiation suggests that they have been recruited, together with other  genes, to regulate the alternative leg structures in a. mellifera castes.

genes for differential ovary development
programmed cell death  is a process that, in concert with cell proliferation, modulates the development of specific organs during metazoan ontogenesis. in insects, this process is commonplace during larval nervous system development and during metamorphosis, where major systems reorganization occurs. in the honeybee, pcd in the worker ovary reduces the number of ovarioles during metamorphosis from 150– <dig> primordia to less than  <dig>  it has been shown that this phenomenon is prevented from occurring in queen larvae by high titres of jh  <cit>  that may inhibit the ecdysteroid-triggered pcd, as suggested for drosophila  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  several genes preferentially expressed in worker larvae are associated with pcd. among these are the cathepsin d gene   <cit> , and a gene coding for a lysozyme that participates in autophagic cell death of salivary glands in drosophila, cg <dig>  <cit> . we also found atx <dig>  gene up-regulated in l <dig> workers. the transgenic over-expression of atx <dig> in drosophila results in female sterility, possibly by impairing the adhesion between oocytes and follicular cells  <cit> . another example of genes up-regulated in worker larvae is traf <dig> . its product participates in both autophagic cell death and induction of apoptosis in drosophila. several genes up-regulated in l <dig> queens are similar to drosophila and human genes coding for proteins with anti-apoptotic activity. one of them is lethal tumorous imaginal discs tid; 34). another one is trap <dig>  an unfolded protein binding protein and a member of the heat-shock family of proteins that may play an important role in the suppression of apoptosis caused by formation of ros  <cit> . in addition, tor, which is also up-regulated in l <dig> queens, is a negative regulator of autophagic cell death  <cit> . thus, when activated by factors acting downstream of the insulin receptor, tor could provide a link between nutrient availability and the regulation of tissue disintegration, such as in the ovarian tissue of honeybees. taken together, all these genes are likely to participate in the regulatory processes underlying the differential reproductive capacity of honeybee queens and workers.

other genes differentially expressed between developing queens and workers
several degs that are up-regulated in worker larvae code for cytoskeleton constituents . among these are genes encoding myosin ii heavy chain , actin, , troponin t, and the genes upheld, shot, lva and ank <dig>  in honeybees, muscle development continues until the early fifth instar allowing for the replacement of larval muscles by imaginal muscles during metamorphosis  <cit> . one explanation for this increased expression of several cytoskeletal genes associated with muscle development may be the differential flight ability of adult honeybee workers. the differential expression of muscle related genes has also been observed in a closely related stingless bee, melipona quadrifasciata  <cit> . finally, l <dig> workers differentially express the usp  gene that codes for the ecdysone receptor partner and a strong candidate for a jh receptor in insects  <cit> , including honeybees  <cit> .

juvenile hormone induces queen-like characteristics by preferentially up-regulating the expression of physiometabolic genes
inspired by the widely known effect of jh on caste differentiation in honeybees  <cit>  we examined gene expression in worker larvae following the application of exogenous jh-iii. we found four genes  to be up-regulated in l <dig> larvae  <dig> h after jh treatment against three up-regulated genes  in control l <dig> workers. ccp84ad that is highly expressed in l <dig> queens is annotated as a structural component of larval cuticle  <cit> . since l <dig> queen larvae have high titres of endogenous jh  <cit> , this rapid and positive regulation of ccp84ad by jh suggests that this is an early responsive gene in the expression cascade promoted by jh. tsp5d, a tetraspanin protein gene, is up-regulated in control l <dig> workers. a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins resides in cell surfaces of growth cones facilitating synapse formation during drosophila neurogenesis  <cit> . thus, since queen larvae have higher titres of jh, the repression by exogenous jh of the expression of a gene  that participates in cone growing, makes this protein a candidate player in worker neurogenesis.

among the  <dig> degs identified as up-regulated at  <dig> h after jh treatment,  <dig> were found to be induced and  <dig> repressed by this hormone. interestingly, the majority of jh-responsive genes with known orthologs in drosophila are physiometabolic genes . the exceptions are unzipped , which participates in axonogenesis processes  <cit> , cathepsin l , implicated in cell death processes  <cit>  and embryonic aldolase  <cit> . out of the  <dig> jh responsive genes,  <dig> have known drosophila orthologs.

previous studies have shown that jh treatment accelerates behavioral maturation in young bees  <cit>  and plays a role as an organizer of the mushroom bodies  <cit> . recently, a microarray analysis was used to understand the effects of a jh analog  on brain gene expression profiles during behavioral maturation of honeybee workers  <cit> . methoprene induces significant forager-like changes in gene expression even in workers with no foraging experience suggesting that the increase in jh titres may be related to expressional changes occurring during the natural transition from hive to forager behavior  <cit> . interestingly,  <dig> out of  <dig> jh responsive degs identified in our work  in worker l <dig> larvae overlap with degs in the brain of adult workers treated with methoprene in the study reported by whitfield et al.  <cit> . the effects of jh-like compounds caused the same shift in gene expression for  <dig> degs in both assays. of particular interest are two degs considered as markers for behavior, namely hsc70cb  and rfabp   <cit> . in our study, hsc70cb and rfabp were up-regulated in queen larvae and in worker larvae, respectively. furthermore, these two degs change their expression profiles in a hormone-dependent manner as observed in worker l <dig> larvae  and young adult worker bees  <cit> . rfabp transcription was down-regulated by jh treatment in two very different stages of bee development . on the other hand, hsc70cb was up-regulated by jh treatment in worker l <dig> larvae as observed in queen l <dig> larvae  but was down-regulated by methoprene treatment in young adult bees  <cit> . the contrasting effects of jh on hsc70cb expression during different life stages are interesting examples of how hormones can exert their regulatory effects on genes expression in a context-dependent manner. until recently, only a small number of insect genes had been described as being either directly or indirectly regulated by jh  <cit> . consequently, this study and the reported by whitfield  <cit>  represent a significant expansion of this functional category.

finally, and as shown in figure  <dig>  jh treatment induces a queen-like expressional pattern. physiometabolic and localization genes are up-regulated in jh-treated workers, whereas developmental genes are up-regulated in control workers. these results support the notion that jh is a potent activator of physiometabolic processes and exerts its role by inducing incremental alterations.

motif analysis in the upstream control regions suggests that some genes are co-regulated
most of the genes identified as differentially expressed between the two castes have been assigned to functional groups according to the literature and functional databases . we hypothesized that the groups of degs sharing common expression patterns might be used to infer putative clusters of co-regulated genes by means of computational analyses of dna-sequence motifs  <cit> .

a motif discovery pipeline was run on  <dig> sets of functional groups  and on two sets of top <dig> degs observed in the l <dig> stage . nine sets of genes show significant differences in the distribution of motif scores when compared to control  sets . the datasets neurogenesis , leg development , apoptosis/other proteins , cytoskeleton/cytoskeleton proteins , cytoskeleton/transcription associated proteins , cytoskeleton/other proteins , jh responsive/protein binding , hormone+caste  and top10-wl <dig>  show evidences for the occurrence of more conserved motifs than expected by chance, but only  <dig> motifs were considered as overrepresented  in  <dig> functional groups . no similarity was found by aligning these eight motifs with d. melanogaster binding site sequences described in the transfac database  <cit> .

m = log <dig> of the gene expression differences between developing queen and worker samples .  up-regulated in workers. n.d.: not determined.

* p <  <dig> ; ** p <  <dig>  for the four metrics.

the upstream control regions  of worker top <dig> genes have significantly more overrepresented dna-sequence motifs than queen top <dig> genes . this result is in agreement with cristino et al.  <cit>  who reported that the number of overrepresented motifs discovered in worker genes was much higher than in queen genes. interestingly, at least two of the discovered motifs were found in ucrs of  <dig> genes  that were not part of the dataset used in the motif discovery pipeline. two queen degs showed putative binding sites for cf1-usp . in workers, a group of four degs has binding sites for cf1-usp and three degs for ecr-usp .

the main interactions among the queen degs are around the motifs discovered in jh responsive datasets . interestingly, hsc70cb gene has all four hormone-related motifs  in its ucr. on the other hand, worker degs are largely organized around the motifs found in the top10-wl <dig> dataset . the localization of three up-regulated genes, gb <dig> , gb <dig>  and gb <dig> , in the worker's network  is particularly informative. the motifs for the binding of ecr-usp and the best motif of the top10-wl <dig> dataset  were found in the ucr of usp itself, indicating that this gene can be regulated by a protein that is important for transcriptional control in workers and also by its own protein when heterodimerized with ecr, as suggested by barchuk et al.  <cit> . in crc gene, up-regulated in workers, we found three motifs, cf1-usp and two top10-wl <dig> motifs , suggesting that crc can be regulated by usp and other regulatory proteins important for worker pattern development. rfabp gene was also found to be up-regulated in workers by evans and wheeler  <cit>  and we show that it is up-regulated in worker larvae and responds negatively  to jh treatment. in adult workers, rfabp expression is repressed by a jh analog  <cit>  and has been considered a nurse marker gene  <cit> . two motifs were found in the rfabp ucr, cf1-usp and the best motif of the "hormone+caste" dataset , suggesting that rfabp can be regulated by usp and also by another regulatory protein involved in jh response. taken together, the available data indicate that these caste determining genes  seem to play an additional important role in regulating major phenotypic changes in honeybee development.

after searching for matches of at least 60% similarity to the discovered motifs and the two canonical patterns, cf1-usp and ecr-usp, for the ucrs of  <dig> degs , we designed putative transcriptional networks based on the occurrence of overrepresented motifs in the ucr of degs between a. mellifera castes . the first type of network considered here, illustrated in figure  <dig> is a bipartite network involving both motifs and genes. the second type of network, illustrated in figure  <dig> depicts only genes and their interrelationship. figure  <dig> shows that most motifs, except for "hormone" and "apoptosis" motifs, are plotted above the main diagonal line  and regulate more genes in workers.

the similar clustering coefficients obtained for workers  and queens  indicates similar dense connectivity among the immediate neighbors of each gene. nevertheless, the degree measure shows that the worker network is substantially denser  showing more interconnections than that obtained for queens , which has also a more modularized system . in agreement with cristino et al.  <cit> , this result indicates that workers genes are more strongly interrelated . moreover, the obtained networks show that worker degs share significantly more conserved motifs than expected by chance.

all the results presented here suggest the existence of groups of co-regulated genes and highlight potential key genes  which might determine developmental processes leading to the formation of caste-specific morphogenetic fields.

CONCLUSIONS
towards a unified model of caste differentiation in the honeybee
in an attempt to consolidate our results with published data, we propose the following model for caste differentiation in a. mellifera . the type of food eaten by the larva must first be recognised by the receptor system in the gut epithelial cells followed by complex signalling via the stomatogastric nervous system  that sends the information to the brain and the retrocerebral endocrine system. corpora allata  activity and the behavior of target tissues may be even under the upstream regulation of insulin/igf molecules eventually secreted by the neurosecretory cells of the larval brain  <cit> , as suggested for drosophila . the other sensing organ, the fat body , receives the information directly from the hemolymph. thus, high level inputs in these organs in prospective queens result in the activation of the insulin/igf pathway and the tor system, which in turn increases the levels of jh synthesis in the ca, and may trigger the als-mediated systemic communicational pathway in fb. "worker jelly", on the other hand, affects insulin/igf pathway in a less pronounced manner, and may not be able to increase the levels of jh above a specific threshold.

as a result of the activated signaling pathways, the high titres of jh in prospective queens regulate the expression of physiometabolic genes that together with the available nutrients from royal jelly determine the general body growth pattern. in this model, the up-regulation of tor in prospective queen larvae can be seen as a determinant of the observed differential growth rates. on the other hand, low levels of jh combined with limited nutrient availability in prospective workers lead to the development of smaller adults. in this case, the up-regulation of creg and crc  in workers may constitute the second determinant of a dual system of growth regulation in response to differential feeding in honeybees.

furthermore, reaching a jh threshold in prospective queens  not only permits general body growth but also acts by negatively regulating the development of some organismal systems that are characteristic of adult workers and are also present in the original developmental pattern. high levels of jh may, for instance, inhibit the development of worker-specific leg structures  <cit> , as well as prevent cell death in the ovaries, leading to a higher number of ovarioles in adult queens. moreover, jh is likely to control the extended brain development specifically that of mb, resulting in bigger worker brains when compared to queen brains  <cit> . thus, jh has contrasting effects on growth and development, at least on certain structures and might be regulating trade-off processes during caste differentiation in a. mellifera.

supporting our general model, the genes in the queen putative regulatory network are mainly associated with motifs discovered in the hormone responsive dataset . in contrast, the genes  in the worker network are mainly connected via worker- and apoptosis-biased motifs.

several steps of the proposed pathway leading to caste development have better experimental support than others. without doubt, the proximate mechanism linking tor activity and jh synthesis  are still unclear. we also have to investigate whether an als-like mechanism of systemic communication of the organism's nutritional condition is functional in honeybees . we further need to deepen our understanding of a number of molecular pathways that are critical for the establishment of caste identities, including the development of the nervous system, ovaries and legs. finally, silencing key genes like usp, crc and rfabp in developing workers and tor in queens would be particularly advantageous in gaining novel insights into the behavior of the proposed regulatory networks.
