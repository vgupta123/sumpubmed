BACKGROUND
carcinomas arise from normal epithelial tissues in a multistep process. the breakdown of epithelial cell homeostasis leading to aggressive cancer progression corresponds with the loss of epithelial characteristics and the acquisition of migratory phenotypes, referred to as epithelial to mesenchymal transition , and is believed to be a crucial event in tumor progression and endows cancer cells with invasive and metastatic competence  <cit> . in a transformation attempt, however, we have observed complete emt from benign prostate epithelial cells  to cells with a mesenchymal phenotype  without malignant transformation  <cit> . to achieve transformed prostate cells, ept <dig> cells were kept growing in extended saturation density culture to select for cells overriding quiescence. many foci formed in ept <dig> cell monolayers. cells  were isolated from the foci and were found to have acquired several malignant features, such as anchorage independent growth, much higher abilities to proliferation at confluence, increased resistance to apoptosis and much lower dependence on external growth factors compared with ep156t and ept <dig> cells. both cytogenetic and dna fingerprinting analyses revealed genetic identity of the three cell lines and confirmed progeny authenticity of the cell model. ept <dig> cells did not, however, form tumors in animals suggesting their being at an early transformation stage and additional induction is required for full malignant transformation  <cit> . this stepwise cell model provides a good opportunity to understand the mechanisms of emt and its role in subsequent accumulation of malignant features in vitro.

epigenetic modifications, especially histone and dna methylations, have a large impact on the regulation of gene expression and are critical in establishing patterns of gene repression during development  <cit> . previous genome-wide maps of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> and lysine  <dig> tri-methylation  showed a very clear correlation between h3k4me <dig> and expressed genes and h3k27me <dig> and repressed genes in embryonic stem cells  <cit> , t cells  <cit> , hematopoietic stem cells/progenitor cells  <cit>  and in prostate cancer cells  <cit> . dna methylation  is a widely accepted gene expression silencing mark and was considered as coupled to h3k27me <dig> through enzymatic interaction  <cit> . genome-wide mapping of dname, however, revealed that most strong cpg island promoters are unmethylated even when they were inactive, and low cpg content promoters are predominantly methylated although this methylation does not preclude gene expression  <cit> . furthermore, global profiling of epigenetic silencing marks in prostate cancer cells showed that h3k27me <dig> modified loci excluded dna hypermethylation  <cit> . all these recent findings suggest that the complex epigenetic regulation based on histone methylation and dna methylation is far from understood.

epigenetic analysis of genes critical for emt has been performed, but limited to very few genes including e-cadherin. evidence was first presented that dna hypermethylation may be a mechanism of e-cadherin inactivation  <cit> . however, a recent report showed that reversible histone modifications rather than dna demethylation are the predominant factors in reactivation of e-cadherin expression  <cit> . apart from this e-to-n cadherin switch, we also found that p-cadherin, a basal cell-specific epithelial mark  <cit> , is significantly down-regulated in ept <dig> cells  <cit> . regarding the epigenetic modifications of n-cadherin and p-cadherin genes, very little information is available. considering the conflicting observations above and that the epigenetic regulation of most of the critical genes of emt is unknown, genome-wide profiling of the epigenetic modifications during emt is highly desirable.

taking advantage of the striking gene expression reprogramming associated with emt and the subsequent acquisition of defined malignant features of our present model and comprehensive analysis of histone and dna methylations based on the same promoter microarray platform, we describe here the dynamic epigenetic change patterns of critical genes for emt and provide the first blueprint of epigenetic modification during emt in prostate cells.

RESULTS
genome-wide profiling of histone methylation, dna methylation and gene expression in prostate cells
profiling of histone and dna methylation of ep156t, ept <dig> and ept <dig> cells was performed using chromatin immunoprecipitation  and methylation dna immunoprecipitation  protocols followed by human promoter microarrays containing  <dig> k 60-mer probes, which cover  <dig>  kb upstream to  <dig>  kb downstream of the transcription start sites of  <dig>  defined human refseqs . histone or dna modification intensities were indicated by the normalized value of log <dig> ratios between ip signals and control signals. probes with intensity above  <dig> were considered as significant. the quality of human promoter microarray hybridizations was validated by quantitative pcr , showing that most of the detected regions have similar modification patterns as found by promoter microarray profiling.

as shown in figure 1b, near 80% of all significant h3k4me <dig> probes were in common between ep156t & ept <dig> and ept <dig> & ept <dig> cells, suggesting that h3k4me <dig> modification patterns were quite similar between these cells, thus underscoring the high reliability of the platform. much fewer common h3k27me <dig> and dname probes were detected among ep156t, ept <dig> and ept <dig> cells, suggesting that these cell lines have very different modification patterns of h3k27me <dig> and dname. total intensities including the promoter and gene body were used to define epigenetically marked genes based on a threshold of  <dig>  calculation of significant probes per marked gene suggested that the modification level of dna methylation was much lower than that of both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> in all the three cell lines .

global gene expression analysis was achieved using agilent  <dig> k human dna microarrays containing  <dig> unique gene symbols. the gene expression levels were indicated by the normalized signal intensities with cutoff  <dig> for the lowest and  <dig> for the highest in log <dig> values . previous studies showed that around 25% of genes were highly expressed and 50% of genes were repressed in both normal and cancer human cells  <cit> . the median values of gene expression in ep156t, ept <dig> and ept <dig> cells were quite similar and all were around  <dig>  . so we defined active genes with intensities above  <dig> , while silent genes displayed intensities below  <dig> .

comparing the gene lists of the promoter microarrays and gene expression microarrays,  <dig> genes were covered in both arrays and were used for further analysis. approximately 60%, 26% and 22% of all genes were marked by h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and dname, respectively, in all three cell lines . to further validate the chip-chip and medip-chip data, we selected a set of housekeeping genes  <cit>  and found that these genes are preferably modified by h3k4me <dig> but not by h3k27me <dig> and dna methylation , which is consistent with previous observations  <cit> .

dna methylation is per se only a weak mark of gene repression
it is established that h3k4me <dig> is an active mark while both h3k27me <dig> and dname are marks of silent gene expression  <cit> . we compared the three kinds of epigenetic modifications with gene activities in all three prostate cell lines, as shown for ep156t cells in figure 2a and 2b. as expected, the expression level of the h3k4me <dig> marked gene group was much higher than the total level , and the expression level of the h3k27me <dig> marked gene group was much lower than the total level . surprisingly, the median expression level of the dna methylated gene group was very close to the total level , suggesting that dna methylation, which was regarded as a silencing epigenetic mark of gene activity, showed only slight correlation with gene repression.

the weak correlation between dna methylation and gene activities was also confirmed by scatter plot analysis, as exemplified for ep156t cells. a very evident positive and negative correlation was found between h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> and gene expression, respectively . up to 78% of expressed genes were modified by h3k4me <dig>  and among h3k4me <dig> marked genes, 72% of them were expressed. in contrast, 92% of expressed genes were non-h3k27me <dig> modified, and 80% of h3k27me <dig> modified genes were silent genes. however, among dna methylated genes, 42% of genes were expressed and 58% were silenced. similar relationships were also found in ept <dig> and ept <dig> cells.

dna methylation is a strong silencing mark for genes modified only by dname without h3k4me3
it was very surprising to find that dna methylation correlated only weakly to gene repression, since dna methylation is established in silencing of many individual genes  <cit> . indeed, we also found that most of the top ten methylated genes were completely silenced in all the three cell lines , including runx <dig>  whose promoter has been found previously to be dna hypermethylated in prostate cancer patients  <cit> . considering that up to 60% of genes were modified by h3k4me <dig>  we selected genes that were modified only by dna methylation without the additional h3k4me <dig> and compared their methylation intensities and gene expression levels. as exemplified for ep156t cells in figure 2d, among  <dig> dname marked genes,  <dig> genes were considered dname marked only. the expression levels of these dname only marked genes were significantly lower than the levels of all genes  . scatter plots showed that  <dig> % of dname only marked genes were silent genes, which is much higher than the percentage of all dname marked genes  , suggesting that dna methylation is a strong silencing mark of gene expression when it is not co-modified by the active h3k4me <dig> mark. comparable results were found also in ept <dig> and ept <dig> cells.

bivalent h3k4/k27me <dig> is a repressive mark and h3k4me3/dname is an activation mark in prostate cells
bivalent epigenetic modification was first discovered in embryonic stem cells when genes were modified by both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> and showed low transcription activity  <cit> . here, we examined the association between bivalent h3k4/k27me <dig> as well as h3k4me3/dname and gene expression in somatic cells. as shown in figure 3a, h3k4/k27me <dig> modified genes have lower expression levels than all genes and more silenced genes  than expressed genes , suggesting it is a combined silencing mark. this is consistent with previous observations that h3k4/k27me <dig> bivalent promoters showed low transcription activity. however, genes marked by h3k4me3/dname have expression levels higher than all genes  and less silenced genes  than expressed genes , suggesting that h3kme3/dname is a combined activation mark rather than a silencing mark. scatter plots also showed more silent genes than active genes in the h3k4/k27me <dig> group , and more active genes than silent genes in h3k4me3/dname group . comparable results were found also in ept <dig> and ept <dig> cells. it is very interesting to find that genes marked by h3k4me3/dname are preferentially active but not silent genes, which means that misleading conclusions will be drawn if we predict the activities of dna methylated genes without taking into consideration the h3k4me <dig> modification.

there are pronounced differences between the h3k27me <dig> only and h3k4/k27me <dig> groups although both are silencing marks . the percentage of silent genes is much higher  among the h3k27me <dig> only marked genes than among the h3k4/k27me <dig> bivalent genes . furthermore, most of the silenced genes marked by h3k27me <dig> have very low expression level . it is a reasonable estimate that h3k4/k27me <dig> marked genes have moderate, but not very low activity in prostate cells. in contrast, most of the dname only genes  are silent genes, and more h3k4me3/dname marked genes  are active genes  . this finding may explain why dna methylation correlated only weakly to gene silencing at the global level since most  of the dname genes were co-modified by the active mark h3k4me <dig> and therefore were more likely to become expressed.

transcription activities of genes with bivalent marks depend on the relative intensities of active and repressive marks
previous work found that h3k4/k27me <dig> bivalently modified promoters showed low transcription activity and argued that the repressive effect of h3k27me <dig> is epistatic to the activating effect of h3k4me <dig> in a bivalent domain  <cit> . however, we have observed that most of the h3k4/k27me <dig> marked genes have stronger modification signal intensities of h3k27me <dig> than h3k4me <dig> and propose that the transcription activities of genes with double marks are reflected by the relative signal intensities of active and repressive marks.

to examine this hypothesis, we quantitatively calculated the modification signal intensities of genes with both active and silencing marks. we considered h3k4me <dig> intensity as the positive value and h3k27me <dig> or dname intensities as negative values. the net intensity of epigenetic modifications is the sum of positive and negative values. the net epigenetic modification intensities and the gene expression levels of both h3k4/k27me <dig> and h3k4me3/dname marked genes were plotted for the three cell types . very strikingly, in the h3k4/k27me <dig> gene group, as exemplified for ep156t cells, up to 92% of the expressed genes have positive net intensity, which means that most of them have stronger intensity of h3k4me <dig> than of h3k27me <dig>  when it comes to genes with negative net intensities, meaning that the intensity of h3k27me <dig> is stronger than of h3k4me <dig>  most  of them are silent genes. similar patterns were observed for h3k4me3/dname modified genes. most  of the expressed genes have stronger modification signal intensities of h3k4me <dig> than dname, and most  of the genes with negative net intensity are silent genes.

the finding that the transcriptional activity of genes with double marks depends of the relative intensities of active and repressive marks suggested that there is not any dominant effect of h3k27me <dig> over h3k4me <dig> per se. individual genes are more likely to be active genes if the modification intensities of h3k4me <dig> are stronger than h3k27me <dig>  implying more modified sites in the same region. in genes with h3k4/h3k27me <dig> modification, the sum of the h3k27me <dig> signal intensities  is higher than the sum of the h3k4me <dig> intensities , while in genes with h3k4me3/dname, the sum of the dname  is lower than the sum of the h3k4me <dig> signal intensities , which may explain, at the global level, why h3k4/h327me <dig> marked genes showed somewhat lower activity while h3k27me3/dname marked genes showed higher transcription activity.

h3k4me <dig> and dname often co-modified genes but at separate regions
bivalently marked genes as described above have been defined when their promoters contained two different epigenetic marks  <cit> . the fine patterns of co-modification have remained unsettled since one gene might be modified by two marks at two separate regions. here, we examined the co-localization of double marks with bivalently marked probes that were detected with significant intensities for both marks. clustered bivalent probes were defined when at least  <dig> bivalent probes mapped to one gene to distinguish them from more separated sporadic bivalent probes.

as shown in figure 5a, the bivalent probes with lowest and highest frequency at the global level were h3k4/k27me <dig> and h3k4me3/dname, respectively. however, bivalent h3k4/k27me <dig> marks much more often belonged to clustered probes compared to h3k4me3/dname marks, which means that many of the h3k4/k27me <dig> sites colocalized in certain genes, and most of the h3k4me3/dname sites were distributed separately with limited co-localization. actually, we found that many of the significant h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> probes cluster together and form big islands, and most of the bivalent h3k4/k27me <dig> probes were accommodated into these islands , while significant dname probes were often separately distributed with very few clustered dname sites, and the frequency of clustered h3k4me3/dname marks was even lower . we concluded that in prostate cells, dname labeled probes were more often co-labeled by h3k4me <dig> than by h3k27me <dig>  but h3k4/k27me <dig> probes much more frequently clustered within certain genes than h3k4me3/dname probes.

when one gene was modified by both h3k4me <dig> and dname, such as bivalent genes described in figure  <dig> most of the dname marked regions were separated from h3k4me <dig> islands, with very few bivalent h3k4me3/dname probes .

increased histone methylation and decreased dna methylation during emt
it is interesting to know how epigenetic marks change from ep156t to ept <dig> cells during emt, in which striking cell biological and morphological changes were observed. the changed epigenetic modification was calculated as the difference between the intensity of epigenetic marks in ept <dig> cells versus ep156t cells and indicated as delta . only genes with Δ values above  <dig> were considered as differentially epigenetic modified genes. as shown in figure 6a and additional file  <dig>   <dig> % of the analyzed genes have increased h3k4me <dig> marks , while much fewer genes have decreased h3k4me <dig> marks  during emt. similar change was also found for the h3k27me <dig> mark with near twice as many genes with increased marks as genes with decreased marks. in contrast, the dname mark changed in a much lower number of genes, and then more genes exhibited decreased dname marks  than increased dname marks . the observation of increased h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> modification and decreased dname modification during emt is also shown in the detected significant probes in ep156t and ept <dig> cells . there were more significant probes of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> marks and less of dname marks detected in ept <dig> cells than in ep156t cells.

gene ontology was performed to find what kinds of genes have changes of epigenetic modification during emt. the most enriched go terms in genes with increased h3k4me <dig> marks are metabolic process, while the most enriched go terms in genes with decreased h3k4me <dig> mark are developmental process . development related processes are enriched in genes with both increases and decreases of either h3k27me <dig> or dname marks .

dynamic changes of h3k4me <dig> or h3k27me <dig> but not of dname correlate to changes of gene expression during emt
to understand epigenetic regulation of emt at the global level, we examined the dynamic changes of both epigenetic modification and gene expression during emt. the changed gene expression was also calculated as the Δlog <dig> value between two cell lines. only genes with Δ log <dig> values above  <dig> were considered as differentially expressed genes. there were  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes during emt . gene ontology analysis showed that these genes were highly enriched in processes such as ectoderm and epithelium development, cell migration and adhesion , in which emt is widely involved  <cit> . examining the changed epigenetic modifications among these changed genes, we found that most of the up-regulated genes have increased h3k4me <dig> and most of the down-regulated genes have decreased h3k4me <dig> modifications  . in contrast, most of these up-regulated genes have decreased h3k27me <dig> and most down-regulated genes have increased h3k27me <dig> . however, there were no significant differences between genes with increased or decreased dna methylation in either up-regulated or down-regulated genes.

we also examined the changed gene expression of genes with changed epigenetic modifications. the expression levels of the top  <dig> epigenetically changed genes are shown in figure 7b. it is very evident that most genes with increased h3k4me <dig> were up-regulated during emt, while genes with decreased h3k4me <dig> were down-regulated during emt. opposite changes were found for h3k27me <dig>  in which most of the genes with increased h3k27me <dig> were down-regulated during emt, while genes with decreased h3k27me <dig> were up-regulated during emt. however, there was no significant correlation between changed dna methylation and changed gene expression during emt.

epigenetic switches of critical emt-associated genes
ep156t cells were strikingly reprogrammed during emt with loss of multiple epithelial markers and gain of mesenchymal features. one of the most characterized switches is the cadherin switch with down-regulation of e-cadherin and gain of n-cadherin. additionally, we found that p-cadherin, a basal cell-specific epithelial mark  <cit> , is significantly down-regulated in ept <dig> cells  <cit> . based on the epigenetic profiling, we found that the epigenetic promoter modifications of these three cadherins changed significantly among ep156t, ept <dig> and ept <dig> cells . for p-cadherin, its promoter was dominated by h3k4me <dig> and it was highly expressed in ep156t cells. following emt the h3k4me <dig> modification decreased and the repressive marks h3k27me <dig> and dname became stronger than h3k4me <dig> and the expression level of p-cadherin decreased significantly. during the transition from ept <dig> to ept <dig> cells, h3k4me <dig> modifications completely disappeared but h3k27me <dig> increased, and the expression of p-cadherin decreased further. in contrast, the n-cadherin promoter was dominated by repressive marks in ep156t cells, but it became h3k4me <dig> dominated as the expression level strongly increased in ept <dig> cells after emt. during accumulation of malignant features, h3k4me <dig> decreased and repressive marks became stronger again. concomitantly, the expression of n-cadherin reversed to silencing again. for e-cadherin, the epigenetic switch was not significant although the gene expression clearly decreased during emt. however, the continued decrease of e-cadherin expression from ept <dig> to ept <dig> cells was accompanied by significant epigenetic switches with complete disappearance of h3k4me <dig> and increase of h3k27me <dig>  we therefore can report an extensive consistency between epigenetic switches and gene expression switches of n-cadherin and p-cadherin during both emt and early transformation steps. for e-cadherin this consistency was found only at the early transformation step, but not at the emt step, suggesting that the e-cadherin promoter is affected by different regulatory subprograms.

fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  is a known emt inducer whose activation can lead to irreversible prostate adenocarcinoma and emt  <cit> . very interestingly, there is also a switch between fgfr <dig> and another fgfr member fgfr <dig>  the gene expressions between fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> were observed as mutually exclusive in colorectal carcinoma cells and indicated that their reciprocal relationship plays an important role in the progression of the carcinomas  <cit> . fgfr <dig> is also involved in emt by an alternative splicing event between mutually exclusive exons iiib and iiic. the fgfr2-iiib splice variant is exclusive to epithelial cells, while fgfr2-iiic is expressed in mesenchymal cells  <cit> . in our prostate cell model, we found that the activation of fgfr <dig> was accompanied by significant down-regulation of fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> during emt. this switch was kept from ept <dig> to ept <dig> cells . in ep156t cells, the promoter of fgfr <dig> was strongly modified by h3k27me <dig> and dname, and the transcription was completely silenced, while h3k4me <dig> modification increased strongly, but dna methylation decreased and h3k27me <dig> disappeared during emt, accompanied by activation of fgfr <dig> expression. in contrast, the promoter of fgfr <dig> underwent the opposite switch with decreased h3k4me <dig> and increased h3k27me <dig> during emt as the expression of fgfr2-iiib was down-regulated. the epigenetic switches in the promoter of fgfr <dig> involved only h3k27me <dig> and dna methylation, but not h3k4me <dig>  in ep156t cells, the promoter was modified by h3k27me <dig> and dna methylation at very low levels and fgfr <dig> was expressed at middle level, h3k27me <dig> modification strongly increased during emt and fgfr <dig> became completely silenced in ept <dig> cells. from ept <dig> to ept <dig> cells, the promoter of fgfr <dig> was continually dominated by h3k4me <dig> and the expression was still active. the promoter of fgfr <dig> was continually dominated by h3k27me <dig> and the expression was still repressed.

identification of genes with consistent epigenetic switches and expression switches during emt
apart from the cadherins and fgfrs described above, we also identified multiple other important emt-associated genes with consistent changes of histone modifications according to their differential expression . we examined four kinds of combinations including increased h3k4me <dig> & up-regulated genes, decreased h3k4me <dig> & down-regulated genes, increased h3k27me <dig> & down-regulated genes and decreased h3k27me <dig> & up-regulated genes. very interestingly, many of these genes have significant changes of both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> marks. for example, all of the top  <dig> genes  with increased h3k27me <dig> marks were accompanied by decreased h3k4me <dig> modification, and all of the top  <dig> genes  with decreased h3k27me <dig> were accompanied by increased h3k4me <dig> . in addition, many of them were involved in cell junctions, such as gjb <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of gap junctions, cdh <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in cadherin junctions, dsc <dig>  dsg <dig> pkp <dig> and pkp <dig> of desmosomes, as well as krt <dig>  which is expressed especially in the basal layer of the epidermis. all these coordinated epigenetic changes and expression changes of these cell junction genes indicate that histone methylation is very critical in regulating the breakdown of epithelial cell homeostasis and leading to the loss of epithelial characteristics and the acquisition of migratory phenotypes.

discussion
this is the first genome-wide study of histone and dna methylation during emt with subsequent accumulation of malignant features. ep156t are primary benign prostate epithelial cells, ept <dig> are progeny cells that underwent emt without malignant transformation. ept <dig> cells were subsequently derived from ept <dig> cells. ept <dig> cells acquired several well-defined malignant features, including anchorage independent growth, resistance to apoptosis and independence of external growth factors  <cit> . the study revealed consistent relationships between promoter modifications and gene expression patterns both at the global level and concerning many individual genes previously known to play important roles in these processes. it therefore appears that epigenetic modifications are involved in the coordination of entire gene expression programs during emt and early transformation steps. however, ept <dig> cells represent only early transformation and did not form tumors in tested animals  <cit> . the lack of tumorigenicity represents a limitation of this study. work is ongoing to identify the factors that restrict tumorigenicity in the ept <dig> cells even after their acquisition of anchorage independent growth and self sufficiency of growth factors.

most protein coding genes are modified by at least two of the h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> or dname marks  <cit> . one observation of particular interest is that the net modification signal intensities of activating and repressive marks were quantitatively associated with the modified gene activities. the transcriptional level of genes with bivalent marks depends on the relative intensities of active and repressive marks. this is in contrast to an alternative model of "dominance" of one type of mark over the other  <cit> . actually, when it comes to genes with stronger h3k4me <dig> intensity than h3k27me <dig> intensity, these genes are more likely expressed genes. hence, it is very important to examine both active and silent marks before correlation of gene expression activities and epigenetic modifications.

it is widely accepted that dna methylation is a repressive mark of gene activity. however, this concept may have to be modified in several important aspects. for example, dna methylation at certain upstream or downstream promoter sites was associated with higher expression, which may be due to the inhibition of binding of silencers  <cit> . complexity also occurs when dna methylated sites belong to the intragenic region where it can relate to both gene activity and silencing  <cit> . we found that dna methylation is a strong silencing mark only when genes are modified by dname without concomitant h3k4me <dig>  and dna methylation correlates only slightly to promoter repression at the global level. furthermore, a gene modified by both dname and h3k4me <dig> is more likely to be activated. a recent report also found that methylation of dna and not h3k <dig> correlated to suppressed transcription, while gene transcription was only slightly reduced when both dna and h3k <dig> were methylated  <cit> .

we found that dna methylation has less significant effect than histone methylation on prostate cells during emt. firstly, the number of significant dname-detecting probes was much less than for h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  secondly, the modification level of dname was much lower than for both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> in all the three cell lines. thirdly, more h3k27me <dig> marked genes  than dname marked genes  were repressed, indicating that dna methylation correlates weaker than h3k27me <dig> with gene repression. lastly and most importantly, there was no significant correlation between the changed dname modification and changed gene expression. actually, the weak correlation between dna methylation and gene silencing has been observed also when many dna methylation events in cancer occurred at the promoters of genes that were already repressed in the normal tissue, before transformation  <cit> . all these findings were different from the prevailing view that dname plays the critical role in silencing gene expression  <cit> . two technical limitations should be noted, however, since we detected methylated promoter dna using an antibody against 5'-methylcytidine, which preferably recognizes methylated cpg islands with threshold sensitivity  <cit> . however, most cpg islands in the genome are not methylated and methylated dna is more abundantly detected in repeat sequences compared to promoters of protein coding genes  <cit> . the agilent promoter array used in our profiling could be associated with loss of some of the cpg islands present in the cpg island array.

more than half of the protein coding genes were modified by both h3k4me <dig> and dname in our prostate cell lines, fouse et al and li et al also found that 40% and 66%, respectively, of dname marked genes were co-modified by h3k4me <dig>  <cit> , which seems in conflict with an observation that there is a strong anti-correlation between dna methylation and the presence of h3k4me  <cit> . this apparent conflict may be explained by our present examination at higher resolution which shows that dname and h3k4me <dig> marks indeed tend to localize at different sites within the same promoter. this supports that dname and h3k4me <dig> modifications are really mutually exclusive at the same sites  <cit> , but both marks can colocalize in different regions of the same gene bodies.

epigenetic regulation of e-cadherin has been addressed for a long time and in many labs with different results. promoter dna hypermethylation was the first reported epigenetic silencing mechanism of e-cadherin  <cit> . later studies pointed to h3k27me <dig> rather than dna demethylation in e-cadherin repression  <cit> . our findings indicate that epigenetic regulation of the e-cadherin promoter varied at different stages. during emt in our cell culture model, none of the h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> or dname marks were changed in the promoter of e-cadherin even though the transcription of e-cadherin was significantly down-regulated. during subsequent accumulation of malignant features, we detected complete loss of h3k4me <dig> accompanied with full silencing of e-cadherin expression.

CONCLUSIONS
emt is a crucial event in tumor progression. this work presents the first blueprint of epigenetic modifications during emt in prostate cells and shows that specific histone methylations are extensively involved in gene expression reprogramming during emt and subsequent accumulation of malignant features. many genes, especially epithelial cell junction genes, showed corresponding changes concerning epigenetic modifications and gene expression during emt. the observation that transcription activity of bivalently marked genes depends on the relative labeling intensity of each mark provides a new view of quantitative regulation of epigenetic modification.
