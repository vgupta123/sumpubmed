BACKGROUND
proteins involved in sexual reproduction often evolve rapidly due to positive selection  <cit> . although the selective forces are unclear, a variety of hypotheses have been proposed including mate choice, intra-sexual competition and sexual conflict, which are different forms of sexual selection. the rapid evolution of these proteins may contribute to several important biological aspects such as reproduction and speciation. it has long been recognized that gene duplication is a major source of genomic novelties. therefore, the newly duplicated genes involved in reproduction are likely the targets of natural and/or sexual selection.

using exon trapping, van de vosse et al  <cit>  identified a novel gene in human located on xp <dig>  named as scm-like- <dig> , which is similar with the scm gene in drosophila. in the human genome, scml <dig> spans  <dig> kb and contains  <dig> exons. northern blot analysis detected a major scml <dig> transcript of approximately 3-kb in all human adult and fetal tissues tested  <cit> .

scml <dig> gene is a polycomb group  gene. most of the pcg genes are expressed throughout embryonic, larval and pupal development, and are required continuously to maintain restricted homeotic expression in drosophila.  <cit> . most mammalian pcg genes have drosophila homologs  <cit> . compared to drosophila, the mammalian pcg genes have acquired novel functions during evolution because pcg knockout mice exhibit numerous phenotypes including hematopoietic defects, neural crest defects, cardiac anomalies, and sex reversal  <cit> . scml <dig> is likely a recently duplicated gene during mammalian evolution due to the absence of orthologs in drosophila, zebrafish and chicken.

in the scm family, there are other two genes, scml <dig> and scmh <dig>  which have orthologs in all vertebrate species and are located on chromosome xp <dig>  <cit>  and chromosome 1p <dig>  <cit>  respectively. scmh <dig> is a core component of polycomb repressive complex  <dig>   <cit>  which is involved in the maintenance of repression and can block chromatin remodeling <cit> , and it plays an important role in regulation of homeotic genes in embryogenesis <cit> . scml <dig> is also involved in prc1's regulation <cit> . a recent study showed that scml <dig> is over-expressed in acute myeloid leukaemia, suggesting its role in differentiation and cell cycle regulation <cit> . as scml <dig> and scmh <dig> are the ancient copies in the scm family, they would serve as the ideal reference genes when dissecting the molecular evolution of scml <dig> in primates.

through a genome-wide comparison, we have identified  <dig> candidate genes including scml <dig> that showed rapid nonsynonymous sequence divergence between human and chimpanzee  <cit> , therefore an implication of adaptive evolution of these genes during primate evolution. to test whether scml <dig> is the target of selection in primates, we sequenced and compared the coding region of scml <dig> in major primate lineages, and we observed the signature of positive selection.

methods
dna samples
the major lineages of primates were sampled, including three great ape species , two lesser ape species , two old world monkey species  and one new world monkey species . the common ancestor of the tested primate species can be traced back to about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . all the dna samples were from collection in kunming cell bank of cas and kunming blood center in china.

pcr and sequencing
all the samples were sequenced for the full length coding region of scml <dig>  primers for all the primates were designed by aligning the published sequences of human  and macaque . the primer sequences are listed .

pcrs were performed with rtaq under conditions recommended by the manufacturer . sequencing was performed in both directions with forward and reverse primers using the bigdye terminator sequencing kit on an abi  <dig> automated sequencer. there are  <dig> exons in scml <dig> gene, and the first exon is non-translational, therefore, not sequenced in this study. overlapping chromatogram files retrieved from the sequencer were analyzed and edited using the seqman program in the lasergene software package .

sequence analysis
the dna sequences were aligned with the clustalw program implanted in mega  <cit>  and checked manually. there are several in-dels  in the coding region of common marmoset, and those sites were removed in the sequence analysis. the known phylogeny of primate species was used <cit> . the ancestral sequences were inferred by paml  <dig>   <cit> . the synonymous  and nonsynonymous  substitution rates of each branch were calculated with the use of the maximum likelihood method under the free-ratio model  <cit> .

test of selection
positive selection can be inferred from a higher proportion of nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions per site . to detect specific amino acid sites under positive selection, we applied the site models in the codeml program of the paml package. using this set of models, we obtained the log likelihood estimates  of a tree topology under models that impose alternative assumptions in terms of rate variation  over different codon sites  <cit> . the model m <dig> was used to evaluate the general sequence substitution pattern of scml <dig> in primates assuming a constant ω ratio across codon sites. m <dig> estimates the overall ω for the data. the m1a model estimates single parameter, p <dig>  with ω <dig> =  <dig>  and the remaining sites with frequency p <dig>  assuming ω <dig> =  <dig>  we first compared model m <dig> with m1a to determine which model is more realistic for the data and m1a tuned out to be the better one. then we compared model m2a  and m1a  to test if invoking of positive selection in model m2a would better explain the data  <cit> . it was suggested that under certain scenarios, a beta distribution of ω is more realistic, therefore, we also conducted the selection test by comparing model m <dig> and m <dig>  in which a beta distribution of ωwas assumed. we also conducted a more stringent test by comparing m <dig> with m8a. the lrts between nested models were conducted by comparing twice the difference of the log-likelihood values  between two models  <cit> . if the log likelihood test suggests the presence of sites under positive selection, we then identified these sites by using a bayesian method to estimate posterior probabilities   <cit> .

comparative evolutionary analysis among scml <dig>  scml <dig> and scmh1
sequences of scml <dig> and scmh <dig> genes were obtained using blast  for five primate species including human, chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus macaque and common marmoset. the sequence ids are: scml <dig>  homo sapiens , macaca mulatta , pan troglodytess ; scmh <dig>  homo sapiens , pan troglodytess , macaca mulatta . with the use of human scml <dig> and scmh <dig>  we searched the genomes of orangutan and common marmoset with blastn and obtained the coding sequences of these two genes <cit> .

protein sequences were aligned with the clustalw program implanted in mega <dig>  <cit>  and the ω calculation was conducted using the codeml program of paml <dig>   <cit> . the ratios of dn and ds were estimated by using paml <dig> , and the z test was used to evaluate the ratio difference between each branches  <cit> . similar neutrality tests described above were used in comparing the evolutionary patterns among the three genes.

rt-pcr analysis rnas were extracted using the tri-reagent kit based on the manufacturer's specifications . for gene expression analysis of rhesus macaques during development, a total of  <dig> testis samples were analyzed including ten 1– <dig> year old monkeys  and ten 7– <dig> years old monkeys . the t test was used for statistical evaluation of expression difference.

for tissue expression analysis in rhesus macaques, a total of  <dig> tissue types  were analyzed including brain, cartilage, heart, large intestine, small intestine, liver, lung, muscle, pancreas, spleen, stomach and testis. all the rhesus macaque tissue samples were collected from the kunming primate research center, chinese academy of sciences.

for real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis, cdnas were synthesized with superscript™ iii  from  <dig> μg of total rna in a total volume of  <dig> μl with oligo primer in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. syrb green i-based real-time pcr was carried out using the dna engine opticon®  <dig> continuous fluorescence detection system . after an initial denature step for  <dig> min at 94°c, conditions for cycling are  <dig> cycles of  <dig> sec at 94°c,  <dig> sec at 58°c,  <dig> sec at 72°c. at the end of the pcr cycles, a melting curve was generated to identify specificity of the pcr product. for each run, serial dilutions of rhesus macaque gapdh  plasmids were used as standards for quantitative measurement of the amount of amplified dna. in addition, for normalization of each sample, mgapdh primers were used to measure the amount of gapdh cdna. all samples were run in triplicates and the data were presented as a ratio of scml1/gapdh. the Δct values were calculated and then converted into the linear-scale expression levels. oligonucleotides were obtained from invitrogen. negative controls were performed with water as template. the primer sequences are:

gapdh f primer 5'acttcaacagcgacacccactc3'

gapdh r primer 5'ccctgttgctgtagccaaattc3'

scml <dig> f primer 5'ctcctaccctgaaagttatagcc3'

scml <dig> r primer 5'tctgagggatgcactggac3'

immunohistochemical analysis
the liquid nitrogen stored tissue was sectioned  using a hm <dig> tissue processor . the frozen section slides were stored at -80°c in a sealed slide box. sections were stained using the standard immunohistochemical method. the mouse monoclonal antibodies generated using human scml <dig> protein  and the goat anti-mouse igg antibody  were used following the manufacturer's instruction. the negative control used is the buffer-only samples with no mouse antibodies. immuno-reactivity was visualized by using  <dig> %  <dig> '-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride/ <dig> % h2o <dig>  these slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline . the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for a few seconds.

RESULTS
sequence substitution pattern of scml <dig> in primates
a total of nine primate species were sequenced covering the complete 990– <dig>  bp coding region of scml <dig>  there are  <dig> sites  showing sequence substitutions in the nine primate species tested. when translated into protein sequences , there are  <dig> sites  having substitutions, an implication of rapid sequence changes during primate evolution. for example, the protein sequence substitution rates  of scml <dig> between human and old world monkeys are relatively fast  among those male reproduction associated genes in primates  <cit> .

test of selection on scml <dig> in primates
we calculated the dn/ds ratio , which measures the rate of protein evolution as scaled to mutation rate for all the branches. we also obtained the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions for each branch   <cit> . as shown in figure 2a, most of the primate lineages have large ω values  except for orangutan and rhesus macaque, again suggesting rapid amino acid changes during primate evolution.

the rapid protein sequence evolution can be explained either by darwinian positive selection or by relaxation of negative  selection. to test the hypothesis that they could be under darwinian positive selection, we conducted the analysis for positive selection at individual amino acid sites using maximum likelihood models by estimating ω values <cit> . the results are presented in table  <dig>  we first conducted the analysis using m <dig>  in the m <dig> analysis, the log likelihood l is - <dig> , and the estimated ω =  <dig> , implying that there are varied evolutionary forces acting on the amino acid sites of scml <dig> . model m1a  assumes two site classes in the sequence , and is significantly better than m <dig> . therefore, we use m1a as the null hypothesis in detecting selection.

q =  <dig>  
note: * refers to p <  <dig> . ** refers to p <  <dig> ; : m1a versus m <dig>  : m2a versus m1a, : m <dig> versus m <dig> : m <dig> versus m8a. the proportions of sites under positive selection and selective constraint are p <dig> and p <dig> respectively. the parameters p and q are used for the beta distribution b.

we next compared m1a and m2a , and m2a fits the data significantly better than m1a , a strong signature of positive selection on scml <dig> in primates. m2a suggests that  <dig> % of the sites are under positive selection with ω <dig> =  <dig> . in addition, to avoid the potential bias caused by the assumed substitution pattern in m1a and m2a, we also conducted the selection test by comparing m <dig>  and m <dig> , in which a beta distribution for ω over sites was assumed. m <dig> provides significantly better fit to the data than m <dig>  again suggesting positive selection on scml <dig> in primates. m <dig> suggests that  <dig> % of the sites were under positive selection with ω =  <dig> . interestingly, m <dig> demonstrates a u-shaped distribution of beta values, suggesting that most sites are either highly conserved with dn/ds close to  <dig> or nearly neutral with dn/ds =  <dig>  and only a small percentage of the sites were under positive selection. a more stringent test comparing m <dig> and m8a also supports the proposed positive selection . the positively selected sites are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig> <cit> . collectively, all the tests on selection can be better explained by the evolutionary model that invokes positive selection in primates.

evolutionary pattern comparison between scml <dig>  scml <dig> and scmh1
as scml <dig> is likely a recent duplication during mammalian evolution, we compared the evolutionary patterns between scml <dig> and the two other members of the scm family, i.e. scml <dig> and scmh <dig>  which are located on chromosome x and chromosome  <dig> respectively. the sequence alignment is showed in additional file  <dig>  scml <dig> and scml <dig> are only 15-kb apart on chromosome x , and the intron and exon structure at the c terminus are highly conserved between them but with totally different n terminus. the sam domain  is highly conserved among all the three genes . strikingly, when comparing the amino acid sequences of the sam domain among different primate species, scml <dig> have much more between-specie amino acid changes than those of scml <dig> and scmh <dig>  in the m <dig> analysis, the ω values for scmh <dig> and scml <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, which are much smaller than that of scml <dig> . this is an average over all sites in the protein and all lineages in the tree, therefore, suggesting a dominant role of purifying selection in the evolution of scml <dig> and scmh <dig>  with the use of free ratio model, we calculated the dn/ds values of each primate lineages for scml <dig> and scmh <dig>  and all the lineages show strong functional constraint  or neutral evolution  . the expression pattern of the three genes in human is different from each other though all of them are highly expressed in testis  implying functional divergence after gene duplication.

expression analysis of scml1
having shown that the evolution of scml <dig> in primates is consistent with positive selection, by dissecting its expression pattern, we attempt to understand the driving force and the functional consequence of selection. we first detect the expression pattern of scml <dig> by testing  <dig> different tissue types in 1– <dig> year old macaques and the result is shown in figure  <dig>  testis and pancreas have the highest expression when compared with the other tissues. in human, according to the micro-array expression data, scml <dig> is also preferentially expressed in testis  <cit> . the abundant expression of scml <dig> in testis confirms its involvement in male reproduction. however, in humans , liver, fetal liver, and pituitary all show higher expression than pancreas, which is different from the expression pattern of rhesus macaque, implicating functional modifications of scml <dig> during primate evolution. this is consistent with the proposed positive selection on scml <dig> in primates.

we then detect the potential expression change of scml <dig> during male sexual maturation and a significant change was detected in testis. we compared two age groups, i.e. 1– <dig> year old monkeys  and 7– <dig> year old monkeys . the result indicates that both age groups have abundant expression of scml <dig>  and there is a significant reduction  in the adult group  . we next carried out immunohistochemical analysis of the two age groups . the result shows that scml <dig> is preferentially expressed in the germ stem cells of testis   <cit> , and again the 1– <dig> year old group has higher expression than the adult group. the higher expression in the 1– <dig> year old monkeys is probably due to the relative abundance of stem cells at the sexually immature stage. the preferential expression in the stem cells of testis suggests that scml <dig> is likely involved in spermatogenesis during sexual maturation in rhesus macaque.

discussion
we demonstrate that scml <dig> evolves rapidly in primates, which was caused by darwinian positive selection. genes expressed exclusively or preferentially in testis are likely involved in male reproduction and have been shown to evolve rapidly under positive selection in previous studies  is the only known functional domain of scml <dig> <cit> . among primates, the amino acid sequences of the sam domains are relatively conserved across species and there is one site under positive selection . the sam domain is known to exhibit diverse protein-protein interaction modes, and is involved in developmental regulation  <cit> . through functional domain prediction  <cit> , besides of the sam domain, we identified a total of six fragments <cit>   in scml <dig> containing potential functional domains. for example, the fragment 1– <dig> is a signal peptide. the positively selected sites using 95% cutoff are listed in table  <dig>  and most of them are also located in the potential functional domains other than the structural domains . this distribution bias of the positively selected sites indicates that darwinian positive selection on scml <dig> targets the putative functional domains, which is consistent with the proposed functional modification of scml <dig> during primate evolution.

sexual selection is the favored explanation for the observed adaptive evolution of male reproductive genes  <cit> . the immunohistochemical and rt-pcr data suggests that scml <dig> is important for the development and normal function of testis in primates. therefore, it is reasonable to propose that the adaptive evolution of scml <dig> in primates is likely due to sexual selection <cit> . sperm competition, one of the major mechanisms for sexual selection has been used to define the driving force of selection in promiscuous species, e.g. chimpanzee and human, which seems to explain the observed adaptive evolution of scml <dig> since both chimpanzee and human are among the rapidly evolving lineages . however, gibbon is a monogamous species with a high ω value, and the highly promiscuous rhesus monkey does not show accelerated evolution . therefore, the branch-specific rapid evolution of scml <dig> in primates does not provide consistent support for the sexual selection hypothesis. other evolutionary mechanisms need to be tested, e.g. speciation  <cit> .

the origin of scml <dig> probably occurred at the early stage of mammalian radiation about  <dig> million years ago because we do not identify scml <dig> in non-mammalian species, neither in mouse and rat, but in dog, cow and primates. the comparison of evolutionary and expression patterns among the three genes of the same scml family suggests that the rapid evolution of scml <dig> likely led to function modification of testis development and spermatogenesis in primates  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the adaptive evolution of scml <dig> in primates provides a new case in understanding the evolutionary process of genes involved in primate male reproduction.
