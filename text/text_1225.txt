BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing techniques have opened up new opportunities for genomics studies of new model organisms  <cit> . many of these organisms are not amenable to classical genetic techniques; thus their sequenced and annotated genomes are the central resource for experimental studies. the popularity of the planarian schmidtea mediterranea, which can regenerate complete animals from fragments of its body, with stem-cell researchers is one example  <cit> . the cone snail is another.

the cone snails  belong to the superfamily conoidea which probably includes over  <dig>  venomous gastropods  <cit> . the venom from each of the species of cone snails includes a mixture of small cysteine-rich peptides, which are used to immobilize their prey. these small peptides  have exquisite specificity for different isoforms of ion channels, receptors and transporters  <cit> . their disulfide scaffold restricts the conformational space available to a peptide. however, the combination of variable intervening amino acids and their posttranslational modifications enable a spectrum of specific interactions with their target molecules. a typical conopeptide precursor is comprised of three regions: an n-terminal signal peptide, a pro-region, and a mature peptide region. the n-terminal sequence is usually much more conserved than the mature peptide, possibly due to the diversifying selection on the latter  <cit> . conopeptides are classified into super-families, mainly based on the conserved signal peptide and different cysteine patterns observed within the mature peptide.

conopeptides serve as specific neurobiological tools for addressing specific receptors and channels, and are also valuable lead compounds for therapeutic evaluation. a conopeptide, ω-mviia  isolated from conus magus, has been approved by fda for the treatment of chronic pain  <cit> . in addition, other conopeptides are also being evaluated for the treatment of pain and epilepsy  <cit> . it is estimated that the venom of a single species of conus may contain as many as  <dig> different venom peptides  <cit> . this raises the possibility that the 500- <dig> species of cone snails may provide upwards of  <dig>  compounds of potential pharmacological interest, perhaps more when all the members of superfamily conoidea are considered.

we have carried out a sequencing survey of the conus bullatus genome and venom-duct transcriptome. conus bullatus is a fish-hunting cone snail that together with c. cervus and c. dusaveli are members of the subgenus textilia . this is probably the least understood group of fish-hunting conus. all are from the indo-pacific region . conus bullatus is the only accessible member of this clade of species; all others are rare and from deep water. c. bullatus is found from the intertidal zone to about  <dig> m, most commonly from slightly subtidal to  <dig> m, c. cervus between 180- <dig> m and c. dusaveli 50- <dig> m  <cit> .

the pharmacology of the textilia is thus still poorly characterized, and the genomics analyses presented here provide the first step toward a better understanding the enigmatic textilia clade. the biology of the conus species that belong to the textilia clade is mostly unknown, but we recently documented the prey capture behavior of conus bullatus . the general strategy appears to be analogous to that first established for conus purpurascens  <cit> , with one group of venom peptides causing a rapid tetanic immobilization, and a second set eliciting a block of neuromuscular transmission. multiple venom peptides that act coordinately to achieve a particular physiological endpoint are referred to as "conopeptides cabals"  <cit> . the fish-hunting cone snails generally have both a "lightning-strike cabal" and a "motor cabal" leading to the tetanic immobilization and neuromuscular block, respectively. a video of conus bullatus has documented the most rapid tetanic immobilization of prey observed for any fish-hunting cone snail. .

venom studies in conus bullatus have already yielded results of exceptional pharmacological interest. the best characterized bullatus venom component, alpha-conotoxin buia is a small peptide antagonist of nicotinic receptors that has become the standard pharmacological tool for differentiating between nicotinic receptors that carry two closely related subunits, β <dig> and β <dig>  these receptors are of considerable interest in parkinson's disease  <cit> . more recently, the μ-conotoxins, peptides with  <dig> disulfide bonds that are antagonists of voltage-gated na channels have also been characterized from conus bullatus  <cit> . these peptides appear to have novel subtype selectivity for the different molecular isoforms of voltage-gated na channels  <cit> . thus, they provide a promising neuropharmacological lead to developing an entirely new pathway to differentiate between different voltage-gated na channel subtypes. clearly, better cone snail genomics resources would aid these studies; however, few such resources exist as yet for conus studies, and none for c. bullatus.

the cone snails are being extensively investigated as a source of peptidic pharmacological agents  with exquisite specificity for different subtypes of receptors in the central nervous system. in keeping with this main goal it is not surprising that most of the available nucleic acid sequences from conus are a catalogue of these compounds present in the venom. in addition, partial sequences of a few mitochondrial  and nuclear genes  <cit>  have also been determined to ascertain the phylogenetic relationship among cone snails.

previous work has used traditional molecular biology approaches to clone genes encoding members of specific conopeptide super-families  <cit> , and est sequencing in another conus snail has identified conopeptides  <cit> . however, to date, no high-throughput sequencing approach on the whole mrna reservoir of a conus venom-duct has been attempted.

we have used rna-seq  <cit>  to identify and profile the expression of conopeptides and post-translational modification enzymes implicated in venom production. our results provide the first global view of venom-duct transcription. our shotgun genomic survey complements our rna-seq data, and is also the first reported for a cone snail. knowledge of several marine gastropod genomes will provide a first step toward the molecular understanding of numerous traits unique to these species. accordingly, we have used these data to determine the suitability of the genome for sequencing and assembly with 2nd generation technologies, determining genome-wide base composition, sequence heterozygosity, simple repeat, and mobile element densities within the c. bullatus genome.

as we show, our rna-seq and genomic datasets can be combined to enable analyses not possible with either dataset alone. for example, the transcriptome assembly has allowed us to explicitly test the hypothesis that conopeptides are under diversifying selection  <cit> . we have also developed a novel method for estimating genome size using rna-seq and genomic shotgun sequences, which we present here. the approach is accurate, and should prove useful for any researcher seeking to determine the size of an emerging model organism  <cit>  genome using 2nd generation sequencing data.

RESULTS
sequence datasets
we generated  <dig> , <dig> illumina paired 59-mers and  <dig> , <dig> paired 60-mers for the genome. the average insert size of the paired-end library is 200nt. we also isolated venom-duct poly-a mrna and sequenced it using both illumina and roche technologies. on the illumina platform, we generated  <dig> , <dig> paired 79-mers with a median insert size of 340bp. the roche  <dig> platform generated  <dig>  reads with average read length of 248bp. many cdna reads from the illumina platform have low-quality 3' ends, which could be due to either to the small amounts of mrna used in our experiments, or instrument error during sequencing or processing. we removed 3'end sequences from the reads with phred quality values of  <dig> 

genome-wide gc content
we randomly selected  <dig> million genomic reads using the process described in the methods section  and determined their gc content. this procedure gives an estimated gc content for the c. bullatus genome of  <dig> %. to validate this method, we also simulated  <dig> million randomly sampled 60-mers from the d. melanogaster genome and performed the same experiment, which gives  <dig> %, an estimate in good agreement with the actual gc content  of the d. melanogaster genome.

genome-wide repeat content
we took three approaches to characterize the repeat content of the c. bullatus genome. first, we ran repeatmasker on  <dig> million randomly selected c. bullatus genomic reads, comparing the results to a matched human, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, and aplysia californica  datasets of simulated reads, as well as real human genome reads <cit>  ; these datasets match the conus data precisely as regards number of reads, distance between pairs, read lengths, and  base quality . comparisons of the simulated human reads to real human reads , indicates that the simulated human reads closely match the real reads as regards repeat content for all repeat classes except simple repeats. we speculate that this is because many simple repeats  are designated as "n" in the reference human genome; hence, a random sampling of segments of the human reference assembly under represents its simple repeat content.

repeatmasker  <cit>  and repbase  <cit>  lack extensive libraries of repeats for mollusks, which will compromise the ability of repeatmasker to identify interspersed repeats in the two mollusk datasets. although, this fact does not complicate direct comparison of c. bullatus and aplysia californica, with regards to the relative numbers of conserved interspersed repeats, it does complicate absolute measurements and comparisons to the other genomes . the ability of repeatmasker to identify simple repeats, however, is less impacted by the lack of well-characterized repeat libraries for mollusks. this fact together with comparison with j. flatley's genomic reads  <cit>  suggests that c. bullatus is significantly enriched for simple repeats relative to the other invertebrates, and slightly so  compared to human.

we also used recon  <cit>  to identify novel, high-copy genomic sequences that may be interspersed repeats in the c. bullatus genome. for this analysis we used our c. bullatus de novo genomic assembly . in total, we found  <dig> genomic contigs present in  <dig> or more copies, with an average length of 544bp. among these genomic sequences,  <dig> are homologous with known line members that were not detected by repeatmasker in first repeat analysis. of the remaining contigs,  <dig> have significant homology with g-protein receptors;  <dig> have significant homology with lipoprotein receptors;  <dig> has a leucine-rich repeat structure. these are probably high-copy number genomic regions but are not interspersed repeats. the remaining contigs have little homology with known interspersed repeats, however, a significant fraction of them have either strong homology to nuclease proteins or weak homology with rrna and trna genes-both common motifs in line elements. running repclass  <cit>  over these  <dig> genomic contigs confirmed that  <dig> contigs have line-like structures or are significantly homologous to known lines. including this set would increase the percentage of the c. bullatus genome with line homology from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

because novel forms of retro-transposons might not have been identified in our repeatmasker experiment, or some unknown bias in the abyss  <cit>  assembler might have caused us to underestimate the numbers of novel repeats identified with recon, we devised a third experiment, that controls for both of these possibilities. in this experiment, we took the same read-datasets used in our repeatmasker analysis , and performed an all-against-all blast  <cit>  search of the c. bullatus reads against themselves, and repeated the same experiment for a matched set of simulated reads from h. sapiens . for reasons of computational complexity we choose to limit this analysis to only one target genome: h. sapiens, because it is the most repeat rich of any in our dataset and its genome is nearly the same size as the c. bullatus genome. we then tallied the percentage of reads having one blast hit, two hits and so on. for each read, its number of hits can be used to obtain an estimate of the copy-number of its sequence within the genome . this allows us to estimate the proportion of high-copy number genomic sequences within the conus genome and to make comparisons to the human genome . this experiment presumes no prior knowledge of the repeat content of the genome. we also used the 'seg' option with wu-blast  <cit>  to exclude hits between reads consisting only of low complexity and/or simple sequence repeats. by using blast with the seg option any reads consisting entirely of low complexity or simple sequence repeats will have no hits.

this analysis reveals much about the repeat content of conus compared to that of the human genome. first, the conus genome has a larger proportion of high copy-number sequences  compared to human. this is shown by the fact that 23% of conus reads  have numbers greater than  <dig>  by looking into this group of human reads, we confirmed that 91% of these are homologous to known interspersed repeats. second, the human dataset  has 3× as many genomic sequences with a copy number above  <dig>  compared to conus . these sequences are mostly non-ltr elements that exists in extremely high copy number; running repeatmasker over these human genome reads showed that 75% of these genomic regions are sines and another 20% are lines, supporting this hypothesis. taken together, our results show that although the conus genome is enriched for interspersed repeats compared to human, it has far fewer non-ltr repetitive elements.

a partial genome assembly
a previous estimate based upon cytology, placed the conus bullatus genome at around  <dig> billion base pairs  <cit> . if true, our  <dig> bp paired-end illumina dataset would provide 3× coverage. although this is insufficient to produce anything near a complete genome assembly, a partial genome assembly is still desirable for some analyses. we used abyss to produce a partial assembly  <dig> million base pairs in length with an n <dig> value of  <dig> bp . this accounts for ~7% of the total length of the c. bullatus genome. to estimate the quality of our genome assembly, we simulated  <dig>  million 60bp-long illumina reads from the d. melanogaster genome , with the same base-calling accuracy distribution as in our conus genomic reads. to do so we used the procedure described in the methods section. this process gives 3× coverage over the drosophila genome with the same error rates as our c. bullatus reads. assembling these reads with abyss with the same parameters produced a drosophila assembly with an n <dig> of  <dig> bp and total sequence length of  <dig> mb, which accounts for roughly 10% of the fly genome. thus the two assemblies are of comparable quality.

assembly of the venom-duct transcriptome
we assembled our illumina rna-seq reads from the c. bullatus venom-duct with abyss . this produced  <dig>  contigs of 60bp or greater in length and having a total length of  <dig> mb. we chose 60bp as minimum contig size because conopeptides can be as short as  <dig> amino acids. the  <dig> reads were generated and assembled by roche.

annotation of transcriptome
to determine the percentage of the total c. bullatus proteome sampled one or more times in our illumina and roche transcriptome datasets, we took the core eukaryotic protein set from cegma  <cit> , which is comprised of  <dig> core proteins that generally lack paralogs in the eukaryotes  <cit> , and asked what percentage of these proteins are found in the combined illumina or roche assemblies. using blastx,  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins  are found .

to annotate the transcriptome assembly we ran wu-blastx on the abyss illumina assembly against uniprotkb database  <cit> .  <dig>  unique uniprotkb proteins have significant homology with one or more transcriptome contigs. we also mapped those contigs no shorter than 200bp to go  <cit>  terms for biological process, molecular function and cellular component. as a control, we applied the same approach to the annotated c. elegans, d. melanogaster and h. sapiens transcriptomes and compared the proportion of genes assigned to each go term in these organisms to our transcriptome assembly results . note that is not a comparison of expression levels, but rather a comparison using go of which genes were represented in our transcriptome assembly. in other words, the relative proportions of all go gene categories associated with our c. bullatus contigs was found to be similar to the relative proportions of genes assigned to the same go categories for c. elegans, d. melanogaster and h. sapiens transcriptomes. we found that the resulting go profiles are highly similar for all four organisms. this finding, together with our observation that 85% of cegma proteins are represented in the assembly, suggests that we have sampled a wide swath of the c. bullatus transcriptome.

identification of conopeptides in rna-seq data
we searched our combined illumina and roche transcriptome assemblies for significant homology to a set of known conopeptides collected from conoserver  <cit> , using the procedure described in the methods section. we find that, as might be expected, conopeptides are transcribed at high levels in the venom duct; the depth of coverage of the putative conopeptides is 102× versus 33× for the remainder of the transcriptome.

whenever possible, we assigned each of our putative conopeptide contigs to a conopeptide superfamily, by significant homology to signal sequences that are characteristic of each superfamily . in total, we were able to assign  <dig> contigs a unique conopeptide super-family. we find that, as in most conus species examined so far, the o <dig>  m, a and t superfamilies were represented by the greatest number of distinct contigs. we also observed that mrna abundance levels followed this same general pattern with respect to superfamilies . besides these well represented superfamilies, we also found small number of conopeptides belonging to the rarer in i <dig> and j conopeptide super-families in conus bullatus, which account for ~ <dig> % of total putative-conopeptide transcripts.

percentages for c. bullatus refer to percentage of venom-duct rna-seq reads belonging to a given superfamily. globally the distribution parallels that for reference conopeptide sequences by class available on conserver, although rare classes are under-sampled.

in total, we identified  <dig>  putative conopeptide contigs. most of these contigs are short , and do not contain the full-length sequence of the conopeptide precursor. nevertheless, we were able to identify a few complete conopeptides , and a selection of  <dig> putative complete and partial conopeptide sequences are presented in . the conopeptides listed belong to the o, m, a, j, contryphan and conkunitzin super-families with o- being the most abundant. while conopeptides belonging to the i <dig>  t, con-ikot-ikot, and conantokin super-families could be identified in the blast analysis; the contig lengths and frameshifts associated these hits precluded the generation of a high confidence protein sequence.

cysteine motifs are shown next to the superfamilies. the underlined residues indicate presumed propeptide cleavage site ascertained by analogy to previously isolated toxins; * indicate probable amidation at the c-terminal residue after cleavage of the following g residue. in the case of  <dig> , <dig>  where the propeptide cleavage site is uncertain, we have indicated the cleavage site at the basic residues  proximal to the presumed toxin sequence. the peptides bu  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been previously characterized.

a notable feature of the conus bullatus transcriptome analysis is the breadth of a-superfamily peptides expressed in the venom duct, which are unprecedented in their structural diversity . in most conus species, the predominant structural classes of a-peptides is the α4/ <dig> subfamily; in fish-hunting cone snails, additional subclasses are the α3/ <dig> subfamily and κa conotoxins  and the αa conotoxins . the conus bullatus transcriptome includes an mrna encoding a κa conotoxin , which is unambiguous in its identity. there is also a single member of the α4/ <dig> subfamily  of unknown function, which is strikingly different in sequence from all other conus venom peptides in this group. although no member of the αa family or the α3/ <dig> subfamilies were found,  <dig> other a superfamily peptides were identified. together these comprise a greater range of structural diversity in the a-superfamily than has been found in any other venom. three subclasses of α-conotoxins represented two different α4/ <dig> peptides , one α4/ <dig> peptide  and one α4/ <dig> peptide . unique to c. bullatus are the four a peptides with  <dig> disulfide bonds  which are divergent from both κa and αa families. it is notable that although these comprise a significant fraction of the total complement of a-superfamily peptides in c. bullatus, similar peptides have not been reported from any other species thus far. thus, it appears that conus bullatus, and potentially the textilia clade of conus species, has explored novel evolutionary pathways in generating their complement of a-gene superfamily peptides.

*c-terminal is amidated. we have assumed that the proteolytic cleavage site is at the basic residue proximal to the presumed toxin sequence.

snp rates in conopeptides
we also compared the single nucleotide heterozygosity level within the transcripts encoding conopeptides to the rest of the transcriptome. to reduce false negative rates, we restricted our analysis to transcriptome contigs having coverage depths of 10× or more. our rationale being that snps within low-coverage contigs might be missed, leading us to underestimate the actual snp rate. for the transcriptome as a whole, the snp rate is  <dig>  . by contrast, the single nucleotide polymorphism rate within conotoxin contigs is  <dig>  . the  <dig> -fold higher snp rate within conopeptides contigs is consistent with the hypothesis that conopeptides are under diversifying selection.

candidate post-translational processing enzymes
conopeptides contain post-translationally modified amino acids. these modifications play an important role in conferring target specificity. the most ubiquitous modification is the formation of disulfides leading to proper conotoxin folding; this mediated by disulfide isomerases, chaperones and enzymes involved in redox biochemistry. from an examination of transcriptome sequences we have identified partial and complete sequences of several chaperones and thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that are likely to be involved in the redox biochemistry of conotoxin folding .

we identified some of the enzymes that are presumed to catalyze correct disulfide connectivity within conopeptides  <cit> . these include members of the qsox family of sulfhydryl oxidases, ero oxidases and protein disulfide isomerases . pdis also have chaperone-like activity and prevent protein aggregation. we have identified three isoforms of protein disulfide isomerase  and four members belonging to different subfamilies of pdis. two of these are members of the p <dig> subfamily. we also identified a transcript related to human pdirs, which carry out oxidation-isomerization functions similar to pdi, but are less active. we also identified a transcript encoding a second redox inactive trx domain b' belong to ep <dig> and ep <dig> subfamily. in addition, transcriptome contigs with homology to several chaperones, including 78kda glucose regulated protein, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  glucose regulated protein  <dig>  different subunits of the t-complex protein  <dig>  dna j , calnexin, calreticulin, chaperonin 10kda subunit, prefoldin superfamily and activator of hsp <dig> atpase i were also identified.

the other enzymes we have identified include a proline hydroxylase related to the enzyme involved in collagen biosynthesis. . we have identified both fk <dig> binding protein type peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase and the cyclophilin peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase. the latter type has been shown to enhance the rate of correct folding of conopeptides containing proline residues  <cit> . other enzymes identified include lysyl hydroxylase, vitamin k dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase  <cit> , vitamin k epoxide reductase and peptidyl glycine alpha amidating monooxygenase.

a large number of hormones and neuro-active peptides require c-terminal amidation for full activity  <cit> ; conopeptides are no exception. c-terminal amidation is a two-step process. peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase  catalyzes the hydroxylation of the α-carbon of glycine and a second enzyme, peptidyl-α-hydroxy glycine α-amidating lyase  catalyzes the formation of the amidated product and glyoxylate. in drosophila these two activities are carried out by separate polypeptides, whereas in other organisms  a single polypeptide carries out both activities. we discovered a single transcriptome contig encoding both phm and pal domains, thus c-terminal amidation of conopeptides is likely carried out by a single enzyme in c. bullatus.

a unique posttranslational modification first identified in conus was the presence of 6-br tryptophan in conopeptides, e.g. bromocontryphan  <cit> , bromosleeper  <cit>  and light sleeper  <cit> . subsequently the modification was also characterized in a peptide isolated from mammalian brain  <cit> . the enzyme responsible for this modification has not been characterized. however, four different classes of haloperoxidases are known  <cit> , which are enzymes that use heme iron/h2o <dig>  vanadium/h2o <dig>  fadh2/o <dig>  and non-heme iron/o2/α-ketoglutarate. in the present analyses we have not identified any of the above classes of enzymes.

another posttranslational modification is the isomerization of l-amino acids in peptides to the d-conformation  <cit> . the enzyme has been isolated from the funnel web spider venom  <cit> . at present we have not identified any transcript possibly encoding the isomerase.

a novel method for estimating genome size
we have developed a novel method for determining genome size, using 2nd generation genomic and rna-seq reads . for proof of principle, we first estimated the genome size of d. melanogaster. to do so, we simulated  <dig> , <dig> 59bp genomic reads for the fly-genome, and blasted the annotated fly transcriptome against the simulated reads . the depth of coverage peak is at  <dig>  . thus, the estimated genome size for d. melanogaster is  <dig> ,253*59/ <dig>  =  <dig>  mb. compared to the current size of fly genome , the error is  <dig> %. we also estimated the genome size of c. elegans. this time we randomly sheared the annotated transcriptome of c. elegans into short contigs with the same n <dig> as our c. bullatus transcriptome assembly, and randomly selected a 57mb subset of these contigs. we did this to simulate the fragmented nature of our de novo transcriptome assembly. we also simulated  <dig> , <dig> genomic c. elegans reads, and blasted them to the subset of simulated c. elegans transcriptome. as shown in figure  <dig> , the peak depth of coverage for the transcriptome is  <dig> ×. we repeated this experiment three times; there was no variance in this value. this gives us an estimate of genome size of  <dig> mb, which is  <dig> % higher than estimated genome size , again a good fit to the published genome size. for conus bullatus, the estimated coverage depth is  <dig> × from  <dig> gb of sequence reads, thus the best estimate for the size of the conus bullatus genome is  <dig>  gb.

discussion
2nd generation sequencing technologies now make it possible to probe new and emerging model organism genomes in a cost effective manner. this means that genomes and transcriptomes can be rapidly trawled for specific contents, and at the same time the organism can be evaluated for suitability of whole-genome de novo assembly. we have tried to accomplish both these tasks in the work reported here.

our transcriptome analyses provide the first global view of gene expression within a conus venom-duct. several lines of evidence suggest that our dataset provides a relatively comprehensive view of this pharmacologically important tissue. first, the relative proportion of c. bullatus genes  assigned to different go terms resemble those of other well annotated transcriptomes. second, 85% of cegma's universally conserved eukaryotic genes are represented by one or more contigs, providing an independent estimate of the degree of completeness of the assembly. one caveat to this conclusion is that highly expressed basic house keeping genes are over represented in the cegma set; thus a more precise statement is that 85% of highly expressed genes are present in the rna-seq data.

our rna-seq data are highly enriched for reads with conopeptide homology. the average read depth of contigs homologous to conopeptides is 102× as opposed to 33x for the remaining contigs. interestingly, their super-family frequency spectrum roughly approximates that of the conoserver reference collection in general  <cit> , although some rare classes are missing.

overall, the distribution and frequencies of go functions, processes and locations of annotated transcriptome data closely parallel those of various carefully annotated model organism transcriptomes ; this fact suggests that overall, the venom-duct transcriptome is diverse, despite the highly specialized nature of this tissue. although, as our recovery of numerous conopeptides and post-translational modification -enzymes makes clear, its transcription is also clearly geared toward venom production. our success at characterizing the conopeptide and candidate ptm-enzymes demonstrates the power of the rna-seq approach for conopeptide discovery. the conopeptide and ptm-enzymes we have discovered present new avenues for future research, as it is now possible to express these proteins in heterologous cells in order to explore interactions ptm-enzymes and their conopeptide targets  <cit> .

our genomic shotgun survey data have allowed us to characterize the c. bullatus genome. our analyses indicate that it is enriched for simple repeats relative to the human genome. characterization of its interspersed repeat populations is complicated by the lack of an adequate repeat library for repeatmasker. to circumvent this obstacle, we developed a novel analysis method, comparing the inter-read similarity frequency spectrum of our c. bullatus genome reads to the inter-read similarity frequency spectrum of matched human dataset. based upon this analysis we conclude that c. bullatus has higher repeat content, yet contains fewer extremely high-copy repeat species. because this method requires no assembly or prior knowledge of a genome's repeat content, it should prove useful to others seeking to characterize the repeat contents of new and emerging model genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have carried out the first transcriptome and genomic survey of a textilian, conus bullatus. our rna-seq analyses provide the first global view of transcription within a conus venom duct, and demonstrate the feasibility of trawling these data for rapid discovery of new conopeptides and ptm-enzymes. we find that numerous a-superfamily peptides are expressed in the venom duct. these conopeptides are unprecedented in their structural diversity, suggesting that conus bullatus, and potentially the textilia clade in general, has explored novel evolutionary pathways in generating its complement of a-gene super-family peptides. our data also provide support for the long-standing hypothesis that conopeptides are under diversifying selection. our genomic analyses have revealed that the c. bullatus genome has higher content of interspersed repeats, yet fewer extremely high-copy-number repeats compared to human.
