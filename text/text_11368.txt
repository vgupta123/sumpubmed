BACKGROUND
sigma subunits of bacterial rna polymerase regulate the process of transcriptional initiation through binding to rna polymerase holoenzyme, recognition of promoter sequences, and promotion of open complex formation. one of the sigma factors, called alternative sigma factor σ <dig>  significantly differs from all other known sigma factor proteins in two respects . first, it recognizes and binds characteristic promoters with gg − <dig> and tgc − <dig> elements that are more conserved than the promoters of σ <dig> family. second, σ <dig> strictly requires the atp hydrolysis activity of an activating transcription factor  for the formation of open promoter complex. tfs necessary for such activation are called prokaryotic enhancer-binding proteins   <cit> . ebps specifically bind a conserved upstream activating sequence  that contains one or several tf binding sites. uass are located 100 bp or more upstream from the σ54-dependent promoter, and the interaction of σ54-polymerase complex with ebp oligomer requires dna looping between the uas and promoter. this looping is often facilitated by bacterial chromatin proteins like integration host factor or histone-like protein hu. thus, initiation of σ54-dependent transcription involves promoter binding by σ54-containing rna polymerase, uas binding by ebp, and activation of σ54-polymerase by atp hydrolysis with subsequent formation of an open complex.

the analysis of taxonomic diversity of rpon  and ebp-encoding genes demonstrated their presence in about 60 % of bacterial genomes  <cit> . σ <dig> seems to be an essential protein in some deltaproteobacteria, since attempts to produce viable rpon deletion mutants of myxococcus xanthus  <cit>  and geobacter sulfurreducens  <cit>  were unsuccessful.

σ54-dependent regulons  have been extensively studied in several model organisms. it was found that in escherichia coli, the σ <dig> sigmulon includes about  <dig> operons , and  <dig> of them are involved in nitrogen metabolism. the products of other σ54-dependent operons contribute to formate, propionate and acetolactate metabolism, zinc tolerance, phage shock response and other functions. most of e. coli ebps control one or few operons, and only ntrc regulon includes  <dig> operons. however, in other model organisms ebps may control a larger number of promoters. for example, nifa in rhizobium etli regulates  <dig> operons involved in nitrogen fixation, energy production, transport, secondary metabolism and other diverse functions  <cit> . in pseudomonas putida, there are  <dig> ebp-encoding genes and most of them are located close to σ54-dependent operons  <cit> . of  <dig> σ54-dependent promoters in p. putida,  <dig> are related to nitrogen and carbon metabolism, flagella and motility. a much larger σ54-dependent sigmulon  was described in geobacter sulfurreducens  <cit> . in this bacterium, σ54-dependent genes are involved in nitrogen assimilation, formate and amino acid metabolism, c4-dicarboxylate transport, flagella and pili biogenesis and other functions. nevertheless, some bacteria have very small σ <dig> sigmulons. for example, lactobacillus plantarum has only one ebp that activates a single σ54-dependent promoter upstream of mannose transport operon  <cit> .

as σ54-dependent transcription requires ebp for initiation, the range of functions regulated by σ <dig> directly depends on the assortment of ebps in the bacterium. a search within the microbesonline database demonstrates the presence of ebps in  <dig> bacterial species  <cit> . aerobic deltaproteobacteria with large genomes have the highest total number of ebps . a high number of ebps in myxococcus xanthus and related bacteria can be explained not only by their genome size, but also by wide involvement of these regulators in the very complex fruiting body development program  <cit> . however, the highest relative number of ebps  was observed in anaerobic deltaproteobacteria, isolated from soil and aquatic habitats. desulfovibrio vulgaris strains are in the third place on the list after desulfomonile tiedjei and desulfomicrobium baculatum.fig.  <dig> the number of ebps in the bacterial genomes of different sizes. grey circles represent anaerobic deltaproteobacteria, and black diamonds represent aerobic deltaproteobacteria. d. vulgaris hildenborough marked by a black ring. grey triangles represent other bacterial genomes



one of these strains, desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough, a model bacterium for sulfate reduction studies, has  <dig> genes encoding putative σ54-associated ebps  <cit> . among these, both target genes and tf binding motifs are known for  <dig> ebps  <cit> , and only the target genes for  <dig> more ebps  <cit> . putative σ54-dependent promoters were predicted computationally upstream of many ebp target operons  <cit> . a genome-wide analysis of d. vulgaris hildenborough transcriptome  <cit>  has identified  <dig> σ54-dependent promoters by a combination of 5′-rna-seq and computational analysis of promoter motifs.

despite the existing data on σ54-dependent transcription in d. vulgaris hildenborough, we still do not have a complete understanding of the role of the σ54-dependent regulome  in this bacterium. for most of σ54-dependent promoters, we do not know ebps that activate them. we also do not know binding motifs and target genes for multiple ebps. thus, the goal of the current study was to comprehensively reconstruct the σ54-dependent regulome in d. vulgaris hildenborough genome-wide. we inferred several σ54-dependent regulons not known before . this allowed us to make important conclusions about the set of functions controlled by σ54-associated regulators in d. vulgaris hildenborough and related deltaproteobacteria.

RESULTS
in order to characterize a particular type of transcriptional regulation in bacteria, one needs to elucidate all the necessary components in this process, which typically are: transcriptional regulator, its binding sites, and a set of regulated genes or operons. in our study we aimed at discovering the compendium of regulatory elements that facilitate σ54-dependent transcription, i.e., σ54-dependent regulome. this regulome consists of all σ54-dependent transcriptional activators , ebp binding sites and ebp-regulated operons with σ54-dependent promoters. we started with the computational analysis of all predicted d. vulgaris hildenborough ebps to verify the presence of dna-binding domain and σ54-interacting domain. next, we reconstructed ebp binding motifs  and identified ebp binding sites in the d. vulgaris hildenborough genome. finally, we compared ebp regulons with the σ54-dependent sigmulon and identified a set of operons co-regulated by ebps and σ <dig> subunit.

the repertoire of σ54-dependent regulators in d. vulgaris hildenborough
all σ54-dependent ebps possess a central aaa+ domain responsible for atp binding and hydrolysis, oligomerization and interaction with σ <dig> subunit  <cit> . a common feature of σ54-dependent ebps is the peptide motif ‘gaftga’, a structural element of aaa+ domain that interacts with sigma subunit protein  <cit> . we checked the presence of this motif in  <dig> ebps from d. vulgaris hildenborough by comparing them with aaa+ domain model from pfam database . an exact gaftga sequence was observed in  <dig> of  <dig> ebps, while in the other  <dig> ebps this motif has different substitutions . ten of these  <dig> ebps possess eight variations of the motif  that would maintain the ebp’s ability to activate transcription  <cit> . the remaining two ebps  have substitutions in the gaftga motif that might interfere with its ability to bind σ <dig> protein. dvua <dig> possesses three substitutions , but our regulon prediction results  suggest that they do not prevent dvua <dig> from activating σ54-dependent promoters. the second protein, dvu <dig>  has only one substitution of highly conserved threonine for proline . although an earlier work  <cit>  reported a single amino acid deletion in the gafpga motif of dvu <dig>  our comparison with the aaa+ domain model does not confirm the deletion. nevertheless, the functionality of dvu <dig> as a σ54-dependent activator is unclear, because the same substitution of threonine for proline in another σ54-dependent activator, nifa from bradyrhizobium japonicum, rendered the protein inactive  <cit> .table  <dig> enhancer binding proteins of d. vulgaris hildenborough

operons that do not have σ54-dependent promoters are marked with asterisk



many known ebps have one or two n-terminal domains that modulate transcriptional activation capability of the regulator  <cit> . these domains recognize various environmental signals through phosphorylation or ligand binding. in particular,  <dig> ebps of d. vulgaris hildenborough are response regulators of two-component systems  with a n-terminal response regulator receiver domain  that mediates phosphotransfer from a sensor histidine kinase. the other  <dig> ebps are one-component regulatory systems  containing both input and output domains in a single protein, and lacking histidine kinase and response regulator domains. the two most common sensing domains of ocss are gaf   <cit>  and pas domains   <cit> . one of the response regulator proteins, dvu <dig>  also has a pas domain, which is suggestive of signal integration or dual activation. besides pas and gaf domains, we observed two ocss with long conserved n-terminal regions that may encompass unknown sensing domains . finally,  <dig> out of the  <dig> ebps  lack n-terminal domains suggesting either an interaction with a partner protein that affects the regulatory activity of the ebp, or participation of these proteins in a regulatory cascade. such interactions have been described in other species, for example, pspa protein negatively regulating pspf transcription factor  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of d. vulgaris hildenborough ebps based on dna-binding domains. dvu <dig> protein was omitted from this tree because it has a different dna-binding domain sequence. domain architecture and tf binding motifs are shown for each protein, where available. dvu <dig> and dvu <dig> ebps share a common binding motif . groups of similar motifs identified by tomtom comparison are displayed



the vast majority of known ebps have a dna-binding domain that is located at the c-terminus of the protein  <cit> . in all d. vulgaris hildenborough ebps but one, there are annotated fis-type hth motifs , which are typical for σ54-dependent regulators  <cit> . the only exception is dvu <dig> that does not have an annotated c-terminal dna-binding domain and thus is not included in the phylogenetic tree constructed by dna-binding domains .

our examination of dvu <dig> and its orthologs from other desulfovibrionales revealed that some of them  have matches to the winged helix dna-binding domain model  from the superfamily database  <cit> , thus it is likely that dvu <dig> orthologs have dna-binding activity. multiple sequence alignment of these proteins demonstrates the presence of strong sequence conservation at the location of the ssf <dig> domain across all proteins, including dvu <dig> . this similarity further suggests that dvu <dig> is a dna-binding regulatory protein indeed. thus, we predict that all  <dig> σ54-dependent regulators from d. vulgaris hildenborough bind dna in a sequence-specific manner, similar to a vast majority of other bacterial ebps  <cit> .

reconstructed tf binding motifs for σ54-dependent regulators in d. vulgaris hildenborough
in order to find the genes and operons that compose the regulon of each ebp, we reconstructed tf binding motifs for all these regulators and used those motifs in comparative genomics analysis. as the first step in motif reconstruction, we identified orthologs of all  <dig> d. vulgaris hildenborough ebps in nine species of desulfovibrionales, as described in methods. the number of ebps in these genomes varies significantly, from  <dig> in lawsonia intracellularis to  <dig> in desulfomicrobium baculatum . as expected, d. vulgaris miyazaki, the closest relative of d. vulgaris hildenborough, has  <dig> ebps conserved between these two species, the highest number among the studied genomes. a little more distant l. intracellularis, d. desulfuricans and d. piger  have strikingly lower numbers of ebp orthologs , due to a lower number of ebps in these genomes in general. the number of ebp orthologs in the more distant desulfovibrionales species gradually decrease from  <dig> in desulfovibrio alaskensis g <dig> to  <dig> in desulfohalobium retbaensae, with increase of phylogenetic distance from d. vulgaris hildenborough . there is no significant difference between conservation of tcs response regulators and that of one-component ebps.fig.  <dig> phylogeny of desulfovibrionales and conservation of d. vulgaris hildenborough ebps in closely related genomes. one-component ebps from d. vulgaris hildenborough and their orthologs are marked grey, σ54-dependent response regulators of tcss from d. vulgaris hildenborough and their orthologs are marked black, other ebps  are marked white. phylogenetic tree of desulfovibrionales was extracted from the microbesonline species tree  <cit> , ebp orthologs were calculated as described in methods section



it is interesting that dvua <dig> protein lacks any n-terminal signal domain but all its orthologs have response regulator receiver domain. we determined that dvua <dig> protein, encoded by a gene immediately upstream of dvua <dig>  is an ortholog of this domain. in addition, dvua <dig> protein lacks eight n-terminal amino acids in the aaa+ domain interacting with σ <dig> subunit. by comparing the nucleotide sequences of the closely related d. vulgaris strains hildenborough, dp <dig> and rch <dig>  we identified a single-nucleotide deletion in the genome of hildenborough strain . this deletion leads to the premature termination of dvua <dig> protein synthesis within the σ54-interacting domain. as d. vulgaris hildenborough is unable to synthesize the complete functional protein, we excluded dvua <dig> from subsequent regulon analysis. nevertheless, it is possible that this protein retains some transcriptional activity.

our analysis of ebp conservation in desulfovibrionales demonstrated a good potential for comparative reconstruction of regulons. previous studies of ebps in d. vulgaris hildenborough  <cit>  identified binding sites for  <dig> ebps. in this work, we reconstructed tf binding motifs for  <dig> other ebps . briefly, we used comparative reconstruction of σ54-dependent promoters in combination with regulator conservation results and existing dap-chip data for several regulators  <cit> . in many cases, we found ebp-encoding genes to be co-localized with the regulated σ54-dependent promoters, and this co-localization was conserved within the desulfovibrionales order. in most cases, such co-localization allowed the identification of a single regulatory gene. only in one case, two regulatory genes, dvu <dig> and dvu <dig>  are co-localized with the same σ54-dependent promoter in several genomes. using purified proteins, we tested both candidate regulators in vitro for their ability to bind predicted sites, and found that only dvu <dig> shows binding .fig.  <dig> transcriptional regulator dvu <dig>  and not dvu <dig>  binds upstream of target gene dvu <dig>  lanes 1– <dig> show electrophoretic mobility shift assays with full-length  upstream region of dvu2957: lane  <dig> – dna only; lanes  <dig> and  <dig> – with purified dvu <dig> protein ; lanes  <dig> and  <dig> – with purified dvu <dig> protein . lanes 6– <dig> show emsas with predicted binding site motif upstream of dvu <dig> . sequences of the two sites are shown below the gel image; the three conserved half-sites are shown in caps, and substitutions made in the mutated site are shown in red. lanes  <dig>   <dig> – dna only; lanes  <dig>   <dig> – with  <dig> pmol of dvu <dig> protein; lanes  <dig>   <dig> – with  <dig> pmol of dvu <dig> protein



all the identified tf binding motifs were compared by tomtom  <cit> , since similarity of motifs could suggest a cross-regulation between different ebps. all-against-all comparison of  <dig> ebp binding motifs found similarity in only  <dig> motifs that could be grouped into five based on similarity . in three of these groups, motifs consist of half sites tgt and aca separated by  <dig>   <dig> or 12 bp. it is interesting that similarity of tf binding motifs do not always reflect similarity of dna-binding domains, as demonstrated by a comparison of the groups of motifs with a phylogenetic tree based on dna-binding domains . nearly half of the motifs  did not show similarity to any other motif.

using the collection of these ebp binding motifs, we reconstructed or confirmed regulons of  <dig> ebps by a whole-genome comparative analysis . for one additional ebp, dvu <dig>  we had no predicted motif, thus its regulated genes were deduced from experimental results  <cit> . for the majority of σ54-dependent regulators, the regulons consist of just one to four regulated operons . only dvua <dig>  dvu <dig> and dvu <dig> regulators have larger regulons with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> operons, respectively.fig.  <dig> distribution of sizes of ebp regulons



functional diversity of σ54-dependent genes in d. vulgaris hildenborough
we identified the content of σ <dig> sigmulon and  <dig> ebp regulons in d. vulgaris hildenborough by a combination of computational and experimental data analysis . we found  <dig> σ54-dependent promoters upstream of  <dig> operons that encompass  <dig> genes from different functional groups . the largest functional group  includes genes involved in flagellar assembly and other functions linked to cell exterior: appendages, cell wall, secreted exopolysaccharides and biofilm components. this is in agreement with results of a recent large-scale analysis that demonstrated a connection of σ54-dependent transcription to the make-up of the bacterial exterior  <cit> .table  <dig> summary of functions regulated by σ54-dependent operons. functional assignment of individual operons shown in additional file 5




another large group of operons from σ <dig> sigmulon  is comprised of metabolic and transport genes. a significant part of this group consists of genes of ammonia assimilation, nitrogen fixation and catabolism of amino acids and amides. other genes in this group are involved in the metabolism of carboxylic acids, which are important carbon and energy sources for d. vulgaris and related species. σ54-dependent regulation of nitrogen metabolism, as well as the regulation of energy production, has been described in various taxonomic groups of bacteria . however, σ54-dependent transcription of pyruvate and lactate metabolism genes have not been described in any other taxa. nine operons in this group encode transporters from tsup  or pse  families. there is no data on substrate specificity of these transporting systems, but two of the pse family transporters have been shown to be co-regulated with lactate metabolism genes  <cit> .

of the remaining  <dig> operons in σ <dig> sigmulon,  <dig> are involved in regulation,  <dig> in stress response,  <dig> in cell division and  <dig> have no assigned function. regulatory rnas and coding genes with σ54-dependent promoters are involved in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, thus suggesting an existence of regulatory cascades possibly integrating different extracellular and/or intracellular signals. for some of the functions listed, transcriptional control by σ <dig> and ebps has been shown in deltaproteobacteria and other taxonomic groups . the most studied examples of such functions are flagellar assembly and nitrogen metabolism. since the homologous ebps involved in the response to metal stress and phage shock have been documented in very distant bacteria such as e. coli  <cit> , salmonella enterica  <cit>  and yersinia enterocolitica  <cit> , the conservation of these functions in σ54–dependent regulome of d. vulgaris hildenborough emphasizes importance of such systems for bacteria.

in addition to the functions that are commonly regulated by σ <dig> and ebps, we observed several ebp regulons that have not been described in any other bacteria. the four most interesting cases of σ54-dependent regulators for type iii secretion, pyruvate transport metabolism, electron transfer and alanine dehydrogenase are described in detail below.

regulator of type iii secretion genes 
the type iii secretion system  is a large multisubunit complex secreting effector proteins across bacterial membranes  <cit> . in d. vulgaris hildenborough, t3ss components are encoded by two divergent operons with σ54-dependent promoters on the native pdv <dig> plasmid  <cit> , and the gene encoding dvua <dig> ebp that is located in one of these operons. we predicted a putative dvua <dig> binding motif in the common upstream region of these two operons in three desulfovibrio spp. genomes . a whole-genome regulon analysis identified additional regulatory sites upstream of dvu <dig> gene and its orthologs in two other genomes. these genes have predicted σ54-dependent promoters, and their products are annotated as hypothetical proteins. using a computational tool for prediction of effector proteins of type iii secretion system  <cit> , we demonstrated a high probability for dvu <dig> to be a secreted t3ss effector . colocalization of dvu <dig> gene with dvu <dig> gene encoding type iii secretion chaperone on the chromosome supports our functional assignment.

regulators of pyruvate formate-lyases 
pyruvate formate-lyase  catalyzes the reversible nonoxidative dissimilation of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme a and formate  <cit> . d. vulgaris hildenborough genome contains two genes encoding pfls, dvu <dig> and dvu <dig>  <cit> , and both of them are co-transcribed with genes encoding pfl-activating proteins. dvu2824-encoding operon also contains genes for c4-dicarboxylate transporting system, dvu <dig> and dvu <dig> . we observed that orthologs of two ebp-encoding genes, dvu <dig> and dvu <dig>  are co-localized with pfl operons in desulfovibrionales genomes, and these operons had conserved σ54-dependent promoters. we predicted that dvu <dig> regulator binds an at-rich palindromic site upstream of the dvu <dig> promoter . dvu <dig> gene demonstrated increased expression during growth on hydrogen and sulfate  <cit> , thus suggesting that the dvu2272-dvu <dig> operon may be involved in pyruvate biosynthesis when acetate and co <dig> are the only carbon sources available.fig.  <dig> dvu <dig>  dvu <dig>  dvu <dig> regulons and their conservation in other desulfovibrionales. ebp-encoding genes are marked black, promoters are shown by arrows, ebp binding sites are shown by diamonds. genes encoding mfs transporters are marked red, genes encoding amydohydrolase family proteins are marked magenta, genes encoding pfl are marked orange, genes encoding pfl-activating enzymes are marked green



we also predicted dvu <dig> binding sites upstream of operons encoding pyruvate-formate lyase dvu <dig> and its orthologs in five desulfovibrionales genomes . these sites probably activate a neighbor gene dvu <dig> encoding amidohydrolase family protein, which also has σ54-dependent promoter. orthologs of dvu <dig> in d. desulfuricans and d. piger  are co-transcribed with genes encoding major facilitator superfamily  transporters. these two genomes lack c4-dicarboxylate transporters encoded by dvu <dig> and dvu <dig> orthologs. search in transporter classification database  identified similar mfs proteins from metabolite:h+ symporter family  that can transport citrate, oxoglutarate, dicarboxylates, acetate and shikimate . these data suggest that mfs transporters ddes_ <dig> and despig_ <dig> may transport c4-dicarboxylates.

regulator of electron transport system 
it was previously demonstrated that octaheme cytochrome complex  transports electrons from a periplasmic octahemic c-type cytochrome ohca to an iron-sulfur membrane protein ohcb and then to a haem b-containing membrane protein ohcc  <cit> . in d. vulgaris hildenborough ohc complex proteins are encoded by ohcbac operon, and one or several ohc genes are present in other desulfovibrio spp. genomes as well  <cit> . we observed that a regulatory gene dvu <dig> and its orthologs are divergently transcribed from the ohc genes in six desulfovibrionales genomes . a comparative analysis identified σ54-dependent promoters upstream of ohc genes, thus we predicted that dvu <dig> ebp is a transcriptional regulator of ohc system. we detected dvu <dig> binding sites upstream of all ohc operons. remarkably, d. alaskensis g <dig> lacks ohca and ohcc genes but the last remaining gene of the ohc system, ohcb, is still regulated by a dvu <dig> ortholog since we found σ54-dependent promoter and dvu <dig> binding site upstream of the ohcb gene .

regulator of alanine dehydrogenase 
l-alanine dehydrogenase  catalyzes the oxidative deamination of l-alanine and the reductive amination of pyruvate. various regulators of alanine dehydrogenase have been characterized in bacillus subtilis , amycolatopsis mediterranei , rhizobium leguminozarum and mycobacterium smegmatis , but no such regulators have been studied in deltaproteobacteria. a gene encoding ald enzyme in d. vulgaris  is located downstream from the regulatory gene dvu <dig> as well as in the six other desulfovibrionales genomes. a conserved regulatory motif  and σ54-dependent promoters were found upstream of ald genes.

evolutionary conservation of σ54-dependent regulome in desulfovibrionales species
to study phylogenetic distribution of the reconstructed σ54-dependent regulons, we performed two-dimensional hierarchical clustering based on the presence/absence of reconstructed regulons among desulfovibrionales genomes . the largest group  is almost exclusively conserved in free-living  bacteria. many regulons controlling metabolism, extracellular structures, non-coding rnas and stress response belong to this group. a group of four d. vulgaris hildenborough regulons is conserved in most species, regardless of their lifestyle. this group includes regulons controlling flagellar genes, stress response and nitrogen metabolism. the third group consists of  <dig> low-conserved regulons that sporadically occur in different genomes.fig.  <dig> two-dimensional hierarchical clustering based on conservation of reconstructed σ54-dependent regulons across desulfovibrionales genomes. free-living bacteria are marked with grey background. pseudogenes of ebps are marked black. species abbreviations used: dvh, desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough; dvm: desulfovibrio vulgaris miyazaki; g20: desulfovibrio alaskensis g20; d. mag: desulfovibrio magneticus; d. bac: desulfomicrobium baculatum; d.sal: desulfovibrio salexigens; d. ret: desulfohalobium retbaensae; 27774: d. desulfuricans 27774; d. pig: desulfovibrio piger; l. i: lawsonia intracellularis




clustering results demonstrate that bacterial species are grouped by their lifestyle rather than by their phylogenetic relatedness . free-living species are clustered separately from animal host-associated species. the variation in the numbers of σ54-dependent regulons among desulfovibrionales species suggest that σ54-dependent regulation may play an important role in the adaptation of free-living species to constantly changing environmental conditions. based on this analysis we speculate that the relative higher abundance of ebps and associated σ54-dependent regulons in free-living deltaproteobacteria is a consequence of their life style. however, neither functional category is strictly limited to free-living bacteria: ebps regulating metabolism and transport and ebps regulating extracellular functions may be ubiquitous or be restricted to free-living bacteria. only regulators of non-coding rnas were found to have a propensity toward free-living species.

co-occurrence of ebp binding sites and σ54-dependent promoters in d. vulgaris hildenborough
our reconstruction of σ54-dependent regulome includes uass upstream of  <dig> operons with σ54-dependent promoters . in addition to these operons, ebp binding sites were found upstream of nine operons that have no σ54-dependent promoters. the biggest fraction of σ54-dependent promoters were found within  <dig> nucleotides from the closest ebp binding site , while in four cases, the promoter was found at more than 300 bp downstream from the cognate uas. further, while ebp binding sites are typically located upstream of the σ54-dependent promoter, a small number of uass were found at a distance of 40–70 bp downstream from the promoters, and most of these were binding sites for the flagellar regulator dvu <dig> fig.  <dig>

for  <dig> operons with σ54-dependent promoters, we could not find predicted uass . these promoters belong to operons from different functional groups, but a majority of them are involved in the composition of the bacterial exterior. in particular, almost half of these operons are predicted to be involved in flagellar biogenesis and motility: five operons encode flagellar components and six operons are co-expressed with flagellar genes . the remaining seven promoters without predicted uass are linked with chemotaxis, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, biofilm formation, cell wall metabolism, pili and type iii secretion. we cannot exclude the possibility that some of these operons may belong to the unidentified dvua <dig> and dvu <dig> regulons. however, they also may be regulated by ebp binding sites located far upstream or downstream from the promoter, beyond the limits of our search or within coding regions. for example, an ntrc-dependent enhancer retains its activity even being positioned up to 15 kb away from σ54-dependent glnap <dig> promoter of e. coli  <cit> . a high conservation of coding regions precludes us from prediction of such enhancers by computational methods, thus further experimental studies of such cases are needed.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we comprehensively characterized the genome-wide σ54-dependent regulome of d. vulgaris hildenborough. the results include: the σ54-dependent ebps , the ebp binding sites , the σ54-dependent promoters  and the σ54-dependent genes and operons .

our results demonstrate that the σ54-dependent regulome controls a wide variety of cellular functions in d. vulgaris hildenborough. we identified regulatory elements that activate σ54-dependent transcription of several dozens of operons. in particular, we inferred several σ54-dependent regulons not known before . many of these elements are conserved between d. vulgaris hildenborough and related sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacteria that makes possible the semi-automated inference of σ54-dependent regulome in newly sequenced deltaproteobacteria by projection of the collection of σ54-dependent regulons reconstructed in this study.
