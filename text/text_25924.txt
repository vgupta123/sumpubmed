BACKGROUND
the quest for susceptibility genes of common complex disorders such as type  <dig> diabetes mellitus  has led to recent successful discoveries of novel disease-related genes through the use of large scale genome-wide association studies including thousands of patients belonging to major ethnic groups  <cit> . disease-associated loci often fail to replicate in different populations, because of patterns of population-specific susceptibility  <cit> . this may occur due to genetic drift and founder effects, turning minor alleles in a certain populations to prevalent ones in another population. one may hypothesize that some of these alleles carry functional effects underlying differences in disease susceptibility between populations. revealing such an effect requires mining special populations, such as the jews, that due to bottleneck events have increased incidence of alleles that are less abundant in the general population.

the jewish people underwent several recent bottleneck events after the  <dig> year old babylonian and  <dig> year old roman deportation from israel  <cit> . these resulted in geographically separated jewish communities that kept their customs and religion over centuries, mostly marrying within the communities with little or no intermarriage with local non-jews, suggesting several founder events. thus, jews represent an excellent model to study possible association of population-specific alleles with common disorders, including t2dm  <cit> .

t2dm is the most common metabolic disease today, with increasing incidence in the western world . growing evidence for dysfunction of the mitochondrial energy production machinery  in many t2dm patients  <cit>  highlights the role of altered oxphos activity in the molecular basis leading to the common forms of t2dm:  approximately 1% of diabetic patients have large mitochondrial dna  deletions or the a3243g point mutation  <cit> ;  expression of oxphos-related genes is decreased in muscle tissues of diabetic individuals  <cit> ;  mitochondrial atp production is decreased and intra-myocellular fat content is increased in offspring of t2dm patients  <cit> ;  in pancreatic beta-cells of mice, cellular depletion of mtdna and knock-out of mitochondrial transcription factor a  interfere with insulin secretion  <cit> .

given that t2dm is a common complex disorder with considerable heritability, it is probably influenced by a combination of predisposing common genetic variants, potentially including mtdna variants. although mtdna genetic variants have previously been associated with complex disorders in some populations  <cit> , its extensive genetic variability  <cit>  and uniparental inheritance may result in diverse association among specific populations  <cit> . indeed, mtdna genetic association with t2dm exemplifies the differences among populations: significant association of certain mtdna genetic backgrounds  was found in asians  <cit>  but not in caucasians as documented in a recent large scale analysis  <cit> . additionally, association of mtdna variants with t2dm was limited to specific populations  <cit> . the only example of a mtdna variant  associated with t2dm in both caucasian and chinese populations  <cit>  was recently questioned  <cit> .

similar to t2dm, diabetic complications are complex phenotypes determined by multiple pathways with a large genetic component. diabetic complications increase markedly in incidence after 5– <dig> years of active t2dm, but with extreme variability in onset and progression, i.e. some individuals developing severe complications relatively early in the disease course, while others fail to develop any significant complications despite many years of severe disease. being responsible for most t2dm-associated mortality, diabetic complications involve pathology in small and large vessels , encompassing malfunction of the mitochondrial oxphos  <cit> . thus, mtdna variants could be logical candidates to alter the genetic risk to the major diabetic complications- nephropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular disease  <cit> .

to search for possible population-specific association between mtdna common genetic variants and the common complications of t2dm we examined mtdna genetic variability in three jewish populations: ashkenazi, sephardic and north african jews.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  t2dm patients comprised of three populations , were genotyped and assigned to different mtdna haplogroups. almost 90% of the subjects belonged to one of the  <dig> most prevalent mtdna haplogroups in ashkenazi jews, i.e., k <dig>  k <dig>  u , h, v, j <dig>  j <dig>  t, n1b, i, x, w . r × c test of independence  <cit>  indicated that haplogroup distribution varied significantly among the three jewish patients populations , implying that each of these patients populations should be analyzed separately. specifically, there was an over-representation of haplogroup t in seph patients, hv* in naf patients, haplogroups k <dig>  k <dig> and n1b in the ashkenazi patients. although the observed differences are among populations of patients and do not necessarily apply to the general population, our data is in line with previous reports of differences in mtdna haplotypes distribution among jewish populations, thus supporting the hypothesis that separate founder events led to the establishment these different jewish populations   <cit> . furthermore, sequencing of the mtdna hyper variable region  <dig>  of haplogroup n1b patients in our populations revealed that the ashkenazi population harbored only the 16145-16176a- <dig> motif termed "n1b1" which is extremely rare in other populations, whereas of the seven seph n1b patients, five harbored the n1b <dig> motif and two harbored a 16145-16176g- <dig> motif termed "n1b2" which is found at low prevalence in caucasians. haplogroup n1b was totally absent from the naf population, thus further supporting separate bottleneck events in the ash, seph and naf populations.

this significant genetic divergence of mtdna genetic variation could result in population-specific signals of mtdna association with complex disorders. in order to evaluate this we have assessed possible association of mtdna haplogroups with the major complications of t2dm separately within each of the three populations. this approach enabled minimizing the possible effects of population stratification. first, each population was divided into patients that had developed cardiovascular disease, retinopathy or nephropathy  and a group of patients who did not develop any of these complications after at least  <dig> years of known diabetes . these complications were chosen because of their high prevalence in t2dm and since the organs involved  are highly affected in mitochondrial disorders  <cit> .

1hv* – samples belonging to the hv lineage, excluding haplogroup h but including haplogroup v. 2others – include haplogroups jt* and l in addition to unclassified, probably non-european haplogroups. **after removing the two j <dig> patients , we were left only with j <dig> patients; thus, the sample size of the "no-complications" group was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig>  and that of the total population from  <dig> to  <dig> 

1hv* – see table  <dig>  2others – see table  <dig>  **after removing the j <dig> patients , we were left only with j <dig> patients; thus, the sample size was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> for the total population and the complications groups were adjusted accordingly.

1hv* – see table  <dig> others – see table  <dig>  **after removing the j <dig> patients , we were left only with j <dig> patients; thus, the sample size was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> for the total population and the complications groups were adjusted accordingly.

in an attempt to identify candidate haplogroups for association with t2dm complications a permutation analysis was performed . in the ash population haplogroup j <dig> was detected as a plausible candidate for association with retinopathy and nephropathy  and haplogroup n1b <dig> for association with nephropathy  . in the seph population haplogroup aggregate hv* and haplogroup t were detected as borderline candidates for association with retinopathy  and nephropathy , respectively . in the naf population haplogroup aggregate hv* was detected as a candidate for association with nephropathy and cardiovascular disease  .

these results suggest that the differences in haplogroup distribution may result in different disease-associated mtdna factors in each population. to rigorously investigate the involvement of mtdna haplogroups in the tendency to develop t2dm complications we focused only on the significant candidate haplogroups .

mtdna haplogroups j <dig> and n1b associate with t2dm complications in ashkenazi jews
using a logistic regression model and appropriate bonferonni correction we compared the candidate haplogroups with each of the other haplogroups while controlling for the possible effects of patient characteristics . a possible association of a population specific mtdna haplogroup with t2dm complications could be best tested in our ashkenazi population , since n1b <dig> is an apparently ashkenazi-specific haplogroup. our analyses revealed that haplogroup n1b was significantly under-represented in the nephropathy group and in the cardiovascular group as compared with the no-complication group relative to all other haplogroups  =  <dig>  , and p =  <dig> , or =  <dig>  , respectively; also see additional file  <dig> – table 2). in the retinopathy group however, no significant association with n1b was found. these results imply that ashkenazi t2dm patients pertaining to haplogroup n1b exhibit reduced susceptibility to the tested t2dm complications.

in contrast to haplogroup n1b, haplogroup j <dig> was over-represented in the ash population only in the microvascular complications . a significant and specific effect of haplogroup j <dig> could be masked by including patients who exhibit more than one complication in each of the tested groups. this premise is supported by the view that the risks of developing each of the different complications are not entirely independent. retinopathy and nephropathy may have some common pathophysiological features, and nephropathy per se may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. hence reciprocal interactions among the complications could mask the effect of certain genetic backgrounds. to test for the possibility that patients pertaining to mitochondrial haplogroup j <dig> exhibit preferentially altered susceptibility to either microvascular or macrovascular complications, we performed the analysis on groups of t2dm patients having nephropathy or retinopathy but no evidence of cardiovascular disease and on t2dm patients with cardiovascular disease who did not develop either nephropathy or retinopathy . this demonstrated a significant over-representation of haplogroup j <dig> in the "isolated" nephropathy group  and in the "isolated" retinopathy group . however, no such trends could be detected in the "isolated" cardiovascular group. these results suggest that mutations defining mtdna haplogroup j <dig> increase the propensity of ashkenazi t2dm patients to develop nephropathy or retinopathy but not cardiovascular complications.

mtdna haplogroups associate with t2dm complications in non-ashkenazi jews
in accordance with our permutation test, logistic regression analysis revealed that naf patients pertaining to the hv* haplogroup aggregate had a threefold risk of developing nephropathy  and a fourfold risk of developing cardiovascular disease  . notably our permutation test showed the same tendency towards over-representation of haplogroup hv* in seph patients with nephropathy  with borderline significance .

taken together these observations suggest that different mtdna haplogroups may play a role in the propensity of jewish t2dm patients to develop complications in the studied populations and that this propensity may be population specific.

evaluating the functional significance of mutations defining haplogroups n1b and j1
extensive study has shown several mutations affecting nucleotide positions with a high degree of evolutionary conservation in haplogroup j <dig>  possibly underlying their phenotypic consequences   <cit> . far less attention has been devoted to haplogroup n1b, although a recent study did indicate a difference between n1b sequences of ashkenazi jewish origin and n1b sequences in other groups  <cit> . to decipher the mutations underlying the phenotypic consequences of haplogroup n1b in the ash population, we analyzed  <dig> whole n1b mtdna sequences,  <dig> of which from ashkenazi jews, seven from other middle-eastern populations and one from a population of european origin. sequence alignment and phylogenetic neighbor joining tree reconstruction, including a haplogroup i sequence as an out-group, revealed that sequences of ashkenazi jewish origin form a branch distinct from those of other middle-eastern populations . a close investigation of the sequences revealed nine coding region mutations in the stem of haplogroup n1b and additional eight mutations in the ashkenazi n1b tree node , whereas only three mutations lead to the non-jewish tree node . the n1b <dig> node harbors five amino acid changes in addition to the three amino-acid changes in the stem of the haplogroup. none of the changes in the n1b <dig> node alters an amino acid .

to test for the potential of the n1b-haplogroup-defining changes to alter function, we studied their degree of evolutionary conservation by investigating the alignment of mtdna gene sequences from  <dig> different vertebrates and invertebrates . the degree of conservation was ranked high only if it fell within one standard deviation range from the mean conservation degree of mtdna disease-causing mutations  <cit>  . strikingly, only the n1b <dig> node  holds highly conserved changes in addition to three highly conserved changes in the n1b stem thus supporting their potential involvement in the protective effect of haplogroup n1b <dig> 

discussion
mtdna genes, in contrast to nuclear dna -encoded genes, are in full linkage disequilibrium. the mutation rate of the mtdna is ~ <dig> times faster than that of the ndna and thus it is the most variable coding region in the human genome. since mtdna is maternally inherited, it is prone to genetic drift, resulting in large differences in patterns of genetic variability among and within populations  <cit> . such genetic drift often leads to difficulties in replicating results of mtdna association studies among populations. hence, we hypothesized that, due to its high genetic divergence among populations, a subset of mtdna alleles with functional consequences will differentiate among distinct populations. here we have shown that recent bottleneck events within the three studied jewish populations , underlie marked differences in mtdna diversity in three ethnically-related jewish populations, resulting in increased frequency of genotypes in some populations, some of which may act as susceptibility factors to t2dm complications. such was the case in the haplogroup n1b <dig> that was significantly under-represented in certain complications of the ashkenazi population and not present in the naf population.

in contrast to haplogroup n1b <dig>  the haplogroups identified as factors with risk trends to some t2dm complications  were present in all three studied populations. nevertheless haplogroup j <dig>  showing association with increased risk for t2dm nephropathy or retinopathy in the ashkenazi population does not have enough power to replicate in the seph and naf populations, i.e. ~ <dig> subjects in each of the complications groups to replicate the significant results of the ash population ) . the significant over-representation of haplogroup aggregate hv* in certain complications of the naf population is harder to interpret, since although there was enough power to detect its effect in the ashkenazi population, i.e. ~ <dig> subjects in each of the complication groups in order to detect significance with a power of 80% and α< <dig>  , it did not show the same tendency as in the naf population. nevertheless one should take into account that hv* is a haplogroup aggregate; hence the different bottleneck events leading to the establishment of the ashkenazi and north african jewish populations could result in different compositions of lineages comprising the hv* haplogroup aggregate in the two populations. testing for this possibility needs further genotyping of hv*, requiring increased sample sizes of the studied populations.

our findings support association of mtdna common genetic variants with sub-phenotypes of t2dm. interestingly, the inconsistency of mtdna genetic association with complications of t2dm as found here was described for other phenotypes as well: while haplogroup j has been associated with successful longevity in northern italians and the finnish  <cit> , it was not associated with successful longevity in southern italians  <cit>  and subhaplogroup j <dig>  but not j <dig>  was associated with successful longevity in the northern irish  <cit> . therefore, both differences in mtdna sub-groups and their differences in response to environment appear to affect the relationship between mtdna genotypes and phenotypes. since all of the functional snps in particular mtdna lineages would have a collective effect on mitochondrial function, many mtdna haplogroups and sub-haplogroups might interact with environmental variation differently. furthermore, this difference can be further complicated by the interaction of mtdna encoded subunits, harboring functional snps, with nuclear dna encoded subunits, harboring their own genetic variation. this interpretation applies to our observation that n1b <dig> reduces the risk to t2dm complications only in ashkenazi jews. in addition, the tendency to develop complications is an interplay of environment and genetics, hence it is not solely dependent on a particular haplogroup, and thus the absence of the n1b <dig> haplogroup in the naf cohort is not expected to change significantly the overall risk do develop complications.

since our study observed disease-association with a population specific haplogroup, the ashkenazi specific n1b <dig>  it was of importance to assess the functional potential of this haplogroup defining mutations. during our sequence analysis of haplogroup n1b we noticed that the ash-specific sub-haplogroup n1b <dig> harbors an amino acid substitution in mtdna position  <dig> , which also defines haplogroup t that was previously associated with reduced sperm motility  <cit> . interestingly, our permutation test suggests with borderline significance that haplogroup t might be in association  with some t2dm complications in the seph population. previously  <cit>  we showed that this mutation alters a highly conserved amino acid in the nd <dig> gene, hence suggesting a functional potential. since haplogroups n1b <dig> and t stem from very different branches in the human mtdna phylogeny it can be concluded that the  <dig> mutation was established at least twice during human evolution. all these evidence imply that the change at position  <dig> contributes to the protective effect against certain t2dm complications.

along with haplogroup j <dig> association with other multi-factorial phenotypes  <cit> , and its effect on the penetrance of mutations causing the eye disorder lhon  <cit>  our results support the premise that mutations defining this haplogroup affect oxphos. similar to haplogroup n1b <dig>  some mutations defining haplogroup j <dig> alter amino-acids with high conservation degree:  a transition in position  <dig> which is a thr114ala replacement in the nd <dig> subunit of complex i, shown to alter mitochondrial matrix ph in cell-culture experiments  <cit> ; and  a transition in position  <dig>  causing a ala458thr replacement in the nd <dig> complex i subunit. in addition, haplogroup j <dig> harbors the g3010a substitution located within the 12srrna gene. although this mutation has been found in several haplogroups  <cit> , it is possible that the combination of this mutation with the mutations that generally define haplogroup j underlies the phenotypic effect of j <dig> in the ash population.

interestingly, the non-synonymous changes in haplogroups j <dig> and n1b <dig> altered highly conserved amino-acid positions in oxphos complex i, implying that they possibly affect the activity of this complex  <cit> . accordingly, anti-diabetic agents  act specifically through the inhibition of complex i activity  <cit> , which suggests a role for complex i functional alteration in the etiology of t2dm.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results revealed notable differences in mtdna genetic diversity within jews. our association study of mtdna genetic variants with t2dm complications showed, that the differences in haplogroup distribution in the three studied populations were associated with differences in disease susceptibility factors. these findings supported our working hypothesis that minor alleles overlooked in large scale association studies may reveal their functional potential in genetic isolates.
