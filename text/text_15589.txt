BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are a large and dynamically evolving part of plant genomes  <cit> . they occupy between 15% - 84% of plant genomes  <cit>  and te expansion is known to cause a significant increase in genome size in many cases  <cit> . transposable elements are a major force in plant evolution, not only by causing genome expansions but also by altering gene function either through disruption  <cit>  or acting as a raw material for new genes and novel functions  <cit> .

transposable elements are usually classified into two major classes based on their transposition mechanisms. class i retrotransposons move about in a ‘copy-and-paste’ fashion, through a rna intermediate, which is encoded back into dna by an endogenous reverse transcriptase  enzyme  <cit> . the two largest super-families of retrotransposons in plants, the ltr/copia and ltr/gypsy, have several other open reading frames, which play a role in the transposition, located between two regions of long terminal repeats   <cit> . class ii dna elements move about in genomes through a dna intermediate. the most extensively studied group of class ii elements transpose by a ‘cut-and-paste’ mechanism and are classified into several super-families based on sequence similarity  <cit> . cut-and-paste dna transposons are characterized by a transposase gene and a pair of flanking terminal inverted repeats   <cit> .

transposable elements are known to vary extensively in copy-number and nucleotide sequence among closely related species  <cit>  and even within the same species  <cit> . plant ltr retrotransposons are well known to have intraspecific variation in copy-number  <cit> . this, in combination with the easily amplifiable ltr domain, has been used in the development of molecular markers for several crop species  <cit> . in addition to the extensive presence/absence variability of the ltr elements, sequence heterogeneity is also known to be quite extensive  <cit> . the reverse transcriptase domain is the most extensively studied retrotransposon gene and it is known to show levels of heterogeneity from about 5% to 75% at the amino acid level  <cit> . heterogeneity and sequence evolution of class ii dna transposons is relatively less studied, but a recent study shows that they can be quite heterogeneous  <cit> .

cacao  is an economically important tree in the mallow family   <cit> . it is widely grown in tropical regions as the source of cocoa beans for the manufacture of chocolate  <cit> . cacao has long been known to be genetically diverse  <cit>  and traditionally three major lineages of cacao varieties have been recognized: trinitario, criollo, and forastero  <cit> . recent work based on a variety of markers, including microsatellites and whole chloroplast genome sequences of several cacao varieties, has confirmed that the criollo and forastero groups are two distinct genetic lineages while the trinitario group is of hybrid origin  <cit> . cacao has a relatively small genome, estimated to be around 430 mb and it has a published genome assembly of about 75% of its estimated genome size  <cit> . this small genome size can be partly explained by the relatively low abundance of transposable elements, compared to other angiosperms. tes comprise only approximately a quarter of the cacao genome  <cit> .

in this study we use low-coverage illumina whole genome shotgun sequencing to investigate the evolutionary dynamics and comparative analysis of  <dig>  te families in nine t. cacao varieties and two related species, theobroma grandiflorum and herrania balaensis.

RESULTS
sequence coverage estimates and phylogenetic analysis using the ucos contigs
the illumina sequencing yielded  <dig>  –  <dig>  gbp of high quality sequence per sample . average coverage of the ultra-conserved orthologous sequences , estimated with bwa mapping, varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> x per sample . this value represents a relative measure of per single copy locus sequencing depth for our libraries. however it is important to note that this method may slightly underestimate the sequencing coverage of h. balaensis and t. grandiflorum due to sequence divergence in the ucos among the three species. furthermore the results using ucos are consistent with results using flow cytometry genome size estimates  the ucos data was used to standardize the te data between samples to provide relative te abundance data. it was also used to estimate the relatedness of the accessions in order to provide an evolutionary framework for te variation.

illumina sequence summary statistics and observed average coverage of the ucos contigs for theobroma cacao, t. grandiflorum and herrania balaensis based on burrows-wheeler aligner  alignments.

the ucos contigs were informative for the phylogenetic analysis of h. balaensis, t. grandiflorum and nine of the t. cacao varieties . scavina- <dig> was excluded from the phylogenetic analysis due to low sequencing depth. the matrix used to construct the phylogeny consisted of  <dig> ucos contigs with combined length of  <dig>  nucleotides. individual ucos alignments varied in length, with the shortest alignment being  <dig> nucleotides and the longest  <dig>  nucleotides. herrania balaensis was set as the outgroup in the analysis which resulted in two main theobroma clades . the first clade consists of only t. grandiflorum, with a 100% bootstrap support, and the second consisting of all t. cacao individuals. this is as expected given that t. grandiflorum and t. cacao are biologically distinct species. within t. cacao there are two well-supported clades with t. cacao cv. stahel and amelonado grouping together and another well-supported grouping of t. cacao cv. pentagonum, ics <dig>  ics <dig>  criollo- <dig> and b <dig> . b <dig> is the variety used in the whole genome sequencing project of t. cacao <cit> . eet- <dig> and ics <dig> are unresolved on a polytomy.

variation in te abundance using short read mapping
the coverage of the single copy ucos genes was used as a baseline for standardization of te coverage. using this method, copy-numbers of te superfamilies relative to the ucos coverage in the three species were calculated . the intraspecific variation of copy-number in theobroma cacao is represented by the error bars. the ltr super-families are the most numerous elements in the genomes of h. balaensis, t. grandiflorum and t. cacao, as previously shown. the difference in relative copy-number of class i ltr retroelements between the three species is quite striking. using this method and the estimated genome sizes for the species  <cit> , it can be calculated that ltr/gypsy and ltr/copia elements make up 9% and 7% of the genome respectively in t. cacao. in contrast these make up just 2% and 2% in t. grandiflorum and  <dig> % and  <dig> % in herrania . de novo approaches show the low values in the latter species to be artefacts . the apparently lower numbers in species distant from the reference are therefore likely due to mapping incompatibility, and this method is therefore not suitable for interspecies studies. the same pattern is also observed even when reads are mapped to the conserved regions of the ltr retrotransposons using less stringent settings in the short read aligner . mapping incompatibility is most likely attributable to retroelement divergence between distant species. this divergence is an important part of genome differentiation between species and potentially has implications for speciation and species divergence. on the other hand de novo methods are efficient in identifying any repetitive sequence that is either specific to a given species or has mutated beyond recognition that could render it unidentifiable using the mapping approach and therefore likely to be much more accurate for calculating copy numbers in species outside the reference species .

comparison of estimated ltr retrotransposon frequencies as percentages of the genome, calculated with reference based mapping  and graph based clustering . within t. cacao there is little discrepancy between the methods. heterologous mapping between species produces different results suggesting that graph-based clustering may be more appropriate for inter-species comparisons .

variation of te copy number using de novo approaches
a major potential problem with studying interspecific variation using a mapping approach is that the reads from herrania and t. grandiflorum are heterologously mapped to the t. cacao genome. sequence variation between species affecting mapping quality could potentially have a considerable effect on the apparent frequency of tes. we therefore employed a de novo approach in addition, using graph-based clustering. the graph based clustering analysis  of the short reads shows considerable differences in the representation of the major families of repetitive elements in the genomes of the three species studied here. figure  <dig> shows the four largest clusters generated by repeatexplorer, their identity and genome percentage. the most striking difference is between the two genera, where h. balaensis has two extremely large low complexity clusters with combined genome percentage of  <dig> %. the two theobroma species are more similar, with their largest clusters containing about 1-2% of the reads used in the graph based clustering. however, cluster  <dig> in t. cacao is largely composed of ltr/gypsy elements, whereas the top four clusters in t. grandiflorum are all identified as low complexity elements. using graph based clustering it can be calculated that ltr/gypsy and ltr/copia elements make up 10% and 5% of the genome respectively in t. cacao , whereas in herrania they are 4% and 7% and in theobroma grandiflorum 10% and 9%. this contrasts with the different figures arrived at for the other species using the mapping approach . we conclude from comparing the results of mapping with the de novo approach that mapping quality in interspecific comparison has an important effect on the results. for a complete list of graph layouts of all clusters, see additional file  <dig> 

intraspecific variation of te abundance in t. cacao using short read mapping and pca
the data on intraspecific relative abundance of tes from short read mapping of the eight t. cacao accessions was analysed using principal coordinates analysis  . the first two axes include 81% of the variance. axis  <dig>  separates most strongly the stahel and amelonado varieties from the criollo <dig> variety. tes with the highest loadings on this axis are dna transposons such as dna/hat and ltr retrotransposon such as copia. axis  <dig>  separates most strongly scavina- <dig> from criollo <dig>  tes that load most strongly onto this axis are dna transposons such as mutator and harbinger and gypsy retrotransposons. this analysis clearly separates most of the t. cacao samples and shows several clusters of cacao accessions with the first two axes, some of which accord well with phylogenetic relatedness. due to concerns that these results might be due to a sampling artefact, particularly given that scavina- <dig> has the lowest coverage, the pca analysis was repeated individually on  <dig> sub-sampled datasets that were equal in size. however, the same general pattern described above was always observed .

sequence conservation of transposable elements in t. cacao
mapping of the short reads of the nine t. cacao libraries to the te reference contigs revealed considerable levels of within species nucleotide variability, as calculated by number of nucleotide variants detected, divided by the length of the reference contigs. the nucleotide variability in the class ii dna transposons was around  <dig> times less than in the class i retroelements . these results illustrate different modes of sequence evolution in class i retroelements and class ii dna elements in the t. cacao studied here.

comparing the nucleotide variability in two classes of tes is informative with regard to how these elements evolve on the whole but it sheds no light on what parts of individual elements are causing these differences. ltrdigest was able to identify characteristic features of ltr elements in  <dig> of the  <dig> class i families identified in  <cit> . in those  <dig> families, 90% of the nucleotide variability lay outside of protein coding genes and the long terminal repeats , while 5% was in situated within the ltrs and 5% in genes . reverse transcriptase  was the largest contributor, containing about 3% of total nucleotide variability followed by integrase with about  <dig> % and the three remaining genes contributed all less than 1% . however these values are only informative of total variation not rates of variation, because they differ both in length and representation. ltrdigest does not identify all features in all the elements it interrogated. a better representation of the variability of the ltr genes and the long terminal repeat is to divide the number of nucleotide variants by the length of each feature, which yields a comparable estimate to the previously calculated nucleotide diversity. those calculations show that the genes and the long terminal repeat all share a similar value, ranging from about  <dig>  to  <dig> , which are similar values to the average nucleotide diversity of the class i ltr retroelements shown in figure  <dig> 

discussion
the study of transposable elements  has been revolutionized by the increased availability and lowered costs of next generation sequencing  technologies  <cit> . ngs methods have not only been applied in te studies of plants with high quality whole genomic sequences available such as zea luxurians <cit>  and rice   <cit>  but also in organisms with limited genomic resources available such as barley , pea  and banana   <cit> . these studies demonstrate a strong correlation between copy-number estimation of tes by traditional molecular methods and methods that count short reads from ngs experiments  <cit> . it was therefore not surprising that the copy-number estimation of tes in this study fitted very well with previously published estimates in t. cacao, both in regard to the overall te abundance in the genome, around 23%, and in the copy-number of the most abundant class i retroelement  <cit> . our study therefore confirms the utility and reliability of studying genomic repeats using short reads directly.

different levels of nucleotide conservation in class i and class ii tes
the two major classes of te, class i retroelements and class ii dna transposons, have been recognized for a long time as two fundamentally different groups of mobile elements probably present in all eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . the results presented in this study illustrate a considerable difference in the apparent conservation of the tes in the genome of t. cacao, where the class i retrotransposons show significantly higher levels of heterogeneity, represented by an order of magnitude higher level of nucleotide diversity . this may be simply because dna transposons are more narrowly defined at the superfamily level. however, one possible biological explanation of the high levels of heterogeneity in class i retroelements results from their transposition mechanism, as described in detail in  <cit> . class i retrotransposons move about as a rna intermediate, which is encoded into dna before re-entry into the host genome by their endogenous reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is known to be low-fidelity, causing a high mutation rate  <cit> .

inter- and intraspecific differences in te abundance in h. balaensis, t. grandiflorum and t. cacao
transposable elements are known to cause large inter- and intraspecific differences in the size and composition of plant genomes, demonstrated in barley   <cit>  and rice   <cit> . however, our study only found relatively subtle intraspecific differences of the overall te abundance in t. cacao. nevertheless this slight intraspecific variation in te copy number does potentially contribute to the variable genome sizes of different cacao accessions reported in the supplementary material in the t. cacao genome paper and other sources  <cit> . furthermore using a pca approach to differentiate accessions based on te abundance, wide separations do occur . the ability to separate cacao accessions according to te composition is despite the fact that they are all closely related, some being of recent hybrid origin  <cit> . as massive parallel sequencing  costs fall, there is interest in using mps to identify accessions, and such use has been called “ultra-barcoding”  <cit> . this paper shows that data generated for ultra-barcoding could also be used for “transposon composition fingerprinting” of cacao accessions .

mapping vs. de novo approaches to studying tes from short reads
our results  suggest that the mapping approach, while reliable within the reference species , is unreliable in interspecific comparisons, at least for some te families. the mapping approach reports considerable differences in the composition of repetitive elements in the three species studied . apparently the genomes of t. grandiflorum and h. balaensis are significantly deficient in many ltr retrotransposons families that are very abundant in t. cacao . however this difference may be at least partly caused by low interspecific mapping quality of the short reads, since our reference contigs originate from the genome of t. cacao. the ltr retrotransposon families in particular have high nucleotide diversity , which is likely to cause problems in the mapping of the short reads.

the evidence for the failure of the mapping approach in interspecific comparisons comes from the de novo approach of graph based clustering using repeatexplorer. this demonstrates that in both t. grandiflorum and h. balaensis the ltr te families are more abundant than the mapping approach suggested . more importantly the graph based clustering showed that the composition of h. balaensis and t. grandiflorum is quite different from t. cacao. therefore we conclude that mapping based approaches are well suited to look at te evolution in an intraspecific manner whereas de novo methods, such as graph based clustering, are much more useful in the exploration of differences in repetitive elements across species boundaries.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates considerable differences in transposable element composition among and even within species, highlighting their dynamic role in plant genome evolution. variation of transposable elements in plants is important especially given the great abundance of transposable elements in plant genomes and their potential impact on the genespace. we used two different methods of looking at transposable element variation from illumina short read data: reference-based mapping and graph-based clustering. both are effective at capturing variation, although each is appropriate at different levels of taxonomic comparison. reference based mapping works well within a species while graph-based clustering is preferred for between species comparisons.
