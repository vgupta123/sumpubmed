BACKGROUND
escherichia coli is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in newborn and weaned pigs  <cit>  with postweaning diarrhea  as the main health problem in piggeries and has caused significant losses in the swine industry worldwide  <cit> . the main causal agents of pwd are verotoxin -producing e. coli , also known as shiga-toxin -producing e. coli  and enterotoxigenic e. coli   <cit> . enterohemorrhagic e. coli  and enteropathogenic e. coli  have also been found associated with pwd  <cit> . vtec is characterized by the production of vts  which disrupt protein synthesis whereas etec is characterized by the production of heat labile enterotoxin  and heat stable enterotoxin   <cit> . among the pathogenic e. coli, vtec o <dig> is often the main focus of most surveillance programs due to its association with severe human infections. however, monitoring should be extended to other serotypes as cases of human infections caused by non-o <dig> vtec are substantial  <cit> . furthermore, serotypes involved in porcine pwd were mostly non-related to human infections  <cit> .

pathogenicity of e. coli is associated with bacterial fimbrial adhesins which enable the bacteria to adhere to the cell lining of the small intestine and colonize the host  <cit> . a number of fimbrial adhesins have been associated with pwd caused by pathogenic e. coli in pigs namely the f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> fimbriae  <cit>  with f <dig> and f <dig> as the most common adhesins  <cit> . despite the substantial number of swine farms in malaysia, there is a dearth of published information on the characteristics of pathogenic e. coli infection in pigs from malaysian farms. hence, the objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of different e. coli pathotypes in malaysian swine samples and to further characterize the pathogenic e. coli with respect to their antibiograms, production of extended spectrum β-lactamases , virulence genes, fimbrial adhesive genes, serotypes, production of hemolysins and genetic diversity. the outcome of this study would provide information on the prevalence and characteristics of pathogenic e. coli as a cause of post-weaning diseases in pigs in malaysia.

RESULTS
isolation and confirmation of e. coli isolates from post-weaning piglets and growers
a total of  <dig> post-weaning piglets  and  <dig> growers  [from farms d , e , and f  from the state of perak and farms g , h , and i  from penang were selected and three swab types  were sampled from each pig. a total of  <dig> presumptive e. coli isolates were obtained from these  <dig> pigs. out of  <dig> presumptive e. coli isolates,  <dig>  were confirmed as e. coli as they were phoa-positive by pcr  <cit>  .

virulence and adhesion genes
none of the  <dig> isolates was positive for the lt <dig>  lt <dig>  st and eaea genes while  <dig> isolates were verotoxin -positive and were thus termed as verotoxin-producing e. coli . of the  <dig> vtec isolates,  <dig> were obtained from the same swab samples of  <dig> animals , hence, only one vtec isolate from each animal was further characterized. overall,  <dig> vtec isolates were subjected to further characterization. these  <dig> vtec isolates were obtained from three swine farms located in penang and no vtec was found in the farms that were sampled in perak. of the  <dig> vtec,  <dig> were obtained from farm g  and  <dig> each from farms h and i . vtec were obtained from all three swab types  . five vtec were isolated from unhealthy pigs  while  <dig> were from a healthy pig  . all the vts belonged to subtype 2e . only  <dig> type of fimbrial gene, f <dig> was detected in  <dig> of the  <dig> vtec isolates  and none was positive for f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> 

serotyping of vtec
o antigen typing using both conventional and molecular methods revealed three o serogroups, namely o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  the determination of the h serogroup for o <dig> e. coli isolates using molecular typing method was inconclusive as the amino acid sequence of the respective h antigens shared highest similarity with h <dig> , h <dig>  and a peculiar h <dig> flagellin  . very low degree of sequence identity was observed for the common h <dig> flagellin sequence  with the h antigen sequence obtained from our study . the respective rflp of the flic gene also resembled h <dig> as described previously by fields et al.,  <cit>  . however, the phenotypic result showed that the respective h antigen belonged to serogroup h <dig>  nevertheless, the h serogroup of these strains were designated h <dig> based on the molecular data since conventional h serotyping is reported to have discrepancy and uncertainty  <cit> . the representative flic dna sequence obtained in this study has been deposited in genbank under the accession number kc <dig> 

overall, h antigen typing using both conventional and molecular methods revealed the presence of serotypes o139:h <dig> , o130:h <dig>  and o168:h <dig>  among the vtec isolates. the most common serotype was o139:h <dig> which was isolated from different pigs in the same pen in farm g in penang.

genotypes of vtec based on pfge and rep-pcr
five out of  <dig> vtec isolates shared an indistinguishable pulsotype designated a <dig> . these  <dig> vtec isolates were obtained from the same farm and  <dig> of them were isolated from the same animal but from different swab samples. the remaining  <dig> isolates were isolated from  <dig> different farms in penang and showed unrelated pulsotypes . rep-pcr profiling also revealed only  <dig> distinct patterns with one rep profile found for each farm . isolates that shared the same pulsotype  had the same rep profile . all  <dig> isolates with the same serotype shared an indistinguishable pulsotype and rep profile while another two were genetically different.

antibiograms and esbl producers
all vtec isolates were multidrug resistant as they were resistant to at least  <dig> groups of antimicrobials. they showed 100% resistance to tet, amp, nal, sxt, kan, chl, spt, and aml . however, none of the vtec was esbl positive.

haemolytic activity
six out of the  <dig> vtec isolates were beta-hemolytic as indicated by the zone of clearing on the defribinated, washed sheep blood agar after  <dig> hours of incubation. these  <dig> isolates were also positive for the α-hly gene. none of the isolates was positive for the e-hly gene.

discussion
etec and vtec are common etiologic agents for pwd in pigs worldwide. however, the distribution of such pathogenic e. coli in the swine population in malaysia is unknown and there is limited information for the southeast asian region. different pathotypes of e. coli are known to be associated with specific virulence factors. among the  <dig> virulence factors tested in this study, only verotoxin  was detected and at a low prevalence of  <dig> % . thus vtec appeared to be the only pathotype identified from the swine samples in north-western peninsular malaysia. however, a larger sample size would be needed in any future studies to estimate the true prevalence rates of pathogenic e. coli among the malaysian swine populations. a recent study from thailand  <cit>  reported a relatively higher prevalence of vtec  from pigs with pwd. the results obtained in this study and that of prapasarakul et al. <cit>  were in contrast with earlier reports by zhang et al. <cit>  and fairbrother et al.  <cit>  who reported etec as the most common pathotype found in pigs with pwd in the united states and worldwide, respectively. the vt detected in this study belonged to subtype vt2e. although oanh et al.  <cit>  reported that vt2e is commonly associated with oedema in pigs, however, none of the vtec-infected pigs in this study showed signs of oedema. nevertheless, pigs with oedema often suffer sudden death  <cit> , hence these infected pigs are difficult to observe.

of the  <dig> vtec isolates,  <dig> were obtained from weaners and  <dig> from grower. colonization of the guts of newly weaned piglets with pathogenic bacteria often occurs as the absorption and digestion of the gut is disturbed due to dietary changes  <cit> . a majority of the vtec isolates  were also isolated from unhealthy pigs inferring the undesirable outcome to the health conditions of the pigs due to infections.

h antigen typing for isolates with serogroup o <dig> yielded ambiguous result as the conventional serotyping method yielded h <dig>  while the flic sequence analysis closely matched to h <dig> type . serotyping has been reported to have limited sensitivity and specificity  <cit>  and the result may not always be reliable. hence, the h type for the o <dig> isolates was designated h <dig> . the discrepancy in h serotyping results using both molecular and conventional serotyping methods had also been encountered by reid et al. <cit>  for an epec strain  with serotype o128:h <dig> which was investigated with respect to its flic gene sequence. it was found that the amino acid sequence  best resembles h <dig>  and h <dig>  out of the 527-amino acid residues of the flagellin protein  although the conventional serotyping revealed that it belongs to serogroup h <dig>  however, the discrepancies in the result were not discussed by reid et al. <cit>  in their paper. coincidentally, the amino acid sequence of the “h2” flagellin obtained from strain e74/ <dig> shared relatively high sequence identity with the h <dig> flagellin obtained in our study  .

swine vtec has been reported to be associated with specific serogroups such as o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig>  <cit>  and indeed, the major o serogroup identified in this study is o <dig>  e. coli serotype o157:h <dig>  which is commonly known to be a serious food-borne pathogen throughout the world, was not detected in this study. o139:h <dig>  the most prevalent serotype in this study, has been reported worldwide to cause swine diseases such as pwd and oedema  <cit> . it has also been reported to be one of the major serotypes associated with diseased pigs  <cit> . the other two serotypes identified in this study were o130:h <dig> and o168:h <dig>  o130:h <dig> is considered as a rare serotype as it has only been reported once and was isolated from the stool sample of a diarrhea patient  <cit>  while e. coli with serotype o168:h <dig> has not been described in any study before. to the best of our knowledge, serotypes o130:h <dig> and o168:h <dig> have not been previously associated with swine diseases and are also considered as infrequently encountered e. coli serotypes.

vtec producing f <dig> and f <dig> fimbrial adhesins are one of the most common pathogens associated with diarrheas in pigs worldwide  <cit> . in our study, the f <dig> fimbriae was the most common, which concurred with the findings of vu khac et al.  <cit>  in slovakia while other studies by zhang et al.  <cit>  and madoroba et al.  <cit>  showed that f <dig> was the prevalent type of fimbriae in pathogenic e. coli isolated from young piglets in the united states and zimbabwe, respectively. the distribution of fimbriae types may vary for different geographical regions. fairbrother et al.  <cit>  also reported that etec serogroup o <dig> is often associated with the f <dig> fimbriae and these strains typically caused pwd in australia and oedema in europe. the detection of hemolysins of vtec was also evaluated using molecular and phenotypic methods revealing the presence of α-hly but not e-hly. the presence of α-hly may serve as a virulence factor for our local vtec isolates as it codes for pore forming cytolysins  <cit> , which are capable of destroying red blood cells  <cit> .

the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria in the poultry farming industry, including the piggeries is of public health concern as transmission of these bacteria to humans via the food-chain and direct contact has been described  <cit> . however, the prophylactic use of antimicrobials was justified by a study which demonstrated that the withdrawal of animal growth-promoting antimicrobials from feeds was associated with elevated prevalence of diarrhea, weight loss and increased fatality rate of post-weaning pigs mainly due to e. coli infections  <cit> . in this study, all vtec isolated were multidrug-resistant, in which high resistance rates were observed for amp, aml, cip, enr, tet, sxt, chl and nal . this is similar to recent reports from thailand and korea  <cit> . this suggests that the swine farms in those countries may have used the similar antimicrobials for prophylactics as the swine farms in malaysia.

pfge, which is known for its discriminatory power as a molecular typing tool in epidemiologic studies revealed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> vtec isolates shared an indistinguishable pulsotype, which was further supported by rep-pcr. in addition, these  <dig> vtec isolates also shared identical seropathotypes, i.e., o139:h <dig> vt2e/ α-hly/ f <dig> and antimicrobial resistance profiles . all five isolates were obtained from different pigs raised in the same pen, strongly suggesting that the transmission of the e. coli clone among the animals have occurred, and this transmission may occur via direct contact , contaminated aerosols  <cit>  or other mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, vtec was the only pathogenic e. coli identified among the pigs sampled in this study. a clone with serotype o139:h <dig> that is commonly associated with diseased pigs worldwide was found in malaysia. two infrequently encountered vtec serotypes, o130:h <dig> and o168:h <dig> carrying virulence factors were also identified. the vtec isolates were all multidrug resistant and a majority possessed the fimbrial adhesins, f <dig> and hemolysins which may serve as additional virulence factors. more samples should be characterized in any future study to determine the true prevalence of different pathogenic e. coli obtained from malaysian swine populations.
