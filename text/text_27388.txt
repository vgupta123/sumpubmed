BACKGROUND
bacterial communities in the mouth have a significant impact on the general health by either preventing or causing infections. recent data suggest a causative relationship between oral microbiota profiles and specific diseases including periodontitis  <cit> . bacterial species that are more prevalent in healthy subjects as well as those that have higher counts in diseased individuals have been identified. based on an extensive literature review, siqueira and rôças  <cit>  concluded that some oral pathologies may have a polymicrobial aetiology and that different types of infection are represented by various mixed bacterial consortia.

most of the bacteria in saliva are attached to exfoliated human epithelial cells  <cit> . in addition to its clinical importance as a diagnostic indicator of oral cancer  <cit>  and possibly other diseases, the human salivary microbiome may provide insights into human populations structure and migrations. surprisingly, initial studies suggest there is little geographic structure of the human salivary microbiome, although specific bacterial genera e.g. serratia and enterobacter vary significantly across geographic locations  <cit> .

using traditional and molecular approaches, more than  <dig> bacterial species have been identified in the human oral cavity and approximately half of them are not yet cultivated  <cit> . the study of complex oral microbiotas with a classical approach would require new culturing technologies whose development is laborious and intrinsically limited. metagenomics offers an attractive alternative, bypassing the need to culture bacteria. the sequencing of the entire microbiome, used to characterize communities dominated by a small number of species  <cit>  cannot be readily applied for the analysis of highly-complex human microbiota. therefore, high-throughput sequencing of amplified partial 16s rdna sequences of a bacterial community currently provides the best compromise between sequence coverage, analytical speed and experimental costs.

recent studies of oral microbiota using high-throughput sequencing estimated the number of species-level phylotypes between  <dig> and about  <dig>   <cit> . however, these figures were obtained using different sequencing coverage, sampling different anatomical sites and analyzing samples pooled from different number of individuals. therefore, not all of the identified taxa are expected to be present in the same subject and at the same time  <cit> . in the current study, we assessed the inter- and intra-individual variations of salivary microbiota, by means of a culture-independent approach based on the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16s rdna v <dig> region. we compared salivary bacterial communities of five individuals at three time-points using 16s rdna pyrosequencing in order to assess their short-term stability and interindividual differences.

RESULTS
taxonomic analysis of the salivary microbiota
we explored the microbial diversity of the saliva samples from five individuals by targeting the 16s rdna hypervariable v <dig> region. of  <dig>  obtained reads,  <dig>  passed the quality control. they were submitted to the mg-rast server  <cit>  for taxonomic analysis. the blast-based mg-rast analysis with a minimum alignment length of  <dig>  the rdp dataset option and a maximum e-value of 10- <dig> removed  <dig> sequences , leaving  <dig>  sequences which were further analyzed. the majority of removed sequences were identical or nearly-identical to human sequences and two sequences were recognized by the mg-rast as chimeras. one additional sequence was recognized as a putative chimera after multiple sequence alignment .

the ability to identify taxa from class down to the genus level varied between phyla but was relatively high. the proportion of sequences that could be confidently placed at the genus level using mg-rast was 85% for fusobacteria and over 90% for the five other major phyla . for comparison, 16s rdna amplicons were analyzed using the rdp classifier with a 80% confidence level  <cit> . in the rdp-based taxonomic analysis, 64% of sequences assigned to protobacteria were placed at the genus level. for the five other major phyla the taxonomic assignments at the genus level reached over 90% .

estimation of pyrosequencing errors
to get an estimate of the pyrosequencing errors we calculated the potential errors that can be derived from the most abundant sequence in the entire dataset. this 216-nt long sequence, which matches the relevant 16s rdna segment of several species of genus streptococcus exactly, occurred  <dig> times and was found in all samples. then we identified sequences that:  differed from the most frequent sequence by deleting, inserting or changing any single nucleotide and  lacked exact matches in the reference database. as expected, nucleotide substitutions were the rarest error type with  <dig> examples . deletions were more frequent with  <dig> counts , followed by insertions represented by  <dig> sequences , which is similar to the trend observed by huse et al.  <cit> . the longest homopolymer stretch associated with a putative insertion or deletion was a 4t which became 5t . all potential error products represented together  <dig> % of the most abundant sequence. however, this may be an overestimation since the single-read accuracy of pyrosequencing with the gs flx system is  <dig> % and the majority of errors are undercalling or overcalling the length of homopolymeric stretches  <cit> .

the impact of pyrosequencing errors on classification has been shown to be very small: an insertion/deletion rate of 2% would affect classification of  <dig> % reads  <cit> . in line with this observation, all  <dig> single-nucleotide derivatives of the most occurring sequence were  classified using rdp classifier as genus streptococcus with over 98% confidence.

composition and variation of the salivary bacterial community
samples are dominated by seven major phyla . members of firmicutes, proteobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes and candidate division tm <dig> were identified in all samples. fusobacteria and spirochaetes, which had the lowest average frequency, were not found in some samples possibly because they were present under the detection limit of the assay. these  <dig> phyla were also abundant in other oral samples assessed by means of phyloarrays, sequencing of the 16s rdna clones and 16s rdna amplicon pyrosequencing  <cit> . the phyla abundances were  <dig> -100% identical between mg-rast  and rdp classifier . "cyanobacterial" sequences found in two individuals corresponded to plant chloroplast sequences. they were most likely transient "contaminants" of the mouth linked to food intake or exposure to airborne pollen  <cit> . forty-two sequences recognized as bacterial were not placed into any phylum.

the most abundant phylum in each sample was either firmicutes or proteobacteria . in four subjects there was a clear dominance of one of these over the other phylum in the three time-point samples. subject # <dig> had the lowest bacteroidetes content. in subject # <dig>  a low proportion of proteobacteria was associated with a higher abundance of actinobacteria.

a total of  <dig> genera were identified by the mg-rast server . among them  <dig> were neither reported in previous studies of oral microbiotas assessed by high-throughput sequencing  <cit>  nor listed in the human oral microbiome database . for individual samples,  <dig> to 15% of sequences could not be assigned to any of the genera. these sequences, representing  <dig> % of the full dataset, were placed into a total of  <dig> taxa above the genus level. although specific genera varied significantly in frequencies among the same and across different individuals, many had a consistent presence across most samples . fifteen out of  <dig> genera constituted  <dig> to 94% of the total sequences present in different samples. eight genera  were found in the three time points of all subjects. of these eight genera, all except gemella were found previously in microbiomes of all of the three investigated subjects assessed by a pyrosequencing approach  <cit> . between  <dig> and  <dig> genera were present in all three time-points of different individuals. fifty-six genera were relatively rare, occurring at a frequency lower than  <dig> % across all samples.

the dataset was represented by  <dig> phylotypes defined at 100% identity . one 100%-id phylotype was discarded because it was placed more distantly than the standard archaeal methanocaldococcus jannaschii dsm  <dig> outgroup sequence in the muscle alignment-based clustering. the blast and rdp analyses showed that this sequence was obviously chimeric, consisting of two distinct domains. the 5' domain  was assigned to veillonellaceae  whereas the remaining 3' domain  corresponded to lachnospiraceae .

the number of genera in each subject ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and the number of otus defined at 97% identity  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> for the different samples. however, due to different sampling sizes, these figures cannot be readily compared .

a steep slope on the rarefaction curve  suggests that a large fraction of the species richness has not been sampled. the number of 97%-id phylotypes appears to be dependent on the total number of sequences in a given sample. this trend has been lost on the genus-level and higher-taxonomic levels. as shown in figure 4c, the genus-richness was higher in subject # <dig> than in subject # <dig>  although the samples from the latter showed better coverage. of course, the number of phylotypes may be overestimated due to pcr errors, undetected pcr chimeras and sequencing errors  <cit> . on the other hand, inefficient lysis of some bacteria and the presence of sequences deviating from the broad-range 16s rdna primers targets will lead to underestimation of bacterial diversity. chao <dig> richness estimations  were the lowest for samples with lowest coverage. this underestimation of less sampled communities has been observed in other studies  <cit> .

we compared saliva samples from different individuals in terms of the phylogeny of their microbial communities using unifrac, where larger values are assigned to changes in more distant taxa  <cit> . for this purpose, phylotypes including 16s rdna hypervariable positions were defined at 100% identity, i.e. a threshold which is higher than the widely assumed species-level of 97-99%  <cit> . we used this stringent cutoff in order to calculate distances between samples with the highest possible resolution. based on the presence and absence of 100%-id phylotypes , samples from each subject formed distinct clusters . hierarchical clustering of unifrac distances based on phylotypes defined at an identity threshold of 97% resulted in grouping of samples for  <dig> subjects when the alignment of otus <dig> was performed with muscle and included hypervariable positions . however, when hypervariable 16s rdna positions were removed from the analysis of otus <dig>  resulting in otus003-hv with  <dig> comparable positions, samples of only  <dig> subjects were grouped. this removal of hypervariable regions is conducted automatically as part of the alignment procedure of the rdp alignment algorithm  <cit> , which allows for tidy comparison of sequences with the same number of positions, but also may eliminate valuable information. distances between samples were also subject to principal coordinates analysis  based on the presence/absence of 100%-id phylotypes  or including their abundance . the results of the pcoa show that samples from the same subject formed clusters with generally little overlap and that samples from different subjects were better separated using unweighted unifrac.

we also investigated whether the samples could be grouped based on sequences of individual phyla. we constructed phylogenetic trees from the sequences for each of the  <dig> phyla identified across all samples . individual samples were then clustered within each of the five trees using the unweighted unifrac method. the results presented in figure 5a show that intrapersonal differences were globally smaller than interpersonal ones for all examined phyla except tm <dig>  of all phyla, bacteroidetes were the best indicator of intraindividual similarity over time; the three time points of four subjects and two of one subject grouped closely. when bacterial communities were compared based on sequences of each of the six individual orders present in all samples, the best clustering by subject was found for clostridiales .

different clustering patterns were obtained for different taxon-specific sequences. samples from subjects # <dig> and # <dig> formed distinct clusters in 4/ <dig> phylum-specific datasets. samples from subject # <dig> were also grouped in 6/ <dig> analyzed order subsets  which suggests the high stability of the microbiota in this individual. taken together, these results indicate that the rate of oral microbiota changes differs between taxonomic groups of bacteria as well as between individuals.

common and subject-specific taxa
analysis of the gastro-intestinal microbiota revealed the existence of a "universal core" consisting of species present in all  individuals and "individual core" representing the stable colonizers in a single subject  <cit> . to explore this concept, we calculated the frequency of all taxa and searched for those that were detected in all time points of all individuals and those that were shared between all time points of some  individuals but absent in all time-points of other individuals . the proportion of taxa belonging to the universal core decreased when moving from the higher taxonomic level  down to 100%-id phylotypes, whereas the frequency of subject-specific taxa were more stable across the different taxonomic levels . the universal core was represented by  <dig> % of distinct sequences and  <dig> % of otus <dig>  which corresponds to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the full dataset, respectively. the number of subject-specific phylotypes, calculated at 100% identity, was 4-fold higher than at the 97% identity. therefore, the interindividual diversity includes the presence of subject-specific phylotypes which are not detected using a 97%-id phylotype identity cutoff. for instance,  <dig> 100%-id phylotypes belonging to genus veillonella were shared in all time points of  <dig> to  <dig> subjects, whereas no 97%-id phylotypes of this genus were found to be subject-specific. however, we cannot exclude that some low-abundance subject-specific 100%-id phylotypes identified were due to sequence errors. in view of the possibility that different subject may be preferentially colonized by different strains of the same species, studies looking to understand the variation in human oral microbiotas may benefit from an identity cutoff greater than 97% in the formation of otus. studies of microbial diversity in the ocean have also used phylotypes that are defined more stringently, with 100% identity, and found that rare organisms are more useful for clustering members from similar communities than more abundant phyla, although they found that this was true both for the 100%-id phylotypes and a less stringent ~94%-phylotype  <cit> .

taxa found in the three time-point samples of all subjects are designated as common. subject-specific taxa correspond to those found in the three time-point samples from some subjects and absent in the three time-point samples from the others. taxa  were identified using mg-rast with a minimum alignment length of  <dig>  the rdp dataset option and a maximum e-value of 10- <dig>  <cit> . otus <dig> were defined using cd-hit  <cit> , and include the hypervariable regions.

firmicutes, which are generally the most abundant in the oral metagenome, also have the highest numbers of both universal core and subject-specific phylotype representatives . representatives of the class sphingobacteria, order sphingobacteriales and family clostridiaceae were found only in subject # <dig>  in the three time points from subject # <dig>  sphingobacteria had a frequency of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %. therefore, sphingobacteria may be temporal colonizers of susceptible individuals. sequences corresponding to family peptostreptococcaceae were detected in all samples except those from subject # <dig>  the only subject-specific genus was olsenella. this genus, found only in subject  <dig>  is diverse, encompassing five different otus <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the salivary bacterial community comparisons using unifrac revealed that samples from the same individual were clustered, i.e. the salivary microbial community appeared to be stable over at least  <dig> days. including samples from more distant time points  performed for three subjects confirmed subject-specific grouping. moreover, our results show that within the same subject, samples taken at closer time intervals were not necessarily more similar than samples obtained across longer sampling times. these results point to the persistence of subject-specific taxa whose frequency fluctuates between the time points. because of its relative stability, salivary microbiota may be potentially applied as an alternative or complementary approach in forensics for person identification, as it has been recently proposed for skin bacterial communities  <cit> .

recently, costello et al.  <cit>  showed that whole-body bacterial communities may be perfectly clustered by host. the three-month time point samples share many taxa, and the oral microbiota are less variable than other investigated body sites. indeed, in another study twenty-six percent of distinct sequences were shared in oral microbiomes when single samples of three unrelated individuals were compared  <cit> .

although the present study did not reach a stable value for phylotype richness, several universal core taxa were identified and putative subject-specific taxa were proposed. a deeper sample coverage is expected to increase the number of universal core taxa whereas the effect on subject-specific taxa frequency remains more difficult to predict: a richer sampling depth may reveal new subject-specific taxa members, and some of those defined in this study may no longer appear specific to a given individual or group of individuals. the fact that the same genera are not uniformly considered as universal core members across different studies shows that the metagenomic studies of oral microbiota require larger-scale high-throughput approaches to better define their individual and universal core.

although the stringent phylotype identity level cutoff of 100% inflates diversity estimates due to pyrosequencing errors  <cit>  it may, as shown in this study, lead to a better clustering of samples by subject than a 97%-id phylotype-based approach which includes the removal of hypervariable 16s rdna regions. applying the latter procedure  some of the sample diversity is masked. therefore, the impact of the sequence alignment procedure and the identity threshold used for phylotype grouping on clustering of bacterial communities may depend not only on the frequency of sequencing errors but also on the bacterial community composition.

factors influencing the oral microbiota composition include age, gender, dietary habits, smoking, oral hygiene, use of antibiotics and, probably, genetic factors. since salivary microbiota analysis revealed subject-specific grouping over time, it will greatly benefit the field to conduct a long-term survey of a large number of subjects in order to provide insight into the impact of different factors and the dynamics of the microbiota changes. improvements in high-throughput sequencing techniques, including longer and more accurate reads, will enable better classification of bacteria. direct metagenome sequencing without a pcr amplification step will eventually provide a less biased measure of the microbial diversity.
