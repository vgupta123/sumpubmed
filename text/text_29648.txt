BACKGROUND
daily patterns of physiological and behavioral processes can be observed in almost all organisms, ranging from cyan bacterium to humans. the circadian clock plays important roles in local and systemic physiology and in pathology
 <cit> . the molecular machinery of the circadian clock is thought to be composed of self-sustaining transcriptional feedback loops. the core proteins of the molecular pathway regulating the circadian clock are clock and bmal1
 <cit> , which form heterodimers that drive the transcription of circadian output genes 
 <cit> . the disruption of the expression of these two core molecules leads to remarkable changes in the circadian clock. the mutation of the clock gene  or the deletion of the bmal <dig> gene  abolishes circadian oscillations
 <cit> . however, clock knock-out mice exhibit a normal physiological rhythm because of compensation by npas2
 <cit> . ccgs, such as per and cry, can weaken the transcriptional activity of clock/bmal <dig> heterodimers, forming a negative feedback loop called the core loop
 <cit> . rev-erbα and rorα bind to an ror element in the promoter of bmal <dig>  inhibiting or activating its transcription, respectively, which is called the stabilizing loop
 <cit> .

micrornas  are small non-coding rna molecules that regulate the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level. the roles of mirnas in the circadian clock have been discussed in several reports. xu et al. showed that the levels of specific mirnas  oscillate in the mouse retina in a circadian pattern
 <cit> . clock-controlled mir- <dig> acts in the fine tuning of the length of the circadian period, and light-induced mir- <dig> was shown to be a negative regulator of the light-dependent resetting of the clock
 <cit> . the mir-192/ <dig> cluster was identified as a potent inhibitor of the per gene family, the enforced expression of which leads to an altered circadian rhythm
 <cit> . kadener et al. found that a mirna, the developmental regulator bantam, plays a role in the core circadian pacemaker by targeting clock in drosophila <cit> . in addition, mir- <dig> was shown to be a regulator of the circadian clock in skeletal muscle
 <cit> . recently, a report showed that mir- <dig> and mir-142-3p, two circulating mirnas, can target the bmal <dig> 3’ utr in mice
 <cit> . thus, mounting evidence suggests that mirnas act as very important regulators of the circadian clock
 <cit> .

we are interested in the mirnas which can directly target the core clock regulators, clock and bmal <dig>  and prediction, followed by experimental validation, was performed to identify potential clock/bmal1-targeting mirnas. the level of clock protein remains nearly unchanged during the circadian cycle
 <cit> , and it can be functionally compensated by npas <dig>  therefore, we focused on the potential bmal1-targeting mirnas. here in this study, we found that mir-142-3p directly targeted bmal <dig> and its expression was regulated by clock/bmal <dig> heterodimers.

RESULTS
mir-142-3p is a bmal1-targeting mirna
by computational prediction using three algorithmic methods , we found two mirnas that putatively target bmal <dig> . these two mirnas  were subjected to validation by luciferase reporter assays using reporters containing the 3’utr of mouse bmal <dig> or human bmal <dig>  the mir-142-pcdna <dig>  and mir-448-pcdna <dig>  expression plasmids were first transfected into 293et cells and the expressions of mature mirnas were verified by quantitative rt-pcr . over-expression of mir- <dig> but not mir- <dig> significantly repressed the activity of the bmal1/bmal <dig> 3’utr-luciferase reporter . we also found that over-expression of mir- <dig> could significantly reduce the luciferase reporter rna levels , suggesting that mir- <dig> was able to accelerate target mrna degradation. because pre-mir- <dig> can produce two mature mirnas  , a luciferase reporter assay was performed to ensure that mir-142-3p was the relevant effector. indeed, the results confirmed that mir-142-3p but not mir-142-5p repressed the bmal1/bmal <dig> 3’utr-luciferase reporter activity .

as there are two mir-142-3p binding sites in the 3’ utr of bmal <dig>  we mutated one or both of them to determine which site was functional, even though the first binding site  is poorly conserved among mammals . in luciferase reporter assays, mutating each of the two mir-142-3p binding sites significantly reduced the repression effect of mir- <dig> over-expression on luciferase activity, and double mutations  showed greater effect than single mutation  . the luciferase activity of  was still decreased by about 30% with mir- <dig> over-expression, which may be ascribed to the background of luciferase reporter experiments for that mir- <dig> over-expression also led to an approximately 25% reduction of luciferase activity of the empty reporter vector  . in gfp reporter assays, we got very similar results that each of the binding site was functional for the interaction between mir-142-3p and bmal13’utr .

mir-142-3p regulates the bmal <dig> mrna and protein levels
to investigate the regulatory effect of mir-142-3p on the expression of endogenous bmal <dig>  we detected the expression level of mir-142-3p and bmal <dig> protein level in six cell lines  generally used in our laboratory. we found that the level of mir-142-3p was extremely high and the protein level of bmal <dig> was low in u87mg cells compared with the other five cell lines. in contrast, nih3t <dig>  293et, mcf- <dig>  t98g and u <dig> cells with low mir-142-3p levels expressed high levels of bmal <dig> protein . to confirm that mir-142-3p can regulate the expression of bmal <dig>  mir-142-3p was over-expressed in the nih3t <dig> and 293et cells or knocked down in u87mg cells, and the mrna and protein levels of human bmal <dig> and mouse bmal <dig> were determined. the over-expression of mir-142-3p led to reductions in the levels of both bmal <dig>  mrna and protein in nih3t <dig>  and 293et cells , and knocking down mir-142-3p with antagomirs increased the expression of bmal <dig> mrna and protein in u87mg cells . these results showed that mir-142-3p could regulate the expression of bmal <dig> by directly targeting its 3’utr.

mir- <dig> expression is under clock control
we have identified mir-142-3p as a potential regulator of bmal1; therefore, it is of interest to explore the possibility that if this bmal1-targeting mirna is under circadian control. in a synchronized nih3t <dig> cell model, we found that the level of mir-142-3p oscillated rhythmically, with the peak levels  phase lagging the crests  of bmal <dig> mrna , suggesting the expression of mir-142-3p might be under circadian control. interestingly, by analyzing the 5’ flank sequence of the mir- <dig> gene we found a conserved canonical e-box  . the results of chip assays showed that clock was able to bind to the e-box directly; the canonical e-box of per <dig> and the upstream sequence of the mir-20a gene were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively .

for further study, a  <dig>  kb upstream regulatory sequence of mir- <dig> gene containing the e-box together with pre-mir- <dig> was then used for a luciferase reporter assay . co-expression of clock and bmal <dig> increased the luciferase activity of p142-luc by approximately  <dig>  fold. mutating the conserved e-box significantly decreased the basal luciferase activity and reduced the induction  of luciferase activity by co-expressing clock and bmal <dig> . besides the conserved canonical e-box, there is an unconserved non-canonical e’-box in the upstream regulatory sequence of mir- <dig> gene which might contribute to the induction of luciferase activity of p142-mt-luc by co-expression of clock and bmal <dig> . the results confirmed that the over-expression of clock and bmal <dig> enhanced the transcription of mir- <dig>  moreover, the simultaneous ectopic expression of clock and bmal <dig>  significantly induced the expression of mir-142-3p in nih3t <dig> cells .

taken together, clock/bmal <dig> heterodimers can bind to the e-box in the upstream regulatory sequence and activate the expression of mir-142; one product of mir- <dig>  mir-142-3p, can act as a negative regulator of bmal <dig> by targeting its 3’ utr. a concise model describing this potential negative feedback loop is shown in figure
5e.

discussion
in this study, we showed that the clock-controlled mir-142-3p can directly target its circadian activator, bmal <dig>  although mir-142-3p has been reported to be a potential bmal1-targeting mirna based on a luciferase reporter assay
 <cit> , the present report is the first confirmation that mir-142-3p can directly regulate the expression of bmal <dig> both in mouse and human cells. by over-expression of mir-142-3p in nih3t <dig> cells, we showed mir-142-3p can regulate the expression of bmal <dig>  however, a further study on the effects of knocking down mir-142-3p in appropriate murine cell models  will help to confirm the relationship between mir-142-3p and its target at the physiological conditions. feedback loops formed by clock genes are thought to be the basis of the molecular clock. to our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting a potential negative feedback loop formed by mirnas and clock genes. considering the important role of bmal <dig> in circadian clock, we speculate that the molecular clock might be also fine tuned by the mirna-mediated negative feedback.

besides bmal <dig>  clock was also predicted to be targeted by several mirnas using three bioinformatic algorithms . the results of our luciferase reporter assay showed that six candidates  could be clock-targeting mirnas . among them, mir- <dig> was reported to be a modulator of clock in a recent study
 <cit> . although we did not perform additional experiments to confirm the interaction between the mirnas and clock, the regulation of clock by mirnas deserves further study. indeed, a similar regulatory network consisting of mirnas and clock may exist, and a feedback loop involving mir-182/ <dig> and clock has been hypothesized
 <cit> .

in our study, we identified mir-142-3p as a regulator of bmal <dig> both in human and mouse cells. even though we showed that mir- <dig> is transcriptionally controlled by clock/bmal <dig> heterodimers only in a mouse fibroblast cell line , the e-box in the upstream regulatory sequence of mir- <dig> gene is perfectly conserved among mammals . thus, we hypothesize that this potential negative feedback mechanism could be conserved, at least between mice and human beings.

in our concise model, clock/bmal <dig> heterodimers enhance the transcription of mir- <dig>  the product of which, in turn, inhibits the expression of bmal <dig>  in addition to bmal <dig>  mir-142-3p was reported to target several genes, including adcy <dig>  whose product controls camp levels
 <cit> . other genes were also predicted to be targets of mir-142-3p , and two of them  are involved in the circadian clock
 <cit> . the other product of mir- <dig>  mir-142-5p, was also predicted to target numerous genes, the most interesting one of which is clock, the other master regulator of the molecular clock . further studies are needed to confirm these prediction results and to uncover the regulatory role of the mir- <dig> gene in the circadian clock.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that mir-142-3p can directly target the 3’utr of bmal <dig>  in addition, the expression of mir-142-3p is controlled by clock/bmal <dig> heterodimers, suggesting a potential negative feedback loop consisting of the mirnas and the core clock genes. these findings open new perspective for studying the molecular mechanism of circadian clock.
