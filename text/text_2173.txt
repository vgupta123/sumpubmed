BACKGROUND
one hundred years ago, a.h. sturtevant
 <cit>  introduced a new concept in genetics, namely the mapping of genes by three-factor test crosses. genes were marked by discrete phenotypic traits, and their order on a chromosome was deduced by their recombination rates. this type of linkage mapping remains the dominant method of determining the arrangement of genes on chromosomes today. phenotypic markers were later replaced by molecular genetic markers to achieve today’s high resolution mapping of large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
 <cit> . advances in molecular genetics and genomics offer an unmatched opportunity for producing genetic maps and extending them to include phenotypic traits of species without prior genomic knowledge. indeed, it has become relatively easy to produce medium- to high-density maps, even for organisms not typically considered to be genetic model systems
. this ability is particularly valuable for species, in which ecologically relevant phenotypes should be linked to the underlying genetics e.g.
 <cit> . this possibility of linking ecologically relevant phenotypes with their underlying genes and genetic architecture has spurred a tremendous amount of research in fields as different as epidemiology, ecology, developmental biology, medicine, agriculture and aquaculture
.

a biological system celebrated for the insights it has enabled in ecology and evolution are the waterfleas of the genus daphnia 
. daphnia are planktonic freshwater crustaceans common in ponds and lakes around the world
 <cit> . their cyclic parthenogenetic mode of reproduction makes it possible to produce genetic crosses among lines and keep clonal lines for many generations, so that the same genotype can be replicated in the lab, which reduces the error variance when testing traits under the same environmental conditions
 <cit> . daphnia have played an important role in elucidating important biological phenomena such as phenotypic plasticity , life history evolution, sexual reproduction, immune defence against parasites, and ecotoxicology
.

two daphnia species of particular interest in the field of environmental genomics, d. magna and d. pulex, have had a number of genetic and genomic tools developed for them, including genome sequences, est libraries, rnai, and transgenesis
. low-resolution linkage maps are also available for these two species
 <cit> , offering some possibility of mapping phenotypic traits. however, these maps are not sufficiently dense to help assemble the daphnia genomes, which still consist of several thousand scaffolds and contigs. thus, while we know more about the ecology of daphnia than any other taxon, comparatively little is known about their genetics. this situation is changing, however, with the recent burst of methods using next generation sequencing of model organisms, which has enabled the development of high-density linkage maps
 <cit> . one method for producing these post-genomics linkage maps is with snp micro arrays, which use fixed sets of predetermined snps in a crossing scheme. the objective of this study was to apply this technique to d. magna, building an snp array-based genetic map of the species and to analyse the genetic basis of quantitative genetic traits. we used an existing, clonally maintained f <dig> qtl panel of d. magna <cit>  and a snp microarray based on snps derived from the f <dig> hybrid clone of the panel.

daphnia populations are known to exhibit marked population divergence, often in line with local adaptation
. predation by fish is a strong agent in selecting for local adaptation and has been shown to lead to shifts of daphnia communities and populations towards smaller daphnia species, reduced body size, earlier maturation and to influence behavioural anti-predator response within species such as increased diel vertical migration
 <cit> . the parent clones used in our qtl f <dig> panel were collected from habitats with strongly divergent ecology: a fishless rock pool in finland and a carp breeding pond in germany, respectively. by mapping the life history and behavioural traits of 193 f <dig> genotypes from these parent clones on the genetic map produced here, we are able to gain insight in the genetic architecture of these traits. we expect to find that alleles from the german parent clone  code for smaller body size and lower reproductive effort, and shift position towards deeper water in the presence of fish kairomones.

methods
daphniaclones and the f <dig> panel
we constructed an f <dig> panel using two parental strains, one from a pond near munich, germany , and the other from a rock pool on a skerry island near tvärminne, finland 
 <cit> ). the munich clone, which does not easily reproduce sexually, was selfed one time, resulting in the iinb <dig> clone, whereas the finnish clone, which reproduces easily sexually, was selfed three times, resulting in the xinb <dig> clone. a xinb <dig> female and an iinb <dig> male were crossed to produce the f <dig> hybrid clone. because sex is environmentally determined in daphnia and they have no sex chromosomes, the same genotype can be either male or female, allowing selfing of genotypes. a single f <dig> clone was maintained as a clonal line and selfed to produce f <dig> offspring, here called the f <dig> panel. the f <dig> panel consisted of  <dig> clones,  <dig> of which belonged to the core panel used for the first generation genetic map
 <cit>  and additional  <dig> clones of which were in an extended panel. all f <dig> clones are maintained as clonal lines and can be used to detect the genetic basis of any trait variation between the two parental clones, or between f <dig> clones.

the d. pulex arenata clone, which was used in the d. pulex genome project
 <cit> , was originally obtained from the indiana university, usa stock centre, but has been kept in the basel university daphnia stock centre since  <dig> by means of asexual reproduction.

handling daphnia species and their parasites does not require specific permissions.

genome size estimation with flow cytometry
we used a detergent-trypsin method for flow cytometric analysis of genome size
 <cit> . prior to the preparation of tissues daphnia females were starved in adam medium
 <cit>  containing sephadex beads. starved females were then washed in few millilitres of stock solution . for each replicate, we homogenized ten females in 350 μl stock solution using a 1 ml-dounce tissue homogenizer with  <dig> strokes . large debris was removed by filtration through a 35 μm mesh nylon sieve. an aliquot of 100 μl of the homogenized tissue suspension was digested by addition of 450 μl of  <dig> % trypsin  for 10 min at room temperature. to prevent further degradation,  <dig> % trypsin inhibitor was added  and the samples were incubated for another 10 min. finally, samples were stained with propidium iodide at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. stained samples were kept for at least 3 h  on ice in the dark. flow cytometric analysis was performed with a facscalibur flow cytometer  at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. propidium iodide emission was measured in the fl2-a channels according to the manufacturer’s instructions. as internal standard of known genome size we used the fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster . briefly, ten female drosophila heads were homogenized in  <dig>  ml stock solution with  <dig> strokes in the dounce homogenizer, and 100 μl of this homogenate was co-prepared with the daphnia samples and stained in exactly the same way. since the diploid peak of d. pulex arenata  strongly overlapped with the dro. melanogaster, it was necessary to use the daphnia magna clones  as a further  standards for d. pulex arenata. all samples  were first analysed separately on the cytometer, to identify the position of the 2c peaks and to determine the approximate concentration of nuclei, and were then measured in combinations. single samples were run until a pre-specified number of  <dig>  events  were reached, typically at a rate ~ <dig> events per second. for combined samples  the number of events was increased to  <dig> . at least five biological replicates were prepared for each daphnia clone. to avoid a bias due to temporal fluctuations in flow cytometer performance, each replicate of the same isolate was measured on a different day . coefficients of variance  of individual peaks typically ranged between  <dig> % and 5% for both drosophila and daphnia. very few measurements had cvs higher than 6%, and those replicates were discarded. conversion from picograms dna to base pairs were made with the factor: 1 pg = <dig> mb
 <cit> .

dna isolation
dna was isolated using the modified ctab  method: ctab homogenization buffer  200 ml; water 160 ml, nacl  <dig>  g,  <dig>  m 2-mercaptoethanol 400 μl, 1 m tris–hcl  20 ml,  <dig>  m na2edta  8 ml and ctab 4 g. about  <dig> adult d. magna animals were placed into a clean  <dig>  ml tube. 200 μl of warm  hb is added immediately. animals were ground and additional 300 μl of hb was added. we incubated at 65°c for 1 hour and added 1 μl of  rnase a. then we incubated at 37°c for 40 minutes. the supernatant was pipetted into a phase-lock gel tube . we proceeded with standard phenol/chloroform extraction.

snp discovery and probe design
the d. magna single nucleotide polymorphism  array was specifically designed to incorporate the  <dig>  scaffolds and  <dig>  contigs from the incomplete draft d. magna assembly v <dig> ,  <dig> . the first step in developing the snp array was to identify snps in the f <dig> clone. f <dig> clone dna was sequenced using single-read illumina sequencing to a coverage depth of  <dig>  . reads were mapped to the d. magna reference assembly and snps detected by using novoalign . we filtered the snps using four criteria: 1) snps that fell into regions outside of one standard deviation from the coverage mean were removed. sites that are underrepresented can provide false positive snp calls, while sites that are overrepresented have the potential to be paralogous. 2) snps that contained average quality or mapping scores less than  <dig> were removed, ensuring snp base call accuracy of 99%. 3) using megablast
 <cit> , the reference contigs were mapped to the reference scaffolds. contigs that contained greater than 80% identity to any scaffold were removed from the analysis. this ensured that the contigs used in the snp array were not misassembled alleles or paralogous from the original reference assembly of the d. magna genome. this procedure resulted in  <dig>  scaffold snps, and  <dig>  contig snps on  <dig> % of the scaffolds and  <dig> % of the contigs.

the  <dig>  snps were passed to roche nimblegen, inc.  which generated forward and reverse probes with each nucleotide combination  for a total of  <dig> , <dig> probes. nimblegen used proprietary software to filter the snps for uniqueness in array development, reducing the number of snps to  <dig> , <dig> scaffold probes and  <dig>  contig probes covering  <dig> % of the scaffolds and  <dig> % of the contigs.

from the complete probe sets , we used the emboss suite
 <cit>  to select for ideal probe conditions of g/c content less than 50% and melting temperature between 55°c and 72°c. for the remaining  <dig> , <dig> scaffold probes and  <dig>  contig probes, we randomly selected one probe set  for each contig and two probe sets  for each scaffold when available. if multiple probes were available for a specific contig or scaffold, we selected the probe that had the highest minor allele frequency . in order to cover the largest scaffolds more thoroughly, we selected from the largest  <dig>  scaffolds an additional marker that was furthest in physical distance from the previously selected marker. this selection process generated  <dig>   scaffold probes and  <dig>   contig probes for a total of  <dig>   probes. the final probe set contained at least one marker on  <dig> %  of the scaffolds and  <dig> %  of the contigs. an additional  <dig> probes of biological interest
 <cit>  were added to the final probe set .

snp array hybridizations
labelled genomic dna was synthesized using a nimblegen dual-color dna labeling kit . the labelling reaction contained 500 ng of gdna and  <dig>  od of cy-labelled random nonamers. this mixture was heat denatured at 98°c for 10 minutes and promptly chilled in an ice water bath. 10 mm dntp mix and 50u of klenow fragments were added to each sample to attain a total reaction volume of 50 μl. the reaction was incubated for 2 h at 37°c, and terminated by the addition of  <dig>  m edta. the product was precipitated in isopropanol, rinsed in cold 80% ethanol, and desiccated using a savant dna  <dig> speedvac concentrator . pellets were resuspended in nuclease free water. cy-labeled product was quantified using a nanodrop nd- <dig> , and 30 μg  labelled product was removed, pooled, and desiccated for subsequent hybridization to the array.

the labelled product was resuspended using sample tracking controls . components from the hybridization kit, ls  were combined to prepare the hybridization solution. this solution was added to each subarray pool for a total volume of 8ul. the product was then denatured at 95°c for five minutes. hybridization was performed on a nimblegen hybridization system  following manufacturer’s guidelines at 42°c for 20–22 hr. the post hybridization wash was conducted using a wash buffer kit . arrays were agitated consecutively in wash buffer i , wash buffer ii , and wash buffer iii . the arrays were dried for one minute using a high-speed microarray centrifuge . image acquisition was attained using the nimblegen ms  <dig> microarray scanner  at 2 μm resolution. photomultiplier tube  gain was adjusted automatically to ensure uniform intensities and acquire the best image for each subarray.

snp filtering
a method of analysing custom nimblegen arrays was developed to predict genotypes for each putative snp on the array. in the first step, spatial smoothing was conducted on the intensity values for each array to reduce within array technical bias following the approach of wang et al.
 <cit>  using  <dig> zones. to evaluate the genotype of each locus, we then calculated a parameter . this index was based on spatially smoothed fluorescent intensities . each homoindex value determined the distribution of four strand-specific oligos, creating a value for each strand independently. the smoothed intensities  for each strand oligo are sorted in decreasing order and used in the homoindex equation.
  

where r <dig> is the highest signal intensity and r <dig> is the lowest. the ideal values of h will be  <dig> for heterozygous loci where two oligos represent the two alleles  have equal signal strength, and zero where there is only a single allele . if the classification for a group of four readings is homozygous, the r <dig> oligo represents the allele  on both chromosomes in the associated strand. if the classification for a group of four readings is heterozygous, the r <dig> and r <dig> oligo represent the two alleles present. default parameters for the homoindex are less than  <dig>  for homozygous loci and greater than  <dig>  for heterozygous loci.

following this step, several filters were applied to identify the loci with the highest and most consistent genotyping. first, the complementary genotypes predicted by the homoindex values both had to predict the same genotype and complementary nucleotide. second, these nucleotides predicted in any f <dig> had to match one or both parental genotypes. any locus that did not meet these criteria was marked as invalid data. third, we required that the array correctly genotypes a given snp as heterozygote in the f <dig> hybrid clone on eight replicate arrays. similarly, we ran replicate arrays on the parental clones and rejected loci that were not correctly genotyped.

after those filters were applied, the homoindices for each snp across all f <dig> clones  were subjected to a dip test for bimodal data distribution
 <cit>  using the r "diptest" package
 <cit> . the dip test step executes two dip tests per snp, one for each strand-specific homoindex. each dip test generates a p-value indicating the strength of the bimodal distribution. p-values less than  <dig>  were passed, and genotypes were passed to the next pipeline step. finally, datasets of f <dig> clones with more than 25% of their genotypes invalid were rejected. in most cases, fresh dna from these f <dig> clones was processed again on the array.

map building
a total of  <dig> clonal lines were used to construct the linkage map. after purging the loci that did not meet our quality criteria,  <dig>  markers remained. all the statistics were done in the r environment , and linkage groups were constructed with the r package r/qtl 
 <cit> . initial marker order was determined with the command "formlinkagegroup" and refined with the command "ripple" with a seven markers window.

life history experiment
we used individual females from a subset of 193 f <dig> clones to conduct an experiment assessing variation in body size and lifetime fecundity. to minimise maternal effects, we began with three independent replicates of each f <dig> clone, using 1- to 3-day-old females that were raised individually in 100-ml jars for two generations. from the third generation, we chose one individual from the third-clutch of each replicate line and followed these individuals until death. each individual was placed in a 100-ml jar filled with daphnia medium . every three days thereafter, we moved the individuals to new jars containing 80-ml of fresh medium and counted the number of offspring produced. we recorded the age at which the first clutch was deposited into the brood pouch and, on day  <dig>  measured body size  under a dissecting microscope.

all generations of animals were maintained in a climate-controlled incubator , with their shelf location regularly shuffled to equalise any positional effects. to meet the increased food requirements of growing daphnia, we upped daily food ratios from  <dig>  ×  <dig> algae cells of scenedesmus obliquus per daphnia on day  <dig>  to  <dig> ×  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> algal cells per animal per day on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

quantification of phototactic behaviour
phototactic behaviour was quantified in the presence and absence of fish kairomones using the experimental set-up described by de meester
 <cit> . briefly, the daphnia clones were cultured under standardized conditions , in either dechlorinated tap water  or in dechlorinated tap water conditioned by fish kairomones. the latter medium was prepared by allowing two ide  to swim in the medium for 24 hours, after which the water was filtered over  <dig>  μm and diluted 10×. the fish were fed daphnia in a separate aquarium so that the medium remained free of alarm pheromones. to quantify phototactic behaviour, we used an experimental glass column . the bottom of the column was covered with small black aquarium pebbles to reduce light reflection, and the column was filled with dechlorinated tap water and positioned in a dark box in a temperature-controlled room . the column was fitted with a 150 w fibre light source, with the end of the fibre positioned 2 cm above the surface of the water. the column was externally marked to indicate three compartments: an upper compartment  12 cm in height, a middle compartment  of 10 cm and a lower compartment  of three cm in height. three to four hours before the experiment, the test animals  were placed in dechlorinated tap water in the culture room to acclimatize to this medium. five minutes before the start of the experiment, the animals were inoculated on the column and placed in the dark box for dark adaptation. after five minutes, the light was turned on. at five minutes and every minute thereafter until the 10th minute, the number of animals in the different compartments was counted. the experiment ended at 10 minutes. the phototactic index was calculated as the number of animals in the upper compartment minus the number of animals in the lower compartment divided by the total number of animals  averaged over the five observations.

qtl mapping
to identify qtl that contribute to variation in life history traits, we performed haley–knott regressions and interval-mapping analyses as implemented in r/qtl
 <cit> . parametric analyses were conducted using a step size of  <dig>  cm, but were cross-validated against a nonparametric approach if deviations from normality were suspected. for each f <dig> clone, the average trait values were used in the linkage mapping. to establish the genome-wide significance level for association between markers and phenotypes, we used  <dig>  permutation tests with significant  and suggestive  qtl identified at lod scores  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. finally, the effect size  and percentage of phenotypic variance explained by each qtl was estimated using the fitqtl() function in r/qtl.

the proportion of phenotypic variation that was explained by daphnia genotype – equivalent to broad-sense heritabilities – was estimated within a bayesian mcmc framework using the r package mcmcglmm . non-informative parameter expanded priors were used for the random effect , and models were run for  <dig>  iterations, with a burn in period of  <dig>  and a sampling interval of  <dig> 

RESULTS
genome size estimation with flow cytometry
the estimates for genome size for d. pulex arenata is  <dig>  pg , corresponding to  <dig> mb , which is close to the estimated  <dig> mb resulting from the genome draft for this species
 <cit> . the estimates for d. magna clones xinb <dig> and iinb <dig> are  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. this corresponds to  <dig> mb  and  <dig> mb , respectively, which is not significantly different , but significantly larger than the genome size of d. pulex arenata . in the following we use the overall mean of  <dig> mb genome size for d. magna.

genetic map
the snp array typing of the f <dig> clones resulted in rather low data quality. as a consequence only 8% of the snp on the array passed our stringent filter criteria. a total of  <dig>  genotypes were successfully typed from 353 f <dig> clones and  <dig>  loci. on average, each of these loci provided usable genotypes for 309 f <dig> clones. all our markers showed detectable linkage to other markers, yielding ten linkage groups ranging in length from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm . the total length of all linkage groups was  <dig> .6 cm . the average interval between the markers was  <dig>  cm, with 95% of all markers within 5 cm of each other, and 71% closer than 1 cm. associations were revealed between regions in the fourth and the eight linkage groups due to known infertility alleles
 <cit>  , which increased the percentage of heterozygous loci  locally and caused high lod scores without the corresponding recombination fractions . these regions showed significant transmission ratio distortions  over a length of about 100 cm, affecting the transmission of many markers on the two linkage groups . in addition to the homozygote deficiencies in these two regions, other substantial parts of the genome showed slight heterozygote deficiencies . overall, trd were detected at 43%   of all snp markers. if we exclude trd due to the homozygote deficiency at the two infertility loci, this number drops to 35% . the overall pattern of trd is identical to the first generation linkage map by routtu et al.

de finetti diagram for genotype frequencies of all snps used for the map. the three large central rings show the significance limits for chi square values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for deviation from hardy weinberg expectations. ideally , all markers would fall inside the rings. snps falling below the centre show a heterozygote deficiency, while snps falling close to the left and the right margin of the triangle show a homozygote deficiency. markers around the two previously mapped infertility loci show strong homozygote deficiency for one of the two parental alleles each, while the majority of the other markers show a slight heterozygote deficiency. genotypes are german , finnish  and heterozygotes .



although the average interval between adjacent markers was  <dig>  cm, part of the markers did not contribute to the resolution of the map due to clustering without recombination events. however, clustered snp markers without recombination still contain valuable information, as each scaffold and contig with a mapped snp marker can be placed in a location to assemble the d. magna genome. the size distribution of the marker interval was strongly skewed with many small intervals and only a few large intervals. intervals >9 cm were found in all linkage groups, with the five largest intervals being 33 cm ,  <dig>  cm ,  <dig>  cm , 16 cm  and  <dig>  cm . many factors could account for these regions, e.g. chance events, artefacts of the mapping procedure, long regions of low sequence complexity in the genome, the selection procedure of the snps, and recombination hot spots. large intervals have also been found in the d. pulex genetic map
 <cit>  and other crustacean maps
 <cit> . on the other hand, each d. magna linkage group had one or two regions with very strong linkage disequilibrium , as indicated by tightly clustered markers. this clustering might be caused by loci that are closely linked physically, but may also indicate regions of reduced recombination around the centromeres. centromeres, but also possible inversions, reduce recombination rates locally, making it difficult to infer the exact positions of markers within these regions
 <cit> .

because the draft d. magna genome  still has many thousands of contigs and scaffolds, it is not possible to compare physical and linkage distance estimates directly, although we can make a rough comparison from the size estimate of the genome. dividing our genome size estimate  by the map length yields an average estimated length of 160 kb/cm, which is slightly longer than the previous estimate of 141 kb/cm for d. magna and the 133 kb/cm for d. pulex.

the vntr markers of the first d. magna map were not used to construct the second generation map. mapping the est based markers from the first generation map
 <cit>  on the new map showed that the sequence of the vntr markers on both maps where largely in agreement with each other .

qtl mapping
infertility alleles
two previously mapped infertility alleles—unviable eggs  and red dwarf 
 <cit> –caused strong homozygote deficiencies among the f <dig> clones. the distribution of these deficiencies allowed a more precise mapping of these loci than was previously possible. ue caused reductions of bb homozygotes, which originate from the finnish mother clone. this deficiency is located on linkage group  <dig> around position  <dig>  cm, with the lowest frequency of bb homozygotes  near a marker snp at position scaffold02065_ <dig>  rd caused a lack of aa homozygotes, which originate from the german father clone. this deficiency is located on linkage group  <dig>  around position  <dig>  cm near a marker snp at contig29432_ <dig>  where not a single aa homozygote was found.

life history traits
to explore the genetic basis of population divergence, in particular with reference to differences in local predation regimes, we characterize body-size, fecundity and age at first clutch for each of the f <dig> clones. body size is largely explained by four loci, mainly additive, each one responsible for between  <dig> and 12% of phenotypic variance . the effect plots for the markers with the highest lod scores show that the finnish alleles are associated with larger body size for three of the four qtls  . the qtl on lg  <dig> shows the opposite pattern, but its contribution to the overall size difference appears small . the overall proportion of genetic variation explained by the daphnia f2-genotypes was 61% for body size, of which only about 42% are explained by the  <dig> qtls .figure  <dig> 
lod scores along the  <dig> linkage groups for variation in a) life history traits and b) phototactic response. life history traits include body size , lifetime offspring production , and age at first clutch . phototactic response characteristics include the phototactic index in the presence of fish , in the absence of fish  and the difference between the two for each genotype . dashed horizontal lines indicate genome-wide thresholds used to identify significant  and suggestive  qtls.

the four main candidate loci for daphnia fecundity  include one additive locus and strong dominance in three loci, with each locus accounting for  <dig> to 15% of phenotypic variance . the effect plots again show that for three of the four peaks the finnish alleles are associated with larger fecundity . the peak at lg  <dig> shows the opposite pattern. the four qtls together explain 42% of the total variance, while the overall proportion of genetic variation explained by the daphnia f2-genotypes was 50% for fecundity . not a single peak was revealed for age at first clutch deposited in the brood pouch . this trait had also the lowest proportion of variation explained by the f2-genotypes .

behavioural traits
we tested for qtl corresponding to vertical position in the water in the presence and absence of fish kairomone and also for the difference in vertical position between these two treatments. the former  resulted in no significant or suggestive peaks, although about 42% of the total variation was explained by the f2-genotypes . the difference between the clonal averages of the positions in the absence and presence of fish , however, resulted in a suggestive peak on lg  <dig> . according to the effect plot, this signal is produced by a smaller change in position by the heterozygote genotypes at this snp marker, while the two homozygotes did not differ.

co-localization of qtls
qtls for fecundity, body size and the behavioural trait did not co-localize with each other. nor did they co-localize with the location of the two infertility loci on lg  <dig> and  <dig> 

discussion
the second generation linkage map of d. magna presented here greatly improves the previous linkage map of this ecological model species and offers help for the ongoing assembly of the d. magna genome project. furthermore, it provides, as shown here, a tool for mapping phenotypic traits. flow cytometry revealed that the genome of the two d. magna clones used here is with about  <dig> mb substantially larger than the genome of d. pulex arenata .

genetic map
two other genetic maps for daphnia have been published: one based on the same mapping panel for d. magna <cit> , the other for d. pulex <cit> . table 
 <dig> summarizes the main differences in the design of these maps and in the parameters derived from them, showing that the map constructed in this current study is by far the largest, both in terms of markers and f <dig> clones used, and that it yields better estimates of map parameters. the first mapping project of the north american d. pulex was able to construct all  <dig> chromosomes expected from cytology 
 <cit> . in contrast, the first d. magna map resulted in  <dig> major and several minor linkage groups. ten groups were expected based on cytological studies of this species
 <cit> . furthermore, both the first generation d. magna and d. pulex maps had high variation in linkage group size . the new d. magna map yielded not only the predicted ten linkage groups, but also confirmed the cytological observation of relatively little variation in the length of the linkage groups/chromosomes . the physical distance estimates of the three daphnia maps are in good agreement with each other .

as was observed in the first generation genetic map of d. magna, we found transmission ratio distortion  in several areas of the linkage map, which caused deviations of expected hw equilibrium in the f <dig> panel . two different mechanisms were responsible for this trd. first, two infertility alleles in the f <dig> clone, originating from each parental genotype, caused the loss of one homozygote each. trd around these two loci could be used to map their position to two different linkage groups in the f <dig> panel. together, they explain about one fifth of all trd. neither of them co-localized with any other qtls found for the traits mapped in this study, although one infertility allele was closely linked with a qtl for resting egg  production in an earlier study
 <cit> . second, trd was also apparent for other snps; however, in these cases it was due to deficiencies of heterozygotes, visible as a clustering of snp markers below the centre in figure 
 <dig>  heterozygote deficiency indicates some degree of f <dig> hybrid breakdown. as the parent clones for our f <dig> panel are from ecologically distinct populations about  <dig>  km apart , it is likely that synergistic epistasis acts on genes in different parts of the genome, influencing the parental phenotypes. co-adapted gene complexes in our f <dig> panel might have been broken down by recombination, leading to a depression in f <dig> fitness and an underrepresentation of heterozygotes among the viable f <dig> clones. while we lost very few f <dig> clones once the f <dig> hatchlings from the sexual eggs started reproduction, we cannot exclude selection during the preceding stages, i.e. survival of embryos in resting eggs, embryonic and juvenile development and maturation, all of which might contribute to outbreeding depression
 <cit> . the heterozygote deficiencies seen at several linkage groups were much less drastic than the homozygote deficiencies caused by the two infertility alleles .

each linkage group showed dense clusters of markers, indicating strong ld . these regions might indicate groups of markers that are tightly linked physically, but may also indicate regions of reduced recombination, as is typical for centromeres. this latter explanation was given for a similar situation in the d. pulex linkage map, where a large number of loci were also found clustered at identical positions
 <cit> . the strong ld close to the putative centromeres makes mapping of phenotypic traits difficult due to lack of recombination in these areas. however, none of the qtls for traits mapped in this or earlier studies using the same mapping panel
 <cit>  fall into these regions.

mapping of life history and behavioural traits
our two parent clones for this mapping panel were collected from a fishless rock pool habitat and a carp breeding pond, respectively. previous studies have reported that d. magna adapts locally to the presence of fish through smaller body size, earlier maturation, and a deeper average position in the water
 <cit> . furthermore, animals from populations with a history of sympatry with fish, are found deeper in the water when exposed to fish kairomone
 <cit> . quantitative genetic studies have revealed significant broad sense heritabilities for these traits
. our phenotypic mapping provides some insight into the genetics of these traits. a pattern consistent with local adaptation is found for body size, where alleles from the fishless finnish rock pool population were mostly associated with larger body size . qtls for higher fecundity  are in agreement with the general finding of higher reproductive effort in populations with fish, but higher fecundity is not consistently associated with daphnia from ponds with fish
 <cit> . we found no strong qtls for the other traits—age at first clutch and position of daphnia in the water column. a potential  qtl was found for changing position in the water when we compared experimental conditions with and without fish kairomone, but the observed phenotypic pattern did not correspond to our expectation of a stronger change associated with alleles from the population from the fish habitat; instead, heterozygote daphnia tended to show the least response.

our failure to find qtls for these traits is not evidence for the absence of genetic variation, as we found for all traits significant genetic variance components among the f <dig> clones . qtl studies are most powerful for phenotypes with strong effects caused by one or few loci, with little sensitivity to environmental variation
 <cit> , which is rarely the case. the absence of significant qtls allows some speculations about the underlying genetic architecture. however, it has to be kept in mind, that with only one clone from each population and data based on a panel from an interpopulation cross, these speculations are rather preliminary. nevertheless, it is clear, that the traits studied here clearly differ in their underlying genetic architecture. for example, the  <dig> % variation explained by the significant qtl detected here for phototactic behaviour  suggests that the genetic effect responsible for this difference stems from multiple genes with small effects. de meester
 <cit>  obtained similar estimates in a clonal repeatability analysis and in an offspring-on-midparent regression upon sexual recombination, suggesting that the genetic variation underlying this trait is largely additive in nature. the emerging picture thus is that this trait may represent a case of additive, polygenic inheritance. in contrast, the two phenotypically distinguishable infertility loci, characterized in a previous study
 <cit> , could be mapped based on the strong transmission ratio distortion caused by the absence of one homozygote class. their underlying genetics is simple: each has one locus with two alleles, with no known environmental contributions and no epistatic interactions. for both loci, we also know that they are polymorphic in the natural populations, as the parent clones are heterozygote
 <cit> . for body size and fecundity, we found a more complex pattern with additive and dominant qtls explaining about 40% of total phenotypic variance, and both traits influenced by multiple qtls scattered throughout the genome. thus, our qtl study revealed traits with strongly differing genetic architecture, ranging from single locus effects with dominance but no inter-locus interactions, to typical quantitative genetic traits with many loci and potential interactions. follow-up studies need to reveal if these genetic architectures also reflect the situation within populations.

the genetic architecture of the traits mapped here appear to be largely independent, and we found no pleiotropic effects, or close physical linkage between loci influencing different traits. our results thus suggest that any genetic correlation between traits across populations, e.g. body size and fecundity, is maintained by the build-up of inter-population linkage disequilibrium between loci, caused by selection.

because the snps used in our genetic map can be located on the d. magna genome draft, it may raise the possibility of fine mapping the qtls on the genome to identify the exact genes responsible for the phenotypic effect. however, the prospects of fine mapping have to be improved. the current d. magna genome draft  still consists of several thousand scaffolds and contigs. the genomic regions of the qtl identified here are, however, more than 10 cm , equal to about  <dig>  mb. this is far larger than the scaffolds and contigs containing the snp markers that describe the location of the qtl. furthermore, the effect sizes of most of the individual qtls  are not strong enough for fine mapping. only the qtl for fecundity on linkage group  <dig> shows a strong effect, but the best marker is located on a scaffold of only  <dig>  kb  . thus, fine mapping is not possible until we have a better genome draft, which would allow us not only to locate more snps in the mapped region, but would also enable a candidate gene approach. increasing the density of our genetic map would also help, although this seems not to be a limiting factor at the moment, as we already have about seven times more genetic markers than recombinant lines. using more recombinant lines would be more likely to substantially improve the mapping statistics. since we used only 193 f <dig> clones for phenotyping, but built the map with 353 f <dig> clones, a first step would be to phenotype the remaining 160 f <dig> clones. alternatively, one could repeat the entire study with a different mapping panel, which would allow us to find the qtls that explain variation in more than one pair of populations and help us fine-map phenotypes by overlapping the qtls from different studies, as has been done for similar cases
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the new genetic map of d. magna presented here only partially fulfilled our aim to produce a high density snp backbone for the assembly of the d. magna genome. with only 8% of the snps resulting in data of sufficient quality for genotype calling, the usefulness for the genome assembly is lower than expected. nevertheless, the number of snps is high enough to significantly help in the assembly of the genome. on the other hand, the map proved a powerful tool to analyse the genetic architecture of several traits segregating in the populations of origin. the spectrum of genetic architectures ranges from single locus traits  to complex traits with variable numbers of qtls and possible interactions among loci. for traits with strong qtl it may be possible in the future to fine map the genes in question.
