BACKGROUND
pluripotent cells, including embryonic stem  cells, embryonic germ cells, and embryonal carcinoma cells, are characterized by their ability to differentiate into all somatic cell types under appropriate conditions  <cit> . accordingly, pluripotency-related genes are kept active in pluripotent cells, and early developmental genes are maintained in a 'poised' state   <cit> . consistent with the wide array of developmental fates, the chromatin in pluripotent cells is also highly adaptable  <cit> . the unique gene expression pattern and chromatin signature in pluripotent cells are controlled by a transcription factor network that involves oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog  <cit> . these three core factors are tightly regulated, and even limited fluctuation in their expression may cause significant changes in cell fate  <cit> . in es cells, the pluripotency-related genes have relatively high levels of the active histone mark h3k4me <dig> in their chromatin. in contrast, the chromatin that contains poised developmental genes is associated with a combination of h3k4me <dig> and repressive h3k27me <dig> marks  <cit> . many histone methyltransferases have been proven to be important for normal embryogenesis  <cit> . nevertheless, how histone methylation participates in the maintenance of pluripotency and coordinates the precise expression of the core transcription factors remains largely unknown.

p <dig> pluripotent cell line is derived from mouse embryonal carcinoma that has the ability to contribute to many normal embryonic tissues after blastocyst infection  <cit> . when exposed to nontoxic concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide  in culture conditions, p <dig> cells can differentiate into muscle cells. when induced with all trans-retinoic acid , they can be directed into neuronal lineage cells  <cit> . adox indirectly inhibits s-adenosylmethionine -dependent methyl-transfer by inhibiting the hydrolysis of the by-product s-adenosylhomocysteine  <cit> . adox has been broadly used for the functional analysis of protein methylation  <cit> . it has been shown that adox treatment during ra induction interferes with the neuronal differentiation of p <dig> cells  <cit> .

here, we show that pre-treatment of adox blocks ra-induced p <dig> cell neuronal differentiation. the impact of adox on the expression of pluripotency genes was investigated. we found that in contrast to decreased oct3/ <dig>  the expression of other key pluripotency-related genes is elevated or unchanged in p <dig> cells treated with adox. we then specifically examined the opposing effects of adox on the expression of nanog and oct3/ <dig>  which were supported by the differential repressive histone methylation of these genes. these results provide an example on the differential control of pluripotency-related genes by histone methylation in p <dig> cells.

RESULTS
adox reduces the neuronal lineage potential of p <dig> cells
to explore whether adox affects the maintenance of pluripotency, we examined the neuronal differentiation potential of adox-treated p <dig> cells. p <dig> cells were pre-treated with adox for  <dig> day and then induced by ra as shown in figure 1a. our data showed that adox pre-treated cells neither aggregated by day  <dig> nor formed neuron-like networks by day  <dig>  in contrast to adox-null ra-treated control cells . furthermore, immunostaining showed that adox significantly reduced the expression of neuron-specific tubulin-isotype Î²-tubulin iii  in ra-induced p <dig> cells . in contrast to the almost three quarters of ra-induced cells that express tuj <dig> protein and have extended neurites, only 8% of adox-treated cells were tuj1-positive, and they had fewer neurites . similar results demonstrating the inhibitory effects of adox on ra-induced expression of tuj <dig> were obtained by western blotting . the reduction of tuj <dig> was dependent on the dosage of adox . next, we investigated whether the neuronal differentiation program can be initiated by adox pre-treatment. the hierarchical expression of the transcription factors ngn <dig>  mash <dig>  and neurod is essential for neuronal fate determination  <cit> . we found that the ra-induced expression of these early neuronal transcription factors was remarkably reduced or completely abolished at the mrna level in the presence of adox . these results indicated that the potential for neuronal fate is severely reduced in adox-pretreated p <dig> cells.

the impact of adox on the expression of pluripotency-related genes in p <dig> cells
it is important to determine whether the effect of adox is correlated with the maintenance of pluripotency. we thus examined the expression of pluripotency-related factors, including oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, fgf <dig>  utf <dig>  and lin <dig>  the analysis showed that oct3/ <dig> mrna was reduced, which is consistent with the reduced differentiation potential. unexpectedly, sox <dig>  nanog, and fgf <dig> were markedly up-regulated after adox treatment . as a control for the pluripotency-related genes, we examined the impact of adox on the mrna expression of three germ layer-marker genes as well , because these genes are maintained in a 'poised' state in pluripotent cells that are expressed only when the three layers are established during early embryonic development  <cit> . the mrna levels of almost all of these genes in p <dig> cells increased with adox treatment, whereas the mrna level of nestin, an ectoderm marker, did not obviously change. collectively, these data show that the expression pattern of pluripotency-related genes is disordered in adox-treated p <dig> cells and that early development-related genes are released from their poised states

adox has opposite effects on the expression of nanog and oct3/4
next, we focused on the differential regulation of pluripotency-related genes by adox. we examined the protein expression of the core transcription factors oct3/ <dig> and nanog. adox-induced changes in the protein levels of nanog and oct3/ <dig> were similar to those observed at the mrna level . reporter plasmids driven by the nanog  and oct3/ <dig>  promoters were then used to confirm the effects of adox. it has been reported that these two reporter plasmids can recapitulate the endogenous expression of nanog and oct3/ <dig>  <cit> . we found that the reporter activity driven by the nanog promoter was increased, whereas that of oct3/ <dig> was reduced in adox-treated p <dig> cells . because they are consistent with the measured mrna levels, the promoter activity data suggest that adox has opposite effects on the transcription of the nanog and oct3/ <dig> genes.

impact of adox on the occupation of histone h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> on the nanog and oct3/ <dig> genes
methylation of histone h <dig>  including h3k27me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  and h3k9me <dig>  is usually associated with the gene repression. we next examined the global effects of adox on these repressive methylation marks and found that adox reduced the level of h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  but not h3k9me <dig>  in p <dig> cells . to examine whether the nanog and oct3/ <dig> promoters are associated with repressive methylation marks, chip assays were carried out for h3k27me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  and h3k9me <dig> on five genomic sites that were indicated on the nanog and oct3/ <dig> genes . the chip data revealed that all three repressive marks were significantly reduced around the nanog gene after adox treatment , but none were affected in the oct3/ <dig> gene . this result suggested that the adox-mediated reduction in repressive methylation marks on the nanog gene  is correlated with the differential regulation of these two major pluripotency-related genes by adox in p <dig> cells.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrate that adox affects the maintenance of pluripotency in p <dig> cells. among the pluripotency-related genes, nanog and oct3/ <dig> are differentially regulated by adox, and their regulation is correlated with a differential reduction in repressive histone methylation marks in these genes.

the sam-dependent methyltransferase substrates include lipids, nucleic acids, and a variety of proteins  <cit> . the effects of adox may be universal. after treatment of p <dig> cells with adox, we observed that in addition to the aberrant pluripotent gene expression pattern, adox blocked the cell cycle, changed the cell shape and induced expression of the adhesive molecule e-cadherin . all of these effects may have contributed to the loss of neuronal potential. in addition, the nonspecific release of early developmental genes may also have disturbed the potential for neuronal fate in p <dig> cells.

in this study, we examined the expression of six pluripotency-associated genes in p <dig> cells and their changes in response to adox treatment. utf <dig> and lin <dig> were not responsive to adox. in contrast, sox <dig>  nanog, and fgf <dig> showed higher expression levels following adox treatment, whereas the expression of oct3/ <dig> was reduced. nanog, oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> are all critical transcription factors for pluripotency maintenance, and sox <dig> functions to maintain the identity of neuronal progenitors, suggesting that the core pluripotency transcription factors perform distinct roles during embryonic development  <cit> . recently, it was reported that sox <dig> and oct3/ <dig> have opposite effects in defining mesendoderm and neural ectoderm  <cit> . we found that nanog and oct3/ <dig> were differentially regulated by adox, which suggests that they are controlled by different mechanisms. consistent with this finding, nanog and oct3/ <dig> play non-overlapping roles in the establishment of the primitive endoderm and the epiblast  <cit> . these clues led us to study the histone methylation of these two genes.

to maintain pluripotency, the crucial pluripotency transcription factors are maintained at relatively high but precisely controlled levels  <cit> . in es cells, the localized chromatin regions of poised developmental genes have both the active histone mark h3k4me <dig> and the repressive h3k27me <dig> mark, whereas the pluripotency-related genes are mainly occupied by relatively high levels of h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . however, we found repressive histone methylation marks at pluripotency-related genes at low levels, implying that they potentially have a role in the modulation of pluripotency-related genes. the expression of nanog in es cells requires the histone demethylase jmjd2c to antagonize the repressive h3k9me <dig>  <cit> . our chip data revealed that adox treatment preferentially causes decreased levels of the three repressive histone methylation marks h3k9me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  and h3k27me <dig> on the 5' proximal region of the nanog gene, whereas it has no effects on the oct3/ <dig> gene. in other words, the repressive histone methylations are more involved in the regulation of nanog than in the regulation of oct3/ <dig> in p <dig> cells. as reported previously, both nanog and oct3/ <dig> are under the control of very similar composite sox-oct elements consisting of neighboring binding sites for sox <dig> and oct3/ <dig>  <cit> . these observations raised interesting questions: how is the differential regulation of nanog and oct3/ <dig> achieved? is the underlying mechanism related to functional differences between nanog and oct3/4? we expect that further investigations in the fields of es cells and developing embryos would confirm our results and answer the above questions. because adox may also influence the active histone methylation marks, the methylation of dna and on non-histone proteins  <cit> , more specific manipulations on the relevant histone methyltransferases would indeed helpful in elucidating the differential regulation of nanog and oct3/ <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the expression of nanog and oct3/ <dig> are differentially regulated by adox, with the repressive histone marks reduced only on the nanog gene. these data shed light on the critical role of histone methylation in the maintenance of pluripotency and the determination of cell fate in pluripotent cells.
