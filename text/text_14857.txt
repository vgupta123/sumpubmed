BACKGROUND
in plants, the nac  family of transcription factors  is one of the largest plant tf gene families. the gene family is estimated to comprise  <dig> members in arabidopsis thaliana and  <dig> and  <dig> respectively in rice and poplar  <cit> . the nac gene family in conifers appears to be at least as large as in arabidopsis and might possibly even be expanded  <cit> . the boreal forest in the northern hemisphere is dominated by conifers, many of which are economically and ecologically important. still, relatively little is known about how conifers, and other gymnosperms, sense and respond to abiotic and biotic stress. general knowledge about inducible defence responses and their regulatory pathways are primarily derived from studies in angiosperm model plants, which in some cases can be extrapolated to gymnosperm systems , despite their evolutionary divergence  <cit> . a recent study showed that the accumulation of flavonoids and the gene induction pattern in the flavonoid pathway correlated to the level of resistance in norway spruce to the root rot fungus heterobasidion annosum  bref. sensu lato   <cit> . h. annosum s.l. is a complex of five closely related species  <cit>  that have partly overlapping host ranges. these results indicated a differential control of defence responses between resistant and susceptible genotypes.

nac tfs were first identified in forward genetic screens as key regulators of developmental processes . nac proteins have been shown to regulate central developmental processes such as embryo patterning and vascular patterning in both angiosperms and gymnosperms . however, nac proteins are also one of the most important groups of differentially regulated tfs in plant defence . nac tfs commonly possess a conserved dna-binding nac domain at the n-terminus, which includes nearly  <dig> amino acids that are divided into five subdomains   <cit> . the c-terminal regions of nac proteins are highly divergent  <cit>  and confer the regulatory specificity of transcriptional activation  <cit> . based on the phylogeny of and domain structure in the nac proteins it is possible to structure and organize the functional specificities of the conserved nac domains and the divergent c-termini  <cit> . the nac subgroups, e.g. subgroup iii- <dig> in arabidopsis, which contains the stress-related nac proteins, anac <dig>  anac <dig>  anac <dig>  ataf <dig> and ataf <dig>  have common unique c-terminal motifs dominated by a negatively charged matrix with a few conserved bulky and hydrophobic amino acid residues that form the transactivation domains  <cit> . this group of paralogous arabidopsis nac genes show co-expression in response to stress hormones  <cit>  and several members are known to act as regulators of plant responses to abiotic  <cit>  and biotic  <cit>  stressors. transgenic plants overexpressing members of this subgroup  show increased susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens such as botrytis cinerea or fusarium oxysporum  <cit>  while an anac <dig> anac <dig> double mutation  <cit>  or expression of an ataf <dig> repressor construct  <cit>  lead to enhanced resistance against b. cinerea. taken together, this suggests that subgroup iii- <dig> nac transcription factors may be important transcriptional integrators between biotic and abiotic stress. a number of nac tfs with similarity to arabidopsis subgroup iii- <dig> nacs among the differentially regulated tfs in recent transcriptome studies of spruce responses to biotic stress  <cit>  indicate that spruce orthologs of well-characterized arabidopsis nacs control similar programmes in spruce and arabidopsis not only in plant development  <cit>  but also in plant responses to stress.

the aims of this study were to: i) analyse the classification and stress-induced expression pattern of h. annosum s.l.-induced norway spruce nac tfs; ii) investigate the downstream target genes of panac <dig> in norway spruce; iii) investigate if panac <dig> had the capacity to regulate the promoter palar <dig>  a gene in the downstream regulation module. to address the first aim we queried sequence databases to identify homologous sequences, identified the modular structure and phylogenetic placement of h. annosum s.l.-induced norway spruce nacs. we also determined the expression patterns of the h. annosum s.l.-induced nac tfs in response to different stressors. to investigate downstream target genes of panac <dig> norway spruce cell lines overexpressing panac <dig> were constructed and their transcriptome was compared with the wild-type norway spruce cell line to identify misregulated genes. to address our last aim we isolated the promoter of palar <dig> and fused it to the gus reporter gene and performed transactivation studies of panac <dig> and palar <dig> in nicotiana benthamiana.

methods
sequence search and phylogeny
six putatively unique transcripts  with similarity to angiosperm nac transcription factors  identified in previous rnaseq experiments  <cit>  were used to query the norway spruce genome portal  using blastn  <cit>  and tair  and genbank using blastx. the significant hits were downloaded and nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments were made with picea sequences from genbank and p. abies  <dig>   <cit> . for phylogenetic analysis of the identified norway spruce nac genes additional norway spruce gene models were downloaded from the norway spruce genome portal and subgroup iii- <dig>  iii- <dig> and iii- <dig> arabidopsis nac amino acid sequences were downloaded from tair. the sequences were trimmed to the conserved n-terminal region and aligned with the clustal w algorithm in mega  <dig>   <cit> . phylogenetic trees were created using the neighbor-joining algorithm in the same program with  <dig> bootstrap values, p-distance estimations as a statistical model, uniform substitution rates and an estimation based on partial sequences with a cutoff value of 95%.table  <dig> norway spruce subgroup iii- <dig> nac genes and their closest homolog in arabidopsis thaliana

predicted subgroup iii- <dig> norway spruce nac protein sequences were inspected for presence of a conserved n-terminal  <cit>  and c-terminal domains  <cit> . the charge and hydrophobicity of the predicted proteins were estimated with emboss pepinfo software  <cit> , the hydrophobicity of the predicted amino acid sequences was plotted using kyte & doolittles hydrophobicity index with a window of  <dig> amino acids. sequence identity and similarity analysis of the full length and c-terminal regions of the identified norway spruce nac proteins was performed with the ident and sim functions of the sequence manipulation suite  <cit> .

determination of gene expression patterns
biotic and abiotic stress
thirty-year-old trees of eight independent norway spruce genotypes which are part of a swedish clonal forestry program and grow in a stand situated at Årdala, sweden,   <cit>  were inoculated with h. annosum s.l. the inoculation and sampling procedures are described in detail in danielsson et al.  <cit> : briefly, three ramets per genotype and two roots per ramet were used in the experiment. on one root, a wooden plug colonized by h. annosum s.s.   <cit>  was attached to an artificial wound on the root surface with parafilm; the other root was wounded only and sealed with parafilm. phloem samples  for rna extraction were harvested at the start of the experiment  and at  <dig> and 15 days post inoculation  and preserved in rnalater  for subsequent rna extraction.

total rna was isolated according to chang et al.  <cit> . poly  + rna was purified and amplified using messageampiii . purified amplified rna  from each genotype were reverse transcribed with the iscript™ cdna synthesis kit . the cdna synthesis was diluted 1: <dig> in deionized water. each genotype was used as an independent biological replicate.

plant stress hormone treatments
to analyse the response of candidate genes to stress hormones and compare it to the response to h. annosum s.l., two-week-old norway spruce seedlings  were transferred under axenic conditions to petri plates with filter paper , moistened with fertilized liquid media  <cit>  and treated homogenized heterobasidion parviporum . for treatments with methyl jasmonate  or methyl salicylate  as previously described by arnerup et al.  <cit> . every treatment was performed in triplicate. after 72 h, seedlings were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c until further use. total rna was isolated according to chang et al.  <cit>  after dnase i treatment one μg of total rna was reverse transcribed with the iscript™ cdna synthesis kit .

somatic embryo maturation treatment
samples for analysis of panac <dig> expression levels during embryo development, was a generous gift from drs. irena molina and malin abrahamsson. briefly, samples were collected from five sequential developmental stages : +pgr  five days after subculture), —pgr , ee ; le <dig> and le <dig> . three independent samples were collected for every stage and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c until extraction. total rna were extracted with the spectrum plant total rna kit  after dnase i treatment one μg of total rna was reverse transcribed with the quanta cdna synthesis kit .

quantitative reverse-transcribed pcr 
for analyses of gene expression levels an aliquot of cdna equivalent to 25 ng of rna was used per 20 μl of pcr reaction using ssofast evagreen supermix  and a final concentration of  <dig>  μm of each primer. primers were designed using primer <dig> software  with a melting temperature  between 58 °c and 60 °c, and amplicon length between  <dig> and 183 bp . the thermal-cycling condition parameters, run on an iq™ <dig> multicolor real-time pcr detection system , were as follows: 95 °c for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95 °c for 5 s,  <dig> or 60 °c for 20 s. each run was followed by a melt curve analysis to validate the specificity of the reaction. a linear plasmid standard curve was used to measure the pcr efficiency in each of the experiments, and primer pairs with efficiency lower than 95% were discarded. two technical replicates were prepared for each sample.

the relative expression was calculated using the 2ΔΔct-method  <cit> , transcript abundance was normalized to the reference genes phosphoglucomutase  <cit> , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4a   <cit>  and elongation factor 1-α   <cit> . the stability of reference gene expression was assessed with the bestkeeper tool separately for every experiment  <cit> . differential expression between treatments were tested with kruskal-wallis- and mann–whitney u-tests using the graphpad prism <dig> software .

transformation of norway spruce
full-length cdna sequences of panac <dig> were obtained by amplification with the specific primers panac03fl , designed based on comparison of full-length or partial sequences of p. abies, p. glauca and p. sitchensis homologues, from a pool of cdna from norway spruce bark inoculated with h. annosum s.l. for the pcr reaction we used dream-taq polymerase . attb <dig> and attb <dig> adapters were added to the 1148 bp product by pcr using dream-taq polymerase. the resulting pcr product was recombined into the pdonr/zeo  vector followed by lr recombination into pmdc <dig> vector  <cit> . the resulting vector was verified by test-digestion and sequencing.

cell lines constitutively expressing panac <dig> were established by agrobacterium-mediated transformation of norway spruce somatic embryogenic cell line 95:61: <dig>  as described by minina et al.  <cit> . in brief, pmdc32:: panac <dig> and pmdc32:: gus  <cit>  was transformed into the agrobacterium tumefaciens c58c <dig> strain with the additional virulence plasmid ptok <dig>  transformed bacteria were then grown overnight with the appropriate selection and collected by centrifugation and resuspended in infiltration buffer  to an od <dig> of  <dig>  seven days old norway spruce suspension cultures and agrobacterium was mixed in a 5: <dig> ratio and acetosyringone was added to a final concentration of 150 μm. the co-cultivation was allowed to proceed for 4 h. thereafter the cells were plated on a filter paper placed on the top of solidified proliferation medium with pgr  <cit>  and incubated at room temperature in the darkness for 48 h. then, filters were transferred on solidified proliferation medium with pgr containing 400 μg ml− <dig> timentin and 250 μg ml− <dig> cefotaxime and incubated under the same conditions for  <dig> days. subsequently, filter papers were transferred onto fresh solidified proliferation medium with pgr containing 20 μg ml− <dig> hygromycin, 400 μg ml− <dig> timentin, and 250 μg ml− <dig> cefotaxime and subcultured onto fresh medium every week. the transgenic calli were picked from the plates after a month and transferred to solidified proliferation medium with pgr containing 20 μg ml− <dig> hygromycin, 400 μg ml− <dig> timentin, and 250 μg ml− <dig> cefotaxime. transgenic lines were maintained on proliferation medium with pgr and 20 μg ml− <dig> hygromycin.

nine transgenic lines were selected for dna and rna extraction for verification of the insert and expression levels respectively. to verify the transformation, dna was extracted by homogenizing and boiling a 3–5 mm diameter callus in an eppendorf tube in 20 μl  <dig>  m sodium hydroxide at 95 °c, quickly centrifuging and diluting 5 μl of the supernatant in 495 μl 10 mm tris–hcl ph  <dig>  five μl of the dilution was used in a 25 μl pcr reaction using dreamtaq  and hyg primers .

total rna was extracted by using a modified ctab extraction protocol  <cit> . after dnase i treatment  cdna was synthesised from 1 μg of total rna using the iscript cdna synthesis kit . expression levels of panac <dig> was tested by qrt-pcr by using an iq <dig> multicolor real-time pcr detection system  and ssofast evagreen supermix  as stated previously and two independent lines  with expression levels  <dig>  times higher than the wt cell line were selected for maturation initiation, rna sequencing and chemical analysis. the initiation of somatic embryo maturation in the overexpression lines and the control line was done according to the protocol described by filonova et al.  <cit> , briefly for each line pre-weighed pieces of callus was placed on half strength lp medium for a week before the explants were transferred onto the maturation medium, the maturation response was scored after four and six weeks on maturation medium, embryos resembling the le <dig>  me <dig> and me <dig> stages  <cit>  were noted.

transcriptome profiling of panac <dig> overexpression lines
rna extraction and illumina sequencing
the two selected overexpression  lines,  <dig>  and  <dig> , along with the wt line  were incubated on solidified proliferation medium with pgr at room temperature in the darkness for six days and approx. 7 mm diameter large calli were picked from the lines and frozen in liquid nitrogen. the samples were ground in a mortar in liquid nitrogen and extracted by using the rneasy plant mini kit  using the rlt buffer and following the manufacturer’s instructions, thereafter the samples were treated with dnase i . three biological replicates per line were used for illumina sequencing. the rna integrity was analysed by using the agilent rna  <dig> nano kit . sequencing libraries were prepared at the snp&seq technology platform  using the truseq stranded mrna sample preparation kit according to the manual truseq stranded mrna sample preparation guide. sequencing was done using hiseq  <dig>  paired-end 125 bp read length, v <dig> sequencing chemistry.

filtering, mapping and differential expression
the raw sequences were filtered by a nesoni clip for the read pairs using nesoni  <dig>   . to enable alignments to a reference database we constructed a bowtie reference from the ‘trinity contaminant free’ dataset downloaded from the norway spruce genome portal  using bowtie <dig> version  <dig> . <dig> . the clipped read pairs were aligned to trinity using tophat version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the resulting alignment files from tophat were provided to cufflinks version  <dig> . <dig> to produce an assembly for each sample. the assemblies were then merged using cuffmerge . we then applied the newer workflow by running cuffquant  that calculates transcript abundances from the single assembly file and the aligned read files produced by the tophat run which was run separately for each sample. differential expression analysis was performed with cuffdiff  <cit> .

chemical analysis of norway spruce overexpression lines
norway spruce oe lines  overexpressing the panac <dig> gene and the wild-type cell line 95:61: <dig> were grown in liquid proliferation medium without pgr for two weeks. thereafter, the cells were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen after which the samples were freeze-dried. the freeze-dried samples were ground using a ball mill. once pulverized, the sample-weight was noted. specialised metabolite content was assessed with the method described by hammerbacher et al.  <cit> .

transactivation of ppalar <dig> by panac03
palar <dig> transactivation by panac03
the palar <dig> promoter has two allelic forms, palar3a and palar3b. both were amplified from genomic dna using ppalar3a and ppalar3b primer sets . after amplification, they were cloned into pjet <dig>  plasmids using the clonejet pcr cloning kit . from this plasmid, pcr products were amplified with the ppalar3a_ <dig> and ppalar3b_ <dig> primer sets . these two pcr products were subsequently cloned into the destination plasmid pcf <dig> which was adapted from the pga <dig> vector used for agrobacterium transformation  <cit>  by overlap extension pcr. to be able to do so, the destination plasmid was amplified into two separate pcr products. for the first pcr fragment the primers teta <dig> forward and puv <dig> reverse were used and for the second pcr fragment gus forward and teta <dig> reverse were used . all the pcr product fragments were purified with the genejet pcr purification kit  as instructed by the manufacturer’s protocol. the promoter fragments were separately combined with these destination fragments and amplified in a three fragment overlap extension pcr using the method from  with the adaptation pcr protocol: initial denaturation at 98 °c for 2 min, followed by three cycles of denaturation at 98 °c for 15 s, annealing at 60 °c for 2 min and elongation at 72 °c for 5 min, then 14 cycles of denaturation at 98 °c for 15 s, annealing at 60 °c for 30 s, elongation at 72 °c for 5 min, then the final elongation at 72 °c for 10 min. single mutations  in the palar3a promoter were created by two fragment overlap extension pcr. mut_xbai_f or mut_kpni_f were combined with the teta2_reverse primer to make the first fragment and mut_xbai_r or mut_kpni_r were combined with teta <dig> forward for the second fragment. the two corresponding fragments were combined in an oepcr with the same pcr conditions as described above. a double mutation was created by using mut_xbai_kpni primers with the corresponding teta <dig> primers and the same method was repeated.

the newly formed plasmids were isolated with dpni restriction endonuclease  <cit> . the restriction mix was incubated at 37 °c for 15 min and deactivated at 80 °c for 5 min. 1 μl of dpni treated oe-pcr product was transformed into chemically component e. coli cells  and shake incubated for a minimum of 3 h at 37 °c. colony pcr screen was performed with screening primers . positive clones were selected on agar plates with tetracycline , and plasmids were isolated with the genejet plamid miniprep kit . transformation of agrobacterium tumefaciens  was done with the heat-thaw method as described  <cit> . cells were plated on agar plates with tetracycline , kanamycin  and rifampicin  and transformants were selected with colony pcr using the same primers as for e.coli.

the transactivation experiment is an adapted version of the one described in . four to six weeks old nicotiana bethaminiana plants were grown under a 16-h photoperiod at 23 °c. infiltration occurred as described in . the following 1: <dig> mixes of a. tumefaciens harboring the different effector and reporter constructs were prepared. after 72 h, leaf disks were taken and gus expression and total protein were measured. the gus colorimetric assay was described in a protocol in wilson et. al.  <cit>  where 20 μl of cleared extract were added to 250 μl gus assay buffer as well as to gus assay buffer with 6 mm 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucuronide . the reaction was incubated overnight covered in aluminum foil. od405nm was measured in a microplate reader of the type fluostar optima. the gus activity was determined in mol pnp per minute and gram protein. the protein concentration was determined by the bio-rad protein assay  <cit> . student t-tests were performed to calculate significant changes based on 6– <dig> biological replicates per measurement.

RESULTS
norway spruce contain multiple clade iii-3nac transcription factor gene family members
the rnaseq dataset from the time course study of h. annosum s.s. inoculated norway spruce  <cit>  contained six putatively unique transcripts  with similarity to nac tfs, all puts had at least one blastn hit in the p. abies genome v <dig>  high confidence gene catalogue. three of the puts, named panac <dig>  panac <dig> and panac <dig>  all had highly significant blastn hits to unique gene models in the p. abies v <dig>  gene catalogue and significant blastx hits to arabidopsis nacs . panac <dig>  panac <dig> and panac <dig> all had homologs among clade iii- <dig> nacs in arabidopsis. a query of the p. abies genome v <dig>  gene catalogue and a phylogenetic analysis of norway spruce, rice, poplar and arabidopsis protein sequences show that the norway spruce genome has at least seven nac gene models  which fall within subgroup iii- <dig> described by jensen et al.  <cit> . we essentially see four clades within subgroup iii- <dig>  the predicted amino acid sequence of six of these genes, including panac03- panac <dig>  form a sister group to a clade with members from all angiosperm species including anac <dig>  ataf <dig>  ataf <dig>  anac <dig>  the norway spruce clade and two other clades, one of them specific to rice, are distinctly separated from the anac <dig>  anac <dig>  anac <dig>  pnac <dig> and pnac <dig> protein sequences . the six sequences in the norway spruce clade share a higher amino acid similarity with each other than with ma_75192p <dig>  which clusters closer to the anac <dig>  anac <dig>  anac <dig>  pnac <dig> and pnac <dig> branch .fig.  <dig> neighbour-joining tree of subgroup iii- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nac family transcription factors in norway spruce and arabidopsis. neighbour-joining tree based on the predicted amino acid sequence of the identified clade iii- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nac family transcription factors in norway spruce gene models in p.abies  <dig>  and the iii- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nac family transcription factors reported by jensen and co-workers  <cit>  namely at1g <dig>  , at1g <dig>  , at5g <dig> , at5g <dig> , at4g <dig>  , at1g <dig> , at3g <dig> , at1g <dig> , at3g <dig> , at1g <dig> , at2g <dig>  and at5g <dig> . poplar and rice sequences producing significant hits to norway spruce clade iii- <dig> nac proteins: xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>   and xp_ <dig>  . the norway spruce sequences are represented by their gene model number. black filled circles indicate subgroup iii- <dig> norway spruce genes for which there are both a gene model and a stress induced put available as indicated in the tree, grey filled circles indicate genes for which there exist only a partial put. open squares indicate subgroup iii- <dig> norway spruce gene models for which there is no stress induced put available. bootstrap values  are presented on the relevant nodes





panac <dig> , panac <dig> , and panac <dig>  correspond to isogroup <dig>  isogroup <dig> and isogroup <dig> respectively  identified in the time course study of the norway spruce’s transcriptional responses to h. annosum s.s.  <cit> . the predicted proteins from panac <dig> and panac <dig> share a maximum of 81% identity and 90% similarity in the conserved n- terminal domains and 59% similarity over the complete predicted protein sequence . the two sequences cluster closely in the phylogeny together with three other potential nac genes, all highly similar . the third expressed norway spruce clade iii- <dig> like nac, panac <dig>  clusters outside this group of highly similar nac sequences  and the protein share approximately 40% identity on amino acid level with the panac <dig> and panac <dig> proteins.

the conserved n-terminal a-e motifs  <cit>  were present in all the identified norway spruce nacs . the c- terminal region is highly conserved between panac <dig>  ma_103386p <dig> and ma_86256p <dig> and is dominated by polar and charged amino acids . panac <dig> share a common c-terminal motif  qssfrle, additional file 4) with all norway spruce clade iii- <dig> nacs except panac <dig>  the c- terminal motifs in norway spruce subgroup iii- <dig> nacs are different from the negatively charged matrix with a few conserved bulky and hydrophobic amino acid residues in arabidopsis subgroup iii- <dig> nacs  <cit> .

pathogen-induced expression of clade iii-3-like norway spruce nacs
we selected panac <dig> and panac <dig> for expression analysis as representatives of nacs responding to both wounding and inoculation  and of nacs primarily responding to inoculation  in the time course study of norway spruce transcriptional responses to h. annosum s.s.  <cit> , as these puts were the most highly expressed in either category. the qrt-pcr analysis showed that panac <dig> is significantly induced in response to both inoculation and wounding treatments  compared to the control although the induction level was significantly higher after inoculation compared to wounding at  <dig> dpi  . panac <dig> was significantly induced at  <dig> dpi both after wounding and inoculation with h. annosum s.s.  compared to the control. the qrt-pcr data also showed that panac <dig> transcript levels were significantly higher after inoculation compared to the wounding treatment at  <dig> dpi  . the responsiveness of panac <dig> and panac <dig> to h. parviporum inoculation or to plant defence hormones  was tested in young seedlings. both genes were significantly induced in response to meja and mesa treatments  but only panac <dig> was significantly induced in response to fungal inoculation .fig.  <dig> expression pattern of nac genes in bark of mature norway spruce trees. the relative expression levels over the control, determined with qrt-pcr, of  panac <dig>  and  panac <dig>  in response to wounding and inoculation with h. annosum s.s. at  <dig> and 15 days after inoculation. the standard error  is shown for time point and treatment. superscript letters indicate significant differences between treatments

panac <dig> overexpression in norway spruce leads to altered developmental and metabolite profiles
panac <dig> overexpression lines show abnormal embryo development
eight selected hygromycin-resistant lines were verified to be transformed with pmdc32:: panac <dig>  five of these lines were shown to moderately overexpress panac <dig>   <dig> - <dig>  times the wt line . in the wt line, panac <dig> expression is at, or below, the detection limit during early embryo development and no truly quantifiable expression was detected until le <dig>  . two oe lines,  <dig>  and  <dig> , expressing panac <dig> at equal levels  were tested for maturation capacity with a standard maturation protocol  <cit>  . both lines formed distinct embryonal masses in response to aba treatment albeit at a lower frequency than the wt line . however, the embryonal masses appeared to lack a normal protoderm and rarely developed into normal mature embryos . thus, the proliferating oe lines  <dig>  and  <dig>  and the wt, were selected for transcriptome and metabolite profiling . a small number of mature embryos with a reduced number of/or fused cotyledons, were obtained from the oe lines . the embryos from the oe lines showed a normal germination response after a standard desiccation treatment  <cit> , but a significantly smaller fraction of the germinated embryos showed epicotyl formation and growth .fig.  <dig> 
panac <dig> overexpression lines lack normal protoderm and display a disturbed maturation response. embryonal mass formation per gram of proliferating tissue, the asterisk indicate significantly differences in embryonal mass formation between control  . photos taken after six and eight weeks  on maturation medium for the overexpression lines panac03_ <dig>  and panac03_ <dig> , expressing panac <dig> at equal levels , and the wild type represented by the pmdc32-gus transformed wt line 95:61: <dig>  scale bar corresponds to 2 mm. black arrowheads indicate developing embryos. germination  and epicotyl growth  one and two months after transfer to germination medium  in wt and the two oe lines, superscript letters indicate significant differences between treatments 




a limited number of consistently misregulated genes are found in the overexpression lines
the transcriptomes of the panac <dig> oe lines and the wt line were sequenced with illumina hiseq sequencing generating  <dig> - <dig>  m reads per sample that passed illumina’s chastity filter and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  m read pairs were kept after nesoni filtering . the overall read mapping rate from tophat was 28–63% where most samples had around 60% mapping .

the analysis of the rna-seq data-set showed that compared to the wt line  <dig>  and  <dig>  had  <dig> and  <dig> differentially regulated genes respectively, and  <dig> genes were consistently misregulated in both oe-lines . of these,  <dig> were consistently up-regulated in both  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig> were consistently down-regulated in both oe lines . the down-stream analyses of the transcriptome data focussed on these consistently misregulated genes to understand the impact of panac <dig> oe on norway spruce gene expression patterns.fig.  <dig> venn diagram identifying the  <dig> consistently misregulated norway spruce gene models in panac <dig> oe-lines. up  <dig>   are the upregulated genes in panac <dig> oe-line  <dig> , up  <dig>   are the upregulated genes in panac <dig> oe-line  <dig>  and the intercept between them comprises the  <dig> consistently upregulated genes. similarly down  <dig>   are the downregulated genes in oe-line  <dig>  and down  <dig>   are the downregulated genes in oe-line  <dig>  and the intercept between them comprises the  <dig> consistently downregulated genes




a fischer exact test  of the go terms associated with the genes consistently upregulated in panac <dig> oe lines indicated that genes associated with the gene ontology  categories such as cell wall macromolecule biosynthetic process , carbohydrate metabolic process , hemicellulose metabolic process  and developmental process  were overrepresented among the consistently up-regulated genes  compared to the dataset as a whole. two of the five most highly upregulated gene models encode homeodomain proteins, ma_122121g <dig> and ma_114226g <dig>  which are potentially connected to developmental patterning in norway spruce  a third homeodomain protein, ma_10427484g <dig>  was also found among the consistently upregulated genes. ma_122121p <dig> is related to pahb <dig> and the arabidopsis gene glabra <dig>  and was the most strongly and consistently upregulated gene model, as it was upregulated approximately  <dig> times compared to wild type. ma_114226g <dig> encodes a protein with very high similarity to pakn <dig> .

the consistently down regulated genes in panac <dig> oe lines associated with the go categories: protein folding , metabolic process , response to light stimulus , response to abiotic stimulus , response to stress  and response to hydrogen peroxide  . again, the most strongly regulated gene in the consistently down regulated domain was a gene model, ma_10251997g <dig>  with similarity to the arabidopsis transcription factor kanadi  . four peroxidases associated with the go term go: <dig> were down regulated in the oe lines, three of these were class iii peroxidases ma_195910g <dig> , ma_195775g <dig>  and ma_185755g <dig>  .

interestingly, three key genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were concomitantly down-regulated in the panac <dig> oe-lines: a chalcone synthase, ma_10359605g <dig>  homologous to the arabidopsis gene transparent testa  <dig> , a flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase  a possible homologue to the arabidopsis gene transparent testa  <dig>  and the previously described palar <dig> gene   <cit>  . we only detected one consistently induced gene associated within the phenylpropanoid pathway, ma_10429470g <dig>  which encodes an isoflavone reductase with similarity to at4g <dig> which might be involved in lignin biosynthesis.

given the concomitant down-regulation of norway spruce homologs to key genes in the flavonoid pathway, we analysed the levels of specific specialized metabolites in the panac <dig> oe-lines namely of the major stilbenes, the immediate catalytic products of palar <dig>  catechin and gallocatechin, and finally a number of flavonoids. the major stilbene in norway spruce, astringin, showed no significant differences between the wt and the panac <dig> oe-lines, neither did the flavonoids kaempferol or isorhamnetin . however the levels of naringenin, apigenin, eriodictyol and catechin, gallocatechin and their dimers were all lower in oe-line  <dig>   and line  <dig>   .fig.  <dig> down-regulation of flavan-3-ol in panac <dig> oe-lines. quantification of flavonoids in the wt line 95:61: <dig> and the panac <dig> oe-lines  <dig>  and  <dig>  after two weeks culture. the flavonoids were quantified according to hammerbacher et al.   superscript letters indicate significant differences 




panac <dig> does not suppress the activity of the palar <dig> promoter
one of the consistently down regulated genes  has been thoroughly studied before  <cit>  and the promoters from two different alleles, palar3a and palar3b, have been isolated, the promoters show a high over all similarity and they differ primarily by two indel-regions present in the palar3a promoter only, containing two putative nac binding sites . the wt line, 95:61: <dig>  used in this experiment is homozygous for the palar3a allele , thus we hypothesized that panac <dig> repressed palar3a , and possibly also ma_10359605g <dig> and ma_10434709g <dig>  by direct interaction with the promoter of these genes. to test this hypothesis, the palar3a and palar3b promoters were cloned into a gus reporter vector and were used in a transactivation experiment in n. bethamiana leaves with and without panac <dig>  the basal activity of the promoters and effect of panac <dig> on these promoters were quantified. the basal expression of the palar3a and palar3b promoters was similar . however, co-expression of panac <dig> strongly activated the palar3a promoter  but did not affect the activity of the palar3b promoter , showing a different interaction of panac <dig> with the two promoters.fig.  <dig> transactivation of palar <dig> promoters by panac <dig>  figure a, transactivation of native palar3a  and palar3b promoters  by panac <dig> in n. benthamiana, the figure shows the results from one of three representative experiments . figure b shows one representative transactivation experiment with native palar3a  and palar3a_mut promoters  by panac <dig> in n. benthamiana . the mean +/− se is indicated for each measurement. asterisks indicate significant differences * = p <  <dig> ; ** = p <  <dig> ; *** = p <  <dig>  




to investigate if the two putative nac binding sites in the indel-region unique to the palar3a promoter  were the targets for panac <dig> causing the specific activation of the palar3a promoter we mutated these sites constructing promoter ppalar3a_mut. the mutated promoter was cloned into the gus reporter vector. thereafter panac <dig> was co-expressed with either ppalar3a_mut or the native ppalar3a in n. bethamiana leaves. interestingly the basal activity of ppalar3a_mut was higher than that of the native palar3a promoter  showing that these putative nac binding sites can affect palar3a expression, the deletion of the nac binding sites did however not affect the transactivation of ppalar3a by panac <dig>  there was no significant difference in relative activity of ppalar3a_mut  or the native ppalar3a .

discussion
in this study we identified seven gene models in the norway spruce genome assembly v  <dig>  that show homology to the stress-induced subgroup iii- <dig> nacs in arabidopsis  <cit> . generally, the norway spruce subgroup iii- <dig> nac gene family members are highly similar displaying the conserved n-terminal a-e motifs characterizing nac domain proteins  <cit>  and also a relatively conserved c-terminal region including a conserved c-terminal motif sekee  qssfrle, a motif present also in most sequences amplified with the marker sb <dig>  <cit> . the conserved c-terminal region in norway spruce subgroup iii- <dig> members is different from the c-terminal motifs arabidopsis subgroup iii- <dig> members and likely the norway spruce members do not have a transactivation domain similar to the arabidopsis members  <cit> , and it is unclear if the function of norway spruce subgroup iii- <dig> nac is similar to that of arabidopsis subgroup iii- <dig> members. the norway spruce subgroup iii- <dig> nacs share, at least partly, an element of stress inducibility with the arabidopsis members based on the expression data available in the norway spruce genome portal. three of the norway spruce subgroup iii- <dig> gene models were identical to the puts panac <dig>  panac <dig> and panac <dig> from a de novo transcriptome assembly of the interaction between norway spruce and h. annosum s.s.  <cit> . a fourth gene model, ma_86256p <dig>  showed similarity to another put. taken together, it shows that certain norway spruce subgroup iii- <dig> nacs, like their arabidopsis orthologs, respond to biotic stress. interestingly, the biotic stress responsive gene models to  cluster together in the phylogeny with ma_103386p <dig> and ma_64687p <dig>  which do not respond to h. annosum s.l. inoculation, forming a sister group to the arabidopsis anac <dig>  ataf <dig>  ataf <dig> and anac <dig> proteins and to a group of rice nac genes known to respond to abiotic stress  <cit> . this differentiation in terms of expression pattern between norway spruce paralogs is consistent with the concept of subfunctionalization  <cit> .

to confirm the responsiveness to biotic and abiotic stress, the expression of panac <dig> and panac <dig> was analysed in response to h. annosum s.s. infection or wounding in phloem of mature norway spruce trees by qrt-pcr. both genes showed significant induction in response to either treatment, but as previously reported for other norway spruce genes,  <cit> , the induction was higher after inoculation than after wounding. however only panac <dig> transcription was significantly induced in response to h. parviporum treatment. this discrepancy seen in the induction patterns of panac <dig> between experiments could be an effect of several different factors; obviously different organs of conifers show different transcriptional responses to pathogens in seedlings, the responses appears to be more organ-specific than pathogen-specific  <cit>  suggesting that the organ analysed, phloem versus seedling roots, could explain the differential induction between panac <dig> and panac <dig>  furthermore, the age of the host is another factor which may affect the manifested defence responses in conifers. the two fungal species, h. annosum s.s. and h. parviporum, are known to have different host preferences  and different capacity to produce phytotoxins  <cit> , suggesting that their interaction with the host may differ and could lead to a differential regulation of panac <dig>  however, in our previous studies confronting norway spruce plants of different ages with h. parviporum and h. annosum s.s.  <cit>  we have seen consistent induction of defence related genes with the two different fungal species over different age classes and tissues tested. thus, the gene induction patterns could indicate that panac <dig> is likely to have a closer association with the transcriptional responses to biotic stress in norway spruce than panac <dig>  therefore we selected panac <dig> for functional analysis by overexpression in somatic embryogenic cultures.

the overall plan of embryo development is similar in angiosperms and gymnosperms despite their separation approximately  <dig> million years ago. there are, however, several distinct differences in the embryo development programme between the two plant lineages. in angiosperms the first tissue to differentiate during embryogenesis is the protoderm which is formed by periclinal divisions of cells of the early globular embryo  <cit> . the formation of the protoderm, which restricts cell expansion, is essential for the remaining developmental process  <cit> . in contrast, in gymnosperms the surface layer of the embryonal mass divides both periclinally and anticlinally. nevertheless, the outer cell layer in the embryonal mass in norway spruce embryos defines a functional protoderm  <cit> . the developing embryonal masses in the panac <dig> oe-lines masses appeared to lack the normal conifer “protoderm” i.e. a smooth outer surface, the ruggedness of the embryo surface were reminiscent of the phenotype of other transgenic norway spruce lines with a disturbed protoderm formation  <cit> . the embryonal masses did generally not develop into mature cotelydonary embryos. a small number of mature, but aberrant looking, embryos were recovered from the oe-lines. these embryos showed a normal germination response but a significantly smaller fraction of the germinated embryos showed epicotyl formation and growth. based on these observations we concluded that the embryo development programme is disturbed at a very early stage in the panac <dig> oe-lines.

among the  <dig> consistently misregulated gene models identified by transcriptome sequencing of the two panac <dig> oe-lines we found a number of genes known to control various aspects of patterning and embryo development in norway spruce. the most strongly induced gene model is ma_122121g <dig> which encodes a hd-zip iv protein highly similar to pahb <dig>  <cit>  and the arabidopsis genes glabra  <dig> and anthocyaninless <dig>  <cit>  associated with patterning in norway spruce and arabidopsis while pahb <dig>  controlling protoderm formation  <cit> , was slightly down regulated in the oe lines. pahb <dig> is not expressed during early embryo development in wt-lines  <cit>  and neither is ma_122121g <dig>  thus, the misregulation of ma_122121g <dig> may be the cause of the aberrant embryo morphology in the oe-lines. other strongly upregulated gene models in the oe-lines with potential to cause of the aberrant embryo morphology encode hbk <dig> , papin <dig>  and paact <dig> , which all have been shown to control norway spruce somatic embryo development , and specifically the differentiation of the shoot apical meristem and cotyledons  <cit>  processes which appears to be affected in the panac <dig> oe lines. a gene model  with similarity to the arabidopsis gene kanadi <dig>  shows a three-fold lower expression in the panac <dig> oe-lines. in arabidopsis embryos kanadi <dig> is initially expressed in the central domain protoderm at the late globular embryo stage and appears to have a role in specifying the peripheral identity in the developing arabidopsis embryo in interplay with hd-zip iii proteins . it may be noteworthy that, as mentioned before, papin <dig> and also a norway spruce hd-zip iii gene model  with similarity to athb <dig>  and appears to show contrasting induction levels compared to the kanadi-like gene in oe-lines; these expression patterns are reminiscent of the interaction between the kanadi <dig>  hd-zip iii and pin <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . taken together the maturation and rna-seq data indicates that ectopic expression of panac <dig> interferes with the protoderm formation and early embryo patterning through misregulation of transcriptional modules controlling these processes. this pleiotropic effect must be taken into consideration when further examining the consistently misregulated genes in panac <dig> oe-lines as any gene misregulation may be an effect of the aberrant early embryo development.

about two thirds of the consistently misregulated genes were consistently repressed in the overexpression lines. the consistently repressed genes more commonly associated go terms related to response to abiotic stimuli, stress responses and responses to hydrogen peroxide. there were three consistently down regulated class iii peroxidases, including paprx <dig>  among the consistently misregulated genes. previously, paprx <dig> has been shown to respond to h. parviporum treatments in norway spruce cultures  <cit>  and it is suggested to contribute to h2o <dig> production in suspension cultures of norway spruce, indicating a potential role of panac <dig> in redox homeostasis under stress in norway spruce as h. parviporum treatments in norway spruce cultures appears to repress several peroxidases  <cit> .

we observed consistent misregulation of three key genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in the overexpression lines, a chs homologous to the arabidopsis thaliana gene transparent testa  <dig> , one f3’h homologus to the arabidopsis gene transparent testa  <dig>  and the previously described palar <dig> gene  <cit> . variation in the palar <dig> locus associated with enhanced resistance to h. parviporum and with increased accumulation of the catalytic product of the enzyme  catechin  <cit> .

the concomitant misregulation of key genes in the flavan-3-ol pathway is associated with reduced levels of flavan-3-ols in the oe-lines; both naringenin and apigenin, which are products formed downstream of chs but before steps catalysed by either f3’h or palar <dig> were down regulated in the panac <dig> overexpression lines . eriodictyol, a catalytic product of f3’h was also reduced. the catalytic product of palar <dig>  -catechin, was also significantly reduced in the oe lines. while other metabolites not directly associated with flavan-3-ol production accumulated to the same levels as in the wt line, showing that the down regulation of key members in the flavan-3-ol pathway lead to a specific reduction in these compounds. although regulation of anthocyanin or proanthocyanin pathways by nac tfs is not commonly reported in literature. the nac tfs bl, controlling the blood red flesh phenotype in peach, and anac <dig> in arabidopsis appear to control certain members of the anthocyanin or proanthocyanin pathways  <cit> . the metabolite and transcriptome profiling of the oe lines appeared to indicate that panac <dig> could act as a negative regulator of 3-flavanol production in norway spruce, possibly by acting directly on the misregulated flavonoid biosynthesis genes. to test this possibility we co-expressed panac <dig> with the promoter of either of the two alleles at the palar <dig> locus  <cit>  in n. bethamiana leaves; hypothesising that panac <dig> would reduce palar <dig> promoter activity if it acts as a repressor. however, in this system panac <dig> strongly activated the promoter of the palar3a allele suggesting that panac <dig> does not act as a negative regulator of flavan-3-ol production by direct interaction with palar <dig>  however, the down-regulation of chs transcription, encoding the rate-limiting step in flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit>  might have had an effect on substrate availability for downstream metabolite biosynthesis, explaining the lower transcriptional and metabolite levels observed in our study. transcript profiling also showed an up-regulation of an isoflavone reductase gene that could be involved in lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . lignan and lignin biosynthesis directly compete for substrates used in the flavonoid pathway and might therefore also negatively regulate flavonoid biosynthesis, as has been observed in our panac <dig> over-expressing lines. it is possible that the down-regulation of chs, f3’h and palar <dig> genes in panac <dig> overexpressing lines could be mediated by another factor such as misregulation of an upstream regulatory gene or the interference of constitutive panac <dig> expression with early embryo patterning. it should be noted that flavanols and the transparent testa mutants has been linked to auxin homeostasis and polar auxin transport  <cit>  in plants. another possible explanation to the discrepancy between the overexpression and transactivation experiments is that panac <dig> act in a heterodimer, as has been shown for other stress-responsive nacs  <cit> , with a currently unidentified tf to downregulate the chs, f3’h and palar <dig> genes in the oe-lines. this possibility could be tested by yeast two-hybrid screening of cdna libraries from embryogenic cultures using panac <dig> as a bait.

CONCLUSIONS

panac <dig> and its orthologs form a sister group to well characterized stress-related angiosperm nac genes and at least panac <dig> is responsive to biotic stress and appear to act in the control of defence associated secondary metabolite production. however, the unexpected embryo phenotype of the panac <dig> oe lines emphasizes the still enigmatic connection between specialized metabolism and patterning in plants, raising questions on the role of subgroup iii- <dig> nac tfs in development and embryo patterning.
