BACKGROUND
with next generation sequencing  technologies, sequencing costs have been reduced by over  <dig>  times during the past ten years  <cit>  thereby opening new opportunities for genome sequencing of model plants and crops  <cit> . the sequencing strategy and the quality of the genome sequence assembly depend on the objectives of the analysis and the complexity of the target genome   <cit> . whole genome shotgun  and clone-by-clone strategies have been used separately or in combination to obtain plant genome sequences  <cit> . the main advantage of a clone-based approach compared to wgs is that it facilitates the accurate assembly of regions harboring multigene families and transposable elements  that are repeated at the genome level but not at the clone level  <cit> . such sequences collapse into single contigs in wgs assemblies, particularly when data are obtained using the ngs short read technologies, and therefore biologically relevant information is lost. moreover, the physical maps that are constructed for the clone-based approach enable direct links between the sequence and genetic maps carrying genes and quantitative trait loci  of interest thereby enhancing the value of the genome sequence for breeders. for these reasons, the clone-by-clone approach remains a gold standard for sequencing species that contain a high level of repetitive elements and are of economic interest such as maize and wheat   <cit> .

sequencing projects using a clone-by-clone approach require the availability of a robust physical map, i.e. an ordered list of contiguous overlapping large inserts cloned into a vector ). different methodologies including hybridization, sequenced tag site mapping, and fingerprinting with restriction enzymes  <cit>  have been employed to build physical maps. fingerprinting has been commonly used in the past decades to build physical maps of animal and plant reference genomes  and to complete the maize physical map  <cit> .

a high quality physical map should meet several criteria. first, the number of contigs representing a chromosome or a genome should be as low as possible to support contig ordering and orientation and subsequently reduce the sequencing costs. the physical contigs should also contain a minimal percentage of mis-assembled bacs  and a minimal percentage of chimerical contigs . the latter two criteria are even more important for physical mapping in complex genomes that have a high level of repeats  as such sequences tend to increase the number of bands shared randomly between two non-overlapping bacs, thereby increasing the percentage of mis-assembled bacs and chimerical contigs. in the maize physical map, the average number of shared bands between two random bacs was  <dig>  from an average  <dig> bands per bac, i.e. an average random overlap of 11%  <cit> . for the wheat 3b chromosome physical map developed with the snapshot technology, the average random overlap of bands was ~10%  <cit> .

whole genome profiling  has been developed recently as a new sequence-based physical mapping technology  <cit> . it first consists of pooling an arrayed bac library with pooling complexities and dimensions that are adapted to the genome size. then, pools of bac dna are digested, the restriction fragments are ligated with adaptors, and the adaptor-ligated fragments sequenced using the illumina genome analyzer  ii sequencer to yield restriction fragment  tags of  <dig> to  <dig> nt. deconvolution enables the assignment of these sequence tags to individual bacs. pair-wise comparisons of tags allow identifying bac overlaps and assembling contigs using the fingerprinted contigs  software  <cit> . the requirement for perfect sequence matches between tags in wgp assemblies allows for a stringent cut-off setting in fpc and thus the construction of robust physical maps. the wgp technology has been applied recently in a. thaliana using a 6x bac library, resulting in  <dig> contigs that covered  <dig> mb or 80% of the arabidopsis genome with 97% of the contig coverage validated by mapping tags to the reference sequence  <cit> .

here, we evaluated the potential of wgp for physical mapping in wheat as a proof of concept for the international wheat genome sequencing consortium  that is currently establishing a physical map of the  <dig> chromosomes of bread wheat http://www.wheatgenome.org. we used a subset of 27% of the wheat 3b chromosome bac library  <cit>  representing  <dig> mb to establish a wgp physical map and compare it with a snapshot map constructed using the same bacs. the results show that with an improved assembly methodology wgp resulted in 30% fewer contigs than snapshot and that the wgp contigs contained  <dig>  times less mis-assembled bacs. finally, we performed a series of chromosome 3b bac contig sequence assemblies using different types of roche  <dig> reads at different coverage levels to assess the potential of wgp tag integration for supporting wheat genome sequencing. the results showed that while the integration of wgp sequence tags improves low quality assemblies, it does not reduce significantly the level of sequencing coverage  necessary to achieve a high quality reference sequence because of the inherent complexity of the wheat genome and the limited number of deconvoluted tags per bac with the current approach. nevertheless, those tags are extremely useful for assigning sequence scaffolds to their bac of origin in sequencing projects where several bacs are pooled.

RESULTS
to compare the efficiency of the whole genome profiling and snapshot technologies for establishing sequence-ready physical maps in the  <dig> gb wheat genome, we performed an experiment on a subset of about one third of the 9x bac library of chromosome 3b that was used to build the chromosome 3b physical map with the snapshot technology  <cit> . in this map,  <dig>  fingerprints were assembled into  <dig> contigs  and  <dig>  singletons that cover  <dig> mb. here, we randomly picked ~27% of the singletons  and ~27% of the  <dig> contigs  to perform physical mapping. in addition, we included  <dig> bacs that originated from  <dig> mb- sized contigs  recently sequenced and fully annotated  <cit> . these were used as references to assess the accuracy of the physical map assemblies. all in all, the subset used for comparing wgp and snapshot physical mapping results contained  <dig>  bacs representing  <dig> mb with  <dig> x coverage.

whole genome profiling of  <dig> mb of wheat chromosome 3b
the selected  <dig>  wheat bacs were subjected to wgp primarily following the method described by van oeveren et al  <cit> . briefly, the bacs were pooled from  <dig> 384-well plates  of the  <dig> mb), in a 3-d fashion into row, column and splitbox pools resulting in  <dig> pools per plate . after digestion of the dna pools by ecori and msei and ligation of barcoded adaptors, amplified fragments were sequenced from the ecori restriction site ends using the illumina gaii sequencer. in total,  <dig>  million passed filter reads with  <dig> nt read length were obtained . of these reads, 95%  carried a valid  sample identification tag  and ecori restriction site sequence. it was possible to deconvolute 42% of the sequence tags . in total,  <dig>  tags were generated representing  <dig>  non-redundant tag sequences that were assigned to  <dig>  bacs . the  <dig>  bacs without any assigned tags likely result from small insert or "empty" bacs, technical problems during pooling and sequencing and/or occasional presence of overlapping bacs from the same region. a filtering step was applied to eliminate tags matching vector, e. coli, or chloroplast sequences, tags containing homopolymer sequences of five nt or longer, tags considered uninformative, i.e., present in only one bac , and tags potentially introducing ambiguities, i.e., present in more than  <dig> bacs . this reduced the number of tags to  <dig>  non-redundant tags  assigned to  <dig>  bacs.

impact of the transposable element content on tag distribution
before building the wgp physical map, we analyzed the distribution of wgp tags along the bacs and investigated whether there is a relationship between the tag distribution and the repeated elements that represent more than 80% of the wheat genome  <cit> . the number of tags and ecori sites as well as the te percentage distribution were computed using sliding windows of  <dig> kb with steps of  <dig> kb in the  <dig> bacs corresponding to the  <dig> sequenced contigs  <cit>  used as controls in this experiment. a correlation analysis was performed with a total of  <dig>  tags and  <dig>  ecori sites. a representative example is shown in figure  <dig>  the average distance between two flanking tags was  <dig>  bp with a standard deviation  of  <dig>  bp , while the median was  <dig>  bp. in one third of the cases, the distance between two tags was null because tags originated from the same ecori restriction site. no large regions without tags were observed in the  <dig> sequences and the maximum distance observed was  <dig>  bp, i.e. less than the average bac size . the correlation coefficient between the number of tags per bac and the percentage of tes was - <dig>   indicating that the abundance of transposable elements does not impact the distribution of sequence tags, i.e. wgp is a resilient technology that can be applied to genomes with high te content.

wgp physical mapping with fpc using parameters used for the construction of the arabidopsis wgp map
we first used the parameters described by van oeveren et al  <cit> , i.e. a single cut-off at 1e- <dig> and one dqing step at 1e- <dig> to perform the assembly. this resulted in  <dig> singletons and  <dig> contigs of which 36%  were estimated as chimerical and 27% as mis-assembled based on the comparison with the  <dig> reference contigs . this indicated that the default fpc parameters and/or data filtering were not stringent enough to build a robust physical map for this more complex dataset.

to increase the stringency of the analysis, we performed a second tag filtering with the parameters used previously for assembling the 3b snapshot physical map  <cit> . it consisted in the elimination of bac fingerprints comprising less than 30% of the average number of tags per bac  and those with more than  <dig>  times the average number of tags per bac . a final set of  <dig>  tags assigned to  <dig>  bacs, representing only  <dig> % of the expected single tags  and  <dig> % of the expected number of tags per bac , was obtained  and processed. using this approach, the deconvolution and filtering of the wgp data resulted in a loss of  <dig> % of the library clones; whereas, only half of them,  <dig> %, were discarded using the same criteria during the snapshot assembly  <cit> . the  <dig>  tags assigned to  <dig>  bacs were then used to build a second version of the physical map using the same fpc parameters described above. the assembly comprised  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. comparison with the  <dig> sequenced reference contigs showed that  <dig> % of the wgp contigs were chimerical  and  <dig> % of the bacs were mis-assembled. thus, although the second filtering step improved the quality of the physical map, the amount of chimerical and misassembled contigs was still too high to ensure the construction of a robust physical map, indicating that the fpc parameters used for the construction of arabidopsis wgp maps by van oeveren et al  <cit>  were not stringent enough for these wheat data.

optimizing fpc assembly parameters for the construction of a robust wgp physical map
to further improve the robustness of the assembly, we used the stepwise method defined by paux et al  <cit>  for the construction of the 3b chromosome physical map. the method consists of a series of automated fpc assemblies with decreasing stringencies starting with a high cut-off value of 1e- <dig> and ending at a cut-off of 1e- <dig>  because wgp allows for a tolerance of  <dig> and has a higher resolution, the final cut-off value can be lower than the one used with the snapshot technology . thus, here, we performed  <dig> assembly steps until a final cut-off of 1e- <dig> . the initial assembly at 1e- <dig> resulted in  <dig> contigs . subsequently, the number of contigs decreased until a cut-off of 1e- <dig> , remained stable until 1e- <dig> , and increased again at 1e- <dig> . at the last cut-off, we observed a significant increase of the number of questionable  clones before the dqing steps, part of these q clones were eliminated by fpc resulting in the split of contigs and consequently in an increased number of contigs . this showed that for wgp in wheat, reliable assemblies cannot be obtained at cut-offs lower than 1e- <dig>  no mis-assembled bac was detected between cut-offs of 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig> , while the percentage of mis-assembled bacs increased to  <dig> % at a cut-off of 1e- <dig>  up to a cut-off of 1e- <dig>  the number of chimerical contig was negligible. at cut-offs of 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig>  the number of chimerical contigs detected for  <dig> mb was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. we also examined the physical map length at the different cut-offs . to estimate the map length, we first needed to determine the average size of a cb unit . on average, one cb unit corresponds to  <dig>  kb ±  <dig>  in the wgp maps. the results show that the map length varied from  <dig> mb to  <dig> mb with the longest map obtained at a cut-off of 1e- <dig> .

all together these results show that the optimal window of cut-offs that produces the best physical map assembly, i.e. an assembly with  a minimum number of contigs,  a maximum coverage in length of the physical map,  a minimum number of chimerical contigs, and,  a minimum percentage of mis-assembled bacs, is between 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig>  to determine a single optimal value, we performed new assemblies at 1e- <dig>  1e- <dig>  1e- <dig>  1e- <dig>  1e- <dig>  and 1e- <dig> . the results indicate that the best value is 1e- <dig>  thus, we conclude that for these wheat data, a robust physical map can be obtained by wgp when using a stringent stepwise, cut-off approach starting at 1e- <dig> and ending with a final cut-off of 1e- <dig> 

comparison of snapshot and wgp automated physical map assemblies
to compare the results of the wgp and snapshot methodologies, we performed a stepwise assembly  of the snapshot fingerprints from the  <dig>  bacs clones used in wgp . the initial assembly resulted in  <dig>  contigs  and, subsequently, the number of contigs decreased steadily until a cut-off of 1e- <dig> . from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig> the number of contigs remained stable and even increased again after 1e- <dig> to eventually reach  <dig> at a cut-off of 1e- <dig> . this indicates that reliable results cannot be obtained with snapshot data in wheat at cut-offs lower than 1e- <dig> because of the presence of too many q clones. a comparison with the  <dig> sequenced contigs enabled us to estimate the number of chimerical contigs and the percentage of mis-assembled bacs at the different steps of the snapshot assembly . the percentage of mis-assembled bacs was relatively stable at cut-offs between 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig> , while it increased slowly up to  <dig> % at a cut-off of 1e- <dig>  the first chimerical contig was detected at a cut-off of 1e- <dig> and up to  <dig>  chimerical contigs for  <dig> mb were observed at a cut-off of 1e- <dig>  thus, with snapshot data, cut-offs below 1e- <dig> also lead to an increased number of chimerical contigs and therefore reduce assembly quality. the map length was estimated at each cut-off  using a cb unit value of  <dig>  kb ±  <dig>  . the results show that at 1e- <dig>  fpc builds a large number of very small contigs that results in a higher map length  than with wgp . then, the length decreases until  <dig> mb  and remains stable until 1e- <dig>  below this cut-off, the map length increases again due to an increased number of contigs . the best possible final cut-off value to obtain a physical map optimized for the four criteria described above for the wgp was 1e- <dig> 

to compare the performance and robustness of the two technologies for physical mapping in wheat, we used the results of the best physical maps obtained with each of them i.e. at a final cut-off of 1e- <dig> for the snapshot and at a final cut-off of 1e- <dig> for the wgp . the results showed a higher proportion of singletons in wgp  compared to the snapshot  . this is due to a large difference in the average number of tags per bac obtained with wgp  vs. the number of bands per bac obtained with the snapshot . as a result, the probability that there is enough information to merge two overlapping clones in a contig at an initial high stringency of 1e - <dig> is lower with the wgp technology than with the snapshot. interestingly, the higher number of singletons did not affect greatly the size of the wgp assembly and the length of the wgp map  did not significantly differ from the length of the snapshot map . this was further confirmed by the results obtained for the  <dig> reference sequenced contigs . in fact, most of the singletons obtained with the wgp physical assembly correspond to bacs that are found in the depth rather than in the length of the map. our results also indicated that wgp resulted in  <dig> % fewer contigs than snapshot for an equivalent map length and a similar number of chimerical contigs . the distribution of the contig size showed that in fact, the snapshot map contains many more small contigs  than the wgp map . finally, the comparison demonstrated that the wgp contigs contained  <dig>  times fewer mis-assembled bacs than those obtained with the snapshot. thus, we conclude that with less, but more accurate information whole genome profiling builds more robust physical maps in wheat than the snapshot technology.

evaluating the potential for wgp to support the wheat genome sequencing effort
in addition to physical mapping, wgp provides sequence information assigned to individual bacs that may facilitate wheat genome sequence assembly by merging sequence contigs or scaffolds using the relative tag order. to evaluate this possibility, we tested the effect of integration of the wgp tags with  <dig> reads generated for four of the twelve reference bac contigs from chromosome 3b  <cit> . the four contigs were resequenced in pools comprising four to nine bacs per pool, generating a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp of sequence data, including  <dig>  paired-end reads with an average length of  <dig> bp that provided 77-fold coverage of the reference contigs . random subsets of the sequences for the four pools were assembled to obtain eight different levels of coverage , using paired-end and unpaired reads as well as with or without the integration of the wgp tags. depending on the type of data used, three possible assembly outcomes were obtained: 1) assemblies performed with unpaired reads resulted in sequence contigs, 2) assemblies performed with paired-end reads without wgp tags integration as well as with unpaired reads integrated with the wgp tags resulted in scaffolds, and 3) assemblies performed with paired-end reads integrated with the wgp tags resulted in superscaffolds . the n <dig> value was estimated as the length of the shortest contig  such that the sum of contigs  of equal length or longer covers at least 90% of the length of the  <dig>  mb of the  <dig> reference contigs. the l <dig> value, i.e. the minimum number of contigs or scaffolds or superscaffolds necessary to cover 90% of the  <dig>  mb of the four reference contigs, was also estimated and then both parameters were used to assess the quality of the assemblies. in wheat, sequence assemblies can be considered of high quality when the n <dig> is >  <dig> kb which is the size of the biggest transposable elements  <cit>  and, with the smallest possible l <dig> value.

a the length of the sequences and reads are in bp.

assemblies with unpaired reads produced between  <dig> contigs at 50x coverage  and  <dig> contigs at 15x coverage . the best assembly was obtained at a coverage of 50x and it had an n <dig> value of  <dig>  bp and an l <dig> value of  <dig> . lower sequencing coverage led to decreased n <dig> and increased l <dig> values and thus a lower assembly quality. information about the positions of the wgp tags was then incorporated into the  <dig> sequence assemblies  thereby permitting some sequence contigs to be linked into scaffolds. on average, six scaffolds containing  <dig> contigs were obtained with a maximum size of  <dig> kb . in principle, the relative order of the contigs in the scaffolds can be estimated from the positions of bac-specific tags ordered along the wgp physical map. however, because the exact tag positions within a bac are not known, the positions of some sequence contigs remained ambiguous  and, in 20% of the cases, the relative order proposed by the wgp integration was different from that in the reference sequence. moreover, gaps represented 30% to  <dig> % of regions in the assembled scaffolds , likely resulting from tags with too low density in the wgp physical maps in combination with small sequence contig sizes. here, it is important to bear in mind here that we were able to measure the gap sizes by comparing scaffolds with the available reference sequence; whereas, in a de novo analysis, the estimation of the gap sizes in the scaffolds would be impossible. at 40x sequencing coverage, the integration of wgp tags allowed us to obtain a quality, in terms of n <dig> and l <dig>  equivalent to the 50x assembly without tag integration  . we conclude that the integration of wgp tags in assemblies performed with unpaired reads enables the construction of scaffolds that could not be obtained otherwise even though these scaffolds will contain ordering errors and will lack a significant proportion of sequence information. moreover, even at high sequencing coverage, the n <dig> value remained below the ~ <dig> kb requested for reliable sequence assembly in wheat . although this type of sequence assembly cannot be considered as high quality, it can provide partial information at low cost.

the assemblies of the four bac pools with  <dig> paired-end reads produced between  <dig> scaffolds at 45x coverage and  <dig> scaffolds at 15x coverage . the best assemblies were obtained between 40x and 50x coverage and resulted in an n <dig> of ~ <dig> kb and an l <dig> of  <dig> scaffolds that corresponds to the expected number of sequenced reference contigs . at sequencing coverage between 25x and 35x, the l <dig> was of  <dig> or  <dig> scaffolds and the n <dig> ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> kb which still represents very high quality assemblies. at 15x and 20x coverage, the l <dig> value was  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds respectively, and the n <dig> was  <dig> kb and  <dig>  kb respectively, which remains acceptable. the scaffolds contained between  <dig> % of gaps at 15x coverage and  <dig> % at 50x coverage . integration of the wgp tags enabled to merge, on average, seven scaffolds into two sscs . no errors in the relative order of scaffolds in the sscs were observed at 50x to 20x coverage levels; whereas, 20% of error was observed at 15x. the maximum percentage of gaps in the sscs  was 3% at this coverage. moreover, the wgp tag integration greatly improved the scaffolding at 15x and 20x by decreasing the l <dig> from  <dig> scaffolds to  <dig> sscs and from  <dig> scaffolds to  <dig> sscs, respectively, whereas the n <dig> value was increased from  <dig> to  <dig> kb and from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, respectively. thus, we conclude that with paired-end sequence information, the integration of wgp tags can improve assemblies performed with low sequencing coverage  but will result in assemblies containing more than 24% of gaps. at a coverage of 25x or higher, the integration of wgp tags does not significantly improve the quality of an assembly that is already high  .

in all, our results show that, in wheat, the integration of wgp sequence tags can help improve sequence scaffolding of pooled bacs, particularly at low sequence coverage; however, it does not reduce significantly the sequencing coverage necessary to maintain a high quality assembly in this complex genome.

discussion
wgp enables the construction of robust physical maps in wheat
with current sequencing technologies, high quality draft sequences of genomes that contain a high level of tes, such as maize  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> , can only be achieved by a clone-by-clone approach. with a size of  <dig> gb, assembling a high quality reference sequence of the bread wheat genome remains costly even with ngs technologies. it is therefore essential that the minimal tiling path used for sequencing originates from a robust and accurate physical map. because whole genome profiling is based on the assembly of identical sequence tags, it is potentially more robust than any of the previous techniques used for physical mapping in wheat . our results on a subset of about 1/ <dig> of the largest wheat chromosome  demonstrate that, combined with an adapted assembly methodology, wgp offers a promising approach to construct robust and accurate physical maps of the wheat genome. the assembly methodology developed in this study enabled the construction of a physical map of an equivalent size to the one obtained with the snapshot technology  <cit>  but with 30% fewer contigs and  <dig>  times less mis-assembled bacs. the stepwise stringent assembly methodology produced more robust and accurate results for the large and complex genome of wheat than the single step methodology that was originally employed for developing wgp on arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . this implies that the wgp method can be adapted to any species by adjusting the assembly methodology and parameters.

the quality of a physical map assembly depends on the availability of sufficient information to establish contigs as well as the capacity to minimize the number of chimerical contigs. bac library coverage and the density of bands/tags per bac used to assemble contigs are the key factors for ensuring that adequate information is available. to date, contig assembly is done with the fpc software  <cit>  that relies on the sulston score  <cit>  which corresponds to the probability of coincidence, i.e. the probability that two non-overlapping clones share by chance a given number of bands  <cit>  or sequence tags in the case of wgp. the critical parameters are the selected tolerance to consider two bands/tags as identical and the cut-off value. the latter corresponds to the threshold of the sulston score at which one considers that two clones do overlap. at a given cut-off, the higher the number of bands/tags per clone, the lower the percentage of overlap needed to merge two clones  <cit> . thus, in wgp, the tag density affects directly the capacity to generate long contigs and, therefore, increasing the tag density should enhance the capacity to merge contigs, decrease the contig numbers, and consequently increase the physical map quality. in the present work,  <dig>  tags were deconvoluted before tag and bac filtering thereby resulting in a density of  <dig> tags per bac, approximately  <dig>  times less than the value theoretically expected if all tags could be deconvoluted . by comparison, in arabidopsis thaliana the density was  <dig> tags per bac and for melon, tomato, brassica napus, and lettuce the tag densities were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . thus, the lower tag density observed in wheat than in arabidopsis  may reduce the ability to exploit fully the advantages of wgp, even though this density is comparable to those obtained in melon, brassica napus, and lettuce following digestion with ecori and msei. thus, although the generated wgp map is of high quality, we suggest three possible ways to further improve quality metrics and reduce tag loss in wgp. the first improvement is directed at limiting the loss of information at the deconvolution steps through optimized design of the pooling strategy. the defined pooling strategy is a trade-off between the costs of sample preparation and sequencing using the illumina gaii technology on the one hand and the size of the region covered by the bac library  on the other  <cit> . the percentage of the genome covered in each pooling set has an impact on the tag loss at the deconvolution step. indeed, at high coverage of the genome "in deconvolution space", there is a high probability that two or more bacs originating from the same region are present in the same pooling set. the wgp tags shared by these bacs will be lost at the deconvolution process as they are present in four or more bac pools in a 2-d pooling scheme and six or more pools in a 3-d pooling scheme. in this study, the pooling strategy consisted of pooling sets of individual plates that each covers about 23% of the target region with a 3-d pooling scheme. if we had used the whole wheat chromosome 3b bac library  with the same 3-d pooling scheme, it is likely that fewer tags would have been lost as pooling would have covered only  <dig> % of the total bac library. thus, our selection of bacs based on prior information likely decreased the "effective genome size" and thereby increased the loss of tags by deconvolution. wheat chromosome sizes range from  <dig> mb to 1gb  <cit>  while chromosome arms, currently used to construct the wheat physical maps in the framework of the iwgsc http://www.wheatgenome.org, range from  <dig> mb to  <dig> mb in size. thus, if wgp is applied with a 3-d pooling scheme to the wheat chromosome arms, the pooling sets will cover between 9% and 23% of the genome/chromosome arm size. for the larger chromosome arms, less tags are expected to be lost at the deconvolution step. another method for reducing tag loss due to a high coverage percentage of the pooling set would be to increase to  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> the number of dimensions of the pooling set. however, this would significantly increase the cost of the experiment and the amount of sequence information needed which scales linearly with the number of dimensions . thus, prior to each wgp project, the most cost efficient pooling scheme needs to be determined on the basis of the effective genome size.

another improvement is to reduce the loss of information due to a too high number of identical tags identified in a pooling set by increasing the length of sequence reads. in arabidopsis, the percentage of genome coverage for the pooling set was higher  than in this study  yet fewer tags were lost at the deconvolution step in arabidopsis than in wheat. this suggests that a higher percentage of identical tags originating from different regions were found in the same pooling sets in wheat compared to arabidospis, thereby limiting the probability of deconvoluting them, and, as a consequence, reducing the number of unique tags per bac. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that the observed average number of bacs sharing the same tags was  <dig>  instead of the expected  <dig>  . the likely explanation for this observation is that since the wheat genome is many times  larger than arabidopsis and consists of a large amount of repeated sequences, the tag length may not be optimal to avoid these confounding effects. van oeveren et al  <cit>  with a simulation on the maize genome indicated that tag lengths of  <dig> to  <dig> nt should be sufficient for wgp, even for large genomes. for wheat, we suggest that  <dig> nt is sufficient to build robust physical maps but is not optimal to fully exploit wgp. to evaluate the potential of longer reads to decrease tag loss, we calculated an index of k-mer frequencies  <cit>  on a 1x coverage sequence of the wheat genome http://www.cerealsdb.uk.net with k-mer sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> nt . this showed that  <dig> % of the 30-mers  are unique but that increasing the tag length to  <dig> nt would improve the tag uniqueness up to  <dig> %. thus, the current improvement in read length and quality of the ngs technologies will likely provide opportunities for minimizing further tag loss and therefore improve the potential of wgp in wheat in the near future.

finally, a third possibility for increasing tag density would be to choose an endonuclease that recognizes more abundant restriction sites in the wheat genome. the ecori enzyme used in this study shows a frequency of  <dig> site every  <dig>  kb in wheat . we recently observed in the same dataset that hindiii, also a  <dig> bp-cutter enzyme, shows a site frequency of  <dig> every  <dig>  kb with the difference mainly caused by the composition of te fraction . selection of alternative restriction enzymes may therefore also be used to fine tune the performance of wgp in wheat.

the second important parameter for ensuring a high quality physical map is to limit as much as possible the number of chimerical contigs. here, we estimated that, at the final cut-off value of 1e- <dig> a number of chimerical contigs is  <dig>  for  <dig> mb of sequence. van oeveren et al.  <cit>  have developed a methodology and a tool to identify chimerical contigs on the basis of the fraction of bac pairs within a contig sharing at least one tag  and the average tag density in a contig . the authors empirically determined a threshold for which the square of c <dig> divided by c <dig> provided a value that discriminated between chimerical and non-chimerical contigs. problematic bacs, then, can be identified and discarded by iteratively removing each bac of the contig and testing whether bac removal will break up the contig . we tested this approach on the wheat chromosome 3b dataset but it did not detect any of the chimerical contigs identified by comparison with the reference sequences. moreover, only two contigs were identified as chimerical in the whole dataset with this approach while  <dig> were present based on our estimation of the number of chimerical contigs in  <dig> mb. the threshold used to choose chimerical and contiguous contigs was defined from the wgp experiment on arabidopsis  <cit>  and it is likely that new parameters need to be established for wheat reinforcing the idea that parameters in the wgp analysis need to be adapted to the complexity of the target genome. with our dataset, we did not have sufficient sequence information to estimate a robust threshold value for wheat. the access to the entire 3b sequence in the near future  will help in this regard.

wgp tag integration improves low quality sequence assemblies and supports pooling strategies for achieving high quality sequence drafts
in addition to providing a robust physical map, wgp holds the potential of facilitating sequence assembly in whole genome or chromosome shotgun sequencing approaches. to date, with the current sequencing technologies, a whole genome or whole chromosome shotgun approach cannot be used to produce a high quality draft sequence of the wheat genome. here, we wanted to investigate whether wgp can be used to further empower the bac-by-bac approach adopted by the iwgsc to obtain the reference sequence of each of the  <dig> individual chromosomes from the cv. chinese spring. specifically, we wanted to see if wgp can reduce the costs of sequencing by providing a more robust physical framework and generating additional data that can support bac contig sequence assemblies. the first bac contig sequencing results obtained on chromosome 3b  <cit>  using the physical map established with the snapshot technology  <cit>  suggested that about 10% of the bacs were mis-assembled  and this was confirmed in our study . in a bac-by-bac approach, the mis-assembled bacs identified at the sequence assembly step need to be replaced by other bacs thereby increasing sequencing cost. by providing a physical map with less than 3% of mis-assembled bacs , wgp thus would decrease the cost of sequencing by ~7% compared to a physical map constructed with the snapshot approach.

the assembly simulations indicated that with a low coverage/low cost sequencing approach  sequence assemblies can be improved significantly by integrating sequence tags produced by wgp. these assemblies contain, however, a significant amount of ambiguities in the contig order and a lack of knowledge about the percentage and distribution of gaps . while such sequence cannot be considered a reference sequence, it can be used to develop molecular markers and perform preliminary comparative analysis. assemblies with paired-end reads produce scaffolds for which the percentage and distribution of gaps can be estimated. at high sequence coverage , such paired-end reads produce reliable assemblies whose quality cannot be significantly improved by integrating with wgp tags at the density produced in this study. in contrast, at low sequencing coverage , wgp tag integration improves the assemblies by facilitating the construction of long, superscaffolds. however, such superscaffolds can include up to 15% of mis-ordered scaffolds that contain gaps of up to 30%. this type of sequence is comparable to the quality of sequence obtained at high coverage levels with unpaired reads. thus, the complexity of the wheat genome with the presence of large and numerous transposable elements with highly similar sequences makes it impossible to produce a high quality reference sequence  without any paired-end information and a minimum coverage of 25x. thus, currently, wgp sequence tags produced during physical mapping are helpful to link sequence scaffolds but they cannot be used to decrease the sequencing coverage necessary to obtain a high quality assembly in such a complex genome.

in our opinion, the greatest potential for wgp is the possibility of increasing the degree of pooling in sequencing projects based on bac pools, a strategy that has been proposed to reduce sequencing costs in large genomes  <cit>  and is currently being utilized for sequencing chromosome 3b of bread wheat. in this case, the assembly of sequence reads from bac pools of two or more unrelated physical contigs leads to sequence contigs  or scaffolds  that need to be reassigned to their respective physical contig of origin. wgp can provide the information needed for this assignment. in the 3b project, 52% of the  <dig> pools of the minimal tiling path used for  <dig> gs flx titanium sequencing contain two or more physical contigs . the  <dig>  wgp tags generated in this pilot study will be helpful for assigning and ordering the sequence contigs or scaffolds produced from these pools.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we evaluated the potential of wgp for physical mapping and sequencing of complex genomes like wheat. the comparison of wheat wgp and snapshot physical maps showed that, with an adapted assembly methodology, wgp needed 30% less contigs to cover the same regions than the snapshot physical map and that wgp contigs contained  <dig>  times less mis-assembled bacs. thus, we conclude that, with a suitable assembly methodology, wgp builds more robust physical maps than the snapshot technology in wheat and that wgp can be adapted to any genome. moreover, we evaluated the benefit of integrating wgp tags in different sequence assemblies obtained after next generation sequencing of bac pools. the results showed that wgp tag integration improves low quality sequence assembly. however, to achieve a high quality draft sequence assembly, a sequencing depth of 25x roche/ <dig> paired-end reads is required, at which point wgp tag integration does not provide additional scaffolding value. nonetheless, wgp tags will support the efficient sequencing of bac pools by enabling reliable assignment of sequence scaffolds to their bac of origin.
