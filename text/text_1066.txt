BACKGROUND
at the initial stages of drug discovery and design, there are often millions of candidate drug molecules under consideration. therefore, the early prediction of activity for drug candidates using computational methods is very important to save time and resources. due to importance of early prediction of activity of drug candidates on the target protein, a large number of computational methods were developed. qsar  analysis is one of the most widely used methods to relate structure to function. qsar analysis can be described as the quantitative effort of understanding the correlation between the chemical structure of a molecule and its biological and chemical activities such as biotransformation ability, reaction ability, solubility or target activity <cit> . qsar assumes that structurally similar molecules should have similar activities, which draws attention to the importance of detecting the most significant chemical and structural descriptors of the drug candidates. the drug activity behavior can be predicted using a wide range of descriptors.

some of the most widely used 3d qsar methods can be listed as follows: comparative molecular field analysis , comparative molecular similarity indices analysis , eigenvalue analysis . in comfa, molecular descriptors are calculated and selected by calculating the electrostatic and steric potential energies between a positively charged carbon atom located at each vertex of a rectangular grid and a series of molecules embedded within the grid <cit> . the sensitivity to small changes in the alignment of compounds is reduced and hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic fields are introduced to in comsia <cit> . in these methods aligning of the structures is essential, therefore eva was used due to the fact that methods that are sensitive to 3d structure but do not require superposition were introduced <cit> . the generation of descriptors in eva is based on molecular vibrations, where a normal mode calculation is required to simulate the ir spectrum of a molecule  <cit> .

in this study e-dragon  <cit> , which is a remote version of the dragon descriptor calculation program, was used to calculate the molecular descriptors for drugs. it applies the calculation of molecular descriptors developed by todeschini et. al <cit>  and provides more than  <dig>  molecular descriptors, which are divided into  <dig> blocks, including atom types, functional group and fragment counts, topological and geometrical descriptors, autocorrelation and information indices, 3d molecular descriptors, molecular properties  <cit> . dragon incorporates two steps; the first step eliminates low-variable descriptors, the second step optimizes the descriptor subset using a q2-guided descriptor selection by means of a genetic algorithm using several data analysis methods: unsupervised forward selection  <cit> , associative neural network  <cit> , polynomial neural network  <cit>  and partial least squares   <cit> .

in most studies, partial least squares  <cit>  is used to develop qsar models by reducing the number of attributes in the descriptor set to a small number of attributes correlated with the defined property being modeled.

in our approach, to classify activities of drug compounds, we used the mixed-integer programming  based hyper-boxes method that takes the molecular descriptors as attributes of the model. the problem of qsar analysis and the classification of drug candidates are addressed based on their published ic <dig> values by introducing an algorithm that combines pls regression with mixed-integer linear programming based hyper-boxes classification method. the strength of the algorithm not only comes from combining regression with classification but also the ability to improve the classification accuracies by its iterative approach. the algorithm that links qsar descriptor model generation with inhibitory activity classification was applied to inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase , benzodiazepine receptor , dihydrofolate reductase  and cyclooxygenase- <dig>  and finally for cytochrome p <dig> c <dig> .

the comparison of our classification accuracies with the accuracies of the classification methods available in the weka data mining package  <cit>  is also made. weka contains  <dig> different classification methods, but here only  <dig> of those, which had the best classification accuracies for the data sets considered in this paper are discussed. brief overview of these classifiers is further presented in the methods section. our approach outperformed all of the classifiers available in weka for each model of the all of the  <dig> data sets, even reaching 100% accuracy in predicting the activity classification of the inhibitor sets, ache inhibitors and cytochrome p <dig> c <dig>  a total number of  <dig> qsar models were built in this study for  <dig> inhibitor sets, and in  <dig> of them the accuracy of our methodology exceeded the accuracy of the second best classifier with more than 10%. through all of the  <dig> models, the smallest difference in the accuracies is  <dig> % and the largest difference is  <dig> %.

RESULTS
to determine the threshold values, which divide the low and high classes, for all datasets the ic <dig> values were statistically analyzed. in this study, we consider  <dig> datasets, of which ic <dig> values and structures were reported  <cit> . in addition to these datasets we introduced a new dataset for cytochrome p <dig> c <dig> inhibitors that we collected from the literature. cytochrome p <dig> c <dig> is a well-recognized target for prostate cancer treatment, since selective inhibition of the enzyme exerts control over androgen synthesis  <cit> .

after building the descriptor models by e-dragon  <cit> , three models were constructed during the pls analysis as:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> descriptor models. the reason that we build  <dig> models with different number of variables is due to the fact that we might come up with insignificant descriptors within one of these models, so that we can replace them by a more significant one from the other models.

the qsar models with the most significant descriptors, as they were concluded as a result of the initial pls study for the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> attribute models are listed in table  <dig> with their r <dig> values. table  <dig> shows the optimal r <dig> values of our pls models given by minitab <cit>  with predefined number of descriptors from the descriptors calculated by e-dragon software, and the r <dig> values of the pls models calculated by sutherland et al <cit>  with the same data sets but different methods and models.

* pls results reported by sutherland et al.  <cit> .

the r <dig> values shows that, the models we developed with  <dig> and <dig> descriptors for ache bzr and cox- <dig> are stronger than or at least as strong as the other models reported by sutherland et al <cit>  in representing the ic <dig> values in terms of selected descriptors, but our model for dhfr_rl is not as good as the other reported models. high r <dig> values of cytochrome p <dig> c <dig> models also suggest good prediction of the ic <dig> values and a promising initial model for classification.

it is worth noting that, our study is not simply a regression study, but we develop these regression models in order to use the selected descriptors from this step as attributes for accurate classification.

iterations
at the end of the initial runs of the hyper-boxes classification method, classification results are obtained. the next step is the significance analysis and the improvement of the classification accuracies by iterations. the weakest and the strongest descriptors were calculated by significance analysis and, the weakest descriptor in the current model was replaced by the most significant one from other models at each iteration. the classification runs are repeated after each replacement, by milp based hyper-boxes method. when the classification accuracy is not improved at the end of iteration, the algorithm stops and final results are reported .

while choosing the weakest descriptor to leave the model, the descriptor with the maximum p-value  for one of the high or low classes was selected. the weakest descriptor was replaced by the strongest one. the strongest descriptor defined as the attribute whose maximum p-value for high and low classes is the minimum among the other descriptors.

final classification
as shown in table  <dig>  we compared the classification accuracies of our model with the results that calculated using all of the classification methods in weka. we report only the results of the <dig> best performing weka classifiers. our method performed better than all of the other classifiers for every model of each dataset. our integrated approach of regression and classification for ache and cytochrome p <dig> c <dig> inhibitors datasets displayed an activity prediction accuracy of 100%. the activity of bzr inhibitors was calculated with the accuracy of  <dig> %. we were able to predict the activities of cox- <dig> inhibitors with  <dig> % in a 7-descriptor model. in addition, the prediction accuracy of activity of dhfr_rl, dhfr_pc, and dhfr_tg inhibitors were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. the best performing weka classifiers are also highlighted in table  <dig> 

to verify the reliability of the accuracies given by 10-fold cross validation standard deviations of the classification accuracies were also calculated for each run of milp based hyper-boxes method. the sensitivity of classification accuracy to the number of descriptors is also examined and the results are reported in table  <dig>  small number of descriptors may lead to poor models while a large number of descriptors may lead to inefficient models that incorporate non-informative descriptors for classification. in all of the datasets considered in this paper, this trend is observed from the accuracy values and standard deviation of accuracies for 10-fold cross validation.

detailed analysis: cytochrome p <dig> c <dig> inhibitors
we applied our approach to classify activities of drug molecules in a new data set  that is constructed from data in literature  <cit> . the molecular structures and ic <dig> values for these molecules are given in additional file  <dig>  this approach may be utilized for the new molecules that inhibit activity of cytochrome p <dig> c  <dig> before channeling them into experiments.

for the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> attribute models the selected most significant descriptors as a result of the initial pls study are listed with r <dig> values  of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

when the hyper-boxes model was implemented,  <dig> and the 15-attribute models reached 100% accuracy, by 10-fold cross validation. the 7-attribute model, however, still needed to be improved since the classification results reached an average accuracy of  <dig> %. this led us to conclude that there may be some overestimated descriptors actually having low significance in terms of classifying the drug activity. therefore, significance tests were performed after the preliminary classification runs.

the results of the final run of hyper-boxes classification for the 7-descriptor model shows that the effect of changing the less significant descriptors with the more significant ones improved the accuracy of the classification from  <dig> % to 100%. since we have reached 100% accuracy in 7-descriptors models, the significant ones may be included in this model among 912-descriptors that are initially calculated by e-dragon. brief explanations of the descriptors can be found in table  <dig> 
 <cit> .

discussion
early analysis and estimation of the drug activities by computational methods are widely studied in order to narrow down drug candidates for further experimental tests. the accuracy comparison of our algorithm with other qsar algorithms suggests that drug activities can be classified with a significantly higher accuracy with the method introduced in this study.

after model building by e-dragon qsar software, the pls runs were performed to determine the best model in representing the depended variables  in terms of the independent variables . the corresponding r <dig> values were calculated to determine the reliability of the pls models, where a model with a higher r <dig> value can be regarded as a more reliable model to proceed to the classification step. the r <dig> values for the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> descriptor models of p <dig> c <dig> were obtained by pls runs and, with a considerable strength in representing the ic <dig> values we accepted the initial models. while the high r <dig> values of the ache inhibitor models also were promising on its own to build the classification model, the initial models of bzr and cox- <dig> inhibitor sets were chosen after the comparison of pls results with the results reported in the literature as presented in table  <dig>  for dhfr inhibitors data sets such comparison was not also possible, therefore the models with the best r2values in pls studies were chosen among all other possible models calculated. r <dig> value directly depends on the values of attributes  and the number of attributes in the corresponding model.

we first applied our iterative algorithm to the large and widely used qsar data sets in order to validate our methodology. the strength of our algorithm was presented by comparing our classification accuracies with the classification accuracies of  <dig> weka classifiers, on  <dig> inhibitor sets. the attribute sets prepared as the input for weka classifiers were the same as the ones, by which we built the last iteration of our milp based hyper-boxes classification model. in other words, those were the most significant attributes that we used to develop the final classification models and reached our best accuracies. our approach outperformed all of the classifiers available in weka for each model of the all of the  <dig> data sets, even reaching 100% accuracy in predicting the activity classification of the inhibitor sets, ache inhibitors and cytochrome p <dig> c <dig>  a total number of  <dig> qsar models were built in this study for  <dig> inhibitor sets, and in  <dig> of them the accuracy of our methodology exceeded the accuracy of the second best classifier with more than 10%. through all of the  <dig> models, the smallest difference in the accuracies is  <dig> % and the largest difference is  <dig> %.

the higher prediction accuracy of the model not only comes from the choice of initial models by pls analysis but also the characteristics of milp based hyper-boxes method. the milp based hyper-boxes approach allows using more than one hyper-box in order to define a single class  <cit> . moreover, this approach deals with problematic and non-problematic instances separately and prevents overlapping of final hyper-boxes  <cit> . therefore, these strengths significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the milp based hyper-boxes approach compared to other data classification methods. data on true positive and false positive rates for accuracy comparison of classifiers for all data sets are given in additional file  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
drug molecules can be classified as low active or high active based on ic <dig> values. in this study an integrated approach was introduced, which combines the milp based hyper-boxes method with partial least squares regression to effectively classify the drug candidates. as a result, the most significant molecular descriptors of the drug molecules were also reported. weka is used to compare the classification accuracies of the developed model with the classifiers in the weka data mining package. the best classification algorithm in weka database gave an accuracy of maximum 85% in classifying the activity of drug molecules, through the datasets used in this study.

our method was applied in order to predict the activities of widely known inhibitor datasets for acetylcholinesterase , benzodiazepine receptor , dihydrofolate reductase , cyclooxygenase- <dig>  with known ic <dig> values. the results suggests that the approach used in this paper results in better classification accuracies compared to other classification methods reported in literature. this approach also applied to cytochrome p <dig> c <dig> inhibitors and their activities were predicted with 100% accuracy.
