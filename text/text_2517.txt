BACKGROUND
over the past two decades, conception rates for artificial insemination  breeding programs in japanese black cattle have been gradually declining   <cit> . this trend has also been observed in dairy cattle  <cit> . in contrast, the fertilization rates for a single natural service in cattle have been reported to range from  <dig> to 90% in various breeds, reviewed in  <cit> . the difference between “conception rate” and “fertilization rate” is approximately 35%, suggesting that embryonic mortality occurs mainly after postzygotic development, reviewed in  <cit>  . therefore, researchers have aimed to identify the genetic factors involved in embryonic mortality during postzygotic development to improve reproductive performance and profitability in cattle.fig.  <dig> the association of cnvrs with embryonic mortality in  <dig> japanese black cattle. a schematic representation of artificial insemination  breeding program in japanese black cattle. at each parity, female cattle were artificially inseminated  at the onset of estrus. second ai  was carried out after the cow showed estrus. the resumption of estrus after the 1st ai indicated that the fertilization or embryo development derived from the 1st ai had failed. thus, embryonic mortality was defined by cows that received a 2nd ai at 18– <dig> days , 30– <dig> d, 61– <dig> d, 91– <dig> d, and  <dig> d–parturition after the 1st ai. b manhattan plot of the association of  <dig> deleted-type cnvrs with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> d in  <dig> japanese black cattle. chromosomes are distinguished with alternating colors . dashed line is the bonferroni-corrected threshold for genome-wide significance  =  <dig> ). c manhattan plot of the association of the surrounding snps, which are derived from illumina bovinehd beadchip array, at approximately ± 400 kb distance from cnvr_ <dig>  positions are based on the umd <dig>  assembly of the bovine genome




copy number variation  is defined as deleted or duplicated segments of genome that range from 1 kb to several mb, reviewed in  <cit> . cnvs cause diseases via various mechanisms such as gene dosage modification and gene structure disturbance, either directly by exposing recessive alleles or by disturbing the regulatory regions of genes, reviewed in  <cit> . recently, two studies of holstein and nordic red cattle found that deleted-type cnvs were associated with infertility  <cit> . more specifically, the associated regions harboring the causative cnvs were identified using snp array, as these cnvs were in linkage disequilibrium  with their neighboring snps. however, genome-wide cnv screening for embryonic mortality has not been directly applied to cattle populations. recently, we reported genome-wide cnv maps for  <dig> japanese black cattle, identified using the illumina bovine high-density  beadchip array   <cit> . these high-resolution cnv maps enabled us to directly scan the cnvs associated with embryonic mortality in japanese black cattle.

in this study, we evaluated embryonic mortality as a categorical trait with a threshold model  <cit>  and conducted a genome-wide cnv association study using the traits. we identified a deleted-type cnv, encompassing annexin a <dig> , which was associated with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> days after ai.

RESULTS
embryonic mortality was evaluated as a categorical trait with a threshold model in japanese black cattle
embryonic mortality was defined in cows that received a second round of ai  at 18– <dig> days , 30– <dig> d, 61– <dig> d, 91– <dig> d, and  <dig> d–parturition after the first ai  . the 2nd ai was performed when estrus resumed after the 1st ai in our ai breeding program. the resuming of estrus after the 1st ai indicated that fertilization or conception derived from the 1st ai had failed. embryonic mortality was estimated from  <dig>  mating records, derived from  <dig>  reproductive females. the embryonic mortality rate in each period is shown in table  <dig>  as cattle are a mono-ovulatory species and usually delivers a single calf at each parity, the embryonic mortality in cattle was naturally expressed as a binary categorical trait. thus, we estimated genetic parameters in a threshold model using bayesian analysis with gibbs sampling. the threshold model assumes an unobservable underlying continuous variable , with a threshold deciding the observable binary outcome . table  <dig> shows the estimates of variance components and genetic parameters for embryonic mortality for each period. the estimates of direct heritability of embryonic mortality at each stage were estimated to be  <dig> – <dig> , consistent with previous reports of female fertility and conception-related traits in cattle, reviewed in  <cit> .table  <dig> number of records and embryonic mortality rate  at each period

embryonic mortality was defined by cows that received a second round of ai at 18– <dig> days , 30– <dig> d, 61– <dig> d, 91– <dig> d, and  <dig> d–parturition after the 1st ai

cnvr_ <dig> was associated with embryonic mortality on chromosome  <dig> in japanese black cattle
we previously identified  <dig> cnv regions , defined as the union region of overlapping cnvs detected in at least two animals  <cit> , in the autosomes of  <dig> japanese black cattle  <cit> . of the  <dig> animals,  <dig> cows were evaluated for genetic parameters of embryonic mortality as described above. several studies have demonstrated that deleted chromosome segments, deleted-type cnvs, are directly connected to diseases in cattle ; thus, we evaluated the association between deleted-type cnvrs and embryonic mortality in this study. of  <dig> cnvrs, we selected  <dig> of the deleted-type cnvrs that were present at a frequency of > 1% in  <dig> animals  <cit>  . we conducted a genome-wide cnv association study with the breeding value of embryonic mortality in each period using gemma software  <cit> . the genomic inflation factor  in this analysis was  <dig> , indicating that the samples were appropriate for an association study. we found that one cnvr, cnvr_ <dig>  was associated with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> d after ai, reaching the bonferroni-corrected threshold ; however, it was not associated with embryonic mortality in other periods or overall conception rate . the cnvr_ <dig> was located within a  <dig>  bp window from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp on bovine chromosome  <dig>  . of note, the surrounding snps at approximately ± 400 kb distance from cnvr_ <dig> were not associated with the traits studied  and were not in linkage disequilibrium with cnvr_ <dig> , indicating that this cnvr could not be detected in a genome-wide association study using single-marker in snp array.table  <dig> cnvr_ <dig> with genome-wide significant associations with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> d

the mean log r ratio of  <dig> snps, which were consecutively located within a  <dig>  bp window between  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp on chromosome  <dig>  was low . we found that cnvr_ <dig> overlapped with exons  <dig> to  <dig> of anxa <dig> . quantitative pcr  showed that the copy number was approximately one , which was in agreement with the expected deleted-type cnvr.fig.  <dig> cnvr_ <dig> overlapping with anxa <dig> gene region on chromosome  <dig>  a regional snps plot of cnvr_ <dig>  the mean log r ratio is indicated on the y-axis. the mean log r ratio of cnvr_ <dig> animals  and the mean log r ratio of non-cnvr_ <dig> animals  were calculated from  <dig> animals. snp positions were based on the umd <dig>  assembly of the bovine genome. b cnvr_ <dig>  was visualized using the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . the ensembl ids and refseq gene symbol of anxa <dig> were labeled. c qpcr validation of cnvr_ <dig>  the left-most bar represents a calibrator animal . the calibrator animal is assumed to contain two copies of the dna segment detected from the penncnv analysis. basic transcription factor  <dig> gene , which served as an internal qpcr standard for both copies at a locus , was co-amplified with the primers. the x-axis represents the animals. brackets represent the cnvr_322-detected animals using the illumina bovinehd beadchip array. error bars represent the ± standard error of the mean obtained from three experiments




cnvr_ <dig> was generated from non-allelic homologous recombination by 63 bp homology arms
cnvr_ <dig> was located between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp . thus, the breakpoints were assumed to be present between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp on the centromeric side, and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp on the telomeric side . we designed a forward primer series for  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, and a reverse primer series for  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp , resulting in a ~800-bp pcr products using cf_ <dig> primer and tr_ <dig> primer from the genomic dna of cnvr_322-detected animals, but not in control animals. sequencing showed the breakpoints, confirming  <dig>  bp between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp . analysis of sequence traces from cnvr_322-detected animals identified that there were 63 bp reads bridging the breakpoint , were present on both sides of the  <dig>  bp flanking regions in wild-type animals , indicating that cnvr_ <dig> was generated by non-allelic homologous recombination   via the 63-bp homologous sequences . nahr-mediated cnvs were commonly found in the genomes .fig.  <dig> identification of breakpoints of cnvr_ <dig>  a genomic structure of cnvr_ <dig> regions . cnvr_ <dig> is flanked by 63 bp same-directed sequences  . analysis of sequence traces from cnvr_322-detected animals identified that 63 bp reads bridging the breakpoint were present on both side of  <dig> -bp flanking regions . model for generation of cnvr_ <dig> by non-allelic homologous recombination  . after nahr, the resulting region contained a 63-bp sequence . the positions were based on the umd <dig>  assembly of the bovine genome. b sequence of the 63-bp flanking cnvr_ <dig>  c genotyping test for cnvr_ <dig> by pcr. schematic representation of the primer position on cnvr_ <dig>  pcr amplification within and across cnvr_ <dig> for two homozygous wild type  and two carrier  animals. pcr primers f_ <dig> and r_ <dig> are for the wild-type allele , and pcr primers f_ <dig> and r_ <dig> are for the cnvr_ <dig> allele . m, 100 bp ladder markers




to test the genotype of cnvr_ <dig> by pcr, we designed multiplex primers for the cnvr_ <dig> allele  and wild type allele  . a 580-bp band was detected in cnvr_322-detected animals using primers f_ <dig> and r_ <dig> , whereas the band was not detected in non-cnvr_322-detected animals . therefore, the pcr-based dna test was used to detect the cnvr_ <dig> allele.

cnvr_ <dig> creates a anxa <dig> null allele
the deletion of 34 kb, which contained exons  <dig> to  <dig>  resulted in the juxtaposition of exons  <dig> and  <dig> in the anxa <dig> transcript . to examine the effect of the 34 kb deletion on the transcripts, we designed primers for exons  <dig> to  <dig> and for exons  <dig> to  <dig>  and performed rt-pcr using total rna of the abomasum of cattle, as anxa <dig> was expressed in the abomasum . we amplified a 197-bp fragment, which is consistent with the predicted size from exon  <dig> to  <dig> deleted-type anxa <dig> cdna in cnvr_ <dig>  from the carrier but not from wild-type animals . unexpectedly, we also found a fragment of approximately 300 bp in the carrier animals . sequencing of the 197-bp rt-pcr product confirmed the juxtaposition of exons  <dig> and  <dig> in the deleted-type anxa <dig> transcripts , indicating that the exon  <dig> to  <dig> deleted-transcript of anxa <dig> was present in carrier animals . sequencing of the 300-bp rt-pcr product resulted in the discovery of a 90 bp fragment , which corresponds to the entire intron  between the 7th and 8th exon of anxa <dig>  inserted into the deleted-transcript of anxa <dig> at the 75 bp position . the new transcript did not splice the intron between the 7th and 8th exon of anxa <dig> in the cnvr_ <dig> carrier animals, whereas the transcript was not present in wild-type animals . we hypothesize that these transcripts were in-frame of translation and the predicted molecular masses of the deleted-type  and the deleted-/inserted-type proteins  were  <dig> aa  and  <dig> aa , respectively .fig.  <dig> the cnvr_ <dig> creates a anxa <dig> null allele. a schematic representation of exons  <dig> to  <dig> of anxa <dig>  and the cnvr_ <dig> region . primers for exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are represented by arrows. b pcr amplification of cdna from the abomasum within and across the cnvr_ <dig> region for four wild-type  and two carrier  animals. pcr primers for exons  <dig> and  <dig> amplified an allele  in all animals , and pcr primers for exons  <dig> and  <dig> amplified a wild-type allele  and two mutant alleles  . m, 100 bp ladder markers. c the predicted amino acid  length and molecular mass of wild-type , exon  <dig> to  <dig> deleted-type , and exon  <dig> to  <dig> deleted-/inserted-type  is  <dig> aa ,  <dig> aa , and  <dig> aa . in the exon  <dig> to  <dig> deleted-/inserted-type protein,  <dig> aa  was inserted in the  <dig> aa position . d western blotting for wild-type  and two carrier  animals using antibodies to full length  and to the c terminal region  of the anxa <dig> protein. recombinant bovine anxa <dig> proteins were expressed in hela cells by pcaggs-anxa <dig> expression plasmid and used as a positive control.　a specific band was detected for anxa <dig> at approximately 30 kda . brackets represent migration areas below 30 kda. e quantitation of anxa <dig> bands  were relative to a wild-type animal . relative anxa <dig> band intensities were measured using the imagequant tl analysis toolbox. the amounts of loaded proteins were calibrated using coomassie brilliant blue-stained bands  between  <dig> and 50 kda. the dashed line represents average intensities from wild-type  and cnvr_ <dig> animals 




to determine whether these deleted-type anxa <dig> proteins were present in the cnvr_ <dig> carrier animals, we performed western blotting with anti-anxa <dig> antibodies to the full-length and to the c-terminal of the anxa <dig> protein, a region shared among the wild-type and the deleted-type anxa <dig> proteins. the antibodies detected a 30-kda band in lysates from the abomasum and cells expressing recombinant anxa <dig> protein . the intensities of the 30-kda bands were lower in the carrier animals than in the wild-type animals . no specific immunoreactive bands were detected in the carrier animals below 30 kda using the antibody against the c-terminal of the anxa <dig> protein , suggesting that the deleted-type anxa <dig> protein could be untranslated or unstable; thus, cnvr_ <dig> generates null alleles of anxa <dig> 

the association of cnvr_ <dig> was replicated in another dataset and the frequency of cnvr_ <dig> in the japanese black cattle population was surveyed
we genotyped  <dig> cows that were randomly selected from  <dig>  reproductive females. the heterozygote occurred in  <dig> of  <dig> animals, but the homozygous for the risk-allele was not observed in the population. results showed that the cnvr_ <dig> heterozygotes  were significantly associated with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> d after ai, compared to non-cnvr_ <dig>  animals .fig.  <dig> effect of cnvr_ <dig> on embryonic mortality at 30- <dig> d in  <dig> japanese black cattle. the breeding value of embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> d after ai in  <dig> non-cnvr_ <dig>  animals and  <dig> cnvr_ <dig> heterozygote  animals. the cnvr_ <dig> heterozygote  was significantly associated with embryonic mortality at 30– <dig> d after ai, compared to non-cnvr_ <dig>  




to determine the allele frequency in the population, we further genotyped a sample of  <dig> animals: cows represented  <dig> animals, which were not evaluated for embryonic mortality, and steers were  <dig>  the heterozygote occurred in  <dig> cows and  <dig> steers, whereas the homozygous for the risk-allele was absent from the population . the frequency of the risk-allele was  <dig>  in cows and  <dig>  in steers , indicating that the allele was not common in the population.

cnvr_ <dig> has no effects on meat traits of japanese black cattle population
previous studies have reported that some disease-associated alleles are accompanied by a favorable effect on other economic traits in cattle . meat from japanese black cattle is highly valued for its abundant marbling due to considerable intramuscular fat deposition  <cit> . therefore, the elimination of the cnvr_ <dig> allele was validated to ensure that it exerted adverse effects on meat quality and yield traits in this breed. we did not find a significant association between cnvr_ <dig> and any meat traits in  <dig> animals . thus, the cnvr_ <dig> allele can be eliminated from japanese black cattle without adverse effects on economically important meat traits.

loss of maternal anxa <dig> in mice increases embryonic mortality and the mouse model recapitulates several features of the cnvr_ <dig> heterozygous cattle
annexins, a highly conserved gene family, have four ca2+ binding sites and are ca2+-dependent, reverse binding to negatively charged phospholipid-binding proteins in membranes, reviewed in  <cit> . annexins are involved in a large number of cellular processes that are associated with membrane scaffolding, vesicle trafficking, and ca2+-mediated events. they also play critical roles in the inhibition of coagulation and inflammation, reviewed in  <cit> . anxa <dig>  is a member of the annexin gene family; however, it has only one ca2+ binding site  <cit>  and displays a low capacity for phospholipids that are dependent on ca2+  <cit> . the functions of anxa <dig> in vivo, including those relevant to embryonic mortality, have not yet been evaluated.

to examine whether anxa <dig> is involved in embryonic mortality, we generated an anxa <dig> null mice line using the crispr/cas <dig> system  <cit> . we produced pups that carried an 8-bp deletion  in exon  <dig> of anxa <dig>  that was predicted to cause a frame-shift and generate terminal codons at multiple positions . we confirmed that anxa <dig> was not present in anxa <dig> homozygous mice  using western blot and immunohistochemistry , indicating that anxa <dig> was a null allele.

mice heterozygous for the anxa <dig>  were outwardly normal, fertile, and born in appropriate mendelian ratios. analysis of the f <dig> from the mating of anxa10
+/- mice showed that the genotype ratios of +/+ to +/- to -/- animals were 37:76: <dig>  indicating that embryos with anxa10
-/- did not exhibit embryonic mortality . crossbreeding experiments showed that litter sizes in crosses from both anxa10
-/- and anxa10
+/- females had a reduced number of pups relative to that of anxa10
+/+ females . in contrast, the litter sizes of anxa10
-/- and anxa10
+/- females were not statistically different , indicating that the effect of the maternal anxa <dig> allele on embryonic mortality was dominant. in cattle, although animals that were homozygous for the cnvr_ <dig> were not observed in the population  to be directly compared with the heterozygotes, embryonic mortality was associated more with the heterozygotes than with the wild-typed animals . one possibility is that the effect of the maternal cnvr_ <dig> allele on embryonic mortality may be dominant in cattle.fig.  <dig> loss of maternal anxa <dig> in mice causes embryonic mortality. a litter sizes in crossbreeding experiments of anxa10

in relation to this, the litter sizes in crosses from both anxa10
-/- and anxa10
+/- females were reduced by approximately 30% compared with those of anxa10
+/+females , which indicates partial lethality. the surviving embryos had healthy placentas  and approximately 70% pups were born normally, indicating that anxa <dig> is a quantitative trait locus for embryonic mortality in mice.

to define the stage at which embryos died, the numbers of corpora lutea , implantation sites, and embryos were counted. the average number of cl at embryonic day   <dig>  was not different between anxa10
-/- female × anxa10
+/+ male crosses and anxa10
+/+ female × anxa10
+/+ male crosses . consistent with this finding, the histological examination of ovaries showed that anxa10
-/- female mice had normal oocytes and cl , indicating that anxa10
-/-female mice showed normal follicular development and ovulation. in addition, the average number of implantation sites at e <dig>  was not different between anxa10
-/- female × anxa10
+/+ male crosses and anxa10
+/+female × anxa10
+/+ male crosses . in contrast, the numbers of cl and embryos at e <dig>  were significantly different between anxa10
-/- female × anxa10
+/+ male crosses and anxa10
+/+ female × anxa10
+/+ male crosses . consistent with these results, we also found embryo resorption at e <dig>  and e <dig>  , indicating that the embryos of anxa10
-/-females died between implantation stages e <dig>  and e <dig> . this stage was consistent with the stage of cattle embryo mortality at 30– <dig> days after ai, as cattle embryos are implanted in the uterus between  <dig> and 21 days after fertilization . these findings suggest that the embryonic mortality in anxa10
-/- female mice and in cnvr_ <dig> heterozygote cows occurs between the implantation and the post-implantation stages and the function of maternal anxa <dig> in embryo development may be shared between cattle and mice, thus, the anxa10
-/- mouse is a useful model for the study of embryo mortality in cattle.

annexin a <dig> , a member of the annexin gene family, is a critical factor for suppressing inappropriate blood coagulation in maternal blood vessels, reviewed in  <cit> . ueki et al.  <cit>  recently reported that anxa <dig> is localized in the blood vessel walls of the mouse placenta and the loss of anxa <dig> in mother mice results in the accumulation of platelet thrombosis and anemia in maternal placental blood vessels, leading to embryo death and reduced litter size in a manner similar to that of anxa10
-/- female mice. in contrast, we did not find platelet thrombi in the placentas of anxa10
-/- females, which was confirmed using antibody to an anti-integrin beta  <dig>  . in addition, the placenta did not exhibit anemia, as both fetal erythrocytes with nuclei and maternal erythrocytes were present in the labyrinth zone of the placenta in anxa10
-/- females . this suggests that the mechanism underlying embryonic mortality may be different from that of the anxa5
-/- female mice.


anxa <dig> was abundantly expressed in the abomasum of cattle  as well as in the stomach of mice . the decrease in anxa <dig> expression was correlated with de-differentiation and tumor progression in gastric carcinoma  <cit> , pointing to a possible tumor suppressor role. however, the expression pattern and the de-differentiation role may not be directly connected to embryonic mortality in cnvr_ <dig> heterozygous cows and anxa10
-/- female mice. since it is presently not known how the loss of maternal anxa <dig> in cattle causes embryonic mortality in the early stages of pregnancy, further investigation into the functions of maternal anxa <dig> using anxa10
-/- mice will provide novel information regarding the underlying mechanisms of embryonic mortality in cnvr_ <dig> heterozygous cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we evaluated embryonic mortality as a categorical trait with a threshold model and directly scanned the cnvs associated with embryonic mortality in japanese black cattle. we identified a deleted-type cnvr, which encompassed anxa <dig>  that was associated with embryonic mortality after the post-implantation stage in cattle. consistent with this, we demonstrated that the crosses of both anxa10
-/- and anxa10
+/- female mice showed a reduced number of pups relative to that of wild-type females, and also that some embryos in anxa10
-/- females died between the implantation and the post-implantation stages. these results suggest that anxa <dig> is a maternal genetic factor for embryonic mortality in cattle as well as mice. as the cnvr has no effects on economically valuable meat traits in japanese black cattle, the elimination of the cnvr from the population will be useful in reducing embryonic mortality rates of japanese black cattle without adverse economic effects.
