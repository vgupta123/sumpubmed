BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is a halophilic, gram-negative bacterium, first discovered in  <dig> during a food poisoning outbreak in osaka, japan. v. parahaemolyticus is a seafood-borne pathogen, which is a major causative agent of gastroenteritis particularly in regions with high seafood consumption. in taiwan, japan, and south east asian countries, v. parahaemolyticus causes over half of all food poisoning outbreaks of bacterial origin  <cit> . in recent years outbreaks of v. parahaemolyticus infection have increased in the united states; and v. parahaemolyticus infection is estimated to be responsible for  <dig> illnesses per year  <cit> . v. parahaemolyticus infections that caused gastroenteritis up until  <dig> were associated with many different serotypes, with a predominance of o <dig> serogroup strains among clinical samples in the united states  <cit> . in  <dig> the first appearance of a pandemic v. parahaemolyticus clone occurred, a new o3:k <dig> serotype strain that has now been identified worldwide as a major cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis  <cit> .

clinical isolates of v. parahaemolyticus produce two major virulence factors; the thermostable direct hemolysin  encoded by tdh, and tdh-related hemolysin encoded by trh. several studies have demonstrated that most pandemic v. parahaemolyticus new o3:k <dig> serotype isolates contain the tdh gene but not the trh gene and are hemolytic on wagatsuma agar designated kanagawa phenomenon positive strains   <cit> . a number of additional biomarkers have been identified in pandemic v. parahaemolyticus serotype o3:k <dig> isolates; these include a unique toxrs sequence, a histone-like dna-binding protein and an open reading frame vp <dig>  all found to be present exclusively in these strains  <cit> . the recently emerged serotypes o4:k <dig>  o1:kut, o1:k <dig> and o1:k <dig> have been shown to be clonally related to new o3:k <dig> serotype strains isolated after  <dig>  all forming a pandemic group  <cit> . it had been suggested that the new o3:k <dig> group strains might have emerged as a result of the transfer of genetic elements, and the v. parahaemolyticus phage f <dig> is believed to be responsible for the pandemic potential of v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> . however, many post- <dig> v. parahaemolyticus isolates lack phage f <dig>  <cit> .

genomic islands  are another group of chromosomal regions, which are acquired by horizontal gene transfer that may increase fitness of the bacterium in a particular environment. for example, virulence genes present on pathogenicity islands or genes that provide diverse metabolic capabilities on metabolic islands can play an important role in bacterial survival in diverse environments  <cit> . the dna sequences of gis are compositionally biased from their host genome in terms of g+c content, genome signature  and codon usage patterns  <cit> . as well as aberrant dna composition, gis have the general characteristics of encoding a bacteriophage-like integrase, are flanked by repeat sequences, and many gis insert adjacent to trna genes probably indicating a similar mechanism of chromosomal integration. gis are usually present in a subset of strains of a species and absent from closely related species. from the genomic sequence of v. parahaemolyticus rimd <dig>  an  <dig> kb region on chromosome  <dig> with a g+c content of 39% compared to the overall g+c content for the entire genome of 45% was identified  <cit> . this potential pathogenicity island encoded a type iii secretion  system, which in other pathogenic bacteria export bacterial proteins directly into host cells. the tts system on chromosome  <dig> was shown only to be present among v. parahaemolyticus isolates recovered after  <dig>  <cit> .

in the present study, we interrogated the complete genome sequence of v. parahaemolyticus strain rimd <dig> an o3:k <dig> strain clinical isolate by bioinformatic and molecular analyses to identify gis that may mark pandemic isolates. we uncovered  <dig> regions, ranging in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb with the characteristics of gis. we named these  <dig> regions vibrio parahaemolyticus island- <dig>  to vpai- <dig>  we examined the distribution of vpai- <dig> among a collection of  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus natural isolates recovered between  <dig> and  <dig>  by molecular analyses, the vpai- <dig> region was only present amongst post- <dig> serotype o3:k <dig> and related pandemic isolates indicating that this region may play a role in the emergence of pandemic isolates. in addition, we investigated the distribution of vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig>  and vpai- <dig> among the same collection of v. parahaemolyticus isolates and all  <dig> regions gave a similar distribution as vpai- <dig> indicating that these regions, which encoded a number of potential virulence genes, may be involved in the emergence of pandemic isolates.

RESULTS
genomic islands  identified in v. parahaemolyticus rimd2210633
we examined the whole genome sequence of v. parahaemolyticus rimd <dig> to identify gis that could potentially mark this pandemic clone. initially we identified  <dig> regions of greater than  <dig> kb with aberrant g+c content that encoded integrase or transposase genes. these  <dig> regions included a prophage and an integron as well as  <dig> additional regions, which we named v. parahaemolyticus island- <dig>  to vpai- <dig>  the  <dig> genomic islands  ranged in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb, were flanked by direct repeats, and  <dig> of the  <dig> gis had a g+c content lower  than the overall genome g+c content of 45% . all gis encoded an integrase gene with the exception of vpai- <dig>  which contained a number of transposase genes. vpai- <dig> is an  <dig> kb region that encoded a tts system and the tdh gene and was previously identified as a potential pathogenicity island   <cit> . five gi regions were present on chromosome  <dig> and two on chromosome  <dig>  four of the gis identified inserted adjacent to trna genes; vpai- <dig> , vpai- <dig> , vpai- <dig>  and vpai- <dig>  . using the program developed by van passel and co-workers, we examined the compositional dissimilarities among the  <dig> vpai regions identified compared to the host genome   <cit> . a high genomic dissimilarity  between a vpai region and the v. parahaemolyticus genome sequence indicates a heterologous origin of the gi. all  <dig> vpai regions that we examined had high δ* values compared to the average for the genome of  <dig> for chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> for chromosome  <dig>  . in addition, we investigated the percent of genomic fragments of sizes equal to each vpai with lower δ* and between  <dig> and  <dig> percent of genomic fragments examined had a lower δ* than the gi examined indicating that the  <dig> vpai regions uncovered had an aberrant base composition compared to the rest of the genome .

comparative analysis
each orf present in the  <dig> vpai regions was analysed systematically by blast analysis to determine whether these regions were present in sequenced members of the family vibrionaceae; v. vulnificus strains yj <dig> and cmcp <dig>  v. cholerae n <dig>  and v. fischeri es <dig>  for all gis, no homologues were present in these sequenced genomes. however, it was noted that four of the homologous insertion sites trna-met, tmrna, and two trna-ser loci, did contain unique dna in each of the four vibrio genome sequences examined. at the trna-met locus  in the v. parahaemolyticus rimd <dig> sequence, we identified the  <dig> kb vpai- <dig> region . the vpai- <dig> region encompassed orfs vp <dig> to vp <dig> and encoded a phage-like integrase, type i restriction endonuclease, haemagglutinin associated protein, transmembrane protein, transcriptional regulators as well as a number of hypothetical proteins. previously, we identified the homologous trna-met locus as a hotspot for insertion of novel dna in v. vulnificus and v. cholerae isolates  <cit> . at this site in both species a novel genomic island was inserted; in v. vulnificus yj <dig>  a  <dig> kb v. vulnificus island-i  was present and in v. cholerae o <dig> biotype el tor pandemic strains, the  <dig> kb vibrio seventh pandemic island-ii  was present   <cit> . in both v. vulnificus cmcp <dig> and v. fischeri es <dig> the homologous trna-met insertion site contained no novel dna. in v. vulnificus cmcp <dig> the two homologous core chromosomal vpai- <dig> flanking genes were adjacent to one another, whereas in v. fischeri es <dig> only one flanking gene was identified . at the tmrna site  in v. parahaemolyticus rimd <dig>  the vpai- <dig> region is present, which encompassed orfs vp <dig> to vp <dig> and encoded an integrase, outer membrane protein, a resolvase, a ribonuclease h <dig> protein as well as a number of hypothetical proteins . at the homologous tmrna site in v. vulnificus yj <dig> a  <dig> kb island region was present and in v. vulnificus strain cmcp <dig> a  <dig> kb region was present  <cit> . in v. cholerae, the  <dig> kb vibrio pathogenicity island- <dig>  region, which encodes the toxin co-regulated pilus, was present  <cit> . in v. fischeri es <dig> at the homologous tmrna site a  <dig> kb region was present, which showed homology to prophage genes. at a trna-ser site  in v. parahaemolyticus rimd <dig> the  <dig> kb vpai- <dig> region was present . the vpai- <dig> region encompasses orfs vp <dig> to vp <dig> and encoded an integrase, a signal transduction histidine kinase, a helicase, a methyl accepting chemotaxis protein, an acrbdf family protein as well as numerous hypothetical proteins. in v. vulnificus at the homologous insertion site, a  <dig> kb region was present and in cmcp <dig> a  <dig> kb region with homology to the  <dig> kb region in yj <dig> was present   <cit> . at the homologous site in v. cholerae the  <dig> kb vpi- <dig> region, which encoded neuraminidase and genes required for sialic acid metabolism, was present  <cit> . in v. fischeri es <dig> at this site no horizontally acquired dna was present . in v. parahaemolyticus rimd <dig>  at a second trna-ser site  the  <dig> kb vpai- <dig> region was present encompassing orfs vp <dig> to vp <dig> . the vpai- <dig> region encoded an integrase, a putative pore forming cytotoxin integrase, an m protein, an atpase, a histone deacetylase as well as a number of hypothetical proteins. the m protein is a classical bacterial surface expressed virulence factor and the cytotoxin integrase may also be a potential virulence factor. at the homologous trna-ser site in both v. vulnificus strains yj <dig> and cmcp <dig> a  <dig>  kb region of unique dna was present . however, at the homologous sites in v. cholerae n <dig> and v. fischeri es <dig> no novel dna was present, and in v. cholerae the core flanking island genes were adjacent to one another . the  <dig> kb vpai- <dig> region encompassed orfs vp <dig> to vp <dig> . vpai- <dig> encoded in addition to two integrases, a number of unknown and hypothetical proteins. the homologous core chromosomal flanking genes of vpai- <dig> in v. vulnificus strains yj <dig> and cmcp <dig>  v. cholerae n <dig> and v. fischeri es <dig> were adjacent to one another indicating the absence of novel dna at this site . the  <dig> kb vpai- <dig> region encompassed vpa <dig> to vpa <dig> and encoded an integrase,  <dig>   <dig> dihydroxy-2-butanone- <dig> phos  synthase, two putative colicin proteins, a hydrolase and a number of hypothetical proteins. the homologous core chromosomal flanking genes of vpai- <dig> in v. vulnificus strains yj <dig> and cmcp <dig>  v. cholerae n <dig> and v. fischeri es <dig> were either dispersed on the genome or were absent . the  <dig> kb vpai- <dig> region encompassed vpa <dig> to vpa <dig> encoded a tts system previously described by makino and colleagues  <cit> .

distribution of vpai- <dig> among pre- <dig> and post- <dig> isolates
since the trna-met site in v. cholerae isolates contained dna  unique to pandemic isolates, we decided to examine this region further among v. parahaemolyticus isolates  <cit> . to determine whether vpai- <dig> is unique to pandemic v. parahaemolyticus, we examined a collection of  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus strains encompassing various serotypes recovered from a range of geographic regions over a  <dig> year period. the v. parahaemolyticus strains examined included  <dig> serotype o3:k <dig> isolates recovered between  <dig> and 1995;  <dig> serotype o3:k <dig> isolates recovered between  <dig> and 1998;  <dig> isolates representing serotypes o1:kut, o1:k <dig> , o2:k <dig>  o3:k <dig>  o3:k <dig>  o4:k <dig>  o4:k <dig> , o4:k <dig>  and o8:k <dig>  and  <dig> strain of undetermined serotype . these  <dig> isolates were further characterized using the differences in toxrs nucleotide sequence first described by matsumoto and co-workers, which they called a group specific pcr  that has been shown to differentiate post- <dig> pandemic strains from non-pandemic and pre- <dig> isolates   <cit> . of the  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus strains examined using gs-pcr,  <dig> strains gave a positive pcr band of the expected size and  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus isolates did not yield any pcr product . one toxrs-positive strain  <dig> was previously shown by wong and colleagues to belong to the old o3:k <dig> group and in their analysis this strain gave no pcr band with the same primer pair  <cit> . our result suggests that the isolate we examined was not the same  <dig> strain. we sequenced the housekeeping gene malate dehydrogenase  from strain  <dig> using a primer pair designed from the sequenced strain rimd <dig>  the mdh nucleotide sequence from strain  <dig> differed by only one nucleotide from the rimd <dig> mdh sequence indicating they are very closely related strains. one additional strain gave anomalous results compared to a previous study, where ke <dig> was shown by osawa and colleagues to give positive pcr results with the toxrs primer pair  <cit> . it appears that there may have been a mix up in strain numbering in the distribution of these strains.

a total of  <dig> primer pairs were used to determine the distribution of vpai- <dig> among  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus natural isolates . six primer pairs were designed within the vpai- <dig> region, two primer pairs encompassing each of the vpai- <dig> flanking core chromosomal genes, vp <dig> and vp <dig>  and a primer pair comprised of a forward primer from vp <dig> and a reverse primer designed from vp <dig> . of the  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus strains examined by pcr with  <dig> primer pairs encompassing the vpai- <dig> region ,  <dig> strains gave positive pcr bands of the expected sizes indicating the presence of vpai- <dig> in these strains . for example, pcr assays with primer pair vp0388f/vp0392r on dna from the  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus isolates, gave an expected size product of  <dig>  kb with  <dig> strains . the  <dig> pcr positive strains were all recovered post- <dig> and had a worldwide distribution ;  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus serotype o3:k <dig> strains,  <dig> serotype o4:k <dig> strain recovered in taiwan in  <dig>   <dig> serotype o1:kut recovered in bangladesh and  <dig> serotype o1:k <dig> strains recovered in taiwan and thailand in  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> serotype o4:k <dig> strains recovered in  <dig> and  <dig> in bangladesh, singapore and taiwan . these vpai- <dig> positive isolates were the same set of isolates that gave positive pcr products with the gs-pcr primer pair . all v. parahaemolyticus strains recovered pre- <dig> gave negative pcr results for the six primer pairs encompassing vpai- <dig> as well as five strains isolated in spain and taiwan between  <dig> and  <dig> . all pcr negative results were confirmed by southern hybridisation analysis using dna probes encompassing vp <dig> to vp <dig>  of the  <dig> vpai- <dig> negative v. parahaemolyticus isolates,  <dig> were negative for the gs-pcr assay, the exception being strain ke <dig> .

to determine whether in each of the vpai-1-positve strains the chromosomal insertion site was identical, a primer pair was designed which comprised of a forward primer within vp <dig>  the 5' core vpai- <dig> flanking gene, and a reverse primer within vp <dig>  the first gene within the island. for all vpai-1-positive isolates, a  <dig>  kb pcr product was obtained . to confirm that the vpai- <dig> regions examined by pcr assays were contiguous within each isolate, overlapping pcr was carried out using three sets of primer pairs on vpai-1-positive strains only . for example, a primer pair encompassing vp <dig> to vp <dig> was used to amplify a  <dig> kb product from all vpai-1-positives isolates, indicating that this region is contiguous with vp0382-vp <dig> amongst these isolates .

as expected, positive pcr results with primer pairs marking 5' vp <dig> and 3' vp <dig> core chromosomal vpai- <dig> flanking genes were obtained for all  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus strains, indicating that these genes are present in all isolates . thus, primer pair vp0379f/vp0379r and vp0404f/vp0404r gave a  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb pcr product with all  <dig> strains tested . to determine whether in vpai-1-negative isolates these core chromosomal genes  are adjacent to one another, we carried out a pcr assay with a forward primer  designed from vp <dig> and a reverse primer  designed from vp <dig> . we found that among the  <dig> isolates that did not contain the vpai- <dig> region,  <dig> strains gave a positive pcr band of  <dig>  kb indicating that in these strains vp <dig> and vp <dig> are adjacent to one another and the insertion site for vpai- <dig> is empty . two vpai- <dig> negative strains, 428/ <dig> and  <dig> recovered in spain  <dig> and  <dig>  did not yield a pcr product with the primer pair 379f and 404r, which suggested that additional dna may be present in these strains at this region . we performed long range pcr on both of these isolates and obtained a  <dig> kb product indicating that in these isolates  <dig> kb of novel dna is present . further analysis by southern hybridisation using a dna probe from the 379f/404r primer pair pcr product from strain ke <dig>  showed the expected band sizes from strain 428/ <dig> and  <dig>  hybridisation of ecor <dig> digested rimd <dig> dna with the 379/ <dig> probe produced the expected size bands of  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb . hybridisation of ecori digested ke <dig> and ke <dig> dna  with the 379/ <dig> probe gave an expected  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb bands indicating that in these strains this trna-met site is empty. strains  <dig> and 428/ <dig> gave an approximately  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb size bands with the 379/ <dig> dna probe indicating that in these strains a  <dig> kb fragment of dna is present between vp <dig> and vp <dig> .

distribution of vpai- <dig> among v. parahaemolyticus
to further examine the possible link between the acquisition of novel dna and the emergence of pandemic isolates, we investigated the presence of three additional regions  among our collection of  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus isolates. for molecular analyses of vpai- <dig>   <dig> primer pairs designed from strain rimd <dig> encompassing the  <dig> kb region and the core 5' and 3' vpai- <dig> core chromosomal flanking genes were used . the  <dig> internal vpai- <dig> primer pairs gave pcr products of the expected size with dna template from each of  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates examined . these were the same  <dig> isolates that were positive for the presence of vpai- <dig> . for both the 5' and 3' core chromosomal vpai- <dig> flanking primer pairs the expected size pcr products were obtained for all  <dig> isolates examined indicating that they represent core ancestral genes . a pcr assay based on a primer pair binding to chromosomal regions flanking the vpai- <dig> region was used to determine whether in vpai-4-negative strains the flanking genes are adjacent to one another. as expected only the  <dig> vpai-4-negative v. parahaemolyticus isolates gave a  <dig>  kb pcr product with the primer pair designed from the 5' and 3' flanking genes . no pcr products were obtained with vpai- <dig> positive strains since the distance between the primer binding sites is too large . this result showed that in vpai-4-negative isolates the core chromosomal vpai- <dig> flanking genes are adjacent to one another.

to show that in each of the vpai-4-positive strains that the chromosomal insertion site was identical, a primer pair was designed that comprised of a forward primer within vpai- <dig> gene vp <dig> and a reverse primer within the 3' core chromosomal flanking gene vp <dig> . for all vpai-4-positive isolates, an expected  <dig>  kb pcr product was obtained . to confirm that the vpai- <dig> regions examined by pcr assays were contiguous within each isolate, overlapping pcr was carried out using an additional three sets of primer pairs . a primer pair encompassing vp <dig> to vp <dig> was used to amplify a  <dig>  kb product from all vpai-4-positives isolates, indicating that this region is contiguous with vp2137-vp <dig> . identical results were obtained with primer pairs encompassing vp <dig> to vp <dig> and vp <dig> to vp <dig> showing that these regions are contiguous. thus it appears that in vpai-4-positive isolates the structure and size of the island among the isolates is similar.

distribution of vpai- <dig> among v. parahaemolyticus
three primer pairs encompassing the  <dig> kb vpai- <dig> region were used to examine the  <dig> v. parahaemolyticus isolates . for all primer pairs,  <dig> isolates gave a pcr product of the expected size, these were the same  <dig> isolates that were positive for the presence of vpai- <dig> and vpai- <dig> . the  <dig> vpai-5-negative isolates gave a  <dig>  kb pcr product with a primer pair designed from the 5' and 3' core chromosomal vpai- <dig> flanking genes vp <dig> and vp <dig> respectively, indicating that these genes are adjacent to one another and no novel dna is present in these isolates .

by pcr assay we show that in each of the vpai-5-positive strains the insertion site of the island was identical, with a forward primer within the 5' core chromosomal flanking gene vp <dig> and a reverse primer within the first gene of vpai- <dig> vp <dig> . from all vpai-5-positive isolates an expected  <dig> kb pcr product was obtained indicating that the island is inserted at the same site in all strains tested . to confirm that the vpai- <dig> regions examined by pcr assays were contiguous within each isolate, overlapping pcr was carried out using an additional  <dig> sets of primer pairs . dna from all vpai-4-positives isolates by pcr assay amplified a  <dig>  kb product with a primer pair encompassing vp <dig> to vp <dig> . identical results were obtained with primer pairs encompassing vp <dig> to vp <dig> and vp <dig> to vp <dig> with dna from vpai-5-positive isolates as template for pcr assays.

distribution of vpai- <dig> among v. parahaemolyticus
to determine the distribution of vpai- <dig>  encoded on chromosome  <dig>  we used  <dig> primer pairs spanning the  <dig> kb region. similar to the results for vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig>  and vpai- <dig>  the same set of  <dig> isolates gave a pcr product of the expected size with each primer pair . a primer pair designed within vpa <dig> and vpa <dig>  and a primer pair within vpa <dig> all gave a positive pcr product with all strains examined indicating that these genes represent core chromosomal flanking genes . the  <dig> vpai-6-negative strains gave an expected size pcr product of  <dig>  kb with a primer pair designed from the 5' and 3' flanking genes  indicating that these genes are adjacent to one another in these strains .

the insertion site of vpai- <dig> among all isolates was examined by pcr assay with a forward primer within the 5' core chromosomal flanking gene vpa <dig> and a reverse primer within the first gene of vpai- <dig>  vpa <dig> . for dna from all vpai-6-positive isolates an expected  <dig>  kb pcr product was obtained indicating that the island is inserted at the same site in all strains tested . to confirm that the vpai- <dig> regions examined by pcr assays were contiguous within each isolate, overlapping pcr was carried out using additional sets of primer pairs . all vpai-6-positive isolates by pcr assays, amplified a  <dig>  kb pcr product with a primer pair encompassing vpa <dig> to vpa <dig>  a  <dig> kb pcr product with primer pair vpa1256f/vpa1259r, a  <dig>  kb product with a primer pair encompassing vpa <dig> to vpa <dig>  and a  <dig>  pcr product with vpa1264f/vpa1268r . similar to vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig> and vpai- <dig>  it appears that in vpai-6-positive isolates, the island region has a similar structure and size among all the isolates examined.

investigation of excision of vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig> and vpai-6
the integrase  genes of vpai- <dig> and vpai- <dig> exhibit homology to the int genes of coliphage p <dig> and bacteriophage phi ctx, respectively. the int genes of vpai- <dig> and vpai- <dig> show significant identities with other bacteriophages. in addition, vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig> and vpai- <dig> are flanked by direct repeats, which could be equivalent to the left and right attachment sites  that result from the integration of phage dna. therefore, it is possible that vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig> and vpai- <dig> may excise from the v. parahaemolyticus genome similar to e. coli pais, which have similar features, and form circular intermediates via site specific recombination between the direct repeats  <cit> . to determine the stability and potential mobility of vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig>  and vpai- <dig>  an inverse pcr assay was carried out to test for the presence of circular intermediates that result from excision of island regions . total dna was extracted from overnight cultures treated with and without mitomycin c . pcr was carried out using a primer pair oriented towards the 5' and 3' island chromosomal flanking genes . a pcr product can only be amplified if the island regions have excised and formed circular intermediates with the primer binding sites oriented towards one another . circular intermediates could not be detected under the conditions examined in this study for any of the  <dig> island regions tested. the deletion rate of these islands maybe very low and our pcr assay may not have been sensitive enough.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified  <dig> regions named vpai- <dig> to vpai- <dig>  which had all the features of genomic islands that is aberrant base composition compared to the entire genome, the presence of a phage-like integrase, insertion adjacent to trna genes and variable presence among strains. a number of the vpai regions  encoded putative virulence genes  and therefore these regions may represent potential pathogenicity islands. vpai- <dig> encoded a type  <dig> restriction modification gene cluster, which could potentially be involved in protecting the bacterium from viral infections . however, all the vpai regions encoded a large proportion of hypothetical and unknown proteins. we examined the  <dig> kb vpai- <dig> region among a range of pandemic and non-pandemic v. parahaemolyticus isolates recovered over the past  <dig> years. we determined that vpai- <dig> was unique to the pandemic group of v. parahaemolyticus strains isolated after  <dig>  further analysis of  <dig> additional regions, vpai- <dig>  vpai- <dig>  and vpai- <dig> showed that these too were unique to the pandemic clone, indicating that the acquisition of novel dna by horizontal gene transfer has played an important role in the emergence of these strains. the  <dig> kb vpai- <dig> region encompassing vp <dig> to vp <dig> encodes orf vp <dig>  which was previously shown to be associated with the pandemic group of v. parahaemolyticus isolates  <cit> . the vpai- <dig> region was previously noted by okura and co-workers to encode a phage-like protein and may therefore encode a phage  <cit> . previous studies examining the presence of strain specific dna among pathogenic v. cholerae isolates have shown that the acquisition of dna encoding virulence genes has played a crucial role in the emergence of pandemic isolates of this species  <cit> . the emergence of a novel epidemic v. cholerae o <dig> serogroup in  <dig> was shown to have resulted from the horizontal transfer of the o <dig> gene cluster into an o <dig> serogroup strain as well as the acquisition of a capsule polysaccharide and an integrative conjugative element  <cit> . the insertion of  <dig> of our vpai regions adjacent to trna genes has previously been described for a number of gis in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . more recently it has been noted that there is a bias in the integration of gis into specific trna loci  <cit> . as the vpai regions described in this study are examined further their role in the emergence of a pandemic clone will be elucidated. the recent discovery that v. cholerae isolates are naturally competent in the presence of chitin, an abundant substrate in the aquatic environment, may indicate a possible mechanism of dna acquisition among the vibrionaceae  <cit> .
