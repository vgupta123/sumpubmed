BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic proteins  and other members of the transforming growth factor-β  superfamily, like the activins, growth and differentiation factors  and tgf-βs are secreted signaling proteins that regulate the development, maintenance and regeneration of tissues and organs  <cit> . their importance in the development of multicellular organisms is visible from their existence in all vertebrates and non-vertebrate animals. the number of different tgf-β members correlates with the complexity of the organism, with four members found in c. elegans  <cit> , seven members in d. melanogaster  <cit>  and more than  <dig> members in men  <cit> . dysregulation of signaling of tgf-β like proteins leads to a variety of diseases, including skeletal malformations  <cit> , osteoporosis  <cit> , cardiovascular and metabolic diseases  <cit> , muscular disorders  <cit> , and cancer  <cit> .

members of the tgf-β superfamily bind two different types of serine/threonine-kinase receptors termed type i and type ii receptors  <cit> . both receptor subtypes share a common architecture, i.e. a small extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine-kinase domain. the kinase domains of type i and type ii receptors share a high level of amino acid sequence similarity. however a glycine/serine-rich segment – the gs box – in the membrane-proximal part of the intracellular domain is unique to the type i receptors. in general, ligand binding induces hetero-oligomerization of type i and type ii receptors initiating the intracellular signaling cascade. the constitutively active type ii serine/threonine-kinase transphosphorylates the type i receptor at the gs box thereby activating the type i kinase  <cit> . the latter subsequently activates smad proteins, which dimerize and migrate to the nucleus, where they, in concert with other proteins, function as transcription factors to regulate responsive genes  <cit> . two smad pathways exist. smad-2/- <dig> are activated by activins and tgf-βs and smad-1/-5/- <dig> are activated by bmps and a subset of gdfs. recent discoveries however show that other signaling pathways involving the map kinase pathway or small g proteins like ras might be directly addressed by tgf-β members  <cit> . proteomics approaches also identified various adaptor and other proteins associated with the intracellular domain of the bmp type ii receptor suggesting that signaling of tgf-βs and bmps might be more complex than the well-examined smad pathway  <cit> .

signal transduction of tgf-β proteins is highly controlled at several levels; a manifold of modulator proteins in the extracellular space vary the activities of these factors  <cit> . although they are often termed antagonists there are also examples of modulator proteins leading to an increase in receptor-mediated activity  <cit> . pseudo receptors as well as co-receptors can either inhibit or modulate signaling at the membrane surface level  <cit> . inside the cell various possibilities exist to adjust or interrupt the activity, e.g. by inhibitory smad proteins, phosphatases to counteract the receptor kinase activity  <cit> , ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis of the receptors/smads  <cit>  or by transcriptional repressors  <cit> .

one important feature of the tgf-β superfamily is the limited specificity of its ligand-receptor interactions. for more than  <dig> ligands only seven type i receptors and five type ii receptors are known. thus one receptor of a particular subtype has to bind several different ligands. but even though the ligands outnumber the available receptors, several bmps and gdfs have been shown to interact with several different receptor chains of both type i and type ii. however, preferences seem to exist. for instance bmp- <dig> uses preferentially bmpr-ia and bmpr-ib less so  <cit> , gdf- <dig> prefers bmpr-ib  <cit>  and bmp- <dig> actr-i  <cit> . an especially intriguing situation exists with the type ii activin receptors actr-ii and actr-iib which interact with different bmps, activins, gdf-8/- <dig> and nodal  <cit> . ligand specific patterns seem to exist for type i and type ii receptors. recent clinical and biochemical studies on gdf- <dig> have shown that the receptor specificity profile of a ligand can be absolutely crucial for its biological functions  <cit> . this underlines the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these relative binding affinities are generated.

in the present study we analyze the interaction of bmp- <dig> with its type i receptor bmpr-ia and its type ii receptor actr-iib. bmp- <dig> is a prototypical member of the tgf-β superfamily with respect to ligand-receptor promiscuity. it binds with high-affinity to both type i receptors bmpr-ia and bmpr-ib; three different type ii receptors, i.e. bmpr-ii, actr-ii and actr-iib can be recruited to yield a signaling hetero-oligomeric complex  <cit> . the usage of the activin type ii receptors is especially interesting as they exhibit a dual specificity and affinity  <cit> . actr-ii and actr-iib bind activin a  with high affinity in the low nanomolar range leading to activation of the smad-2/- <dig> pathway, whereas binding of bmp- <dig> occurs with low-affinity in the micromolar range resulting in the activation of the smad-1/-5/- <dig> pathway. since act-a and bmps can exhibit opposing activities  <cit> , which are regulated by competition for the activin type ii receptors, it is important to know how the binding affinity to both ligand subgroups activins and bmps can be changed by orders of magnitude.

here we describe in a structure-/function analysis how binding specificity of the type ii receptor actr-iib for different ligands as well as of bmp- <dig> for different type ii receptors is encoded on a single-amino acid level. a single mutation in bmp- <dig> selectively enhances the binding affinity for bmpr-ii. exchange of two other amino acids results in a nearly 100-fold increase in affinity particular for type ii receptor actr-iib without affecting the binding affinities to the other receptors. remarkably, a "silent h-bond" is thereby converted into a hot spot of binding energy, which also exists in act-a.

RESULTS
architecture and assembly of the ternary ligand-receptor complex
the crystal structure of the ternary ligand-receptor complex of wildtype bmp- <dig> shows a dimeric ligand bound to only one bmpr-iaecd and actr-iibecd occupying the expected wrist  and knuckle epitopes . both receptor ectodomains are located on the same half of the dimeric ligand , with the binding sites being almost identical to those identified in the crystal structures of the complexes bmp-2:bmpr-ia  <cit>  and bmp-7:actr-ii  <cit> . the change in ligand-receptor stoichiometry in the crystal is clearly due to crystal packing as sds-page and rp-hplc analyses proved this complex to be hexameric in solution . inspection of the crystal lattice contacts shows that symmetry-related proteins block the empty epitopes.

in a second analysis a bmp- <dig> variant with enhanced affinity for actr-iib  was used for complex preparation and crystallization. crystals from this complex comprising the bmp- <dig> variant l100k/n102d were obtained under different crystallization conditions and exhibit distinct morphology. analysis of this complex yielded a hexameric ligand-receptor arrangement with all receptor binding epitopes occupied as expected for the dimeric bmp- <dig> .

inspection of the receptor-ligand interactions of both bmp-2/receptor complexes , or wildtype bmp- <dig>  in the following termed ternary complex ) demonstrates that the ligand-receptor interfaces are highly similar. superposition of the complexes yields an r.m.s. deviation of  <dig>  Å for the cα atoms of bmp- <dig>  only "bound" parts of bmp- <dig> were considered), and  <dig>  Å for the cα of bmp- <dig> and actr-iibecd . thus, the different crystal forms and the employed mutant protein did not alter the general fold or the assembly of bmp- <dig> and the receptors. this indicates that the core parts of these proteins are rigid and that no major conformational changes take place during complex formation.

the type i receptor bmpr-iaecd occupies the wrist epitope of bmp- <dig> , whereas the type ii receptor actr-iibecd is located on top of finger  <dig> of bmp- <dig> consistent with the knuckle epitope identified by mutagenesis  <cit> . this binding site overlaps almost perfectly with that of actr-iib in the structures of the act-a: <dig> complex  <cit> . a comparison with the actr-ii binding site in the structure of the complex bmp-7: <dig>  <cit>  shows that the site of actr-ii however is shifted slightly away from the fingertips. in the recently published structure of another bmp- <dig> ternary ligand-receptor complex comprising of bmpr-iaecd and actr-iiecd  <cit> , the binding site of actr-ii is, however, identical with that of actr-iib in our complex structures. this observation suggests that the type ii receptor location in the knuckle epitope is probably dependent on the nature of the ligand, here bmp- <dig> or bmp- <dig>  the slight shift of the epitope might represent one possible mechanism for generating ligand specific receptor recognition.

in contrast, in other tgf-β ligand-receptor complexes, e.g. act-a:actr-iibecd and tgf-β3:tβr-ii, the ligand structures differ vastly in the free and bound form  <cit> . the cause for the large changes in the dimer architecture of act-a and tgf-βs is yet unclear, but is probably not due to receptor binding itself. inspection of the backbone dynamics in tgf-β <dig> using nmr-relaxation methods reveals an inherent flexibility in the tgf-β molecule  <cit> , which might result in an dynamic equilibrium between an open and a closed dimer architecture for tgf-βs and possibly also activins  <cit> . in contrast, bmp- <dig> seems not to change its overall dimer architecture upon binding to either type i or both receptor subtypes. accordingly, in the absence of gross conformational changes binding affinities of actr-iib for bmp- <dig> alone or for bmp- <dig> complexed with bmpr-iaecd are identical . our current structural data also excludes the possibility that the binding cooperativity for the type ii receptor observed for bmp- <dig> in cell-based experiments  <cit>  results from direct contacts between the receptor ectodomains as proposed for the tgf-βs  <cit> . the closest proximity between the ectodomains of either subtype measures about  <dig> Å . involvement of the intracellular domains of the receptors in the generation of binding cooperativity has been ruled out by binding experiments using truncated receptors  <cit> .

an alternative model suggests interaction of the transmembrane segments as a possible source for cooperativity. however, the distance between the c-termini of both actr-iibecd  is about  <dig> Å and the c-termini of bmpr-iaecd are separated by approx.  <dig> Å. the distance between the traceable c-termini of the receptor ectodomains bmpr-ia and actr-iib measures about  <dig> Å. modeling of the missing c-terminal peptide sequences – no electron density is observed for the six c-terminal residues of bmpr-iaecd and  <dig> residues of actr-iibecd – shows that contacts between all four transmembrane helices are impossible due to steric restraints by the ligand. only hetero-dimeric interactions between the transmembrane helices of one bmpr-ia and one actr-iib receptor residing on the same half of the bmp- <dig> ligand are possible .

ternary complex formation does not alter type i ligand-receptor core interface
although the global fold of bmp- <dig> is not affected by the binding of both receptor subtypes, small locally restricted changes in backbone and side chain conformations are observed in the wrist and knuckle epitopes of both ternary complexes. the binding of bmp- <dig> to its high-affinity receptor bmpr-iaecd causes a local induced fit in the so-called pre-helix segment  of bmp- <dig>  <cit> . in free bmp- <dig> this segment exhibits high temperature factors but upon type i receptor binding temperature factors within this segment drop to low values also observed in the core of the binary complex bmp-2:bmpr-iaecd.

interestingly, binding of actr-iib to the binary complex bmp-2:bmpr-iaecd results in a small but significant reorientation of bmpr-ia. this reorientation is identical in both ternary complexes, comprising wildtype bmp- <dig> as well as the double variant bmp-2l100k/n102d. thus the allosteric change in the assembly is neither dependent on the stoichiometry nor on the difference in affinity to the type ii receptor actr-iib. the bmpr-ia molecule changes its tilt angle by about 8° compared to the binary complex of bmpr-ia bound to bmp- <dig> . the axis of rotation runs through the type i interface core, i.e. residue gln <dig> of bmpr-ia, perpendicular to the dyad of the complex. the movement of bmpr-ia seems to be initiated by small structural changes in the backbone conformation of residues  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> in the β-strands  <dig> and  <dig> of finger  <dig> of bmp- <dig>  both strands move towards actr-iib up to  <dig>  Å and this change seems to be propagated to the wrist epitope . the structure of bmpr-ia remains unaltered and the bmp- <dig> molecule is therefore the sole source of the observed structural plasticity. as a result, residues located far from the axis of rotation show the largest displacement, e.g. residues in the loops β1β <dig> and β3β <dig> of bmpr-ia move by almost  <dig> Å . in contrast, residues in the type i ligand-receptor interface core are not affected; nine intermolecular hydrogen bonds  observed in the core of the wrist epitope of bmp- <dig> and bmpr-iaecd of the binary complex are also found in both ternary complexes  and their geometrical parameters  are preserved.

for the recently published structure of the ternary ligand-receptor complex of bmp- <dig> bound to bmpr-ia and actr-ii, no such rearrangement for the type i receptor binding has been described  <cit> . a detailed comparison of this complex structure with those of this study reveals that the change in type i receptor orientation is significantly smaller; the tilt angle of bmpr-ia changes by only 3° compared to its location in the bmp-2:bmpr-iaecd binary complex. consistently, the change in backbone conformation of the β-strands  <dig> and  <dig> of bmp- <dig> in the complex of allendorph et al. is also smaller, e.g. the distance between the cα atoms of asn <dig> of the binary and ternary complex is  <dig> Å . although the physiological role of the type i receptor rearrangement is yet unknown – our biacore study clearly shows that type ii receptor ectodomain binding to bmp- <dig> is independent of the presence of a type i receptor – the comparison suggests that the different change in type i receptor orientation might be dependent on the nature of the type ii receptor.

analysis of solvent molecules in the bmp- <dig> type i receptor interface has shown that the main-binding determinants of the bmp- <dig> – type i receptor interaction are surrounded by tightly bound water molecules, which seem to play an important role in the ligand-receptor recognition mechanism. of these water molecules in the type i receptor-ligand interface of the binary complex  <cit> , all  are found in identical positions in the ternary complexes of this study and the ternary complex structure published by allendorph et al.  <cit>  although the crystallization conditions differ significantly. this corroborates our hypothesis that interface water molecules play an important role in the ligand-type i receptor recognition possibly by generating a major part of the structural plasticity of bmp- <dig>  <cit> . in summary, despite the reorientation of bmpr-ia upon recruitment of the type ii receptor ectodomain, the binding epitope of the type i receptor remains unaltered.

the ligand-type ii receptor core interface is predominantly hydrophobic
the β-strands  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of actr-iib together with β <dig> and β <dig> of bmp- <dig> form the major part of the binding interface . a part of the loop of finger  <dig> of bmp- <dig> also contacts actr-iib. in total,  <dig> residues of bmp- <dig> and  <dig> residues of actr-iib  contribute significantly to the interface. remarkably, in comparison with the ternary complex of bmp- <dig> bound to bmpr-ia and actr-ii the backbone conformation of the bound actr-iib and actr-ii is highly similar, exhibiting an r.m.s. deviation for the cα-atoms of  <dig>  Å . the backbone as well as the sidechain conformation of residues in the β2β <dig> loop  of actr-iib and actr-ii, which is possibly generating ligand specificity, are almost identical in all bmp- <dig> ligand-receptor ternary complexes.

the type ii receptor binding site of bmp- <dig> exhibits a convex shape with no deep pockets and is predominantly hydrophobic . the hydrophobic amino acids are in the center and surrounded by a ring of polar and charged residues. the core interface residue of actr-iib, i.e. trp <dig>  tyr <dig> leu <dig>  lys <dig>  v <dig>  and val <dig>  exhibit large accessible surface areas in the unbound state, which become buried by  <dig> to 100% upon complex formation . the knuckle epitope of bmp- <dig> has a complementary hydrophobic surface with a horseshoe-like form . the shape results from the central ser <dig>  which is embedded, in the hydrophobic patch together with the peripheral polar side chain of asn <dig> 

in the complex trp <dig> of actr-iib extends into a shallow pocket formed by ala <dig>  pro <dig>  ser <dig>  leu <dig> and leu <dig> of bmp- <dig> , all of which were identified as important determinants for type ii receptor binding before  <cit> . the hydrophobic area around trp <dig> measures  <dig> by  <dig> Å and is devoid of any water molecules. to test the hypothesis that the majority of the binding free energy originates from hydrophobic interactions, we have used isothermal titration calorimetry. the enthalpy Δh, which is a measure for polar interactions, is rather small for the bmp-2:actr-iibecd interaction , suggesting that polar interactions play a minor role for the binding affinity of bmp- <dig> to type ii receptors. in comparison, the enthalpy for the interaction of bmp- <dig> and bmpr-iaecd is more than twice as large . another indication is in the temperature dependency of the enthalpy, the heat capacity change Δcp which should have a negative value for interactions driven by the burial of hydrophobic interfaces  <cit> . as a matter of fact a rather large negative value of - <dig> cal mol- <dig> k- <dig> was determined for the Δcp  of the bmp-2:actr-iibecd interaction being consistent with the hypothesis that hydrophobic forces drive the binding of the type ii receptors to bmp- <dig> 

analysis of the contact between actr-iibecd and wildtype bmp- <dig> indeed yields only five intermolecular polar bonds, one ion pair and four h-bonds . it is interesting to note that in the ternary complex of bmp- <dig> bound to bmpr-ia and actr-ii just two h-bonds, between bmp- <dig> ser <dig> oγ and actr-ii leu <dig> nh and between bmp- <dig> glu <dig> oε <dig> and actr-ii lys <dig> nζ, are observed  <cit> . this observation suggests that for low-affinity binding polar bonds contribute only marginal to the overall binding energy. the h-bond between bmp- <dig> ser <dig> oγ and actr-iib leu <dig> nh is in the center of the otherwise hydrophobic epitope, whereas the other polar bonds reside at the periphery. as noted before  <cit> , the contact residues involved in the type ii receptor interactions are very similar among bmps and activins. the horseshoe-like hydrophobic core of the knuckle epitope of bmp- <dig>  bmp- <dig> and act-a contains identical or isofunctional residues at equivalent positions . remarkably, the polar ser <dig> at the center of the epitope is highly conserved. pronounced differences exist at the periphery of the epitope . in particular, the residues at the polar opening of the hydrophobic core and juxtaposed to conserved ser <dig> vary among the bmps and act-a .

a comparison of the receptors actr-iib and actr-ii shows that the same amino acid types form the hydrophobic core around trp <dig>  with 56% of the hydrophobic interface residues being identical. most significantly, the central h-bond between receptor leu <dig>  and ligand ser <dig>  seems to be formed in all bmp/activin receptor complexes analyzed so far  <cit> , irrespective whether actr-iib or actr-ii is present . the structural data indicate that activin type ii receptor binding at the knuckle epitope is astonishingly similar in the bmps and activins. thus, the few side chains that differ in the ligand proteins must generate the differences observed in the relative binding affinities of the various receptor-ligand pairs.

a hydrophobic hot spot dominates the promiscuous ligand-type ii receptor interaction
in order to define the binding determinants of actr-iib for the bmps and act-a an alanine scanning analysis was performed. interaction analysis by plasmon resonance spectroscopy employing immobilized ligands confirmed that actr-iibecd binds act-a with high affinity, whereas binding to bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> had a  <dig> to 100-fold lower affinity . in the setup used in this study the apparent kd values were higher by at least two orders of magnitude than those previously determined for actr-ii/iib using the same technique but with immobilized receptors  <cit>  or radioligand binding to receptors in whole cells  <cit> . a possible explanation is due to the fact that two immobilized receptors may bind together to a single dimeric ligand thereby increasing the apparent affinity by avidity effects. this avidity effect has been quantified in the bmp system in part previously and seems to be highly dependent on the setup conditions  <cit> . an immobilized ligand, however, binds two single receptor ectodomains independently thereby resulting in the lower affinity of a 1: <dig> interaction  <cit> , but due to the absence of any avidity effects yields more comparable data. nevertheless the term apparent kd was used throughout since the absolute values of the kd still depend on the evaluation routine, immobilization level, and also on the method used for immobilization. this might explain the higher values reported for the affinities of the act-a:actr-ii  <cit>  and act-a:actr-iib  <cit>  interaction reported previously. when the low-affinity binding to bmp- <dig> is analyzed, the by far most disruptive mutation exists in the actr-iib variant w60a . a considerable loss of affinity is also observed for the variant y42a. substitution of other hydrophobic residues by alanine yielded variants with a less than 10-fold loss in binding affinity for bmp- <dig>  substitutions at the polar residues all have no  or only a minor impact  on binding affinity for bmp- <dig>  therefore the functional binding epitope of actr-iib for bmp- <dig> seems to be dominated by trp <dig> and to a lesser extent by tyr <dig>  which together form the hydrophobic core of the epitope. the surrounding hydrophobic side chains seem to be binding determinants of secondary importance. four of the polar side chains  forming ion pairs or h-bonds with bmp- <dig>  could be removed without major effect on affinity. remarkably, a l61p variant has the same affinity for bmp- <dig> as l61a, even though the central hydrogen bond involving the amide of l <dig> is blocked by the proline substitution . therefore, the conserved central h-bond is also non-functional  in the low-affinity bmp-2:actr-iib interaction. together these data indicate that binding free energy of low-affinity bmp-2:actr-iib interaction is derived almost exclusively from hydrophobic interactions.

a) for these measurements glycosylated bmp- <dig> expressed in cho cells was used.

b) binding is below detection limit 

c) this variant might be not native and exhibits an altered electrophoretical mobility in sds-page under non-reducing conditions.

from the functional data the binding mechanism of actr-iib to bmp- <dig> or bmp- <dig> seems comparable . the main binding determinant for bmp- <dig> is also trp <dig> followed by tyr <dig>  several variants show a similar loss in affinity for bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig>  small differences exist for the variants r46a and l61p. a significant difference is in the interaction of both bmps with lys <dig> of actr-iib. the actr-iib variant k37a binds with increased affinity to bmp- <dig>  whereas the affinity of k37a for bmp- <dig> drops. modeling studies suggested that lys <dig> of actr-iib might be one of the key residues for generating ligand specificity among different bmp members  <cit> . these results obtained for bmp- <dig> support the hypothesis that the low-affinity binding to bmps is determined by a hydrophobic actr-iib binding epitope employing virtually the same hydrophobic binding determinants.

the functional epitope of actr-iib for high-affinity interaction with act-a uses the same hydrophobic main binding determinant as for binding of the bmps. as compiled in table  <dig>  trp <dig> and tyr <dig> are also crucial for binding of act-a. the minor hydrophobic and polar determinants are of comparable importance for binding to bmps and act-a. tyr <dig> and leu <dig> seem to contribute somewhat more to act-a than to bmp binding, whereas lys <dig> and arg <dig> play a likewise lesser role in act-a binding. these small differences might contribute to ligand discrimination to some extent. however, it is probably safe to conclude that an increment in binding free energy corresponding to a low-affinity interaction is the same in binding of bmps and act-a, and likely the determinants for this low-affinity interaction are the same for these ligands. but in addition a further hot spot of binding is present.

a clear and probably crucial distinction of the functional act-a binding epitope is the importance of the leu <dig> amide group as revealed by comparison of the l61a and l61p variants . the removal of the amide proton by the proline substitution leads to a 100-fold higher decrease in binding affinity  than the loss of the leu <dig> side chain in the l61a variant . as mentioned above bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> binding affinity is similar for both variants. this finding strongly suggests that the central conserved hydrogen bond, which is inactive/silent in bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> interaction, is active in the interaction with act-a . this "switchable" h-bond seems to be responsible for the high-affinity binding of act-a.

in conclusion, the determinant for the high-affinity binding of act-a seems to reside in the h-bond provided by the leu <dig> amide proton , whereas this central h-bond interaction does not play an important role for low-affinity interactions with the ligands bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> 

a switch in bmp- <dig> for low- and high-affinity binding of actr-iib
to investigate the mechanism of the ligand-specific properties of this central h-bond in more detail, residues in the bmp- <dig> knuckle epitope were subjected to mutational analysis . the conserved ser <dig> , the h-bond acceptor, is surrounded by residues differing between bmp- <dig>  bmp- <dig> and act-a . we therefore performed a partial "domain swapping" by exchanging residues of bmp- <dig> at the positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for those of act-a . bmp- <dig> ser <dig> and ala <dig> are not critical for actr-iib binding as seen by the kd values of the respective single and double mutants. the effect of the bmp- <dig> mutation s85r on the binding to actr-ii has been analyzed previously  <cit> . the authors report an increase in binding affinity, i.e. 2-fold. the differences in the binding affinities might be due to the different experimental setup.

a) bmp- <dig> variants were expressed in e. coli. note, that the wildtype bmp- <dig> expressed in e. coli has a higher affinity to actr-iib than the glycosylated bmp- <dig> produced in cho cells 

b) the relative binding constant  of bmp- <dig> and act-a are given for comparison.

the side chains at positions  <dig> and  <dig> exert a decisive role in affinity determination. bmp- <dig> variants containing the substitution l100k show a six to 20-fold increase in binding affinity for actr-iib. the bmp- <dig> double variant l100k/n102d binds to actr-iib with an affinity  almost as high as for the interaction of act-a with actr-iib  . the single mutation n102d in bmp- <dig> is deleterious but in combination with the exchange l <dig> k the affinity for actr-iib is further increased. the exchange of these two residues of bmp- <dig> therefore converts the low- into a high-affinity binding epitope and the lysine side chain seems to be the key determinant for this transformation.

a previous mutational analysis of act-a has shown that a positively charged residue at position  <dig>  is required for activin receptor binding  <cit> . this indicates that this lysine is also essential for high-affinity binding of act-a. from structure-/function analyses of the act-a:actr-iib interaction it has been proposed that an intermolecular h-bond between the lys amine group and the backbone carbonyl of cys <dig> of actr-iib contributes to high-affinity binding   <cit> , although the geometrical parameters of this h-bond are close to the exclusion criteria . a similar mechanism has been also proposed from the structure analysis of bmp- <dig> bound to bmpr-ia and actr-ii  <cit> . a comparison of the binding affinities of actr-iib variants to act-a and bmp- <dig> already suggested that the main difference is, however, in the strength of the central conserved h-bond between ser <dig> oγ  and leu <dig> amide . confirming this, our structure of the ternary complex  comprising bmp-2l100k/n102d shows no additional intermolecular h-bond between the lysine side chain and cys <dig> of actr-iib .

instead a double mutant cycle  now reveals that the strength of the h-bond between ser <dig> oγ  and leu <dig> amide  can be modulated through the presence of a lys and an asp residue at position  <dig> and  <dig>  disruption of the central conserved h-bond, i.e. by the actr-iib variant l61p, in the environment of lys <dig> and asp <dig> leads to a drastic reduction in binding affinity to bmp- <dig> similar to that observed for the interaction act-a:actr-iibl61p. comparing the affinities of the actr-iib variants l61p and l61a to wildtype bmp- <dig> shows no difference, indicating that, by contrast, in the wildtype environment the central h-bond does not contribute to the binding free energy .

a) bmp- <dig> variants were expressed in e. coli.

b) the apparent binding constant of act-a is shown for comparison.

the residues lys <dig> and asp <dig> are located directly above the intermolecular h-bond between bmp- <dig> ser <dig> oγ and actr-iib leu <dig> amide at the opening of the horseshoe-like hydrophobic core of the epitope . in the structures of the act-a:actr-iibecd  <cit>  and the ternary complex  of bmp-2l100k/n102d the lys and asp residues form a stable intramolecular salt bridge . accordingly, lys <dig> and asp <dig>  exhibit low temperature factors indicating that both residues are quite immobile. in the structure of the ternary complex  comprising wildtype bmp- <dig> the temperature factors of the equivalent residues leu <dig> and asn <dig> are higher than for nearby residues indicating increased flexibility. the "rigid lid" centered above the conserved h-bond between bmp- <dig> ser <dig> oγ and actr-iib leu <dig> amide might provide an effective shielding from solvent access thereby enhancing the strength of this particular h-bond . by thus modulating the energy contribution of an existing interaction  rather than adding a new  one achieves the switch from low- to high-affinity.

specificity in the bmp- <dig> type ii receptor epitope
individual and combined mutations at bmp- <dig> position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> influence binding of unalike type ii receptors  suggesting that these residues determine binding specificity of bmp- <dig> for actr-ii, actr-iib and bmpr-ii. the exchange of leu <dig> of bmp- <dig> to lysine specifically increases the binding affinity for actr-iib, whereas binding to actr-ii and bmpr-ii is basically unaffected. the double variant l100k/n102d shows a large increase in affinity for actr-iib, in addition the affinity for actr-ii is moderately increased , but binding to bmpr-ii remains unaltered. mutating residues ala <dig> and in particular ser <dig> in bmp- <dig> results in variants that exhibit an increased binding affinity exclusively for bmpr-ii whereas binding to the activin type ii receptors is either unaffected or even decreased. the specific effects of these mutations indicate that the bmp- <dig> knuckle epitope comprises single residues specifying relative affinities and therefore specificity for the interaction with type ii receptors actr-iib, actr-ii and bmpr-ii .

in order to understand if the change in type ii receptor specificity of these bmp- <dig> variants is reflected in their biological activity, the variants were tested for their capabilities to induce alkaline phosphatase  expression in the myoblast cell line c2c <dig> . the c2c <dig> cells express the type ii receptors actr-ii and bmpr-ii but not actr-iib  <cit> . the two bmp- <dig> variants s85r/a86p and l100k/n102d have a three to four-fold lower ec <dig> value than wildtype bmp- <dig> corresponding to a higher biological activity . these results seem to reflect the three to five-fold higher affinity of the double mutants for the actr-ii, respectively the bmpr-ii receptor. in contrast, when the single mutant l100k is analyzed in parallel with wildtype bmp- <dig> the ec <dig> is the same . this might be expected since the bmp- <dig> variant l100k has an unaltered affinity for actr-ii and bmpr-ii and the specifically increased affinity of l100k for actr-iib is biologically not relevant in this specific cell type. in summary, these data strongly suggest that the specific alterations in the mutant bmp- <dig> can be biologically relevant.

actr-iib is one of three type ii receptors known to interact with bmp- <dig>  <cit> . the ectodomains of all three type ii receptors bind with low affinity to this ligand . bmpr-ii has the lowest affinity although in many cells it is the prototypic type ii receptor for bmp- <dig>  the affinity of actr-iib, the strongest bmp- <dig> binder, is about 10-fold higher. in how far these differences in low-affinity type ii binding are important for bmp- <dig> signaling is unknown. the increase in the biological activities observed for bmp- <dig> variants in our study suggests that such small differences might be of functional relevance.

as shown by cross-linking experiments in whole cells, low-affinity type ii receptors alone do not bind or bind only weakly to solute bmp- <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand bmpr-ia, the high-affinity receptor of bmp- <dig>  is efficiently cross-linked when present alone, and in its presence cross-linking of the type ii receptor proceeds efficiently  <cit> . the bmpr-ia ectodomain binds bmp- <dig> in our experimental setup with a dissociation constant of  <dig> to  <dig> nm. this affinity is  <dig> to 200-fold higher than that of the type ii chains. on the basis of this large difference in the relative affinities of the type i and type ii receptors a 2-step assembly mode of the ternary complex can be postulated, where solute bmp- <dig> binds first to the high-affinity bmpr-ia receptor and subsequently in the membrane the binary bmp-2/type i receptor complex can associate with the type ii receptor  <cit> .

the affinity profile of act-a for the type ii ectodomains is completely different from bmp- <dig>  in the present experiments the apparent kd of act-a for actr-iib is about  <dig> nm , typical for a high-affinity interaction. in contrast bmpr-iiecd is bound by act-a with low affinity  resembling the interaction with bmp- <dig>  the type i activin receptor actr-ib by itself has an exceedingly low affinity for act-a  <cit> . chemical cross-linking in the membrane is therefore only possible in the presence of the high-affinity actr-ii/b receptors  <cit> . consequently, the assembly of the ternary activin receptor complex differs in crucial aspects from that of the bmp- <dig> receptor. solute act-a binds first to its high-affinity actr-ii/b receptors before the low-affinity actr-ib receptor is recruited into the complex in the membrane  <cit> . as a consequence the type ii activin receptors play different roles and are involved in different assembly modes during bmp- <dig> versus activin receptor activation. in this context bmpr-ii is a special case. it likely cannot signal with act-a, since it has only a low affinity for this ligand and a high-affinity type i chain is unknown. this generally low affinity of bmpr-ii for bmps and activin possibly explains why cytoplasmatically truncated bmpr-ii exerts a dominant negative effect on bmp but not on activin signaling  <cit> . the truncated bmpr-ii can compete with the low-affinity interaction of type ii receptors and bmp- <dig> but not with the high-affinity interaction of actr-ii/b and activin.

the ectodomains of the actr-ii and actr-iib share 44% sequence identity . the affinities of bmp- <dig> for the two isoforms are similar . it is therefore interesting to compare the interface of bmp- <dig> for actr-iib  and actr-ii  <cit> . the hydrophobic core around trp <dig>  is remarkably conserved. only residues tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> are replaced by phenylalanine residues in actr-ii, however since both tyrosine residues are no involved in h-bonds the replacement should be without affect for the binding affinity. polar bonds at the periphery of the epitopes are different supporting the conclusion already drawn from the mutational analysis of actr-iib that they are not important for binding affinity. only the central h-bond connecting bmp- <dig> ser <dig> oγ and leu <dig> amide also exists in the complex with actr-ii. since a bmp- <dig> s88a variant exhibits only a small decrease in binding affinity for actr-ii  <cit>  it can be assumed that this h-bond is silent or very weak as in the complex of bmp- <dig> with actr-iib. in this context it is intriguing that the bmp- <dig> variants l100k and l100k/n102d have in comparison to actr-iib only a small effect on binding affinity for actr-ii. in particular the double variant l100k/n102d conferring high-affinity binding to actr-iib has a six-fold lower effect on actr-ii binding, while the single variant l100k shows no increase in affinity for actr-ii at all . the kd value for the interaction between actr-ii and bmp- <dig> l100k has been reported before  <cit>  to be five to eight-fold lower than for wildtype bmp- <dig>  the reason for the discrepancy to the present results is as yet unclear. bmp- <dig> l100k/n102d has not been structurally analyzed in complex with actr-ii so far. possibly, the intramolecular hydrophobic lid formed by lys-asp pair is less efficient in complex with actr-ii. considering the identical side chain composition at the core of the receptor epitopes it would be surprising, however, if here an intermolecular h-bond between lys <dig> of the bmp- <dig> variant and the backbone carbonyl of actr-ii cys <dig>  which is not observed in the complex with actr-iib, would contribute to binding affinity  <cit> .

previously, bmp- <dig> mutants have been generated, which function as bmp antagonists either due to disruption of the knuckle epitope  <cit>  or as noggin-blocker due to inactivation of the wrist epitope  <cit> . now new bmp- <dig> variants could be obtained with increased biological activity resulting from improved binding to actr-ii  or bmpr-ii  . it will be interesting to study if the "superagonist" activity of these mutant proteins will be retained in vivo, e.g. in an ectopic bone formation assay or during healing of a critical size bone defect. bmp- <dig> l100k/n102d may also function as an actr-iib blocker, even though its affinity for this receptor is still not as high as that of act-a  or of gdf-8/- <dig> . however, it is unclear whether bmp- <dig> variants can interact with the type i receptor actr-ib to some extent when strongly bound to actr-iib. the results of the present structure/function analysis of actr-iib might give some clues how relative affinity/specificity to certain ligands can be mutationally altered and manipulated. this might become useful for the design of receptor ectodomain constructs, which can specifically inhibit certain bmps, gdfs, activins, or other ligands of the tgf-β superfamily.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present a detailed structure-function analysis of the interaction of bmp- <dig> – a prototypic ligand of the tgf-β superfamily – with its type ii receptor actr-iib. in previous work the determinants for specificity and affinity in type i bmpr-ia and bmpr-ib receptor interaction have been analyzed  <cit> . now new crystal structures of ternary complexes comprising bmpr-ia and actr-iib ectodomains and either wildtype bmp- <dig> or a bmp- <dig> variant with enhanced affinity for actr-iib have been elucidated at high resolution. on the basis of the structural information a mutational analysis of actr-iib and the interacting bmp- <dig> knuckle epitope has been performed in order to investigate possible interactions between epitopes as well as determinants for specificity and affinity in type ii receptor interaction, in particular with the dual-specificity receptor actr-iib. the results reveal a molecular basis for understanding differences in bmp- <dig>  bmp- <dig> and act-a signaling. in addition the molecular mechanisms for high- and low-affinity binding to the actr-iib receptor have been clarified. the present results will possibly help to design ligand and receptor mutant proteins that can be used to target diseases caused by dysregulation of bmp or activin signaling.
