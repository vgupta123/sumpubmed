BACKGROUND
chemical carcinogens that act by a genotoxic mechanism exert their biological effects through damaging dna. this damage can be manifested in several forms, including single or double strand breaks, apurinic sites and covalent modification of the bases. some chemical carcinogens such as benzopyrene , which is a representative of the class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , are thought to cause cancer through covalent binding of their reactive metabolites to dna, forming dna adducts  <cit> . bap- <dig> -diol- <dig> -epoxides , the ultimate carcinogenic metabolites of bap, react predominantly with the n <dig> position of guanine residues and to a lesser extent with the n <dig> position of adenine residues in dna  <cit> .

in mammalian cells bap binds to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor , which is a cytosolic ligand-activated transcription factor that functions as a sensor of extracellular signals and environmental stresses affecting cell growth and development. ahr controls the expression of genes coding for xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes such as cytochrome p450s , udp-glucuronosyltransferase ugt1a <dig>  nadh:quinone oxidoreductase- <dig> , aldehyde dehydrogenase , and several glutathione-s-transferases  <cit> . it is also involved in regulation of development and in the control of circadian rhythms, neurogenesis and stress response to hypoxia  <cit> .

more recently it has also become evident that ahr has another function, namely in controlling cell cycle progression. for instance, high-affinity ahr ligands, such as some pahs, cause a wide range of cell-cycle perturbations, including g0/g <dig> arrest or its evasion   <cit> , g2/m arrest, s-phase accumulation, diminished capacity for dna replication and inhibition of cell proliferation  <cit> . these perturbations have been documented in several gene expression profiling studies. previously we have used microarray technology to analyse the transcriptomes of several human cell lines exposed to bap  <cit> . altered expression of a number of genes involved in cell cycle regulation were identified, including cdkn1a, mak, btg <dig>  ccng <dig> and e2f <dig>  other studies have shown that up-regulated ahr-dependent activation of cyp1a <dig> following bap exposure may be dependent on the cell-cycle phase  <cit> , suggesting that the phase of the cell cycle may be critical to some of the effects of bap on human cells.

in this study, we investigated whether cells are more susceptible to a genotoxic carcinogen, namely bap, at particular phases of the cell cycle and, if so, to elucidate the processes involved. dna microarrays were used to examine changes in gene expression throughout the cell cycle in synchronised human breast carcinoma mcf- <dig> cells following exposure to non-cytotoxic concentrations of bap. cell cycle phase-specific changes in gene expression profiles resulting from carcinogen exposure have identified novel genes and pathways potentially involved in the carcinogenic process. to strengthen the process of identifying target genes, gene expression data were compared to other biological parameters, including dna adduct formation, determined by 32p-postlabelling analysis, and cell cycle progression, measured by facs analysis.

RESULTS
cell cycle progression
in initial experiments, the optimum time of treatment with bap was determined to be  <dig> h. this gave sufficient time for cells to metabolise bap to dna-binding reactive intermediates, but minimised the extent to which untreated synchronised cells altered their cell-cycle phase composition. in the case of g0/g <dig> enrichment, cells will start exiting the quiescent state  and entering g <dig> soon after adding the serum back to the medium. thus, from now on, these cells are referred to as g1-enriched. in previous work, the treatment concentration of  <dig>  μm was found to induce dna adduct formation in mcf- <dig> cells within a linear dose-response range  <cit> .

g1-enriched cultures  did not differ significantly in the proportions of cells in different phases after treatment for  <dig> h with bap compared with dmso-treated controls . cells were progressing through the cell cycle and started entering s and g2/m phases by the end of the treatment. we did not observe a g <dig> arrest after bap treatment.

exposure of s-enriched cultures  to bap evoked dramatic alterations in cell cycle distribution with an increase of the fraction of cells in s-phase . the percentage of cells in g2/m-phase was significantly lower than in control cultures .

similarly, bap treatment of g2/m-enriched cultures  increased the proportion of cells in s-phase .

dna damage in synchronised mcf- <dig> cells
bap-dna adduct formation was determined by the 32p-postlabelling method. cells enriched in g <dig>  s and g2/m that were exposed to bap for  <dig> h showed different levels of dna adducts . levels of adducts in the s- and g2/m-enriched cultures were  <dig> to 4-fold higher than levels observed in g1-enriched cultures.

when cells were treated with bpde for  <dig> h, the reactive metabolite of bap, similar levels of dna adducts were formed in all cultures regardless of cell-cycle phase . since bpde does not require metabolic activation to bind to dna, and has a short half-life in aqueous environments, this result suggests that the differences observed with bap are the consequence of different capacities to metabolically activate bap at different stages of the cell cycle.

bap-induced gene expression changes by microarray analysis
cdna microarray analysis was carried out on synchronised cultures of mcf- <dig> cells enriched in g <dig>  s and g2/m phases and exposed to  <dig>  μm bap for  <dig> h.

condition clustering and principal component analysis  revealed that exposure to bap resulted in expression profiles more distinguishable by cell-cycle phase than by treatment .

differentially expressed genes in each enriched culture were identified using student's t-test and a cut-off of  <dig> -fold change in expression. this resulted in  <dig> genes in g1-,  <dig> genes in s-, and  <dig> genes in g2/m-enriched cultures .  <dig> genes were shared between all phases ,  <dig> between g <dig> and s only ,  <dig> between g <dig> and g2/m only , and  <dig> between s and g2/m only . however, the majority of modulated genes were cell-cycle specific .

functional annotations of bap-modulated genes
in order to find biological processes significantly over-represented in the gene lists generated by statistical analysis, overlay of gene ontology information was carried out using the gene ontology  function within genespring. biological themes that occurred in response to bap through the cell cycle were thereby identified. the majority of functions identified indicate that the transcriptional response to bap in mcf- <dig> cells in different phases is complex, with a large number of biochemical and molecular pathways being affected .

genes over-represented had an expression change of at least  <dig> -fold.

in g <dig>  genes involved in macromolecule metabolism were over-represented by four functional groups: macromolecule biosynthesis , positive regulation of metabolism  and transcription , and amino acid transport . these genes are involved in rna transcription and protein synthesis and code for several ribosomal proteins , solute carriers , and regulators of transcription . other modulated genes belonged to cell differentiation  and cell proliferation  functional groups.

in s-phase, cell proliferation functional groups  were again identified including the genes btg <dig>  btg <dig>  gas <dig> and hdac <dig>  of these, btg <dig> and btg <dig>  belong to a family of anti-proliferative genes. genes involved in pah metabolism were also over-represented and these included cyp1b <dig>  akr1c <dig>  aldh1a <dig> and ugt1a <dig> 

in g2/m-phase, the largest functional groups identified were regulation of nucleic acid metabolism  and regulation of transcription , followed by cell differentiation  and cell cycle . cell cycle regulation genes induced by bap included npm <dig>  nbn, fhit, cables <dig>  atf <dig>  pcaf, ccng <dig>  rgc <dig>  sesn <dig> and bax. signal transduction genes were represented by several functional groups such as small gtpase-mediated signal transduction , mapkkk cascade  and stress-related protein kinase signalling pathway .

pathway analysis of bap-modulated genes
the generated gene lists from genespring were submitted to ingenuity pathway analysis  and several interesting pathways and genes were revealed. seven selected networks are presented here ; they are the top two scoring networks in each enriched culture and a third one for g2/m-enriched cultures. this selection was based on the ranking score within ipa, where networks with the highest number of significant changes rank highest in the list . several biological processes and signalling pathways were shown to be at the centre of bap-modulation, as described below.

g1-phase 
network 5a relates to the catenin/wnt pathway, which has a crucial role in embryonic development. its deregulation can induce disease, most importantly cancer. one important gene in this pathway is ctnnb <dig>  which stabilises β-catenin, a cytoplasmic protein that translocates into the nucleus and activates downstream genes such as myc and cyclin d <dig>  both of which regulate cell proliferation  <cit> .

network 5b involves mainly the jun, egr <dig> and erk pathway. jun, which is up-regulated in both g1- and s-phases, is an oncogene and a transcription factor that plays a role in the regulation of normal cell cycle progression  <cit> . egr <dig> is another transcription factor that was up-regulated at the mrna level in our study. it is at the crossroads of many signalling cascades. many functions have been attributed to this protein, in particular its involvement in the control of cell growth, survival and transformation  <cit> .

s-phase 
jun is again the focus of network 6a and it is linked to several other genes, for example gdf <dig> and atf <dig>  both of which were up-regulated in the present study.

atf <dig> is a member of the atf/cyclic amp response element-binding family of transcription factors. it has been proposed that it has a dichotomous role in cancer development by promoting or suppressing apoptosis and proliferation  <cit> . gdf <dig> is a member of the transforming growth factor b  superfamily that regulates tissue differentiation and maintenance. it is also a transcriptional target of p <dig>  <cit> . another interesting gene shown in this network is nfκb, which promotes cell survival.

network 6b shows mainly molecules that are involved in oxidative stress; nfe2l <dig>  is induced in response to reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. nrf <dig> plays a major role in the protective mechanism against xenobiotics capable of damaging dna and initiating carcinogenesis. it is a cellular sensor of chemical- and radiation-induced oxidative and electrophilic stress, and a nuclear transcription factor that controls the expression and coordinated induction of a battery of defensive genes encoding detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant proteins. one of these proteins is nqo <dig>  <cit> , which is mentioned in the introduction.

g2/m-phase 
network 7a involves two pathways, akt and apoptosis. akt is a serine/threonine protein kinase that, when activated, plays a key role in mediating signals for cell growth, cell survival , cell-cycle progression, differentiation, transcription, translation, and glucose metabolism. recent advances in studying akt signalling have uncovered important roles in g2/m transition of the cell cycle where akt activity is highest  <cit> . the nrf <dig> pathway is again central to network 7b, which shows several genes involved in oxidative stress mechanisms such as nfe2l <dig>  gstm <dig>  slc7a <dig>  and ahrr.

network 7c was selected to be shown here because it has the important tumour suppressor tp <dig> at its centre along with several of its targets, confirming results obtained by gene ontology analysis. aspm participates in the normal mitotic spindle function while mbnl <dig> belongs to the muscleblind family that regulates alternative splicing. cables <dig> is a pro-apoptotic factor involved in p53-dependent or p53-independent apoptosis  <cit>  while scaper is a cyclin a-interacting protein that regulates cell cycle progression at the g/s and g2/m checkpoints  <cit> .

bap-induced gene expression changes by rt-pcr
rt-pcr is a more sensitive and specific measure of gene expression and was used to validate a number of key expression changes and to determine the reliability of the microarrays. genes were selected for rt-pcr validation on the basis of: a) genespring statistical analysis, b) gene ontology analysis and c) pathway analysis.

genes validated by rt-pcr are shown in table  <dig>  in the majority of cases there was a good correlation between rt-pcr and microarray results, rt-pcr being more sensitive; expression ratios were generally underestimated by microarray analysis. for cyp1a <dig>  the correlation between the two methods was very low; no clear change in this transcript was evident from the microarrays, whereas rt-pcr identified strong induction in all phases ranging from 74-fold in g2/m-enriched cultures to over 1800-fold in s-enriched cultures . the failure of the microarrays to identify this gene expression change may be a result of very low basal levels of this transcript in this cell line, such that even if strongly induced, the microarrays are not sensitive enough to detect it. another explanation could be the quality and specificity of the probe sequence in the array.

a  <dig> -fold cut-off was used. ↑ denotes up-regulation, and ↓ denotes down-regulation.

protein expression
there was a clear induction of both cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig> proteins after bap exposure in all phases, but to a greater extent in s- and g2/m- than in g1-enriched cultures . band quantification showed that there was a  <dig> -fold higher level of cyp1b <dig> in s- and g2/m- than in g1-enriched cultures after bap treatment. similarly, the amount of cyp1a <dig> protein after bap exposure was  <dig> to 6-fold higher in s- and g2/m- than in g1-enriched cultures. these findings correlate strongly with levels of dna adducts seen in the different phases. there was a down-regulation of ahr after bap treatment, as the protein levels were lower by 2-fold in bap-treated compared to dmso control cells in all enriched cultures.

a number of tp53-regulated genes were modulated in response to bap exposure at: a) the microarray level: stmn <dig> in g <dig> only; gdf <dig> and btg <dig> in s only; pcaf, bax, sesn <dig>  aspm, mbnl <dig>  cables <dig> and scaper in g2/m only; c-jun and btg <dig> in g <dig> and s; hint <dig> and rgc <dig> in g <dig> and g2/m; b) the rt-pcr level: cdkn1a, gdf <dig>  and rgc <dig> in all phases. other genes that regulate tp <dig> activity, such as mdm <dig> and npm <dig>  were also modulated by bap.

however, as expected, induction of tp <dig> gene expression was not observed on the microarrays and this was confirmed by rt-pcr. therefore, p <dig> protein levels were assessed by western blotting in order to confirm accumulation of this tumour suppressor in response to the bap in different phases of the cell cycle . an increase in p <dig> protein was observed in mcf- <dig> cells after exposure to bap in all phases with considerably more protein in g2/m-enriched cultures, underlying its significant role in the g2/m checkpoint. these profiles of p <dig> protein activation are similar to those of its direct target cdkn1a , except that there was no induction in s-enriched cultures .

discussion
microarray technology is a powerful tool for identifying gene expression patterns that are reflective of the response of cells to carcinogen exposure  <cit> , and can be informative of mechanisms of action  <cit> . using this technology we have investigated whether human cells are more susceptible to the environmental carcinogen bap at particular phases of the cell cycle and, if so, to elucidate the mechanisms involved. the resulting gene expression profiles were related to other phenotypic measures of bap exposure such as dna damage and cell cycle distribution to further our biological understanding of bap carcinogenesis.

we found that bap induced more dna damage in synchronised mcf- <dig> cells enriched in s- and g2/m-phases than in g <dig>  which indicates that bap is metabolised with varying efficiency at different stages of the cell cycle. this conclusion is supported by the fact that dna damage induced by bpde -which modifies dna without further metabolism-, was not cell cycle dependent. gene expression profiling data  and protein expression of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes further supported this hypothesis. indeed, cyp1a <dig> mrna measured by rt-pcr was almost 20-fold higher in s-phase than in g <dig> and g2/m. cyp1b <dig> mrna followed the same pattern with a 2-fold higher induction in s-phase. moreover, comparison between the levels of cyp1a <dig> in different phases revealed more mrna in s- and g2/m-enriched cultures. the same pattern was observed at the protein level for cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig>  these findings correlate well with the levels of bap-dna adducts at each phase of the cell cycle, consistent with the role of cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig> in the metabolic activation of bap to bpde.

previously, jiao et al.  <cit>  reported an up-regulation of cyp1a <dig> mrna of > 100-fold in bap-treated s-enriched mcf- <dig> cultures, while up-regulation in g1- and g2/m-enriched cultures occurred to a significantly lesser extent. consistent with this, they also reported higher levels of dna damage in the form of dna single strand breaks and bap-dna adducts in s-enriched cultures. however, it is not the extent of induction that matters but the actual levels  of mrna and protein, because an apparently very strong induction could be due simply to very low basal levels. moreover, jiao and coworkers' bap treatment was for  <dig> h, a duration that is long enough for the cells to progress to another phase of the cell cycle. in another study, santini et al.  <cit>  showed that within  <dig> h of tcdd exposure late g1/early s-phase u <dig> human leukaemic monocyte lymphoma cells had  <dig> - and 3-fold higher cyp1a <dig> mrna levels than asynchronous/early g <dig> and g2/m cultures, respectively. in contrast, we found that the absolute mrna levels of cyp1a <dig> and the protein levels of both cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig> were actually higher in s- and g2/m-enriched cultures. ahr down-regulation at the protein level in all enriched cultures was the result of suppressing ahr signalling by rapid proteosomal degradation. ligand-dependent receptor activation is well established, and several mechanisms capable of suppressing prolonged ahr signalling have been identified. these include rapid receptor degradation, the action of an ahr repressor protein , and agonist depletion through an enzymatic negative feedback loop  <cit> . ahr activation independent of agonist binding in mammalian systems has been proposed, but evidence for it is not yet conclusive. chang and puga  <cit>  reported that ahr-dependent effects on cell proliferation could be dissociated from exogenous ligand binding. in another study, cell density, but not cell cycle, was shown to influence the intracellular distribution of ahr  <cit> . however, neither study established the absence of an endogenous ligand responsible for receptor activity.

preliminary experiments have indicated that there are no differences in bap-dna adduct formation between g0- and g1-enriched mcf- <dig> cultures . therefore, adduct levels in g0- are lower than s- and g2/m-enriched cultures. g <dig> cells are quiescent i.e. not cycling, as is the case with many cell types in mammalian tissues. interpreting the adduct data in the light of this information could point to a difference in susceptibility to genotoxic carcinogens between proliferating  and non-proliferating cells .

bap exposure resulted in an arrest of the cells in s-phase of the cell cycle in s- and g2/m-enriched cultures, indicating that interruption of dna synthesis had occurred. this is in agreement with other studies that have shown the inhibition of dna synthesis in response to bap  <cit> . the pause in dna synthesis is probably due to the intra-s checkpoint, which allows repair enzymes time to recognize the damaged dna and to correct it, avoiding irreversible errors during replication . alternatively, a permanent growth arrest or apoptosis can be initiated if damage is too great or persists for too long  <cit> .

we found that bap did not activate the g1/s checkpoint despite p <dig> and p <dig> protein induction in these phases. the g <dig> arrest delays dna damaged cells from progressing through the cell cycle, avoiding accumulation of mutations and chromosomal aberrations by means of dna repair or apoptosis. tp <dig> and its transcriptional target cdkn1a  contribute to g <dig> and g <dig> arrest in response to dna damage to maintain genomic stability  <cit> . these responses consist of the atm/chk2-p53/mdm2-p <dig> pathway, which is capable of sustaining g <dig> arrest. phosphorylation of p <dig> transcription factor and mdm <dig>  results in p <dig> stabilisation and accumulation. p <dig>  in turn, inhibits cyclin e/cdk <dig> and preserves the rb/e2f pathway in its active, growth-suppressing mode  <cit> .

in one study, khan and dipple  <cit>  showed that following treatment with a range of agents, including metabolites of bap, g <dig> arrest does not occur in mcf- <dig> cells and other cell lines. they also demonstrated that bpde is not effective in arresting mcf- <dig> cells in g <dig> in spite of inducing dose-dependent increases in p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . the ability of carcinogens to induce cells to evade the g <dig> dna-damage checkpoint and progress into s-phase is known as the stealth property. this property presumably enhances the mutation frequency and increases the likelihood of malignant changes.

in another study, jiao et al.  <cit>  investigated the mechanisms by which bap accelerates cell cycle progression  and induces cell proliferation in human embryo lung fibroblasts. they also found that c-jun activation  by p53-dependent pi-3k/akt/erk pathway might be responsible for bap-induced cell cycle alterations. interestingly, jun mrna was up-regulated by bap in our study in both g1- and s-enriched cultures. in addition to that, our pathway analysis showed it to be significantly involved in network 5b  and network 6a .

gene ontology analysis revealed several over-represented biological themes after bap exposure. these include cell differentiation, cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and xenobiotic metabolism. in g1-enriched cultures, some modulated genes belonged to cell differentiation  and cell proliferation  functional groups. one of these genes is btg <dig> , which has been identified as a dna damage-inducible chk1-modulated gene. as it is a direct p <dig> target this emphasises its importance in cell cycle regulation and in maintaining genome stability  <cit> . another example of modulated genes involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation is egr <dig>  which was also revealed by pathway analysis . modulation of the expression of this gene was validated by rt-pcr and it was shown to be induced in g1-, and s-enriched cultures. several xenobiotic metabolism genes were also modulated by bap, including cyp1b <dig>  gstt <dig> and nqo <dig>  detoxification of pah quinone metabolites is carried out by nadh:quinone oxidoreductase encoded by nqo <dig>  <cit> , which is also required for p <dig> stabilisation in response to dna damage  <cit> . glutathione s-transferase t <dig>  is involved in cellular defence against toxic and carcinogenic electrophilic compounds by conjugation of reduced glutathione to hydrophobic electrophiles  <cit> , so it was a logical finding that gstt <dig> was up-regulated in response to bap exposure.

pathway analysis revealed the activation of the catenin/wnt pathway  in the response to bap exposure. consistent with this, rt-pcr analysis showed that dkk <dig>  was down-regulated  in g1-enriched cultures and ctnnb <dig> was up-regulated  in the same cultures.

in s-phase, cell proliferation and apoptosis genes such as btg <dig> and hdac <dig> were also differentially expressed. previously, our team showed that btg <dig> was up-regulated by bap and bpde at different time points in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . its expression was also shown to be induced by genotoxic stress through a p53-dependent mechanism  <cit> . hdac <dig>  which encodes a histone deacetylase that represses transcription and regulates differentiation, was down-regulated in our experiments  <cit> . differentially expressed genes involved in pah metabolism included cyp1b <dig>  akr1c <dig>  aldh1a <dig> and ugt1a <dig>  cyp1b <dig>  encodes a member of the cyp superfamily of monooxygenases and is involved in the metabolic activation of bap  <cit> . interestingly, enhanced expression of this enzyme has been observed in a number of cancers  <cit>  and it has been demonstrated, in experiments involving cyp1b1-null mice, that it enhances the carcinogenicity of  <dig> -dimethylbenzanthracene  <cit> . cyp1b <dig> has also been found to be up-regulated in primary human mammary epithelial cells exposed to bap, highlighting the importance of this enzyme in bap metabolism in this tissue  <cit> . consistent with previous studies  <cit> , akr1c <dig> was also found to be up-regulated by bap. it encodes an aldo-keto reductase capable of metabolising pah trans-dihydrodiols to o-quinones that can lead to the formation of dna adducts and reactive oxygen species   <cit> , thus providing another pathway of pah genotoxicity. ugt1a <dig> is involved in glucuronidation, which is a major pathway for detoxification of pah metabolites  <cit> .

another interesting gene function category revealed by the transcriptomic analysis was that of dna-damage induced protein phosphorylation, as exemplified by map2k <dig>  this gene encodes a member of the dual specificity protein kinase family, which functions as a mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinase. map kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases , act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals. this protein phosphorylates and activates p <dig> map kinase in response to inflammatory cytokines or environmental stress. as an essential component of the p <dig> map kinase signal transduction pathway, map2k <dig> is involved in many cellular processes such as stress-induced cell cycle arrest, transcription activation and apoptosis  <cit> .

in g2/m-phase, bap altered the expression of several cell cycle regulation genes, including npm <dig>  pcaf, nbn, rgc <dig>  sesn <dig> and bax as shown by gene ontology and pathway analysis . npm <dig>  has been shown to be implicated in human tumourigenesis, functioning both as an oncogene and as a tumour-suppressor. it is involved in many pathways such as cell cycle control, dna repair and apoptotic response to stress by modulating the activity and stability of critical tumour-suppressor proteins such as p <dig>  <cit> . nbn  is involved in cell cycle checkpoints in response to dna damage  <cit> . rgc <dig>  sesn <dig> and bax  are all targets of p <dig> contributing to its role in cell cycle regulation, metabolism and apoptosis  <cit> . indeed, accumulation of p <dig> was seen after bap treatment by western blotting .

CONCLUSIONS
exposure of synchronized mcf- <dig> cells to bap has identified a complex gene expression response by microarray analysis. a number of genes were found to have their expression altered by bap, including those involved in xenobiotic metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and dna repair. gene ontology and pathway analysis showed the involvement of various signalling pathways in the response to bap, such as catenin/wnt pathway in g <dig>  erk pathway in g <dig> and s, nrf <dig> pathway in s and g2/m and akt pathway in g2/m.

a key finding in this study was that higher levels of dna adducts in s- and g2/m-enriched cultures correlated with higher levels of cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig> mrna and protein expression, indicating that proliferating cells are more prone to dna damage by genotoxic stress than non-proliferating cells. our results clearly demonstrate that this is due to the varying efficiency of bap metabolism through the cell cycle. additional studies with other cells lines and genotoxic agents will be required to determine whether our findings, in terms of adduct formation and expression of cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig>  are universal or specific to certain cell types.
