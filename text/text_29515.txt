BACKGROUND
storage mites are global pests of stored food products of increasing medical and economical impact. in agricultural environments, they cause occupational allergy in farmers and grain handlers. storage mites are also found in house dust from rural and urban dwellings and are important contributors to the allergen content, which expands their clinical significance. the storage mites belong to the acaridae and glycyphagidae families; our work focuses on acarus siro, one of the most frequent and abundant species in central europe.

more than two dozen groups of mite-derived allergens have been described in the who/iuis allergen nomenclature database http://www.allergen.org. allergens from house dust mites of dermatophagoides spp. have been extensively studied; however, much less is known about allergens from storage mites  . there is increasing evidence that mites contain epitopes that are species-specific as well as cross-reactive among species. the effect of a partial cross-reactivity between storage mites and house dust mites and co-sensitization by both groups further increases the medical impact of storage mites  <cit> . a detailed analysis of storage mite-derived allergens at the protein level will be necessary to better evaluate aspects of their sensitization specificity and biochemical activity, as well as to improve diagnosis and treatment.

group  <dig> mite allergens are homologous proteins of the α-amylase class  <cit> . group  <dig> allergens have been investigated in house dust mites such as dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, euroglyphus maynei, and blomia tropicalis, and their sequences have been determined  <cit> . the biochemical properties of der p  <dig> were analyzed in detail, including its interaction with major cereal flour allergens that act as α-amylase inhibitors  <cit> . the ige-binding activity of group  <dig> allergens has been demonstrated for ~30% of allergic subjects in western populations and china  <cit> ; these allergens may also be the major contributor to the serum activity, as found in an australian aboriginal community  <cit> . in this work, we analyze native aca s  <dig> from a. siro, the first α-amylase allergen to be isolated from storage mites. specifically, we describe its biochemical and immunological properties. furthermore, we provide insight into the 3d structure of aca s  <dig> with the help of a novel homology model, the first 3d model of a group  <dig> allergen.

RESULTS
quantification of α-amylase activity in a. siro
a high α-amylase activity was demonstrated in the whole body extract from the storage mite a. siro using chromogenic starch as a substrate. figure  <dig> shows that this activity was one order of magnitude higher than that measured for a model house dust mite d. farinae . in both species, a pronounced α-amylase activity was also detected in the faecal extract, suggesting that α-amylases are digestive enzymes secreted into the gut lumen and released in the mite faeces .

for comparison, the proteolytic activity was determined in the whole body extracts, which showed that d. farinae has a higher proteolytic activity than a. siro  and a higher content of cysteine proteases . we conclude that there is an important difference in the distribution of digestive enzymes in these model species of storage and house dust mites, which most likely reflects their feeding ecology. the high level of α-amylase activity in a. siro is in accordance with the feeding preferences of a. siro, a granivorous species evolutionarily adapted to utilization of a starch-rich diet  <cit> .

isolation and proteomic identification of aca s 4
α-amylase was purified to homogeneity from the whole body extract of a. siro using an optimized procedure for affinity precipitation with glycogen. the typical yield was approximately  <dig> μg from  <dig> g of fresh weight of mites. the purified enzymatically active α-amylase migrated as a single band of  <dig> kda on sds-page . we performed a two-pronged proteomic characterization of this protein:  the n-terminal amino acid sequence, xspysnphftgsr , was determined by edman sequencing and  the protein was subjected to enzymatic digestion followed by lc-ms/ms analysis. the data were searched against the uniprot protein database, which revealed identity with the cdna-derived protein sequence of an a. siro α-amylase homolog denoted aca s  <dig> . the ms/ms peptide coverage of this sequence was ~31% . a theoretical mass calculated for the mature aca s  <dig>  is  <dig> da, which is in good agreement with the experimental value obtained for the purified aca s  <dig> .

biochemical functional characterization of aca s 4
the purified aca s  <dig> was characterized with regard to its substrate and inhibitor interactions. the ph profile  shows that the enzyme functions in the slightly acidic to neutral range, with a maximum at ph ~ <dig> , which is in accordance with the ph optimum of α-amylase activity measured with the whole body extract of a. siro  <cit> . a similar ph optimum was also reported for the purified der p  <dig>  <cit> . we tested the modulation of the aca s  <dig> activity by chloride ions, which are general activators of animal α-amylases  <cit> . figure 4b shows the activation of a typical chloride-dependent α-amylase from porcine pancreas and of aca s  <dig> in the presence of nacl. chloride ions induced an increase in the activity of both aca s  <dig> and its porcine homolog; however, aca s  <dig> was activated to a lesser extent. aca s  <dig> was inhibited by acarbose , a microbial oligosaccharide that is a general inhibitor of enzymes of the α-amylase class. this is in line with our previous finding that acarbose exerts an acaricidal activity against a. siro by inhibiting its digestive amylolytic activity  <cit> . interestingly, aca s  <dig> was insensitive to inhibition by two types of proteinaceous inhibitors of plant origin, namely wheat inhibitors wi- <dig> and wi- <dig>  and bean inhibitor αai- <dig>  which are potent inhibitors of various insect and mammalian α-amylases  <cit> . a pronounced inhibitory effect against der p  <dig> has been reported for the tetrameric wheat inhibitor  <cit> . we applied a combinatorial library of synthetic pamis  that was developed to analyze the inhibitory specificity of α-amylases  <cit> . using this tool, we compared the inhibitory specificity of aca s  <dig> and der f  <dig> . figure 4c shows that inhibition profiles of both enzymes follow the same general trend but also have distinct features. this result indicates that the active site regions of mite α-amylases share overall architecture but differ in some structural details. this analysis helps increase understanding of the different affinities of mite α-amylases to natural proteinaceous inhibitors such as the wheat α-amylase inhibitor  <cit> .

three-dimensional model of aca s 4
a structural model of aca s  <dig> was created by homology modeling . the aca s  <dig> structure shows an overall fold and secondary structure elements forming three consensus domains as in the insect and mammalian α-amylases   <cit> . the disulfide pattern is composed of four conserved disulfides and one additional disulfide  located in the b domain ; aca s  <dig> does not contain free-thiol cysteines, as demonstrated experimentally by a thiol labeling experiment . the catalytic center of aca s  <dig> consists of three acidic residues and retains the characteristic α-amylase architecture . we inspected the calcium-binding and chloride-binding sites, which are known to be important for active site function in the animal α-amylases. the structure of the calcium-binding site, which is necessary for the stabilization of the active site, is preserved in the aca s  <dig> model. in contrast, the chloride-binding site of aca s  <dig> was found to be modified in comparison with the structures of other animal α-amylases. the typical chloride-binding residues arg <dig>  asn <dig> and arg <dig>  forming the "rnr signature" are not all conserved, and asn <dig> is replaced by ser in aca s  <dig> . furthermore, a comparison of the aca s  <dig> sequence with those of its homologs available in the sequence database showed that this substitution  is specific for α-amylases of mite origin . the chloride ion serves as an allosteric activator of catalysis of α-amylases  <cit> . the lower sensitivity of aca s  <dig> to chloride activation  is likely due to the substitution of asn with ser in the chloride-binding site. this is supported by a study performed on human pancreatic α-amylase in which the chloride-binding residues were mutated  <cit> ; the substitution at position  <dig> resulted in a defect in catalytic efficiency and chloride binding that resembles the behavior of aca s  <dig>  recently, we have described another evolutionarily acquired mutation  in the chloride-binding site that leads to the chloride-independence of alkaline α-amylases of lepidopteran insects  <cit> .

immunoreactivity of aca s 4
the ige reactivity of aca s  <dig> was tested by immunoblotting using pooled sera from patients allergic to house dust mites . figure  <dig> shows binding of ige to the purified aca s 4; the staining was specific, as it was inhibited when using pooled sera preincubated with aca s  <dig>  the staining pattern of the whole body extract of a. siro demonstrated that aca s  <dig> of ~ <dig> kda is a significant ige-reactive component although it is a protein of low abundance in the a. siro extract. aca s  <dig> is likely recognized by serum ige due to  a cross-reactivity with homologous α-amylase allergens from house dust mites  and/or  a reactivity of anti-aca s  <dig> ige induced by exposure to a. siro . to gain insight into the structural basis of a possible cross-reactivity, we compared aca s  <dig> with der p  <dig>  an α-amylase allergen from d. pteronyssinus with known sequence . both sequences display a 66% amino acid identity. the conserved sequence regions are shown on the surface model of aca s  <dig> ; they form a dense net of clusters representing the potential common ige-binding epitopes.

CONCLUSIONS
our work provides the first comprehensive protein-level analysis of the α-amylase allergen aca s  <dig> from a. siro. the results give new insights into the biochemistry of the group  <dig> allergens of mites and suggest that the interaction of aca s  <dig> with patients' ige may be relevant to allergic hypersensitivity to mites.
