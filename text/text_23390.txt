BACKGROUND
during malignant progression, cells accumulate multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations that cause loss of at least one anti-oncogenic function. such a loss can be caused by a variety of events including mutation and losses that take place at the chromosome level, e.g. loss of heterozygosity , which is a hallmark of numerous cancers  <cit> . many cases of loh are caused by mitotic recombination  between homologous chromosomes  <cit> . loh can also arise via uniparental disomy , a change that presumably begins with nondisjunction of sister chromatids, producing trisomy in a daughter cell. subsequent mis-segregation during mitosis of a trisomic cell can produce a disomic cell where both homologues were derived from the same parental homologue   <cit> . on other occasions, gene conversion  and interstitial deletions cause loh  <cit> . in addition, it has recently come to light that some cells in the brain can be monosomic for one or more chromosomes  <cit> .

tumors serve as indicators of allele loss, but not all allele loss events necessarily lead to a tumor. loh in diverse, nontransformed cell types in the body would be directly detectable if this event were to confer an obvious phenotype  on an individual cell, its sibling, and their progeny. mice that carry two different fluorescent protein genes as alleles of a locus would seem to be a useful tool for addressing this issue because loh would change a cell's phenotype from dichromatic to monochromatic. if tissue architecture permits, the cause of loh would be suggested by the number and arrangement of mutant cells because loh caused by mitotic crossing over produces a pair of neighboring monochromatic cells expressing different colors  <cit> . by contrast, loh caused by other events, such as upd, gene conversion, or point mutation would be expected to produce a single monochromatic cell.

as a first step in assessing the utility of the allelic marker approach in mammals, we derived cell lines from mice that carried two different fluorescent protein  genes as alleles at the widely expressed rosa <dig> locus, which is on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . although our studies were primarily motivated by an interest in loh in mouse tissues, studies on genetic stability and allelic gene expression in mouse es cells are of interest in their own right. the totipotent nature of es cells has made them a useful tool for manipulating the genome and a promising prospect for human therapeutic applications. however, introduction of genetically damaged es cells could lead to adverse outcomes.

the genetic and karyotypic stability of es cells in general is not entirely clear. on one hand, aneuploid mouse es cell lines are fairly common  <cit> . on the other hand, hundreds of mice have been made from es cells, showing that these cells can maintain genetic stability when handled properly  <cit> . some studies have suggested high rates of allele loss in es cells  <cit> , while in others, loss rates were hundreds of fold lower  <cit> . different rates of point mutation have also been reported for es cells  <cit> . the reasons for these different observations are not clear, but could include differences in marker genes employed, methods used to detect variant cells, cell lines studied, rates at which different chromosomes undergo either nondisjunction or mitotic recombination, and inadvertent selection of cells that proliferate better in culture. the bichromatic biallelic es cells described herein differ from others studied because cells with variant phenotypes can be identified and isolated by facs.

RESULTS
fluorescence phenotypes of cells in populations of biallelic embryonic fibroblasts
the two lines of transgenic mice used to make embryonic cell lines were a gift from f. costantini, whose work had shown that both fluorescent proteins were simultaneously widely expressed in mice, which appeared normal  <cit> . three r26cy mouse embryonic fibroblast  populations were independently derived, each from one  <dig>  day post coitus  embryo. these cells were cultured for a few passages and then subjected to facs analysis.

nearly all of the cells in each population exhibited both cfp and yfp fluorescence  . however, cfp signal intensities tended to be lower than yfp intensities, which was expected because cfp is intrinsically less bright  <cit> . a few percent of the cells exhibited little if any fluorescence of either color . the nature of these cells was not investigated. intact embryos appeared to express both fluorescent proteins uniformly and ubiquitously . nevertheless, embryos could have contained a small number of cells that fail to express either fluorescent protein.

a few cells in each mef population exhibited more than a  <dig> fold difference in cfp and yfp fluorescence and were suspected of being monochromatic . the number of cells expressing yfp only was approximately the same as the number of cells expressing cfp only . apparent monochromatic cells of both colors were selected by sorting and placed in culture, but did not survive, precluding further phenotypic and genetic analysis. the reason for the failure of these cells to form clonal colonies was not investigated, but factors that might have caused this result include the low plating efficiency of single mefs and the fact that the populations that were sorted had been passed several times prior to sorting.

fluorescence phenotypes of cells in populations of biallelic es cells
two r26cy es cell lines were independently derived and studied. figures 1d and 1e show facs data obtained from these two cell lines. in addition to the points produced by es cells, the facs plots contained a relatively small number of points produced by autofluorescence of the feeder cells present in the es cell cultures.

the fluorescent phenotypes in the two es cell lines were similar to those seen in the three r26cy mef cell lines  except that the fluorescence emitted by each protein in a typical es cell was about a third as intense as that seen in a typical r26cy mef cell. nearly all of the es cells in each population exhibited both cfp and yfp fluorescence . in a given cell, normalized cfp and yfp signal intensities tended to be approximately equal, but coordination of expression was not perfect. the two es cell lines, r26cy <dig>  exhibited intrinsic noise levels of  <dig> , similar to that exhibited by r26cy mefs.

noise is expected to produce cells that exhibit cfp and yfp fluorescence intensities that differ over time. to determine if this were the case, a population in which the cells were two fold brighter with respect to cfp than yfp was obtained by facs, placed in culture and passed  <dig> times. analysis by facs showed that the original phenotype  was not maintained. instead the population resembled those shown in figure  <dig>  hence, the phenotype of the population was transient, as would be expected if it were due to noise.

both r26cy lines contained rare cells that appeared to be monochromatic . these cells occurred at a frequency of approximately 10- <dig> and apparent cfp and yfp monochromatic variants occurred in roughly equal numbers in both es cell populations . to determine if they were stable variants, apparent monochromatic cells were gated into collection tubes, plated at low density and cloned. examination of  <dig> clonal cultures by fluorescent microscopy showed that about 80% of them exhibited the expected monochromatic phenotype . the remaining 20% were dichromatic, indicating that the sorting method produced populations of cells that were highly enriched for monochromatic cells, but that some dichromatic cells passed through the gates. subsequent experiments using mixtures of monochromatic and dichromatic es cells showed that using more narrow gates reduced the recovery of true monochromatic cells . therefore, quantification of monochromatic cells was more accurate when gates were set wide and dichromatic cells that were misidentified by facs were later detected by microscopy.

spontaneously arising stable monochromatic es cells lacked the gene encoding the non-expressed fluorescent protein
to determine if gene loss contributed to the production of monochromatic es cells, pcr was used to amplify fluorescent protein genes and amplicons were analyzed by digestion with the restriction endonuclease pst <dig> because the yfp gene has a pst <dig> cleavage site that the cfp gene lacks . all spontaneously occurring monochromatic es cell clones analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis  lacked the gene encoding the absent fluorescent protein. to confirm these results, pcr products from  <dig> monochromatic es cell clones  were cloned and sequenced. at least  <dig> cloned amplicon copies from each of the  <dig> monochromatic es cell clones were sequenced. all of the sequences from a given monochromatic cell line were identical to the gene encoding the fluorescent protein observed in that cell line. as a control, pcr products from a dichromatic es cell population were cloned and sequenced. sequences from cfp and yfp genes were both present and equally abundant, as expected. three additional monochromatic clones were analyzed by southern blot hybridization, which showed that each had lost the gene encoding the absent fluorescent protein .

analysis of a centromeric marker in cells with loh at rosa26
to investigate the nature of the events that produced allele loss at the rosa <dig> locus, a centromeric heterozygous microsatellite  was identified. the d6mit <dig> locus is  <dig> mbp from the centromere and  <dig> mbp from the rosa <dig> locus. heterozygosity was retained at the d6mit <dig> locus in  <dig> of  <dig> spontaneous monochromatic clones examined, suggesting that 60% of spontaneous monochromatic clones were produced by mitotic crossovers within the  <dig> mbp interval between the d6mit <dig> microsatellite marker and rosa <dig>  in the other  <dig> monochromatic clones, heterozygosity was lost at the d6mit <dig> locus. such a result was consistent with loss of one homologue of chromosome  <dig>  although loh at both d6mit <dig> and rosa <dig> might have been caused by mitotic recombination taking place in the  <dig> mb interval between the centromere and d6mit <dig> 

the possibility of chromosome  <dig> monosomy was tested by whole chromosome painting of metaphase chromosomes in two of the  <dig> monochromatic clones that were homozygous at d6mit <dig>  all metaphase spreads examined were disomic for chromosome  <dig> . these data, along with the fact that autosomal monosomy has not been described in mouse es cell lines, suggested that chromosome loss without re-duplication was not a major contributing mechanism of allele loss.

copy number of chromosome  <dig> in parental es cell lines
upd would explain the monochromatic cells that were disomic for chromosome  <dig> yet had loh near the centromere. development of upd would be facilitated by trisomy for chromosome  <dig> in the parental cell lines. therefore, it was of interest to determine if either of the parental r26cy es cell lines had this karyotype. to that end,  <dig> cells in cell line r26cy <dig> were subjected to spectral karyotyping, and  <dig> cells in cell line r26cy <dig> were analyzed by whole chromosome painting. all cells analyzed contained  <dig> copies of chromosome  <dig>  these data established with 95% confidence that the fraction of cells with trisomy  <dig> was 5% or less in cell line r26cy <dig> and 7% or less in cell line r26cy <dig> 

frequency of monochromatic es cells and estimated rate of loh
the original facs experiments showed that monochromatic variants occurred at frequencies of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in the r26cy <dig> and r26cy <dig> es cell lines, respectively. these data were acquired from populations of cells that had been derived from blastocysts and kept in culture for several months. thus, it was possible that the frequencies of monochromatic variants were inflated by their accumulation over time. to examine the relationship between frequencies of monochromatic cells and the rate at which they arise, preexisting monochromatic cells were removed from populations of r26cy cells by facs. these dichromatic cell populations were expanded for  <dig> population doublings in culture, and then subjected to facs analysis. monochromatic cells were present on the order of 10- <dig> in both cell lines. monochromatic cells expressing only blue were approximately as frequent as those expressing only yellow.

variants can be either more of less frequent than otherwise dictated by their rate of formation if they proliferate more or less rapidly than parental cells. to determine if monochromatic cells might proliferate more rapidly than their dichromatic parents, growth kinetics of clonal populations of different fluorescent phenotypes were studied. the different clonally derived populations exhibited a variety of growth rates, but fluorescent phenotype and growth rate were not correlated . in addition, an increase in proliferation rate upon loss of one fluorescent protein seems an improbable scenario for two reasons. first, monochromatic cells did not exhibit less fluorescent signal than dichromatic cells, suggesting that the amount of fluorescent protein in monochromatic cells was not less than in dichromatic cells. second, although it has been reported that it is possible to cause ill effects by over expressing gfp  <cit> , there is little evidence of general toxicity associated with fluorescent proteins, which have been used in many es cell lines  <cit>  and in transgenic mice, which are often generated from es cells expressing one fluorescent protein or another  <cit> . in the case of mice carrying cfp and yfp genes at rosa <dig>  the animals are viable and reproduce normally, as do mice homozygous for either cfp or yfp at rosa <dig>  <cit> .

these data suggested that the frequencies of monochromatic cells present in populations of r26cy cells reflected the rate of their production and that the two types of monochromatic variants arose at essentially the same rate, which can be estimated from the relationship between frequency of variants and the number of reproductive cycles  the population has undergone, where rate equals the proportion of variants in a final culture divided by the number of generations that have elapsed  <cit> . by this calculation, the rate of loh in both cell lines was approximately 10- <dig> per cell-generation.

induction of mutation in bichromatic es cells
because all  <dig> spontaneous monochromatic es cell clones examined exhibited loh at the rosa <dig> locus, it was of interest to determine if loh were the only pathway capable of producing this phenotype. therefore, r26cy <dig> es cells were treated with ethylmethanesulfonate , which is a strong inducer of point mutations. the cell population exposed to ems exhibited  <dig>  fold more monochromatic cells as assessed by facs followed by microscopy.

twenty-five monochromatic clones isolated from ems-treated r26cy <dig> es cells populations were subjected to dna analysis by pcr followed by pst <dig> digestion. five of the  <dig> clones retained both the cfp and yfp genes, suggesting that a point mutation had caused loss of expression of one fluorescent protein gene in 20% of the monochromatic cells produced following treatment with ems. to test this hypothesis and determine the nature of these mutations,  <dig> of the clones that retained both fluorescent protein genes were subjected to sequence analysis. as expected, all  <dig> monochromatic clones harbored a mutant version of the non-expressed fluorescent protein gene, and the mutation predicted an alteration in the encoded protein sequence . the mutation found in clone r26cy  <dig> cfp- <dig>  which expressed cfp but not yfp, explained the lack of yfp fluorescence because the yfp gene contained a frameshift mutation predicted to completely block production of the yfp peptide by stopping translation at codon  <dig>  the mutations observed in the other two biallelic but monochromatic es cell clones altered the amino acid sequence and were predicted to change the protein in ways that could extinguish fluorescence.

discussion
populations of biallelic dichromatic mouse embryo cells contained numerous cells in which fluorescence of cfp and yfp were not equivalent. in about one in ten thousand cells, cfp and yfp fluorescence were highly disproportionate. this phenotype arose by the spontaneous loss of the gene encoding either cfp or yfp. the number of cells with this type of loh could be determined by a combination of facs followed by microscopic observation of populations originating from individual sorted cells.

while rare mutant cells exhibited highly disproportionate fluorescence, similar but nonequivalent cfp and yfp fluorescence was seen in most of the cells in biallelic dichromatic populations. these variations in relative fluorescence were transient and presumably produced by expression noise.

genetic instability in mouse es cells
the rate of loh inferred from the frequency of monochromatic es cells is similar to rates reported in most other studies on loh in mouse es cells. loh rates at  <dig> different mapped loci each carrying an inserted neo gene have been reported to range between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> events per cell generation  <cit> . experiments on cells carrying neo genes inserted at unknown loci produced similar results  <cit> . studies using other markers also reported rates of loh within the range suggested by the frequency of monochromatic cells  <cit> . in contrast to the rates reported in most studies, experiments using es cells heterozygous at the aprt locus indicated that spontaneous loh occurred at a rate of approximately  <dig> × 10- <dig> events per cell generation  <cit> . it is not clear why the rate of allele loss at the aprt locus differed from those seen at other loci, but it is possible that chromosome  <dig> behaves differently from other chromosomes in this respect.

in mouse es cells heterozygous at the aprt locus, about 40% of loh events had occurred via mitotic recombination and upd was the most common genetic change associated with loh at aprt  <cit> . similar results were reported for the fasi locus, where a third of the cells with loh were produced by mitotic recombination  <cit> . lefevbre et al showed that loh with respect to integrated neo genes was accompanied by loh at linked markers, but did not attempt to distinguish between mitotic recombination and upd as the cause of these events  <cit> .

our studies on biallelic dichromatic mouse es cells suggest that loh at rosa <dig> occurred principally by mitotic recombination occurring between rosa <dig> and the dmit <dig> marker that is  <dig> cm from the centromere. however, because a heterozygous locus telomeric to rosa <dig> could not be found, it is not possible to exclude interstitial deletion encompassing the rosa <dig> locus but too small to produce an obvious decrease in the size of chromosome  <dig>  nevertheless, interstitial deletion seems an unlikely contributor because such events rarely generate spontaneous loh in es cells  <cit> .

about 40% of the cells had loh at both d6mit <dig> and rosa <dig>  this genotype might have been caused by mitotic recombination taking place in the  <dig> mb interval between the centromere and d6mit <dig>  however, the frequency of monochromatic clones with loh at both d6mit <dig> and rosa <dig> was two fold higher than would be expected to be produced solely by mitotic recombination, assuming these events occur in proportion to the distance between markers. we would expect recombination in the  <dig> mbp interval between the centromere and the d6mit <dig> locus to occur 36%  as frequently as recombination in the  <dig> mbp interval between the d6mit <dig> locus, where recombination produced 12/ <dig>  loh events. therefore, only  <dig> of the  <dig> clones with loh at d6mit <dig> would seem to be attributable to mitotic recombination. mechanisms other than mitotic recombination that might have contributed to the development of loh at both loci include upd and monosomy. upd seems more likely because monosomy is very rarely seen in mammalian cells and has not been seen at all in mouse es cells  <cit> .

potential of biallelic fluorescent markers for studies on genetic instability
findings obtained in these studies on biallelic dichromatic es cells suggest that this approach can be extended to tissues isolated from mice. gfp has been shown to be useful for detecting chromosome loss in hela cells and in mouse brain  <cit> . in a similar fashion, monochromatic cells in tissues from dichromatic mice can be identified and isolated by facs. in addition, it may be possible to detect monochromatic cells in situ in tissue sections. while other approaches provide data on mutation and mis-segregation events in tissues, only the dichromatic model can provide information about the locations of variant cells within tissues, and this information has the potential to reveal mitotic recombination events because such events can generate twin spots composed of neighboring patches of monochromatic cells of different colors descended from the monochromatic daughter cells produced from a mitotic cell that has undergone crossing over between homologous chromosomes  <cit> .

sources and features of expression noise
mouse cells exhibited both extrinsic and intrinsic noise, the two types of variation seen in expression of allelic genes in yeast and bacteria  <cit> . extrinsic noise refers to variation in the fluorescence intensity emitted by a given fluorescent protein in different cells in the population  <cit> , and is thought to be due to variation among cells with respect to parameters such as position in the cell cycle. es cells and mefs exhibited similar levels of extrinsic noise, which may seem surprising given that mef populations are derived from the numerous cell types present in a  <dig>  dpc embryo, while es cell populations contain a single cell type. however, many of the diverse cell types present in a dissociated embryo appear to fail to proliferate, and cells resembling fibroblasts quickly predominate in mef cultures. another factor that may work to minimize extrinsic noise caused by heterogeneity with respect to cell types is the robust activity of the rosa <dig> promoter, which is driving transcription of the fluorescent protein genes. this promoter is known to function in a wide array of cell types  <cit> .

intrinsic noise refers to the discordance in the intensities of the two fluorescent proteins within a single cell, and is thought to be due to lack of coordination with respect to processes such as assembly of transcription complexes at allelic promoters  <cit> . this lack of coordination is thought to result from stochastic variation caused by a scarcity of factors needed to accomplish gene expression. intrinsic noise occurred in both types of mouse cells, and to similar extents. the level of intrinsic noise exhibited by mouse cells resembled that seen in e. coli when the promoter driving fluorescent gene transcription was semi-repressed by the lac repressor protein  <cit> . intrinsic noise in e. coli was reduced when repression was lifted and transcription rate was increased, leading to the suggestion that intrinsic noise is inversely related to transcription rate  <cit> . however, studies in yeast showed that the relationship between intrinsic noise and transcription can be more complex  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
loh at rosa <dig> produced monochromatic cells in populations of dichromatic mouse embryonic cells and was usually accompanied by retention of heterozygosity at a locus between rosa <dig> and the centromere, suggesting that mitotic recombination was the major cause of rosa <dig> loh. dichromatic mouse embryonic cells exhibited expression noise, a phenomenon previously described in bacteria and yeast carrying different fluorescent protein genes as allelic markers. dichromatic mouse embryonic cells provide a novel system for studying genetic/karyotypic stability and factors influencing expression from allelic genes in cultured es cells, and suggest that similar approaches will allow these phenomena to be studied in tissues.
