BACKGROUND
low temperatures adversely affect plant quality and productivity and function as a determinant of geographical distribution and growth  <cit> . plants achieve cold tolerance following gradual exposure to low but non-freezing temperatures, a phenomenon called cold acclimation  <cit> . cold acclimation is accompanied by changes at the physiological, molecular and biochemical levels  <cit> .

low temperatures initiate signaling pathways that control the expression of genes encoding determinants necessary for chilling tolerance  <cit> . until now, the ice1-cbf -cold-response pathway has been one of the dominant cold signaling mechanisms mediating cold tolerance in arabidopsis <cit> . cold-regulated genes  encode functional hydrophilic proteins, controlling cell osmoregulation and stabilization under freezing stress  <cit> . dre/crt cis-elements containing the core sequence ccgac have been identified from these cor promoters  <cit> . transcription factors known as cbfs  or dreb1s  induce transcription of downstream cor genes via interaction with dre/crt elements  <cit> . the genes encoding cbf transcription factors are up-regulated by cold. the three cbf genes encoding dreb1b/cbf <dig>  dreb1a/cbf <dig>  and dreb1c/cbf <dig> in arabidopsis play a role in the cold acclimation pathway  <cit> . numerous reports have demonstrated that cbf overexpression alleviated damage associated with freezing stress in arabidopsis, rice and non-model plants  <cit> .

several factors involved in regulation of cbf/dreb <dig> expression have been identified genetically in arabidopsis. direct regulators of cbf/dreb <dig> expression include hos <dig>   <cit> , ice <dig>   <cit>  and myb <dig> <cit> . the ice <dig> gene encodes a myc-like bhlh transcription factor that binds directly to canonical myc cis-elements  in the cbf3/dreb1a promoter  <cit> . ice <dig> encodes a homolog of ice <dig>  and primarily influences the expression of cbf1/dreb1b but not that of cbf3/dreb1a <cit> . overexpression of two ices has been associated with enhanced chilling tolerance in arabidopsis, rice, apples and tobacco  <cit> . interestingly, ice1/scream is also involved in stomatal differentiation, suggesting that ice <dig> mediates transcriptional regulation of environmental adaptation and stomatal development in plants  <cit> . in addition, protein interaction analysis reveals that ice <dig> post-translational modification occurs during cold acclimation. freezing tolerance is negatively regulated by hos1-induced degradation of ice <dig> and positively regulated by siz1-mediated sumoylation and stabilization of ice <dig>  <cit> . recent data indicate that serine  <dig> of ice <dig> plays a role in the regulation of transactivation and cold-induced degradation via the ubiquitin/26s proteasome pathway, which is probably mediated by hos <dig>  <cit> . further investigation revealed that several jasmonate zim-domain  proteins, the repressors of jasmonate signaling, physically interact with ice <dig> and ice <dig> transcription factors, decreasing the freezing stress response of arabidopsis <cit> .

micrornas , a class of small non-protein coding rnas containing  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides , have been increasingly investigated as key regulators of gene expression  <cit> . recent evidence indicates that plant mirnas play a role in biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . cold-responsive mirnas in different species enable development of breeding strategies for cold tolerance  <cit> . the mir <dig> is a repressor of cu-zn superoxide dismutase genes , which act as reactive oxygen species  scavengers  <cit> . mir <dig> is regulated in response to oxidative stress, salt, abscisic acid , sucrose treatment and different ambient temperatures, resulting in an immediate change in csd levels  <cit> . over expression of csd protects plants from oxidative stress and enhances freezing stress tolerance in transgenic plants  <cit> . a recent report suggested that mir398-csd positively regulated heat tolerance  <cit> .

the exact mir398-csd pathway involved in the mechanism of freezing tolerance, however, is not completely understood.

in a previous investigation of chrysanthemum freezing tolerance, we isolated cdice <dig> from chrysanthemum dichrum <cit> . in our present study, we further explored cdice <dig> functions under two different cold acclimation conditions, which revealed that cdice <dig> mediates freezing tolerance via cbf and mir <dig> pathways.

RESULTS
cdice <dig> expression
a 1682-base pair promoter of cdice <dig> was isolated using the tail-polymerase chain reaction  method, described in chen  <cit> . its sequence including a few labeled stress-related cis-elements is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  expression analysis of different tissues revealed its constitutive expression at different levels, with the strongest expression found in leaves and stems . cdice <dig> was significantly upregulated by cold, nacl and aba but not by dehydration . under cold and aba stress, cdice <dig> expression increased gradually over the first three hours and then decreased slightly . in addition, cdice <dig> expression was induced under salt stress, with expression peaking at six hours and then declining gradually . no apparent inducible expression of cdice <dig> was detected with 20% polyethylene glycol  dehydration .

subcellular localization of cdice1:gfp fusion protein
to explore the subcellular localization of cdice <dig>  we used a transient assay of cdice1-gfp fusion constructs introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. as shown in figure  <dig>  gfp alone resulted in diffused distribution of green fluorescence throughout the entire cell . in contrast, cdice1-gfp localized predominantly to the nucleus, which was further confirmed by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  staining .

ice <dig> binds to the myc element in the cddreba promoter and activates transcription
to determine whether cdice <dig> binds to myc recognition sites in the cddreba promoter, cdice1-his fusion protein was expressed and purified from pichia pastoris . myc-wt sequences were used to determine the interaction with his–ice <dig> in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay . the results showed that the complex between cdice <dig> and myc-wt was inhibited by the myc-wt competitor, but not by a mutated competitor  , implying a specific interaction between cdice <dig> and myc elements.

a yeast one-hybrid system was used to investigate cdice <dig> transcriptional activity. yeast cells harboring pcl <dig>  pgbkt7-cdice <dig> or pgbkt7-cdice1- <dig> proliferated on sd/his-ade- medium and x-α-gal activity was detected based on blue coloration, unlike pgbkt <dig>  pgbkt7-cdice1- <dig> or pgbkt7-cdice1- <dig> . the data confirmed that cdice <dig> was associated with transactivation activity, suggesting that n’ 22– <dig> amino acids may be required for transactivation.

cdice <dig> positively regulates cbfs associated with freezing tolerance in 
arabidopsis 
at 4°c
transgene overexpression was detected using genomic dna pcr and mrna quantitative reverse transcription pcr  assays  in transgenic plants but not wild-type  arabidopsis. independent t <dig> homozygous transformants cdice1- <dig> and cdice1- <dig> were used for further experiments in freezing tolerance. after freezing treatments , no significant differences in electrolyte leakage  or survival rate were observed between transgenic and non-transgenic plants that were not initially subjected to acclimation . in both transgenic and wt plants, 4°c or 16°c temperature acclimation enhanced freezing tolerance, but plants overexpressing cdice <dig> showed higher survival rates after recovery and lower el than wt ones under both freezing treatments . these data indicate that cdice <dig> plays an important role in cold acclimation-mediated freezing tolerance.

downstream genes of cdice <dig> were further tested using qrt-pcr to determine changes in freezing tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis. acclimation at 16°c did not affect expression of the three cbf genes compared with their levels at 23°c. cdice <dig> overexpression did not alter the transcription of cbf <dig> or  <dig> but there was a slight increase in cbf <dig> . acclimation at 4°c induced their expression, with transgenic plants showing higher cbf expression than wt plants . in two transgenic plants, cbf <dig> expression was higher compared with the other two genes . expression of the three cor genes was also significantly higher in cdice1-overexpressing lines compared with wt plants undergoing acclimation at 16°c or 4°c . these data indicate that during acclimation at 4°c, cdice <dig> mediates freezing tolerance via a cbf-cor pathway, consistent with a previous report  <cit> . acclimation at 16°c was associated with an improved mechanism of cdice <dig> to freezing tolerance inconsistent with acclimation at 4°c.

cdice <dig> negatively regulates the mir398-csd pathway involved in freezing tolerance in arabidopsis under acclimation at 16°c
to further explore the regulatory mechanism of acclimation to 16°c that induces freezing tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis, mir <dig> and csd expression levels were studied. in wt plants, mir <dig> expression was downregulated twofold during acclimation at 16°c for  <dig> hours, while no changes occurred under 4°c . the downregulation due to silencing of all three mir <dig> loci was further examined. rt-pcr showed that primary mir398b  exhibited significant decreases and no alteration in primary mir398a expression at 16°c . the two target genes csd <dig> and csd <dig> were upregulated  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, after  <dig> hours at 16°c .

to elucidate the association of mir398-csds with freezing tolerance, we examined phenotypes of growth recovery after freezing treatment in the three arabidopsis mutants mir398c, csd <dig>  and csd <dig> . after freezing treatment, mir398c mutants exhibited higher survival rates, whereas csd <dig> and csd <dig> showed lower survival compared with wt plants. freezing tolerance of mir398c, csd <dig> and csd <dig> was induced at 4°c/16°c compared with the non-acclimatized plants . the el values in mir398c were always lower while those in csd <dig> and csd <dig> were higher than the wt plants .

expression levels of csd <dig> and csd <dig> were much higher in mir398c mutants compared with wt plants . under non-acclimatized conditions, cdice1-overexpressing plants were no different than wt with respect to expression of mir <dig> and its two target genes csd <dig> and csd <dig> . after  <dig> hours of acclimation at 16°c, however, mir <dig>  mir398b and mir398c in transgenic plants was downregulated compared with wt, and csd <dig> and csd <dig> were upregulated . the freezing tolerance of cdice1-8/mir398c plants  was higher than mir398c after acclimation at 16°c , which may partially result from primary mir398b reduction by cdice <dig> 

discussion
the cdice <dig> gene isolated from c. dichrum encodes a bhlh protein with an amino acid sequence highly similar to that of arabidopsis ice <dig> and ice <dig>  its over-expression increases tolerance to low temperature, drought and salinity stress in chrysanthemum  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism underlying freezing tolerance is not well understood. in this study, cdice <dig> expression was induced by cold, salt and aba, and its nuclear location was confirmed by subcellular localization in vivo. bhlh proteins regulate downstream genes through sequence-specific interactions in the promoter regions  <cit> . in arabidopsis and wheat, ice <dig> acts directly upstream of cbfs by binding to the myc recognition sites present in cbf gene promoters, and then subsequently triggers expression of cbf/dreb regulons  <cit> . based on emsa in the current study, the cdice <dig> protein was found to bind to the myc recognition site of the cddreba promoter. overexpression of cddreba has been previously observed to improve drought and salinity stress tolerance in chrysanthemums  <cit> . in our study, cdice <dig> protein also showed transactivation activity. these results indicate that an ice1-dreb pathway exists in c. dichrum and that cdice <dig> might be a useful transcription factor in chrysanthemum breeding for improvement of stress tolerance.

the cbf cold-responsive pathway is an important cold-acclimation gene network that contributes to cold tolerance  <cit> . a dominant mutation in ice <dig> blocks cold induction of the cbf <dig> regulon and impairs freezing tolerance  <cit> . in contrast, ice <dig> overexpression increases cold tolerance relative to wt plants not only in arabidopsis but also in rice and apples  <cit> . in this study, cdice <dig> overexpression resulted in elevated expression of cbf and three cor genes during 4°c cold acclimation and enhanced tolerance to freezing stress. these data suggest that cdice <dig> acts as a signal transduction component in the cbf pathway and is associated with cold tolerance, similar to ice genes in arabidopsis and wheat  <cit> .

after the discovery of mirnas, researchers recognized the important role of these small rnas in abiotic stress response via posttranscriptional gene regulation  <cit> . in chinese cabbage , extremely high temperature  reduces the mir <dig> level  <cit> . the expression of mir <dig> was also steadily decreased over  <dig> hours under salt stress in arabidopsis <cit> . our study found that the downregulation of mir <dig> is involved in changes associated with a 23°c to 16°c temperature shift , which is consistent with a previous report suggesting that the expression of mir <dig> was significantly lower under ambient temperature  than at 23°c in arabidopsis <cit> . it has been shown that expression of myb, wrky and bhlh family genes is regulated by ice <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> . cis-elements such as myb, wrky or bhlh transcription factor-binding elements were predicted in mir398b and mir398c promoters . therefore, we propose that cdice <dig> decreased the mir <dig> level via ice1-dependent transcription factors  that act as repressors of pri-mir398b .

in arabidopsis, mir398-csds were found to participate in regulation of biotic stress  and abiotic stresses such as cu2+, uv, ozone, salt, aba and heat  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing a mir398-resistant form of csd <dig> accumulate more csd <dig> mrna than plants overexpressing a regular csd <dig>  the transgenic plants were more tolerant to increased radiation, heavy metals and other oxidative stresses  <cit> . in this study, the downregulated expression of mir <dig> at 16°c induced expression of two csd genes . freezing tolerance was negatively regulated by mir <dig> levels and improved by csd genes, consistent with a previous study demonstrating that csd overexpression elevated the freezing tolerance of alfalfa  <cit> . cdice1-overexpressing plants induced higher ros content compared with wt plants during the initial stages  of acclimation to 16°c, while no significant difference in ros levels was observed between wt and transgenic plants after  <dig> hours at 16°c . we speculate that early induction of ros might act as a signal to reduce mir <dig> expression in response to acclimation at 16°c. the reduction in mir <dig> in turn increased the expression of cds <dig> and csd <dig> that eliminated the ros with similar ros levels between wt plants and cdice1-overexpressing plants after  <dig> hours at 16°c . in addition, freezing tolerance assays of wt, mir398c mutant and cdice1/mir398c  at 16°c showed that cdice1/mir398c plants were more tolerant compared with the mir398c mutant , suggesting that down regulation of mir398c was one of the ice1-regulated pathways. taken together, overexpression of cdice <dig> resulted in a decrease in mir <dig> expression levels following transition from 23°c to 16°c, indicating that cdice <dig> induced freezing tolerance partially via the mir398-csd pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
the different alterations in ambient temperature resulted in improvement in freezing tolerance. upon transition from 23°c to 4°c, the ice family genes played an important role in inducing the expression of cbf genes, consistent with past results. however, interesting data showed that cdice <dig> from c. dichrum regulated freezing tolerance of arabidopsis partly through the mir398-csd pathway following transition from 23°c to 16°c.
