BACKGROUND
proteases play essential roles in biological systems, not only digestion and protein turnover but also a diversity of specific processes  <cit> . to regulate the activity of proteases and avoid cellular damage, organisms also produce protease inhibitors  <cit> . so far,  <dig> distinct families of protease inhibitors have been described, one of which is the kazal family of serine protease inhibitors   <cit> . kazal type inhibitors are widely distributed in animals, apicomplexans and oomycetes. they are thought to play important roles in maintenance of normal cellular and physiological processes of animals  <cit> , and pathogenesis of mammalian parasitic apicomplexans and plant pathogenic oomycetes  <cit> . kazal-like serine protease inhibitors are defined by a conserved motif in their amino acid sequences. typical kazal domains contain six cysteine residues forming a 1–5/2–4/3– <dig> disulfide bond pattern  <cit> . most kazal domains described so far belong to this class. however, a novel class of kazal domains has been described in recent years, in which the third and sixth cysteines are missing resulting in the loss of the 3– <dig> disulfide bond  <cit> . these two disulfide bridge domains are referred to here as atypical kazal domains.

atypical kazal domains were first reported in the human serine proteinase inhibitor lekti, a 15-domain inhibitor associated with the severe congenital disease netherton syndrome  <cit> . domain  <dig> and  <dig> of lekti are typical kazal domains with complete  <dig> cysteine residues, whereas the remaining  <dig> domains represent atypical two disulfide bridge kazal domains  <cit> . the functionality of some atypical kazal domains from lekti has been examined. domain  <dig> of lekti does not inhibit any of the standard proteases  <cit> . domain  <dig> exhibits significant inhibitory activity on trypsin, but this inhibition is only temporary  <cit> . a recombinant protein containing four atypical domains of lekti  inhibits both trypsin and subtilisin a permanently  <cit> , indicating that atypical kazal domains can be effective inhibitors. however, it is unclear whether a single atypical domain can be a stable inhibitor. multi-domain interactions could be responsible for the stable inhibitory activity observed for the recombinant protein  <cit> . additional structural and functional studies on atypical kazal domains are needed to understand the impact of the disulfide bridges on inhibitor activity and stability.

as a result of exhaustive biochemical studies of the third domain of turkey ovomucoid protein performed by the late michael laskowski jr. and collaborators, much is known about the relationship between domain sequence and inhibition specificity in kazal inhibitor-serine protease interactions. this work culminated in the development of an additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm, referred to from here on as the laskowski algorithm, that predicts the inhibition constants  between kazal domains and a set of six serine proteases based solely on the sequence of the inhibitors  <cit> . structural studies of kazal domain-protease complexes revealed that there are  <dig> contact positions  responsible for interactions between kazal domains and their cognate serine proteases  <cit> . changes in noncontact residues often do not affect equilibrium constants , whereas changes in contact residues result in significant alterations of ka  <cit> . among the  <dig> contact residues, p <dig>  the second conserved cysteine residue, and p15', a conserved asparagine, show little variation in naturally occurring kazal domains, but the remaining ten contact residues are hypervariable  <cit> . therefore, the laskowski algorithm was established based on the residues at the  <dig> contact positions and allows for the calculation of ka or ki of a kazal domain against a selected set of six serine proteases based on the domain sequence alone  <cit> . this algorithm was developed based on  <dig> variants of turkey ovomucoid third domain  and was validated with a number of typical kazal domains  <cit> . theoretically, the algorithm should be applicable to atypical kazal domains since the missing cysteine residues are different from the hypervariable contact residues. however, the accuracy of the algorithm in predicting the reactivity of atypical kazal domains has not been tested .

kazal-like inhibitors are ubiquitous in oomycetes  <cit> , a group of eukaryotic microbes that includes many devastating plant pathogens  <cit> . a total of  <dig> putative extracellular proteins with  <dig> predicted kazal-like domains were identified from five plant pathogenic oomycete species  <cit> . among them, the phytophthora infestans kazal inhibitors epi <dig> and epi <dig> inhibit and interact with the pathogenesis-related p69b subtilisin-like serine protease of the host plant tomato, suggesting a role in virulence  <cit> . both epi <dig> and epi <dig> contain an atypical kazal domain  <cit> . atypical domains are common in kazal-like inhibitors of plant pathogenic oomycetes. one-fourth  of oomycete kazal domains belong to this type  <cit> . these domains are distributed in  <dig> different proteins from three phytophthora species, p. infestans, p. ramorum and p. sojae, some of which have multiple domains. remarkably, phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> domains revealed that all the atypical domains form a significantly distinct cluster , suggesting that the loss of one disulfide bridge in phytophthora kazal-like domains predates speciation. characterizing the atypical kazal domains would help to understand the biochemical and biological functions of these inhibitors.

p. infestans epi <dig> is an ideal candidate to characterize atypical kazal domains. epi <dig> was identified as a tight-binding inhibitor of subtilisin a and inhibits and interacts with p69b subtilisin-like serine protease  <cit> . epi <dig> is composed of two putative kazal domains, atypical domain epi1a and typical domain epi1b  <cit> . the predicted  <dig> contact residues of both domains follow the kazal consensus, with p <dig> and p15' conserved cysteines and asparagines, respectively, and the remaining  <dig> contact residues variable relative to other kazal domains. in this study, we predicted the inhibition constants of epi1a and epi1b to subtilisin a using the laskowski algorithm  <cit> . the atypical domain epi1a, but not the typical domain epi1b, was predicted to be a strong inhibitor of subtilisin a. a recombinant epi1a exhibited stable inhibitory activity against subilisin a and appeared solely responsible for inhibition and interaction with tomato p69b subtilase, providing evidence that the missing two cysteine residues and the corresponding disulfide bond might not be essential for inhibitor reactivity and stability. this report also suggests that the additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm  originally developed and validated with typical kazal domains might operate accurately for atypical domains.

RESULTS
the atypical kazal domain of epi <dig> is predicted to be a functional inhibitor of subtilisin a
the inhibition constants of two kazal domains of epi <dig> against subtilisin a were predicted using the laskowski algorithm  <cit>  based on the sequence of their  <dig> hypervariable contact residues . interestingly, the atypical kazal domain epi1a was predicted to be a strong inhibitor of subtilisin a with a ki of  <dig>  nm, a value that is remarkably similar to the experimentally determined ki of  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  nm for the entire epi <dig> protein against subtilisin a  <cit> . in contrast, the typical kazal domain epi1b, which contains the complete set of six cysteine residues, may not be functional against subtilisin a since the predicted ki was high at  <dig> mm. therefore, these computational analyses predicted that the atypical domain epi1a is solely responsible for the inhibition of subtilisin a.

expression and purification of the two kazal domains of epi1
to test the protease inhibitory activities of epi1a and epi1b, the two kazal domains of epi <dig>  and assess the predictions of the laskowski algorithm, we expressed and purified the two recombinant domains in escherichia coli as fusion proteins with the flag epitope tag at the amino-terminus. the sequences of the recombinant proteins are shown in fig. 2a. the predicted molecular mass for flag-epi1a  and flag-epi1b  was  <dig> da and  <dig> da, respectively. to determine the purity of the purified recombinant proteins, we ran  <dig>  μg of purified repi1a and repi1b on sds-page gel and stained with silver nitrate. bands of the expected sizes were observed for both proteins. there was only a single band for repi1b, indicating high purity . the repi1a sample revealed two closely-migrating bands . the two bands reacted to the flag antibody and are likely to represent repi1a with and without the signal peptide ompa, which is located immediately before the flag peptide in the vector pflag-ats and is responsible for secreted expression in e. coli. similar release of the mature protein was commonly observed with other proteins expressed using pflag-ats . we also stained the gel loaded with purified repi1a protein with coomassie blue. compared with the band corresponding to the repi1a without ompa, the slower-migrating band was much weaker , indicating the secreted version of repi1a was the major component of the purified repi1a protein solution. besides these two bands, no other proteins were detected by silver staining suggesting that the repi1a preparation was highly pure.

the atypical kazal domain epi1a inhibits the serine protease subtilisin a
we performed inhibition assays of subtilisin a by incubating  <dig>  μm of subtilisin a with  <dig>  μm of repi1a, repi1b or buffer control in a volume of  <dig> μl. the remaining protease activity was measured using the quanticleave™ protease assay kit as described in methods. in repeated assays, repi1a was found to inhibit about 91% of the measured activity of subtilisin a, whereas repi1b did not display any significant inhibition . these results are consistent with the prediction of the laskowski algorithm . it is unlikely that the flag tag interfered with the inhibitory activities considering that both the active repi1a and inactive repi1b carry the flag sequence and that these experiments were conducted in parallel.

epi1a inhibits the tomato pathogenesis-related p69b subtilase
epi <dig> inhibits and interacts with the pathogenesis-related p69b subtilase of tomato  <cit> . to test which of the two domains of epi <dig> inhibits p69b, we first used agroinfiltration to transiently express p69b fused with the epitope tag ha at the c-terminus in nicotiana benthamiana leaves. intercellular fluids were collected from leaves infiltrated with either agrobacterium tumefaciens containing pcb302-p69b, or a. tumefaciens containing the empty binary vector pcb302- <dig>   <dig> μl of intercellular fluids from the two treatments were used in in-gel protease assays. a distinct additional protease band was observed in the p69b-expressing sample but not in the control suggesting that p69b-ha is functional .  <dig> μl of p69b-expressing n. benthamiana intercellular fluids were incubated with  <dig> pmol of the epi <dig> recombinant protein repi <dig>  <cit> , repi1a, repi1b, or buffer and the remaining protease activity was detected by in-gel protease assay. repi1a, containing the atypical kazal domain, completely inhibited the p69b band similar to repi <dig>  repi <dig> and repi1a also inhibited the activity of two other extracellular proteases from n. benthamiana . the identity of these n. benthamiana proteases is unknown but they could also be subtilisin-like serine proteases, such as homologs of tomato p <dig>  in these experiments, repi1b did not exhibit any inhibition towards p69b or other protease bands.

epi1a interacts with tomato p69
we previously showed that repi <dig> interacts with p69b  <cit> . here, we tested whether the atypical kazal domain epi1a interacts with p69b subtilase by coimmunoprecipitation. coimmunoprecipitation was performed on bth-induced tomato intercellular fluids incubated with repi1a, repi1b or buffer control using flag antibody covalently linked agarose beads. western blots were hybridized sequentially with p <dig> and flag antisera and revealed that p <dig> subtilases co-precipitated with repi1a . this indicates that repi1a interacts with p <dig> subtilases. since the p <dig> family of subtilases have at least six homologs   <cit>  and the peptide used to generate the p <dig> antisera is conserved among several homologs  <cit> , we cannot conclude that p69b subtilase is the only protein that was pulled down with repi1a. in contrast to repi1a, repi1b could not be detected after coimmunoprecipitation with bth-induced tomato intercellular fluids . however, repi1b was detected in control coimmunoprecipitations with the extraction buffer of tomato intercellular fluids , suggesting that this protein is not stable in bth-induced tomato intercellular fluids.

epi1a exhibits stable inhibitory activity
to determine whether epi1a is a temporary or stable inhibitor of subtilisin, we performed stability analyses by incubating subtilisin a with or without repi1a for increasing periods of time and measuring the remaining protease activity. to determine the optimal concentration of epi1a for the stability analyses, we first performed inhibition assays with varying concentrations of epi1a . the concentration of  <dig>  μm of epi1a resulted in inhibition levels of about 80% of the measured protease activity and was selected for the stability analysis. this concentration is within the linear part of the curve , suggesting that hydrolysis of repi1a could be easily detected as a decrease in inhibitory activity. the inhibitory activity of repi1a did not show any decrease over  <dig> hours of incubation with subtilisin a , indicating that epi1a is a stable inhibitor of subtilisin a. these results are in sharp contrast with those reported for domain ld- <dig> of lekti, which lost 50% of inhibitory activity after  <dig> hour of incubation with trypsin and lost all inhibitory effect after 3– <dig> hours  <cit> .

discussion
atypical kazal domains with two disulfide bridges occur in biologically important molecules. the 15-domain human serine protease inhibitor lekti that carries  <dig> atypical kazal domains is associated with the severe congenital disorder netherton syndrome  <cit> . the protease inhibitors epi <dig> and epi <dig> of p. infestans contain an atypical kazal domain and have been implicated in virulence of this devastating plant pathogen  <cit> . although the structure and function of atypical kazal domains from lekti have been studied, the effects of the loss of cys  <dig>  cys  <dig> and the corresponding disulfide bond on inhibitor reactivity and stability was not assessed and there is no evidence showing that a single atypical kazal domain can be a stable inhibitor by itself  <cit> . in this study, we describe that the atypical domain epi1a of the two-domain epi <dig> protein is a stable inhibitor of the subtilisin family of serine proteases. no loss of inhibitory activity was found even after incubating epi1a with subtilisin a for  <dig> hours. the loss of cys  <dig>  cys  <dig> and the corresponding disulfide bond does not have major adverse effects on inhibitory activity or stability, indicating that these two cysteine residues might not be essential for the function of kazal domains. this finding is important for determining the biochemical and biological functions of kazal inhibitors containing atypical kazal domain. kazal-like proteins have been reported from animals, apicomplexans, oomycetes, as well as the bacterium nitrosomonas europaea  <cit> . the availability of genomic sequence from a diversity of organisms is likely to reveal an increasing number of atypical kazal inhibitors. for example, so far, a total of  <dig> atypical kazal domains have been identified in plant pathogenic oomycetes  <cit> .

the structural mechanism underlying the stability of epi1a is not clear. the three-dimensional structure of the atypical domain  <dig>  of lekti was determined. the overall structure of ld <dig> resembles the three-dimensional fold of typical kazal-type inhibitors, but the backbone geometry of its canonical loop is not well defined, providing a possible explanation for its temporary inhibitory activity  <cit> . there are  <dig> residues between the first cysteine residue  and the second one  in ld <dig>  instead of 6– <dig> in most typical kazal domains  <cit> . the lack of one disulfide bond and the longer sequence stretch between the first two cysteines were proposed to be the factors responsible for the instability of ld <dig>  <cit> . indeed, the longer sequence stretch between the first two cysteines could explain the difference between epi1a and ld <dig>  there are only  <dig> residues between cys  <dig> and cys  <dig> in epi1a, which is shorter than in most kazal domains. the longer sequence stretch of ld <dig> might lead to the abnormal canonical loop and the non-permanent inhibitory activity. future work to determine the three-dimensional structure of epi1a and compare it with ld <dig> of lekti and other kazal domains should help to unravel the structural mechanism underlying the functionality of atypical kazal domains.

the laskowski algorithm was developed and validated based on typical kazal domains  <cit> . the algorithm exploits an exhaustive analysis of all amino acid variants in the ten hypervariable contact residues of turkey ovomucoid third domain, a typical kazal domain. the accuracy of the algorithm in predicting the reactivity of atypical kazal domains has not been evaluated . here we found that the algorithm correctly predicted which of the two epi domains is likely to inhibit subtilisins. our experimental data showed that the atypical kazal domain epi1a inhibited subtilisin a, and inhibited and interacted with p <dig> subtilase similar to the entire epi <dig> protein  <cit> . also, using the algorithm, the atypical kazal domain epi1a was predicted to be a strong inhibitor of subtilisin a with a predicted ki of  <dig>  nm, which was in very good agreement with the experimentally determined ki of  <dig>  +/-  <dig> nm  <cit> . as expected from the predicted ki of  <dig> mm, the typical epi1b domain was not an effective inhibitor of subtilisin a. in summary, it appears that the laskowski algorithm operates accurately for atypical kazal domains such as epi1a. perhaps, this is expected since the cys  <dig> and cys  <dig> residues of typical kazal domains are not contact positions. nonetheless, our observations and the concordance between predicted and experimental data suggest that gross structural changes that could result from the loss of one disulfide bridge in atypical kazal domains may not affect the specificity of the interactions between kazal domains and their cognate serine proteases.

atypical kazal domains are ubiquitous in serine protease inhibitors of plant pathogenic oomycetes. fourteen of a total of  <dig> kazal-like domains identified in five plant pathogenic oomycetes have only four cysteines. two of these kazal-like inhibitors epi <dig> and epi <dig> of p. infestans target the defense-related protease p69b of the host plant tomato. the first atypical kazal domain of epi <dig> appears to be solely functional in inhibiting and interacting with p69b. in the three-domain epi <dig>  the second domain is also an atypical domain that was predicted to be functional against subtilisin based on the laskowski algorithm  <cit> . these findings raise some interesting questions. what are the biochemical and biological implications of the loss of the disulfide bridge? are there any evolutionary advantages of the two-disulfide bridge kazal domain over the three-disulfide bridge domain in counteracting and co-evolving with host proteases? additional functional and structural studies are needed to address these questions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the functionality of a two disulfide bridge atypical kazal domain epi1a from phytophthora was characterized. epi1a was predicted to be a strong inhibitor of subtilisin a using the additivity-based sequence to reactivity algorithm . inhibition assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that recombinant domain epi1a exhibited stable inhibitory activity against subilisin a and was solely responsible for inhibition and interaction with tomato p69b subtilase, providing evidence that the missing two cysteines and their corresponding disulfide bond are not essential for inhibitor reactivity and stability. this report also suggests that the laskowski algorithm originally developed and validated with typical kazal domains might operate accurately for atypical kazal domains.
