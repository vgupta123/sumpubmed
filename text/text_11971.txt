BACKGROUND
production volumes of bio-based lipids have experienced a 65% increase over the last decade due to increasing demands by food, chemical- and pharmaceutical industries  <cit> . especially the application of natural oils for biofuels, oleochemicals and bioactive substances is expanding rapidly  <cit> . however, the application of plant oils for non-food use accelerates land use and climate change, which in turn negatively impacts on biodiversity. further, the majority of pharmaceutically active high value lipids such as long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are still sourced from fish and crustaceans, which negatively affects sensitive marine ecosystems.

microbial oils have been designated as a sustainable alternative to plant and animal based lipids. in particular, oleaginous yeast, which can accumulate between  <dig> and 70% w/w lipids  <cit>  have gained increasing interest as providers for sustainable oleochemical building blocks in the biofuel, lubricant, food and cosmetics industry. however, induction of lipogenesis in microorganisms is linked to nutrient restriction , which results in significant reductions in cell growth. in order to design an economically relevant continuous production process that provides for high lipid and biomass formation the metabolic uncoupling of cell growth from intracellular lipid accumulation is a prerequisite. this aim however requires in depth knowledge of the cells regulatory mechanisms involved in lipogenesis.

the target of rapamycin complexes  are central, highly conserved regulators in the control of cell proliferation, sexual development, cell skeleton organization, lipogenesis and other essential functions. torcs draw their name from the torc <dig> inhibiting heterocyclic makrolid rapamycin, derived from streptomyces hygroscopicus. the complexes consist of different components depending on the organism. the key component is tor <dig>  a phosphatidylinositol  <dig> kinase-like serine/threonine kinase .

whereas some involvement of torcs, such as torc <dig> activation of translation and transcription are conserved from yeast over plants to mammals  <cit> , other downstream processes are vastly different depending on the organism. it is reported that the signaling network plays a crucial role in the control of lipid homeostasis  <cit> . understanding the regulatory system of lipid accumulation would therefore contribute to the ability for targeted, genetic modification of single cell oil production strains.

recently, the effects of rapamycin on the lipid accumulating microalgae euglena gracilis in comparison to model algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cyanidioschyzon merolae were characterized  <cit> . lipid content was significantly increased when the algae were exposed to minor concentrations of rapamycin. by contrast, higher rapamycin concentrations resulted in growth inhibition. while the effect of rapamycin has been well described in model yeasts, it has as of now not been evaluated in non-conventional oil forming yeasts strains. therefore, this study evaluates the significance of torc signaling pathways on lipogenesis in oleaginous yeast for the first time.

methods
strains and media
wild type trichosporon oleaginosus atcc  <dig> , obtained from the “deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen”   was used for all experiments. cultivation was done in ypd medium , nitrogen limitation medium  <cit>  2so <dig>   <dig>  g/l; mgso4•7h2o,  <dig>  g/l; kh2po <dig>   <dig>  g/l; na2hpo <dig>  <dig>  g/l; cacl2•h2o,  <dig>  g/l; znso4•7h2o,  <dig>  μg/l; mncl2•4h2o,  <dig>  μg/l; cuso4•5h2o, 25 μg/l; feso4•7h2o, 25 μg/l, ph  <dig> ). rapamycin  was solved in dmso  and added directly to the media in different concentrations after the inoculation.

cultivation conditions

t. oleaginosus was cultivated as triplicate in yeast extract peptone dextrose medium  with different concentrations of rapamycin solution for 7 days at 28 °c in 500 ml baffled shake flasks. cultivation was carried out in 100 ml ypd and nitrogen limitation medium  with glucose. cells from an overnight culture grown in ypd medium under the same cultivation conditions were washed in ddh2o and used to inoculate all cultivations at od600 =  <dig> . where applicable, rapamycin was added 8 h after inoculation and adjusted to varying concentrations. 6 ml samples were taken daily for analysis of cell-dry weight, lipid content and fatty acid distribution.

biomass and lipid determination
determination of cellular dry weight occurred by pelleting 2 ml samples , washing cells with ddh2o and freeze drying at −80 °c for 24 h in pre-weighed microtubes. cellular total lipid was obtained by extraction with chloroform and methanol by folch et al.  <cit>  . cell pellets from 12 ml culture were washed with ddh2o twice and disrupted four times by french press  at 2400 bar. a triplicate of 4 ml cell lysate was transferred to glass vials with screw caps and mixed with 6 ml of folch reagent  each. after extraction by shaking at 900 rpm and room temperature for 1 h, 1 ml  <dig> % nacl was added to aid phase separation. samples were vortexed, centrifuged at 1000 g and the chloroform phase was transferred to pre-weighed glass vials. after evaporation of the solvent und a constant stream of dried nitrogen, vials were weighed and lipid content was calculated per dry weight in % g/g.

analysis of fatty acid composition
triplicates of 2 ml culture were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with ddh2o and freeze dried at −80 °c. between  <dig> and 20 mg were used for the fatty acid analysis. fatty acid methyl esters  were obtained by direct conversion of cell biomass by methanol transesterification  <cit> .

fames were analyzed on a gc- <dig> gas chromatograph from shimadzu  with flame ionisation detector and an aoc-20i auto injector . 1 μl sample was applied onto a zb-wax column ) with an initial column temperature of 150 °c . a temperature gradient was applied from 150–240 °c , followed by 6 min maintenance at 240 °c. fatty acids were identified according to retention times of authentic standards.

nile red assay
semi-quantitative estimation of intracellular lipids was done by nile red staining according to sitepu et al.  <cit> . 200 μl of culture sample was adjusted to od600 =  <dig> and transferred to maxisorp f <dig> plates  as  <dig> replicates. after addition of 25 μl dmso, the blank measurement was taken. subsequently, 25 μl of nile red staining solution  were added and nile red fluorescence intensity was measured at 590 nm  on an enspire  <dig> plate reader from perkin elmer . lipids were estimated by correcting fi  by od <dig> 

online od measurements
online od measurements were conducted by measuring real-time backscatter at 525 nm with a cell growth quantifier  using 100 ml ypd in 250 ml shake flask without baffles for 72 h. rapamycin concentration was adjusted to 5 μm 8 h after inoculation. the backscatter signal was calibrated with a manual  <dig> point od <dig> measurement by an hp  <dig> photometer.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis and data visualization was done in r  <cit> . data were fitted to a richards’ growth curve using the grofit package  <cit> . all error bars show standard deviations. stars show significance with p =  <dig>  in comparison to untreated cultures.

assembly of torc-network
previously published genomic and transcriptomic data of t. oleaginosus  <cit>  were searched for torc homologues using sequences from schizosaccharomyces pombe and saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida curvata and cryptococcus neoformans.

RESULTS
effect of rapamycin on nile red fluorescence
cultivation of t. oleaginosus in full ypd medium does not lead to nutrient limitation and is associated with a low accumulation of intracellular lipids. supplementation of this medium with rapamycin  after 8 h cultivation time resulted in significantly higher nile red fluorescence  signal indicating an increased lipid production . the increase of 66% fi/od at 72 h subsequently decreased to 44%  and 40% after 116 h respectively. during cultivation, no decrease in od was observed, indicating that the cell growth was not affected by the applied rapamycin concentrations.fig.  <dig> effect of rapamycin on nile red fluorescence: t. oleaginosus grown in ypd without  and with 20 μm rapamycin  supplementation. at different time points, nile red fluorescence  and od <dig> were measured. the ratio between the latter is plotted on the y axis and is a semiquantitative indicator of lipid content. stars show significance at p =  <dig>  and error bars show standard deviation




it is reported that nile red is a semiquantitative lipid stain  <cit> , as its specific fluorescent signal is dependent on the fatty acid profile, the type of lipid  and the protein content within intracellular lipid bodies.

effect of rapamycin on lipid accumulation
to confirm an increase in lipid yield, a gravimetric biomass and lipid determination was conducted using cells grown in cultures containing between  <dig> and 40 μm rapamycin. the addition of 40 μm rapamycin resulted in a maximal lipid increase of 38% compared to controls. moreover, at 5 μm rapamycin the total biomass production is significantly increased. this data contrasts reports on the effects of rapamycin on algae and bacterial growth, where supplementation of the compound resulted in decreased biomass formation in line with its established cell cycle inhibition effects  <cit> .

due to the expected logarithmic dependency , effects of rapamycin on lipid content  saturate at low concentrations. to confirm the effect of rapamycin on intracellular lipogenesis, we applied a one tailed welch’s t-test between samples in the absence and presence of rapamycin. the null hypothesis of both sample sets being of the same distribution is rejected with p =  <dig>  and a confidence interval of  <dig> –5% g/g increase in the absence and presence of rapamycin.fig.  <dig> effect of rapamycin on lipid content and biomass: total lipid content  and dry biomass  of t. oleaginosus after 72 h of cultivation in ypd are measured with different concentrations of rapamycin supplementation between  <dig> and 40 μm. error bars show standard deviation and the star shows significance at p =  <dig>  in comparison to culture without rapamycin supplementation. the blue line shows a robust logarithmic fit of the lipid content in dependence of rapamycin concentration as described in additional file 1





impact of rapamycin on t. oleaginosus growth kinetics
as our initial data suggested that at 5 μm rapamycin  cell growth was enhanced, we applied a real-time backscatter measurement in order to compare cellular growth in the absence and presence of rapamycin . cell growth could be sufficiently described by a fit to a richards’ curve  <cit> , which allowed extraction of μmax , lambda  and a  values .fig.  <dig> online-od measurement: growth curves of t. oleaginosus without  and with 5 μm rapamycin  obtained by measuring backscatter with an online od system. thin lines  show fit of richards’ growth curves

interestingly, we observed significant differences in the growth parameters of each culture. for the rapamycin treated culture, the maximum growth rate μmax  and the maximum optical density  were elevated compared to controls.

this translates to a change in the maximum growth rate from a nominal  <dig>  to  <dig>  od600/h and an increase in the maximum cell density from od  <dig>   to od  <dig>   respectively. hence, in the presence of 5 μm rapamycin the cell density increased by 19% concomitantly with a 25% lipid increase. these cumulative values translate to a 49% improved space time yield compared to controls in the absence of rapamycin.

the improved growth rate may be attributed to the upregulation of pathways relating to alternative nitrogen sources. a simultaneous assimilation of many different nitrogen sources could be advantageous in a high nutrient environment such as ypd. furthermore, torcs are known to affect cell cycle progression. shortening of the g <dig> phase could lead to an increased growth rate, while sacrificing replication fidelity and long term offspring survival.

fatty acid profile
supplementation of rapamycin caused a non-concentration dependent shift in fatty acid spectrum . under these conditions, a major decrease of c18: <dig> in favor of c18: <dig> fatty acids was observed. additionally, a minor decrease of c16: <dig> and a minor increase in c18: <dig> could be detected. these changes resemble the fatty acid profile obtained by cultivation in nitrogen limiting medium, thereby supporting the notion that rapamycin is at least partially simulating a low nutrient environment to the cells regulatory system. fatty acid spectra show, that the effect of rapamycin saturates at comparatively low concentrations, confirming the fit in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> effect of rapamycin on fatty acid content: profile of the main fatty acids of t. oleaginosus after 72 h of cultivation in minimal n medium  or ypd with different rapamycin concentrations 




in euglena gracilis addition of rapamycin led to an increase in lipid amount but almost no change in fatty acid profile was reported  <cit> . the reason for this appears to be the different mechanism of rapamycin response between this algae and previously identified yeasts or animal cells  <cit> . this observation in this study motivated us to use a bioinformatics approach to investigate the effects of rapamycin on the trichosporon cell signaling network and lipogenesis.

torc-network
a homology-based torc signaling network, including upstream and downstream elements , was assembled. a table of all proposed pathway components can be found in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> torc signaling network in t. oleaginosus: proposed signaling network surrounding torc in t. oleaginosus inferred by homology and assembled using data obtained from s. pombe and s. cerevisiae





the snf1/ampk pathway is highly conserved from yeast to mammals, and homologues of its main components could also be detected in t. oleaginosus. these homologues termed elm <dig>  sak <dig> and tos <dig> are kinases which phosphorylate and activate snf <dig> , which in turn is a central regulator required for energy homeostasis. in s. cerevisiae snf <dig> is mainly responsible for adaption to a glucose limiting environment  <cit> . inactivation of snf <dig> is caused by dephosphorylation initiated by the reg1/glc <dig> complex  <cit> . in a low carbon environment, phosphorylated snf is translocated to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates the transcriptional activator sip <dig>  subsequently, sip <dig> activates the transcription of glucose-repressed genes  <cit> . this process is conserved in ascomycetes s. cerevisiae and s. pombe alike. interestingly, activated snf <dig> also inhibits acc1p, which is responsible for catalysis of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa, a main precursor for the production of fatty acids  <cit> . this indicates a direct link between metabolic signaling under nutrient stress conditions and the regulation of cellular lipid biosynthesis.

furthermore, snf <dig> is reported to inhibit the tsc1/tsc <dig> complex in model yeasts and in mammals. moreover, the tsc1/tsc <dig> complex further integrates signals from other pathways, including the mapk/erk pathway  <cit> , cytokines, hypoxia signals and wnt signaling respectively. more recently, it has been suggested that in yeast, involvement of other factors, especially in reaction to low nutrient content is feasible  <cit> . however, a direct inhibition of torc <dig> by vps <dig>  an essential gene which channels amino acid availability to the tsc1/tsc <dig> complex, has been reported in yeasts and mammals  <cit> .

more specifically, torc <dig> itself receives inputs from rheb over the tsc1/ <dig> axis and directly from the ego complex. in model yeasts this ego is composed of the kinases gtr1/ <dig> and npr2/ <dig> respectively. however in t. oleaginosus, we could not detect homologous of the npr <dig> or ego1-ego <dig> complexes, which indicates that the absence of amino acids in the medium are not sensed via the ego involved signaling. inhibition of the torc <dig> complex by rapamycin occurs via initial formation of an fkh <dig> protein-rapamycin complex , which then binds to torc <dig>  this mechanism is highly conserved throughout the microbial and animal kingdom. expectantly, t. oleaginosus tor <dig> contained the characteristic rapamycin binding motif  <cit> . in nitrogen limitied media, the addition of rapamycin has no effect on t. oleaginosus biomass formation, growth kinetics and intracellular lipid content. this indicates that torc <dig> may already be blocked under nutrient limiting cultivation conditions. consequently, rapamycin addition would have no effects on biomass or lipid formation in the non-conventional yeast t. oleaginosus.

in consensus with data from model yeasts, we could identify homologues components of the torc <dig> complex, namely tor <dig> , kog <dig> and wat <dig> respectively. wat <dig> is a scaffold protein facilitating the connection between tor <dig> and downstream substrates, like ppe <dig> and sch <dig>  <cit> . analogous to model yeasts and mammals the wat <dig> protein in t. oleaginosus mainly contains  <dig> wd <dig> repeats. specifically in mice, wat <dig> was required for torc <dig> but not torc <dig> activity. most interestingly, we could not detect any tco <dig> homologue in t. oleaginosus, which indicates that a component of the torc complexes found in model yeast s. cerevisiae is absent. therefore, the torc <dig> complex of t. oleaginosus more closely resembles the situation reported for s. pombe or the oleaginous yeast r. toruloides. indeed, this resemblances is confirmed by the absence of a second tor gene for torc <dig>  furthermore, we could not identify any avo <dig> or bit <dig> homologues in t. oleaginosus, both of which are non-functional torc2-binding structures  <cit> . transcripts for the torc <dig> component sin <dig> could be identified in different splicing isoform, which is consistent with previous findings in s.cerevisiae  <cit> . notably, in s. cerevisiae, mutation of sin <dig> leads to rapamycin resistance  <cit> . in analogy, the presence of sin <dig> isoforms detected in t. oleaginosus could render the torc <dig> complex resistant to rapamycin.

downstream of primary torc effects, we could identify significant differences between signals in model yeasts and t. oleaginosus affecting autophagy. particularly, genes essential to the autophagy signaling pathway, namely atg <dig>  atg <dig>  atg <dig>  atg <dig> could not found in t. oleaginosus. in this respect, the t. oleaginosus system may resemble the regulatory system of drosophila melanogaster, in which hyperphosphorylated atg <dig> in conjunction with atg <dig> are sufficient to inhibit autophagy. in the model yeast s. cerevisiae the autophagy signaling is by far more complex and therefore may not apply to t. oleaginosus  <cit> . further, individual autophagy related homologues  were found, but the actual signaling pathway appears to differ significantly from other yeast systems.

the other main signaling pathways for regulation of lipid biosynthesis, transcriptional and translational initiation appear to be conserved with high similarity.

in s. cerevisiae, torc <dig> inhibition liberates tap <dig> and sit <dig> from being bound to each other. this in turn activates the downstream transcription factors, gat <dig> and gln <dig>  after gat <dig> and gln <dig> transport to the nucleus, these transcription factors induce the accumulation of lipids. our bioinformatics analysis indicates that a similar mechanism is likely for t. oleaginosus. the highly conserved sch <dig> is homologous to the mammalian s6k, which is responsible for activation of ribosomal protein s <dig> and therefore directly controls translation. by contrast, no homologue to gaf <dig>  which in s. pombe is central for the response to nitrogen stress  <cit> , could be identified. the absence of gaf <dig> therefore may modulate the cell cycle in t. oleaginosus. nonetheless, ppe <dig> homologue a kinase acting within the s. pombe stress response which also affects the cell cycle  <cit>  could be identified.

torc <dig> activation, especially in yeast, remains elusive. in s. pombe, interaction with rhe <dig> is confirmed  <cit> . furthermore, it was reported in mammals, that activation can be achieved by growth factors . furthermore, ribosomal association of the complex suggests its activation by nutrients. especially the latter is also likely for yeast  <cit> , considering the effect on growth in s. pombe  <cit> . in t. oleaginosus however, little can be reported about the effects of downstream torc <dig> elements due to the absence of detailed cell biology studies.

active torc <dig> activates fkh1/ <dig> in s. cerevisiae , which affects autophagy related genes, life span and stress response  <cit> . torc <dig> as well as the highly conserved kinase ksg <dig> activate gad <dig> by phosphorylation  <cit> . the subsequent cellular effects strongly depend on the organism. for s. cerevisiae, this impacts on actin organization and cell wall synthesis, whereas for c. elegans mainly lipid metabolism and growth are affected. for the related and well described yeast, s. pombe, changes in amino acid uptake and general changes in stress response are described  <cit> . lack of rho/rac homologues indicates a strong difference in the regulation of actin organization from s. pombe.


a confirmed element of torc <dig> is pkc activation, as was described for the closely related and pathogenic cryptococcus curvatus. pkc itself is involved in regulation of spingholipid biosynthesis, which impacts the structural integrity of the cell wall  <cit> . most recently, the gata transcription factor gaf <dig> was reported to be responsible for sexual development in yeast and upregulation of amino acid transporters  <cit> . it is activated as response to nitrogen stress about  <dig> to 120 min after the onset of nitrogen stress. therefore it can be hypothesized that it is part of a first, reversible response to nutrient stress. persisting lack of nitrogen would then trigger the second, delayed phase which includes elevated mating in s.pombe.

two factors indicate, that the observed effects are not due to rapamycin involvement with torc2: rapamycin resistance of torc <dig> could be structurally substantiated by avo <dig> , which wraps around the fkpb-binding domain of tor1/ <dig>  <cit> . prolonged exposure of certain mammalian cell types to rapamycin showed inhibited assembly of torc <dig>  <cit> , however this was not observed in unicellular organisms  <cit>  and therefore appears unlikely for t. oleaginosus. secondly, no obvious differences in cell morphology were observed using microscopy  and facs , indicating that for t. oleaginosus, rapamycin does not impact on cytoskeleton and actin organization, which are commonly affected by torc <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, lipogenesis could be induced in an oleaginous yeast without compromising on growth, resulting in a  <dig>  fold increase in total lipid yield. we observed an increase in growth as well as lipid content in the absence of nutrient limitation, using ypd as model substrate with high nutrient content. torc <dig> in trichosporon oleaginosus can be inhibited by rapamycin, impacting on growth characteristics and lipid accumulation. however, considering a lack of reduction in growth and comparatively minor increases in lipid accumulation, inactivation of torc <dig> is not sufficient to induce a cell state resembling nitrogen starvation.

it is possible, that t. oleaginosus either relies on torc <dig> inhibition, requires additive signals of both complexes or employs another unknown pathway for full activation of nitrogen stress response and associated lipid accumulation. however, torc <dig> regulation of lipid synthesis and its strong involvement in the upregulation of aminoacid transporters  <cit> , one of the defining features of lipid accumulation in t. oleaginosus, make torc <dig> involvement in nutrient limitation response in this yeast likely.

proteomic and transcriptomic approaches are excellent tools for elucidating how rapamycin impacts on t. oleaginosus physiology. comparing these data with previously obtained information about transcriptomic changes  <cit>  in the presence of nitrogen stress will allow for pinpointing more clearly the relevance of torc <dig> for lipid accumulation. using a metabolomic strategy is a promising approach for a more in-depth study of key intermediates, such as glutamine and glutamate as components of central nitrogen metabolism.
