BACKGROUND
based on their chromatin morphology, fully-grown antral oocytes may be classified into two distinct types: surrounded nucleolus  oocytes, that present a ring of hoechst-positive chromatin around the nucleolus and non-surrounded nucleolus  oocytes, that lack this ring and have a more widespread chromatin  <cit> . these two types of antral oocytes have been described in most of the mammals studied, including mouse  <cit> , cow  <cit> , monkeys  <cit> , pigs  <cit> , rats  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . in the mouse and bovine, the two chromatin organizations reflect distinct developmental competence. when matured in vitro to metaphase ii  and fertilised, sn oocytes may reach the blastocyst stage  <cit>  and complete development to the birth of new individuals  <cit> , whereas nsn oocytes cease development at the 2-cell stage  <cit> .

this protocol of antral oocyte classification, though allowing the recognition of gametes that are potentially developmentally competent or incompetent, has several limitations. first, to allow fluorochrome loading and microscope observation, it requires that oocytes are isolated from its companion cumulus cells , hence hampering the quality of the following culture steps to the mii stage. furthermore, although the use of the supravital fluorochrome hoechst  <dig> and the subsequent steps of classification under uv light do not alter significantly the oocytes developmental competence  <cit> , for obvious reasons the employment of this dna-binding molecule is a strong limitation and is not advisable, outside the laboratory routine with model animals, for the selection of oocytes of domestic species or of humans.

the use of non-invasive markers that permit the classification of sn and nsn oocytes would clearly be more appropriate. to this regard, the cumulus cells  that envelope fully-grown antral and ovulated oocytes have been considered as putative source of non-invasive molecular markers of the oocyte developmental competence and a number of studies have revealed a correlation between ccs gene expression and embryo quality . in all these studies, the oocyte developmental competence was inferred a posteriori, by observing the quality of preimplantation embryos obtained and/or the final pregnancy outcome.

the objective of this investigation is the identification of marker transcripts that would allow the non-invasive selection of nsn and sn oocytes. to this regard, we isolated ccs from fully-grown antral mouse oocytes of known developmental incompetence  or competence  and compared by microarrays their whole transcriptome and, by quantitative real-time pcr , the expression profile of cc-related genes . we described a group of regulated genes that represent the molecular signature of ccs associated either with developmentally incompetent  or competent  antral oocytes.

RESULTS
the microarray analysis identified a group of differentially expressed genes as putative markers of the oocyte developmental competence
a strong point of the model study adopted here is that we knew in advance the developmental capability of the antral oocytes from which we isolated the ccs, thus allowing, for the first time, a direct correlation of the transcriptome of the ccs with the oocyte quality.

out of  <dig> probes  analysed with an illumina microarray chip, after setting a fold-change cut-off of >  <dig>  and a p-value of <  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the comparison between nsn-ccs vs. sn-ccs; of these,  <dig> were down-regulated and only one  was up-regulated . then, to verify whether this down-regulated transcriptional profile was a feature of the nsn-ccs, we lowered the fold-change cut-off to >  <dig> , maintaining a p-value of <  <dig> . a total of  <dig> genes were found differentially expressed in the comparison between nsn-ccs vs. sn-ccs . none of these genes were expressed exclusively in one of the two types of ccs and, again, the great majority  were down-regulated in nsn-ccs, except for  <dig> genes that were up-regulated, with amh still being the most highly up-regulated gene.

next, on the differentially expressed genes we performed both a bioinformatic analysis and a bibliographic search of genes known for their association with the ovarian follicle function. a gene ontology  enrichment analysis, using the tool provided by the data mining and bioinformatics software orange , allowed the identification of  <dig> major biological processes  comprising  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes , the remaining  <dig> being sequences whose function is yet unidentified. thirty per cent of these genes, all down-regulated, were assigned to the ‘signal transduction’ biological process; the only  <dig> up-regulated genes were attributed to ‘nucleic acid metabolism’ , ‘cell death’ , ‘cell differentiation’  and ‘reproduction’ .

then, to determine whether and how individual genes are interrelated or interact with each other and to search for biological pathways and the inter-relationships between network genes, with orange we interrogated the mesh and string repositories. this analysis generated a single broad network made of  <dig> genes  in which the gene pttg <dig>  isolated from developmentally incompetent  or competent  oocytes.  major biological processes and functions found when comparing the transcription profile of nsn-ccs vs. sn-ccs.  number of up- and down-regulated genes in each of these processes.

 tumor-transforming gene 1) stood out with the highest number of neighbours, as shown in additional file  <dig>  where pttg <dig> is related to its two more proximal neighbours. interestingly, pttg <dig> emerged as a regulated gene also in a previous microarray study of cow follicles. as in our nsn-ccs, pttg <dig> was down-regulated in ccs isolated from immature vs. mature cow follicles  <cit> , indicating that its down-regulation may be correlated with a lower degree of maturity of the follicle enclosing nsn oocytes  <cit> . the significance and role of this gene network within the biology of the ccs is, at this stage, unknown, although its identification is a prerequisite towards more functional studies that will improve our limited knowledge of both genes and associated pathways in force in these cells.

finally, we searched the public database pubmed for links between a number of mesh terms correlated with the ovarian function  and the  <dig> differentially expressed genes. of these,  <dig> could not be found in the interrogated database, whereas the remaining majority of  <dig> scored at least one result and  <dig> obtained the highest score , with amh and has <dig> at the top of the list. these results highlight the follicle-related nature of this gene list and its possible future use to further our understanding of the interactions between the female gamete and its associated ccs.

cumulus cell-related genes are differentially expressed in nsn-ccs compared to sn-ccs
among the differentially expressed genes brought out by our microarray analysis, we focused on two, amh and has <dig>  both included as part of the ‘reproduction’ biological process  and known players of the ccs biology . the amh  gene, whose protein inhibits the stimulatory effect of fsh  on follicle growth  <cit> , was the most up-regulated in our experiments with a  <dig> -fold higher expression in ccs of developmentally incompetent  compared to that of developmentally competent  oocytes. the has <dig>  gene, a cc-related transcript implicated in the secretion of hyaluronic acid, was  <dig> -fold down-regulated in nsn-ccs vs. sn-ccs; its expression level, together with that of other cc-related transcripts, is directly correlated to bad preimplantation development and pregnancy outcome in human  <cit>  and in cow  <cit> .

following, to confirm our microarrays results, we analysed by qrt-pcr the profile of expression of amh and has2; also, we extended this analysis to three more cc-related genes  previously shown to play a critical role during the latest phases of oocyte maturation and whose expression pattern was also correlated to the developmental outcome: ptx <dig> , tnfaip <dig>  and ptgs <dig> , associated with the stabilisation of the matrix at the time of cumulus expansion  <cit> .

when comparing nsn-ccs vs. sn-ccs, has <dig> resulted the most down-regulated , confirming the microarray results; followed by tnfaip <dig> ; ptx <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  . these results show that the profile of expression of mouse has <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  ptx <dig> and ptgs <dig> resembles that described earlier in human and cow ccs, i.e., lower in developmentally incompetent vs. competent oocytes  <cit> . the down-regulation of all these transcripts in nsn-ccs correlates with the poor quality of the enclosed oocyte  <cit>  and is indicative of an overall immaturity/incompetence of these antral follicles. the qrt-pcr of the amh transcript substantiated the microarrays data

 showing an even higher average  up-regulation in nsn-ccs compared to sn-ccs  . this differential expression was further confirmed at the protein level. imunofluorescence detection of the amh protein revealed that nsn-ccs display very bright fluorescence, whereas sn-ccs show a faint signal .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the classification of mouse antral oocytes, based on their chromatin organisation into developmentally competent  and incompetent , allowed the separation of their surrounding ccs into two distinct groups. for the first time, the microarray-based evaluation of their transcriptome highlighted a similar transcriptional activity, with the exception of  <dig> genes,  <dig> % of which are down-regulated in nsn oocytes. the differential gene expression between the two types of ccs includes a group of four down-regulated cc-related  and one up-regulated  gene in nsn-ccs compared to sn-ccs. when analysed by qrt-pcr, amh is the most differentially expressed with an average 4-fold higher expression in ccs associated with nsn oocytes, demonstrating its robustness as a further non-invasive diagnostic marker for the selection of developmentally competent or incompetent mouse antral oocytes. this result assumes a noteworthy significance at the light of a very recent study showing that human amh is highly expressed in ccs of preovulatory follicles containing premature or atretic oocytes  <cit> . it would be extremely interesting, for the aim we are pursuing of identifying non-invasive markers of developmental competence, to correlate the expression of this gene with the chromatin configuration in these human oocytes.

overall, the regulated nature of the identified group of genes may represent the molecular signature of ccs associated either with developmentally incompetent or competent oocytes. hence, our data might represent a valuable resource for enabling the development of novel non-invasive molecular tools for the assessment of oocyte quality and for the detailed investigation of the complex bi-directional interactions occurring between ccs and oocytes.
