BACKGROUND
there are increasing numbers of patients around the world with peripheral arterial disease   <cit> . promotion of collateral vessel formation and angiogenesis in such patients is an important therapeutic strategy to minimize tissue injury associated with severe ischemia. circulating endothelial progenitor cells  have been discovered in peripheral blood and shown to participate in postnatal neovascularization after mobilization from bone marrow   <cit> . based upon those discoveries, we conducted therapeutic angiogenesis using autologous bm-derived mononuclear cell  implantation  into the ischemic muscles in patients with critical limb ischemia  <cit> . however, patients with very severe pad undergoing chronic hemodialysis or uncontrolled diabetes had poor responses to the tact procedure  <cit> . moreover, recent data indicate that patients with severe ischemic heart disease and/or multiple coronary risk factors have a reduced number of circulating epcs, diminished angiogenic function of their epcs and a poor response to angiogenic cell therapy  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to discover an alternative source of stem/progenitor cells for therapeutic angiogenesis.

recently, novel embryonic stem  cell-like pluripotent stem cells were generated from mouse skin fibroblasts by introduction of four transcriptional factors  <cit> . termed induced pluripotent stem  cells, they could be used repetitively and were capable of differentiating into various kinds of cells as needed <cit> . recently, it was reported that various cardiovascular cells could be directionally induced from mouse and human ips cell-derived fetal liver kinase- <dig> positive  cells in vitro  <cit> . thus, ips cells open new possibilities for cell-based regenerative medicine that will circumvent the ethical controversies and immune-related problems associated with es cells. here, we investigated whether implantation of ips-derived flk-1+ cells could augment the process of ischemia-induced angiogenesis in vivo.

RESULTS
differentiation of ips cells to flk-1+ cells
undifferentiated ips cells were cultured on collagen iv-coated dishes with dm as described previously  <cit> . firstly, we assessed the time course of flk-1+ cell appearance by fluorescence-activated cell sorter . flk-1+ cells appeared after  <dig>  days of culture and peaked on day  <dig>  . the average frequencies of flk-1+ cells were  <dig> % , 27% ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , confirming a previous report  <cit> . based on these findings, we sorted flk-1+ cells by magnetic-activated cell sorting  at day  <dig>  of differentiation in the present study. facs analysis of macs-sorted positive through cells showed that more than 99% of these cells were positive for flk- <dig> . we also found that macs-purified flk- <dig> positive cells were sorted in not only nanog-gfp positive population but also nanog-gfp negative cell population .

we also tried to characterize the flk1+ cells by facs analysis. gated flk1+ cells showed cd11b negative, cd <dig> negative, cd <dig> negative, ve-cadherin negative, e-cadherin negative, cd <dig> negative or cd <dig> negative . cd <dig> positive cells accounted for  <dig> % of gated flk1+ cells, cxcr <dig> positive cells for  <dig> %, sca- <dig> positive cells for  <dig> %, ssea- <dig> positive cells for  <dig> % and c-kit positive cells for  <dig> %. flk1+ cells are considered as relatively immature and still have an aspect as heterogeneous stem cells at the upstream position.

we confirmed the expression of undifferentiated markers such as nanog and oct3/ <dig> on differentiation at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by rt-pcr . undifferentiated ips cells markers, nanog and oct3/ <dig>  were strongly expressed in early phase and started to gradually decrease with differentiation. we also observed the transient expression of c-myc.

augmentation of ischemia-induced angiogenesis by flk-1+ cells derived from ips cells
we examined whether in vivo implantation of flk-1+ cells derived from ips cells could augment ischemia-induced angiogenesis using a mouse model of hind limb ischemia. ksn athymic nude mice underwent surgical induction of unilateral hind limb ischemia. sorted flk-1+ cells  or control pbs were injected into adductor muscles in the ischemic limb at postoperative day  <dig> . all mice survived from surgery and appeared healthy during the follow-up period. body weight and blood pressure did not differ among the groups. we show the representative ldbf images of hind limb blood flow of recipient mice just after the surgery and at the different time points after surgery . in control mice, hind limb perfusion fell precipitously after surgery, increased to  <dig> - 30% of the nonischemic limb by day  <dig>  and increased to 40-50% of the nonischemic limb by day  <dig> . however, mice transplanted with flk-1+ cells showed significant increases in hind limb blood relative to control at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after hind limb surgery . we next assessed dose-dependency of cell transplantation at  <dig> days after surgery. smaller doses of cells  also yielded improvements in blood perfusion . however, mice treated with  <dig> Ã—  <dig> cells did not achieve a significant improvement in blood perfusion in the ischemic limb compared to control mice .

implanted flk-1+ cells augmented the expression of vegf in ischemic tissues
we investigated whether implantation of flk-1+ cells would up-regulate vegf mrna expression in ischemic hind limb tissues in chronological order. at postoperative days  <dig> and  <dig>  vegf mrna expression increased significantly in mice transplanted with flk-1+ cells  compared to that of control mice . smaller doses of cells  also slightly increased vegf mrna expression. at day  <dig>  there was no significant difference between the groups. however, the dose-dependency for expression of vegf mrna was apparent.

we next examined the synthesis of basic fgf, hgf and igf in ischemic muscle after cell transplantation by real-time pcr. there were no significant difference in these mrna levels between mice transplanted with flk-1+ cells and control mice .

tracing flk-1+ cells in vitro and at chronic phase in vivo
we examined whether flk-1+ cells could be incorporated into the vascular network in vitro. figure 6a shows representative photographs of pkh26-labeled flk-1+ ips cells and huvecs after  <dig> hours of co-culture on a matrigel. incorporation of flk-1+ ips cells  into the network structures was confirmed.

using pkh26-labeled flk1+ cells, we examined whether in vivo implanted flk-1+ cells survived and differentiated into vascular endothelial cells in ischemic tissues . transplanted pkh26-positive cells were found in the ischemic area even at postoperative day  <dig>  immunofluorescence histology revealed that some of the pkh26-positive cells were co-stained with the endothelial cell marker cd <dig> . these results indicated that implanted flk-1+ cells contributed to vascular structure formation at postoperative day  <dig>  we could not detect any tumors in the mice transplanted with flk-1+  cells through the  <dig> days after transplantation .

discussion
the present study provides evidence that implantation of flk-1+ cells differentiated from mouse ips cells promote angiogenesis in a well-established hind limb ischemia model. in the model, no tumors were observed. mice transplanted with these cells displayed rapid recovery of limb blood perfusion, which was accompanied by a rapid increase in vegf mrna levels in the ischemic tissues.

recently, preclinical studies had validated the concept of "cell therapy for ischemic disease" using stem/progenitor cells to repair and regenerate vascular cells in patients with severe ischemic cardiovascular disease  <cit> . however, collection of somatic stem cells in sufficient numbers for cell therapy is difficult and may require invasive procedures such as bone marrow aspiration or resection of the liver or pancreas. additionally, problems of utilizing somatic stem cell is that  the number of somatic stem cell is very limited in general,  the implanted progenitor cells have low functions of mobilization capacity from bone marrow as well as angiogenic potentials in patients with multiple risk factors for arteriosclerosis  <cit> . on the other hand, ips cells have an unlimited ability for self-renewal and expansion  <cit> . thus, it might be possible to collect large numbers of cells following cultivation in vitro while maintaining its undifferentiated phenotype. ips cells can also be differentiated into various kinds of cells as needed  <cit> . in addition, autologous ips cells can circumvent the ethical controversy associated with es cell and reduce immune-related problems  <cit> . thus, ips cells may have superiority for vascular regenerative medicine compared to es cells and somatic stem/progenitor cells.

therapeutic angiogenesis is likely mediated by multiple angiogenic cytokines released from implanted cells and host muscle tissues such as vegf, bfgf and hgf rather than by direct differentiation of transplanted cells into mature endothelial cells  <cit> . consistent with this notion, our study showed that implanted flk-1+ cells generated from ips cells rapidly augmented expression of vegf in ischemic tissues. on the other hand, the expression of bfgf, hgf or igf was not affected in this study. enhanced vegf activity would directly affect hind limb blood flow.

recently, narazaki and coworkers showed that flk-1+ cells derived from mouse ips cells could differentiate into both endothelial and mural cells and reproduce the vascular regeneration process  <cit> . in the present study, we confirmed incorporation of flk-1+ cells generated from ips cells into vascular network structures in vitro. in addition, it was shown that implanted flk-1+ cells were successfully incorporated into capillary networks in the ischemic tissues. therefore, flk-1+ cells generated from ips cells might stimulate angiogenesis not only by a paracrine action of cytokines but also by a direct side supply of endothelial cells. these findings are encouraging since it is possible that implantation of ips cell-derived flk-1+ cells could construct de novo vessels in ischemic tissues, consistent with postnatal vasculogenesis. further studies will be needed to clarify the differentiation capacity of these cells.

recently, two studies reported the usefulness of flk-1+ cells for promoting angiogenesis in vivo  <cit> . transplantation of human cord blood-derived flk-1+/cd34+ cells could salvage ischemic tissue in severe combined immune deficiency mice  <cit> . when flk-1+ cells generated from es cells were directly injected into the heart, significant improvement in cardiac function was observed in doxorubicin induced cardiomyopathy, and this was accompanied by an increase in capillary density  <cit> .

we have some limitations in this study. firstly with regard to the unexpected lack of difference in vegf expression in day  <dig>  self-healing and supplementary effect by ips may spontaneously attenuate around  <dig> days after transplantation. one study showed that double immunolabeling for brdu and cd- <dig> in ischemic versus normal murine hindlimbs established that endothelial cell proliferation peaks at  <dig> d ; proliferative activity is then subsequently reduced at days  <dig> and  <dig> <cit> . however, detailed biochemical and cellular studies are required to better understand the underlying mechanism of these conditions.

secondly, the ksn nude mice were used for this study to avoid immunological rejection of the injected ips cells, because the genetic background of the mefs for ips generation in this study was 75% dba,  <dig> % c57bl/ <dig> and  <dig> % 129s <dig>  <cit> . ksn nude mice were mostly dead within three month by intestinal infections. we could not detect formation of any tumors in the mice transplanted flk-1+ cells at least until post-operative day  <dig>  because more than 99% of macs-sorted cells were flk1+, the contamination of undifferentiated cells into injected cells was very rare. the present study indicated the possibility of therapeutic use of ips cells. however, we always need very careful observation for tumor formation in any transplantation studies using ips cells in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, direct local implantation of mouse ips cell-derived flk-1+ cells has augmented ischemia-induced angiogenesis in a mouse model. this suggests that ips cells would be a potential candidate for use in therapeutic angiogenesis.
