BACKGROUND
corneal avascularity is necessary for the preservation of corneal transparency and optimal vision  <cit> . there is a dynamic balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors in the cornea that plays a key role in maintaining avascularity. under normal physiologic conditions, the process of angiogenesis is well controlled, reflecting a perfect balance of endogenous growth factors and suppressors. however, in the condition of persistent hypoxia, chronic inflammation, injury and hereditary stem cell deficiency, the pro-angiogenic growth factors outnumber angiogenesis inhibitors, the balance shifts in favor of angiogenesis, and then the corneal angiogenic privilege could be destroyed  <cit> . although new blood vessel growth in response to ischemic conditions is to repair the injury, pathologic corneal neovascularization  and hyperpermeability can cause decreased vision and failure of transplantation. conv is a sight-threatening condition, which is also a challenge for ophthalmologists. the inhibitory effects of steroids, cyclosporine, thalidomide, photodynamictherapy, conjunctival limbal allograft and fine needle diathermy for conv vary in clinical and experimental use  <cit> . they are not always effective, sometimes may induce complications.

angiogenesis, the process by which new vessels sprout from pre-existing vasculature, has become the subject of intense research in recent years and therapies that directly target key factors of neovascular formation are promising. among the angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor  plays an important role in both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increases permeability across the vessels. extensive research studies focus on the vegf families and receptors  <cit> . given that several studies have demonstrated that the secretion and receptor expression of vegf were increased during the neovascularization of the cornea, specific molecules have been targeted for drug development and have drawn much attention recently  <cit> . the targeted inhibition of vegf provides ophthalmologists with an angiogenesis-specific pharmacological approach to treating conv and deserves to be evaluated. there are many vegf inhibitors which are in advanced clinical use for ocular neovascularization, such as lucentis, macugen and bevacizumab/avastin. administration of these drugs in conv has been associated with promising results  <cit> .

in our previous work, we screened out a novel anti-vegf antibody from a natural human scfv phage library which was constructed in our lab. then, the recombinant vector to express the full antibody was constructed and transfected into mammalian cells. the full igg, named as fd <dig>  was prepared for further studies. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the pharmacological characteristics and efficacy of fd <dig> both in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
the predicted binding mode of fd <dig> was similar to bevacizumab
using antibody phage display library, we obtained a novel anti-vegfa antibody, named as fd <dig>  after sequencing, the amino acid residues of the variable region in fd <dig> were determined as shown in figure 1a. using computer-guided homology modeling method, the stable 3-d structure of fd <dig> variable region was constructed and shown in figure 1b. based on the crystal structure of vegfa, the complex structure of vegfa and fd <dig> was constructed and optimized  using computer-guided molecular docking method. using interactive graphics and the hard-sphere approximation for atoms, we found that the fd <dig> variable region was fitted into the binding site of vegfa which identified by bevacizumab. the binding mode of fd <dig>  e.g. binding energy and epitope, was analyzed and shown in table  <dig>  which showed that the binding mode between fd <dig> and vegf was similar to bevacizumab and vegf.

fd <dig> possessed similar or even higher affinity than bevacizumab
elisa assay was performed to determine the antigen-binding specificity of fd <dig>  as shown in figure 2a, it was shown that both bevacizumab and fd <dig> could bind to vegf on a dose-dependent manner. in addition, the ec <dig> of fd <dig> was about  <dig>  μg/ml while that of bevacizumab was  <dig>  μg/ml, suggesting that fd <dig> might possess stronger binding ability than bevacizumab . further experiments indicated the interacting kinetics of two mabs to bind to vegf , displaying approximately 2-fold higher affinity of fd <dig> than bevacizumab  due to its slower dissociation rate; besides, the inhibitory ability of fd <dig> against the vegf-induced cell proliferation in huvec was identified. the ic <dig> value of fd <dig> was approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml, indicating its somewhat better antiangiogenic activity of fd <dig> than bevacizumab  .

fd <dig> inhibited in vivo neovascularization in conv
alkali-induced conv model is a simple model system for the study of neovascularization. after the alkali-soaked filter paper was removed from the cornea, the central cornea appeared opaque with a clear margin. after modeling, vessels began sprouting into the cornea from the limbus. it was demonstrated that the subconjunctival administration of fd <dig>  bevacizumab and dexamethasone could all significantly inhibit conv in naoh cauterized rats compared with the control group  ; furthermore, compared with bevacizumab, fd <dig> was a little more effective on inhibiting conv to reduce the length and area of the corneal neovasculature at day  <dig> and day  <dig> . however, since day  <dig>  there was no obvious difference between the two groups . meanwhile, the two antibodies were less effective than dexamethasone . typical he staining images of the rats’ conv were shown in figure  <dig>  which also displayed weaker vascularization in the fd <dig> group, bevacizumab group and dexamethasone group contrasting to that in the control group .

fd <dig> downregulated the expression of neovascularization-related molecules in the cornea
according to western blot analysis, the subconjunctival administration of fd <dig> or bevacizumab significantly decreased the protein expression of vegf, vegfr- <dig>  vegfr- <dig>  mmp- <dig> and icam- <dig>  while  <dig> % nacl treated group and solvent group displayed visibly high expression of the above factors in the cornea . it might be the possible mechanism of fd006’s inhibitory ability against neovascularization in vivo, indicating that fd <dig> might be a favorable anti-angiogenic candidate drug.

discussion
the normal cornea is an avascular structure. the formation of neovascularization may be a physiological response to various stimuli; however, the chronic and persistent upregulation of pro-angiogenic factors may result in pathological conv, which can lead to blindness. for it was reported that vegf is required for inflammatory neovascularization and a crucial endogenous corneal angiogenic factor, vegf was confirmed as the key target for blocking the cascade of neovascular formation  <cit> . vegf is a vascular endothelial cell mitogen and one of the key regulators of angiogenesis in various physiological and pathological conditions  <cit> . by binding to vegfr, vegf triggers its tyrosine phosphorylation and induces a signaling cascade that promotes growth, survival, migration, differentiation of endothelia cells as well as mobilizing endothelial progenitor cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral circulation  <cit> . the angiogenic activity of vegf is believed to be regulated by two high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, vegfr- <dig>  and vegfr- <dig> , which is reported to be the dominant angiogenic activity receptor of vegf. although the complications of dexamethasone such as cataract and secondary glaucoma have limited its clinical use, it is still a powerful anti-vegf agent; bevacizumab is also considered as an effective anti-vegf agent that can bind to soluble vegf, preventing receptor binding  <cit> .

we discovered that the protein expression of icam- <dig> and mmp- <dig> was significantly higher in the control groups than in the other groups. fd <dig> reduced the expression of icam- <dig> and mmp- <dig> compared with the control groups . icam- <dig>  is one of cell surface glycoproteins that are typically expressed on endothelial cells. icams may play a critical role in regulating leukocyte migration and accumulation at sites of inflammation, thus generating inflammatory response and damage to tissue  <cit> . corneal fibroblasts expressed icam- <dig> and vcam- <dig> when activated with il- <dig> and tnf-alpha  <cit> . luo et al. discovered that vegf and b-fgf can facilitate the expression of icam- <dig>  <cit> . therefore we inferred that the expression level of icam- <dig> was lower in fd <dig> group because there may be a feedback reaction where the decreased vegf expression influences the release of icam- <dig> after fd <dig> blocked the vegf signaling.

mmps play indispensable roles in the formation of conv and are one of the most potent proangiogenic factors. mmp- <dig>  also known as gelatin b, plays an important role in degrading the ecm and basement membrane during organizational restructuring and angiogenesis. mmps can promote the migration of endothelial cells by destroying connections between the cells and the extracellular matrix  <cit> . particularly, the synergistic actions of mmps and vegf have been discovered in angiogenesis, and studies have already demonstrated that vegf and mmps influence each other during angiogenesis. mmp can enhance vegf release and modulate vegf expression  <cit> . additionally, vegf increases the release of the mmps and decreases the release of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, whereas mmps activate the angiogenic activity of vegf. we believe that, among icam- <dig>  mmp- <dig> and vegf, there is a cascade of chain reactions that influence each other. however, our hypotheses require further investigation.

in this study, we screened and predicted the novel anti-vegf monoclonal antibody fd <dig> to have similar affinity to bevacizumab . further experiments testified that both bevacizumab and fd <dig> could bind to vegf specifically on a dose-dependent manner; meanwhile, fd <dig> showed somewhat stronger affinity to bind vegf than bevacizumab by both elisa  and binding kinetics assays  mainly because of its slower dissociation rate . in principle, the higher affinity of anti-vegf means higher efficiency to neutralize vegf; furthermore, fd <dig> seemed to have a better inhibitory effect on the vegf-induced proliferation of huvec than bevacizumab, which was consistent with antigen binding assays .

the alkali burn-induced conv model has been widely used to investigate the mechanism of corneal neovascular formation. here, this method also induced conv successfully. several studies reported that bevacizumab was more effective via subconjunctival administration for conv compared with via topical eye drops  <cit> , therefore in this study fd <dig> was subconjunctivally injected in alkali-burn induced corneal neovascularizaiton to evaluate its biological properties in vivo. it was demonstrated that fd <dig> could inhibit corneal neovascular formation. particularly, during the early stage after alkali burn, it seemed a little better than bevacizumab . the reason might be the higher ability of fd <dig> to bind vegf. however, at the late stages, fd <dig> and bevacizumab had an equal therapeutic effect on inhibiting conv. besides, fd <dig> significantly decreased the expression of vegf, vegfr- <dig>  vegfr- <dig>  icam- <dig>  and mmp- <dig> in cornea compared with the control group , explaining partially why fd <dig> had satisfactory anti-neovascularization effect.

CONCLUSIONS
this study displayed the pharmacological characteristics of fd <dig>  which were similar or a little superior to bevacizumab, such as higher affinity, better anti-neovascularization function in vitro and in vivo, indicating that fd <dig> might be a promising agent in the treatment of human conv in the future.
