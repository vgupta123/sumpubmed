BACKGROUND
grapevine  is one of the most valuable horticultural crops in the world. many of the widely cultivated varieties are very ancient genotypes that have been vegetatively multiplied for centuries and spread worldwide. in many places the same genotypes were re-named leading to synonyms  as well as homonyms . currently, there is a large but imprecise number of grapevine varieties in the world : this number could likely be reduced once all varieties are properly genotyped and compared.

when genetic identification is taken into account, two goals have to be fulfilled: i) the availability of a large enough number of polymorphic markers; and ii) the existence of public genotype databases allowing for comparisons with previously characterized genotypes. markers should provide a high discrimination power and yield reproducible genotype data among different laboratories and detection platforms as well as over time. markers should also be stable, meaning that they produce consistent and repeatable results after repeated propagation of the varieties. this is especially important in the case of grapevine where many varieties have been under cultivation for centuries, and some molecular markers have been shown not to be fully stable in certain old varieties, due to somatic mutation  <cit> . in addition, genotyping methodologies should be easily accessible at low cost and comparable and genotype data should be easily stored in databases and publicly accessed.

grapevine genotyping is currently based on microsatellite markers or simple sequence repeats , which have been very useful not only for genetic identification  <cit>  but also for parentage analysis  <cit> . these markers have some relevant advantages for research such as their co-dominance, multi-allelism and high levels of polymorphism  <cit> . however, there are a number of disadvantages in using ssr markers. the most important problem is related to allele binning: the process that converts raw allele lengths into allele classes normally expressed by integer numbers  <cit> . problems stemming from allele miscalling derive in part from the wide use of ssr based on di-nucleotide repeats and the frequent addition of one adenine nucleotide by the dna polymerase, which gives rise to alleles very close in size and difficult to distinguish. this problem can be partially solved with the use of ssr with core repeats three to five nucleotides long such as those recently developed, based on the information provided by the whole genome sequence  <cit> . however, even if longer repeat length markers are used, it is also important to take into account the fact that different analytical systems  could produce different allele sizes and consequently different bins, increasing the hardship of comparing genotype tables produced by different laboratories. to overcome these difficulties, standardization and exchange of information concerning grapevine genetic resources using reference varieties for certain microsatellite markers and alleles have been proposed  <cit>  and discussed within european projects such as genres  <dig> and grapegen <dig>  aiming at integrating genotypic information obtained by different laboratories.

in recent years, numerous sequencing projects have generated an abundance of sequence information and nucleotide polymorphisms. these belong to two basic types: single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertions-deletions of different lengths . among them, snp markers have the advantage that they are mostly bi-allelic and are very frequent in genomes. although snp polymorphism information content  is lower than that of ssr markers, tens, hundreds or even thousands snp can be easily used when required. snp are highly reproducible among laboratories and detection techniques, since the different alleles are not distinguished on the basis of their size but on the basis of the nucleotide present at a given position. all these features and their unlimited availability are making snp the markers of choice for the development of identification panels in many animal and plant species  <cit> .

in this work, we characterized the genetic features of  <dig> snp to select a panel of  <dig> markers suitable for cultivar identification in grapevine. we show here that the panel has a similar discrimination power as a set of  <dig> ssr markers and can represent a very robust genetic identification system, problem-free of allele miscalling among laboratories or detection technologies. we also demonstrate that markers have a very low genotyping error rate, a low rate of appearance of new mutations when compared to ssr, and are amenable for easy storage in genotype databases. given the state of revision and integration of genetic resources in grapevine, our snp panel may become a rapid tool for genetic identification and genotype calling in the crop.

RESULTS
single nucleotide polymorphisms  detection
identification of snp markers in the grapevine genome was carried out based on a re-sequencing strategy in a selected sample of grapevine genotypes as previously described  <cit> . the sample was chosen to include non-related wine and table grape cultivars of ancient origin as well as wild accessions. based on the available information, cultivars corresponded to different genetic groups  <cit>  and had chlorotypes belonging to the four major types described in grapevine  <cit> . a total of  <dig> snp markers were identified in this way to which we added  <dig> snp validated at csiro across a range of genotypes. for the final  <dig> snp we developed genotyping strategies based on snplex™. a first step to analyze the quality of these polymorphisms in grapevine and to estimate their allele frequencies was to genotype a sample of  <dig> accessions of grapevine including wine and table grape varieties as well as wild accessions . this approach allowed for discarding  <dig> snp that did not worked in the analyses and  <dig> that, although initially identified as polymorphic in sequence comparisons, either behaved as monomorphic in the analyzed sample or were genotyped as heterozygous in 100% of the samples suggesting the existence of duplicated loci. as a result only  <dig> snp markers were considered for further analyses .

genomic location of snp markers
genotyping of four grapevine segregating progeny populations with the seven snplex™ sets allowed us to genetically map most of the  <dig> polymorphic snp, which were heterozygous in one or both parents in at least one of the progeny populations . on average, the use of the seven snplex™ sets allowed for including  <dig> markers in the consensus map of any given mapping population:  <dig> for each progenitor  and  <dig> common markers .

the integrated map developed for the eight parental cultivars included  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> snp  allowing for identifying the relative positions of markers not segregating in the same progeny population . three additional segregating snp could not be mapped due to inconsistencies in linkage analyses . molecular markers were distributed along all  <dig> chromosomes with an average distance between adjacent markers of  <dig>  cm . the integrated map had a total size of  <dig> cm , similar to other complete linkage maps published for vitis vinifera  <cit> . because the integrated map was based on mean recombination frequencies  <cit>  and a total of  <dig> progeny individuals was considered, it should provide a good estimation of genetic distances. however, the accuracy of the genetic position assigned to each marker is limited by the number of progenies in which it is segregating, the segregation types in each progeny, the presence of markers with distorted segregations and the possible existence of differences in recombination rates among the progenitor cultivars. sixty-seven percent of the  <dig> snp markers mapped were segregating in more than one mapping population  and only  <dig> snp showed the less informative segregation type < abxab >. finally, distorted segregation rates were low in dominga × autumn seedless, monastrell × cabernet sauvignon and muscat hamburg × sugraone crosses , but higher in ruby × moscatuel , which is likely due to the smaller size of the progeny .

sequence searches for the snp surrounding sequences  within the 12× genomic sequence of vitis vinifera http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/genomebrowser/vitis/ allowed for physically positioning most of the studied snp . two-hundred and twenty-five out of the  <dig> polymorphic snp could be positioned on the physical map with an average of  <dig> snp per chromosome . the average distance among physically mapped snp was  <dig>  mb. thirteen snp could not be physically located. this could be either due to the lack of significant matches with the 12× genomic sequence , the identification of different locations with the same likelihood  or their localization on unlinked chromosome scaffolds. linkage mapping allowed for localizing  <dig> out of the  <dig> snp that could not be positioned in the physical map . the only marker that could not be mapped either physical or genetically  corresponds with one of the two snp where adjacent sequences could not be found in the search on the 12× genome sequence.

marker order was generally conserved between physical and genetic maps, although discrepancies were found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> involving differences of up to  <dig>  mb and  <dig> cm. in addition, small local marker inversions, involving <  <dig>  mb and <  <dig> cm distances, were observed for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . most of these discrepancies could be attributed to some of the previously mentioned factors affecting the accuracy of the genetic position assigned to each marker. however, none of these factors were present in the most important differences , which points out some problems in the current physical map of those regions and that may be related to genome rearrangements or assembly errors on the 12× grapevine sequence of the pn <dig> near homozygous line http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/genomebrowser/vitis/. for example, marker snp425_ <dig>  showed significant discrepancies between physical and genetic distances with the surrounding markers leading to differences in marker order for this region . in the current 12× version of the genomic sequence of vitis vinifera, this marker is at  <dig>  mb from snp613_ <dig> . however, marker order on the genetic map aligns with marker order in the version of the genomic sequence  in which both snp are separated by  <dig>  mb as well as with marker order in the pinot noir sequence http://genomics.research.iasma.it/gb2/gbrowse/grape/.

selection of the snp set for genetic identification
currently, intra-laboratory genetic identification of grapevine varieties does not represent a major problem given the large number of microsatellite and snp markers that have become available over the years  <cit> . however, it is very important to develop a system that is efficient, rapid and cheap for identifying the several thousand cultivars currently available in grapevine. this requires the careful design of a set of highly polymorphic and stable markers with proven quality and reproducibility that allow for constructing databases easy to share among different laboratories. in order to develop such a system based on snp markers, three selection criteria were considered: high frequency of genotyping success, high minor allele frequency  to provide higher pic and good chromosomal distribution to end up with a total of  <dig> snp distributed at a rate of 2- <dig> snp per chromosome. when these criteria were applied on the available snp , a selection that was used for the design of a  <dig> snp set  was obtained. a completely new design with only the selected  <dig> snp set was built, and their stability and quality for genetic identification was thoroughly evaluated.

evaluation of the stability of the snp set for genetic identification
stability of the  <dig> snp markers was evaluated through the analysis of the genotypes obtained for an average of  <dig> plants for each  <dig> cultivars . this study also allowed for scoring the rate of genotyping success. the  <dig> cultivars represent a large phenotypic diversity for important traits in grapevine regarding their use , berry colour , maturity time , presence of seeds  and other traits  <cit> . in addition to their diverse geographical origin , the  <dig> cultivars exhibit age differences as well: from very ancient cultivars, likely more than thousand years old , to cultivars originating only a few centuries ago .

a total of  <dig> plants were analyzed with the newly designed  <dig> snp set. table  <dig> shows the genotypes obtained for each variety. no genotype could be established in any of the plants for snp vv <dig> and, therefore, was excluded from the analysis. nevertheless, this snp worked regularly in other genotyping analyses and was included in further tests. in addition, genotyping for snp325_ <dig> and vv <dig> failed completely in the 'monastrell' cultivar. the genotype for snp325_ <dig> could be obtained for this cultivar after several analyses but this was not the case for vv <dig> . the existence of a homozygous null allele in this cultivar for vv <dig> was discarded because it presented an a/t genotype for this snp in the previous genotyping with the  <dig> snp set.

*the correct genotype is ac, according to data obtained later 

a complete genotype  was obtained for  <dig> plants corresponding to an average of  <dig> plants per variety with a range from  <dig> to  <dig> plants  excluding 'monastrell'. no genotype could be established for  <dig> plants. this could be due to a low dna concentration in a number of cases  but, in most cases, failures were probably due to the presence of contaminants that prevented amplification. apart from the cases where no plant  nor snp  could be genotyped, the average genotyping rate was  <dig> % . marker snp697_ <dig> presented the highest genotyping success rate and only failed in two plants. ten snp markers presented a genotyping success rate above  <dig> , and  <dig> snp above  <dig> .

* excluding  <dig> snp that did not work in this experiment and  <dig> plants for which none snp genotype could be established.

regarding the stability analysis,  <dig> % of all the genotyped plants showed the genotype expected for the cultivar. only three snp showed a different genotype in plants of the same cultivar: snp1119_ <dig> and snp581_ <dig> , and snp1347_ <dig> . to determine if these variations were due to mutations  or genotyping errors, the analyses were repeated using the same dna extraction as well as independent dna extractions for each plant. the results indicate that all discrepancies corresponded to genotyping errors. in summary, no mutation could be found in the  <dig> individual snp genotypes established for the  <dig> varieties studied and, therefore, the snp marker set could be considered highly stable.

evaluation of the snp set for genetic identification purposes
a total of  <dig> grapevine accessions were genotyped with the  <dig> snp set including a sample from each of the varieties studied in the stability analysis. some of the accessions resulted in identical genotypes but these results always agreed with the expectations; since they corresponded either to synonymous cultivars or sports . sports are not expected to differ from their initial cultivar by using molecular markers. this was confirmed for several sports: 'chasselas apyrene', a seedless sport, did not differ from 'chasselas blanc'. within the pinot group, 'pinot blanc' showed an identical genotype for the  <dig> snp set to 'pinot noir' and also 'pinot meunier', a genetic chimera  <cit> , showed the same genotype. nevertheless, 'pinot gris', another colour sport, presented a homozygous genotype cc for snp1229_ <dig>  while the other cultivars of the group were heterozygous cg. this is not surprising since the 'pinot' group has the largest intra-varietal variation measured with microsatellite markers  <cit> .

another one-allele difference was observed when genotypes obtained in this study were compared with those obtained for the same varieties in the stability analysis  but, while in the case of 'pinot gris' the difference was consistent and could be considered a genetic mutation, in the later cases they were shown to be due to genotyping errors. the difference was observed in  <dig> varieties for the snp1119_ <dig> . in all cases a mistaken homozygous genotype  was assigned to plants studied in the stability analysis, while the correct one was heterozygote . these snp genotyping mistakes are more frequent when most samples in the plate have the same genotype, since reference genotype clouds corresponding to the three possible genotypes per snp locus are more difficult to establish. in fact, when some of these wrongly genotyped samples were re-analyzed with samples from other plates, they were assigned the correct heterozygous  genotype.

a non-redundant genotype sample was built to evaluate genetic parameters related to the discrimination power of the snp set for grapevine cultivars. of  <dig> accessions studied,  <dig> genotypes, corresponding to synonym cultivars, sports and wild plants, were discarded. in the resulting sample containing  <dig> non-redundant cultivars , allelic frequencies and several genetic parameters were determined. the maf is a measure of the discriminating ability of the markers. in the case of bi-allelic markers, the closer maf is to  <dig> , the better. in the study,  <dig> snp showed a maf between  <dig>  and  <dig> , while only three snp had a maf below  <dig> . the unbiased expected heterozygosity  was  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . only three snp showed pic values below  <dig> , the remaining comprised between  <dig>  and  <dig> . these values indicate that the whole snp set has a very high discriminating capacity for grapevine varieties, and is supported by the very low global probability of identity :  <dig> ·10- <dig>  this value is much smaller than that obtained with the  <dig> ssr markers approved as descriptors by the international organisation of vine and wine  in the analysis of  <dig> unique spanish genotypes  and with  <dig> microsatellites in the analysis of  <dig> european cultivars , or of  <dig> grapevine accessions . in contrast, the pi obtained for the  <dig> snp set is larger than the value obtained with  <dig> microsatellites in  <dig>  grapevine accessions , or with  <dig> microsatellites in  <dig> accessions . these representative examples show that, on the average, the probability of identity per microsatellite marker is between  <dig>  and  <dig>  while the average in the snp set used here is  <dig>  per marker. therefore, 3- <dig> snp loci would be needed to provide the discriminating power of one microsatellite locus in grapevine. correspondingly, the  <dig> snp set would give a similar identification power as 14- <dig> microsatellites.

the task of cultivar characterization is often related to legal issues. of utmost importance is that in the technical test any variety has to overcome the authorization to be cultivated in many countries and that distinctness is the most important issue to be established in such tests: a variety is considered distinct if it can be clearly distinguished from all the varieties of common knowledge  convention, 1991; http://www.upov.org/en/publications/conventions/1991/act <dig> htm). the key concept for establishing distinctness is the minimum distance between varieties, which is currently established on a species by species basis, using morphological descriptors. in recent years, some efforts have been directed to incorporate molecular markers  <cit> . in the present study, the minimum distance among the varieties with non-redundant genotypes was determined through their pair-wise comparison and measured by the number of different alleles . the average difference between analyzed cultivars was  <dig> alleles from a total of  <dig> while the most different samples differed in  <dig> alleles. the closest cultivars found were 'jaén negra' and 'zalema', which differed in  <dig> alleles out of the  <dig> that could be compared between them. these two cultivars have genotypes that are compatible with being parent/offspring, both based on microsatellites  <cit>  as well as the snp markers used in this study. the next closest cultivars found were 'ciruela roja' and 'colgar roja' that differed in  <dig> out of the  <dig> alleles studied. these two cultivars have recently been described as siblings of the same cross: 'ohanes' × 'ragol'  <cit> . the same occurs with 'chardonnay' and 'melon', which matched for  <dig> alleles and have microsatellite genotypes consistent with being the progeny of a single pair of parents, 'pinot' and 'gouais blanc'  <cit> . hence cultivars studied even those genetically close, present large measured differences in the number of diverse alleles.

from the data, a very clear border exists between the highest intra-varietal variability  with  <dig> different allele and the lowest inter-varietal distance of  <dig> different alleles. thus, there should not be any difficulty in establishing a minimum distance between  <dig> and  <dig> alleles for the  <dig> snp set and it is large enough as to be considered conclusive for establishing distinctness in grapevine cultivars . still a more extensive diversity study would be needed to find a more reliable minimum distance, since it could be shorter in full siblings derived from closely related progenitors as those used in current table grape breeding.

the mendelian genetic inheritance of these  <dig> snp markers has been confirmed in several previously described mapping populations. this feature also permits the genetic examination of pedigrees and parent/offspring relationships. using the selected  <dig> snp set, the total exclusion probability of paternity found for the set of  <dig> cultivars was high  but the number of markers is far too small for a reliable pedigree analysis. logarithm of odds  scores obtained for several trios ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  which are not large enough to reach final conclusions.

CONCLUSIONS
a set of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been selected well distributed throughout the grapevine genome and tested for genetic identification purposes. the selected markers have proven to be highly stable and repeatable and also have a high discriminating power for grapevine cultivars. snp data do not require any allele binning and allows for direct databasing and direct comparison of data arising from different laboratories. all these characteristics make our set of markers very suitable for the building of a worldwide publicly available genotype database for grapevine cultivars.
