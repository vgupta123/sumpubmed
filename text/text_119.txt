BACKGROUND
zebrafish  is used as a model system in many different scientific fields due to its rapid development in combination with a relatively short generation time and ease of genetic manipulation  <cit> . however, the most prominent application of zebrafish has probably been within developmental biology. this is due to the ease with which the embryos are obtained, in addition to the transparency of the developing zebrafish embryo, which greatly aids observation of developmental processes.

dna sequencing has increased tremendously in throughput with the advent of next-generation sequencing   <cit> . briefly, the technology generates millions of short dna sequence reads from a sample. the technology has recently been applied to transcriptome profiling  <cit> , in which rna from a sample is converted into cdna, fragmented, and sequenced. denoted rna-seq, it offers several advantages as compared to previous profiling applications, such as microarrays or quantitative rt-pcr. most importantly, rna-seq does not rely on predefined probes, and consequently allows for discovery of new transcript variants and for distinction between closely homologous genes  <cit> . moreover, alternatively spliced transcripts  <cit>  and non-conding rnas  <cit>  can be characterized and monitored. in addition, by sustained sequencing, there is virtually no limit in sensitivity, which enables the detection of rare transcripts that may be undetectable in microarray analysis  <cit> .

a more complete characterization of the zebrafish genome, in combination with additional knowledge of the zebrafish transcriptome, would enable access to the full potential of this powerful vertebrate model system. previous studies have investigated parts of the zebrafish transcriptome during development and in adult tissues  <cit> . in addition, there has been a recent addition of several rna-seq tracks of zebrafish early embryos to ensembl's zv <dig>  however, the present study is to our knowledge the first study to utilize the new technology of rna-seq to compare the transcriptome during early stages of zebrafish development and thereby increasing the known number of developmentally regulated transcripts.

four early embryonic stages  were chosen in order to investigate and compare the transcriptome during early zebrafish development. the newly fertilized egg is in the zygote period until the first cleavage occurs, about  <dig> minutes after fertilization  <cit> . at the 1-cell stage the genome is silent and the transcriptome consists by definition of maternal transcripts. the 16-cell stage occurs at  <dig>  hours post-fertilization  and during this time some of the blastomeres are still interconnected. at the 512-cell stage  the mid-blastula transition  begins, the embryo genome is activated and the cell cycles lengthen gradually  <cit> . in zebrafish development gastrulation starts at the 50%-epiboly stage  when the blastoderm margin has moved to 50% of the distance between the animal and vegetal pole  <cit> . by comparing the 1-cell stage, 16-cell stage, 512-cell stage and 50% epiboly stage gene expression profiles we provide a framework for future investigations of early developmental processes. the aim of this study was to compare the transcriptional profile of four early developmental stages in zebrafish using rna-seq, and in addition use these gene expression profiles to identify novel candidate genes with possible key roles during early development. furthermore, the detection of a number of developmentally interesting gene transcripts in the present study is discussed in relation to previously published observations.

RESULTS
quantifying developmentally expressed transcripts using rna-seq
rna-seq was used in order to investigate the early zebrafish transcriptome. the rna-seq resulted in approximately  <dig> m total reads from the 1-cell stage,  <dig> m total reads from the 16-cell stage,  <dig> m total reads from the 512-cell stage and  <dig> m total reads from the 50% epiboly stage . out of the total number of reads for each stage 68%, 70%, 73% and 65% respectively, were successfully mapped. from these mapped reads the percentage of uniquely mapped reads for the four stages were 44%, 40%, 38% and 36%, respectively. the uniquely mapped reads had higher quality  compared to multiply mapped reads . therefore, overall read quality does in part explain low unique mapping rate. however, the fraction of uniquely mapped reads is similar to that previously reported  <cit> . the sequence data  is available at the european nucleotide archive http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/.

numbers of total reads obtained during rna-seq of the studied developmental stages, numbers of reads mapped to the exon model, numbers of reads being filtered and the numbers of uniquely mapped reads used for further analysis of gene expression.

reads were assigned to transcripts based on their overlap with the  <dig> reference gene models defined in the ucsc refseq genes track. an ad hoc cutoff for detectable expression was set at >=  <dig> reads per transcript. using this cutoff,  <dig> gene transcripts could be detected in the rna-seq data set, leaving  <dig> transcripts undetected . these  <dig> non-detected gene transcripts were enriched in go molecular functions seemingly unrelated to early development, such as olfactory receptor activity and photoreceptor activity among others .

in order to investigate the dynamics of the zebrafish early transcriptome the number of detected transcripts shared between the studied developmental stages was determined . the shared transcripts were  <dig> between the 1-cell stage and 16- cell stage, and this number decreased with developmental progression . thus the 1-cell and 50% epiboly stages shared  <dig> transcripts. these observed differences in shared transcripts between the different developmental stages may reflect the transcriptional similarity between stages pre-mbt, and the increased transcriptional heterogeneity of the cellular population post-mbt.

the number for transcripts shared only between two developmental stages was lower, with the 1-cell stage sharing  <dig> transcripts with the 16-cell stage,  <dig> transcripts with the 512-cell stage and  <dig> transcripts with 50% epiboly stage . in turn, 50% epiboly stage shared  <dig> transcripts with 512-cell stage and  <dig> transcripts with the 16-cell stage. the number of shared transcripts between the 16-cell stage and the 512-cell stage was  <dig>  these results indicate that transcripts present at the 1-cell stage are depleted during the progression of development, only to reappear in the 50% epiboly stage after the mbt has taken place.

a majority of the gene transcripts shared between the pre-mbt developmental stages coded for membrane-associated proteins, such as members of the solute carrier  gene superfamily, whereas gene transcripts shared between 512-cell stage and 50% epiboly were involved in transcription regulation and patterning . this group of shared gene transcripts contains members of the fork head box  transcription factor family and fibroblast growth factors , which are known to be involved in regulation of developmental processes. the appearance of these transcripts coincides with the cell faith determination and differentiation that takes place during zebrafish gastrulation.

gene expression profiling reveals a static expression profile for a majority of genes
to classify the dynamics of the early zebrafish transcriptome on a global scale we performed gene expression profile clustering. the  <dig> gene transcripts detected in the rna-seq were categorized into  <dig> different clusters on account of their expression pattern during development . four clusters including  <dig> genes showed visually increasing expression profile patterns with progressing development  and three clusters containing a total of  <dig> genes showed decreasing expression profiling patterns . with  <dig> gene transcripts detected as developmentally regulated when comparing the transcriptomes of the four developmental stages a majority of gene transcripts thus cluster as present at a steady level. furthermore, these steady level transcripts are present at different rpkm  expression levels in the four studied developmental stages.

go term enrichment among the differentially expressed genes
in order to determine if there was an enrichment of gene transcripts with related functions in the four studied developmental stages the go term enrichment of the  <dig> detected gene transcripts were investigated. using go term finder  <cit>  to search for molecular function enrichment within the subset of genes from the gene expression profiling clusters with an increase in expression during development , a significant increase in transcripts encoding nucleic acid binding and dna binding were found . this may reflect the developmental transitions taking place during mbt, when the transcription of the embryo genome is activated.

in the data set containing the genes clustering as decreasing during development , one go term molecular function was significantly enriched: polo kinase kinase activity . this activity is associated with the cell cycle  <cit>  and oocyte maturation  <cit> .

variation in high rpkm-level transcript populations during development
the total number of different gene transcripts detected was in the same range for all four developmental stages. a total of  <dig> gene transcripts were found in the 1-cell stage as compared to  <dig> and  <dig> gene transcripts found in the 16-cell stage and 512-cell stage respectively . after mbt, at 50% epiboly stage, the corresponding number of genes found to be expressed was  <dig>  to investigate whether or not the same transcripts were present a high levels throughout the four studied developmental stages the transcripts with the highest rpkm values in each stage were compared. when ranking the transcripts detected after highest rpkm values, eight out of the ten transcripts found in the 1-, 16- and 512-cell stages were identical . however, the ten most abundant transcripts in 50% epiboly stage were not represented in the 1- and 16-cell stage, and only one transcript  was found among the top ten 512-cell stage genes. within this group of highly expressed genes were claudins , cyclins  and metal-binding proteins  among others. thus from this observation it appears that the developmental stages up until mbt have a relative high level expression of several identical gene transcripts. furthermore, with the subsequent activation of the embryo genome a change in the identity of highly expressed genes can be observed.

pre-mbt and mbt developmental stages  were shown to have similar composition of high abundance transcripts, in contrast to the post-mbt stage . the refseq accession numbers for each detected transcript is given in the table.

enrichment of go molecular functions in gene transcripts detected at high levels
in order to compare the possible functions of the transcripts identified from the rna-seq analysis of the different developmental stages, the  <dig> genes with the highest rpkm values for each stage were selected and analyzed for function using go term finder  <cit> . significant enrichment of several go molecular functions was found in this subset of relatively highly expressed genes .

the earliest three stages showed a high degree of similarity in enriched functions, whereas the 50% epiboly differed from the earlier developmental stages. for example, protein serine/threonine kinase activity was significantly enriched only in the first three developmental stages . within this group of transcripts the polo-like kinases plk <dig>  plk <dig> and plk <dig> can be found. another molecular function enriched in these three developmental stages was nuclease activity. in this group is the endoribonuclease dicer <dig>  which codes for an enzyme involved in mirna synthesis. mutating dicer <dig> blocks the formation of mature mirnas and leads to abnormal gastrulation morphology  <cit> . the enrichment of dicer <dig> in the three pre-mbt developmental stages may reflect dicer <dig> involvement in the peak of mirna levels observed at the onset of mbt with subsequent degradation/silencing of maternal rnas  <cit> . interestingly, methyltransferase activity was the only significantly enriched go molecular function found in the 1-cell stage, whereas molecular functions significantly enriched exclusively in the 50% epiboly stage included transcription, protein folding/processing and ion binding . taken together these observations indicate that there is a shift in the molecular functions of the expressed gene transcripts taking place during the mbt, from the early stages enrichment of nuclease activity before mbt, reflecting the developmental importance of mirna and rna processing, towards the enrichment of transcription functions in the 50% epiboly stage related to mbt and the onset of transcription.

a number of transcripts are detected at only one specific developmental stage
gene transcripts detected at only one developmental stage were investigated for enrichment of go annotations in order to determine if the developmental transition in gene transcript molecular function enrichment observed for highly expressed gene transcripts also could be detected in stage specific gene transcripts.

the total number of genes detected at one specific developmental stage varied between the stages, with the largest number of detected stage-specific gene transcripts found in the 50% epiboly stage , followed by the 1-cell , 16-cell  and the 512-cell stage , respectively . the  <dig> genes detected in the 1-cell stage displayed no significant enrichment of go molecular functions. however, when investigating the enrichment of go term cellular components and biological processes there was significant enrichment of extracellular region components and multicellular organismal process, developmental process, multicellular organismal development, thyroid gland development and anatomical structure development .

interestingly, among the gene transcripts detected at the 16-cell stage  and the 512-cell stage , there was a significant enrichment of the go molecular functions associated with transcription , whereas go biological process terms and cellular component terms showed no significant enrichment. similar go molecular terms were found significantly enriched among the  <dig> gene transcripts specifically expressed in the 50% epiboly stage . only the go cellular component cell junction was significantly enriched in this subset and there was no enrichment of go biological process terms. these observations correlate with the observed change in enriched go molecular functions for the highly expressed subset of gene transcripts, displaying enrichment in transcription-related gene transcripts with progressing development. however, the number of stage-specific gene transcripts detected was small and the gene transcripts were found present at relatively low rpkm levels making it difficult to assess their biological relevance.

validation of gene transcripts detected during zebrafish early development
several genes were found to vary in expression during the developmental stages investigated. to further compare and validate the expression of a subset of these genes tlda  and semi-quantitative rt-pcr  were used. several tlda gene assays were chosen for their known involvement in vertebrate pluripotency and differentiation processes . a few developmentally uncharacterized genes that were detected in the rna-seq data set were also included. furthermore, semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis was used to investigate and validate the detection of a number of developmentally expressed genes, such as plk <dig>  foxa <dig>  foxa <dig> , slc39a <dig>  zgc: <dig>  and pou5f <dig>  klf <dig> and foxa <dig> . the tlda  and semi-quantitative rt-pcr  analyses showed similar expression patterns as previously observed using rna-seq, thus confirming the developmental regulation of the investigated gene transcripts.

putative novel transcribed regions detected by rna-seq
a significant advantage of rna-seq compared to microarrays is that it is possible to identify and characterize novel mrna transcripts. it is likely that there are many yet unidentified transcripts that play important roles in early development. therefore, in order to identify putative novel transcribed regions, mapped reads were clustered into seqfrags  <cit> . a seqfrag contains at least two reads with overlapping coordinates on the same strand. seqfrags with more than  <dig> reads located at least  <dig> kb from known ucsc reference genes and ensembl genes  <cit>  were called as putative novel transcribed regions. in this way a total number of  <dig> putative novel transcribed regions could be identified .  <dig> of these putative novel transcribed regions were identified in the 1-cell stage, followed by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> putative novel transcribed regions in 16-cell, 512-cell and 50% epiboly stages respectively. sharing of transcripts between developmental stages is consistent with our previous results for known genes; sharing is highest between the three first stages , and the 50% epiboly stage has the largest amount of unique novel transcripts  . this confirms the overall picture of a major transition in transcriptional activity taking place between the 512-cell stage and the 50% epiboly stage. we validated the expression of one putative novel transcribed region located on chromosome  <dig> by regular pcr amplification from cdna and subsequent sequencing . the sequence shows significant similarity to a recently predicted zebrafish protein, a-kinase anchor protein  <dig> . this indicates that we have identified a potentially novel transcript in our rna-seq dataset, demonstrating the utility of the rna-seq method for annotation and characterization of the zebrafish early transcriptome.

discussion
rna-seq detection of developmentally expressed gene transcripts
the number of unique mapped reads obtained using rna-seq was on average  <dig> million for all four studied developmental stages  with a total number of  <dig> different gene transcripts detected. about  <dig>  m reads were mapped to known junctions in each stage. the  <dig> gene transcripts that were not detected , showed enrichment of go functional terms seemingly unrelated to early development, such as olfactory receptor activity . apart from being undetected because they are not expressed these transcripts may be undetected due to them not being present in the unfertilized oocyte and thus not carried forward as maternal transcripts, that they are specifically degraded before 1-cell stage or that their expression is too low to be detected with the sequencing depth reached in this study. for example, maternal degradation of sox11a, one of the non-detected transcripts, has been previously shown  <cit> , thus offering an explanation to its absence in our dataset.

similar numbers of transcripts detected in the four developmental stages studied
the total number of different transcripts found in the four studied stages was very similar, despite the fact that the sample points cover development from 1-cell stage up until 50% epiboly . a degradation of maternal rna taking place pre-mbt has been reported in zebrafish  <cit>  and this may cause the modest decrease observed in unique transcripts that occurs between the 1-cell stage and 512-cell stage. in addition, the number of transcripts found only at one specific stage was low, indicating that the majority of transcripts needed for development beyond 50% epiboly are already present at the 1-cell stage.

pre-mbt developmental stages have similar high abundance transcript profile
the ten most abundant transcripts in the four different stages during development were almost identical for the 1-, 16-, and 512-cell stage, whereas in the 50% epiboly stage the most abundant transcripts differed from previous developmental stages . these abundant transcripts code mainly for nucleic acid binding proteins , metal ion binding proteins , cell adhesion proteins , proteolytic proteins  and proteins involved in the cell cycle . a few of these have been implicated in vertebrate development previously, while the specific developmental roles of the others are yet unknown. for instance zgc: <dig>  a putative epithelial cell adhesion molecule, has been implicated in epiboly  <cit> . from our rna-seq data it is indicated that zgc: <dig> may have additional functions during early development, since the transcript is detected at relatively high levels already at 1- and 16-cell stage.

early stage-specific transcripts are detected at low expression levels
the subsets of gene transcripts found exclusively in 1-, 16- and 512-cell stages were detected at relatively low rpkm levels. although the biological relevance of transcripts at such low rpkm values might be uncertain, a number of these transcripts have been previously reported as expressed during early development. for example, in the present study vegfaa, ing <dig> and elovl <dig> were among the most abundant transcripts detected only in the 1-cell stage . in a previous microarray-based study human vegfa and ing <dig> transcripts were found in gv, mi and mii oocytes  <cit>  and using rt-pcr elovl <dig> has been detected in zebrafish embryos at  <dig> hpf  <cit> . vegfaa plays a part in vascular development  <cit> , ing <dig> has been shown to be involved in chromatin remodeling  <cit> , and elovl <dig> is part of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . thus the detection of these transcripts in the 1-cell stage during zebrafish development is plausible and the respective function of these three genes further implies their involvement in later stages of embryo development.

methyltransferase activity is enriched at 1-cell stage
it has been postulated that during early development the embryo genome is silent and transcription is activated first at mbt. the observed enrichment of go methyltransferase activity in the 1-cell stage detected gene transcripts may reflect the developmental chromatin-modifying dynamics taking place . interestingly, dna methyltransferase  <dig>  was detected in all four stages, although with a decreasing gene expression profile . dnmt <dig> has been shown to direct terminal tissue differentiation in zebrafish and knocking down dnmt <dig> causes an increase in embryo mortality  <cit> . thus the observed developmental regulation of dnmt <dig> may reflect the suppression of transcription present pre-mbt.

polo kinase kinase activity associated transcripts decrease during development
interestingly, only one go term molecular function, polo kinase kinase activity, was enriched in the clusters displaying a decrease in gene expression profile . polo-like kinases 1- <dig>  were detected already at 1-cell stage suggesting that these transcripts are of maternal origin. both plk <dig> and plk <dig> were found at relatively high rpkm levels and decrease during development, whereas plk <dig> and plk <dig> were expressed at a lower level throughout the studied time period . plk <dig> has been previously reported to be expressed at the 8-cell stage and shown to be central to mitosis  <cit> . depletion of plk <dig> caused mitotic arrest and embryo death, whereas the structurally related plk <dig> and plk <dig> were found to be non-essential for embryo development. with the rate of mitosis declining during the development from 1-cell stage to gastrulation  <cit> , the decrease in plk <dig> transcript numbers observed in the present study are likely to be associated with the progressing development and decreasing rate of mitosis. in addition, the present finding of developmental regulation of plk <dig>  may reflect the importance of precise regulation of plk <dig> gene transcript levels in order to preserve genome integrity since increasing or decreasing the plk <dig> expression has been shown to cause chromosomal instability  <cit> .

developmentally interesting genes detected at 1-cell stage
we find among the  <dig> transcripts detected at the 1-cell stage several known maternal gene transcripts, as well as previously unreported maternal transcripts. for example, the tudor domain containing  <dig>  was detected at the 1-cell stage , in accordance with the reported presence of tdrd <dig> in 4-cell embryos  <cit> . tdrd <dig> function is required for development of the correct number and size of germ cell granules in zebrafish germ cells. in addition, tdrd <dig> has been shown to be a target of mir- <dig>  a mirna involved in the degradation of zebrafish maternal rnas pre-mbt  <cit> . mir- <dig> specific targeting of tdrd <dig> may thus explain the decrease in expression levels detected at the 50% epiboly stage . another interesting find at 1-cell stage was the previously unreported zgc: <dig>  which displayed an increasing expression profile during developmental progression . interestingly, the zgc: <dig> contains a dep domain known to be involved in signal transduction . this domain can be found in such proteins as dishevelled  in the wnt signaling pathway, suggesting that zgc: <dig> might be involved in signaling events during early development. in a recent report zgc: <dig> was shown to be first expressed in the enveloping layer at 4hpf using whole-mount in situ  <cit> . the discordance in developmental stage of detection in the present study may indicate the higher sensitivity of rna-seq when detecting early transcripts. the specific role of zgc: <dig> during development is not known. in addition, two of the four so-called yamanaka transcription factors, krüppel-like factor  <dig>  and pou-domain class  <dig> transcription factor  <dig> , were detected already at 1-cell stage and showed a large increase in rpkm value at the 50% epiboly stage .

developmental function of maternal transcripts
previously reported numbers of maternal transcripts varies between species. in fully-grown zebrafish follicles  <dig> different transcripts have been reported  <cit> . zebrafish are oviparous animals and subsequently the zebrafish embryo may be more dependent on factors transferred from the female to the egg prior to fertilization than the embryos of viviparous species. it has been speculated that during evolution a shift from zygotic to maternal expression has taken place in oviparous species saving energy and allowing for earlier hatching through the transfer of transcripts  <cit> . however, these transcripts may also function indirectly as a nutrition source providing nucleotides and phosphorous  <cit>  implying that all maternal transcripts do not have to be directly involved in embryonic developmental processes per se. this may explain the present finding of a relatively large number of different transcripts detected in the 1-cell stage, as well as to the small number of 1-cell stage specific transcripts .

detected increase in gene transcript levels before the onset of mbt
the postulated pre-mbt transcriptional repression may not be global. in fact, an extensive microarray based study by mathavan et al.  reports accumulation of  <dig> gene transcripts before the onset of mbt  <cit> . in the present study we observe a small subset of genes with increasing rpkm levels at the start of the mbt, but several of the genes previously reported do not correlate with our rna-seq expression profiles  . this may be due to differences in embryo sample time point and/or methodological differences between microarray and rna-seq. furthermore, the peak in transcript accumulation detected at 68/128-cell stage by mathavan et al.  need not persist until the 512-cell stage and may therefore not be detected in the present study. in order to further confirm the possibility of pre-mbt transcription a number of candidate genes were selected , sideroflexin  <dig> , zinc transporter solute carrier family  <dig>  member  <dig> , cytotoxic granule-associated rna binding protein  <dig>  like , transformer- <dig> alpha ), and their developmental expression pattern analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. in the expression analysis sideroflexin  <dig>  and transformer- <dig> alpha  showed a modest accumulation before the onset of mbt, whereas the zinc transporter slc39a <dig> displayed a 2-fold increase in relative transcript levels already at 16-cell stage . sfxn <dig> on the other hand has been shown previously to be increased at the 64-cell stage  <cit>  and the present data indicates that this accumulation takes place after the 16-cell stage . the early accumulation of slc39a <dig> could also be observed in the rna-seq data set . the accumulation of transcripts at different developmental stages prior to mbt may indicate their involvement in specific processes such as transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome and make them suitable candidates for future functional studies.

fox gene family transcription level increase coincides with mbt
members of the fox gene family were detected as shared between the 512-cell stage and 50% epiboly stage  and shown to vary in expression levels during development . the expression of these genes has been reported during gastrulation and neurulation  <cit> , but the role of the fox gene family during zebrafish pre-mbt development has not been completely characterized. foxa has been suggested to be an early transcription factor able to open up compacted chromatin structures, thereby facilitating the binding of other transcription factors  <cit> . thus the detected upregulation of foxa <dig>  and foxa <dig>  transcripts between 512-cell stage and 50% epiboly may indicate a role in the onset of transcription during zebrafish early development.

enrichment of nucleic acid binding and structural molecule activity function post-mbt
the four clusters displaying an increase in rpkm values during development  were significantly enriched for go molecular functions such as nucleic acid binding, structural molecule activity, dna binding and binding . similar profiles during early development have been previously reported in other teleost species  <cit> . this enrichment profile may reflect the need for dna binding molecules such as transcription factors for the activation and continued transcription of the genome. in turn, the increase in structural molecule activity might be explained by the factors needed for the increase in cell number that takes place during development, as well as by the involvement of structural molecules in the gastrulation process. if considering only cell structural molecules, the very early cleavages essentially consist of one large cell that is being rapidly cleaved into many smaller cells, and thus the need for structural components will increase in later stages of development . accordingly, we find in this group several cytokeratins, such as krt <dig> and krt <dig> , which have been shown to be present at protein level during post-mbt development  <cit> . interestingly, disrupting the expression of the fox gene family member foxh <dig> during zebrafish development has been shown to significantly lower krt <dig> and krt <dig> levels, disrupt gastrulation and cause death at  <dig> day post fertilization  <cit> . increasing levels of foxh <dig> is detected during the studied developmental stages and correlates with the observed increase in krt <dig> and krt <dig> levels . another transcript found in these clusters is tight junction component cldn e. cldn e was recently reported to be required for zebrafish epiboly  <cit> . accordingly, we find the cldn e to increase in abundance from 512-cell stage to 50% epiboly .

post-mbt stage specific transcripts are detected at relatively high levels
in comparison to the 1-to 512-cell stage specific gene transcript levels, the transcripts found only at the 50% epiboly stage have relatively higher rpkm values. the higher abundance of transcripts at this stage may be a result of the activation of transcription and the appearance of novel post-mbt transcripts. accordingly, in this subset of genes we find an enrichment of go molecular functions such as sequence specific dna binding, receptor binding, nucleic acid transcription factor activity and sequence specific factor activity .

claudin f transcript is only detected after the onset of epiboly
among the most abundant gene transcripts detected only in 50% epiboly is claudin f  . claudins have been shown to accumulate to relatively high transcript levels during early zebrafish development  <cit>  and are involved in cell adhesion . interestingly, the cldn f-related cldn d and cldn g are detected at high rpkm levels from the 1-cell stage up until the 512-cell stage , only to decrease in relative abundance during 50% epiboly . this observation indicates different developmental functions for these three cell adhesion proteins. in accordance with this, clelland and kelly  show cldn d to be highly expressed in ovary but absent from many other adult tissues. furthermore, they reported a low but detectable expression of cldn f in the eye, gill and ovary  <cit> .

enrichment of metal ion binding molecular functions after the onset of mbt
from our results we observe a significant enrichment of go molecular functions such as ion binding, cation binding, metal ion binding, zinc ion binding and dna binding in the  <dig> highest expressed genes during the 50% epiboly stage . the upregulation of these transcripts may reflect the molecular function demands post-mbt. this is plausible taking into account that metal ion and metal ion interactions play an important role in conformation, topology, stability and folding kinetics of nucleic acids  <cit> . furthermore, metal ions may also play an important role in rna function . in addition, transcription factors have been shown to be dependent on zinc and other metals for their activity and specificity  <cit> . subsequently, we find many zinc finger motif containing protein-coding genes in the go term metal binding enriched gene subset. the importance of metal homeostasis during embryonic development has been shown  <cit>  and the deleterious effects of heavy metals on embryonic development in fish are well known . interestingly, asymmetric distribution of metals has been shown in xenopus  oocytes and is believed to provide a framework for cell patterning during development  <cit> . thus the upregulation of genes with go molecular function metal ion binding and zinc ion binding may reflect not only the start of transcription activity but also a need of a precise concentration and distribution of metals throughout the developing embryo.

role of membrane-bound transporters during early development
during development the transport and gradient of different factors are important for the growth and differentiation of the embryo. in addition, several non-endogenous compounds such as drugs and environmental toxins are able to use these transporters  <cit> . exposure to non-endogenous compounds during early development often leads to death or malformation of the growing organism therefore it is of medical and pharmacological interest to obtain further understanding of the function of these transporters in embryo development. the slc gene superfamily consists of membrane-bound transporters  and several of these were detected in the four developmental stages studied . interestingly, the metal ion transporter solute carrier family  <dig>  had several members among the most abundant transcripts detected. in addition, slc39a <dig> belongs to the subset of gene transcripts displaying an increase in detected expression levels before mbt . another member of the slc <dig> subfamily detected was slc39a <dig> , which has been shown to be important in regulating zinc homeostasis in cells  <cit> . it has been suggested that slc39a <dig> mediated release of zinc from the er is required for tyrosine kinase activation  <cit> . inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity has been shown to cause developmental arrest at the beginning of epiboly  <cit> , therefore the observed pre-mbt increase of slc39a <dig> may be associated with the tyrosine kinase activity required for zebrafish gastrulation.

discovery of putative novel transcribed regions
recent studies have suggested that transcription may take place from a larger part of the vertebrate genome than previously thought  <cit> , thus a large number of unknown novel genes may yet remain to be discovered. when searching the rna-seq data for putative novel transcribed regions during development a total of  <dig> such regions could be detected in the four developmental stages studied . the largest number of stage-specific putative novel transcribed regions was found at 50% epiboly , perhaps reflecting a more transcriptional permissive state of the genome after mbt. the observation of these putative novel transcribed regions shows the potential of rna-seq for discovering novel gene transcripts and exemplifies one of the benefits of rna-seq compared to microarray gene expression analysis. with the increased accuracy of zebrafish genome sequencing and the development of new rna-seq analyzing software, it may be possible to extract new information from our dataset and make additional observations that are cumbersome by the tools available at present.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study rna-seq was used to describe the expression profiles of  <dig> gene transcripts detected during early zebrafish development. with the transition from the 1-cell stage to 50% epiboly a number of gene transcripts with different go molecular functions from previous stages becomes significantly enriched among the most highly expressed genes indicating a switch in the developmental transcriptome . in addition, several genes are shown to be present at the 1-cell stage and developmentally regulated during zebrafish early development. a number of gene transcripts detected in this study has been previously implicated in developmental processes thus corroborating our findings. moreover, we show that rna-seq may be used for investigating expression profiles of developmentally uncharacterized gene transcripts as well as screening for putative novel transcribed regions thus providing a descriptive base for developmental studies. the characterization of the zebrafish early transcriptome presented in this study provides a stepping-stone for further studies into the earliest processes taking place during vertebrate development. with the aid of new sequencing technology it is possible to obtain a vast amount of information about the early zebrafish transcriptome and the changes in global gene profiles during development. a potential concern of the current study is the lack of biological replicates. replicates were performed of the 1-cell stage to assess reproducibility, with technical replicate showing high  reproducibility, and biological replicate somewhat lower  reproducibility . the pooling of a large number of embryos somewhat remediate this problem, since the detected expression levels are population averages. in addition, both tlda and semi-quantitative rt-pcr validates the expressional profiles obtained for several gene transcripts present in the rna-seq data set. however, small differences in expression should still be interpreted with caution. despite these issues, our data serve as a valuable resource for further validation and meta-analyses of zebrafish early development. thus the observations presented in this study may contribute to the many research fields that are using zebrafish as a model system and add knowledge to developmental biology as such. considering the on-going improvement of rna-seq methodology and the recent possibility of sequencing single-embryo transcriptomes  <cit> , we will focus future studies on describing zebrafish development on a single-embryo level and combining transcriptome analyses with studies of the early proteome.
