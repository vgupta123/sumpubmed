BACKGROUND
with the demonstration that foreign dna can be stably introduced into plant cells in the 1980's, the generation of transgenic plants has become a commercial industry and its use in agriculture has continually grown with production surpassing  <dig> million ha in  <dig> countries  <cit> . the most commonly enhanced traits being herbicide tolerance, pest resistance, or both traits stacked together  <cit> . the advancement of plant genetic engineering has led to more sophisticated techniques and strategies being utilized for value added crop production. for many years it has been known that the structure of a transgene locus can have a major influence on the level and stability of transgene expression. therefore researchers have studied methods for precise dna integration with particularly interest in how to stack transgenes 'cleanly' to prevent interaction with the plant's genome defense and silencing systems. the idea of 'clean' integration and or stacking benefits commercialization for it addresses concerns by the public and regulatory authorities  <cit> . therefore as the practices of transgenic technology are coming under greater scrutiny, research focusing on eliminating marker genes and vector sequences, and controlling the integration of transgenes with regard to copy number, orientation, and rearrangements has been pursued. site-specific recombinase technology is a prominent tool for improving the precision by which crops are genetically engineered. in the last several years, recombinases have been shown to eliminate unneeded dna, resolve multimers and perform site-specific targeted integration in a variety of species.

the novel site-specific recombinase bxb <dig>  isolated from mycobacteriophage bxb <dig>  belongs to the large serine recombinase sub-family  <cit> . large serine recombinases act on two unique sequences, known as the recognition sites attp and attb, to yield the product sites known as attl and attr  <cit> . depending on the relative orientation of the attp and attb sites, the reaction can result in excision, inversion or integration of sequences between the recognition sites, and is not reversible unless an additional protein, an excisionase, is present. several recombinase systems of this type including bxb <dig>  tp901- <dig>  u <dig>  <cit>  and phic <dig>  <cit> , have been shown to function in eukaryotic cells. the bxb <dig> recombinase is a  <dig> amino acid protein that binds minimal recognition sites attp and attb that are  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively and enzymatically executes uni-directional site-specific recombination  <cit> . in vitro studies on the bxb <dig> system have shown that it can catalyze site-specific recombination in the absence of other proteins or high-energy cofactors  <cit> . the first plant study on the bxb1-att system demonstrating its functionality was conducted in tobacco protoplasts  <cit> . the bxb <dig> system has also been shown to function in insect and mammalian tissue culture cells  <cit> . the uni-directional mode of action of the bxb1-att system is an impotant attribute that differentiates its utility as a tool for genomic manipulation from other recombinase systems. for example, recombinases from the the small tyrosine family which have been shown to function in plants  all naturally perform bidirectional or fully reversible recombination reactions.

in previous studies, we identified a number of prokaryotic site-specific recombination systems that function in the eukaryote schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> . among those, the bxb <dig> uni-directional recombinase was highly efficient. the system has been successfully shown capable of recombinase mediated excision, inversion and integration reactions. while published evidence has demonstrated the bxb <dig> system can mediate integration events in tobacco protoplasts  <cit> , to our knowledge, heritable excision in planta has not been yet reported.

in this research, we examined the ability of the bxb1-att recombination system to mediate genomic site-specific excision from within the arabidopsis germline. plants transgenic for an attp and attb flanked target sequence were generated and subsequently retransformed with a second construct carrying the bxb <dig> transgene. the ability of the bxb <dig> recombinase to perform excision of the target sequence from four independent plant lines  and generate stably excised progeny plants that carry only the recombined target dna of interest was assessed. here, we report on the efficiency by which the excision event was heritably transmitted to subsequent generations in the absence of the recombinase gene.

RESULTS
experimental design
to test for site-specific recombination, we initially sought to use a gain-of-function strategy whereby excision of a transgene would lead to promoter fusion with a previously distal marker  <cit> . hence, pn6-bxb <dig> was configured with a camv 35s promoter  proximal to a  <dig> bp stuffer region followed by a distal gusa coding region . the stuffer region is flanked by directly oriented attp and attb recognition sites of the bxb <dig> recombinase. the expectation was that prior to site-specific recombination, 35s would not drive expression of gusa due the presence of the stuffer region. after recombination, the stuffer would be removed and activate expression of the gusa reporter gene . in this strategy, we first introduced the recombination target  into the arabidopsis genome via agrobacterium transformation. these target lines, or 'ta' lines, were then transformed with the second construct, pcoxs3-bxb <dig>  that expresses the recombinase gene to produce the 'tr' lines. upon site-specific excision of the recognition site-flanked dna, the tr <dig> plants were back crossed to wild type plants and the bc <dig> progeny screened for segregants that retain the excision event but lack the recombinase gene. lines positive for excision but negative for the recombinase gene were self-fertilized. to remove possible de novo recombinase expression contamination to the bc <dig> results the 'selfed' progeny  lines were analyzed as a final confirmation for germinal transmission. a similar strategy was employed in previous recombinase research on phic <dig>  <cit> .

target lines for bxb <dig> recombination
the target construct pn6-bxb <dig> was introduced into arabidopsis, and  <dig> hygromycin resistant lines were confirmed by pcr detection of a  <dig>  kb product that spans the recognition site-flanked stuffer region . of those,  <dig> pn6-bxb <dig> lines were propagated to the ta <dig> generation and examined by southern blot for single copy t-dna integration. ecori or bamhi each cuts once within the target t-dna . hybridization with a gusa probe of ecori or bamhi cleaved genomic dna should reveal a band size >  <dig>  kb, the length of the cleaved t-dna. a hybridizing band <  <dig>  kb would indicate integration of a truncated t-dna. from this analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> pn6-bxb <dig> plants were determined to contain a single copy of a likely complete t-dna  and designated ta2-bxb <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the  <dig>  kb pcr product from each of these lines was sequenced to confirm the presence of intact attp and attb sites .

arabidopsis oxs <dig> promoter for expression of bxb1
as previous research has demonstrated successful germline tissue expression of other recombinase genes  <cit> , we again chose the  <dig>  kb promoter fragment of the arabidopsis oxidative stress 3gene   <cit>  for bxb <dig> transgene expression and generated the plasmid construct pcoxs3-bxb <dig> .

secondary transformation of ta target lines
the ta <dig> generation of bxb <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> plant lines were transformed with agrobacterium harboring the pcoxs3-bxb <dig> vector producing the tr <dig> plant lines. kanamycin resistant transformants that exhibited a wild type appearance and growth rate were identified and grown in the greenhouse. three-week old tr <dig> transformants were tested for the presence of the bxb <dig> gene. pcr amplification by primers g and h  showed that a majority of the plants harbor the recombinase gene . the groups of plants that harbor the bxb <dig> gene were designated tr1-bxb <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

a primers g and h yielded the  <dig>  kb bxb <dig> fragment

b primers e and f yielded the  <dig>  and/or  <dig>  kb fragment

c primers e and f yielded the  <dig>  kb excision fragment

d primers e and f failed to detect a  <dig>  kb target fragment

the tr1-bxb <dig> lines were examined using histochemical staining to detect gusa encoded reporter gene activity. the tr1-bxb <dig> lines, however, exhibited variable levels of Î²-glucuronidase activity. one interpretation of this reduced activity is that the lines were undergoing low levels of bxb1-mediated excision, but pcr analysis of lines where gus activity was weak or undetectable were positive for excision of the target dna. given that the screening for gus activity was not a reliable indicator of bxb <dig> site-specific recombination, we subsequently utilized pcr to screen for site-specific excision.

with the  <dig> tr1-bxb <dig> ,  <dig> tr1-bxb <dig> ,  <dig> tr1-bxb <dig>  and  <dig> tr1-bxb <dig>  individuals, pcr with primers e and f  detected a  <dig>  kb product expected for site-specific excision . however, the  <dig>  kb product representing the parental configuration was also detected in some individuals, which indicates the presence of unexcised target dna. as each individual harbors an independent coxs3-bxb <dig> t-dna integration at a different genomic location, with perhaps a different copy number or structural arrangements, the incomplete excision in some individuals was likely due to variability in recombinase gene expression. based on the genomic pcr results, 35-89% of the bxb <dig> positive tr <dig> plants generated only the  <dig>  kb excision pcr product .

segregation of the bxb <dig> gene
to determine if the genomic excision event occurred in the germline tissue, we examined whether the excised target was heritably transmitted to the progeny lacking the bxb <dig> gene. this analysis also determines whether or not the excision reaction was generated de novo in each generation. individuals were chosen from each of the tr1-bxb <dig> , tr1-bxb <dig>  tr1-bxb <dig>  and tr1-bxb <dig>  families  to pollinate wild type recipients. the backcross progenies  were grown without selection and then screened by pcr for the target locus  and the recombinase gene , which reveals whether excision occurred  or not  and if bxb <dig> was present or absent. with the tr1-bxb <dig> , tr1-bxb <dig> , tr1-bxb <dig>  and tr1-bxb <dig> , 75% , 65% , 95%  and 73%  of the bc <dig> plants harbored the target dna, respectively .

a primers e and f yielded the  <dig>  and/or  <dig>  kb target fragment

b primers e and f yielded the  <dig>  kb excision fragment

c primers g and h failed to detect the  <dig>  kb bxb <dig> fragment

d primers g and h yielded the  <dig>  kb bxb <dig> fragment and primers e and f failed to detect the  <dig>  and/or  <dig>  kb target fragment

for the nine tr1-bxb <dig>  plants that were backcrossed, 77% of the progeny plants  that harbor the target locus showed excision of the attp and attb-flanked dna, with 21%  lacking the recombinase gene . of the tr1-bxb <dig>  plants, 61%  of target plants showed excision of the attp and attb-flanked target, and  <dig> %  lack the recombinase gene . a total of 87% of the tr1-bxb <dig>  plants  harbor the target locus with excision of the attp and attb-flanked dna, 24%  lack the recombinase gene . out of the ten tr1-bxb <dig>  plants that were backcrossed, 78% of the plants  that harbor the target locus showed excision of the attp and attb-flanked dna, with 16%  lacking the recombinase gene. the genomic excision  <dig>  kb pcr product from two representative individuals from each family was sequenced and examined for conservative recombination. all eight bxb1-mediated excision pcr products sequenced were conservative and site specific .

molecular confirmation of the bc <dig> progeny
bc <dig> plants that showed excision but lacked the recombinase gene were self-fertilized to generate progeny designated s1-bxb <dig>  pcr analysis on these plants confirmed the inheritance of the excision event in the absence of the bxb <dig> recombinase gene , which indicates germinal transmission. for further molecular confirmation, southern blot hybridization was conducted on two selected s <dig> individuals. the genomic dna was isolated and cleaved with ecorv, which is expected to liberate either a  <dig>  kb or a  <dig>  kb fragment from the non-recombined or recombined structure, respectively . the gus <dig> probe detected the  <dig>  kb band in the parental lines but not in the s <dig> plants . instead, only the  <dig>  kb band was observed for s <dig> plants from the tr1-bxb <dig> lineage. the genomic dna was also pcr amplified with primers g and h , which would generate a  <dig>  kb fragment if the genome were to harbor a coxs3-bxb <dig> t-dna. whole plant genomic dna was pcr amplified to ensure the absence of the bxb <dig> transgene since previous screening methods only used dna from individual leaves and could miss mosaic plants. amplification detected the bxb <dig> gene fragment in the parental control plants but not in the s <dig> plants, validating that these excision positive plants were recombinase negative .

we further isolated, by segregation, bxb <dig> recombinase expression lines for the purpose of crossing to the original ta <dig> target lines to determine if a genomic excision event could be facilitated using this alternative approach. two independent lines from each of three  secondary transformation events were isolated from segregating populations via pcr  and designated lines coxs3- <dig> ,  <dig> ; coxs3- <dig> ,  <dig>  and coxs3- <dig> ,  <dig> . recombinase expression lines were not isolated from the tr1-bxb <dig>  transformation event due to the apparent homozygosity of original ta3-bxb <dig>  target line . each of these six independently isolated lines was crossed to the original target line ta3-bxb <dig> . the manually crossed progenies  were grown without selection and screened by pcr for the target locus  and the recombinase gene . of the mc1-bxb <dig>  plants that carried both the target locus and bxb <dig> gene, 100%  of the tested individuals displayed the  <dig>  kb excision band in the absence of the unexcised  <dig>  kb target band when screened using pcr . of the mc1-bxb <dig>  plants with both the target and bxb <dig>  80%  generated only the  <dig>  kb excision pcr product . while 63%  of the mc1-bxb <dig>  individuals generated only the  <dig>  kb pcr product derived from an excised genomic target .

a primers e and f yielded the  <dig>  and/or  <dig>  kb target fragment

b primers g and h yielded the  <dig>  kb bxb <dig> fragment

c primers e and f yielded the  <dig>  kb excision fragment and primers g and h detect the  <dig>  kb bxb <dig> fragment

d primers e and f yielded the  <dig>  kb excision fragment and failed to detect a  <dig>  kb target fragment

discussion
this research investigated the bxb <dig> recombination system as a potential tool for the precise removal of plant transgenes. use of such technology potentially allows the production of crops with increased yield, resistance to key stresses like disease and drought  <cit> , improve bioenergy production, and new food products that provide valuable health benefits while eliminating the retention of unneeded "marker" genes. this in turn addresses concern relative to both human consumption and potential for transfer of these transgenes that confer antibiotic or herbicide resistance to organisms within the environment  <cit> . recombinase-mediated genetic engineering provides a favorable method for enhancing the precision of biotechnology allowing not only marker removal but also facilitating site-specific introduction of a transgene as a single copy into the genome thereby eliminating the random nature of conventional transgene integration. our interest in site-specific recombination lies in its ability to facilitate crop improvement through controlled engineering of the plant genome. the bxb <dig> serine recombinase has uni-directional recombination activity and has the capacity for excision, inversion and integration within the plant genome.

the strategy as initially designed was based on the assumption that we could use gusa expression as a reporter of site-specific recombination. the pattern of gus enzyme activity would reveal genomic excision of the target sequence and any tissue specificity in the observed recombination activity. this strategy, however, failed to perform as desired with initial excised plants having either weak gus staining or not producing any detectable Î²-glucuronidase activity. subsequent analysis of the original tr1-bxb <dig> progeny confirmed that use of reporter enzyme activity was an unreliable indicator of excision. we had also observed this phenomenon with other constructs used in both arabidopsis and s. pombe  <cit> . it is possible that the  <dig> bp attp/b hybrid sequence present within the transcript leader sequence of the gusa gene may cause poor expression due to methylation or by some other mechanism that inhibits gene expression. due to this circumstance, the analysis and scoring of site-specific excision were performed using pcr.

site-specific excision was detected in all tr1-bxb <dig> , tr1-bxb <dig> , tr1-bxb <dig>  and tr1-bxb <dig>  plants. the majority  of the plants containing excision of the target sequence were exclusively positive for the  <dig>  kb excision band in the absence of the  <dig>  kb unexcised target band. this suggests that efficient bxb1-mediated excision of the four target lines within the arabidopsis genome. indeed, when segregants derived from tr <dig> lines, containing only the bxb <dig> expression cassette were manually crossed with ta-bxb <dig>  target plants, 80%  of the progeny generated only the  <dig>  kb excised target pcr product, again independently demonstrating that bxb <dig> functions well in these plants. from analysis of the bc <dig> plants,  <dig> %  of those derived from the four tr1-bxb <dig> lines showed evidence of excision, while in a previous line of research  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the bc <dig> plants of the tr1-para, phic <dig> and cre lines, respectively exhibited excision  <cit> . by this measure, it appears that the native bxb <dig> recombinase mediated excision occurs with efficiency comparable to para and phic <dig> and approaching that of the cre-lox system. it is possible that through optimization and or the addition of a nuclear localization signal that bxb <dig> can be enhanced to even higher levels of activity in plants. although, the majority of the bc <dig> lines displayed excised genomic target, it is difficult to give a precise quantitative assessment of the bxb <dig> activity since only a modest number of different target locations were thoroughly characterized and direct comparison to other recombinases was not addressed. variability in copy number and chromosome locations of the bxb <dig> gene can affect the amount of recombinase protein produced and thus may impact the efficiency of the excision reaction observed, making a direct comparison difficult.

as an alternative method of recombinase introduction into the plant target lines, hand pollination between bxb <dig> recombinase expressing plants and pn6-bxb <dig> target plants was performed. pcr analysis of the manually crossed mc <dig> progeny demonstrated that this is a viable method for the generation of individuals with genomic target excision . however, it was observed that like secondary agrobacterium transformation with the recombinase expression cassette, the genomic excision results varied between lines . use of a demonstrated recombinase expression line such as coxs3- <dig>  enabled sufficient recombinase mediated excision events to excise all target dna when crossed together. it was also observed that segregation of the secondary agrobacterium transformed tr <dig> lines, without benefit of backcrossing, produced excised target and recombinase expression-only t-dna lines in the tr <dig> and tr <dig> generations . this indicates that the bxb <dig> expression t-dna in these lines was at a single locus or a low number loci within the genome and that expression was sufficient to facilitate recombination, allowing segregation by self-pollination.

since pcr assays of genomic dna from leaf tissue only indicates that excision has occurred in somatic cells, we utilized southern blot analysis to ascertain whether target sequence removal had occurred in the germline. as long as bxb <dig> dna was present in the genome, or the bxb <dig> protein was present in the germline cells, the possibility that recombination was generated de novo could not be ruled out. hence, bc <dig> plants were screened by pcr for the absence of the bxb <dig> recombinase gene, and the following generation  was confirmed by southern blot hybridization. as is shown in  germinal transmission of the genomic excision event in the absence of the bxb <dig> recombinase gene occurred, illustrating that the production of stable lines with the unwanted dna removed can be achieved.

precise genomic integration is another benefit of recombinase technology and allows the use of more sophisticated recombinase applications  <cit> . production of precisely controlled transgenic plants through site-specific integration has been reported to function in arabidopsis, tobacco and rice  <cit>  with cre, flp and r recombinase systems. the bxb <dig> recombinase with its uni-directional catalytic activity presents an alternative way to facilitate stable site-specific integration events without the elaborate strategies required by the bi-directional systems. peer-reviewed literature reported that bxb <dig> is capable of genome targeting in insect cells  <cit>  and targeted integration into the genome of tobacco  <cit> . utilization of bxb <dig> for genome modification could be facilitated through the identification of cryptic attp or attb sites as potential locations for transgene introduction as shown by work with phic <dig> in the mammalian genome  <cit> .

as our lab is interested in pursuing targeted integration using active 'cryptic' sites, we searched the arabidopsis thaliana genome for the presence of sequences similar to the bxb <dig> att sites. using blastn and fuzznuc http://embossgui.sourceforge.net/demo/fuzznuc.html searches we identified  <dig> arabidopsis sequences with > 60% nucleotide identity with the minimal  <dig> bp attp and  <dig> bp attb sites. a total of eighteen sequences had  <dig> or  <dig> matches  to the  <dig> bp attp sequence, while nine sequences had 27- <dig> nucleotides in common  with the  <dig> bp bxb <dig> attb sequence . while nine of these sequences contained the conserved central core "gt" sequence  required for bxb1-mediated recombination, most of these sequences did not . since the dinucleotide core of the bxb <dig> att sites is required for both homology matching and site orientation in the recombination reaction  <cit> , we repeated the bxb <dig> att-like sequence genome search using only the core sequence conserved between the attp and attb sites as the query . this second search identified nine sequences which contain only two mismatches compared to the conserved core att sequence. five of these sequences contained 50-56% overall identity with attp  and six with 50-62% overall identity with attb . most of these contained the required gt core sequence. two of these sequences , were among the most similar to both attp and attb sequences. next we mapped these  <dig> att-like sequences onto the five arabidopsis chromosomes. a diagram displaying the location and orientation of the att-like sequences is shown in . the closest directly oriented sites are located approximately  <dig> kb apart near the telomere of chromosome  <dig>  although both of these sequences have high overall identity with att sites , neither contains the conserved gt core sequence  making bxb1-mediated recombination highly unlikely. similarly, there are no instances in the genome where attp- and attb-like sequences both contain the central dinucleotide "gt" and occur in direct orientation on the same chromosome . taken together, the limited overall sequence similarity to attp and attb, the lack of the required central "gt" within most of the att-like sequences, and their dispersed chromosomal location within the genome, suggest that the potential for bxb1-mediated recombination of endogenous arabidopsis sequences within the genome is quite low. consistent with this observation, the oxs <dig> promoter-bxb <dig> transgenic plants did not exhibit compromised viability, morphological or growth defects like was observed earlier for 35s-phic <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants which commonly exhibited crinkled leaves  <cit> . the presence of such phenotypic aberrations clearly indicate the importance of utilizing controlled recombinase transgene expression with the appropriate use of promoters.

CONCLUSIONS
this research demonstrates that the bxb <dig> recombinase successfully performs site-specific genome modification in arabidopsis germline tissue. plants actively expressing the bxb <dig> transgene appeared phenotypically normal with seed set equivalent to wild type, suggesting that there are no detrimental impacts from constitutive expression. the excision events produced by bxb <dig> were conservative site-specific deletions of the attp and attb-flanked dna from the plant genome. in a majority  of the transgenic lines examined, at least one bc <dig> segregant was recovered that contained a germinally transmitted excision event lacking the bxb <dig> transgene. these results were molecularly validated with dna blot hybridization and show that the secondary transformation strategy used in this study can be utilized to generate marker gene-free transgenic plants. this type of approach will be particularly useful in plants where cross pollination is either not possible or undesirable. in addition, we show that an alternative approach to marker gene removal using cross pollination between recombinase expressing and att-flanked target containing transgenic lines is also a viable strategy. therefore, taken together the results clearly illustrate that the bxb1-att system performs genomic excision removing unwanted dna to generate stable recombinase-free arabidopsis transgenic plants.
