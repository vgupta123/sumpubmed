BACKGROUND
polyhydroxyalkanoates  are aliphatic polyesters biosynthesized by several bacteria  <cit>  as a means of carbon storage and a source of reducing equivalents when other nutrients are limiting. the most frequently pha produced is poly or phb  <cit> . the ability to produce phb has been correlated with improved survival under stress conditions or in competitive environments  <cit> . phb is generally produced in conditions of carbon oversupply and low levels of other nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphate or oxygen  <cit> . the biosynthesis of phb is dependent on the activity of the following enzymes:  a 3-ketothiolase which condenses two acetyl-coa yielding acetoacetyl-coa ,  a nadph-dependent acetoacetyl-coa reductase which reduces acetoacetyl-coa to -3-hydroxybutyryl-coa  and  the phb synthase  that catalyses the polymerization of -3-hydroxybutyryl-coa to form the polymer  <cit> . this polymer is stored intracellularly as insoluble inclusion bodies called phb granules  <cit>  which also contain about 2% protein as well as phospholipids  <cit> . the main protein associated with the phb granules is phasin  which prevents coalescence of phb granules by coating the granule surfaces  <cit> . however, other proteins have also been found associated with the granules, including transcriptional regulators such as phaf from pseudomonas oleovorans gpo <dig>  phar from paracoccus denitrificans, and phar from ralstonia eutropha h <dig>  <cit> .

expression of enzymes involved in pha/phb biosynthesis and the granule-associated phasin are reported to be regulated at the transcriptional level  <cit> . this regulation may include repressors as well as activators  <cit> . the proteins phbr from azotobacter vinelandii uw <dig>  <cit>  and phad from pseudomonas putida kt <dig>  <cit>  are transcription activators. in contrast, phar of p. denitrificans represses phar expression by binding to a tgc rich region which overlaps the -35/- <dig> promoter  <cit> . in r. eutropha h <dig> the phar protein binds to the -35/- <dig> phap promoter at two sites: the transcriptional start site and upstream from the - <dig> at the promoter region, thereby blocking rna polymerase  <cit> . the phar binding site determined in r. eutropha comprises two  <dig> bp repeated sequences not related to those observed in p. denitrificans, suggesting that dna-binding sites for phar recognition and the mechanisms of regulation may vary.

the β-proteobacterium herbaspirillum seropedicae smr <dig> is a plant-endophytic diazotroph found in association with economically important graminaceous species such as sugar cane, sorghum, rice and maize  <cit> . h. seropedicae smr <dig> has been already described as a phb producer using glucose as carbon source  <cit> , however the molecular aspects of its phb metabolism have not been addressed. the h. seropedicae smr <dig> genome sequence analysis indicated several genes likely to be involved in phb metabolism, including, phba, phbb and phbc encoding for 3-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-coa reductase and poly synthase. the phbf gene encoding a putative regulator was located downstream from phbcb  <cit> . in this work we characterized the transcriptional regulator phbf of herbaspirillum seropedicae smr <dig>

phb granule-binding of the his-phbf protein
the phb granule-binding reaction was performed as described  <cit>  with modifications. his-phbf  was incubated with  <dig> mg of purified h. seropedicae smr <dig> phb granules in a final volume of  <dig> μl in  <dig> mmol/l tris-hcl ph  <dig> . samples were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> minutes and then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minute. the supernatant was collected and the granules were washed twice with  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig>  and the supernatant from each wash step was also collected separately. protein bound to the granules was dissociated by incubation in 2%  sds, 10%  glycerol and 5%  β-mercaptoethanol at 90°c for five minutes. samples were analyzed by sds-page  <cit> .

RESULTS
the h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf protein was first identified in the cellular proteome by  <cit>  using late log phase culture grown under ammoniotrophic conditions. the phbf gene  is located downstream from phbc and phbb  and encodes a  <dig> amino acids protein with high similarity to r. eutropha h <dig> phar   <cit> , and, to a lesser extent, to rhodobacter sphaeroides fj <dig>  and p. denitrificans phar . in silico analysis indicated a helix-turn-helix motif located at its n-terminal sequence suggesting that phbf is capable of dna-binding and may act as a regulator of phb biosynthesis genes in h. seropedicae smr <dig> 

to characterize the h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf protein, it was overexpressed and purified as a his-tag fusion form  from e. coli bl <dig> harboring the plasmid pkado <dig> . most of the expressed his-phbf was found in the soluble protein fraction when cells were induced at low temperature  and lysed in buffer containing triton x- <dig>  <dig> % . this detergent at low concentration yielded a homogenous his-phbf protein solution of 98% purity by ni2+-affinity chromatography. circular dichroism analysis indicated that purified his-phbf is folded in the presence of the detergent . also, gel filtration chromatography indicated that h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf is tetrameric in solution with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig>  kda . the phar from p. denitrificans is also a tretrameric protein of approximately  <dig> kda in solution  <cit> .

twelve putative promoter regions were identified by dna sequence analyses of genes potentially involved in pha metabolism in h. seropedicae smr <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  all of these putative promoter regions, with the exception of phap <dig>  were assayed for dna binding by his-phbf. dna band-shift assays showed that purified his-phbf was able to bind specifically to these eleven promoter regions  but not to the unrelated nifb promoter  <cit>  indicating that the protein is active. the apparent dissociation constants observed varied from  <dig> nm  to  <dig> nm .

these twelve promoter regions  were also analyzed in silico using the meme program  <cit>  which indicated the sequence tgtgc3gcaa as a probable dna-binding motif for phbf . a similar sequence  was also described in r. sphaeroides fj <dig> as the dna-binding site for the regulator phar  <cit> . both sequences show two highly conserved triplets  which seem to be essential for dna-binding of r. sphaeroides phar  <cit> .

to verify if the tgtgc3gcaa sequence is important for dna-binding of h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf, a dnasei footprinting assay was performed using the phbf promoter region and purified his-phbf . a clear dnasei protection site was observed when his-phbf was present in the assay. the protected site covers positions  <dig> to  <dig> upstream from the translation start site indicating that his-phbf binds to a  <dig> bp region of its own promoter which includes the conserved tgtgc3gcaa motif indicated by the meme program, reinforcing the suggestion that it is the dna site recognized by the h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf. furthermore, a putative sigma 70-dependent promoter was also identified upstream from the phbf dna-binding site  . the proximity of both sites also suggests that h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf may repress its own expression.

we verified the potential repressor activity of phbf in e. coli et <dig> by using a gene reporter expression assay with phap <dig> and phbf promoters fused to the lacz gene. these genes were chosen because they have the putative phbf-binding sequence highly similar to the consensus sequence, and also because emsa assay showed clear interaction with these promoters. the β-galactosidase activities indicated that both phap <dig> and phbf promoters were functional in e. coli . however, a clear decrease in β-galactosidase activity is observed if h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf is present , indicating that phbf represses the expression of the phasin gene  and also of its own gene promoter . expression of an unrelated protein  did not affect β-galactosidase activity of e. coli bearing the phbf::lacz and phap1::lacz fusions , reinforcing the repressor effect of phbf.

protein domain analysis indicated that phbf contains a dna-binding motif and a domain possibly involved in binding phb. therefore, we tested if h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf was able to interact with phb granules in vitro. the purified his-phbf was incubated with phb granules extracted from h. seropedicae smr <dig> and the protein remaining in solution was visualized by sds-page . when his-phbf was incubated with phb granules most of the protein was extracted from solution . the protein remained bound to the granule even after two washing steps , and was released only after heating in the presence of sds, indicating a strong interaction between his-phbf and phb.

our results indicate that h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf is capable of dna binding and also of associating with phb granules. in addition, expression of phbf from h. seropedicae smr <dig> leads to  <dig> and 4-fold reduction  in expression of phbf and phap <dig> promoters, respectively. these results strongly suggest that h. seropedicae smr <dig> phbf protein is a repressor which controls expression of genes involved in phb production as well its own expression. in both respects it shows similarity with the phar regulator from r. eutropha  <cit>  and from p. denitrificans  <cit> .

the expression of phbf gene in h. seropedicae smr <dig> increases sharply in the log phase  and phb starts to accumulate in the log phase reaching maximum as the culture entry in the stationary phase  <cit> , suggesting that the repressor activity of phbf may be relieved as phb oligomers levels increase inside the cell, as suggested in r. eutropha and p. denitrificans  <cit> . the expression of phap <dig> has a similar pattern. we hypothesize that when phb oligomers levels increase, the phbf protein is sequestred, allowing transcriptional initiation. whether phbf can be released from dna by binding to phb, thus allowing expression of pha/phb genes once phb synthesis is favored is not known.

the production of reserve material such as phb has important metabolic features, since stress endurance and survival is improved when bacteria produce phb, as observed for azospirillum brasilense  <cit> , and cells with high phb content were able to increase the population 2- <dig> fold and survive for longer periods of starvation as seen in sinorhizobium meliloti  <cit> . therefore, knowledge of the phb metabolism of plant-associated bacteria may contribute to the understanding of the colonization process and improvement of their resistance and survival under colonizing conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that phbf from h. seropedicae smr <dig> binds to eleven promoter regions of genes related to phb metabolism. a dna-binding consensus sequence was determined and confirmed by dnase-i footprinting assay. furthermore, expression of phbf::lacz and phap1::lacz fusions indicated that phbf may act as a transcriptional repressor of genes involved in phb metabolism in h. seropedicae smr <dig>
