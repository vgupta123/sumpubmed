BACKGROUND
art <dig> is structurally related to vertebrate ecto-adp-ribosyltransferases , which covalently modify extracellular substrates by transferring a single adp-ribose residue from nad+ to a specific amino acid in the target protein  <cit> .

the mammalian art family which comprises five members  has been extensively studied in mice and humans  <cit> . in contrast to humans, which lack art <dig> expression due to the presence of a non-functional art <dig> gene  <cit> , two art <dig> proteins are expressed in mice as a result of gene duplication  <cit> . among the five known arts, only art <dig>  art <dig> and art <dig> exhibit arginine-specific enzyme activity. art <dig> and art <dig> appear to have lost their catalytic activity, most likely due to the non-conservative substitution of residues in the r-s-exe motif, which is typically present in the active centre of arginine-specific arts  <cit> .

so far, no evidence for a potential other function has emerged for either of the two "acatalytic" members of the mammalian art family, except that human art <dig> has previously been demonstrated to be identical with the polymorphic dombrock blood group antigen expressed on erythrocytes as gpi -anchored glycoprotein  <cit> . in addition, we and others have shown that expression of the human art <dig> gene can be induced by lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan in monocytes and alveolar epithelial cells  <cit> .

given the fact that the art <dig> gene locus shows considerable genetic variation even among mammalian species , we sought to employ bioinformatic means to search for other art <dig> orthologues not only in mammals but also in lower vertebrates. a tblastn search, in which the amino acid sequence of human art <dig> was compared to entries in ncbi's nucleotide sequence databases dynamically translated in all reading frames, resulted in the detection of a predicted gene transcript in chicken that potentially encoded a protein "similar to dombrock blood group carrier molecule". intriguingly, this protein contained an intact r-s-exe motif, which raised the possibility that it represented an active art enzyme. as none of the arts identified in chicken so far  <cit>  was evolutionary related to mammalian arts, it was important to verify the orthologous relationship between the putative chicken and the human art <dig> gene, before attempting to prove the enzymatic activity of its protein.

here we report for the first time the existence of a gpi-anchored art <dig> in chicken, which, to our knowledge, represents also the first real orthologue of a member of the mammalian ecto-art family in a non-mammalian species. moreover, in contrast to its mammalian art <dig> orthologues, chicken art <dig> displays an arginine-specific mono-adp-ribosyltransferase activity.

RESULTS
identification of an art4-related gene in chicken
in order to locate art4-related genes in species other than mammals, we made use of the tblastn program, which compares a protein query sequence to nucleotide sequences dynamically translated in all six reading frames. a search of the national center for biotechnology information  "nr" nucleotide database with the human or mouse art <dig> protein sequence uncovered a putative chicken gene transcript of  <dig> nucleotides that translated into a  <dig> amino acid protein "similar to dombrock blood group carrier molecule" . this record had been generated by "automated computational analysis" of a genomic contig  on chicken chromosome  <dig>  which resulted in the prediction of an art4-related gene composed of three coding exons. as in mammalian art <dig> genes, the second exon encoded the major part of the protein, but different from the situation in mammals, it also coded for an intact r-s-exe motif indicative of a functional catalytic domain of an arginine-specific adp-ribosyltransferase  <cit> . incidentally,  was since removed from the "nr" database and on 06-nov- <dig> replaced by .  to substantiate the presence of an active art4-related gene in chicken, rt-pcr was performed on total rna from hd <dig> cells  with primers, designed to amplify the complete coding and additional flanking sequences of the trancript shown in . a weak pcr-product of approx.  <dig> base pairs was obtained . it corresponded to the transcript predicted in the original  entry, thus, verifying the existence of an avian art gene with three coding exons as found in mammalian art <dig> genes. using the blastp program  <cit>  to compare the amino acid sequence of the chicken protein with that of each member of the art family in men and mice, the highest degree of sequence identity exhibited the art <dig> orthologues, with 47% identity and 65% similarity between chicken and human or 45% identity and 64% similarity between chicken and mouse . figure 2a shows the actual amino acid sequence alignment of the putative chicken art <dig> with its presumed counterparts in mouse and man. as noted before, only the chicken protein contains an intact r-s-exe motif. note that in all three arts the x within the exe tripeptide is a lysine .

phylogentic relatedness of art <dig> in chicken and mammals
having demonstrated the existence of an apparently art4-related gene in the chicken genome, we wanted to establish its phylogenetic relatedness with mammalian genes by analysing its location on chromosome  <dig> with respect to the presence and order of genes surrounding it. employing ncbi's map viewer  and tblastn searches revealed that the chicken gene mapped to a region syntenic to the portion on human chromosome  <dig>  which harbours the human art <dig> gene . the analysed 83-kb gallus gallus locus comprises seven genes in addition to art <dig>  six of these genes were also found surrounding the human art <dig> locus, whereas the gene  directly upstream of chicken art <dig> had no human counterpart . the data presented so far strongly suggest that the predicted chicken gene is orthologous to mammalian art <dig> genes.

analysis of the 5' and 3' untranslated region
to analyse the 5' end of the chicken art <dig> mrna we performed 5' inverse race-pcr on rna derived from yolk sack. among the respective pcr products we obtained a product of  <dig> bp . according to the sequence analysis of the product  which includes exon  <dig> and parts of exon  <dig> the 5' utr consists of  <dig> bp.

the 3' utr of the chicken art <dig> mrna was analysed by applying 3' inverse race-pcr  <cit>  or 3' race-pcr  <cit>  on mrna from hd <dig> cells using primers derived from the predicted art <dig> sequence. as no art <dig> specific transcripts were obtained, possibly due to the length of the products we applied conventional rt-pcr analysis to amplify art <dig> mrna reaching into the 3' utr as far as possible. we obtained a pcr product  of  <dig> bp  consisting mainly of exon  <dig> and to a minor extent of exon  <dig>  it contains three obviously unused polyadenylation signals. in a subsequent 3' race-pcr analysis using primers derived from the above described pcr product we detected a transcript , representing the 3' end of the chicken art <dig> mrna.

chicken art <dig> is a gpi-anchored and glycosylated protein
c-33a cells were stably transfected with an expression plasmid containing the sequence of art <dig> encoding amino acids 20– <dig>  as shown by facs analysis about 30% of the stably transfected cells were fluorescence positive . treatment with pi-plc resulted in a significant decrease from 30% to  <dig> % positive cells, indicating the existence of a gpi-anchored protein. proteins of the supernatant of the pi-plc treated c-33a cells were separated by sds-page and art <dig> was detected by western blot analysis. the apparent molecular weight was  <dig> kda, about  <dig> kda higher than predicted . as chicken art <dig> contains five potential n-glycosylation sites we tested whether the higher mass could be due to glycosylation of the protein. we incubated the chicken art <dig> containing supernatant with pngase f, an enzyme that cleaves the amide bonds between glcnac and asparagine residues of n-linked glycoproteins  <cit> . the molecular weight of art <dig> detected in the supernatant by western blot analysis was about  <dig> kda lower than the untreated protein , indicating the presence of asparagine-linked glycosyl moieties on chicken art <dig>  after having probed the membrane with the anti-flag m <dig> antibody, the membrane was stained with ponceau s. as seen in figure 4d there was hardly any difference between the molecular weight of chicken art <dig> and pngase f. however, the anti-flag antibody only detected chicken art <dig> so that any unspecific binding of the antibody to pngase f can be excluded.

chicken art <dig> is enzymatically active
in contrast to human art <dig> the chicken art <dig> contains the r-s-exe motif, a characteristic for arginine-specific arts  <cit> . art <dig> activity was measured by incubating art <dig> transfected c-33a cells with etheno-nad+, an analogue of nad+. etheno-nad+ can be used as an alternative substrate to monitor etheno-adp-ribosylation of cell surface proteins. the etheno-adp-ribosylated proteins were visualized by flow cytometry using an etheno-adenosine specific antibody   <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  transient transfection of c-33a cells with chicken art <dig> leads to an adp-ribosylation of cell surface proteins . transfection efficiency was monitored by staining the cells with an anti-flag antibody . about 14% of the cells were art <dig> positive and about 18% carried adp-ribosylated proteins. as seen in figure 5e adp-ribosylated proteins are also detectable on chicken erythrocytes indicating that adp-ribosylation is not only mediated by recombinant art <dig> but also occurs endogenously.

to characterize the nature of the linkage between adp-ribose and amino acid side chains cells were incubated in the presence of etheno-nad+. cell lysates were prepared and incubated under conditions known to cleave specifically the linkage of adp-ribose to thiol groups , or to arginine   <cit> . sds-page followed by western blot analysis using the 1g <dig> antibody  <cit>  revealed that detection by the antibody was not influenced by treatment with  <dig> m nacl  and  <dig> mm hgcl <dig>  but was abolished in the presence of  <dig> m nh2oh  strongly suggesting that chicken art4-catalyzed mono-adp-ribosylation occurred at arginine residues. as a loading control, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with a β-actin specific antibody .

to verify that arginine-residues were modified by chicken art <dig>  adp-ribosylation of poly-l-arginine was determined by incubating chicken art <dig> in the presence of -nad+, adp-ribose and poly-l-arginine. adp-ribose was added to minimize the contribution of the non-enzymatic addition of free -adp-ribose to poly-l-arginine.

the finding that radioactivity was incorporated in poly-l-arginine  demonstrates that art <dig> catalyzed mono-adp-ribosylation occurred at arginine residues.

to further characterize chicken art <dig> the km value of the enzyme was determined. recombinant chart <dig> was used for time- and dose-dependent determinations of enzymatic activity. lineweaver-burk analysis revealed an apparent km for etheno-nad+ of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  of recombinant chart <dig> . treatment of the protein with pngase f resulted in a decrease in the km value  which was not significantly different from the km value of the untreated protein .

mutation of the active site motif of human art4
to test whether human art <dig> containing an r-s-exe motif is enzymatically active three mutant proteins were constructed and tested for adp-ribosyltransferase activity using etheno-nad+ as substrate. expression plasmids were generated which encoded for the wildtype art <dig>  an y187r mutant, a k242e mutant, and an y187r, k242e double mutant containing the r-s-exe motif. c-33a cells were stably transfected with the plasmids and those cells carrying either the wildtype art <dig>  the single mutants or the double mutant were enriched by cell sorting  and used for further analyses. facs-analysis revealed that neither the mutants carrying a single amino acid exchange nor the double mutant  displayed any enzyme activity . obviously additional residues besides the intact r-s-exe motif are involved in catalyzing the enzymatic reaction.

tissue distribution of chicken art4
quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis of chicken tissues revealed that the highest amount of chicken art <dig> mrna was present in spleen, liver and bone marrow, while in thymus, bursa of fabricius, and caecum it was hardly detected. no mrna was detected in lung .

discussion
whereas most studies have focussed on art genes and activity in mammals expression of arts has also been demonstrated in chicken. chicken contain both soluble arts  and gpi-anchored arts . the nucleotide sequence of cgart <dig> was found to be identical with that of art <dig>  and the cdna of cgart <dig> encoded a polypeptide which represents an art <dig> homologue   <cit> . the gpi-anchored arts showed different enzymatic properties than soluble arts and the tissue distribution of cgart <dig> and cgart <dig> revealed distinct expression patterns  <cit> . besides art <dig> and art <dig> no other arts have been identified in chicken so far. here we show that apart from art <dig> and art <dig> chicken also express a non chicken-specific art.

we describe the cloning and characterization of the art <dig>  gene from gallus gallus. several lines of evidence, such as conserved synteny, similar exon-intron structure, and conserved residues show that the gene cloned is the gallus gallus orthologue of the human art <dig> gene. the predicted chicken art <dig> amino acid sequence only shares 47% and 45% identity  to human and mouse art <dig> respectively and among mammals art <dig> also appears to be quite divergent with an identity between human and mouse art <dig> of 63% . thus the coding sequence of art <dig> appears to be evolving rapidly. residues that are conserved during evolution in such a rapidly evolving gene or gene family are likely to be important for the function of the protein.

the amino acid sequence alignment of art <dig> from chicken, men, and mice uncovered several stretches of residues that are highly conserved, most strikingly the s30fddqy <dig> and k218evlippye <dig> residues . parts of these sequences namely the fdd and evlip motifs are also strictly conserved within other members of the art family. the fdd sequence motif is located in the n-terminus of the arts whereas the evlip stretch resides in the 5th of the six conserved β-strands that make up part of the core features of the art fold in the catalytic domain. moreover a lysine residue  directly upstream of the catalytic e in the exe motif is found in art <dig> of men , mice , and chicken  but not in the exe motif of other mammalian arts  <cit> .

another common feature of the chicken and human art <dig> gene is their genomic organization. almost the complete mature protein is encoded by exon  <dig>  one of the three exons that besides two introns make up the art <dig> gene  <cit> . unlike human art <dig> mrna the 3' utr of the chicken art <dig> mrna comprises  <dig> bp. due to this length the chicken art <dig> gene overlaps with a hypothetical gene  located on the opposite dna strand.

the tissue distribution of chicken art <dig> mrna expression is in part similar to that of human art <dig> mrna  <cit> . haematological tissues including human fetal liver and human and chicken bone marrow and spleen seem to be preferential sites of art <dig> mrna expression. furthermore, the fact that hel cells, a human erythroleukaemia cell line  <cit>  and human erythrocytes carry the art <dig> protein and that art <dig> mrna is present in chicken erythrocytes  may point to a role of art <dig> in haematopoiesis in higher vertebrates.

gpi-anchoring of the chicken art <dig> to the membrane was shown by pi-plc sensitivity. treatment of chicken art <dig> transfected c-33a cells with the enzyme led to the appearance of a  <dig> kda protein  whose molecular weight was higher than that predicted for chicken art <dig>  lacking the n- and c-terminal signal peptides. the decrease in molecular weight after the exposure to pngase f strongly suggests that the chicken art <dig> is glycosylated. in fact there are five predicted n-glycosylation sites in the amino acid sequence .

determination of the apparent km for etheno-nad+ of recombinant chicken art <dig> revealed a value of  <dig>  μm. it is similar to the km  for etheno-nad+ of art <dig>  expressed on dc <dig>  cells  <cit>  but it differs from the km values for recombinant art <dig>    <cit>  another art found in chicken and pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin a   <cit> .

interestingly, both human and chicken art <dig> contain an rgd sequence motif. this sequence  found in various adhesive proteins  serves as a cell attachment site  <cit> . in chicken the motif  is found in the n-terminal part of art <dig> whereas in humans an rgd <dig> motif is located in the c-terminus that aligns to the chicken rgn <dig>  in case art <dig> should display adhesive properties it would be of interest in how far the cell recognition signal arg-gly-asp is involved in it.

we show that chicken art <dig> contains residues corresponding to the r-s-exe active site motif of arginine-specific arts  <cit>  and that it displays arginine-specific enzyme activity while human art <dig> shows nonconservative amino acid deviations in this motif. furthermore, according to the clustal w amino acid sequence alignment human and mouse art <dig> not only deviate in the glutamic acid  two residues upstream of the catalytic glutamic acid  of the r-s-exe motif but also in the arginine  which is replaced by histidine  in mouse and tyrosine  in men .

considering the importance of the r-s-exe motif in the catalytic core of all arginine modifying arts we exchanged two amino acids of the human art <dig> y-s-kxe motif to obtain an intact r-s-exe motif. surprisingly c-33a cells expressing human art <dig> with the r-s-exe motif did not display any enzyme activity. obviously the mere presence of the correct motif in art <dig> is not sufficient to turn the protein into an active enzyme. further mutational studies are necessary to identify additional amino acid residues essential for restoring a functional catalytic core.

it is conceivable that the common ancestor of birds and mammals possesses an enzymatically active art <dig> and that the loss of enzyme activity of human art <dig> may have arisen due to some evolutionary advantages.

having cloned and characterized an enzymatically active art <dig> orthologue we have provided important experimental tools to elucidate the functional role of art <dig>  knowledge of such function in turn may help to explain the loss of art <dig> enzyme activity in mammals during evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
mono-adp-ribosyltransferases  catalyze the transfer of a single adp-ribose moiety of nad+ to a specific amino acid in a target protein. mammalian arts consist of five members  two of them art <dig> and art <dig> being enzymatically inactive, unlike the active members they do not contain the r-s-exe motif in the catalytic domain typical of arginine-specific adp-ribosyltransferases. here we identified the chicken art <dig> as the first real orthologue of a member of the mammalian arts in a non-mammalian species. in contrast to the mammalian art <dig> the chicken art <dig> contains an intact r-s-exe motif and exhibits the predicted enzyme activity. thus, art <dig> is the first adp-ribosyltransferase which displays different biochemical properties in two higher vertebrate classes.
