BACKGROUND
the study of the interactions of animals with their beneficial or mutualistic bacterial partners is a frontier field with a vast array of largely unanswered questions. a major subset of such associations, e.g., those of mammals, comprises the horizontally transmitted partnerships, i.e., associations in which the host and symbiont population or community re-establishes the relationship with each new host generation  <cit> . for this specific array of partnerships, some principal questions include: how are the bacterial partners harvested from the environment? in associations with consortia of bacteria, who are the naturally coevolved symbionts, or residents, and who are the 'tourists'? what factors mediate partner recognition and specificity? how do the partners impact one anothers' developmental programs? how is stability of the association achieved so that the bacterial partners are not eliminated nor are they allowed to overgrow host tissues? what are the principal similarities and differences in the mechanisms underlying beneficial and pathogenic interactions?

biologists know little about beneficial animal-bacterial relationships principally because of technological impediments, many of which have been alleviated by advances in molecular biology and biotechnology. these technological breakthroughs have poised the community of biologists to address the above-mentioned questions. specifically, large-scale sequencing efforts are allowing biologists to define the communities associated with particular animal species , and development of such methods as microarray analyses are enabling biologists to determine host and symbiont responses under natural and experimental conditions  <cit> .

in addition to these technological advances, the development of powerful models for the study of animal-bacterial interactions has been essential. as in developmental biology, the study of a wide variety of models will shed light on evolutionarily conserved mechanisms as well as the basis of diversity. to this end, two principal, complementary model types are under investigation: those using germ-free or gnotobiotic animals and binary associations. most notably for the former, gordon and coworkers have been experimentally manipulating germ-free, gnotobiotic and 'conventionalized'  zebrafish and mice to characterize interactions with their microbial partners  <cit> . these studies have revealed that the diverse community of microbiota in the vertebrate gut has profound effects on the gene expression, anatomy and physiology of the host animals . binary associations, i.e., those composed on one host species and a population of one microbial species, occur most often in invertebrate animals and offer relatively simple experimental systems for the study of animal-microbe relationships  <cit> .

the association between the hawaiian sepiolid squid euprymna scolopes and its luminous bacterial partner vibrio fischeri is a binary model system that has been under investigation for the last fifteen years . the relationship, in which the symbiont lives extracellularly in crypts of the light organ, begins in the hours after the juvenile host hatches from the egg. during embryogenesis, the host develops a nascent light organ that promotes specific colonization by v. fischeri . once light organ tissues have been colonized, development of the partners is induced . the bacterial symbiont triggers an elaborate developmental program in the host animal that leads to the transformation of the organ from an anatomy, physiology and biochemistry that promotes infection to one that fosters the functioning of the mature, bioluminescent organ. likewise, the bacterial partner transforms its biology from that characteristic of its niche in the bacterioplankton to that of its niche as a luminous bacterial symbiont.

in developing the squid-vibrio model, researchers in the field have sought not only to describe the nature of the system, from both the host and symbiont sides of the association, but also to apply new tools, as they became available, for its study. specifically, early efforts resulted in the development of genetics in the bacterial symbiont  <cit>  and, more recently, the annotated sequence of the v. fischeri genome has become available  <cit> . the collaborative work presented here describes the first efforts to generate bioinformatics tools for the host side of the squid-vibrio association. our goal was to define a representative set of host genes expressed in the juvenile light organ during the early developmental stages. to this end, we generated  <dig> cdna libraries derived from expressed sequences tags  isolated from three developmentally significant time points in the squid-vibrio system. this approach has been successfully used in the past to identify the set of transcribed genes specific to an organ or tissue of a particular organism . the generation of these resources paves the way for an in-depth examination of the influence of symbiosis in host gene expression in the squid-vibrio system.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> cdna libraries  were generated from  <dig> pools of squid light organ rna, containing clones with insert sizes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb and an average length of ~ <dig> kb. from these cdna libraries, sequencing generated a total of  <dig>  3' est sequences with an average sequence length of  <dig> bp and an average phred value of  <dig> . an overall novelty of greater than 45% remained throughout the sequencing phases of the non-normalized, normalized and subtracted libraries .

of the  <dig>  ests generated,  <dig>  ests satisfied the quality criteria . from the sequences that passed the quality criteria 97%  contained a polyadenylation tail. of those sequences with a polyadenylation tail, 63%  contained a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence , and another 15%  contained an alternative polyadenylation signal sequence <cit> . in silico comparison of these  <dig>  ests to sequences from the v. fischeri genome showed no sequence similarity, suggesting neither contaminating v. fischeri sequence nor evidence for horizontal gene transfer.

these  <dig>  ests were divided into  <dig>  unique clusters using the uicluster program. one sequence from each cluster was chosen to be a part of a nonredundant set of ests. within this set of clusters,  <dig>  contained at least one sequence with a polyadenylation tail and  <dig>  of these also contained a polyadenylation signal sequence. five prime sequences with an average length of  <dig> bp were generated from these nonredundant representative sequences from each cluster. of these sequences, 58%  of  <dig>  ests contained sufficient overlapping paired 3' and 5' sequences to form contigs with an average sequence length of  <dig>  bp. these contigs were used in place of the individual 3' and 5' sequences in further analyses when available. representative 3' and 5' sequences from the final non-redundant set of ests were deposited in the dbest division of genbank.

the blast annotation of the nonredundant set  showed that 70%  had a significant hit to a protein in the ncbi nonredundant protein database with an e-value threshold of e- <dig> . of these significant hits, 62%  hit an annotated known protein, 29%  hit a hypothetical protein and 9%  hit an unknown protein. of the remaining 30% without a significant blast hit, nearly half, 46% , may represent novel sequences because there was no hit to the non-redundant database.

using the david program, go terms for biological process, molecular function and cellular component were associated with 75%  of the  <dig>  ests that hit with an annotated protein in the ncbi database . of these  <dig>  ests, 78%  have an associated biological process description, 90%  have an associated molecular function description, and 65%  have an associated cellular component description.

of the  <dig>  ests, the largest number of ests  was found to be specific to the 48-h symbiotic library and this number is nearly twice the number found to be specific from any other library . in addition, 29%  of the  <dig>  ests are sequences derived from only aposymbiotic libraries  and 34%  are derived from only symbiotic libraries .

cluster analysis also revealed that 55%  of  <dig>  clusters are singleton clusters  and of these, 37%  are associated with a known protein, 23%  with a hypothetical protein, and 7%  with an unknown protein at an e-value threshold of e- <dig>  of the singleton clusters, 16%  do not have a blast hit and may be novel. in the set of clusters containing more than  <dig> est, 52%  are associated with a known protein, 17%  hit with a hypothetical protein, and 6%  match with an unknown protein at an e-value threshold of e- <dig>  of the remaining 45%  of clusters containing two or more ests, 12%  do not have a blast hit. although most of these clusters are represented by two or three ests, more than a quarter are composed of at least four ests with one cluster of  <dig> ests.

the similarity of e. scolopes sequences to those of three animals that are commonly studied but distantly related to e. scolopes, homo sapiens, drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans, were determined using a blast-based analysis with an e-value threshold of e- <dig>  the goal of this analysis was to perform a comparative genomic analysis through identification of orthologous genes. this is an alternate strategy which is based on gene content as opposed to a traditional molecular phylogeny analysis which is based on gene sequence. we evaluated several genes using the phylip package  with indeterminate results <cit> . the results of these analyses indicate the squid ests have the greatest number of genes with similarity only to h. sapiens genes with  <dig> %  of the  <dig>  annotated human sequences, compared to  <dig> %  of the  <dig>  annotated sequences reported in d. melanogaster and  <dig> %  of the  <dig>  annotated sequences reported in c. elegans . these data show a higher number of squid genes homologous to a deuterostome chordate, h. sapiens, than to two members of the ecdysozoa, the arthropod d. melanogaster and the nematode c. elegans.

to assess characteristics of the untranslated region and codon usage, a blast search was performed between the swissprot amino acid databases and the assembled contigs. a total of 8%  of the  <dig>  assembled contigs contained a blast hit of at least e- <dig> with a stop consistent with the carboxy terminus of at least one protein . this same analysis estimated an average 3' utr length of  <dig> bp. this estimate is conservative as genes with a utr longer than the average contig length of  <dig>  bp may not have a blast hit. these same utr predictions were used to estimate the gc content in the coding sequence compared to the untranslated sequence. a bias in gc content was observed between the coding and non-coding sequence from  <dig> % gc in the predicted untranslated sequence to  <dig> % gc content in the predicted coding sequence. of the nine least frequently used codons six are exclusively composed of g's and c's. these codons were significantly under-used ranging in prevalence from  <dig> % –  <dig> %. however, the codon ggc, occurs at a frequency of  <dig> %, and the codon gcc, occurs at a frequency of  <dig> %, and due to the increased prevalence, these two codons are considered significant outliers.

discussion
in this report, we characterize  <dig>  nonredundant est sequences generated from eleven cdna libraries derived from pools of juvenile e. scolopes light organs, which were collected at developmentally significant time points with and without colonization by v. fischeri. these nonredundant sequences were: 1) characterized, 2) annotated, and 3) analyzed for novelty within each condition.

unigene sets of over  <dig>  unique transcripts have been reported for vertebrate chordates. however, among the invertebrate chordates and other invertebrates, they are most often less than half that size, ranging from approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  unique transcripts. based on clustering analysis, which estimates the number of transcripts present in the organism, the e. scolopes nonredundant est set containing  <dig>  clusters is in the same range as that of other invertebrates represented in the unigene database. it is interesting to note, that the unigene database reports unique sets as composites of all reported est sequences, i.e., it is not organ specific, thus, the e. scolopes nonredundant set is relatively large for an organ specific library and may indicate a substantially larger transcriptome than has previously been reported for other invertebrates. a comparison of the est clusters derived from the eleven squid light organ libraries showed that the largest number of unique clusters is associated with the 48-h symbiotic condition. this increase in transcriptional diversity is supported by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of standing stock protein in the developing squid light organ, which showed that differences in light organ protein profiles in response to v. fischeri colonization are not easily detectable until  <dig> hours post-inoculation  <cit> .

sequencing of the eleven squid light organ cdna libraries resulted in ests of similar length and quality to sequences generated from previously constructed cdna libraries  <cit> . the predicted 3'-utr length of  <dig> bp is shorter than the  <dig> bp 3'-utr length found for orthologous human and rat genes  <cit> . this may be explained, at least in part, by the occurrence of a-rich sequences within the 3' utrs of a significant fraction of e. scolopes transcripts. this hypothesis is based on the fact that 22% of the squid ests do not contain a recognizable polyadenylation signal sequence within  <dig> bases from the 3' end tail, which suggests that such ests might result from internal oligo-dt priming during first-strand cdna synthesis.

blastx annotation of these  <dig>  sequences identified a number of genes encoding proteins known to be important in the squid light organ for both development and symbiosis, such as: reflectin  <cit> , actin  <cit> , myeloperoxidase  <cit> , aldehyde dehydrogenase  <cit>  and nitric oxide synthase  <cit> . the identification of genes in the est database known to play a significant role in the squid light organ serves as a proof-of-concept, suggesting that the additional sequences provided by the construction of the database will be invaluable for the identification of pathways involved in the early development of the squid light organ and its colonization by v. fischeri. for example, this est library has already played an integral role in the discovery of elements of the nf-kb pathway in the host squid  <cit> .

previous work on the e. scolopes – v. fischeri system has shown that the light organ is undergoing a rapid morphogenesis in response to signals from both the external environment and colonizing v. fischeri in these early hours of the symbiosis  <cit> . the numbers of ests in each library as well as gene ontology  descriptions of annotated ests are reflective of the active state of the organ during these early developmental stages. specifically, categories overrepresented included those involved with signal transduction, cell membrane, development and morphogenesis. expression of genes in these categories is not surprising in light of the fact that the host squid and the bacterial symbiont signal to one another through their cell surfaces, an activity that leads to the dramatic remodeling of host tissues. est sequences often reflect the function of tissue from which the cdna library was derived. to determine if the patterns of genes expressed in these cdna libraries are unique to the squid light organ, we compared our results with that of the nonredundant est database derived from the developing rat heart  <cit> . the squid light organ database is dominated by signal transduction  and membrane-associated proteins , whereas the database of the rat heart is dominated by cell growth and maintenance  and intracellular activities . thus, in a broad sense, the content of these databases appear to mirror the physiological state of these organs.

CONCLUSIONS
this est library is the first effort to generate a bioinformatics tool for the host side of the squid-vibrio association. this tool will allow us use this powerful binary model to ask specific questions to elucidate basic host responses to bacterial colonization in vivo, offering a complement to the more complex associations of vertebrates and the microbiota associated with their mucosa. finally, the creation of a light organ-specific spotted microarray using this est library will pave the way for the study of broad scale changes in host gene expression that underlie the dramatic developmental program of this symbiosis.
