BACKGROUND
dioxin-like compounds  such as polychlorinated biphenyls  and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins  are prevalent contaminants which pose a risk to both public health and the environment. exposure to pcbs and pcdds has been associated with numerous adverse biological effects including reproductive toxicity, dermatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicity  <cit> . the carcinogenic and hepatotoxic effects of dlcs have been shown to be gender dependent, with female rats being more susceptible than male rats  <cit> . the dlcs,  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  and  <dig> ', <dig> ',5-pentachlorobiphenyl ; and the non-dlc  <dig> ', <dig> ', <dig> ',-hexachlorobiphenyl  were investigated by the national toxicology program in a two-year cancer bioassay evaluating their hepatotoxic and carcinogenic properties in female sprague-dawley  rats  <cit> . following  <dig> weeks of chronic p.o. exposure to tcdd  or pcb <dig> , a significant and similar increase in the incidence and range of non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions were observed in the livers of female rats   <cit> . the non-neoplastic lesions included, but were not exclusive to, hepatocyte hypertrophy, pigmentation, bile duct hyperplasia, oval cell hyperplasia, fatty diffuse change, necrosis, inflammation and cholangiofibrosis. the neoplastic lesions included hepatocellular adenoma and cholangiocarcinoma. a significant increase in the incidence of  <dig> of these non-neoplastic lesions and no neoplastic lesions were also observed following  <dig> weeks of exposure to tcdd or pcb <dig>  while only hepatocyte hypertrophy was observed following  <dig> weeks of exposure . thus, the range of hepatotoxic responses to these dlcs is directly dependent on the duration of exposure. in comparison, chronic exposure  to the non-dlc pcb <dig>  only caused a significant increase in the incidence of two non-neoplastic lesions  and did not lead to the formation of neoplasia   <cit> .

most, if not all, of the hepatotoxic effects induced by dlcs are believed to involve the binding and activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor . ligand activation of the ahr induces changes in gene expression and function which are believed to be the major contributing factor to the development of hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity and other toxic responses of dlcs. dlc-induced ahr-independent genomic and cellular responses have also been reported  <cit> , however, these responses likely do not play a major role in the development of hepatotoxicity induced by dlcs. the importance of the ahr in dlc-induced toxicity has been determined in acute studies conducted with female ahr knockout mice. toxic effects that were observed in wild type mice but were absent in ahr knockout mice, included wasting syndrome, thymic atrophy, lipid accumulation in hepatocytes  and liver hypertrophy  <cit> . acute tcdd toxicity is also gender, species and strain specific. following acute exposure to tcdd, female sprague dawley rats exhibit a greater down-regulation in gene expression compared to male rats  <cit> . sprague dawley rats and c57bl/ <dig> mice exhibit different hepatic gene expression profiles following acute tcdd exposure with rat-specific gene responses being associated with lipid metabolism and cell growth while mouse-specific responses are involved in immune function and lipid uptake/metabolism  <cit> . long-evans rats and han/wistar rats exhibit a 1000-fold difference in sensitivity to acute tcdd lethality  <cit>  which is attributed to a point mutation in the ahr protein of han/wistar rats  <cit> . this suggests that the acute toxic effects of tcdd are dependent on ahr functionality, gender, species and strain, and suggest that the chronic toxic effects of dlcs are also mediated through persistent ahr activation.

previous work from our laboratory has surveyed hepatic gene expression in response to ahr ligands and non-ligands following acute and  <dig> weeks of exposure, which were associated with liver hypertrophy in the absence of other hepatotoxic effects  <cit> . although these studies have led to a better understanding of the acute and subchronic genomic responses to dlcs, the evaluation of hepatic gene expression following chronic exposure to dlcs is needed to effectively identify genomic factors that may be contributing to the hepatotoxic effects of these toxins which are observed following  <dig> and  <dig> weeks of exposure . building on previous microarray experiments, comparative analysis was conducted between microarray data from subchronic  and chronic  time-points to identify genomic biomarkers that are sustained throughout chronic exposure. genomic biomarkers that were shared by tcdd and pcb <dig>  but not pcb <dig>  were further analyzed for their acute responsiveness to ascertain a subset of genes which may serve as time-independent genomic biomarkers of exposure to ahr ligands in the female sd rat model. finally, to relate differential hepatic gene expression to the liver pathology observed with chronic exposure to dlcs, phenotypic anchoring was conducted to associate differentially expressed genes with hepatocellular adenoma and cholangiocarcinoma. together these analyses will provide a comprehensive description of the genomic responses which occur in rat hepatic tissue with subchronic and chronic exposure to ahr ligands and will help to isolate those genomic responses which are contributing to the hepatotoxicity observed with chronic exposure to dlcs.

methods
animal exposures and procurement of liver tissue
liver tissues were obtained from the national toxicology program  2-year cancer bioassay investigating the relative carcinogenic potencies of the ahr ligands tcdd and pcb126; and the non-ligand pcb <dig>  <cit> . female sd rats were exposed  <dig> days a wk via oral gavage to toxicologically equivalent doses of tcdd   =  <dig> ), pcb <dig>  , pcb <dig>   or a vehicle control of corn oil:acetone . rats were exposed to these compounds for  <dig> wks  or  <dig> wks . tefs were determined using the  <dig> tef recommendations provided by the world health organization  <cit> . liver tissue was also harvested from female sd rats at  <dig> hr following a single exposure to tcdd . this exposure was conducted to identify early responsive genes which were also shown to be differentially expressed  following exposures to dlcs. this acute dose of tcdd has been previously shown to result in hepatic tissue concentrations of dioxin similar to those observed with subchronic and chronic exposure  <cit> . all procedures were carried out with the approval of the university at buffalo institutional animal care and use committee .

rna isolation and hybridization
the storage and processing of liver samples was described earlier by vezina et al.  <dig>  following storage at -80°c, liver tissues were disrupted by homogenization and total rna was isolated with the qiagen rneasy kit . rna integrity was assessed using the agilent bioanalyzer  <dig> . high quality rna was transformed into biotinylated crna by the roswell park cancer institute gene expression facility  and hybridized to rgu34a genechips  and scanned with the affymetrix  <dig> scanner.

gene microarray data analysis
probe-level data from cell intensity files were background subtracted and normalized by the gc-robust multiarray analysis  method using arrayassist® . absolute fold changes and t-test statistics  corrections) were calculated using arrayassist®. probe-sets were filtered to identify those genes which exhibited a change in expression  of at least 2-fold and a t-test p-value ≤  <dig>  between treated  and control  groups. comparative analysis was conducted using microsoft excel  to further filter the data and identify genes that exhibited statistically significant change  with two or more toxicants. gene annotation and gene symbols were obtained through the affymetrix netaffx™ analysis center software. heat maps were constructed using tigr microarray experiment viewer  <dig>   <cit> . student t-tests and anova analysis with the post-hoc tukey test were conducted between treatment groups using minitab™ . a complete summary of gene microarray data is available through the gene expression omnibus at the national center for biotechnology information at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ as accession numbers gse <dig>  and gse <dig> .

quantitative real-time pcr analysis
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  validated the hepatic expression of ahr genomic biomarkers in livers from rats at  <dig> hr following exposure to tcdd . primers were selected from entrez gene rat gene reference sequences using primer <dig> software  <cit> . the parameters for primer selection were described previously  <cit>  and primer sequences are listed in additional file  <dig>  real-time qpcr was conducted on hepatic cdna using the iq sybr green supermix kit  as described previously in ovando et al. . statistical comparisons of control vs. treated groups was performed with a 2-sample t-test using minitab  <dig> statistical software 

identification of dioxin response elements 
gene regulatory regions spanning  <dig> bp above and  <dig> bp below the transcriptional start site of target genes were obtained from the university of california, santa cruz, genome browser using entrez gene geneid numbers. all obtained sequences were analyzed for core dre sequences  using matinspector . putative dres were those with a core similarity of  <dig>  and matrix similarity equal to or greater than the optimized matrix threshold  <cit> .

phenotypic anchoring of gene expression data
changes in gene expression associated with tcdd, pcb <dig> and pcb <dig> exposure were compared with changes in gene expression associated with rat hepatocellular adenoma   <cit> , human hca  <cit> and human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma   <cit> . eighty-one percent of the human hca tumors were from males  <cit>  while 52%  <cit>  and 41%  <cit>  of the human icc tumors were from males. our approach was limited in that the hca and icc expression data was not reported on a gender specific basis thus preventing us from identifying shared gene responses based on gender. ortholog identification and gene annotation of gene array data obtained from published studies was accomplished using arraytrack  and/or netaffix™   <cit> .

RESULTS
dose-response analysis of hepatic gene expression following chronic exposure to  <dig> ng,  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng/kg/day pcb126
increases in the incidence of non-neoplastic and neoplastic hepatic lesions were observed with increasing dose and duration of exposure to pcb <dig>   <cit> . to evaluate the effect of increasing dose of pcb <dig> on hepatic gene expression, microarray analysis was conducted on hepatic tissue of female sd rats following  <dig> weeks of chronic exposure to  <dig> ng,  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng/kg/day pcb <dig>  gene array analysis showed a positive trend between pcb <dig> dose and the number of genes differentially expressed . in addition, the magnitude of differential expression of several genes also increased with increasing dose of pcb <dig> . sixteen genes were identified which exhibited altered expression at all three doses . four of the sixteen genes were classic ahr responsive genes and exhibited statistically significant increases in expression with increasing dose of pcb <dig>  these genes included cyp1a <dig> , cyp1b <dig> , ugt1a <dig>  and ugt1a <dig>  . the remaining genes in table  <dig> represent a novel set of sensitive genomic biomarkers for chronic exposure to pcb <dig>

identifying genomic biomarkers of subchronic and chronic exposure to tcdd, pcb <dig> and pcb153
during the 2-year cancer bioassays conducted by the ntp, it was observed that continuous exposure to dlcs beyond  <dig> weeks was necessary to lead to the formation of hepatic neoplastic lesions . rats treated with tcdd or pcb <dig> for  <dig> weeks, and then with vehicle control for the remainder of the two-year cancer bioassay showed no difference in the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma or cholangiocarcinoma when compared to control animals  <cit> . this suggests that persistent ahr activation with long-term alterations in gene expression are necessary for the development of hepatic neoplasia.

to identify genomic responses which are sustained throughout chronic exposure, comparative analysis of time-course microarray data was conducted. subchronic  and chronic  exposure to tcdd , led to the differential expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively . through comparative analysis of subchronic and chronic exposure,  <dig> genes were identified that exhibited the same differential expression pattern at both time points . following a similar paradigm for exposure to pcb <dig> ,  <dig> genes were identified that sustained the same differential expression pattern at both time points . the non-hepatotoxic pcb <dig>  caused the sustained differential expression of only  <dig> genes following subchronic and chronic exposure . the sustained genomic responses to tcdd, pcb <dig> and pcb <dig> serve as genomic biomarkers of subchronic and chronic exposure to these compounds.

identification of genomic biomarkers of exposure to ahr ligands
the hepatic gene expression signatures of tcdd and pcb <dig>  while not identical, did exhibit a great deal of overlap. genes that are shared by both expression signatures represent genomic biomarkers of subchronic and chronic exposure to two ahr ligands at toxic equivalent doses. forty-one genomic biomarkers were identified that were shared by the expression signatures of tcdd and pcb <dig>  but not pcb <dig> . these  <dig> genes are genomic biomarkers of exposure to two different ahr ligands and may be applicable to other ahr ligands as biomarkers of exposure . only one gene, psat <dig> , was found to be shared by the expression signatures of all three compounds , where its expression was up-regulated 3- to 8-fold following exposure to tcdd, pcb <dig>  and pcb <dig> 

shown are genes for which expression from microarray analysis significantly differed , by at least 2-fold, compared to the control group. a fold changes in hepatic gene expression from microarray analysis; b fold changes in hepatic gene expression from qpcr at  <dig> h post-exposure to tcdd; c dres identified in genomic dna sequences spanning  <dig> bp above and  <dig> bp below the transcriptional start site. the number in parenthesis indicates the number of dres present; d values from ovando et al. 2006; *genes with p-value <  <dig>  following benjamini-hochberg fdr correction; **statistically different  between control and treated animals  for qpcr; n/p - gene not present in human genome; n/d - gene expression could not be evaluated for that treatment; n/a - not available in the ucsc genome bioinformatics database.

the sustained differential expression of these  <dig> ahr genomic biomarkers at both subchronic and chronic time-points suggests that these genomic responses are time-independent. to validate these biomarkers and determine if the differential expression of these genomic biomarkers are time-independent, real-time qpcr was utilized to evaluate hepatic gene expression in female sd rats at  <dig> h post-exposure to an acute dose of tcdd  . thirty of these  <dig> genes exhibited a 2-fold or greater change in expression  <dig> h post-exposure to tcdd . while acute exposure to tcdd resulted in less than a 2-fold change in the hepatic expression of  <dig> ahr genomic biomarkers,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes exhibited a similar trend in the up or down regulation observed following subchronic and chronic exposure to tcdd and pcb <dig> . the  <dig> genes confirmed through real-time qpcr to be up- or down-regulated  represent time-independent genomic biomarkers of ahr ligands that are responsive at acute, subchronic and chronic time-points and may be applied as a diagnostic and mechanistic tool for the evaluation of ahr-ligand like activity in the female sd rat model.

the  <dig> ahr genomic biomarkers were analyzed for the presence of putative dre sites  within  <dig> bp above and  <dig> bp below the transcriptional start site. the gene regulatory sequences were obtained for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes. sequences for alas <dig>  and mtmr <dig>  were not available through the ucsc genome bioinformatic database and thus prevented analysis for dre sites. of the  <dig> genes assessed,  <dig> of the genes contained one or more putative dre site . this included genes which have been previously shown to be regulated by ahr ligands including the cytochrome p <dig> genes cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig>  <cit>  the udp glycotransferase genes ugt1a <dig> and ugt1a <dig>  <cit> , hal   <cit> , nqo <dig> h dehydrogenase, quinone 1)  <cit> , srd5a <dig>   <cit>  and tsc22d <dig>   <cit> .

phenotypic anchoring of 52-week hepatic gene expression to hepatocellular adenoma and cholangiocarcinoma
following chronic exposure to tcdd and pcb <dig> a significant increase in the incidence of hca and cholangiocarcinoma  is observed in the livers of female sd rats . the appearance of hca and cc was observed with  <dig> weeks of exposure to tcdd and pcb <dig>  but not at earlier time points or with pcb <dig>  to relate genomic responses to the observed liver pathology, comparative analysis was conducted between the  <dig> week hepatic gene expression profiles of tcdd, pcb <dig> and pcb <dig>  and gene array data from published studies on human icc  <cit> , human hca  <cit>  and rat hca  <cit> .

human icc gene expression profiles were obtained from microarray studies conducted on  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  microdissected cholangiocarcinomas. between the two studies,  <dig> genes were identified as exhibiting the same differential expression pattern in human icc and in rat liver following  <dig> weeks of chronic exposure to tcdd and/or pcb <dig>  but not pcb <dig> . among these genes,  <dig> were unique to the obama et al.  icc expression profile,  <dig> were unique to the miller et al.  icc expression profile and  <dig> genes were shared between the two icc expression profiles. the two genes that were present in both icc expression profiles were gata <dig>  and timp <dig> .

n/c indicates no change in gene expression for that treatment.

human and sprague-dawley rat hca gene expression profiles obtained from microdissected hca tissues  <cit>  were used for comparative analysis. additional rat hca gene expression profiles were kindly provided by dr. sun hee yim . seventeen genes were identified which exhibited the same differential expression pattern in human hca as that seen in the livers of rats exposed for  <dig> weeks to tcdd and/or pcb <dig> . additionally, seven genes were identified which exhibited the same differential expression pattern in both rat hca gene expression studies and in livers from rats exposed for  <dig> weeks to tcdd and/or pcb <dig>  but not pcb <dig> . interestingly, the genes gata <dig>  agt ) and bhlhb <dig>  were down-regulated in icc and hca as well as the  <dig> week expression profiles of tcdd and/or pcb <dig>  but not pcb <dig> 

n/c indicates no change in gene expression for that treatment.

discussion
toxicological studies conducted by the national toxicology program have shown a significant increase in the incidence of hepatic neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions in female sd rats following chronic exposure to tcdd and pcb <dig>  <cit> . studies with ahr knockout mice have shown that the acute toxicity of tcdd is dependent on the functionality of the ahr  <cit> . this suggests that the hepatotoxic effects of tcdd and related dioxin-like compounds  are mediated through the ahr, and changes in gene expression resulting from activation of this transcription factor are likely the principle mode of toxicity of these compounds. in an effort to identify the genomic responses that may be contributing to the observed liver toxicity, toxicogenomics was conducted to provide a comprehensive description of hepatic gene expression with acute exposure to tcdd and subchronic and chronic exposure to tcdd and pcb <dig>  the most potent dioxin-like pcb.

through the comparative analysis of time-course microarray data, hepatic gene expression signatures of subchronic and chronic exposure to tcdd, pcb <dig> and pcb <dig> were identified . the hepatic gene expression signature of pcb <dig>  consists of  <dig> genes which show sustained differential expression at both subchronic  and chronic  time points . in addition, a dose response analysis of hepatic gene expression was conducted following  <dig> weeks of chronic exposure to  <dig> ng,  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng/kg/day pcb <dig>  gene array analysis showed a positive correlation between pcb <dig> dose and the number of genes differentially expressed . a similar dose response relationship has been reported for female mice subjected to an acute exposure to pcb <dig>  <cit> . comparative analysis of the hepatic expression profiles of chronic  exposure to  <dig> ng,  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng/kg/day pcb <dig> identified  <dig> genes which were differentially expressed at all three concentrations . interestingly, of those  <dig> genes, ccl <dig>  ligand 2), chka , thrb  and synj <dig>  are not present in the 13- and  <dig> week hepatic gene expression signature of pcb <dig> . this indicates that even though differential expression of ccl <dig>  chka, thrb and synj <dig> are sensitive endpoints of chronic pcb <dig> exposure, as evident in their responsiveness at  <dig> ng/kg/day pcb <dig>  these changes do not manifest themselves following  <dig> weeks of subchronic exposure to  <dig> ng/kg/day pcb <dig>  these four genes help illustrate the caution that one must use in categorizing a gene as a biomarker of exposure. as seen in these results, ccl <dig>  chka, thrb and synj <dig> are examples of sensitive genomic responses to chronic pcb <dig> exposure, however, they do not exhibit the early subchronic responsiveness that would make them beneficial as biomarkers in early stage identification of pcb <dig> exposure.

pathological data shows that continuous exposure to tcdd and pcb <dig> beyond a period of  <dig> weeks is necessary to cause the formation of hepatic neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions  <cit> . considering the relevance of genomic responses to the toxicity of dlcs, these data suggest that changes in gene expression that are sustained throughout chronic treatment are playing a pivotal role in the development of hepatic lesions. seventy-five and  <dig> genes were identified which showed sustained differential expression following subchronic  and chronic  exposure to tcdd and pcb <dig>  respectively . the sustained differential expression of these genes over a  <dig> week span suggests that these genes are likely playing an important role in the hepatotoxic effects of tcdd and pcb <dig>  nine genes showed sustained differential expression following subchronic and chronic exposure to pcb <dig> . only one gene, psat <dig>  was differentially expressed  in the expression signatures of pcb <dig>  tcdd and pcb <dig> . psat <dig> is a phosphoserine aminotransferase involved in serine biosynthesis whose expression has been shown to be up-regulated in colon adenocarcinoma  <cit> , colorectal cancer  <cit>  and breast cancer  <cit> . additionally, increased expression of psat <dig> in colorectal cancer and breast cancer is associated with a poor regression of tumor metastases following therapy  <cit> . the increase expression of psat <dig> following tcdd, pcb <dig> and pcb <dig> treatments suggests that its response is not specific to dlcs. the identification of unique gene expression profiles in sprague-dawley rats exposed to dlcs  versus non-dlcs  corroborates similar observations previously reported in ovariectomized c57bl/ <dig> mice  <cit> .

from the hepatic gene expression signatures of pcb <dig> and tcdd,  <dig> genomic biomarkers were identified that are shared by both compounds, following  <dig> and  <dig> weeks of exposure . the observation that these  <dig> genomic biomarkers are shared by two ahr ligands suggests that differential expression of these genes requires ahr activation. of the  <dig> ahr-ligand genomic biomarkers,  <dig> exhibited a 2-fold or greater change in expression  <dig> h post-exposure to an acute dose of tcdd, as determined by real-time qpcr. in addition, approximately 40%of these genes have shown a 2-fold change in expression following acute exposure to tcdd in other studies conducted on female and/or male sprague-dawley rats  <cit> , adding further support that these genomic biomarkers represent time-independent primary responses in gene expression to ahr ligands. ten of the ahr genomic biomarkers resulted in a less than 2-fold change following acute exposure to tcdd, however,  <dig> of these biomarkers exhibited a similar trend in the up or down regulation observed following subchronic and chronic exposure to tcdd and pcb <dig> . furthermore, other microarray studies have shown that following an acute exposure to tcdd, the majority of these genomic biomarkers exhibit a similar response as that seen in our study  <cit> , thus providing further evidence for their roles as biomarkers.

seven of the  <dig> genomic biomarkers are members of the "ahr gene battery" which are a group of genes known to be regulated by the ahr  <cit> . genomic biomarker genes which fall into this category include cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig> , cyp1b <dig>  nqo <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  ugt1a <dig> and aldh3a <dig> . more novel genes included among the  <dig> genomic biomarkers include genes involved in trafficking/transport , cell adhesion , cell signaling  and development/differentiation . enpp <dig> , a tumor cell motility stimulating factor  <cit> , was up-regulated following tcdd and pcb <dig> exposure. this agrees with previous observations implicating enpp <dig> as being one of the most commonly up-regulated genes in cancer cells and being widely involved in tumor progression, invasion and metastasis  <cit> . ptprd , a protein tyrosine phosphatase, has been identified as a tumor suppressor  <cit>  whose expression is down-regulation in breast, colon and glioblastoma tumors  <cit> . the down-regulation of ptprd following tcdd and pcb <dig> exposure likely contributes to the neoplastic effects of the compounds. trib <dig> ) is a regulatory protein which has been shown to be up-regulated following stressful conditions  <cit> , consistent with its up-regulation following tcdd and pcb <dig> exposure.

twenty-five of the  <dig> ahr-ligand genomic biomarkers contained one or more putative dre within  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream from the transcriptional start site . however, genes such as cyp3a <dig> , ces <dig>  and serpina <dig>  peptidase inhibitor, clade a , member 7) did not contain a putative dre in the region examined , suggesting that an activated ahr may not directly bind to these genes. interestingly, even though cyp3a <dig>  ces <dig> and serpina <dig> do not contain any dres in their promoter region, their acute sensitivity to tcdd has been previously shown to be dependent on a functional ahr  <cit> . this indicates that the presence or lack of a dre in the promoter region does not solely determine the response of a gene following tcdd exposure; it is also possible that a dre located outside the region examined here is able to influence gene expression.

in order to relate changes in gene expression to the observed hepatotoxicity, the  <dig> week hepatic gene expression profiles from tcdd and pcb <dig> treated rats were compared to the expression profiles from previously published studies  <cit>  that examined hepatic neoplastic lesions similar to those observed in the ntp studies. through this approach, an attempt was made to identify common genes which may play a role in the development and progression of the neoplastic effects observed with dlcs. this comparison identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes which were differentially expressed with exposure to dlcs and human icc, human hca and rat hca, respectively . interestingly, of the genes common to both dlc exposure and the examined disease states, alas <dig>  cadps , cyp3a <dig>  enpp <dig>  pik3c2g  and trib <dig> were also present among the  <dig> time independent ahr genomic biomarkers. for both of the hca and icc studies there were genes which did not overlap between the similar disease states which is likely due to inter-individual differences in the tumor micro-environment, environmental conditions and other genetic components.

the genes gata <dig> and timp <dig> were down-regulated in both of the human icc expression profiles and following tcdd exposure. gata <dig> was also down-regulated following pcb <dig> exposure and in the human hca expression profile. additionally, the genes bhlhb <dig>  agt and gata <dig> were down-regulated in the icc and hca disease states and following exposure to dlcs. gata <dig> is a zinc finger transcription factors which can regulate gene expression and cell cycle progression  <cit> . expression of gata <dig> is significantly depressed in most human adrenocortical tumors  <cit>  and it has been hypothesized that decreased expression of gata <dig> may be an important event for the escape of tumor cells from normal control mechanisms  <cit> . timp <dig> is a matrix metalloproteinase with proapoptotic activity  <cit>  whose expression is significantly lower in human cholangiocarcinomas  <cit> . it has been suggested that timp <dig> may serve as a tumor suppressor gene in cholangiocarcinoma  <cit> . bhlhb <dig>  is a hypoxia-induced gene whose expression is elevated in several malignant tumors  <cit> . the down-regulation of bhlhb <dig> in hca, icc and following tcdd exposure suggest that these tumor micro-environments are not hypoxic. agt, is a known precursor of angiotensin i and has shown antitumor effects in vitro  <cit> and in vivo  <cit>  by inducing apoptosis and decreasing endothelial cell proliferation  <cit> . the down-regulation of agt in hca, icc and following tcdd exposure likely contributes to the formation of neoplastic lesions.

it should be noted that of the  <dig> genes shared by the 52-week gene expression data  and gene expression data from the published reports of icc and hca, only  <dig> genes  were found to be differentially expressed by the non-dlc pcb <dig>  gene expression of got <dig> , a mitochondrial enzyme involved in energy transduction  <cit> , was down-regulated in the pcb <dig> and human hca expression profiles while ugcg , an enzyme involved in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis  <cit> , gene expression was up-regulated in these two expression profiles. stmn <dig> , a cellular protein involved in mictotubule destabilization  <cit> , is over expressed in a wide variety of human cancers including liver, breast, lung and prostate cancer  <cit> . stmn <dig> was up-regulated in the tcdd, pcb <dig> and human hca expression profiles suggesting that while it is a good marker for different types of human cancer, it may not be a valid biomarker for dlc exposure in sprague dawley rats. gene expression of alas <dig>  an enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis  <cit> , was down-regulated in the tcdd, pcb <dig> and human hca profiles but up-regulated in the pcb <dig> expression profile, suggesting that down-regulation of alas <dig> may promote tumor development.

CONCLUSIONS
toxicogenomic analysis has identified hepatic genomic biomarkers of exposure to the ahr ligands, tcdd and pcb126; and the non-dioxin-like compound, pcb <dig>  from these genomic biomarkers, time-independent hepatic gene expression signatures were constructed that are unique to tcdd, pcb <dig> and pcb <dig>  in addition to identifying gene expression signatures for the dioxin-like compounds tcdd and pcb <dig>   <dig> common genomic biomarkers were identified which are shared by these ahr ligands. these  <dig> common genomic biomarkers may serve as biomarkers of exposure to other ahr ligands and can be used in the risk assessment of other environmental toxins believed to exert their effect through ahr activation. together, the data collected in this study can serve to guide future investigations in assessing risk of dioxin-like compounds and elucidating the mechanisms of action by which dioxin-like compounds induce their hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects.
