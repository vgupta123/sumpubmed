BACKGROUND
transposable elements  influence the evolution, structure, amplification, gene creation, mutation and transcriptional regulation of genes and genomes  <cit> . they are also useful as genetic markers in basic and applied science  <cit> . tes occupy a substantial fraction of sequenced plant genomes  <cit> , ranging from over 14% in arabidopsis  <cit>  to more than 80% in maize  <cit> . because of their nature and characteristic patterns of insertion  <cit> , tes may influence large portions of the genome. a study found that one-sixth of all rice genes had some kind of association with tes  <cit> . some te insertions occur within or near genes, thereby disrupting normal gene expression  <cit> . such insertions may influence phenotypic characteristics, as in petal color of gentians  <cit> , or disruption of vitamin e synthesis in sunflower  <cit> . however, due to gene redundancy or to insertion in regions of the genome that do not affect gene expression, the majority of te insertions do not have detectable effects on morphology or physiology. for example, neither the insertion of a stowaway element in an intron of the manganese superoxide dismutase gene  <cit> , nor the insertion of retrotransposon vine- <dig> in one member of the alcohol dehydrogenase multigene family  <cit>  affected plant growth and development. nevertheless, tes can influence the evolution of plant gene families, as exemplified by disease resistance genes in several plants  <cit> . insertions can also result in the capture of gene fragments by tes, or the adoption of parts of tes by genes. some of the clearest examples of gene capture by tes involve pack-mules. in rice, over  <dig> of these gene-carrying transposon-derived elements were found in  <dig> mb of sequence  <cit> , and the acquisition of multiple gene fragments from multiple loci may result in the creation of new genes  <cit> . genes such as far <dig> and fhy <dig> , have a conserved transposase-derived region, whose dna binding and regulatory capacities have been adopted for transcriptional control of downstream genes  <cit> . as was first shown by mcclintock in the early experiments that uncovered the ac/ds te system in maize  <cit> , some types of stress can activate tes, which can in turn modify gene expression. te expression triggered by stress has been reported for several elements including: tnt <dig>  <cit>  and tto <dig>  <cit>  in tobacco; tos <dig> in rice  <cit> ; and bare- <dig> in barley  <cit> . however, relatively few active tes have been identified and several expression studies indicate that transcription and transposition are rare for most elements  <cit> . while some studies have focused on the expression of individual elements, more recent approaches have compared genome-wide expression data of tes. these kind of studies have been used to identify te cassettes in expressed genes in coffee species  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , and the activity of different te families in maize  <cit>  and sugarcane  <cit> . flax  is one of over  <dig> species within the family linaceae, and is a member of the order malpighiales along with three other species with published whole genome sequences: poplar , cassava , and castor   <cit> . flax is a predominantly self-polinating annual crop grown in temperate regions  <cit> . distinct varieties of flax are cultivated for either seed  or bast fibers. we recently reported a whole genome shotgun  assembly of a linseed variety, cdc bethune  <cit> . the assembly contains 302mb of the estimated 373mb nuclear genome, in scaffolds with n50=694kb. flax is considered a diploid , although our genome analysis pointed to a recent whole genome duplication 5-9mya. flax appears to have originated from its wild relative, l. bienne, with cultivation and domestication probably starting in the mesopotamian valleys between 8000– <dig> years ago  <cit> . flax has been studied for decades as a model of genome plasticity  <cit> . in the variety stormont cirrus, individuals exposed to certain stresses can produce first generation progeny that show stable changes in several traits including an up to 15% difference in nuclear dna content. highly repetitive, tandemly arrayed elements  are among the major contributors to this dna content variation. a novel, non-te, low-copy insertion sequence  is also associated with these changes  <cit> . it should be noted that most elite flax varieties, including cdc bethune, which is the subject of the wgs assembly, do not exhibit this rapid change in genome size. nevertheless, the study of flax and its repetitive sequences remains of special relevance to understanding genome evolution in general. we previously reported the preliminary identification of tes as part of the description of the flax wgs assembly  <cit> . the assembly contained  <dig> % tes as defined by sequence coverage. while the calculated proportion of the genome covered by tes in flax is slightly lower than other plant species with small genomes, much variation exists in te content in plants  <cit> . only a small proportion of the tes described in the flax genome could be identified through alignment to previously characterized elements from other species  <cit> . instead, most of the tes were identified only by de novo prediction methods. here we extend this previous report to present a detailed characterization of the main superfamilies of tes in flax and to explore their potential influence on genome evolution and gene expression.

RESULTS
tes in the flax genome
in a previous study, we described a de novo whole genome shotgun  assembly of flax based on next-generation  sequencing  <cit> , including a brief description of the transposable element  component of that assembly. using various bioinformatics tools to identify repeats de novo, we found a total of  <dig>  putative interspersed repeats divided into  <dig> consensus interspersed repeats for piler,  <dig>  repeats for repeatscout,  <dig>  ltr elements from ltr_finder and  <dig> ltr elements using ltr_struc . each of these tools offered certain advantages. for example, piler was faster and had longer average output sequence length  than repeatscout , but at the same time piler was more stringent and identified fewer sequences. furthermore, ltr_finder found more sequences than ltr_struc but a few sequences were only found using ltr_struc. although the parameters used with the algorithms for de novo repeat finding were set to find interspersed repeats and to filter out low complexity regions, some of the repeats identified may have nevertheless constituted non-te gene families, pseudogenes or highly repeated gene domains. we therefore curated the repeats to identify those that most likely represented tes. after curation, the filtered library had a total of  <dig> putative tes:  <dig> from piler,  <dig> from repeatscout,  <dig> from ltr_finder and  <dig> from ltr_struc . we combined these annotated de novo repeats with the tes from the viridiplantae division of repbase, to make a database for repeatmasker, which, when applied to the flax genome assembly, masked a total of  <dig>  mb  as sequence with high similarity to tes . ltr retrotransposons of the superfamilies copia and gypsy were the dominant group with over 69% of the hits and over 74% of the sequence coverage. these superfamilies were followed by the non-ltr retrotransposons of the l <dig> group and the dna transposons from the mutator superfamily. when these results were compared with the analysis of  <dig>  mb of sanger dideoxy sequence reported for bac-ends from the same flax variety  <cit> , we found that both data sets showed ltr elements to be the most prevalent group of tes, with the copia group as the most abundant type followed by gypsy elements and lines. however, hat elements were more abundant than mutator elements in the bac-end sequences, in contrast to our observations from the wgs assembly. other smaller groups also differed in their rank order in the bac and wgs analyses, and the total proportional coverage for the wgs was always higher than for the bac-end sequencing. this was probably due to differences in methodology; whereas in the present study we used both similarity-based and de novo identification, the bac-end analysis relied mainly on similarity-based approaches for repeat identification. 

putative expression and abundance of main families of tes
we compared the te sequences to est databases to estimate the relative expression of each type of te. the majority of ests queried were obtained from the same variety as was used for the wgs assembly  <cit> . to reduce redundancy, all of the putative te sequences generated by the various de novo algorithms were first aligned to each other to generate clusters. clustering was performed so that each member of a cluster had ≥80% similarity to every other member of the cluster. each cluster was referred to as a family in accordance with the standards established by wicker et al.,  <cit> . a representative te  from each family was aligned to all available flax ests from genbank. table  <dig> shows the number and proportion of families in each major superfamily of tes that aligned to ests. the ltr elements had the largest number of families that aligned to one or more ests. this was consistent with their observed abundance and coverage in the genome. ltr elements also had some of the highest proportions of expressed te families. on the other hand, the hat superfamily had fewer families than the ltr elements, but had a higher proportion of families with associated ests. to establish the copy number of each of the te families, a representative sequence from each family  was aligned to the wgs assembly using blat. a threshold of 80% was used, following wicker et al.,  <cit> . within superfamilies of tes there were many families with only a few copies in the genome, and a small number of families with a high copy number . when the copy numbers within each family were compared to the relative number of ests aligned to that family, no correlation was observed . this indicated that elements with a high copy number are not necessarily currently active. this was observed in all families, with the exception of the hat superfamily, which showed a weak positive correlation  between copy number and est counts. 

relationship of tes to genes
we investigated the distribution of tes with respect to genes in the wgs scaffolds. we limited our analysis to  <dig> , <dig> bp of genome assembly that was contained in  <dig> scaffolds of 1mb or longer, since this allowed analyses of relationships of several contiguous genes and/or tes. when individual scaffolds were analyzed as units, there was a highly correlated inverse relationship between the coverage of tes and genes  meaning that overall te distribution in the flax genome was not completely random. the same trend was found when we analyzed each of the four most abundant superfamilies separately . the distribution patterns in the  <dig> studied scaffolds showed that some had dense coverage of tes , while others had many genes but few tes, and still other scaffolds had similar proportional coverage of tes and genes . we chose  <dig> representative scaffolds to illustrate the trends of distribution. four of these were gene-rich, four had a similar proportion of genes and tes, and four had a higher proportion of tes than genes . we divided the  <dig> scaffolds into equally sized  <dig> kb bins and then calculated the proportional coverage of genes, tes and the four largest superfamilies of transposable elements . within the scaffolds that were rich in tes, we observed a few bins in which the frequency of genes was also high . the te rich scaffolds were dominated by copia and gypsy superfamilies, with the later having a higher proportion. the l <dig> and mutator elements had a lower proportional coverage than the ltr elements. the graphs did not show any apparent clustering pattern of any te superfamily within each scaffold. a second group of scaffolds with similar proportional coverage of both tes and genes showed several subregions in which tes and genes overlapped or alternate in coverage . finally the gene-rich scaffolds seemed to be largely devoid of tes  and just a very few bins had proportional coverage of tes close to 25%, while most bins were saturated for genes. we next used monte carlo  statistics to test whether there was any scaffold  in which tes overlapped genes more frequently than expected by chance. overlaps did not occur more frequently than expected by chance, whether the scaffolds were analyzed as individual units, or divided into  <dig> kb bins. moreover, when the major superfamilies of tes  were tested individually, none of the groups overlapped genes more than expected by chance in any scaffold . together this shows that that although regions of overlap did occur, and some tes can be inserted into or close to genes, there were no individual scaffolds or bins with an unexpectedly high proportion of tes in close association with genes. however, in scaffolds with a larger coverage of tes, the probability of overlap with genes was higher as judged by a significant positive correlation between the proportion of bases overlapped by tes in genes and the te proportional coverage , and a significant negative correlation with the gene proportional coverage  . in fact, when we used the  <dig>  total predicted genes on these scaffolds to look for est matches, it was found that the proportion of genes with matching ests in each scaffold was negatively correlated  with the proportional coverage of tes . we next performed chi-square tests to determine whether any of the te superfamilies, as compared to all other tes, had a higher propensity to insert within or close to genes. figure 5a shows that while the proportions were not significantly different  for the copia, mutator and harbinger elements, there were marginally significant differences for the l <dig> and cacta tes, and strong significant differences for the remaining superfamilies. from this later group the hats, helitrons and the unclassified ltrs were found inside of genes more often than expected by chance, while gypsy tes were less commonly found inside genes than expected. when the analysis was repeated for the regions flanking the genes, three groups of dna transposons  showed significantly higher affinity for the  <dig> kb of sequence that flanked genes when compared to their overall distributions . the same was true for the retrotransposons l <dig> and copia, while gypsy elements were significantly underrepresented in this region. finally the analysis was repeated one last time for the flanking  <dig> kb of genes  and in this opportunity only cacta, l <dig> and gypsy showed significant differences with this later one still below the expected numbers on these gene flanking regions.

insertions of full ltr elements and evolution
a total of  <dig>  putative ltr sequences found by ltr_finder and ltr_struc were filtered for redundancy, resulting in  <dig>  unique sequences. after curation, some of these sequences were excluded from genome masking, because they contained internal non-te genes, or other sequences of non-transposon origin, which would have resulted in masking of non-te genome sections. however, the complete set of  <dig>  unique sequences was used in subsequent analyses in order to more fully describe patterns of evolutionary importance like foreign dna capture by tes. among the  <dig> unique ltr sequences,  <dig> sequences corresponded to copia elements,  <dig> were gypsy,  <dig> were undetermined ltr elements, and the rest were ltrs that flanked other types of tes. the copia retrotransposons had an average size of  <dig>  kb while the gypsy tes were  <dig>  kb on average. the ltr elements that had either regions of undetermined internal size, or regions bearing other types of tes, were  <dig>  kb on average . when the ltr similarity was compared, the elements within these three groups had a similarity average of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively; and the average distance between the tes and the closest predicted gene was  <dig>  kb ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  kb  . the divergence of intra-element ltr sequences was used to calculate the age of insertion of the unique elements, and a graph of their distribution in time was built . as seen in the figure, copia elements had increasing activity in the last  <dig> million years, with many members active in the very recent past. there were  <dig> copia sequences with 100% intra-element ltr similarity, and the average time of insertion of the elements in this superfamily was  <dig>  mya. in the meantime, the less abundant gypsy elements increased activity around 7– <dig> mya ago, but their activity started decreasing  <dig> to  <dig> mya. there was only  <dig> gypsy element with 100% ltr similarity and the average date of insertion for these elements was  <dig>  mya. additionally there were four elements that were inserted more than  <dig> mya . finally, the undetermined ltr elements  increased activity at around the same time as gypsy elements, and were even more active than copia elements until around  <dig>  mya, after which time they were still active but in a lesser proportion than copia. there were  <dig> undetermined elements with 100% ltr similarity and their average date of insertion was  <dig>  mya. when the  <dig> retrotransposon sequences bearing 100% ltr pair intra-element similarity were mapped back to all scaffolds in the genome, we found a total of  <dig> insertion sites with 100% similarity to the original sequences. only eight copia tes had more than one exact match  in different genome regions . when the match threshold was relaxed to 80% to find the number of copies that may have been related to the recently inserted copy,  <dig> elements had more than one related copy ; from these,  <dig> were again copia elements and one  was an undetermined ltr element. when these recent insertion elements were compared to available ests,  <dig> copia retrotransposons had a related est , and  <dig> undetermined elements had an est match. three of the undetermined elements had numerous est matches ; but since the internal regions of these elements were either undetermined or matching sections of basal genes, the putative expression could correspond to genes located elsewhere in the genome. finally, the distance between these recent te insertions and genes showed that most of the recently inserted copies of ltr elements were located close to genes . from among these ltr elements, all of those located within the first  <dig> kb flanking the genes were copia when analyzing the  <dig> scaffolds of over  <dig> mb, and  <dig> out of  <dig> were also copia when analyzing all available scaffolds. to investigate the internal composition of the ltr sequences, all  <dig> unique ltr sequences were used as queries in repeatexplorer  <cit> , which extracted protein domains of query sequences based on comparisons to a large database of transposons. domains were identified only in the elements we had classified as copia or gypsy. all copia and gypsy elements matched domains only from their respective superfamilies with the exception of two tes that we had classified as copia elements but were found by repeatexplorer to contain domains of gypsy tes. whether these two instances represented nested insertions, recombination events, and chimeras or misassembled fragments is yet to be investigated. overall, these results showed that our annotation of tes was accurate . furthermore, copia elements had more internal recognizable domains than gypsy elements . from a total of  <dig> complete ltr-copia elements, almost 55% contained four or five recognizable domains, while only 13% of the ltr-gypsy elements  had four recognizable domains, and only one sequence in which all five domains were recognized. when each domain was assessed separately, the proportion of copia elements with a recognizable domain was always higher than in gypsy . these observations provide further evidence for a higher level of conservation and potential activity of copia as compared to gypsy. 

discussion
tes in the flax genome
the flax genome is estimated to be 373mb in length, and we have reported here and previously that at least 23% of its sequence is made of tes  <cit> . we expect that the actual te coverage of the complete genome is higher than the 23% we reported, for the following reasons:  unclassified repeated sequences found by our de novo approach could constitute new or highly divergent types of tes, but these were not used for masking;  numerous ltr elements with unknown or non-te internal domains were not included in the masking, and we did not use specific algorithms to identify possible tes that lacked internal recognized domains;  the wgs assembly may be missing some regions that are rich in repeated sequences  <cit> . if the complete genome sequence could be analyzed, including regions missing from the wgs assembly, we expect not only that the proportion of tes would increase, but also the relative abundance of the main superfamilies could change since gypsy elements are rich in heterochromatic regions  <cit> , which are usually more difficult to assemble. nevertheless, our estimate of genome coverage by tes is comparable to what has been found for other sequenced plant genomes with sizes slightly larger than flax   <cit> ; indeed it has been proposed that in angiosperms, approximately one third of the genome is made up of tes  <cit> , which is in general agreement with our estimate for flax. although te content may be more related to genome size variation in plants with larger genomes  <cit>  there is a trend showing that genome size correlates positively with the abundance and expansion of tes  <cit> . while there are exceptions to this rule, flax with its smaller genome has a much lower percentage of tes when compared to larger genomes like maize with over 85% tes  <cit> . we found that ltr elements  dominated the population of tes in the flax genome . ltr retrotransposon abundance has been described in numerous plant species including some of the closely related species to flax that have been fully sequenced. in castor bean  the length covered by ltr elements accounts for about one third of all repeats while dna tes constitute less than 2%  <cit> ; while in poplar  ltr elements constitute around 17% of the bases of all repeats , and dna te content is close to 5%  <cit> . although the proportion of sequence covered by ltr elements in flax is larger than in castor or poplar, the predominance of ltr elements is typical in many plant genomes , fragaria vesca  <cit> , malus domestica  <cit> , glycine max  <cit> , phaseolus vulgaris , populus trichocarpa  <cit>  -  and ricinus communis  <cit> . only linum usitatissimum , vitis vinifera  <cit> , theobroma cacao  <cit>  and cucumis sativus  <cit>  seem to have higher coverage by the copia superfamily, although in these last two genomes only the number of elements and not the coverage in bp was shown in the referenced papers and therefore they could not be included in additional file  <dig>  the prevalence of a superfamily may be related to amplification events of specific groups of tes and to the activity of such elements, which may depend on just a few active copies of the family  <cit> . an interesting example is the genus gossypium <cit> , in which one of the species with the smallest genomes had a high density of copia elements. gossypium species with larger genomes had an increased copy number of gypsy elements, most of which represented just one subgroup of the gypsy sequences. such amplification can be lineage-specific and therefore result in changes in genome size  <cit> . in flax we found that copia elements were abundant, diverse and some members were recently active , which would explain a higher current influence of such elements. lines and mutator elements were the most abundant after the ltr retrotransposons . although these two types of elements seem to be or have been fairly active, their lesser abundance when compared to ltr elements can be explained at least in part by their transposition mechanisms. for example, the mechanism of non-ltr retrotransposition generally creates truncated copies of the elements, which would largely decrease their coverage in a genome  <cit> ; additionally plant lines are very diverse and heterogeneous due to the error-prone mechanism of their reverse transcriptase, and the accumulation of mutations during long evolutionary periods  <cit> , which limits their identification. in the case of the mutator elements, their cut and paste transposition does not increase copy number as much as retrotransposition. additionally, non-autonomous gene-carrying mutators or mules  can sometimes be difficult to identify by traditional bioinformatics approaches, and seem to be widely divergent  <cit> . thus, in flax, identification of such elements may also be influenced by the high mutation rates and transposition mechanisms, resulting in lower percentages of identified mutator and line elements.

putative expression and abundance of main families of tes
besides being abundant, ltr elements were also diverse in the flax wgs assembly. the number of families  was probably overestimated, since as a result of the masking process, some of the fragments we found may in fact be different segments of a single element. nevertheless, there was a general correlation between superfamily genome coverage and the number of families found. alignment of tes to est databases showed that just a small proportion of flax tes might be active, most of which were copia ltr elements . our results are in agreement with the survey done in over  <dig>  ests for sugarcane where copia elements had more matching ests than gypsy retrotransposons  <cit> , although in sugarcane , dna transposons also seemed to be fairly active. in plants, te activity depends on regulatory factors including stress-driven transcriptional regulation and epigenetic silencing, which allow activation of just a few elements under specific environmental and developmental circumstances  <cit> . for example in maize, where more than 80% of the genome is made of tes, a survey of over  <dig> million ests showed that only  <dig> % of them matched tes, and most of the families with putative activity were ltr retroelements. thus for flax, as well as for most plant species studied, the activity of tes seems relatively low, and may increase to detectable levels only in response to stress. additionally, it has been shown that in certain families of tes the percentage of polyadenylated expressed sequences is low  <cit> . because most est libraries are built by poly-a extension, this may artificially limit the proportion of expressed tes that can be detected by alignment to ests. we also found that across all tes there were fewer families with high copy numbers throughout the genome and most families within each superfamily had less than  <dig> copies , which is in agreement with findings in soybean where 78% of ltr families are present at copy numbers below  <dig>  <cit> . while low copy number could be related to low transposition rates, mechanisms like high mutation rate  <cit> , recombination  <cit>  and nested insertions  <cit> , create rapid variability in tes that results in divergence among tes, and therefore, a low number of similar sequences. since we did not find a correlation between copy numbers and putative expression , it is more likely that mechanisms of divergence and not the transposition of low copy number families account for the trend we found. this lack of correlation is in agreement with previous findings in maize  <cit>  and contradicts a previous view that low copy number elements are the ones that are predominantly expressed  <cit> .

relationship of tes to genes
the location of tes in the flax genome was not completely random. it was evident that some scaffolds came from genomic regions rich in tes  and were highly depleted in genes. conversely, other scaffolds were rich in genes but depleted in tes, and still others had similar coverage of tes and genes. a global negative correlation of te coverage and gene coverage agrees with a model in where there is purifying selection against tes in coding regions to avoid detrimental effects on genome function; this model was clearly presented for arabidopsis  <cit> . in sequenced genomes such as those of sorghum bicolor  <cit>  or brachypodium distachyon  <cit> , where the distribution of tes has been mapped to chromosomes, the bulk of retrotransposons seem to be clustered around the centromeres, while less are close to gene-rich regions probably due to rapid elimination by controlling and selective host mechanisms  <cit> . when each of the  <dig> largest scaffolds was analyzed as an individual unit, there was no evidence for an overall pattern in which tes occurred inside genes more that expected by chance . however, there were certain superfamilies that were more likely to do so when compared to the rest of tes . several dna te superfamilies and l <dig> elements fell inside and close to genes more often than expected, while gypsy elements were always underrepresented in and around genes, and copia retrotransposons were only significant in the first  <dig> kb flanking genes. in arabidopsis an analysis to find chimeric genes/tes showed significant differences for copia, en-spm, gypsy and helitrons  <cit> . while both for flax and arabidopsis there was an overrepresentation of en-spm and underrepresentation of gypsy tes, copia elements were overrepresented inside genes in arabidopsis but not in flax, and helitrons were underrepresented in arabidopsis while this superfamily and hats were significantly overrepresented in flax. the overrepresentation of class ii tes in flax genes is consistent with reviews describing the close association of genes and these elements including the domestication of transposon proteins into genes  <cit> . for example, tes like en-spm/cacta are closely associated with genes in the triticaceae and they may even capture gene fragments as they move and recombine in the genome  <cit> . in the case of helitrons, extensive gene capture and shuffling mediated by these elements has been reported  <cit> . for hats, gene shuffling has been reported in maize  <cit> , and experiments with rice have shown that the ndart <dig> and its relatives belonging to hats tend to fall within of very close to genes  <cit> . in the meantime, while mutator elements were not overrepresented inside genes, they were abundant in the  <dig> kb of dna flanking them. the close relationship of mutator elements with genes allow te-mediated gene movement, as has been shown for mutator-like elements  in rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , and relates to fixation of te enzymes like transposase, which is part of fhy <dig> and far <dig> genes involved in phytochrome a signalling  <cit> . putative homologs of these two transposase bearing genes were also found in flax . the gypsy underrepresentation in gene coding regions of flax could be related to their tendency to cluster close to centromeric regions. this has been shown in grass species  <cit> , in plants like sunflower  <cit>  and has more recently been proposed for plants like poplar  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . it has been speculated that the reason for this insertion bias may be related to a specific domain in the integrase protein  <cit> ; and such differences in integrase proteins may also be related to the differing distributions between gypsy and copia elements. finally, copia elements were overrepresented in the  <dig> kb of sequence that flanked genes . in arabidopsis, the random pattern of copia insertion allows them to insert close to coding regions  <cit> , although in time, the elements are subjected to negative selection. a similar pattern could be true for flax since we found that many recently inserted copia tes were close to genes . this insertion pattern might have important implications since tes close to genes can become positive regulators of gene expression via their cis-acting elements  or may become targets for epigenetic silencing, which would affect the adjacent gene regions  <cit> . to test if there was a general pattern of regulation of genes by tes, we matched available ests to the predicted genes of the flax genome . the negative correlation of te coverage and gene expression found means that genes in regions that are rich in tes could be affected by their nearby insertion. it is likely that genes in close proximity of tes are affected negatively, because most often these regions are targeted for heterochromatization   <cit>  and te insertion can also cause disruption of genes.

insertions of full ltr elements
most of the non-redundant elements with two identifiable ltrs belonged to the copia superfamily, but a large proportion of retroelements had non-identifiable internal regions, or regions that corresponded to host genes or other non-ltr tes as has also been shown for poplar   <cit> . many of these may constitute either non-autonomous elements, or genes captured by tes. as it turns out, these two concepts are not mutually exclusive. for example, in soybean , an element has been described with an insertion of  <dig>  kb containing a mixture of segments derived from non-coding sequence and disease resistance genes  <cit> . these elements could still be actively driven by autonomous elements if they conserve their ltrs, polypurine tracts , and primer binding sites . many of the undetermined elements in flax had such features , and therefore may still be active. in fact  <dig> of these undetermined elements had 100% ltr pair similarity and  <dig> had at least 99% similarity, meaning these tes constitute relatively recent insertions. it is likely that at least some of the larger flax ltr elements could be classified as lards  which have been characterized in detail in the triticaceae, rice and medicago  <cit> , while some of the shorter than expected ltr retrotransposons are probably tes that have lost their internal coding regions and are usually classified as terminal-repeat retrotransposons in miniature   <cit> . in terms of te sizes, calculated estimates for plants range from 2– <dig>  kb for copia elements, and from  <dig> - <dig> kb for gypsy elements  <cit> . however, a survey of ltr retroelements in rice using ltr_finder found large variation ranges in ltr retrotransposons  <cit>  which is in agreement with the larger variations found in flax . nevertheless our averages agree with the gypsy elements having larger sizes copia as is common in most plants. when comparing the activity of the ltr elements , the copia elements appeared to be increasingly and continuously active in the last  <dig> million years. in the meantime gypsy elements have been active for the last 7– <dig> million years but to a lesser extent than copia and the undetermined elements. in fact, after a peak of activity 3– <dig> mya, gypsy elements have been less active until the present. in comparison, for poplar, the activity of copia full length tes does not seem to overshadow the activity of gypsy elements, but full copia elements are more abundant than gypsy <cit> . although the activity of all these retroelements varies, it is interesting to notice that between  <dig> to  <dig> mya, all of them may have been triggered. it is tempting to speculate that a duplication event of the flax genome may have triggered activity of the retrotransposons, and indeed whole genome duplication in this time frame has been inferred based on molecular phylogenies and analysis of ks distribution in protein coding genes  <cit> . however, rapid turnover of elements is also common  <cit>  and could account for the absence of detection in more ancient evolutionary times since tes may become unrecognizable. when evaluating only the most recent flax ltr element insertions, it was shown that copia ltr elements have more copies, putative expression and are located close to genes. the lone, recently inserted gypsy element had no related ests. a similar insertion pattern was seen in arabidopsis where the number of copia elements with identical ltrs is higher than in gypsy elements, and recent copia insertions are closer to genes than gypsy  <cit> . it can not be ruled out that the short read assembly methodology used for the flax wgs  <cit>  is biased towards more efficient identification of regions surrounding genes. nevertheless we found that gypsy elements followed the opposite trend of copia, meaning that both types of elements were detected, whether they were closely associated with genes or not. this observation and the agreement with other studies on this trend  <cit>  supports our conclusions.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that transposable elements in flax occupied more than 23% of the flax wgs assembly and were dominated by ltr elements. the distribution of tes was not random and there were genomic regions that were enriched by these repetitive sequences, which may constitute heterochromatic sections of the genome. in regions shared by both tes and genes, transposons may have a repressive effect on gene expression as demonstrated by a negative correlation between te coverage and gene expression. overrepresented families in close proximity or overlapping genes were mainly from the dna transposon group, but the copia group was also often localized to the flanking regions of genes. copia retrotransposons have been increasingly active in the last  <dig> million years and have more members with conserved internal domains that contrast with a lower activity and conservation of gypsy elements. it is possible, however, that older insertions are more difficult to tag by the high rate of mutations especially for tes located to heterochromatic regions. because of their recent activity, abundance and diversity, the copia elements are potential shapers of the flax genome. further studies, especially under stress-eliciting conditions, are necessary to understand the regulatory effect on adjacent genes and how their activation patterns may have influenced evolution of other flax species.
