BACKGROUND
in eutherian mammals, the gene responsible for triggering testis development, and hence male sex determination, is sry  which encodes a putative transcription factor containing a high mobility group box dna binding domain. sry initiates the male pathway by triggering the differentiation of sertoli cells in the genital ridge, the precursor of the developing gonad. during normal mammalian development, the tightly regulated spatiotemporal expression of sry within the indifferent genital ridges is required for testis determination to proceed. deregulation of this expression, either via insufficient sry mrna concentrations  <cit> , delayed sry expression  <cit> , expression of different sry isoforms  <cit> , and/or the contribution of autosomal loci  <cit> , can result in partial or complete failure of testis determination and the formation of ovotestes or ovaries within xy individuals. sry expression is now described within the genital ridges of several eutherian mammals . in the mouse, sry mrna is first detected by rt-pcr within the somatic cells of the indifferent genital ridges of male embryos at e <dig> , with a peak of expression seen at e <dig>  followed by a dramatic extinction of expression by e <dig>   <cit> . these results have been confirmed by in situ hybridization  <cit>  and at the protein level  <cit> . expression of the human sry transcript is first seen within the indifferent male genital ridge beginning at  <dig> to  <dig> days post ovulation, corresponding to carnagie stages 17– <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to the mouse, human sry expression is maintained at low levels within the developing testes for the remainder of gestation, a finding supported by immunohistochemistry results  <cit> . the genital ridge expression of sry has now been additionally described for the pig, sheep, dog and goat, and collectively reveals the initiation of sry transcription within the indifferent male genital ridge followed by a gradual trailing off of expression more similar to the human model of expression than to the mouse model  <cit> .

although the essential functional role of sry has been established for some time  <cit> , surprisingly very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate its spatiotemporal expression. the ability of wilms' tumor  <dig>  and the nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor  <dig>  to bind and transactivate the human or pig sry promoters has been demonstrated  <cit> , suggesting that these factors contribute to the tissue-specific expression profile of sry. moreover, more recent data have shown that the sry-related factor sox <dig> can also transactivate the pig sry promoter via a consensus sox <dig> binding site about  <dig> bp upstream of the atg translational start site  <cit> . after the sry gene is turned on, testis differentiation ensues; sertoli cells organize into cord structures that encircle immature germ cells termed gonocytes. at the same time, leydig cells present in the interstitium of the testicular cords differentiate and begin to secrete testosterone. the next stage of male development is sex differentiation, which takes the form of müllerian duct  regression and wolffian duct  development. these events rely on two hormones produced by the fetal testis: testosterone, secreted by leydig cells, and müllerian inhibiting substance , produced by sertoli cells. absence of amh in humans causes persistent müllerian duct syndrome, a form of pseudohermaphroditism characterized by the retention of müllerian duct structures.

the genital ridge expression of amh is described in the human , as well as the mouse  <cit> , pig  <cit> , sheep  <cit>  and dog  <cit> . amh expression is restricted to the pre-sertoli cells of the male genital ridge, always after the initiation of sry expression and commitant to the time of histological testis cord formation. once amh expression is initiated it continues to be expressed at high levels for the duration of the gestational period. the transcriptional regulation of the amh gene has been studied in detail. interestingly, several transcription factors involved in primary sex determination  are also recruited as important regulators of amh transcription  <cit> . much like sry, however, our understanding of how these factors work together to direct the sex-specific expression of the amh gene remains incomplete.

a common regulatory factor important for transcription of the sry and amh genes is wt <dig>  wt <dig> is a zinc finger transcription factor having both dna and rna binding properties  <cit> . there are at least  <dig> different wt <dig> isoforms due to alternative transcription start sites, rna editing, and  <dig> alternative splicing sites. the first alternative splicing site inserts or removes exon  <dig>  which encodes a  <dig> amino acid segment upstream of the zinc fingers. the second alternative splicing site, at the end of exon  <dig>  inserts or removes three amino acids  between zinc fingers  <dig> and  <dig>  previous studies have shown that wt <dig> isoforms with or without the kts tripeptide have distinct biological functions, whereas the alternative splicing site exon  <dig> has a modulatory role on wt <dig> function. although wt <dig> was first identified as a tumor-suppressant gene of wilms' tumor  <cit> , subsequent studies revealed that wt <dig> is also essential for embryonic development, especially the kidney and gonads . in humans, wt <dig> gene mutations are responsible for two urogenital diseases: denys-drash syndrome  and frasier syndrome. dds is caused by exonic point mutations in the wt <dig> gene, and is characterized by mesangial sclerosis with early kidney failure, high risk of wilms' tumor, and varying degrees of gonadal dysgenesis associated with insufficient amh production  <cit> . on the other hand, frasier syndrome, characterized by focal segmental sclerosis, delayed kidney failure and xy gonadal sex reversal, is associated with heterozygous point mutations in intron  <dig> that cause a shift in the ratio of wt <dig> isoforms  towards the -kts forms  <cit> . the importance of wt <dig> during gonad development has also be demonstrated by wt1-null mice, which lack kidneys, gonads, and adrenals  <cit> . moreover, mice lacking the wt <dig> splice variant show complete xy sex reversal and a dramatic reduction in sry expression  <cit> . consistent with a role in sry and amh transcription, in vitro studies have shown that wt <dig> can bind and activate the respective gene promoters  <cit> . however, since wt <dig> starts to be expressed in the developing gonadal primordium of the mouse  somewhat before the sry and amh genes are actually first turned on   <cit> , and since wt <dig> is present in several organs where sry and amh are not, other factors must cooperate with wt <dig>  due to its overlapping expression pattern with wt <dig> in the developing urogenital system  <cit> , gata <dig> is an interesting candidate.

gata <dig> is a member of the gata family of zinc-finger transcription factors that recognize the consensus nucleotide sequence wgatar  in the promoter region of target genes. in the mouse, gata <dig> is strongly expressed in the somatic cell population of the developing gonad prior to and during the time of sex determination  <cit> . this expression pattern coincides with the sry and amh genes  <cit> , suggesting that gata <dig> plays a predominant role in their expression. this hypothesis is supported by in vivo experiments, where mice carrying a gata <dig> mutation that disrupts its ability to interact with its transcriptional partner fog <dig>  display abnormal testis development  <cit> . on a molecular level, this is apparently due to a significant reduction in sry transcription and a block in sox <dig> and amh expression  <cit> . thus gata <dig>  much like wt <dig>  appears to play a predominant role in both primary sex determination and sex differentiation via sry and amh gene regulation. however, since gata <dig> is rather broadly expressed, and more specifically, is found in tissues that do not express either sry or amh, it too cannot account by itself for the tight spatiotemporal expression of these genes. interestingly, the developing gonad is a location where gata <dig> and wt <dig> co-localize with both sry and amh  <cit> . in this study, we provide the first molecular evidence that a physical and functional cooperation between wt <dig> and gata <dig> contributes to the transcriptional regulation of the sry and amh gene promoters.

RESULTS
species-specific regulation of sry promoter activity by gata4
there are multiple consensus gata regulatory motifs within the first  <dig> kilobases of 5' flanking sequences of the mouse, pig, and human sry genes . although numerous gata binding sites are present in the different sry promoters, they are not necessarily species conserved which is to be expected as sry 5' flanking sequences are generally poorly conserved between mammals  <cit> . as shown in fig. 1b, we tested the ability of gata <dig>  at varying doses, to transactivate the sry promoter from these three species by transient transfection assays in the heterologous hela epithelial cell line. hela cells do not express gata <dig> making it a convenient cell line model for promoter regulation studies involving this factor. of the three species tested, the pig sry promoter was the most responsive to gata <dig> with an activation of about 3-fold . this was followed by the mouse sry promoter which was activated by 2-fold in the presence of gata <dig> . this 2-fold activation approached significance but was not significant . interestingly, the human sry promoter was not activated by gata <dig> , and this despite the presence of multiple consensus gata binding motifs and the fact that gata <dig> could be strongly overexpressed in hela cells . similar results were obtained in other heterologous cell lines such as cv- <dig> fibroblasts . the absence or relatively weak ability of gata <dig> to activate the sry promoter suggested that the factor might not bind to sry gata motifs with high affinity. however, emsa analysis revealed the contrary. as shown in fig.  <dig>  gata <dig> was able to strongly bind to all four gata motifs of the proximal pig sry promoter. similar results were obtained with the gata binding elements of the mouse and human sry promoters . thus, the mechanism of gata <dig> in sry gene regulation is unlikely one of direct transcriptional activation by gata <dig> alone.

transcriptional cooperation between gata <dig> and wt <dig> on the sry promoter
although sry 5' flanking sequences are known to be divergent in mammals  <cit> , in addition to gata regulatory motifs,  <dig> partially conserved wt <dig> binding sites are present within the first  <dig> kb of 5' flanking sequences of the mouse, pig, and human sry genes . the sequences of the putative wt <dig> binding sites are shown in fig. 3b. the tcc repeat elements common to the mouse, pig, and human sry sequences have been shown to be recognized by both the -kts and +kts isoforms of wt <dig>  <cit> . the only exception is the human wt <dig> binding site  <dig>  which appears to be preferentially recognized by wt <dig> and not wt <dig>  <cit> . the wt <dig> isoforms, much like gata <dig>  were capable of activating the sry promoter on their own; the magnitude of the activations, however, was greater than gata <dig> being on the order of 10– <dig> fold . since the wt <dig> and gata binding elements lie in close proximity to one another, we tested whether gata <dig> could transcriptionally cooperate with wt <dig> on the sry promoter by performing co-transfection experiments in heterologous hela cells . the three species-specific sry promoter constructs used in the co-transfection experiments contained both wt <dig> binding sites and  <dig> or more consensus gata elements. on the mouse sry promoter, both wt <dig> isoforms strongly synergized with gata <dig> with activations reaching 30-fold . interestingly, the level of gata4/wt <dig> synergism was higher with wt <dig> than with wt <dig>  similar results were also observed on the pig sry promoter where activations reached nearly 50-fold , as well as in other cell lines such as tm <dig> mouse sertoli cells . in contrast to the mouse and pig, the human sry promoter was strongly activated by wt <dig> alone and synergism with gata <dig> only occurred with the wt <dig> isoform . western blot analysis confirmed the heterologous nature of hela cells since they are null for both gata <dig> and wt <dig> . it also showed that the gata4/wt <dig> synergism was not due to variable expression of either gata <dig> or the wt <dig> isoforms since all proteins  were present at similar levels when overexpressed in hela cells .

the proximal wt <dig> binding site is essential for gata4/wt <dig> synergism on the mouse sry promoter
to assess the binding site requirements for transcriptional synergism between gata <dig> and wt <dig>  mouse sry promoter deletion and mutation constructs were prepared and used in co-transfection assays . interestingly, the - <dig> bp sry promoter construct  was synergistically activated by gata <dig> and wt <dig> to the same extent as the full-length  sry construct. this suggests that gata <dig> binding to its consensus sites on the sry promoter is dispensable for maximal synergism with wt <dig>  deletion or mutation of the proximal wt <dig> site, however, abolished the activation by wt <dig> alone and markedly decreased the synergism between gata <dig> and wt <dig> . thus, in contrast to gata <dig>  binding of wt <dig> to its consensus element is critical for gata4/wt <dig> synergism on the mouse sry promoter. interestingly, gata4/wt <dig> synergism was not completely abrogated with the wt <dig> mutant constructs. the remaining synergism is likely due to two low affinity  gata binding motifs present within the - <dig> to - <dig> bp sequence since a further deletion to - <dig> bp eliminated all wt1/gata <dig> synergism . these two gata motifs, named sites a  and b , are unique to the mouse sry promoter sequence. although these sites only weakly bind gata <dig> protein , they are nonetheless functional as revealed by transfection assay . the remaining gata4/wt <dig> synergism observed on the - <dig> bp sry construct harboring the wt <dig> site mutation  was abolished when a truncated wild-type gata <dig> protein  was substituted with two gata <dig> mutants  that we have previously shown to be unable to bind to dna  <cit> . thus, gata <dig> binding to these two low affinity gata motifs likely contributes to the observed gata4/wt <dig> synergism on the mouse sry promoter. we still cannot rule out the possibility, however, of additional unknown regulatory elements  that might be indirectly activated by gata4/wt <dig> overexpression in our heterologous hela cell line model.

in a dna-binding experiment , wt <dig>  binding to a known consensus wt <dig> probe was competed using either unlabeled probe or an oligonucleotide corresponding to the proximal wt <dig> element  of the mouse sry promoter. thus, these results demonstrate that the proximal wt <dig> site  is efficiently bound by both wt <dig> isoforms. the functional importance of the proximal wt <dig> binding site was confirmed using homologous  pgr 9e <dig> cells, a pig genital ridge cell line  <cit> . as shown in fig. 5b, pgr cells express abundant wt <dig> and gata <dig> proteins. transfection studies carried out in this cell line clearly showed that the deletion or mutation of the proximal wt <dig> element reduced sry promoter activity to the same level as the minimal promoter . thus, wt <dig> binding to its proximal site is crucial for full basal activity of the sry promoter. in our sry promoter deletion experiments , we found that gata binding to its consensus motifs was dispensable for maximal gata4/wt <dig> synergism suggesting that gata <dig> cooperates with dna-bound wt <dig>  as shown in fig. 5d, a chip assay using pig pgr cells confirmed that gata <dig> is indeed associated with the endogenous sry promoter in close proximity to the proximal wt <dig> binding site . in contrast, a more distal sry promoter fragment lacking the critical wt <dig> site  could not be amplified.

the zinc finger domains and the c-terminal region of gata <dig> are required for the transcriptional cooperation and physical interaction with wt1
the strong transcriptional cooperation between gata <dig> and wt <dig> on the sry promoter suggests that both factors contact each other through a direct protein-protein interaction. the essential nature of this interaction is all the more evident given that gata <dig> binding to its consensus motifs is not required for maximal synergism with wt <dig> . to map the domains of the gata <dig> protein that interact with wt <dig> and are important for synergism on the sry promoter, a series of truncated gata <dig> proteins were constructed as depicted in fig. 6a. the gata <dig> protein contains two independent activation domains that flank its dna-binding domain. deletion of the n-terminal region  had no significant effect on the transcriptional synergism between gata <dig> and wt <dig> . however, gata4/wt <dig> synergism was lost using proteins consisting solely of the n-terminal region , zinc finger region  or c-terminal domain . thus, the zinc finger and c-terminal domains of the gata <dig> protein are both required for its ability to transcriptionally cooperate with wt <dig>  next, the domain of the gata <dig> protein involved in the direct physical interaction with wt <dig> was mapped using in vitro pull-down assays . consistent with the transcription data , the wt <dig> protein  could physically interact with the intact  gata <dig> protein  but not with mutant gata <dig> proteins that removed the zinc fingers or c-terminal portions of the protein . thus, the zinc finger and c-terminal domains of gata <dig> are also essential for the physical interaction with wt <dig>  the ability of gata <dig> to interact with wt <dig> in the absence of dna-binding was further confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment .

gata4/wt <dig> transcriptional synergism also regulates activity of the amh promoter
since we found in the present study that gata <dig> and wt <dig> could cooperate to regulate transcription from the sry promoter, we surmised that the expression of other gonadal genes might also be modulated by this functional cooperation. another obvious target in the sex determination/sex differentiation pathway is the amh gene since its proximal promoter region contains species-conserved binding elements for both gata <dig> and wt <dig> . both factors are known regulators of amh transcription  <cit> , which is mediated through their direct association with the proximal amh promoter as shown by chip . to better define the role of gata <dig> as a transcriptional partner for wt <dig> in the cell-specific and developmental regulation of the amh gene, we tested whether gata <dig> and wt <dig> could synergistically activate the amh promoter. in our co-transfection experiments, we used the mouse - <dig> bp amh promoter which contains the gata and wt <dig> binding sites in their normal context, as well a series of synthetic constructs containing either gata and/or wt <dig> elements placed upstream of the minimal amh promoter . although crucial for amh transcription in vivo  <cit> , gata <dig> by itself is a poor activator of the amh promoter . while wt <dig> alone weakly activated the amh promoter, and in contrast to the sry promoter, only the -kts isoform was transcriptionally active. in the presence of both proteins, however, a strong synergistic activation was observed not only on the native - <dig> bp amh promoter but also a synthetic reporter consisting of two consensus gata motifs placed upstream of the minimal  amh promoter containing an intact wt <dig> binding element . finally, to assess the binding site requirements for gata4/wt <dig> synergism, mutations or deletions of the amh promoter were generated . although activation by gata <dig> alone was retained using a construct with intact gata motifs but a mutated wt <dig> element, gata4/wt <dig> synergism was lost . similarly, no gata4/wt <dig> synergism was observed on a construct containing an intact wt <dig> binding site but deleted of the gata motifs . thus, again unlike the sry promoter, maximal gata4/wt <dig> synergism on the amh promoter requires both gata <dig> and wt <dig> binding.

a mutated form of wt <dig>  that causes the retention of müllerian ducts in humans fails to synergize with gata4
there are several naturally occurring wt <dig> mutants known to cause male pseudohermaphroditism with retention of müllerian ducts . one of these mutants, wt <dig> r394w, was shown to be a poor activator of the amh promoter  <cit> . to better explain the molecular mechanism behind the human phenotype associated with the mutation, we were interested in verifying whether the wt <dig> r394w mutant could still transcriptionally cooperate with gata <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  the wt <dig> r394w mutant, unlike its wild-type counterpart , not only failed to activate the amh promoter but also failed to synergize with gata <dig>  this lack of synergism was not related to the stability or expression level of the mutant protein . rather, the lack of synergism is most likely attributable to a decrease in dna binding affinity of the mutant wt <dig> protein for its binding element  <cit> . this result therefore supports our previous observation that gata4/wt <dig> synergism on the amh promoter absolutely requires binding of both factors to their respective regulatory elements . thus, a failed transcriptional synergism between gata <dig> and the mutant wt <dig> protein at the level of the amh promoter could be a contributing factor to the improper male sex differentiation seen in wt <dig> r394w patients involving insufficient amh production.

discussion
sry is the genetic trigger for male sex determination in mammals. although its critical developmental function has been established for more than  <dig> years now  <cit> , the molecular mechanisms that regulate its tight spatiotemporal expression in the developing genital ridge have remained elusive. although a number of transcriptional regulators including sf- <dig>  sox <dig> and wt <dig> have been proposed to participate in sry gene regulation  <cit> , the sum of these factors still do not explain its highly restricted expression pattern. we report here, a novel transcriptional cooperation between wt <dig> and the gata <dig> transcription factor. this important cooperation not only markedly enhances transcription from the sry promoter but also targets the promoter of the amh gene involved in male sex differentiation. thus, our data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control the tissue- and developmental-specific expression of these two critical genes and identify gata <dig> as a potential causative factor in cases of abnormal human sex development such as frasier syndrome  and dds syndrome .

in the mouse, gata <dig> is strongly expressed in the somatic cell population of the developing gonad prior to and during the time of sry expression  <cit> ; gata <dig> is also detected in sertoli cells of the early fetal testis in humans  <cit> . moreover, more recent knockout data in the mouse revealed that a functional gata <dig> protein is required for sry expression and hence normal testis cord formation  <cit> , suggesting that gata <dig> is essential for either the onset or up-regulation of sry transcription in the developing male genital ridge. although the sry promoters from mouse, pig and human all contain multiple consensus gata regulatory motifs, only the mouse and especially the pig sry 5' flanking sequences were activated by gata <dig> . this was not surprising knowing that while sry function is highly conserved across all mammalian species, sry promoter regulatory sequences are not. thus, it is entirely conceivable that gata <dig> might directly regulate sry transcription in some mammalian species  but not others . for these other species, gata <dig> likely contributes to sry transcription through interactions with other transcriptional regulators. due to its implication in many clinical cases of abnormal human sex development, an interesting candidate for this gata4-interacting factor is wt <dig>  indeed, a previous study using transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein  under the control of the sry promoter has shown that sry is expressed only in somatic cells of the mouse genital ridge that also co-express gata <dig> and wt <dig>  <cit> . consistent with its role in sry gene regulation, wt <dig> has been reported to activate the sry promoter  <cit> . much like gata <dig>  however, it alone cannot account for the highly restricted sry expression pattern since wt <dig> is found in tissues where sry is not. given the co-localization of gata <dig> and wt <dig> in the genital ridge, we surmised that both factors might cooperate to regulate the sry gene. indeed, gata <dig> strongly synergized with wt <dig> to activate the sry promoter of all three species tested . thus, we propose that sry expression is controlled by a gata4/wt <dig> transcriptional cooperation rather than by the action of gata <dig> or wt <dig> alone. although this mechanism helps us to better understand the proper spatiotemporal expression of the sry gene, other factors must also participate. this includes sox <dig>  sf- <dig>  and especially fog <dig>  fog2-null mice have disrupted testicular development and markedly reduced sry expression  <cit> . fog <dig> was originally cloned as a cofactor for gata <dig> and this interaction is essential for normal testis differentiation  <cit> . although most in vitro studies point to fog <dig> acting as a co-repressor for gata <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> , whether this is actually the case in vivo remains to be shown.

our results provide strong evidence that both the wt <dig> and wt <dig> isoforms act as transcriptional activators of the sry promoter. it is generally accepted, however, that wt <dig> functions as a transcriptional regulator whereas wt <dig> plays a role in other cellular processes, such as rna processing  <cit> . indeed, to date, only a few genes have been identified as potential transcriptional targets of wt <dig>  for example, transactivation of the cdh <dig>  gene, which encodes a calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein, is enhanced by wt <dig>  through gc-rich and caat box sequences  <cit> . moreover, wt <dig> can activate the promoter of the human myc  gene via two wt <dig> binding sites  <cit> . we found that the mouse sry promoter contains two possible wt <dig> binding sites, a distal site at - <dig> bp  and a proximal one at - <dig> bp  upstream of the transcription start site. their sequences are antisense to a tcc-repeat element which has been identified as a binding motif for both wt <dig> and wt <dig>  <cit> . indeed, our results showed that wt <dig> binds to the proximal site  and activates mouse sry promoter activity alone and in association with gata <dig> . thus taken together, although the target genes of wt <dig> are limited in comparison to wt <dig>  wt <dig> nonetheless appears to be an important transcriptional regulator of the sry gene. this is not surprising given that the best known human wt <dig> mutation associated with sex reversal  produces a shift in the wt <dig> +/-kts ratio that favors the -kts isoform  <cit> .

interestingly, the level of gata4/wt <dig> synergism on the sry promoter was much stronger when the wt <dig> isoform was used. importantly, this observation might improve our understanding of sry regulation in mutant mice as reported by hammes et al.  <cit> . they showed that mutant mice that express only wt <dig> or wt <dig> have distinct functions in sex determination and gonad development  <cit> . the mouse mutant lacking the wt <dig> isoform exhibited a reduction in sry expression  leading to a block in testis development. in contrast, the mouse mutant lacking wt <dig> still showed modest expression of male specific genes  downstream of sry, suggesting that wt <dig>  and not wt <dig> is essential for sry expression and consequently normal testis development. we show here that the level of gata4/wt <dig> synergism on the mouse sry promoter was more than twice that of gata4/wt <dig>  thus, our findings suggest that the reduction in sry expression seen in the mouse lacking wt <dig> might be the result of a lack of appropriate gata4/wt <dig> synergism and hence, insufficient activation of the sry promoter. the importance of wt <dig> in male sex determination has also been well-documented in the human since several diseases have been shown to be associated with wt <dig> mutations, such as dds and frasier syndrome. male-to-female sex reversal seen in patients with frasier syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutations in exon  <dig> of wt <dig>  which as previously mentioned, results in reduced levels of the wt <dig> isoform and an concomitant increase in wt <dig>  thus, wt <dig> is believed to be critical for testis determination in the human as in the mouse. contrary to these in vivo data, however, previous reports  <cit> , as well as our present in vitro studies show that the human sry promoter to be comparatively less responsive to wt <dig> than wt <dig>  despite this observation, we found that gata <dig> enhances wt <dig> action on the human sry promoter; an effect that was not observed with the wt <dig> isoform , suggesting that wt <dig> also likely contributes to human sry transcription in cooperation with gata <dig> 

in the mouse, immediately after sex determination , male sex differentiation ensues with the onset of amh expression by the newly differentiated sertoli cells. to date, four transcription factors, all acting within the first  <dig> bp of 5' flanking sequences, have been proposed to be involved in the sex-specific regulation of the amh gene: sf- <dig>  wt <dig>  sox <dig>  and gata <dig>  <cit> . based on several in vitro and in vivo studies  <cit> , up-regulation of amh gene expression in the fetal testis appears to require the presence of both sf- <dig> and wt <dig>  moreover, it has been reported that sox <dig> binding to its specific response element is essential for the initiation of amh transcription  <cit> . studies from our group and others have also shown gata <dig> to be an important player in amh gene regulation  <cit> . we now show that the wt1-dependent regulation of the amh promoter, much like the sry promoter, is markedly enhanced by gata <dig>  an important difference, however, was the promoter-specific response to the wt <dig> isoforms. consistent with previous reports  <cit> , wt <dig> was the transcriptionally active isoform on the amh promoter . thus, wt <dig> and wt <dig> appear to have different actions on the sry and amh promoters as has been described for other wt <dig> target genes involved in the sex determination pathway  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data not only provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the sry and mis genes but also highlight the importance of gata <dig> a key regulator of gonadal development by acting a two levels in the mammalian sex determination and differentiation cascade.
