BACKGROUND
half-smooth tongue sole  is a marine flatfish that belongs to the family cynoglossidae in the order pleuronectiformes, and is widely distributed in chinese coastal water  <cit> . because of its rarity and delicacy, half-smooth tongue sole has been exploited as a commercially important cultured marine fish, especially in the shandong peninsula  <cit> . because female grows 2– <dig> times faster than male, the development of all-female stocks of this fish would be of significant benefit for aquaculture and this fish could be an ideal model for the study on sex-determination mechanisms in teleosts  <cit> . genetic studies, especially on the sex-determining mechanism of this species, have been carried out in the last decade. the chromosomal sex-determining mechanism in half-smooth tongue sole was determined to be female heterogametic with the zw chromosomes  <cit> . a large number of genetic markers  <cit> , especially female-specific amplified fragment length polymorphism  markers have been developed  <cit>  and a large number of ests have been analyzed  <cit> . recently significant progress on the development of gynogenetic stocks  <cit>  and characterization of sex-related genes  <cit>  has been made.

half-smooth tongue sole has a relatively small genome of about  <dig>  mb as estimated by flow cytometry  <cit> . to study the genomics of half-smooth tongue sole, two bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries with an average insert size of 156 kb have been constructed previously  <cit> . meanwhile, microsatellite-based genetic linkage maps with different densities have been constructed, and four quantitative trait loci  related to growth rate, seven sex-related loci and five sex-related markers have been located on the relevant chromosomes  <cit> . these studies have laid the foundation for the future genetic improvement of half-smooth tongue sole. however, no genome-wide physical map has been constructed for half-smooth tongue sole to date, and there are still some difficulties in high-quality assembly of the next generation genome sequencing reads without assistance of a physical map, especially for the w chromosome of this fish due to abundance of repetitive sequences  <cit> .

a physical map of a species is the starting point of the clone-by-clone genome sequencing approach  <cit>  and always constructed as a series of linear orderings of clones in a genomic library using their overlapping. map-based sequencing strategies are expensive and laborious and, as a result, they have partly been replaced by shotgun sequencing strategies  <cit> . however, abundance of repetitive sequences, large gene families and extensive segmental duplications always complicate the assembly of whole-genome shotgun reads obtained from next generation sequencing platforms, and only physical maps can deal with these problems  <cit> . moreover, a genome-wide physical map is also one of the foundations for integration of physical, genetic and cytogenetic maps, and could be used to fine-map economically important genes and/or qtls and evolutionary genomics studies  <cit> . the economically important genes and/or qtls and genome sequence information of a species in agriculture are important foundations of marker-assisted selection breeding and whole genome selection breeding. therefore, the construction of a physical map of the half-smooth tongue sole genome has become essential to complete the final whole-genome sequence assembly as well as to accelerate the progress in genetic improvement programs of this fish.

several fingerprinting methods with bac libraries had been developed, such as agarose gel electrophoresis, dna sequencing electrophoresis and high information content fingerprinting  with snapshot labeling kit  <cit> . each of them had been used to construct physical map for some species. for example, the physical map of human genome was constructed with the method of agarose gel electrophoresis  <cit> , the physical map of soybean genome was constructed with the method of dna sequencing electrophoresis  <cit> , and the physical maps of wheat and brassica rapa genomes were constructed using the method of hicf with snapshot labeling kit  <cit> . now genome physical maps for a number of aquatic species have been also constructed with these different methods. for example, physical maps of threespine sticklebacks  and atlantic salmon  were constructed with the method of agarose gel electrophoresis  <cit> , physical maps of nile tilapia  and zhikong scallop  were constructed with the method of dna sequencing electrophoresis  <cit> , while the method of hicf with snapshot labeling kit has been used to construct physical maps for channel catfish , rainbow trout , asian seabass  and common carp   <cit> .

here we report a first generation bac-based physical map of the half-smooth tongue sole genome constructed with the method of hicf and the fingerprinted contig  program v <dig>   <cit> .

RESULTS
bac fingerprinting and data processing
the hicf method was chosen to develop a physical map of half-smooth tongue sole due to its well-established format with the commercially available snapshot kit  and its high throughput by using the abi 3730xl sequencer   <cit> . a total of  <dig>  clones  mainly from the hindiii bac library were fingerprinted after digestion with a combination of five restriction enzymes. of these fingerprints,  <dig>   were removed by fpminer  <dig>   due to low quality. the remaining  <dig>  valid clones  represented approximately  <dig> -fold coverage of the half-smooth tongue sole genome. the abundance distribution of the restriction bands in all these bac fingerprints is presented in figure  <dig>  on average, each bac clone contained  <dig>  restriction bands, and about 60% of the valid clones contained proper numbers of restriction bands ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and each band represented approximate  <dig>  kb of bac dna fragment, as assessed from the average insert size  of the hindiii bac library  <cit> .

determination of tolerance and cutoff
tolerance and cutoff are two important parameters used in the fpc program for contig assembly. tolerance determines how closely two bands in different clones need to match to be considered as the same band. its value could be set according to the observed size variations of particular bands in the project  <cit> , and the size distributions of the two vector pecbac <dig> fragments  were analyzed . the standard deviations of them in  <dig> randomly selected clones were  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, and the sizes of the 95% confidence intervals were  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp . because the fpc program does not allow the use of decimals and all fragment sizes were multiplied by  <dig>  the tolerance value was set at  <dig>  corresponding to  <dig>  bp of primary fingerprint size. this value was first determined for snapshot-hicf by luo et al. <cit>  and was used in construction of physical maps for several aquatic species  <cit> .

cutoff is a threshold of the probability that fingerprint bands of two clones match by coincidence. lowering cutoff value could increase the stringency of contig assembly and decrease the probability of chimeric joining of duplicated or repetitive regions  <cit> . however, if cutoff value is set too low, some real bac contigs will be split into small contigs or singletons. a series of preliminary tests were performed on the whole data with different cutoff values ranging from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig>  and the observed changes in the numbers of questionable clones , singletons, and contigs versus different cutoff values are presented in additional file  <dig>  along with the decrease of cutoff value from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig>  the number of singletons increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  the number of q clones decreased from  <dig> to  <dig>  when cutoff value was 1e- <dig>  the number of singletons was  <dig>  and the number of q clones was  <dig> . according to the method of brassica rapa physical map assembly, the fraction of clones assembled  was sufficient to give a robust basis for the further assemblies  <cit> . the very low fraction of q clones shown that initial assembly with the cutoff value of 1e- <dig> was reliable. so a cutoff value of 1e- <dig> was reasonably stringent and chosen for the initial assembly.

contig assembly
the physical map contigs of half-smooth tongue sole were assembled using the fpc v <dig>  program with a tolerance of  <dig> and an initial cutoff value of 1e- <dig> in three steps . first,  <dig>  contigs were constructed with  <dig>  clones and  <dig> q clones distributed in  <dig> q contigs were produced in initial assembly. then  <dig> q contigs with more than 10% q clones were broken up by “dqer” function. finally,  <dig>  contigs were end-merged by “end to end” function, and  <dig>  singletons were added to the end of contigs by “keyset to fpc” function at nine successively higher cutoffs from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig>  the average contig length was increased from 233 kb to 539 kb, and the length of the largest contig was increased from 958 kb to  <dig>  kb, while the physical length of the total contigs was decreased from 980 mb to 797 mb, and the genome coverage was also decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these changes suggested that the “end to end” and “keyset to fpc” functions of the fpc program obviously improved the quality of the contig assembly. the final physical map had  <dig>  contigs assembled with a total of  <dig>  bac clones;  <dig> clones remained as singletons. a summary of the half-smooth tongue sole physical map data is presented in table  <dig> 

note: contig assembly was performed with the tolerance of  <dig> and the initial cutoff value of 1e- <dig>  followed by iteration of the end-merge, and singleton-merge routines by means of fpc v <dig> . additional end-merge and singleton-merge routines at 1e- <dig>  1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig> are not shown.

genome coverage
based on the average insert size  of the bac library  <cit> , the valid  <dig>  clones summed up a total of  <dig> .97 mb, which represented  <dig> -fold coverage of the haploid genome of half-smooth tongue sole. though this coverage is smaller than the coverage reported for atlantic salmon  and rainbow trout   <cit> , it is larger than the coverage obtained for nile tilapia , channel catfish , asian seabass , common carp  and zhikong scallop   <cit> . therefore, the  <dig>  valid clones obtained here should be sufficient to construct a practicable and reliable bac-based physical map of half-smooth tongue sole.

there were a total of  <dig>  consensus bands in the final version of contig assembly, representing approximate 797 mb of genome physical length . on average, each bac clone contributed  <dig>  distinct bands or  <dig>  kb linear length to the assembly. the estimated physical length was slightly longer than the size of half-smooth tongue sole genome estimated by the flow cytometry method   <cit> , and was about  <dig> × genome coverage. the longer genome coverage might be due to the overestimation of the average insert size of the bac library, or the heterogeneity of bac dna from three female half-smooth tongue sole fishes. similar results were reported for the physical maps of other species such as nile tilapia , zhikong scallop  and turnip   <cit> . this result also implied that the resultant contigs did not sufficiently overlap with each other and the gaps between the contigs might be closed by additional bac fingerprints or additional rounds of end-merging at lower stringency  <cit> . lower stringency, however, would likely decrease the reliability of the resultant physical contigs and should be performed by manual editing with the assistance of markers.

q clones and q contigs
if a clone contains more than 50% extra bands, which do not actually align to the map, it would be labeled as a q clone even when it is correctly located on the consensus map  <cit> . q clones are generated by inconsistency in enzyme digestion, cross-contamination, abundance of repetitive sequences, and/or extensive segmental duplication, even genome duplication, and its existence could result in a false positive overlap with another clone and even with another contig. q contigs, especially those with more than 10% q clones, are usually broken into two or more contigs to prevent or decrease the chance of chimeric joining. in this study, the initial contig assembly with a cutoff value of 1e- <dig> produced only  <dig> q contigs having more than 10% q clones. the “dqer” function was performed by decreasing the cutoff value as low as 1e- <dig> where necessary and broke up  <dig> q contigs with more than 10% q clones. although the numbers of contigs and singletons increased, the reliability of the resultant contigs should be greatly improved.

in the final version of assembly, there remained a total of  <dig> q clones distributing in  <dig> q contigs, corresponding to  <dig> % of the clones assembled in the physical map. this fraction is much less than the fractions of q clones reported in the physical maps of other species such as channel catfish , rainbow trout , asian sea bass , common carp , maize  and turnip   <cit> . the fraction of q contigs  was also lower than the fraction reported in the maps of other species such as nile tilapia , channel catfish , rainbow trout  and common carp   <cit> . these fractions implied that the chance of false positive overlap in our assembly was substantially lower than these species.

nelson et al. <cit>  demonstrated that most increase of the number of q clones in a map mainly came from the adding of singletons into the ends of contigs. however, in our study, the number of q clones did not increase along with the integration of the  <dig>  singletons into the ends of contigs and remained invariable at the very low level of  <dig>  this finding also suggested that the most of singletons merged in the end of the contigs were from the regions of low coverage.

size distribution of contigs
with the increase of cutoff value from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig>  the average size of the contigs was also increased . the final size distribution of contigs in the physical map of the half-smooth tongue sole genome is shown in figure  <dig>  overall, most of the contigs  contained more than two bac clones,  <dig> % contained more than nine clones, and  <dig> % contained more than  <dig> clones. on average, one contig in the final assembly contained  <dig> bac clones. the largest contig  contained  <dig> bac clones and had a physical length of  <dig>  mb. the n <dig> length of the final assembly was 664 kb and there were  <dig> contigs longer than it. these contigs would be a useful resource for the future integration with linkage map and whole genome sequence assembly.

assessment of the physical map
the half-smooth tongue sole physical map assembly was judged to be reliable preliminarily based on enough genome coverage of valid clones, the very low cutoff value, and the very low fractions of q clones and q contigs. pcr assays of randomly selected contigs were used to further assess the reliability of the physical map assembly. if all clones of a contig truly overlap and belong to the contig, they should be identified by pcr amplification with proper primer pairs, thereby validating the contig  <cit> . twenty-one contigs of various lengths  were randomly selected with consideration of the distribution of the clones end-sequenced. the average length and clone numbers of these contigs were 530 kb and  <dig>  respectively. for short contigs, pcr reactions were performed on all clones of each contig, while for long contigs, reactions were conducted on some near the clones developing primers.

the results of the pcr assays of  <dig> contigs are shown in table  <dig>  all clones of  <dig> contigs were positively identified by the pcr assays with one or multiple pairs of primers, respectively, and an example  is shown in figure  <dig>  fifty-two clones were included in the contig, and five pairs of pcr primers were developed from the end sequences of five clones . all clones near each of these five clones were positively amplified, respectively, and finally all of the  <dig> clones were positively identified. but in ctg <dig>  one clone  could not be positively identified by this way. this negative result might arise from either the lack of proper primers or possible chimeric overlapping during the assembly process. overall,  <dig> of the  <dig> bac clones  in the  <dig> contigs were positively validated, confirming the high accuracy and reliability of the assembly.

CONCLUSIONS
a first generation bac-based physical map of the half-smooth tongue sole genome was constructed with  <dig>   <dig> valid fingerprints  using the method of hicf with snapshot kit and the fpc program v <dig> . a total of  <dig>  bac clones were assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an average length of 537 kb and a n <dig> length of 664 kb. the physical length of the assembled map was 797 mb. the reliability of the map assembly was validated by pcr assays on randomly selected  <dig> contigs. this physical map will promote the assembly of w chromosome and genetic improvement of half-smooth tongue sole.
