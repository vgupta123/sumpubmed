BACKGROUND
epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorder in humans with 1% prevalence and a lifetime incidence of up to 3%; characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures because of an abnormal electrical activity in central nervous system   <cit> . more than  <dig> distinct epilepsy syndromes have been recognized with a broad range of clinical features; roughly it can be divided into idiopathic or symptomatic epilepsies. metabolic disorders, infections, stroke, head trauma or brain tumors may cause symptomatic epilepsy whereas idiopathic seizure occur mainly because of genetic contribution  <cit> . since long, it is observed that idiopathic epilepsy has a genetic component and its genetic etiology can be determined in a small fraction of cases. development of genome wide technologies such as array-cgh and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping enabled the detection of submicroscopic microdeletions and microduplications also known as cnvs  <cit> . cnvs being an important component of human genetic variation are key players in the genetic etiology of numerous neurodevelopmental disorders. a number of studies have recently highlighted the role of cnvs in the etiology of various disorders including autism  <cit> , intellectual disability   <cit>  and schizophrenia  <cit> . recent studies on six genomic regions showed recurrent microdeletions on chromosomes 15q <dig> , 16p <dig>  and 15q <dig>  and were identified as necessary genetic factors influencing idiopathic generalized epilepsy   <cit> . databases of normal and pathogenic genome variations are available on the web and are extremely valuable tools for interpreting cnvs identified in patients . recent studies showed that  <dig> different genomic loci have been associated with well described microdeletion/microduplication syndromes   <cit> ; these informations are constantly updated. in this study, we hypothesized that epilepsy could be caused by cnvs and that genes within those cnvs would be novel candidate genes for epilepsy. we selected a cohort of  <dig> patients with different types of epilepsies and performed high density whole genome array-cgh which showed novel cnvs/genes deletion and duplication that might be the contributory factors in the genetic etiology of epilepsy.

RESULTS
array-cgh results showed gains as well as losses in different genomic regions of  <dig> epilepsy patients from a cohort of  <dig> epilepsy patients. but, we reported the results of only  <dig> patients satisfying the cut off value of duplications and deletions . microduplication of 6p <dig>  was observed in five patients including two from the same family and microdeletion of 7q <dig>  in three patients was also found. these cnv findings were confirmed by qpcr.

detection of 6p <dig>  microduplications
whole genome 2x 400k oligonucleotide based microarray analysis showed  <dig> kb duplication at cytoband 6p <dig> . figure  <dig> presented  <dig> horizontal red lines of  <dig> patients with duplicated regions; each red line is marked with each patients id along with the duplicated region of that specific patient. out of these  <dig> patients,  <dig> were members of the same family whereas the rest of  <dig> were sporadic cases. no deletion or duplication was observed in father:  <dig>  normal daughter:  <dig> and normal son:  <dig> . in affected mother:  <dig>  a microduplication of  <dig> kb  and in affected daughter:  <dig>  a microduplication of  <dig> kb  was observed. rest of  <dig> sporadic cases also showed duplications of different sizes such as  <dig> showed a duplication of  <dig> kb ;  <dig> showed a duplication of  <dig> kb  and  <dig> showed a duplication of  <dig> kb . the gene that was observed in the duplicated region of all the patients is bmp <dig> ; determined by ucsc genome browser  and database of genomic variants . bmp <dig> is a member of bmp family which belongs to transforming growth factor-β  superfamily. it is expressed in hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum  <cit> . studies also showed its expression in developing rat superior cervical ganglion corresponding to initial extension of primary dendrites and in early postnatal period during maximal dendritic growth. immunofluorescence analysis of cultured superior cervical ganglion cells detected bmp <dig> all over cell body of glial  <cit> . it was also observed that cell proliferation was reduced by bmp <dig> through cell death into the progenitor cells specifically in ventral forebrain. insertion of bmp <dig> in developing chicken prosencephalon causes loss of ventral forebrain secondary to immense cell death localized to that region. experimental embryos showed a loss of basal telencephalon due to implantation of beads soaked in recombinant bmp <dig> or bmp <dig> into neural tube of chicken forebrain that resulted in holoprosencephaly , cyclopia  and loss of ventral midline structures  <cit> . noradrenergic  neurons are critical modulators of brain functions and have been implicated in common cns disorders  <cit> . locus coeruleus , the major na nucleus providing the main source of noradrenaline in the brain is formed in rostral hindbrain during embryogenesis. lc development requires either bmp <dig> or bmp <dig> and one is able to compensate the loss of the other. also, the position of mid-hindbrain organizer determines the size of lc and propose that bmp5/ <dig> play an important role in mediating this organizer function  <cit> . studies also uncovered novel roles of bmp signaling during development of heart, allantois, branchial arches, somites and forebrain development. bmp <dig> do not appear to be involved in establishing pattern in these tissues but necessary for proliferation and maintenance of specific cell populations  <cit> . observed duplications in all patients with reference to controls were confirmed by qpcr which showed a significant fold increase in all patients compared to controls figure 3).

detection of 7q <dig>  microdeletions
whole genome 2x 400k oligonucleotide based microarray analysis showed  <dig> kb microdeletion at cytoband 7q <dig> . figure  <dig> showed  <dig> horizontal green lines of  <dig> patients with deleted regions; each green line is marked with each patients id along with the deleted region of that specific patient. in patient  <dig>  a microdeletion of  <dig> kb ; in  <dig>  a microdeletion of  <dig> kb  and in  <dig>  a deletion of  <dig> kb  was observed. the gene that was observed in the deleted regions of all the patients was podxl ; determined by ucsc genome browser  and database of genomic variants . podocalyxin  is type- <dig> membrane mucin protein belongs to cd <dig> family expressed abundantly in kidney epithelial cells   <cit> ; its expression has also reported in the brain with maximum level in cortical plate, hippocampus, cerebellum and basal forebrain nuclei  <cit> . in humans, it is also linked with malignant progression of brain astrocytic tumors  <cit> . studies also showed that ventricles of podxl−/− mice were enlarged in coronal and horizontal brain mr images which were also confirmed through histological analysis of paraffin embedded brain  <cit> . reason of this could be either an enhanced formation or reduced disposal of cerebrospinal fluid  or it might be due to a combination of both mechanisms. enhanced volume of csf might be the result of a new steady state equilibrium of choroid plexuses ion membrane transporters; na+-k+atpase, k+ channels and na+-2cl−-k+ co-transporters expressed in apical membrane and cl−-hco <dig> exchangers, a variety of na+ coupled hco3− transporters and k+-cl− cotransporters expressed in the basolateral membrane  <cit> . further analysis is required to check the involvement of these ion transporters toward ventricles enlargement in the absence of podxl. numerous human pathological disorders are linked with enlarged ventricles such as trauma, autism, bardet-biedl syndrome and alzheimer disease  <cit> . however, an earlier and possibly best human pathological condition studied was schizophrenia  <cit> . finding of enlarged ventricles in the patients having first schizophrenia episode has raised the question of whether this neurodegenerative disease exhibited at the time of symptom onset or it is considered as a neurodevelopmental process which produces abnormal brain volumes at an early age  <cit> . observed deletions in all the patients with reference to controls were confirmed by qpcr which showed a significant fold decrease in all the patients compared to controls .

CONCLUSIONS
cnvs are major contributory factors in developing the neurological disorders and also contribute in the genetic etiology of epilepsy. in this study, we described, for the first time, some of the novel cnvs/genes implicated in epilepsy in the saudi population. our findings present a better description of genetic variations in epilepsy, and could provide a foundation for the understanding of the critical regions of the genome which might be involved in the development of epilepsy. more comprehensive descriptions of patients and identification of possible causative cnvs and genes in the cnv regions will be required to identify new syndromes and improve the diagnoses of epilepsy.
