BACKGROUND
a significant proportion of cultivated land is salt affected representing about 2% of dry-land and 20% of irrigated agriculture . soil salinity arises from natural or human-induced processes that inhibits plant growth via osmotically induced water deficit and/or ion toxicity if excessive sodium  and chloride  accumulate in the shoot via transpiration  <cit> . osmotic stress reduces the ability of the plant to extract water from the soil and growth will reduce rapidly and significantly as salt concentration around the roots increases past a threshold level. ion toxicity occurs when salt  gains entry via the transpiration stream and accumulates in the shoot to toxic concentrations resulting in injury to cells and causing further reductions in growth  <cit> . salt tolerance/sensitivity is indicated by the relative degree of biomass reduction in saline soil compared to plants in a non-saline soil, over an extended period of time  <cit> . clearly water flow is linked to both types of stresses induced by salinity, yet the role of water transport in plant salt tolerance is not yet clearly defined.

plants have evolved three distinct mechanisms of salinity tolerance including osmotic adjustment to allow turgor to be maintained, na+ and cl− exclusion from leaf blades, and compartmentalization of na+ and cl− at cellular or intracellular sites  <cit> . numerous transporters have been identified as likely to be involved in na+ and cl− exclusion and compartmentation  <cit> , but the proteins that transport water across membranes, the aquaporins, are not considered to be directly involved in these processes, though indirect effects could occur through their impact on osmotically driven water flow and pathways for water and solute flow in roots and leaves  <cit> .

the radial flow of water from soil solution toward the root xylem encounters a relatively high resistance compared to subsequent axial flow in the xylem to the shoot. the radial flow pathway in the root consists of the apoplastic pathway along the intracellular spaces and the cell-to-cell pathway, in which water moves through plasmodesmata or across membranes  <cit> . apoplastic water flow can be blocked by casparian bands and suberin lamellae at key cellular barriers such as the endo and exodermis  <cit>  where water transport across membranes occurs. depending on the plant species and conditions, as well as the position along the root, there are variable contributions of the apoplast pathway compared to the cell-to-cell pathway  <cit> . the conductance of the cell-to-cell pathway can be largely determined by the activity of aquaporins   <cit> . aqps are suggested to play a key role in plant water balance and water use efficiency  <cit> .

aquaporins are members of the major intrinsic protein  family, which in plants are divided into five subfamilies that include the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins . these are considered as the main water transport pathway across plasma membranes in root and leaf tissues that play important roles in plant water relations  <cit> . according to the n terminal length of the proteins, the pips are further divided into two subclasses . pip1s require co-expression of pip2s to show high water permeability in xenopus laevis oocytes  <cit> . pip1s and pip2s interact affecting targeting to the plasma membrane  <cit>  and forming hetero-tetramers of variable stoichiometry that appears to affect their transport efficiency  <cit> . plant genomes have variable numbers of aquaporin genes, ranging from  <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> ,  <dig> in oryza sativa <cit>  and  <dig> in soybean, including  <dig> pips <cit> . compared with other species, little is known about the function of aqp genes in soybean.

aquaporins are clearly involved in water transport in roots and leaves  <cit>  and have been linked to water uptake required for cell expansion  <cit> . water is the carrier of na+ and cl− in the transpiration stream contributing to shoot ion toxicity, and in salinity-induced osmotic stress, free energy gradients need to be developed to drive water diffusion to the sites of cell expansion. in this context aquaporins could affect the root’s ion selectivity by determining the proportion of water that flows via membrane pathways relative to the apoplast, while in osmotic stress, they could allow continued water supply under diminished osmotic and pressure gradients by increasing membrane hydraulic conductivity.

abiotic stresses such as salt, drought and cold influence the water balance of plants and the expression of aqp genes  <cit> . overexpression of several aqp genes in plants confers abiotic stress resistance. overexpressing ntaqp <dig> in tobacco increased photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency and yield under salt stress  <cit> . overexpression of several wheat aqps, including tanip, taaqp <dig> and taaqp <dig> genes in arabidopsis or tobacco also increased salt tolerance or drought tolerance of the transgenic plants  <cit> . recently, overexpression a musapip1; <dig> in banana displayed high tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses including salt, cold and drought  <cit> .

soybean is a major source of protein and oil for humans and animals, yet relatively mild salt stress significantly reduces soybean growth, nodulation, seed quality and yield  <cit> . recently it was found that the expression of gmpip1; <dig> in roots correlated with rapid and longer term changes in root lo in response to shoot treatments and appeared to be more concentrated in stellar tissue  <cit> . these results indicated that gmpip1; <dig> may be important in the control of root water transport particularly in response to shoot signals. in this study, gmpip1; <dig> was cloned and functionally characterized. overexpression of gmpip1; <dig> significantly increased salt tolerance of soybean by improving root lo and na+ exclusion.

RESULTS
subcellular localization of gmpip1;6
in soybean, gmpip1; <dig> was proposed to be one of the major water transporter genes in roots  <cit> . the full-length cdna of gmpip1; <dig>  was amplified from soybean roots cultivar williams  <dig> by pcr. the cdna of gmpip1; <dig> is comprised of  <dig> bp with an  <dig> bp open reading frame. the gmpip1; <dig> belongs to the pip <dig> subgroup and has an orthologous gene, gmpip1; <dig>  in the soybean genome . gmpip1; <dig> protein contains the characteristic motifs of pips and is predicted to be localized on the plasma membrane. to verify the subcellular localization of gmpip1; <dig>  the gmpip1; <dig> was fused with green fluorescent protein  and driven by a constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter . the final construct gmpip1;6::gfp was transiently co-expressed in onion epidermal cells and compared with the mcherry plasma membrane marker . gfp fluorescence of gmpip1; <dig> was confined to the plasma membrane and co-localized with the rfp fluorescence of mcherry. when the control construct with gfp alone was transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells, the gfp fluorescence was observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm .

expression patterns of gmpip1;6
to analyze gmpip1; <dig> gene expression in different soybean tissues, we measured the expression of gmpip1; <dig> in root, stem, unifoliolate leaf, trifoliolate leaf, flower and pod by quantitative rt-pcr. this showed that gmpip1; <dig> was highly expressed in root, stem, flower and pod whereas it was lowly expressed in leaves . to investigate the response of gmpip1; <dig> to salt stress, we determined expression of gmpip1; <dig> in root and leaf after  <dig> mm nacl treatment for  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours,  <dig> day,  <dig> days and  <dig> days. the expression of gmpip1; <dig> was suppressed by nacl treatment in  <dig> and  <dig> hours in both roots and leaves. however, expression was induced in the roots after  <dig> day and further increased at  <dig> days and  <dig> days of nacl treatment . a similar response was observed in the leaves although the absolute expression of gmpip1; <dig> was much lower than that of the roots .

generation of transgenic soybean overexpressing gmpip1;6
to characterize the role of gmpip1; <dig> in salt stress, the cdna of gmpip1; <dig> driven by a modified camv 35s promoter was introduced into soybean via soybean cotyledonary node transformation system . positive transgenic lines were selected by spraying the herbicide liberty . a total of  <dig> independent lines which overexpressed gmpip1; <dig> were generated and confirmed by semi-qrt pcr . two transgenic lines were selected and measured by qrt-pcr. these two lines, which showed more than 100-fold higher expression levels of gmpip1; <dig> than wt control in leaves , were selected for further experiments.

overexpression of gmpip1; <dig> enhances salt tolerance in soybean
the growth of wt and gmpip1;6-oe transgenic soybean plants were similar when grown in aerated hydroponic solution . for salt tolerance analysis, 10-day-old wt and gmpip1;6-oe transgenic seedlings were treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> days. salt treatment suppressed the growth of wt and gmpip1;6-oe transgenic soybean plants, all of which exhibited a decreased plant length and fresh weight in both leaves and roots . however, the leaves of wt plants turned yellow after treatment for  <dig> days while the leaves of transgenic plants were still green . the relative measure of leaf greenness was carried out with a portable chlorophyll meter. soil-plant analyser development  values of unifoliolate leaf in gmpip1;6-oe were significantly higher than wt under salt stressed condition . moreover, the shoot length and fresh weight of gmpip1;6-oe transgenic soybean were significantly higher than that of wt plants under salt stressed conditions . these results indicated that gmpip1;6-oe plants were more tolerant to salt stress than wt plants.

ten-day-old wt and gmpip1;6-oe transgenic soybean plants were treated with or without  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> days. length and fresh weight of shoot and root of wt and transgenic plants were measured. data are given as means ± sd . different letters indicate significant differences .

overexpression of gmpip1; <dig> increased photosynthesis and root water conductance in soybean under salt stress conditions
the impact of gmpip1; <dig> overexpression on net assimilation  under saturating light, stomata conductance  and transpiration rate  were measured using an infrared gas analyser  under normal and salt treatment conditions. diurnal photosynthesis of soybean was measured every  <dig> hours in a light period from 8: <dig> am to 4: <dig> pm. as expected, the an, gs and tr showed diurnal changes and peaked at about 2: <dig> pm in both wt and gmpip1;6-oe plants . under normal growth conditions, gmpip1;6-oe plants showed significantly higher an, gs and tr than that of wt at all the time points measured . we then took the values of an, gs and tr at 2: <dig> pm to compare wt and gmpip1;6-oe plants. under normal growth conditions, an, gs and tr was significantly increased in gmpip1;6-oe plants than that of wt plants . interestingly, the an, gs and tr was more than 2-fold higher in gmpip1;6-oe <dig> plants compared with that of wt under salt treatment. in the other transgenic line, gmpip1;6-oe <dig>  the an, gs and tr were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold higher than that of wt . these results indicated that overexpression of gmpip1; <dig> increased photosynthetic activity and stomatal conductance, especially under saline conditions.

ten-day-old wt and gmpip1;6-oe transgenic soybean plants were treated with or without  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> days. data are given as means ± sd . different letters indicate significant differences .

under normal conditions, the substomatal concentration of co <dig>  of gmpip1;6-oe was lower than that of wt though no significant difference was observed. in contrast, the ci of gmpip1;6-oe was significantly lower than that of wt under salt treatment . this is in accordance with the higher rate of net photosynthesis of gmpip1;6-oe compared to wt plants under saline conditions. instantaneous water use efficiency  was significantly increased in gmpip1;6-oe plants under both normal and salt stress conditions compared with wt . changing stomata density and/or pore area will influence the gs and tr. examination of the abaxial leaf surface revealed a significantly wider stomatal aperture in gmpip1;6-oe plants under both normal and salt stress conditions while the stomata density was not changed . as a result, the water loss rate was increased in the transgenic plants compared with wt plants .

we also measured root hydraulic conductance , normalized to root dry weight, in gmpip1;6-oe and wt plants. interestingly the lo was similar between gmpip1;6-oe and wt plants irrigated with nutrient solution. however when irrigated with nutrient solution containing  <dig> mm nacl, lo of wt plants decreased almost 50% while lo of gmpip1;6-oe plants remained unchanged .

overexpression of gmpip1; <dig> affects na uptake and exclusion of transgenic plants under salt stress
the sodium concentration of plants was analyzed under normal and salt stress conditions. sodium  concentration was similar between wt and gmpip1;6-oe plants in roots and leaves under normal conditions . salt treatment increased na+ concentration in the roots and leaves of both wt and gmpip1;6-oe plants. however, the na+ concentration was significantly lower in the leaves of gmpip1;6-oe plants than wt plants under salt stress . we examined relative na+ exclusion of wt and gmpip1;6-oe plants after salt treatment revealing that the relative exclusion of na+ from the shoot of gmpip1;6-oe plants was higher relative to wt . moreover, salt treatment induced the expression of gmnhx <dig> in the leaves and roots of wt but not in gmpip1;6-oe plants .

overexpression of gmpip1; <dig> increased yields of soybean in the field
four independent gmpip1;6-oe lines, where two of these lines were the same as the ones used in the physiology experiments, were grown in field conditions for an entire growing season in two continuous years. each year, the transgenic plants were compared with wt and null transgenic plants, which were segregated from heterozygous transgenic plants. interestingly, gmpip1;6-oe plants have a significantly higher seed weight per plant and per  <dig> seeds than wt . other yield parameters were similar between wt and gmpip1;6-oe plants . a detailed analysis showed that the increased seed weight of gmpip1;6-oe plants was caused by large seed size .

data are given as means ± sd . different letters indicate significant differences .

discussion
recently,  <dig> aqp genes were identified in soybean by a genome wide analysis  <cit> . the gmpip subfamily contained  <dig> pip <dig> genes and  <dig> pip <dig> genes, all of which were predicted to localize on the plasma membrane. it is found that pip <dig> aquaporins when expressed in xenopus oocytes have high water permeability while pip <dig> aquaporins do not. however, pip <dig> aquaporins can work cooperatively with pip2s in targeting to the plasma membrane and in water permeation as heterotetramers  <cit> . this is accordance with the fact that gmpip1; <dig> protein fused with gfp localized on the plasma membrane .

gmpip1; <dig> is the ortholog of atpip1; <dig>  ntaqp <dig>  hvpip1;6/1; <dig> and taaqp <dig> in arabidopsis, tobacco, barley and wheat . atpip1; <dig> and ntaqp <dig> play a key role in regulating root hydraulic conductance  in arabidopsis and tobacco  <cit> , respectively. in situ pcr showed that gmpip1; <dig> was highly expressed in the stellar region of the root  <cit> , which is similar as ntaqp <dig>  shoot topping rapidly decreased root hydraulic conductance  by 50% to 60%, which is correlated with the reduced expression of gmpip1; <dig> in roots of soybean. therefore, gmpip1; <dig> was suggested to control the lo as atpip1; <dig> and ntaqp <dig> 

water stress caused by drought, salt or cold has a complex effect on the expression of aqp genes  <cit> . in summary, the expression of aqp genes could be divided into two stages. in the early stress response, the plant usually suppresses the expression of pip genes, which is hypothesised to avoid water flow from the root to the soil when the soil water potential decreases  <cit> . after a few days of acclimation, the expression of pip genes recovers or even increases and is correlated with increased hydraulic conductance  <cit> . the expression of gmpip1; <dig> in both roots and leaves showed this two stage response under salt stress , indicating gmpip1; <dig> may be involved in the salt stress acclimation of soybean.

overexpression of several pip <dig> genes increased the hydraulic conductance and salt tolerance of the transgenic plants, such as ntaqp <dig>  ospip1; <dig>  taaqp <dig> and musapip1; <dig> <cit> . here we show that gmpip1; <dig> conferred salt tolerance, but also under normal conditions the overexpression resulted in higher growth and greater yield under field conditions compared to wt plants . however, the mechanism of how these pip <dig> genes can improve plant growth and salt tolerance is largely unknown, though a high k+/na+ ratio was mentioned with overexpression of taaqp <dig> <cit> .

it is highly unlikely that gmpip1; <dig> can transport na+, therefore salt tolerance of transgenic gmpip1; <dig> plants is more likely to occur through indirect mechanisms: first, improvement in water uptake by roots and leaf cell hydration, could improve energy capture and conversion by leaves. greater energy availability in turn could improve na+ exclusion by roots and improve tissue na+ compartmentalization  <cit> . we compared the root lo of wt and gmpip1;6-oe plants under normal and salt stressed conditions . as expected, nacl treatment decreased lo by 50% in wt plants. in contrast, gmpip1;6-oe plants maintained lo under salt stress conditions. therefore, gmpip1;6-oe plants may have a higher water uptake activity than wt plants under saline conditions. secondly, na+ is transported to shoots in the transpiration stream through the xylem, but it can return to root via the phloem  <cit> . export of na+ from leaves in the phloem could conceivably help to maintain low salt concentration in the leaves and may be enhanced by greater water permeability in phloem cells. also we show that net assimilation and gas exchange are enhanced in the gmpip1;6-oe plants, and especially so under saline conditions compared to wt. this would potentially translate to a higher capacity to exclude na+ via energy demanding salt exclusion mechanisms in the roots and the leaves. thirdly, we measured the expression of gmnhx <dig> <cit>  to analyze the effect of na+ compartmentalization in the vacuole . salt treatment induced the expression of gmnhx <dig> in the leaves and roots of wt but not in gmpip1;6-oe plants. this is accordance with the lower na+ concentration of gmpip1;6-oe plants and indicated that vacuole compartmentalization of gmpip1;6-oe plants was not necessarily enhanced.

another possibility that may account for reduced na+ transport to the shoot in the over expressing plants could be that more water flow occurs radially across roots via the cell-to-cell  pathway, as opposed to the apoplast pathway. this would occur because of the higher activity of gmpip1; <dig> in root membranes under salinity stress demonstrated by the higher root lo compared to wt. a higher proportion of water flow via the membrane pathway in roots would confer a greater degree of ion selectivity relative to flow in the apoplast pathway. altogether, we clarified that overexpression of gmpip1; <dig> increased soybean salt tolerance by maintaining water uptake ability and na+ exclusion.

in addition to function as a water channel, atpip1; <dig> and ntaqp <dig> may function to facilitate co <dig> transport and enhance photosynthesis by increasing the mesophyll conductance to co <dig> diffusion  <cit> . overexpression of ntaqp <dig> in tobacco and tomato increased the an, which resulted in increased wue. the overexpression of ntaqp <dig> produced higher dry biomass and yield under normal irrigation and salt stressed conditions  <cit> . gmpip1;6-oe plants also exhibited higher an, gs and iwue than wt under both normal and saline conditions . however, the growth of gmpip1;6-oe plants was only enhanced under saline conditions compared to wt plants . whether gmpip1; <dig> has a similar function as ntaqp <dig> to facilitate co <dig> diffusion across leaf cell membranes requires further research.

importantly, gmpip1;6-oe plants showed higher yield in the field than wt because the seed weight and size of gmpip1;6-oe were increased . this may be reflecting the higher net assimilation, but also may indicate sink limitation of seed loading that could be enhanced by greater water permeability in the seed loading process  <cit> . in addition to being highly expressed in roots and stems, the transcripts of gmpip1;6-oe were abundant in flower and pod, which supports a role of gmpip1;6-oe in seed loading of assimilates via enhanced water permeability.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the function of gmpip1; <dig> was analyzed by constitutive expressing in the soybean plants. the expression of gmpip1; <dig> was influenced by salt stress. overexpression of gmpip1; <dig> improved salt tolerance of transgenic plants by increasing water transport, photosynthesis and na+ exclusion. moreover, the yield of gmpip1; <dig> overexpression plants was improved in the field indicating the potential of gmpip1; <dig> in genetic engineering of soybean.
