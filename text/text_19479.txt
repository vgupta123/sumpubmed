BACKGROUND
mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase  <dig>  gene are the most common known cause for sporadic and familial parkinson's disease   <cit> . the most frequent mutation in north america and europe is a glycine to serine substitution at residue  <dig>  in the lrrk <dig> protein which accounts for up to 10% in familial cases and up to 2% in sporadic cases  <cit> . frequencies of lrrk <dig> mutations in pd cases are reported as high as 40% in north africans and ashkenazi jews  <cit> , but since penetrance of the mutation in  <dig> year old carriers may be as low as 30% with standard diagnosis  <cit>  the discrimination between familial and sporadic disease becomes difficult  <cit> . lrrk <dig> mutation carriers present with similar clinical and neurochemical features to sporadic disease, and with only few exceptions, present with typical lewy body pathology  <cit> .

due to the unprecedented frequency of mutations in lrrk <dig> occurring in pd, a number of laboratories have embarked on the development of lrrk2-null and lrrk <dig> transgenic animals. in multiple-tissue northern blots, lrrk <dig> is nearly constitutively expressed but the timing of expression has not been described nor the profile of the related lrrk <dig> gene  <cit> . given the sequence similarity between lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig>  a complete expression profile may indicate whether redundancy in function could mask a phenotype in transgenic and knock-out animals. in addition, inappropriate expression in transgenic animals due to off-tissue expression or abnormal developmental expression may initiate undesirable phenotypes and reduce the utility as a pd model. to provide the complete expression profile of lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig>  we utilize quantitative pcr, northern blot and western blot experiments to track levels of expression.

the  <dig> amino acid multi-domain protein kinase lrrk <dig> is associated with membranes in rodent brain and is present in tissues relevant to pd in human and rodent brain  <cit> . some studies suggest the presence of lrrk <dig> protein in disease-associated aggregations such as lewy bodies and lewy neurites, using different antibodies against human lrrk <dig>  <cit> . to aid the neurodegeneration research community we present a detailed characterization of twenty-one commercially available antibodies to mouse and human lrrk <dig> purported as specific to the  <dig> kda protein.

RESULTS
lrrk <dig> is present in both freely soluble and sds-soluble fractions of mouse brain lysate as determined by antibody jh5514
published literature to date suggests many commercially available antibodies raised against peptides derived from human lrrk <dig> sequence detect a protein of approximately  <dig> kda in size in mouse or human tissue and/or cell lines  <cit> . to confirm whether these antibodies detect mouse lrrk <dig> or cross-reactive protein species unrelated to lrrk <dig> migrating near  <dig> kda, we performed immunoblot analyses of the various antibodies in wild type mice and lrrk <dig> knock-out mice in which exons  <dig> and  <dig> are disrupted  . our previously characterized antibody jh <dig> recognizes human over-expressed and endogenous lrrk <dig> protein in mouse and humans with minimal cross-reactivity with other protein species and lrrk <dig> immunoreactivity is absent in lrrk <dig> ko mice . no endogenous lrrk <dig> can be detected in hek-293t cells even with long exposures and high antibody concentrations . our validated antibody jh <dig> does not detect a protein of the appropriate size, determined through alignment with recombinant lrrk <dig> protein, in any tested cell line lysate including human embryonic kidney  cells, human neuroblastoma  cells, human neuroblastoma -m17) cells and rat adrenal  cells . several of these cell lines, including hek-293t and sh-sy5y express a low level of lrrk <dig> mrna compared with brain tissue suggesting post-transcriptional regulation .

with a series of different extraction buffers for mouse brain using lrrk2-null brain tissue as a control, we show that membrane disruption through simple mechanical homogenization of brain tissue in pbs  or in high salt buffer is sufficient to extract the majority of mouse lrrk <dig> that can be detected by western blot . mouse lrrk <dig> protein is also detected in relatively insoluble fractions only resolved through the addition of 1% sds buffer. incubation of lysate samples supplemented with 1× laemmli sample buffer for ten minutes at temperatures above room temperature led to a loss of recoverable levels of lrrk <dig> . this phenomenon is apparently not due to an interaction with plastic disposables since siliconized tubes and tips had no effect. supplementation of the sample buffer lysate solution with either  <dig> m urea or 5% formic acid  after incubation for ten minutes at 90°c resulted in a significant recovery of lrrk <dig> protein levels, suggesting that lrrk <dig> may form sds-resistant insoluble aggregates with elevated temperatures .

commercially available antibodies that recognize over-expressed and endogenous mouse lrrk2
using a panel of over-expressed mouse lrrk <dig>  versus empty vector transfected hek-293t cells in combination with lrrk2-null versus wild-type mouse brain tissue, we tested twenty-one commercially available lrrk <dig> antibodies to determine specificity. most of the antibodies cannot detect over-expressed mlrrk <dig> or endogenous wild-type mlrrk <dig> protein . for example, the antibodies novus  <dig>  novus  <dig>  abgent ap7099b do not have the sufficient specificity to detect mlrrk <dig>  either over-expressed or endogenous using standard blotting conditions . of note, antibody ap7099b from abgent was raised against a peptide identical between mouse and human. typical for the majority of antibodies tested here, cross-reactive species near the molecular weight of lrrk <dig> protein confound the interpretation of blots when appropriate controls such as lrrk2-null brain lysate are not included. with very high concentrations and exposure times, many cross reactive bands appear near the expected size of lrrk <dig> protein but none are changed in the lrrk2-null brain lysate for all commercially available antibodies with the exception of the alexis  antibody, which recognizes a faint band immediately under a prominent cross-reactive protein species near  <dig> kda . other antibodies capable of detecting over-expressed mlrrk <dig> in hek 293t cells such as the cell signaling  and chemicon  antibodies recognize cross-reactive protein species that presumably mask endogenous mlrrk <dig> protein due to the insufficient separation afforded by commercially available gradient mini-gels.

summary of the results of commercially available antibodies against lrrk <dig> tested on western blot. a  denotes antibodies that produce a discernable band specific to lrrk <dig> protein. a  denotes antibodies unable to detect a band specific to lrrk <dig> protein. antibodies were designed against the human sequence unless otherwise indicated.

commercially available antibodies that recognize over-expressed and endogenous human lrrk2
all antibodies were additionally tested on human over-expressed lrrk <dig> versus empty vector transfected hek-293t cells . figure 2a shows the panel of antibodies capable of detecting over-expressed human lrrk <dig> . we tested antibodies capable of robustly detecting over-expressed human lrrk <dig> protein  using human brain lysate derived from fresh-frozen samples of human temporal lobe. in situ hybridization analyses have previously demonstrated lrrk <dig> mrna is at the highest levels in the cortex and striatum and we would expect significant quantities of lrrk <dig> protein in the temporal lobe  <cit> . novus  <dig>  novus  <dig> and ap7099e all have sufficient specificity to detect human lrrk <dig> based on their ability to resolve a band of the predicted molecular weight of lrrk <dig> with identical solubility profiles . novus  <dig> and ap7099e are shown in comparison with our in-house antibody jh <dig> . using gel systems other than tris-glycine such as tris-acetate or bis-tris gels causes a dramatically different migration of lrrk <dig> protein with respect to protein markers, with migration near  <dig> kda in tris-acetate gels .

we visualized lrrk <dig> protein by western blot in human brain lysates derived from tissue with minimal delay in processing  and have been unsuccessful in detecting lrrk <dig> protein from the vast majority of archived frozen brain samples that correspond to typical post-mortem delays  . this may be due to a high rate of degradation or processes that otherwise render lrrk <dig> inaccessible to detection by immunoblotting due to typical post-mortem delay in most human tissue samples available. we have not observed significant decay in lrrk <dig> protein within protein lysate when stored at - <dig> or - <dig> degrees or dramatic loss of lrrk <dig> due to freeze/thaw cycles .

lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> expression in development and adulthood
many invertebrate organisms such as drosophila and lower vertebrate organisms such as fugu and zebrafish possess only a single lrrk gene, suggesting mammalian lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> protein diverged from a single founder  <cit> . lrrk-like proteins and orthologues extend well beyond complex invertebrates into even simple single-celled eukaryotic organisms  <cit> , suggesting a fundamental albeit unknown role for the lrrk family of proteins in mammals. northern blot analysis has previously shown a broad distribution of lrrk <dig> mrna in the brain and other organs in humans  <cit> . in order to better understand the regulation of lrrk <dig> expression we measured lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> mrna in multiple organs in neonatal and adult mice . we observed statistically identical levels of lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> mrna in the lung, heart, skeletal muscle and lymph node . lrrk <dig> mrna is more abundant in kidney and brain tissue, whereas lrrk <dig> mrna is more abundant in the gut.

using northern  and western  blotting we show that lrrk <dig> does not have an expression profile typical of a gene important during early development . mrna levels measured from whole mouse embryos show that lrrk <dig> expression increases from embryonic day  <dig> to day  <dig> . given the large increase in expression of lrrk <dig> during the latest stages of development, we created a panel of cdna derived from developing mouse organs, including brain, lung, heart and liver, at various stages of development. we then went on to compare lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> levels using quantitative rt-pcr and observed a dynamic expression profile that distinguishes lrrk <dig> from lrrk <dig>  lrrk <dig> most dramatically increases in lung and kidney between e <dig>  and e <dig>  partially accounting for the results of the whole-embryo northern blot. surprisingly, lrrk <dig> mrna is constitutively expressed early in development of the brain and does not substantially increase upon cell maturation as might be expected by the northern blot of whole embryo . lrrk <dig> levels spike at e <dig>  in the brain then decrease below lrrk <dig> levels and remain low with respect to lrrk <dig> throughout adulthood. in other organs such as the lung and liver, lrrk <dig> dramatically increases in the latest stages of development in contrast to the more constitutive expression in the heart where lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> are nearly identically expressed both in development and throughout adulthood.

discussion
the function of lrrk proteins in mammals remains enigmatic yet strong evolutionary conservation suggests important roles. besides obvious interest in understanding the only proteins in the mammalian proteome encoding both a kinase and gtpase domain, the striking association between lrrk <dig> and pd further justifies the speedy discovery of lrrk <dig> protein function in cells. within the present study we show that several commercially available antibodies recognize endogenous human lrrk <dig> protein but no tested commercially available antibody can efficiently resolve mouse lrrk <dig> protein despite a number of reports that did not have the benefit of lrrk2-null mice. to the contrary, more abundant cross-reactive species near or at the molecular weight of mlrrk <dig> protein are detected by most commercially available antibodies as shown for the human specific novus antibodies and the abgent antibody ap7099b. cross-reactive species likely mask endogenous mlrrk <dig> protein in the case of antibodies from cell signaling and chemicon. however, both antibodies are capable of detecting over-expressed mouse protein. the alexis antibody detects over-expressed mouse protein and endogenous mouse protein that migrates slightly below cross-reactive species. it may be possible with additional purification steps, blocking optimization, extraction optimization and improved washing and blotting conditions that some of the antibodies tested here will prove useful in the future.

in all tissues, lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> mrna is rare compared to even nominally expressed transcripts such as tata binding protein  and cyclophilin-a, both used here in addition to gapdh as normalization controls. the combination of a poorly expressed transcript with an apparently unstable protein of above-average size creates a worst case scenario for routine detection of endogenous protein by western blotting and immunocytochemistry despite the high solubility of lrrk <dig> protein.

we describe cloning of mouse lrrk <dig> into expression vectors and the expression profile of lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> in the developing and adult mouse. mouse lrrk <dig> expression increases from embryonic day  <dig> to day  <dig> and continues through adulthood. in some organs, such as the brain, lrrk <dig> expression apparently increases to a more nominal extent at earlier time points. we have been unable to detect lrrk <dig> protein in the brain before embryonic day  <dig> using the western blotting conditions and protein extraction protocols described here. lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> expression overlaps in all tissues used in this study , and in some tissues expression levels are identical. lrrk <dig> expression levels are particularly high in embryonic and adult lung and kidney. as kinase enzymes, lrrk protein may target tissue specific substrates for phosphorylation. it is possible that lrrk protein is so critical to cell function that the protein has diverged into two related proteins to provide a protective measure of redundancy in function.

CONCLUSIONS
knowledge about localization, function and substrates of lrrk <dig> and  <dig> protein will help clarify lrrk <dig> associated disease. we characterized twenty-one commercially available antibodies against lrrk <dig> protein and describe the biochemical properties of mouse and human lrrk <dig> proteins with regards to solubility and expression. the importance of lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> for mouse development and adult mice in different tissues is actively pursed by many research groups. lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> are comparably expressed in most tissues with stable expression in adulthood but dynamic expression during development, with a general trend towards increased expression during organogenesis and maturation.
