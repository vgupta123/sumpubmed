BACKGROUND
the lack of genomic and transcriptomic sequence information for agaves, succulent plants native to the arid regions of north america, limits molecular investigation of their adaptations to the abiotic stresses of xeric environments. agaves are remarkably resistant to heat and drought stress as they employ crassulacean acid metabolism —a water-efficient form of photosynthesis in which the uptake of co <dig> into plant tissues through stomata and the fixation of co <dig> into organic molecules is temporally separated  <cit> . cam plants have high water use efficiency, 4–2x more efficient in water use efficiency than plants employing c <dig> and c <dig> photosynthesis  <cit> . moreover, an increased co <dig> concentration within cam plant cells increases the efficiency of carbon fixation by rubisco  <cit> . agaves exhibit equally important morphological adaptations to xeric environments that further increase their drought and heat resistance  <cit> . specialized leaves  <cit> , cuticles  <cit> , and roots  <cit>  further protect agaves from thermal damage and prolonged drought. agaves thus offer an opportunity to study broad-spectrum heat and drought resistance not necessarily present in all cam plants, and provide an important model for creating applied solutions to agricultural challenges associated with climate change  <cit> . because of adaptations to arid environments  <cit> , agaves have also recently been proposed as a lignocellulosic bioenergy feedstock suitable for marginal land  <cit> .

to date, the ecology and physiology of two agave species, a. tequilana  and a. deserti , have been studied most extensively. agave tequilana weber var. azul, colloquially known as the blue agave, is cultivated in western mexico for the production of the distilled spirit tequila  <cit> . a. tequilana is of both cultural  <cit>  and economic importance to mexico, representing $ <dig>  billion in annual revenue within the united states alone  <cit> . because of its productivity, established agricultural practices, and ethanol conversion technologies, a. tequilana and its close relatives represent some of the most promising agave species for bioenergy  <cit> . agave deserti, subject of numerous ecological and physiological studies [reviewed in  <cit> , is native to the sonoran desert regions of the southwestern united states and northwestern mexico  <cit>  and grows within elevation ranges that experience both hot, dry summers and occasional freezing temperatures in winter  <cit> . adapted to the conditions of its native habitat, a. deserti displays exceptional drought and temperature tolerance. mature a. deserti plants survive up to a year without rainfall  <cit> , and, in side-by-side comparisons with  <dig> other agave species, a. deserti displays the largest range of thermotolerance, surviving a temperature range of  <dig> °c   <cit> . while a. deserti is comparatively smaller and slower-growing than a. tequilana, it provides a valuable model to study molecular and physiological mechanisms of plant drought and heat resistance  <cit> .

agaves have large genomes, estimated to be around  <dig> gbp  <cit>  with a significant amount of gene duplication due to paleopolyploidy  <cit>  and a high number of repetitive elements  <cit> , presenting significant challenges for genome assembly. to provide a comprehensive and accurate foundation for molecular studies of agaves, herein we present reference transcriptome datasets of a. tequilana and a. deserti, assembled from deep rna-seq data. cross-species comparisons demonstrate high depth and accuracy of the agave de novo assemblies. comparative transcriptome profiling provides insights into the molecular and physiological functions along the proximal-distal axis of the a. deserti leaf, and demonstrates broad conservation of leaf development and function across monocotyledonous plants. these reference transcriptomes provide resources for further molecular investigations of the agave genus to enable their use as models for plant adaptations to abiotic stress, and improve agaves for applied bioenergy technologies.

RESULTS
deep sequencing of agave tissues captures the majority of agave transcripts
both a. tequilana and a. deserti spend the majority of their 5–10 year lifespan as vegetative rosettes  before a single flowering event followed by rapid senescence  <cit> . mrna was harvested from various agave tissues , and strand-specific cdna sequencing libraries of specific insert sizes were prepared for illumina sequencing . in total, we sequenced  <dig> million a. tequilana and  <dig> million a. deserti rna fragments using  <dig> nucleotide paired-end reads . to assess coverage of the agave transcriptomes, we plotted the frequency of observing a new unique 25-mer sequence over an increasing number of randomly sampled reads. in both data sets, the 25-mer discovery frequency decreases as sequencing depth increases, and asymptotically levels off at approximately  <dig>   . while complimentary datasets, such as completed genomes, will be required to conclusively determine transcriptome coverage, these observations suggest the sequencing depth was sufficient to sample the majority of sequence diversity in agave tissues. reads from the two agave datasets were separately assembled into contigs by the de novo transcriptome assembly pipeline rnnotator  <cit> . resulting contigs were grouped by sequence similarity into genetic loci to account for alternative splicing and reduce redundancy in downstream analyses .

to eliminate contigs derived from commensal organisms, lab contaminants, and artifacts resulting from incorrect assembly  <cit> , contigs of non-plant origin were removed . analysis of gc content of contigs from the two agave species and contaminating contigs indicates filtering produces high confidence agave transcriptomes largely free of contamination . resulting agave transcriptome details are summarized in table  <dig> . assembled contigs are of similar length in both species . both agaves encode nearly identical numbers of high-confidence proteins . transcripts from non-coding loci tend to be less abundant than transcripts from protein-coding loci  .

additional details on the depth of illumina sequencing are in additional file 1: tables s2–s <dig> 

*sequence data from unusable reads where the illumina truseq index could not be deciphered are not included.

sequence comparisons indicate high accuracy and depth of the a. tequilana de novo assembly
to examine the accuracy of transcript assembly, we complemented our deep short-read sequencing with smaller-scale long-read single-molecule  sequencing of a. tequilana cdnas  <cit>   . error-corrected, high quality subreads   were aligned to the rnnotator de novo assembly . we observed that  <dig>  of  <dig>  subreads are represented in the short-read based de novo agave transcriptome assembly. we also compared the a. tequilana rnnotator assembly to all  <dig> a. tequilana nucleotide sequences available from genbank and observed that  <dig>  are represented in our dataset . comparison of our a. tequilana rnnotator assembly to a set of  <dig>  transcripts assembled from low-depth rna sequencing by mckain et al. <cit>    reveals  <dig>  of the  <dig>  mckain et al. transcripts  are represented in our transcriptome assembly and  <dig>  transcript contigs  align with no insertions or deletions. of transcript contigs aligning between the two de novo assemblies,  <dig>   are longer in the rnnotator de novo assembly. taken together, these comparisons further support the accuracy and near-completeness of our reference transcriptome dataset.

agave deserti and a. tequilana transcriptomes show high sequence identity
the transcriptomes of a. deserti and a. tequilana were compared using reciprocal blat analyses  <cit>  using a minimum sequence identity threshold of 90% . a significant portion of each agave transcriptome aligns to its counterpart, with  <dig> % of a. deserti transcripts aligning to a. tequilana, and  <dig> % of a. tequilana transcripts aligning to a. deserti. transcripts aligning between the two agave species also show a significant similarity in length and long regions of sequence alignment .

clustering of agave protein families further support de novo transcriptome completeness
we identified a core set of  <dig>  reciprocal best hit  protein pairs between the a. deserti and a. tequilana using blastp . the lengths of these rbh proteins correlate strongly  and local alignments demonstrate a median amino acid sequence identity of  <dig> %. this high correspondence between independently assembled datasets further supports assembly accuracy and suggests that a major proportion of the a. deserti and a. tequilana proteomes are shared between the two species. to further investigate proteomic similarity between agaves, we clustered the agave proteomes into protein families using orthomcl  <cit> . most  of the orthomcl-defined protein families in a. deserti and a. tequilana are common to both species .

to further substantiate the de novo agave transcriptomes and perform comparative analyses, agave proteomes were also clustered by orthomcl with the proteomes of  <dig> additional plant kingdom species obtained from phytozome  <cit>  . the pts includes both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and plants exhibiting c <dig> or c <dig> photosynthesis, but no other cam plants as no high-quality datasets are currently available in phytozome. between a. deserti, a. tequilana, and the  <dig> species within the pts, we obtained  <dig>  unique plant protein orthologous groups  from a total of  <dig>  proteins  <cit> .

using orthomcl data, we first compared protein lengths between the inferred proteomes of the pts and our de novo agave assemblies to address transcript contig completeness. there are  <dig>  plant ogs shared between either a. deserti or a. tequilana and at least one member of the pts. these  <dig>  plant ogs encompass  <dig>  agave proteins and  <dig>  proteins from the  <dig> species in the pts . the median lengths of agave and pts proteins within each of the  <dig>  plant ogs correlate highly  and overall demonstrate 1: <dig> correspondence in protein lengths  . the median length of agave proteins within the set is ~11% shorter than that of the pts  .

to estimate agave proteome completeness, we compared the inferred a. tequilana and a. deserti proteomes to those of  <dig> monocotyledonous grass species in the pts: brachypodium distachyon, oryza sativa, sorghum bicolor, and zea mays. an edwards-venn diagram of plant ogs  demonstrates that  <dig> of  <dig>   of protein families common to the  <dig> grass species are shared with agaves despite approximately  <dig> million years of evolution separating these grasses  and agaves   <cit> .

the  <dig> plant ogs common to both agaves but absent in four grass species  represent either agave protein families not present in grasses or protein families with enough sequence diversity to escape orthology detection by orthomcl. gene ontology  enrichment indicates regulatory diversity separates agaves from other monocots . abundant transcription factor families within this set include myb , ethylene response factor-domain , c3hc <dig> zinc finger , and wrky . this agave-specific set also includes hsp20-type heat shock proteins , suggestive of sequence divergence in these agave proteins regulating responses to heat.

agave protein families are of comparable size to those in other plant species
agaves may have adapted to hot, arid environments through expansion of protein families involved in abiotic stress resistance. a comparison of  <dig>  orthomcl-defined protein families common to any member of the pts species and either agave species failed to discover significantly smaller or larger orthologous protein families in agaves . furthermore, no significant expansion of obvious candidate protein families, such as heat shock proteins   <cit> , heat-shock transcription factors   <cit> , and dehydrins  <cit>  was observed. thus, using our clustering methodologies, we found no significant expansion of gene families within agave species suggestive of adaptation to xeric environments. however, the lack of significantly underrepresented plantogs supports the completeness of our de novo transcriptome assemblies.

identifying polymorphisms in a. deserti and a. tequilana
both wild-growing a. deserti and traditionally cultivated a. tequilana are expected to harbor significant amounts of heterozygosity. furthermore, though both a. tequilana and a. deserti are cytological diploids  <cit> , recent work indicates agaves are paleopolyploids resulting from two distinct tetraploidization events  <cit> , potentially leading to the presence of highly similar paralagous loci in their genomes. while these issues can potentially complicate the de novo assembly of transcriptomes due to the consolidation of transcripts originating from distinct alleles or paralagous loci into single transcript contigs, these expected polymorphisms provide opportunities to demonstrate the utility of de novo transcriptomes to develop strategies for marker assisted breeding. we attempted to identify loci displaying evidence of combined assembly of polymorphic alleles and/or paralagous genes by mapping reads back to the reference consensus assembly and identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms  or insertions/deletions .

analysis identified  <dig>   a. deserti loci and  <dig>   a. tequilana loci as having  <dig> or more high-confidence polymorphism when compared to the reference illumina de novo assembly . the median number of polymorphisms  per kilobase  is significantly different between the two species, with  <dig>  ppk in a. deserti and  <dig>  ppk in a. tequilana . of loci exhibiting polymorphisms,  <dig>   a. deserti and  <dig>  a. tequilana loci are protein-coding. in a. deserti, non-coding loci exhibit a higher median ppk than coding loci  , however this was not observed in a. tequilana  . full datasets are available online  <cit> .

mining agave proteins for adaptations to xeric environments
in ex vivo experiments, agave leaf cells can survive temperatures up to  <dig> °c  <cit> , suggesting molecular and cellular adaptations contribute to heat tolerance in a manner independent of agave physiological and morphological adaptations. though computational prediction of protein thermostability from primary structure alone is not completely accurate  <cit> , we tested for protein adaptations to thermal stress using a streamlined version of thermorank  <cit>  . however, we found no signatures of global, proteome-wide thermotolerance adaptation in agaves . independent tests of agave proteins within orthomcl-defined plantogs failed to find agave proteins with significantly higher thermostability than others within phytozome tester set .

agave transposable elements are transcriptionally active
most plant transposable elements  are transcriptionally silent  <cit> , they constitute a significant proportion of agave genomes  <cit>  and contribute to the creation of genetic diversity in many plants  <cit>  including agave <cit> . we identified te-like sequences in agaves  , the majority of which are derived from retrotransposons . very few te annotations encompass entire contigs , with only  <dig> contigs in a. tequilana and  <dig> in a. deserti entirely covered by a te annotation . nearly half of all te annotations  encompass only the 5′ or 3′ end of transcript contigs , suggesting that transcription initiation or termination can occur within tes.

transcriptome profiles of agave tissues are distinguished by physiological function
to examine tissue-specific differences in transcriptome profiles, we analyzed the data sets used for de novo transcriptome assembly based on their tissue of origin . as expected, transcriptome profiles differ between agave tissues in proportion to their respective physiological functions . for example, very small transcriptome differences are observed between adjacent sections of the a. deserti leaf , while the largest differences are observed between roots and leaves in a. tequilana   and between the distal tip of a. deserti leaves and roots  .

in a. deserti, we observed consistent higher expression of  <dig>  transcripts in samples derived from folded leaves and meristematic tissues  . go-terms enriched within these transcripts include functions related to dna synthesis, lipid and membrane synthesis, and targeting of proteins to cellular membranes , all activities typically enriched in actively growing cells within developing leaves and meristems. two enriched go terms  and rna-dependent dna replication ) relate to te biological functions, and  <dig> of the  <dig>  transcripts  are te-like sequences. further analysis confirms te-like sequences generally exhibit highest levels of expression in a. deserti folded leaf and meristem tissues , consistent with developmental relaxation of transposable element silencing , observed in meristematic tissues of other monocotyledonous plants  <cit> .

transcriptomic insights into the a. deserti proximal-distal leaf axis
monocotyledonous leaves develop along a proximal-distal  gradient, maturing from the distal end  to the proximal end   <cit> , and therefore offer an opportunity to assess developmentally regulated gene expression  <cit> . as leaves are involved in bioenergy-relevant traits  and directly face environmental stresses, we sought to gain general insights into the biology of a. deserti leaves . a. deserti loci were divided into  <dig> major clusters based on expression patterns across four pd sections of the leaf  . go enrichment analyses identifies biological functions enriched in each cluster . clusters a and b, including genes with highest expression at the leaf base, include many loci encoding regulatory proteins, as well as proteins involved in cell wall biogenesis, cellulose synthesis, and carbohydrate synthesis. clusters e and f, containing genes expressed highest in distal portions of the leaf, include go terms related to photosynthesis, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and additional regulatory proteins. taken together, clustering data support the notion that growth and organizational processes occur in basal portions of the leaf while many important energy-related metabolic processes occur at the distal end. general patterns of gene expression for select biological functions were visualized along the leaf pd axis . genes involved in photosynthesis are universally expressed higher in the distal portion of the leaf , including genes involved in the diurnal shuttling of co <dig> in cam plants . this suggests that medial-distal portions of a. deserti juvenile leaves are the major site of photosynthesis. on the other hand, the basal portion of the leaf is the site of many developmental processes, including cell wall, lignin, and cellulose biosynthesis, stomata development and patterning, and epicuticular wax and suberin biosynthesis .

we also examined expression of several classes of developmentally-important plant transcription factors and hormones . most transcription factor families are expressed highest at the leaf base. notable exceptions to this pattern are the class ii knox genes, which tend to have broad patterns of expression  <cit> , and mads-box transcription factors, which regulate diverse developmental processes  <cit> . hormone synthesis genes are also expressed in gradients along the leaf pd axis  consistent with their roles in leaves  <cit> . we observed general pd patterns for auxin, abscisic acid , brassinosteroids , cytokinin , gibberellin , and ethylene  hormone biosynthesis . taken together, the general patterns observed along the pd axis of the a. deserti leaf mirror those seen in the monocotyledonous grass zea mays <cit> , with transcription factors regulating developmental processes expressed mostly at the leaf base, and functions of the mature leaf, such as photosynthesis, occur more toward the distal end.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptomes of two agaves adapted to semi-arid  and xeric  environments offer new resources in which to study cam photosynthesis and other physiological adaptations to prolonged drought and heat. comparisons of the agave de novo transcriptome assemblies to other agave sequences and cross-species proteomic comparisons suggest the de novo assemblies are largely complete and accurate. however, the transcriptomes alone provide limited insight into how agaves survive in their environments. for example, though we have identified known genes central to cam biochemistry in agave , a full understanding of cam biology in agave requires studying the regulation of photosynthetic genes in response to physiological and environmental conditions  <cit> . this highlights the need to further functional understanding of agave transcriptomes through experimentation. our reference transcriptomes enable molecular investigations of agaves under environmentally controlled conditions to further elaborate the coordinated gene expression underlying cam, drought resistance, and heat tolerance. as agaves are distinguished from other monocotyledonous plants by regulatory diversity , agave responses to stress may differ from other plants in novel ways.

a simple hypothesis is that agaves adapted to their environments by the expansion of gene families, and the agave transcriptomes allow preliminary analyses of gene duplication. however, our analysis of inferred agave proteomes and those of  <dig> other plant species in the pts found no solid evidence of gene family expansion in agaves. we cannot, however, rule out the possibility of undetected gene family expansion for two reasons. firstly, orthomcl, our clustering algorithm of choice, is relatively strict compared to alternative clustering algorithms  <cit> , potentially leading to false negative results. secondly, as agaves are paleopolyploids  <cit>  and gene duplication events cannot be resolved cleanly without a reference genome, expansion of gene families with highly similar sequences will go undetected. more detailed studies of the extent and nature of agave gene duplications will need to be addressed with a completed genome sequence.

analyses of the inferred agave proteomes by thermorank also failed to find solid evidence of large-scale protein adaptations to thermal stress. in fact, agave proteomes appear to be no more or less thermostable than those of other land plants . interestingly, the proteome of the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii showed the lowest overall thermostability of the  <dig> species within phytozome tester set —an expected result given its aquatic habitat—suggesting thermorank can detect broad differences in protein thermostability. however, to detect more subtle differences between land plant proteomes, more robust methods using protein structure and molecular dynamic simulations  <cit>  may be needed to resolve more subtle protein adaptations to thermal stress.

the de novo transcriptome assemblies are useful to develop molecular markers for further efforts in agave breeding or molecular studies, and we used our data to generate tables of polymorphic sites in the standardized vcf format  <cit> . given the species of agave studied here are primarily outcrossing  <cit>  and more often reproduce clonally  <cit> , we expected to find a large number of polymorphisms within the transcriptome. consistent with this hypothesis, large percentages of both the a. deserti and a. tequilana loci display snps and indels. we also observed a significantly higher frequency of polymorphisms in a. tequilana than a. deserti, consistent with the source of the materials, as the a. deserti sequence data was generated from two sibling plants, while a. tequilana sequence data was generated from a population of individuals . the true number of heterozygous loci may be much higher as alleles not exhibiting equal expression may escape detection with our rna-seq analyses.

our analysis of gene expression along the proximal-distal axis of the juvenile a. deserti leaf demonstrates core classes of genes and biological processes are similar to those observed in zea mays <cit> , supporting evolutionary conservation of monocotyledonous leaf development models  <cit> . a contrast of a. deserti to zea mays is the expression pattern of mads-box transcription factors. mads-box genes can vary widely in expression and function in agave floral structures and meristems  <cit> , but their role in leaf developmental or metabolic processes remains unknown. the location of auxin biosynthesis occurs at a comparatively more distal portion of the blade in a. deserti than z. mays <cit> . these distinctions between agave and zea mays could be related to morphological differences between the two species: unlike maize leaves, a. deserti leaves are lanceolate-shaped with marginal spines  <cit>  and have distinct parenchyma  and chlorenchyma  tissues characteristic of succulent plants  <cit> . such differences in key developmental transcription factors and hormones are perhaps not unexpected as these may be major determinants of agave morphological adaptations to xeric environments.

our agave transcriptomes exemplify the power of de novo transcriptome assembly from short-read rna-seq data  <cit> , which provides both a high-quality sequence resource and insights through transcriptome profiling. leveraging annotation tools and the scientific work from model plant species facilitated insights into the biology agave. this rapid production of comprehensive sequence resources for additional species of industrial and biotechnological interest is needed to meet challenges of climate change and bioenergy development  <cit> . our de novo agave transcriptome assemblies provide a guide for such future de novo transcriptome assembly projects. additional improvements in sequencing length, accuracy, cost, and throughput will make de novo transcriptome assembly an increasingly attractive option for rapid transcriptome exploration.
