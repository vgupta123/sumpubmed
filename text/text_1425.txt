BACKGROUND
prunus avium l. is an economically important temperate species exploited as timber, fruit or rootstock. in europe, sweet cherry, the cultivated form of p. avium, is grown in large areas. cherries are very appreciated not only for their taste and flavor but because they are the first stone fruits in the markets after the winter. in  <dig>  western europe sweet cherry production represented the 4th one in the world  according to fao data .

prunus avium originated likely in an area between the black and the caspian seas  <cit> . stones dated from neolithic or from bronze age found in central europe  <cit>  suggested that wild cherry has spread until the extremity of its present area of distribution very early and well before its domestication  <cit> . sweet cherry was probably domesticated in the prunus avium area of origin but the hypothesis of several different domestication events from different wild populations cannot be discarded  <cit> . first cultivated in greece  <cit> , sweet cherry was later spread all over europe. its cultivation seems to be very old, its grafting technique was already described by the roman writer varo bc, and pliny  gave information of eight distinct cultivars  <cit> . as a result of centuries of natural and human selection a multitude of cherry landraces were raised in europe. the economic and social status of cherries has changed in european societies between classical and medieval times  <cit> . these fruits played an important social role in the medieval elite diet regime  <cit>  before becoming a more common fruit during the later centuries  <cit> .

although many landraces have been lost, a large diversity still exists in europe . on the contrary, a narrow genetic bottleneck is found in modern cultivars  <cit> . landraces are the heritage of generations of farmers, reflecting not only the plurality of the landscapes but also of old farmer’s production systems. landraces were shaped both by edaphoclimatic and traditional agrarian systems diversity and by plurality of human customs. in the last decade, there has been a rapid evolution in cherry cultivation, which has fostered new interest for this highly appreciated crop. new high-quality varieties with improved taste, fruit size, productivity, and, to a lesser extent, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, have been developed. for a long time, a small number of sweet cherry varieties  dominated the market. however, a much wider range of varieties, spanning the whole range of maturity period, have been recently released. nevertheless, molecular diversity studies conducted with simple sequence repeats  have demonstrated the narrow genetic base that has been used up to date for the breeding of modern cherry varieties . moreover, the main production regions base their production on a very restricted number of varieties .

in europe, cherry producers face nowadays new challenges such as sustainable production of high quality fruits, climate change or invasion of new pathogens . hence, exploring cherry genetic diversity is crucial in order to create new cultivars well adapted to these challenges. ex situ genetic resources collections remain valuable reservoirs of allelic variability for many traits not yet exploited in current breeding programs. cherry collections characterization is therefore a major step to facilitate the increased utilization of cherry genetic resources and encourage the sharing of conservation responsibilities between countries in europe. inra is the leader of the prunus genetic resources french national network and it manages large cherry collections including the french national sweet cherry collection. the preservation, evaluation and management of large ex situ germplasm collections are expensive and time consuming  <cit> . hence, identifying ‘core collections’ that maximize cherry genetic diversity with minimum redundancy represents a suitable solution to reduce costs. in addition, ‘core-collections’ may be useful tools as a first step in genetic association studies  <cit> . criteria based on genetic distances between accessions have been shown to be ideal for evaluation and creation of ‘core collections’  <cit> . knowledge of the genetic structure of heterogeneous germplasm collections is essential when forming core collections  <cit>  and is a prerequisite for deciphering complex traits in genetic resources using association mapping  <cit> . association mapping is based on the nonrandom association of alleles at two or more loci, named linkage disequilibrium . linkage disequilibrium has been estimated in sweet cherry, using relatively few ssrs, showing a medium decay compared with self-compatible peach  <cit> . to our knowledge, no previous study examined the extent of ld in sweet cherry germplasm with a high number of genome-wide distributed markers. in addition, medium-density snp arrays have not previously been evaluated for characterizing genetic diversity, population structure and construction of core collections in sweet cherry.

in the context of association mapping, the identification of subgroups within a population or within germplasm collections is a condition for the unbiased estimation of association parameters  <cit> . in most instances, population’s heterogeneous structure reflects adaptation, domestication, and/or breeding effects. in prunus avium, previous studies have shown a marked genetic bottleneck between wild and cultivated cherries  <cit>  as well as a population structure showing three clusters: wild cherry, landraces, and modern sweet cherry cultivars  <cit> .

here, we investigated  <dig> accessions of the inra’s cherry genetic resources collection with the medium-density rosbreed 6 k snp array  <cit> . the objectives of this study were: i) to evaluate the genetic diversity and to estimate the levels of population structure ii) to detect the patterns of ld on cherry and iii) to identify a ‘core collection’ suitable for association genetic studies.

methods
plant material
the sweet cherry collection studied is maintained by the inra’s prunus genetic resources center at bourran , near bordeaux . a total of  <dig> accessions were studied, 50 % of them are of french origin, and belong for a large part to the french national sweet cherry genetic resources collection. the rest of the accessions are of  <dig> other countries of america, asia and europe, with a total number of accessions per country ranging from one to twenty . the accessions can be divided into landraces  and bred cultivars. bred cultivars  result from selections made quite early  and from modern breeding . this classification was mainly based either on information coming from literature or, for the french national sweet cherry collection, on information gathered in collaboration with the ‘centre national de pomologie’ at alès  . six spanish landraces and one hungarian modern variety, not included in the inra’s prunus genetic resources center, were included in the study and were provided by phd angel fernandez i marti . one accession by cultivar was studied excepted for two cultivars ‘noir d’ecully’, and ‘giorgia’ for which two accessions of each were studied, corresponding to different introduction periods.

dna extraction
leaf material was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c for later use. genomic dna was extracted from the frozen tissue using the dneasy® plant kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. genomic dna was quantified using spectrophotometry nanoview  and fluorimetry quant-it™ picogreen®  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. fifteen μl of dna with a concentration between 50 ng/μl – 75 ng/μl were used for subsequent analyses.

snps genotyping
all accessions were genotyped using the rosbreed cherry 6 k illumina infinium ii® snp array v <dig>  <cit> . genotype differences were recorded in the iscan platform and snp genotypes were determined using genome studio genotyping module  as described in  <cit> . the rosbreed cherry 6 k snp array v <dig> markers used in this work were deposited in ncbi’s dbsnp repository available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/snp  <cit>  and each snp was given a unique accession number that starts with the prefix ‘ss’ . more information associated with these snps is available at the genome database for rosaceae . physical positions of the snps  <cit> were inferred from the peach genome  <cit>  and the macrosynteny of peach-sweet cherry genomes  <cit> . snp positions of the rosbreed cherry 6 k array v <dig>  on the peach genome v <dig>  were redefined using batch blast function available at the gdr’s website  .

illumina’s gencall software algorithms for clustering, calling and scoring genotypes were first used to assure snp quality. snps below  <dig>  10 %-gen-call were removed. initial clustering was done using gentrain <dig>  a genomestudio build-in clustering algorithm  <cit> . following the clustering by gentrain <dig>  all snps were visually examined for appropriateness of clustering, cluster separation, number of clusters, presence of null alleles and paralogs. a snp was considered ‘failed’ if it showed  overlapping clusters or ambiguous clusters which could not be improved by even manual clustering  more than  <dig> clusters suggesting presence of paralogs or  very low call frequency  <cit> . the failed snps were not used for further analysis. snp markers with missing data above 5 % were also discarded for further analysis.

analysis of genetic variation
the hardy weinberg equilibrium  and the minor allele frequency  were calculated for each snp using plink  <cit> . the snps showing severe distortion of the hwe , or maf lower than  <dig> , were discarded from further analysis.

the average number of alleles, the observed heterozygosity , the expected heterozygosity  and the inbreeding coefficient  were calculated on landraces and bred cultivars using adegenet  <dig>  r package  <cit> .

bottleneck detection
we tested for recent population bottlenecks in the three groups of plant material  using bottleneck v <dig> . <dig> program  <cit> . a sign test and a standardized differences tests under a two-phase mutation  model  <cit>  was used to determine whether population clusters had undergone a recent bottleneck.

linkage disequilibrium
because ld can affect both principal coordinate analysis  and structure analysis, the marker set was pruned by excluding snps in strong ld using plink software  <cit> . snps were pruned with a window of  <dig> snps and a step size of  <dig> makers. the r <dig> threshold was  <dig> . pairwise ld measures for multiple snps were calculated using plink  <cit> .

correlations based on genotype allele counts, i.e. not phased genotypic data, were used to estimate the ld using plink  <cit> . the squared correlation based on genotypic allele counts is therefore not identical to the r <dig> as estimated from haplotype frequencies, although it will typically be very similar. because it is faster to calculate, it provides a good way to screen for strong ld  <cit> . total length of each chromosome was chosen as window size and all snp pairs were reported within each chromosome. the relationship between ld decay and genetic distance was summarized by fitting a locally-weighted linear regression  line to r <dig> data  <cit>  using r function ‘loess’  <cit> . r <dig> summarizes both recombinational and mutational history  <cit> .

population structure
pcoa , bayesian-based  and discriminant analysis of principal components  analysis were used to investigate the pattern of population structure.

pcoa is a distance-based model which uses jointly a dissimilarity matrix calculated with a simple-matching index, and a factorial analysis. pcoa was performed using darwin  <dig> . <dig> software   <cit> . this software produces graphical representations on euclidean plans which preserve at best the distances between units  <cit> .

the model-based approach implemented in the software package structure  <cit>  was also applied to infer population structure. structure software options offers to split the graphic user interface from the main algorithm helping to set large numbers of runs on a computing cluster . according to this useful scalability, this study supported more than  <dig>  cpu hours, tests and benchmarking operations included. computer time for this study was provided by the computing facilities mcia  of the universities of bordeaux and pau et des pays de l'adour. twenty runs of structure were done by setting the number of clusters  from  <dig> to  <dig> . each run consisted of a burn-in period of  <dig>  steps followed by  <dig>  monte carlo markov chain  replicates, assuming an admixture model and uncorrelated allele frequencies. no prior information was used to define the clusters. for the choice of the most likely number of clusters , the plateau criterion proposed by pritchard et al.  <cit>  and the ∆k method, described by evanno et al.  <cit>  and implemented in structure harvester  <cit> , were used. in order to assess assignment success, structure was run by enforcing k to its true value. for a given k, we used the run that had the highest likelihood estimate to assign cluster proportions to individuals. accessions with estimated memberships above  <dig>  were assigned to corresponding groups whereas accessions with estimated memberships below  <dig>  were assigned to a mixed group. we ran structure on partitioned datasets in order to investigate lower levels of structure, in relation to the results obtained. for the partitioned datasets, k was allowed to vary from one to four for the ‘bred cultivars’ subgroup and from one to  <dig> for the ‘landraces’ subgroup, in agreement with the number of countries of origin of the accessions in each subgroup. pairwise fst  <cit>  among the subpopulations identified by structure were calculated using adegenet  <dig> .

the assumptions underlying the population genetics model in structure may limit its use in crops. unlike natural populations, crops are subjected to displacements, breeding, clonal propagation, absence of panmictic conditions. thus, we complemented the structure analysis with the dapc. the absence of any assumption about the underlying population genetics model, in particular concerning hardy-weinberg equilibrium or linkage equilibrium, is one of the main assets of dapc analysis  <cit> . dapc was used to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals, as implemented in the r’s package adegenet  <dig>   <cit> . dapc transforms the data using pca, and then performs a discriminant analysis on the principal components  retained using a cross-validation method. this multivariate method is suitable for analyzing large numbers of genome-wide snps, and it provides individuals’ assignment to groups as well as a visual assessment of between-population differentiation.

the number of pcs retained can have a substantial impact on the results of the analysis. indeed, retaining too many components with respect to the number of individuals can lead to over-fitting and instability  <cit> . we used the optimization procedure proposed by the r’s package adegenet to assess the optimal number of pcs to be retained  <cit> . the cross-validation procedure implemented with the function xvaldapc performs stratified cross-validation of dapc using varying numbers of pcs   <cit> . pairwise fst  <cit>  among the dapc clusters were calculated using adegenet  <dig> .

core collection creation
core collections are subsamples of larger genetic resources collections which are created in order to include a minimum number of accessions representing the maximum diversity of the original collection. darwin  <dig> .010’s function ‘maximum length sub tree’ has been used to select a reference set in chickpea  <cit> , cowpea  <cit>  and sorghum  <cit> . darwin version  <dig> . <dig> was used to build the diversity trees  <cit> . dissimilarities were calculated with  <dig>  bootstraps and transformed into euclidean distances. un-weighted neighbor-joining  method was applied to the euclidean distances to build a tree with all genotypes. then, ‘maximum length sub tree function’ was used to draw the core collection. maximum length sub-tree implemented is a stepwise procedure that successively prunes redundant individuals. this procedure allows the choice of the sample size which retains the largest diversity, and is visualized by the tree as built on the initial set of accessions . two accessions are redundant if their distance in the tree, as judged by the edges length, is small. the accessions with the longest edge have more uncommon characters and are therefore genetically most diverse. putative clusters of synonym accessions were identified using ‘removed edge value’ provided by the nj tree. a threshold value of  <dig>  was chosen to identify putative synonyms. sphericity index and the length of pruned edge of the initial tree length were used to choose the final core collection accounting for maximum genetic diversity  <cit> .

RESULTS
snp genotyping and variation
the genotyping of  <dig> landraces and cultivars with the rosbreed cherry 6 k snp array generated genotyping data points . after removal of snps failing to generate clear genotype clustering ,  <dig> snps with high quality genotype calls were obtained. snp markers with missing genotypes above 5 % were deleted. markers showing high distortion for hardy-weinberg equilibrium   or minor allele frequency   lower than 5 % were discarded for further analysis using plink  <cit> . homozygous markers for all the individuals  were deleted in the maf step. a total of  <dig> snp markers were retained after these filtering steps . these  <dig> snps markers were distributed over the eight chromosomes with a median distance between markers of 96 kb and an average of  <dig> snp markers per chromosome. the largest gap  was located in lg <dig> . snp markers were ld pruned before performing pcoa and structure analysis to avoid bias using plink  <cit> .  <dig> snp markers were deleted and a total of  <dig> snps were retained . these  <dig> snps markers were distributed over the eight chromosomes with a median distance between markers of 463 kb and an average of  <dig> snp markers per chromosome. the largest gap  was located in lg <dig> .table  <dig> quality filtering of snps

estimation of genetic diversity
the average number of alleles in both early and modern cultivars combined  was the same than in landraces, whereas the number of alleles was lower in early selections than in modern breeding cultivars . this could be associated to the lower number of early selections , as compared to the modern breeding sample .table  <dig> genetic diversity estimations in landraces and bred  cultivars in sweet cherry

genetic diversity parameters showed higher diversity in landraces compared to bred cultivars. however, no significant differences in observed or expected heterozygosity were found between modern and early selected cultivars. further, inbreeding was lower for landraces compared to bred cultivars , whereas no differences were found between early and modern cultivars .

bottleneck detection
to verify whether the landraces, early and modern bred cultivars have experienced a population reduction in size, we detected excess heterozygosity in a population at mutation-drift equilibrium  under the two-phase mutation  model  <cit>  by using the program bottleneck. landraces, early and modern bred cultivars showed significant  heterozygosity excess under the model as an indication of recent demographic contraction.

linkage disequilibrium
detailed understanding of the linkage disequilibrium in a population of cultivars is crucial when considering the application of association genetics or gwas in a species. in this study, the extent of ld was evaluated in  <dig> p. avium trees using  <dig> non ld-pruned snp markers . the overall ld estimated in our plant material was very low and few values of r2 >  <dig>  were found . on average, intra-chromosomal ld declined below r2 =  <dig>  at around  <dig>  mb .fig.  <dig> linkage disequilibrium decay. scatter plot of ld decay  against the genetic distance for pairs of linked snp across the eight linkage groups . zoom-in scatter plot of ld decay  against the genetic distance . distance  is estimated from peach genome v <dig>   <cit>  and high macrosynteny found between peach and sweet cherry  <cit> 



population structure
the genetic structure of the inra’s sweet cherry genetic resources collection was analyzed using structure, pcoa and dapc. all analyses were performed with the ld-pruned  <dig> snp set.

thanks to the scalability of structure software and mcia multi-core infrastructure, we reduced the computing time from one year to few days. in structure the most likely number of clusters was evaluated considering the ∆k method  <cit>  and the plateau criterion  <cit> . the ∆k criterion gave the highest value for k =  <dig> . this method is known to give rise to the first structural level in the data, here two ancestral populations were identified . the first one  accounts for  <dig> accessions, from which 76 % are landraces, whereas the second population  comprises  <dig> accessions, from which 74 % are bred cultivars resulting from both early selection in the 19th century and modern breeding. in addition, a large number of accessions  showed mixed ancestry . in the admixed cluster, landraces and early selected or modern bred accessions are equally represented. the majority  of the  <dig> italian accessions  of the inra’s collection showed mixed ancestry, among them only ‘adriana’ has a membership value lower than 50 % in the bred cluster. nearly 53 % of the french bred cultivars are admixed, 62 % of them being selections from the inra’s sweet cherry breeding program: ‘ferbolus’, ‘fernier’, ‘fercer’, ‘ferprime’ and ‘folfer’, showing more than 50 % of membership in the bred cluster. results obtained with structure were confirmed by the representation of pcoa analysis based on genetic distance matrix using darwin  <dig> . <dig> software  <cit>  . cherry accessions formed two main clusters corresponding to the two ancestral populations identified with structure. the landraces cluster was more scattered than the breeding cultivar one. the admixed accessions were dispersed between these two clusters along the axis  <dig> . pairwise fst values among structure clusters ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   .fig.  <dig> inferred population structure of the collection using structure software. bar plot of individual ancestry proportions for the genetic clusters inferred using structure  and the reduced dataset . individual ancestry proportions  are sorted within each cluster. admixture model, independent frequencies,  <dig>  burn-in iterations,  <dig>  markov chain monte carlo iterations were used for this analysis. bred cultivars and landraces ancestral populations are shown in green and red, respectively

as the evanno ∆k preferentially detects the uppermost level of structure of the data  <cit> , we analyzed each cluster independently to explore whether a substructure could be detected within each group. the two partitioned datasets comprised  <dig> accessions of the ‘bred cultivars’ ancestral population and  <dig> accessions of the ‘landraces’ ancestral population. the  <dig> accessions considered as admixed were discarded from further analyses. within the two groups, ‘bred cultivars’ and ‘landraces’, structure allowed the identification of two subgroups in each group . ‘bred cultivar’ group was separated in two clusters. the first one is formed by 63 % of the total bred accessions  and it includes most of the american  and french modern varieties hosted in the inra’s sweet cherry genetic resources collection. the second cluster is smaller, 11 % of the total bred accessions , and consists mainly in european accessions, the iranian cultivar ‘noire de meched’ and ‘stark lambert’ from usa. the admixed group contains all the eastern european modern varieties with the exception of ‘badacsony’ accession, which was included in the ‘bred cultivar 2’ group.

concerning the landraces group, the evanno criterion gives a strong signal for k =  <dig> and a weaker for k =  <dig> . when k =  <dig> was considered, landraces were split into two clusters. the first one contained 34 % of the total number of landraces accessions  and it gathered accessions from spain, hungary, great britain and france, including ‘early burlat’. the second one included 12 % of the total number of landraces accessions , which were all of french origin. remaining landraces accessions  were admixed.

the second criterion used to evaluate the most likely number of clusters was the plateau criterion  <cit> . here, the mean log-likelihood curve attained a maximum value around k = 9; beyond this value, it decreased slightly before reaching a plateau, showing an increase of the associated estimates’ standard deviation . to cross-check the results from structure with a model-free method, a third method, dapc, was used. the functions ‘find.clusters’ and ‘k-means’ algorithm were used to determine the number of clusters maximizing the variation between clusters  <cit> . to avoid the loss of information these two functions were performed with  <dig> principal components, accounting for more than 98 % of the variance . the bayesian information criterion  was used to identify the optimal number of clusters,  <dig>  indicated by an elbow curve of bic values as a function of k . the number of retained pc for dapc analyses was calculated using a cross validation method implemented in ‘xvaldapc’ function from r adegenet  <dig>  package  <cit> . ‘xvaldapc’ function minimized the mean square error using  <dig> pc . also, a bar plot of eigenvalues for the discriminant analysis was used to select eight discriminant functions to be retained . thus, a scatter plot was drawn using nine clusters obtained by bic,  <dig> pca obtained by xvaldapc, and the two main axes of the discriminant analysis  . pairwise fst values among dapc clusters ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . membership values of each individual to the nine clusters are available in the assign-plot . clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were clearly differentiated using the two main da eigenvalues . cluster  <dig> consisted in accessions mainly released by breeding programs from eastern european countries . it also includes the german variety ‘regina’ and the set of accessions: ‘badacsony’, ‘gégé’, ‘belge’, ‘noire de meched’ and ‘ferrovia’ . cluster  <dig> included only modern varieties. it contains 85 % of canadian accessions of the inra’s collection, among which ‘van’ and some of its descendants , 47 % of the american ones in particular ‘hardy giant’ and ‘garnet’, and 61 % of the french ones, with ‘fercer’ and all its derived hybrids , except ‘folfer’ and ‘ferlizac’ which are included in dapc clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. most of the accessions comprised in cluster  <dig> are landraces with a short flowering-maturity period.fig.  <dig> discriminant analysis of principal component  scatter plot of individuals using the  <dig> snp set.  <dig> pcs  and eight discriminant functions   were retained during analyses, to describe the relationship between the clusters. the scatterplot shows only the first two pcs of the dapc analysis. the bottom right graph illustrates the variation explained by the  <dig> pcs



clustering performed by dapc is consistent with the available information on pedigree data . for example, ‘burlat’ and its descendants clustered together in group  <dig>  also, dapc clustering was represented according to the countries of origin . the plant material analyzed in this study from countries such as canada, italy, spain or usa, showed a narrow genetic diversity, with most of each country’s cultivars included in only one or two clusters. also, the results confirmed the large diversity of the french germplasm included in all the clusters.

we compared the  <dig> subgroups obtained from structure and dapc: both approaches provided similar results . when admixed individuals were all considered as an admixed group  in the dapc analysis, the clusters calculated by structure and dapc analysis were the same, except for structure groups one and six, which were included in dapc group  <dig> .

one interesting feature of dapc method is that it allows calculating the contributions of alleles to the regions of the genome driving genetic divergence among groups  <cit> . however, no significant allele contribution  was found for the main two dimensions on our analysis .

dapc was also performed by using  <dig> snps as no assumption on ld equilibrium is required for dapc analysis  <cit> . the same number of clusters  was obtained. most of the individuals clustered in the same clusters as in the 326-snp dapc analysis. however, individuals showing a low membership value  were clustered to different groups compared with the 326-snp dapc analysis . clustering performed slightly better with the  <dig> than with the  <dig> snp set, obtaining higher membership scores for the defined clusters.

core collection
the aim of developing genetic core collections is to select a reduced set of accessions representing the genetic diversity among individuals in a large source of germplasm. a first core reference set, suitable for association genetic studies, was selected to capture the genetic diversity of sweet cherry available in the inra’s sweet cherry collection.

neighbor-joining  tree based on the dissimilarity matrix between  <dig> accessions of the inra’s sweet cherry collection was initially built to assess the genetic distribution of markers. groups of nj tree were, in general, in agreement with structure   and dapc analysis  , although some individuals were assigned to different clusters depending on the approach.fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining trees compared with structure results . trees from snp data of the inra’s sweet cherry collection  and the constructed core collection . colors indicate the clusters calculated using structure: landraces , bred cultivars  and admixed

darwin  <dig> . <dig> function maximum length sub tree method was iteratively used to eliminate the most redundant accessions until the percentage of sphericity index and pruned edge came to a flat line, corresponding to  <dig> accessions .

putative clusters of synonym accessions were identified using removed edge value of nj tree. a total of  <dig> accessions were grouped in  <dig> groups of synonymy . putative synonym groups included from two to six individuals. for example, ‘michaude’, ‘bigarreau hâtif burlat’, ‘beaulieu’, ‘lazar’, ‘bigarreau semi-hâtif’ and ‘ogier’ were identified as putative synonyms. moreover, two accessions corresponding to different introduction periods of both ‘noir d’ecully’ and ‘giorgia’ cultivars, were proved to be identical using the rosbreed cherry 6 k snp array v <dig> 

discussion
snp genotyping and variation
this study provides the first overview of the genetic variation in a large collection of sweet cherry germplasm using a medium-density array of snp genome-wide distributed markers. we provide the first study confirming the utility of the rosbreed array v <dig>   <cit>  for genotyping a collection of genetic resources of p. avium. despite the use of a relatively low number of detection panel accessions, each sequenced at low depth, for the development of the rosbreed array v <dig>   <cit> , we obtained more than  <dig> high-quality snps after filtering. this array of snp markers allowed to increase the marker density compared with previous diversity analyses performed with ssr or snp markers in sweet cherry  <cit> .

estimation of genetic diversity
observed and expected heterozygosities calculated in this study were lower than those calculated using ssrs in cultivated sweet cherry  <cit> . this can be related to the lower information provided by snps compared to ssrs for variability studies, as shown in peach  <cit> . also, ho and he were slightly lower in our data than in a panel of  <dig> sweet cherry accessions using  <dig> snp markers   <cit> . the excess of heterozygosity  can be linked to the gametophytic self-incompatibility  system controlling sexual reproduction in sweet cherry  <cit> .

significant differences for ho, he and inbreeding coefficient  between landraces and selected cultivars are in agreement with the loss of diversity associated to breeding. a higher impact of breeding compared to domestication was shown for sweet cherry  <cit> . however, in our study no significant differences between modern and early selections were observed. this could be due to the low number of individuals available in these groups, especially in the ‘early selections’ group.

bottleneck detection
the excess of heterozygosity found for sweet cherry can also be related to a genetic bottleneck, as found by the bottleneck software. these results are in agreement with previous bottleneck events suggested in sweet cherry  <cit> . when a population experiences a reduction of its effective size, it generally develops a heterozygosity excess at selectively neutral loci  <cit> .

linkage disequilibrium
when ld declines rapidly with distance, ld mapping is potentially very precise  <cit> . ld decays more rapidly in cross-pollinated species as compared to self-pollinated species because recombination is less effective in the latter. ld can also be related to reduction in population size accompanied by extreme genetic drift  <cit> . selection produces bottlenecks at a specific locus and those linked. in addition, selection for epistatic loci might result in ld of loci not physically linked  <cit> .

ld decays rapidly in a gene by recombination after selection for a particular allele  <cit> , the time scale of domestication  may be such that an appreciable selective effect on ld remains  <cit> . this remained ld could be more important in sweet cherry considering the lower number of recombination events, due to its long cycle and its vegetative propagation through grafting.

the high proportion of snp loci pairs in ld as well as the decay of ld with distance shows that association mapping is a potential tool applicable to sweet cherry breeding. these results are in agreement with the rapid ld decay previously showed in cultivated sweet cherry using  <dig> ssr  <cit> . however, a low proportion of linked snp pairs with r <dig> values >  <dig>  was found . such high r <dig> values are required to detect snp-phenotype associations explaining low values of phenotypic variance  <cit> . thus, a genome-wide association mapping aiming at explaining low percentages of phenotypic variance would need a higher number of markers compared to the snps available in the rosbreed cherry 6 k snp array v <dig> 

our results show a lower linkage disequilibrium compared to the model species in prunus, prunus persica l.,  <cit> . this can be related to the self-incompatibility system described in sweet cherry  <cit> .

population structure
the different approaches  used to analyze the structure of the inra’s sweet cherry collection appeared to provide complementary information. structure performed well in detecting global clusters of diversity and results were confirmed by pcoa. nevertheless, the two parameters used to choose the most likely number of clusters in structure did not give the same value for k. evanno Δk method gave k =  <dig> in the whole analysis as well as in the investigation of cryptic structure. the evanno method finds the uppermost level of structure in the data, as it focuses exclusively on the change in slope. according to some authors this may cause Δk to be artificially maximal at k =  <dig> in some cases  <cit> . nevertheless similar results were obtained on a previous sweet cherry structure study based on ssr  <cit> , and k =  <dig> is often reported when analyzing germplasm collections . our results are in agreement with a previous structuration of sweet cherry cultivars into landraces and modern varieties  <cit> . we completed the analysis using the maximum likelihood parameter as recommended by pritchard et al.  <cit> , in that case k was set to nine. this value of k appeared to fit with the origin and the pedigree of the accessions.

the dapc method provides an interesting alternative to structure software as it does not require that populations are in hw equilibrium and can handle large sets of data without using parallel processing software. however, as for other multivariate analyses, the reduction of genetic information to interindividual or interpopulation distances may represent a substantial loss of information  <cit> . nevertheless, our results showed a good consistency between structure and dapc analyses when no admixed individuals were considered. also dapc analysis provided a more detailed clustering within landraces and bred cultivars compared structure analysis either in our study or in previous analysis using ssr  <cit> .

regarding membership to clusters, dapc provides membership values that are different from admixture coefficients from structure, but they can still be interpreted as proximities of individuals to the different clusters  <cit> . however, group membership provided by r’s adegenet package is more useful for groups defined by external criteria  rather than by k-means, as k-means provides optimal groups for dapc and therefore both classifications will be mostly consistent  <cit> .

clustering of individuals presented in this study may give interesting cues for increasing diversity in breeding programs and germplasm collections. for example, landraces were included in all clusters except for cluster four whereas most of modern cultivars were included in only three clusters . this is especially clear for the inra’s cultivars released in the last two decades, as most of them  are included in cluster four. hence, the use of landraces different from the clusters four, five or six, as founding clones, would increase the genetic diversity of new cultivars. also, most north american cultivars  are included in two close clusters . this is in agreement with the repeated use of five founding clones and one genetic source for self-compatibility in sweet cherry breeding in north america  <cit>  and with the lowest fst value found in our study among clusters four and six . this repeated use of a few founding clones and their progeny as parents in breeding programs may eventually result in loss of genetic variability and a concomitant increase in inbreeding depression in future generations  <cit> . the inbreeding problem and potential genetic limitations have been raised for numerous fruit species modern breeding programs, including sweet cherry . a deep knowledge of the structure of the germplasm and the identification of clusters could assist the choice of genitors in current breeding programs, which may maximize genetic diversity and enhance the potential gain from selection. this would help to increase the breeding programs’ efficiency to face new demands from consumers  and industry , as well as new ecological issues .

core collection
characterization and maintenance of germplasm collections is a laborious task. genetic and phenotypic knowledge is crucial for a better understanding and utilization of the available genetic resources by breeders  <cit> . in this study, we propose the first core collection from the inra’s sweet cherry collection, accounting for landraces and cultivars from  <dig> different countries.

some putative synonymous cultivars were probably renamed when released in the same region but at different periods of time. for example, ‘bigarreau jaboulay’ and ‘guigne ramon oliva’ were released in southeastern france in  <dig> in  <dig>  respectively. other possibilities could be that those cultivars were released in different regions or countries, or even commercialized with different names. thus, ‘lazar’, described as “a seedling of unknown parentage probably a selection from ‘burlat’”  was identified in this study as a putative synonym of ‘burlat’.

in other context, the cluster of putative synonyms identified in this study: ‘badacsony’, ‘belge’ ‘ferrovia’, ‘gégé’, ‘noire de meched’, and ‘stark lambert’; is in accordance with previous fingerprinting analysis using aflp and ssr markers  <cit> . however, this clustering is contradictory to the country of origin and the period of release of these cultivars. a comparative study using accessions of these cultivars conserved both in the region of origin  and in different institutes is suggested. this recommended study would be essential to elucidate this possible incoherence. in addition, putative synonyms should be verified with a higher density snp assay or ngs technologies to avoid misassignment. for example, punctual mutation may have not been picked up by the rosbreed sweet cherry array but severely affect the phenotype of an individual. this is the case of two putative synonyms identified; ‘fougerouse’ and ‘fougerouse blanc’ accessions; which show red and yellow fruit color, respectively. ‘fougerouse’ and ‘fougerouse blanc’ represent an excellent material for functional genomics studies aimed at deciphering the fruit color in sweet cherry.

the diversity of inra’s sweet cherry core collection could be maximized by introducing exotic plant material underrepresented so far, such as landraces and wild cherries. for example, the spanish landraces ‘punxeta’ and ‘tarrega’ are two good candidates to be included in the inra’s sweet cherry collection. in addition

inra’s sweet cherry core collection represent a valuable tool for the development of genome-scale analysis aimed at deciphering the genetic determinism of traits for this species.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we show the first population-genetics analysis in cultivated sweet cherry using a medium-density snp marker array. we provide estimations of linkage disequilibrium, genetic structure using different approaches and the definition of a first inra’s sweet cherry core collection. this information will be useful for parent selection in breeding programs, germplasm management and association genetics studies. thanks to the perennial nature of sweet cherry and the ease of vegetative propagation, this core collection could be easily disseminated worldwide for further analyses.
