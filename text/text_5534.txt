BACKGROUND
durum wheat  and common wheat  are largely cultivated in european countries and the grain used for the human alimentation  and animal feeds. common wheat allows producing wheat flour and bread, while durum wheat is primarily processed into semolina to produce pasta and couscous and some specialty breads. fusarium graminearum, one of the major global pathogens of cereals, is considered the main causal agent of fusarium head blight  disease in wheat  <cit> . f. graminearum infection causes a significant grain yield and quality loss by producing trichothecene mycotoxins that make harvest unsuitable for human and animal consumption  <cit> . host resistance is the primary trait used as a control measure, and its manipulation is the best economic and ecological strategy to reduce damage caused by fhb disease. however, the molecular bases of wheat resistance and susceptibility to f.graminerum are scarcely known  <cit> . resistance to fhb is a complex and quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes and characterized by large genetic variation in wheat gene pool  <cit> . several studies aimed to identify traits involved in fhb resistance were carried out using common wheat  while limited information is available for durum wheat , which is currently one of the cereals most susceptible to f.graminearum infection  <cit> . even though in the last decade different studies were focused on the identification of candidate genes involved in f.graminerum resistance in cultivated or wild durum germoplasm, to date the sources of fhb resistance in durum wheat have not been fully identified  <cit> .

f. graminearum preferentially infects wheat spikelets at the stage of anthesis, performs inter and intra-cellular growth and spreads systemically along the rachis  <cit> . during infection, f. graminearum produces cell wall degrading enzymes , such as pectinases, xylanases and cellulases, to degrade cell wall polysaccharides to penetrate and colonize the host tissues  <cit> . the role of cell wall components in plant resistance to disease has been scarcely studied in grasses. new lines of evidence indicate that content and composition of cell wall polymers affect the susceptibility of cell wall  to cwdes and can play a role in the outcome of host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . notably, the extent of cw degradation is often associated with severity of disease  <cit>  cell wall polysaccharides of the graminaceous monocots , consist of a network of cellulose fibers embedded in a matrix of hemicelluloses, such as arabinoxylan  and mixed linkage glucans , with a minor amount of xyloglucan and pectins  <cit> . ax  is composed of a β <dig> -linked xylose backbone substituted by different monosaccharides, such as arabinose, glucuronic acid and, to lesser extent, galactose  <cit> . the degree of arabinose substitutions are thought to affect the ax degradability by fungal xylanases  <cit> . mlgs  is an unbranched polysaccharide consisting of blocks of -β-linked d-glucose residues interrupted by single -β-linkages  <cit> . pectins  are complex polymers with different structural domains including homogalacturonan , rhamnogalacturonan i , rhamnogalacturonan ii  and xylogalacturonan . galacturonosyl residues of pectin backbones are methylesterified in golgi apparatus and secreted into the cell wall in a highly methylesterified form. in the apoplasm, pectins are de-methylesterified by pectin methyl esterases , which modulate the degree and patterns of methylesterification  <cit> . the de-methylesterification of pectin affects its interaction with cellulose  <cit>  and the formation of crosslinks between pectin chains and xyloglucan or lignin  <cit> . the methylesterification makes pectin less susceptible to degradation by pectin degrading enzymes produced by fungal pathogens  <cit> . pectin content and methylesterification in grasses has been associated with plant resistance to pathogens  <cit> . lignin is a complex aromatic heteropolymer comprising a substantial portion  of the grasses cell wall. lignin of monocotyledonous species includes three types of monomers such as p-hydroxyphenyl , guaiacyl , and syringyl  phenylpropanoid monolignols  <cit> . lignin is an important structural component involved in defense against invasive pathogens, making the cell wall more resistant to cwdes and also preventing the diffusion of the pathogen-produced toxins  <cit> .

the objective of our research is to identify cell wall biochemical traits useful to improve fhb resistance in durum wheat. to that end, detailed comparative analyses of cell wall composition in spikes isolated from a highly resistant common wheat accession “02-5b-318”, a breeding line derived from the fhb-resistant chinese cv. sumai- <dig> and a highly susceptible durum wheat cv. saragolla were performed. significant differences in lignin composition, ax substitution and pectin methylesterification were found between resistant and susceptible plants. the genomic sequence and the chromosome location of wheatpme <dig> gene, differently expressed in resistant and susceptible lines during f. graminearum infection and possibly involved in susceptibility to fusarium graminearum, was identified and characterized.

RESULTS
assessment of fusarium symptoms on wheat spikes
in the present study, the resistance to fhb was analyzed in common wheat accession line 02-5b- <dig> and in saragolla, known as one of the most susceptible durum wheat cultivar  <cit> . spikes at anthesis were inoculated with fungal spores and disease symptoms were recorded  <dig>   <dig> and 20 days post-infection. symptoms were evaluated as fhb incidence, expressed as percentage of infected spikes per genotype and fhb severity, expressed as percentage of spikelets showing symptoms on the total number of spikelets per spike  <cit> . significantly higher fhb incidence and severity were observed in saragolla  in comparison with line 02-5b- <dig>   indicating that the two genotypes exhibited quite extreme phenotypes for fhb resistance/tolerance.figure  <dig>

the cell wall of 02-5b-318r spikes contain higher content of s lignin with respect to saragollas
a detailed analysis of the main structural cell wall components was performed in spikes of 02-5b-318r and saragollas plants, at anthesis. the characterization of lignin content and composition demonstrated that, while the two genotypes did not differ in the content of lignin, they showed significant differences in monolignols . in particular, lignin of 02-5b-318r spikes contained a significant higher percentage of syringyl  and p-hydroxyphenyl  monolignols and a lower amount of guaiacyl  monolignols, hence having a higher s/g ratio in comparison with saragollas genotype. recent studies aimed to elucidate the effects of lignin composition on the resistance of cell wall to degradation by decay fungi demonstrated that poplar lines extremely rich in syringyl lignin were recalcitrant to fungal degradation  <cit> . the transcript level of the cinnamoyl-coa reductase csccr <dig> in the oilseed crop camelina sativa was observed to be more than  <dig> times higher in the lines with the higher resistance to sclerotinia sclerotiorum than in susceptible lines, and this correlated with an high level of constitutive s-lignin  <cit> . suppression of f5h  or caomt , which reside on a branch pathway converting g to s monolignols, greatly reduced the s/g ratio  <cit> . in addition, the silencing of caomt in triticum monococcum enhanced powdery mildew penetration  <cit> . also, the synapyl alcohol-specific peroxidases involved in polymerization of monolignols can be regulated during fusarium infection. overall these results suggest that a higher s lignin content is a possible cell wall biochemical trait related to fusarium resistance and also propose that genes favoring s-type lignin accumulation might potentially be involved in the resistance to the pathogen.table  <dig>

xylans in cell wall of 02-5b-318r spikes present a higher degree of arabinosylation with respect to saragollas
we performed a comparative analysis of cw polysaccharides of 02-5b-318r and saragollas wheat plants. the cell walls were extracted from spikes and the cellulose content as well as monosaccharide composition of the non-cellulosic polysaccharides were determined . the amount of the cellulose-derived glucose was not significantly different between the two genotypes indicating that cellulose content is not related to their different fhb resistance/susceptibility . monosaccharide composition of non-cellulosic polysaccharides was determined by hpaec-pad  after acid hydrolysis of alcohol insoluble solid  . as reported for other wheat tissues  <cit> , monosaccharide composition of spike cell walls showed xylose as the main non-cellulosic constituent comprising 70–75 mol% of the total sugars, followed by arabinose , glucose and galacturonic acid , galactose , and small contents of fucose, rhamnose and glucuronic acid . the comparison of the composition in monosaccharides between 02-5b-318r and saragollas spikes indicated a significantly higher percentage of arabinose, galactose and glucose as well as a lower percentage of xylose in the resistant line as compared to the susceptible one . the arabinose/xylose ratio , was significantly higher in spikes of 02-5b-318r respect to saragollas . to identify the nature of cell wall polysaccharide differing in the two genotypes, ais was sequentially fractionated by using solutions with increasingly harsh extraction conditions. chelating agent soluble solid  fractions, mainly containing pectic polysaccharides, and 1 m koh and 4 m koh fractions, mainly containing hemicelluloses weakly and strongly bound to the cell wall, respectively, were isolated and analyzed for the monosaccharide composition . pectin fractions were not significantly different between the two genotypes. the hemicellulose-enriched fractions from the 02-5b-318r plants contained a significantly higher amount of arabinose, galactose and glucose, a lower amount of xylose and showed a higher ara/xyl ratio in comparison with spikes from saragollas. in grasses, xylose and arabinose mainly constitute arabinoxylans  and the combined levels of arabinose and xylose provide a good estimate of arabinoxylan content  <cit> . the percentage of arabinoxylans, calculated as sum of arabinose and xylose, was significantly lower in spikes of 02-5b-318r respect to saragollas . these results therefore indicate a significantly lower amount of arabinoxylans and higher degree of arbinoxylation in the hemicellulose of the 02-5b-318r plants in comparison with saragollas and that the differences previously observed between the two genotypes  can be mainly attributed to the hemicellulose polymers. monoclonal antibodies can be used to define structural features of polysaccharides in isolated cell wall fractions. in particular lm <dig> monoclonal antibody is specific to xylan domains enriched in arabinose substitutions  <cit> . 1 m koh fractions extracted from spikes of 02-5b-318r and saragollas were analyzed with lm <dig> antibodies using immunodot assay. a higher level of lm11-binding epitopes was detected in 02-5b-318r spikes in comparison with the fhb susceptible wheat genotype  confirming the higher degree of xylan arabinosylation of 2-5b-318r spikes in comparison with saragollas. a negative correlation between the ara/xyl ratio and wheat bran digestibility by fungal xylanases have been previously demonstrated  <cit> . in grasses, arabinose residues of xylans can form ferulic acid-mediated crosslinks between xylan chains and lignin components that limit the enzymatic digestibility of cell walls and improve fusarium resistance  <cit> . the greater arabinosylation of xylans observed in 02-5b-318r spikes could contribute to a lower degradability of these polymers during fusarium infection and could consequently represent a potential cell wall trait contributing to fhb resistance. recently, glycosyltransferases of family  <dig> were found to be arabinosyltransferases  in grasses  <cit> . interestingly, arabinoxylan also influences desease resistance of barley against the powdery mildew fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei indicating that in monocot this hemicellulose is important in response to fungal infection  <cit> . the higher amount of glucose observed in 02-5b-318r in comparison with saragollas  indicate a different amount of -β-d-glucan  in their cell walls. also in this case cslf and cslh glycosyltransferases implicated in mlg biosynthesis have been identified in grasses  <cit>  consistently, a decreased β-d-glucan content was observed in susceptible but not in resistant genotypes after inoculation of wheat spikes with fusarium culmorum  <cit> .figure  <dig>

a different degree and pattern of methylesterification was observed in 02-5b-318r and saragollas spikes
the degree and pattern of pectin methylesterification impact the plant susceptibility to fungal and bacterial pathogens and affect the outcome of disease  <cit> . the degree of methylesterification  of cell wall isolated from spikes of 02-5b-318r was significantly higher  in comparison with saragollas genotype . in accordance with this, durum wheat plants overexpressing the pectin methylesterase inhibitor from kiwi, acpmei, exhibited a costitutive increased degree of methylesterification  and were more resistant to f. graminerum, bipolaris sorokiniana and claviceps purpurea in comparison with untransformed plants  <cit> . it was also demonstrated that highly methylesterified pectins were less susceptible to the action of polygalacturonases  of both b. sorokiniana and f. graminearum and a reduced growth of both fungal pathogens was detected on cell walls isolated from the transgenic plants indicating that the increased resistance of acpmei plants was due to the impaired ability of these fungi to colonize the host tissue  <cit> . pectin domains with a random pattern of methylesterification, recognized by the monoclonal antibody lm <dig>  have been demonstrated to be more sensitive to fungal pgs and pectate lyases   <cit> . immunodot assay performed with lm <dig> antibodies on chass enriched pectin fraction extracted from spikes of 02-5b-318r and saragollas showed a significant lower level of lm7-binding epitopes in the 02-5b-318r plants in comparison with the susceptible genotype . these results indicate that pectin of 02-5b-318r spikes is enriched in domains less susceptible to pgs of f. graminearum secreted at early stages of infection  <cit> . noteworthy, lm <dig> epitopes were also reduced in wheat plants overexpressing acpmei and showing improved resistance to f. graminearum  <cit> .figure  <dig>

recent evidence indicates that pectin de-methylesterification is induced at early stages of pathogen infection and favor the outcome of disease  <cit> . to determine whether pectin methylesterification is altered during fungal infection, dm was monitored at different times in uninfected and infected 02-5b-318r and saragollas spikes. the level of pectin methylesterification was significantly reduced in both genotypes during the early stages of fusarium infection . however, while a significant decrease of dm was observed in saragollas spikes 48 h hour post inoculation , the dm reduction in 02-5b-318r infected spikes was evident only after  <dig> hpi. notably at  <dig> hpi, the reduction of dm in the susceptible saragollas genotype was approximately 60% compared to a 25% reduction in the resistant genotype.figure  <dig>

studies focused on the analysis of modification of cw composition during fungal infection indicate that cw degradation occur in a sequential manner. pectic enzymes, mainly including pgs and pls, are the first to be produced by fungal pathogens during the early stages of infection followed by hemicellulases and cellulases  <cit>  and although wheat contain a low level of pectin, pgs and pls produced by fusarium during infection are important determinants of the outcome of disease  <cit> . the analysis of the cell wall degradation by f.graminearum was performed by monitoring the monosaccharide composition of ais isolated from infected spikes at different hpi . no difference in monosaccharide composition was detected in the cell walls of infected spikes at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi . at  <dig> hpi, the level of fuc, rha, gal, gala and glca monosaccharides was significantly reduced in saragollas cell walls as compared to 02-5b-318r indicating an higher extent of pectin degradation in the susceptible line. these results suggest that the higher dm and reduced content of pectin domains with random pattern methylesterification in 02-5b-318r spikes as well as the reduced demethylesterification observed during infection can contribute to protect cw by fungal cwdes degradation. the hemicellulose alteration was not observed at these stages of infection most likely, because the degradation of hemicelluloses occurs at late stages of infection as reported  <cit> .

isolation and characterization of wheatpme1
the degree and pattern of pectin methylesterification in planta is regulated by pmes. in addition to their important role in plant development  <cit>  more recent evidence indicates that plant pmes are directly involved in plant response against pathogens  <cit> . with the aim to identify wheat pme genes involved in fusarium resistance, we focused our attention on brachypodium distachyon, which is considered, in respect to vast majority of traits , a convenient model system for monocots  <cit> . among different pme sequences, identified using phytozome web site, we focused our attention on bradi1g <dig>  gene . this gene showed the highest sequence similarity with wheat ests corresponding to a pme gene localized on the chromosome 2a, where the major fhb qtls were found. the bdpme <dig> complete genomic sequence consists of 1812 bp corresponding to a mrna of 1728 bp encoding a  <dig> amino acids protein. bdpme <dig> belongs to type i pme containing, in addition to the catalytic pme domain, an n-terminal pro region that share homology with pmeis  <cit> . bdpme <dig> gene is located on chromosome  <dig> of brachypodium genome and composed of two exons: the first at the 5’ end is 498 bp long including the pro region; the second including the pme domain is 1230 bp long. the two exons are separated by a very short intron sequence 84 bp long.

with the aim to isolate the bdpmei <dig> orthologous in wheat, the gene sequence was blasted against public databases. two wheat ests, showing a sequence identity higher than 80% with respect bdpme <dig>  were found: the first one  entirely covered the bdpme <dig> longer exon, while the second one  partially matched to the shorter exon at the 5’end of the gene sequence. the hexaploid wheat cv. chinese spring draft genome and the row  <dig> sequence reads of cv. chinese spring annotated at cereals-db archive  were searched to extend both ests and three larger consensus contigs were obtained assignable to each of the three a, b and d genomes. the three genes were identified using softbarry prediction software  and named wheatpme1-a, wheatpme1-b and wheatpme1-d . they showed a 99% nucleotide sequence identity among each other  and the same intron/exons structure comprising two exons of  <dig> and 555 bp, separated by an intron of 54 bp, corresponding to a mrna sequence of 1608 bp . the translation of the three wheatpme1-a, wheatpme1-b and wheatpme1-d sequences resulted in a same  <dig> amino acid protein, sharing an amino acid identity of 77% with bdpme <dig> . the propt.comp. v. <dig>  software indicates wheatpme <dig> as an “extracellular secreted protein”, conforming with the apoplastic locatization of the enzyme. the genomic sequences of wheatpme <dig> homoeologous genes were obtained in 02-5b-318r  and saragollas  using genomic specific primers. the nucleotide sequences and intron/exons structures were respectively identical to the corresponding homoeologous wheatpme <dig> genes in a, b and d genomes of 02-5b-318r and in a and b genomes of saragollas indicating that the sequence of this gene is strongly conserved in different wheat genotypes. no polymorphism in the wheatpme <dig> gene was detected between 02-5b-318r and saragollas. a blast search for plant sequences related to wheatpme <dig> mrna  revealed a number of genes which predicted amino acid sequences were analyzed using non-redundant protein database. the search for grass sequences related to wheatpme <dig> in phytozome database  revealed a number highly conserved pmes genes, which encode proteins with a slightly variable length ranging from  <dig> aminoacids  to  <dig> aminoacids  and with an identity level ranging from  <dig> to 78% . all the selected pmes belong to type i pme accounting for a smaller pro region at n-terminus of the pme gene, with length range of 151– <dig> aa, and a longer pme domain with length range of 297– <dig> aa; consistently with other evidence, these are highly conserved among the selected species  <cit> . among the selected wheatpme <dig> orthologous the gene structure appeared to be highly conserved , and always composed by one single exon. the exceptions are rice and brachypodium distachyon where the sequences are accounted for two gene copies, one is composed by one and another by two exons. multi-alignment of genomic sequences showed that the different orthologous are characterized by several synthenic regions, particularly one of which showed the same position and orientation in all the selected grasses, likely corresponding to the active site of the enzyme .figure  <dig>

wheatpme <dig> gene chromosomal position and gene expression in 02-5b-318r and saragollas during f.graminearum infection
the chromosome position of the homoeologous wheatpme <dig> genes was obtained using genetic stocks including nulli-tetrasomic, di-telosomic and a set of wheat deletion bin lines. the homeologous genes were physically located on the short arm of chromosome group  <dig> in 2bs1- <dig> - <dig>  and c-2as5- <dig>  bins, respectively. this chromosome position supports a role of wheatpme <dig> gene in the control of fusarium resistance since several major qtls for fhb resistance have been found located in the same bin position with a r <dig> ranging from 3% to 27%  <cit> .

to evaluate whether the expression of wheatpme <dig> is modulated during fusarium infection in 02-5b-318r and saragollas, suitable primers were designed in a conserved region of the gene sequences in the three genomes and used for qrt-pcr analysis of transcripts from infected and mock-inoculated spikes. wheatpme <dig> expression level was measured at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 72 hours post inoculation . in both wheat lines, the wheatpme <dig> expression level at  <dig> hpi did not show significant difference in comparison with the mock-inoculated controls . in 02-5b-318r, the level of wheatpme <dig> expression tends to decrease showing a 1-fold lower expression at  <dig> hpi. it is possible that during fusarium infection, plants down regulate wheatpme <dig> to ensure a higher degree of cw methylesterification which would protect the cw against fusarium pectic enzymes. on the contrary, in susceptible saragollas spikes the expression level of wheatpme <dig> showed a 2-fold increase at 48hpi in comparison with the non-infected control, and then dropped back to the basal expression level. consistently with this observation, the analysis of wheat 61 k genechip annotated at plexdb database  indicated that the expression of wheatpme <dig> is only induced by fusarium in the susceptible hexaploid wheat cv. chinese spring but not in a line carrying a resistance locus from the wild thinopyrum elongatum chromosome 7e  <cit>  which supports the involvement of this specific pme isoform in wheat response to fhb. the induced expression of wheatpme <dig> in the susceptible saragollas line at  <dig> hpi likely contributes to the observed greater reduction of pectin methylesterification and increased pectin degradation in comparison with 02-5b-318r, making saragollas cws likely more susceptible to fungal cwdes action and tissue more accessible to fungal colonization. fusarium growth was assessed by measuring the expression of beta-tubulin  <dig> gene  in spikes from infected and mock-inoculated 02-5b-318r and saragollas plants . the βtub <dig> expression showed increased levels at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpi in both inoculated lines, however, to a higher extent in the susceptible saragollas reflecting an increased fungal growth in these plants. this result also indicates that the repression of wheatpme <dig> observed in 02-5b-318r was most likely, due to a negative regulation of the gene.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
different mechanisms of disease resistance of wheat against f. graminearum have been elucidated, mainly in common wheat. these include the specific activation of defense signaling pathways, detoxification/ tolerance and resistance to fungal toxins, and the induction of plant defense secondary metabolites  <cit> . durum wheat is one of the most susceptible cereals to f.graminearum infection and breeding for the fhb resistance is complicated by the lack of resistance sources. it was speculated that durum wheat either lacks resistance genes or carries effective susceptibility factors and/or suppressor genes that compromise fhb resistance  <cit> .

emerging evidence indicates that content and composition of cell wall polymers affect the susceptibility of cell wall to cwdes and can play a role in the outcome of host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . in this study we provide a comprehensive overview of cell wall composition of spikes at anthesis, a key developmental stage particularly susceptible to fusarium infection, from a resistant common wheat and a susceptible durum wheat genotypes. the comparative cw analysis revealed constitutive differences in monolignol composition of lignin, with a higher amount of s-type lignin present in the resistant 02-5b-318r wheat as compared to the saragollas susceptible plants. we also detected differences in hemicellulose and pectic polymers of the cell wall in spikes of the two genotypes. in particular, resistant line was enriched in axs with a higher degree of arabinose substitution. the cw of resistant line contained a higher amount of methylesterified pectin with a less random distribution of methylated gala.

the analysis of degree of methylesterification and monosaccharide composition of the cell wall of spikes at early stages of fusarium infection indicated an higher demethylesterification and an higher extent of pectin degradation in the susceptible line as compared to 02-5b-318r. we propose that cell wall differences between the susceptible and resistant genotype could contribute to the different polysaccharide degradation we observed at early stage of f.graminearum infection as well as could influence the outcome of the disease. cell wall genes which regulating the cell wall traits identified could be involved in fhb resistance. among these genes, wheatpme <dig> was identified, characterized and proposed to participate in the control of pectin methylesterification during the interaction of wheat with f. graminearum. in addition to the cell wall components here identified, other cell wall traits are known to be involved in monocot resistance to fusarium  <cit> . examples are the cell wall‐bound thionins, having growth inhibition activity toward pathogens as well as callose and structural hydroxyproline‐rich glycoproteins, both involved in cell wall reinforcement at the site of pathogen infection  <cit> . moreover, inhibitors of cwdes such as polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins , pmeis, triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitors  and xylanase inhibitor proteins , influencing cell wall degradability during infection, have been associated to wheat resistance against fusarium  <cit> . all these cell wall traits are potential molecular markers useful in plant breeding programs targeted to the selection of wheat varieties with a durable resistance to fusariosis.
