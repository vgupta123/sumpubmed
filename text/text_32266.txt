BACKGROUND
β-lactams are bactericidal antibiotics that target the peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell wall by covalently binding to the penicillin-binding proteins. this inhibits the last stage of peptidoglycan synthesis, namely the crosslinking formation  <cit> . gram-negative bacteria generally respond to β-lactam antibiotics by either  rapid cell lysis,  the production of cell-wall-deficient round cells or  filament formation  <cit> . most β-lactam antibiotics cause filamentation in susceptible gram-negative bacteria at low concentrations  <cit> . these morphology changes often depend on the antibiotic concentration and the binding site specifications  <cit> . greenwood et al. found that cephalosporins, such as cefotaxime, induce filament production from susceptible escherichia coli up to a concentration of 2 mg/l  <cit> . however, only limited knowledge is available about morphology changes in β-lactam resistant bacteria treated with β-lactams. demirel et al. recently found that extended spectrum β-lactamase producing uropathogenic e. coli changed their morphology into filamentous forms when treated with ceftibuten  <cit> . however, the bacteria did not change morphology when treated with trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin.

in this study, we investigated the morphology changes of extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing e. coli  exposed to cefotaxime at sub-inhibitory and therapeutic concentrations. the objectives of this study were i) to determine if an antibiotic resistant ctx-m-1-producing e. coli exposed to cefotaxime at sub-inhibitory and therapeutic concentrations produced filaments, even though the strain is resistant to β-lactams and ii) to evaluate if the filamentation was growth phase and antibiotic concentration dependent.

methods
bacterial strains
the bacteria used in this study carried blactx-m- <dig> on the chromosome ) and on an inci <dig> plasmid ). the strains have previously been described in detail  <cit> . two control strains, mg1655/ncs and mg1655/inci1/ncs containing a non-coding sequence  in the chromosome and on an inci <dig> plasmid, respectively, with the same length as blactx-m- <dig> were constructed to control for insertion site and plasmid. the ncs was cloned into the pseudo gene ybem  <cit>  of e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig> using the lambda red recombination system as described previously  <cit> . plasmid p <dig> was used to construct template vectors. sequences of oligonucleotides used for lambda red mediated mutagenesis and pcr verifications were: ncs-ybem-f: 5′- atgctggtggcacttcaggcaggaaacatcgtcgcccgtaattacgcatgattataatgcgtcagcc-3′, ncs-ybem-r: 5′-aggcggcaggaagtaccaggatttcagctccctgtaatcgtgtaggctggagctgcttc-3′, ncs-inci1-f: 5′-cacacgtggaatttaggttagactataaatagaaaaattacgcatgattataatgcgtcagcc-3′, inci1-r: 5′-tctaaggcgataaacaaaaacggaatgagtttccccattcgtgtaggctggagctgcttc-3′, ncs-f: 5′-gattataatgcgtcagcccgtgtagg-3′ and ncs-r: 5′-gatagtagtccgcccattcgaacgg-3′. insertions were confirmed by pcr and sequencing using standard procedures. strains were maintained in difco™ lysogeny broth , lennox  and on lb agar plates . during strain construction the medium was supplemented with kanamycin   when appropriate.

growth conditions
bacterial morphology was investigated by performing growth experiments on an ocelloscope  for 24 hours at 37°c . cultures were prepared in aliquots of 100 μl mueller hinton ii  broth  supplemented with  <dig> to 512 mg/l of cefotaxime   for the resistant strains and supplemented with  <dig> to 4 mg/l of cefotaxime  for the sensitive strains. the cultures were inoculated with 1– <dig> single colonies from a blood agar plate  supplemented with 5% blood from cattle) to a final cell density of 106 cfu/ml, using a sensititre™ nephelometer  with a mcfarland  <dig>  standard . cefotaxime was added to the media just before inoculation with cells from blood plates. images of the cultures were acquired with 10-minute intervals through the ocelloscope bright field camera . the growth of the cultures was also measured by the ocelloscope using a background corrected absorption algorithm )  <cit> . for more detailed pictures culture material was investigated in a zeiss microscope with a ph <dig> plan-neoflur 100x/ <dig>  oli, ∞/ <dig>  lens with a zeiss axiocam camera.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing
the mic of cefotaxime was determined using the broth microdilution method following the clsi guidelines  <cit> , as described previously  <cit> .

RESULTS
the mic of cefotaxime for the two isogenic β-lactam resistant strains, mg1655/ctx-m- <dig> carrying blactx-m- <dig> on the chromosome and mg1655/inci1/ctx-m- <dig> carrying blactx-m- <dig> on an inci <dig> plasmid have been determined in a previous study and were 168 mg/l ± 4 mg/l and 252 mg/l ± 4 mg/l, respectively  <cit> . the mics of cefotaxime were  <dig>  mg/l,  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l for the three sensitive control strains e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig>  mg1655/ncs, and mg1655/inci1/ncs, respectively.

normal sized growing cells were observed in the cultures of cefotaxime-resistant mg1655/ctx-m- <dig> and mg1655/inci1/ctx-m- <dig> when grown without cefotaxime . however, filaments were observed in all cultures with 1 mg/l to 512 mg/l of cefotaxime already in the lag and early exponential growth phase , and the filaments remained the predominant cell format, and right after onset to exponential phase . in cultures of the resistant strains with concentrations of cefotaxime below the mic, normal sized cells started to be seen together with elongated cells when the culture entered exponential phase , and in exponential growth phase, this cell type was the dominant one . the filaments were up to  <dig> times longer than normal sized cells . in cultures with cefotaxime at or above the mic of the two resistant strains, elongated cells formed and were present 2 hours after inoculation even though no further growth was seen in the culture . in these cultures, spheroplats were observed after 14– <dig> hours .figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study we investigated the morphology changes of ctx-m-1-producing e. coli exposed to cefotaxime at sub-mic, mic and above mic concentrations. paulander et al. have previously demonstrated filamentation of wild-type e. coli mg <dig> cells when exposed to ampicillin  and norfloxacin , when the cultures reached a cell density of  <dig> cells/ml  <cit> . this corresponds well to the morphological response observed in the present study for cefotaxime-sensitive e. coli mg <dig> cells, where filament formation was found to be the response to cefotaxime at both sub-mic and mic concentrations. other studies also demonstrated that filament production occurs in sensitive gram-negative strains  <cit> . in the current study we showed that e. coli resistant to β-lactams by an extended-spectrum β-lactamase, blactx-m- <dig>  also produced filaments when exposed to cefotaxime. in a recent study performed by demirel et al. it was shown that ctx-m-15-producing uropathogenic e. coli changed its morphology into filamentous forms when treated with ceftibuten  <cit> . these observations are in correlation with the ones observed in this study. the filament formation in this current study was observed as an initial growth response, irrespective of the antibiotic concentration, and filaments were observed in both lag and early logarithmic phase. when the cultures grew in the logarithmic phase normal size cell started to become dominant. hence, the filamentation was restricted to certain growth phases and happened as an initial response to the cefotaxime treatment. filamentation has been suggested to be involved in bacterial survival during antimicrobial therapies  <cit> . hence, filamentation could be an intended response of the bacteria when it is stressed and threatened to be killed by antibiotics  <cit> .

in the sensitive strains cultured with sub-mic concentrations of cefotaxime, the growth continued in a filament network manner throughout the whole growth cycle, after the filaments were observed approximately 2 hours after the inoculation. cefotaxime is active in the periplasm of e. coli, where it gets hydrolysed by the ctx-m- <dig> β-lactamase in the resistant strains. according to ecocyc more than  <dig> cell division proteins exists. a study by spartt showed that β-lactams that specifically inhibit cell division, bind preferentially to penicillin binding protein  <dig>   <cit> . cefotaxime shows high affinity for pbp <dig>  which is required for septum formation. studies have shown that when pbp <dig> is inhibited, the cells produce filaments  <cit> . previous studies also showed that sula  and capr are involved in the filamentation of e. coli  <cit> . furthermore, miller et al. showed that the sos-promoting reca, lexa and dpia are involved in inhibiting cell division  <cit> . it is speculated that initially cefotaxime binds to pbp <dig> in the resistant strains, which induce the production of filaments. however, when ctx-m- <dig> was produced in high enough quantities in the resistant cells, cefotaxime was hydrolysed and not able to bind to pbp <dig> anymore. the cells then initiate growth with normal sized cells. in a previous study of ours it was shown that the ctx-m- <dig> protein levels increased  <dig> fold or more from lag to logarithmic phase  <cit> , which suggests that it is not until logarithmic phase that high enough ctx-m- <dig> concentrations are present to degrade the drug. furthermore, the time the cells grew as filament forms was antibiotic concentration dependent , which corresponds nicely with that it would take longer time for the ctx-m- <dig> enzyme to hydrolyse the drug “completely”, the higher the cefotaxime concentration, thus, prolonging the time before growth with normal sized cells can initiate. as the sensitive cells are not able to hydrolyse cefotaxime at all, they grow in filament forms in the entire growth cycle when sub-mic concentrations of cefotaxime were present.

as mentioned, filaments were observed with all cefotaxime concentrations tested, which suggest that the filamentation formation per se was not concentration dependent. elongated cells were developed and observed 2 hours after inoculation in cultures even with cefotaxime concentrations at or above the mic. no further growth was observed in these cultures; however, the resistance strains did also not undergo further morphological changes for 14– <dig> hours and the sensitive cells did not undergo further morphological changes at all in the time investigated. this is very interesting as cefotaxime is a bactericidal drug, and more investigations are needed to fully understand this phenomenon and to demonstrate whether such cells have the ability to re-enter into a growing stage. finally after 14– <dig> hours, spheroplats which are osmotically fragile cells  <cit>  were observed in the cultures of the resistance strains at or above mic. that fact that filaments were observed in the first 2 hours after inoculation at all cefotaxime concentrations, even those at or above mic, suggests that it takes approximately 2– <dig> hours before the cefotaxime concentrations in the periplasm is high enough to fully be active. it has been shown that cefotaxime has a rather slow bacterial diffusion rate through porin-channels of e. coli k- <dig>  <cit> , which may be a contributing factor to this observation.

CONCLUSIONS
these results show that resistant e. coli undergoes the same morphological changes as sensitive e. coli in the presence of β-lactam antibiotic in the lag and initial logarithmic phase. however, when the β-lactams had been degraded to a critical concentration, the cells initiate growth with normal sized cells, in contrast to the sensitive strains, which continued growth in a filament network manner. the results suggest that the filamentation is an initial response to the cefotaxime treatment regardless of whether the bacteria are resistant or not.
