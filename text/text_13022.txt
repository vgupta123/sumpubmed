BACKGROUND
germination of dormant bacillus spores and subsequent outgrowth can be induced by various nutrients  recognised by receptor proteins encoded by the gera family operons  <cit>  and located in the inner membrane of the spore  <cit> . one or several germination receptor operons have been detected in the genomes of almost all spore formers, and supported by studies of different mutants it has been concluded that spores respond to germinants via receptors diverged from common ancestor . studies of receptor/germinant interactions have so far mainly been focusing on species belonging to bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium and bacillus anthracis  <cit> . bacillus licheniformis, another gram-positive, spore forming soil bacterium closely related to b. subtilis  <cit> , has on the other hand gained much less attention. b. licheniformis is a frequent contaminant of foods, and is a common spoilage organism of dairy products  <cit> , bread  <cit> , packaged meats  <cit>  and canned goods  <cit> . it has previously been considered non-pathogenic, and has been widely used in the industry for production of enzymes, antibiotics and biochemicals  <cit> . however, b. licheniformis-associated bovine abortion  <cit> , implant infection  <cit> , corneal ulcer  <cit> , bacteraemia sepsis  <cit>  and food poisoning  <cit>  raise the question of its pathogenic potential. some strains of b. licheniformis associated with human disease are capable of producing lichenysin a, a surfactin-like toxin  <cit> . due to its association with food-borne illness and spoilage, and its ability to undergo sporulation,  <cit> , extended knowledge about the germination apparatus of b. licheniformis is of general interest. to ensure microbiological safe food production of durable foods produced by relatively mild heat treatment, there is an obvious need for more information on spore forming bacteria.

based on existing literature, b. subtilis could be considered as the model organism for germinant receptor studies. it was through early studies of germination defective mutants, that the theory of a l-alanine-induced germinant receptor was proposed  <cit> . later studies identified the gera locus as a tricistronic operon weakly expressed during sporulation, and that the polypeptide products of gera probably formed a membrane associated complex  <cit> . the products of each of the three genes of gera were later named geraa, gerab and gerac, and were demonstrated to be simultaneously required for the spore to respond to l-alanine as sole germinant  <cit> . genome sequence analysis and germination experiments of different mutants further identified four other tricistronic gera homologs for b. subtilis; gerb, gerk, ynddef and yfkqrt  <cit> . receptors encoded by two of these operons, gerb and gerk, are confirmed functional when acting cooperatively with each other or with gera  <cit> .

homologous genes of germinant receptors belonging to the gera family have been found in most spore formers, although the exact number, organisation and corresponding response germinant may vary for different species and even strains  <cit> . b. licheniformis atcc  <dig> is also predicted to possess potential germinant receptor proteins belonging to both the gera and the gerk clades  <cit> . the geraa, gerab and gerac protein sequences of b. licheniformis atcc <dig> are closely related to the protein sequences of the corresponding germinant receptor subunits of bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis  <dig>  these are in b. subtilis encoded by the gera operon, geraa, gerab and gerac. since b. subtilis gera germination is triggered by l-alanine  <cit> , it is plausible that the b. licheniformis gera operon also is involved in l-alanine germination. it has earlier been documented that spores of b. licheniformis from different strains actually respond to l-alanine as germinant  <cit> , but to our knowledge, there are no functional studies of receptor/germinant interactions of strains belonging to b. licheniformis.

mutational studies of b. licheniformis, including the fully sequenced b. licheniformis atcc 14580/dsm  <dig> strain  <cit> , have long been a challenge, most likely due to their possession of a restriction apparatus destroying foreign dna  <cit> . the construction of a more easily transformable mutant, b. licheniformis mw <dig>  has largely overcome this challenge  <cit> .

in order to facilitate the understanding of germinant/receptor interactions in b. licheniformis, we have constructed disruption and complementation mutants of the geraa locus in b. licheniformis mw <dig>  spores of these mutants have been studied in germination assays with l-alanine, casein hydrolysate and the non-nutrient germinant ca2+dipicolinic acid . these studies reveal that gera is a main germinant receptor complex of b. licheniformis recognising amino acid, and supports the view that l-alanine is an important nutrient-germinant for this species.

RESULTS
construction of the disruption and complementation mutants
to elucidate the role of the hypothetical gera proteins during spore germination, a disruption mutant of the geraa locus in b. licheniformis mw <dig> was constructed. b. licheniformis mw <dig> was used as target strain due to its superior transformability compared to its fully sequenced parent strain dsm  <dig>  <cit> . the geraa mutant, nvh- <dig>  was constructed so that a part of the geraa gene was substituted with a spectinomycin resistance cassette. this will cause the mutant to acquire spectinomycin resistance, and in addition, affect a potential phenotype related to the disrupted gene. if the target gene is part of an operon, which is the case of geraa, downstream transcripted genes will also be affected, and the receptor non functional. sequence analysis showed that in addition to harbouring the spectinomycin cassette in the geraa locus, nvh- <dig> also harboured two additional mutations  in the geraa locus. these mutations were most likely acquired during pcr amplification of the fragments used to construct the disruption vector . these mutations were "accepted"  due to their location in the gene targeted for disruption. however, in construction of the plasmid used for geraa complementation, a polymerase with a higher expected fidelity was applied to limit the risk of such mutations. sequence analysis of the complementation plasmid pht315_mw3gera revealed no mutations in the amplified gera operon when compared to the sequence of veith et al. <cit> .

genetic modification studies have shown that the germination rates could be significantly increased when specific germinant receptors are over-expressed in b. subtilis  <cit> . thus, expression of germinant receptors is apparently not optimised for maximal spore germination, forwarded as a possible evolutionary strategy to prevent premature germination at nutrient conditions inadequate for sustained vegetative growth  <cit> . very high levels of receptor expression could on the other hand have a negative effect on the sporulation process  <cit> . in such cells, the forespore lyses during the process of sporulation, perhaps as a result of premature forespore germination  <cit> . an appropriate evolutionary adaptation of germinant receptor expression/regulation is thus crucial to allow the cyclic transition between sporulation and germination upon environmental changes. in the construction of the complementation mutants in our study, certain precautions were therefore taken to avoid extensive over-expression of the complemented germinant receptor genes. by including some of the flanking regions of the geraa, gerab and gerac fragment in the complementation plasmid, we wanted to maintain the native regulatory elements of this locus. in addition, a shuttle-vector with an expected low or moderate copy number was sought as a basis for the complementation plasmid. to our knowledge, there is no shuttle-vector available for b. licheniformis where the copy number is demonstrated to be low or moderate. however, arantes and lereclus  <cit>  have constructed the pht <dig> e. coli/b. thuringiensis shuttle-vector, with a copy number of ~  <dig> per equivalent b. thuringiensis chromosome. this vector has successfully been used in germinant receptor complementation studies in b. megaterium  <cit> , and was thus considered as a reasonable choice for b. licheniformis. despite that this vector has shown to be stably maintained in b. thuringiensis and b. megaterium without a selective pressure  <cit> , the antibiotic erythromycin had to be included to ensure persistence of the complementation plasmid during sporulation of the b. licheniformis complementation mutant nvh- <dig>  this could be due to a different segregation stability of the vector in b. licheniformis. another possibility is that there is a potential elevated risk of plasmid curing due to sporulation at a high temperature. sporulation of b. licheniformis mw <dig>  nvh- <dig> and nvh- <dig> were performed at  <dig> Â°c since a pilot study showed that sporulation at this temperature was faster, yielded more stable spores  and a higher percentage of phase bright spores .

disruption of geraa abolish l-alanine and casein hydrolysate induced germination
decrease in absorbance at ~  <dig> nm  is used as a convenient method to monitor and compare germination of different spore populations  <cit> . a fall in absorbance reflects a change in the refractive index  of the multiple individual spores in a suspension, associated with germination events such as the excretion of spore's depot of ca2+-dpa, followed by water influx, cortex degradation and core swelling  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a representative experiment where different strains of heat activated  spores  are supplemented with the germinant l-alanine. at these conditions, a clear change in absorbance was observed for spores of wild type  and wild type complementation mutant  supplemented with l-alanine. less than a 5%/h decrease in absorbance was observed for spores of the disruption mutant . phase-contrast images captured at the end of the germination assay , a technique where germinated and dormant spores appear dark and white/bright respectively  <cit> , supports the absorbance measurements showing that spores of the wild type  and wild type complementation mutant  germinate with l-alanine. no apparent increase in number of phase dark spores was observed for spores of the deletion mutant  supplemented with l-alanine, or the negative controls. together with the absorbance measurements, this shows that the introduced disruption of the geraa gene abolishes the ability of b. licheniformis mw <dig> to use l-alanine as a germinant. the fact that the nvh- <dig> complementation mutant showed a similar l-alanine triggered germination phenotype as the wild type spores, supports the hypothesis that an undisrupted copy of the geraa, gerab and gerac genes, with flanking elements, are required for normal germination of b. licheniformis mw <dig> at these conditions. these findings were also supported by experiments performed with an alternative germination buffer;  <dig> mm tris hcl ph  <dig>   <dig> mm kcl .

an earlier study where germination in seven strains of b. licheniformis was investigated, showed that out of  <dig> amino acids tested, only l-alanine, l-cysteine and l-valine markedly stimulated germination  <cit> . in general, a greater germination response with l-alanine than with l-cysteine and l-valine was observed  <cit> . to assay the germination response of mw <dig>  nvh- <dig> and nvh- <dig> to several amino acids, casein hydrolysate was used. casein hydrolysate consists of a mixture of amino acids made from acid hydrolyzation of the milk protein casein and has been used as a germinant for clostridium bifermentans and b. cereus in earlier studies  <cit> . in our study, casein hydrolysate proved to be a potent germinant for b. licheniformis, giving a rapid germination response  both for the wild type mw <dig> and the complementation mutant nvh- <dig>  the mutant nvh- <dig>  which most likely lacks a gera receptor, did not show any germination response in casein hydrolysate .

d-alanine is a well-known inhibitor of l-alanine germination of b. subtilis and b. licheniformis  <cit> . d-alanine has also been shown to reduce l-valine induced germination of b. subtilis  <cit> , but we are not aware of studies reporting the effect of d-alanine on l-valine induced germination of b. licheniformis. in order to abolish germination by l-alanine present in the casein hydrolysate, we added d-alanine in some of the above experiments. in these experiments, the germination response of both mw <dig> and nvh- <dig> was hardly measurable , indicating that l-alanine through its triggering of the gera receptor is an important germinant of b. licheniformis. the contribution to germination of the remaining amino acids in the casein hydrolysate when d-alanine was present, appear to be minimal. although one can not rule out that d-alanine also inhibits the effect of other amino acids present in casein hydrolysate , all the findings support the view that gera and l-alanine constitute one of the main germination pathways of b. licheniformis.

germination of b. licheniformis with ca2+-dpa
in order to by-pass the spore germination receptor apparatus, experiments using exogenous ca2+-dpa to trigger germination of spores of b. licheniformis mw <dig> and the mutant strain nvh- <dig> were performed. in b. subtilis spores, ca2+-dpa induced germination is believed to act through activation of the cortex lytic enzyme cwlj, without any requirement of functional germinant receptors  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis of complete genomes of different spore formers has shown that also b. licheniformis contains a b. subtilis homologous cwlj gene  <cit> . if the germination apparatus of b. licheniformis spores is similar to that of its close relative b. subtilis, the wild type and disruption mutant of b. licheniformis should exhibit a similar germination response as b. subtilis to exogenous ca2+-dpa. the dpa concentration needed to trigger germination in b. subtilis is ~  <dig> -  <dig> mm, supplemented together with equal  amounts of ca2+   <cit> . also spores of b. cereus and b. megaterium germinate when exposed to ca2+-dpa  <cit> . for b. cereus it has been shown that a final level of  <dig> mm ca2+-dpa is sufficient to ensure germination  <cit> . in our experiments , b. licheniformis spores of mw <dig>  the mutant nvh- <dig> and b. subtilis spores of strain b <dig>  germinated effectively after  <dig> hours exposure in room temperature at a final concentration of  <dig> mm dpa and  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  further, at  <dig> mm dpa  <dig> mm cacl <dig> spores of b. cereus atcc  <dig> germinated effectively whilst spores of b. subtilis strain b <dig> showed a moderate germination response. b. licheniformis mw <dig> and nvh- <dig> exhibited a weak germination response even after a prolonged exposure of ~ <dig> h at these concentrations. at  <dig> mm dpa  <dig> mm cacl <dig> b. cereus atcc  <dig> germinated moderately whilst spores of mw <dig>  nvh- <dig> and b. subtilis b <dig> did not germinate . earlier ca2+-dpa germination studies with other b. licheniformis strains in our collection have yielded similar results with less effective ca2+-dpa induced germination compared to b. cereus atcc  <dig> and spores of b. pumilus . reasons for a reduced sensitivity to ca2+-dpa as a non-nutrient germinant in b. licheniformis mw <dig> spores compared to spores of some other spore forming bacteria is unknown. it might be that the relationship between ca2+ and dpa or the concentration of the chelate is not ideal for b. licheniformis germination. another possibility is that a so far uncharacterised non-nutrient inducing germinant or a mixture of dpa with other ions than ca2+ is needed for effective cwlj mediated germination of b. licheniformis. it has been shown in earlier studies that for instance strains of b. megaterium also germinate in mixtures with other ions than ca2+  <cit> . more information on cwlj and other enzyme interactions with ca2+-dpa is needed to get a clear view on which mechanisms form the basis for the different effects of ca2+-dpa germination in b. licheniformis, b. cereus and b. subtilis. further characterisation of ca2+-dpa dependent germination of b. licheniformis is currently carried out by our group.

CONCLUSIONS
as demonstrated by genetic mutation and complementation analysis, this study reveals that the geraa gene in b. licheniformis mw <dig> has a fundamental role in germination triggered by l-alanine and casein hydrolysate. we also show that d-alanine is an important inhibitor in b. licheniformis amino acid-induced germination. further, both wild type and the geraa disruption mutant germinated effectively when exposed to appropriate levels of the non-nutrient germinant ca2+-dpa which by-pass the spore receptor apparatus. however, effective germination with ca2+-dpa seems both strain and species specific. in order to understand and potentially control the germination behaviour of b. licheniformis spores, disclosure of factors involved in the transition from a dormant spore to a metabolically active proliferating cell is of prime importance. although complete elucidation of the function and cooperation of the different germinant receptors are rather laborious, this study has taken a step in the direction of obtaining more knowledge about this less studied species. the availability of both disruption and complementation mutants will facilitate further research on the function of the gera receptor of b. licheniformis mw <dig>  as well as its potential involvement in germination triggered by alternative nutrients and cooperation with other germinant receptors. further bioinformatic and phenotypic investigations are in progress in our laboratory and might eventually provide insight relevant for improved spore decimation techniques by the use of induced germination.
