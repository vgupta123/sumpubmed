BACKGROUND
dideoxynucleotide sequencing of dna or sanger sequencing has been the gold standard for mutation screening for over two decades. in recent years, the emergence of benchtop next generation sequencing  has offered a powerful alternative for mutation detection. compared to sanger sequencing, benchtop ngs can detect mutations from a significantly larger number of samples in parallel, in a more cost effective manner  <cit> . nevertheless, several studies have compared currently available benchtop sequencers to determine their mutation detection accuracy . these studies have highlighted that the accuracy of mutation detection may need to be improved in order for ngs to become a prudent option for clinical genetic testing  <cit> .

the ion torrent pgm is a semiconductor based benchtop dna sequencer, which was launched in  <dig>  the pgm generates dna sequencing reads by detecting ions released when deoxribonucleotide triphospates are incorporated into a growing dna strand on a semiconductor device  <cit> . a growing number of studies have utilized the pgm to detect genetic variation associated with human diseases . in general, the pgm performed well in accurately detecting single nucleotide variations  but the overall specificity remained low due to the high false positive rate for indel detection  <cit> . in particular, it has been documented that indel errors occurring in homopolymer dna regions have significantly affected the specificity of indel detection  <cit> . due to the nature of the sequencing chemistry of pgm, any genomic region with consecutively identical dna bases  will have a higher indel calling error rate than other genomic regions, as a result of uncertainty in determining the signal intensity that represents the precise number of homopolymer bases . for clinical genetic tests, a low false positive rate is necessary if the clinical laboratory is screening for deleterious mutations using the pgm for tens or hundreds of patients.figure  <dig>

to rectify the problem of high false positive rates for indel detection, since late  <dig> ion torrent has conducted multiple upgrades of the torrent suite , the proprietary analytical workflow for the ion torrent benchtop sequencers. a more recent version of the torrent suite variant caller  uses bam files which include flow signal information . in theory, the use of flow signal information is expected to improve the accuracy of variant calling. it is currently unknown if these upgrades affect the specificity and sensitivity of variant detection in clinical data and how the tsvc performs when compared to open source variant callers that do not consider flow signal information.

recently, costa et al. presented a workflow for use of the ion torrent pgm for clinical genetic testing of the brca <dig> and brca <dig> genes  <cit> , achieving ≥  <dig> % sensitivity and only  <dig> % specificity, which is low for high-throughput clinical diagnostics. the workflow used a filter of 'variants < 15% cases' which requires prior understanding of genetic diversity of the given samples and which may result in low sensitivity for samples derived from family members or that contain highly conserved functional mutations. therefore, a better strategy that offers a similar or better sensitivity and specificity without the need of such a filtering criterion is warranted.

indel detection accuracy is highly dependent on the bioinformatics data processing pipeline and the selection of parameters within the variant calling software  <cit> . our previous study on improving the indel detection specificity of brca <dig> and brca <dig> genes using pgm implemented two simple filtering criteria: b-allele frequency  and variation of the width of gaps and inserts   <cit> . these allowed us to achieve ≥  <dig> % specificity and yet retaining 100% sensitivity. however, the estimation of baf is unreliable in regions of low read depth  <cit> . an alternative to the baf threshold – an alternative that is independent of read depth would be useful to further improve detection specificity.

the aims of this present study are first to compare the performance of the pgm platform using ts versions  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for indel detection of the brca <dig> and brca <dig> genes. second, we evaluated one open source read mapper  and two open source variant callers  to find out if they are suitable or better in calling indels. in addition, we report here that two measures, quality by depth  and varw, can substantially improve detection specificity without compromising sensitivity. a bioinformatics workflow for indel detection from our brca <dig> and brca <dig> dataset is proposed; this workflow does not require any prior knowledge of the genetic diversity of given samples. after developing the workflow, we validated it in an independent set of  <dig> samples.

methods
sample preparation and dna sequencing
dna sample preparation, sanger and ion torrent pgm sequencing were performed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, blood samples were obtained from patients attending outpatient clinics at the national cancer centre singapore with written informed consent. ethics approval for this study was obtained from the centralized institutional review board of singhealth . dna was extracted using an optimized in-house method  <cit> .

the complete coding regions of brca <dig> and brca <dig>  with ~40 bp of non-coding sequence flanking the 5' and 3' ends of each exon, were pcr amplified  <cit> . the amplicons, spanning  <dig>  bp of non-overlapping regions were sanger sequenced, with sequence alignment and variant detection carried out using seqman pro from lasergene  <dig>  .

the same pcr amplicons were used for sequencing on the ion torrent pgm. fragment libraries were constructed by dna fragmentation, barcode and adaptor ligation, library amplification, and fragment size selection using agarose gel electrophoresis. template preparation, emulsion pcr, and ion sphere particles  enrichment were carried out using the ion xpress template kit . the quality of the isps was assessed using a qubit  <dig>  fluorometer , and the isps were loaded and sequenced on a  <dig> chip . the pgm sequencing run outputs were directly loaded to the torrent server and stored as ‘.dat’ files.

read mapping
we evaluated  <dig> read mappers : mappers of torrent suite   <dig> , ts <dig>  and ts <dig>  , as well as burrows-wheeler aligner . we downloaded torrent virtual machines containing the different versions of ts  from the ion community. we downloaded bwa from http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/. the fastq files required as input by bwa were generated automatically by ts <dig> . read mappers were run with default parameters unless stated otherwise. for bwa, ‘bwasw’ was set as the algorithm for the read mapping. hg <dig> was used as the reference genome.table  <dig>

indel calling
we evaluated five indel callers in various combinations with read mappers, as shown in table  <dig>  briefly, we used the indel callers from ts <dig> , ts <dig> , and ts <dig>  , as well as the indel callers from gatk version  <dig> - <dig>   <cit>  and samtools  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . default parameters were used when ts <dig> , ts <dig>  and ts <dig>  were applied for indel calling. for indel calling using gatk <dig> - <dig> and samtools <dig> . <dig>  the raw bam files were preprocessed according to gatk's ngs data preprocessing workflow  <cit>  where deduplication, local realignment and base quality recalibration were performed. for indels called by gatk <dig> - <dig>  gatk's variantfiltration was applied to remove potential false positives indicated by strand bias, errors at the ends of reads and low read depth. when applying gatk and samtools, selected parameters were modified to achieve high sensitivity. for gatk, we set stand_call_conf =  <dig> and stand_emit_conf =  <dig>  for samtools, we set homopolymer coefficient h =  <dig>  the refseq coding exons of brca <dig> and brca <dig> genes were defined as ‘callable’ regions which covered 16023 bp of non-overlapping region.

RESULTS
performance evaluation of the torrent suite for indel detection
the performance of mutation detection in brca <dig> and brca <dig> using multiple combinations of read mappers and variant callers was evaluated in six germ-line dna samples . we compared the pgm results to results from "gold standard" sanger sequencing of the same pcr products. three 'true' indels  specific to three different samples were identified by sanger sequencing. variant calling using combination of tmap-ts and tsvc generated a range of sensitivity of between  <dig> %- <dig> %, a range of specificity of between 99%-100% and a range of fdr of between 0%- <dig> % . table  <dig> shows an improvement in sensitivity for version  <dig>  as compared to the older versions,  <dig> / <dig>  . all three versions missed one indel , and  <dig> / <dig>  missed an additional indel .

to summarize the finding for the three ts versions, the tmap-ts <dig>  + tsvc <dig>  combination had substantially better sensitivity than the other two, but with a decrease in specificity  and a higher fdr .

impact of mapping quality on detection sensitivity
it is possible that mapping quality – the accuracy with which reads are mapped to the correct location in the reference genome – could affect detection sensitivity. we examined two false negatives in the light of this possibility.

the failure of tmap-ts + tsvc <dig> / <dig>  to detect one true positive  might have been a consequence of inaccurate mapping. to explore this possibility, we examined the mapq  scores in ts <dig> / <dig>  versus ts <dig>  alignments. mapq indicates whether a read is likely to be mapped to the correct location  <cit> , with high values indicating good read mapping. the tmap-ts + tsvc <dig>  generated a mapq distribution with higher median values  than that of tmap-ts + tsvc <dig>   and tmap-ts + tsvc  <dig>   . we also manually inspected the alignment  using igv  <cit> . in comparison to the ts <dig>  alignments, ts <dig> / <dig>  alignments contain more mismatches, exhibit higher variation in size and have more erroneous gaps proximal to the indel position . these observations combined with the mapq distributions suggest that this false negative is possibly associated with reads mapped to incorrect locations.

as highlighted in the previous section, one true positive indel  was missed by all ts versions. however, it was noticed that similar median mapq values and mapq distributions were generated by ts <dig>  and ts <dig>  at this position . by manual inspection using igv, we observed relatively high coverage , sufficient non-reference allele frequency  and clean alignment profile  at this indel position. the igv inspection, taken together with the mapq scores suggest that this false negative indel call was not due to read mapping errors.

variant calling from pgm data using gatk and samtools
the three ts variant callers were unable to achieve 100% sensitivity, as shown in the previous analysis. to investigate whether applying alternative variant callers would improve the sensitivity, we also assessed two alternative, widely-used variant callers, gatk and samtools, on the brca <dig> and brca <dig> data.

both gatk and samtools achieved 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity on alignment data generated by ts <dig>  . gatk also performed better than tsvc when calling indels from alignment data of ts <dig> . along with higher sensitivity, both gatk and samtools had a lower specificity than tsvc.

to determine if the indel not detected by tsvc  was due to the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, we re-ran the variant calling with adjusted ts <dig>  variant calling parameters, in which the calling sensitivity was maximized . the single missed true positive indel  remained undetected, which suggested that gatk and samtools were more sensitive than tsvc.

gatk and samtools were also used to call indels from alignment data generated by the, bwa mapper. median mapqs at all three true positive indel positions were lower in bwa-generated alignments . nonetheless, the sensitivity of indel calling using both gatk and samtools remained as 100% .

characteristics of false positive variants detected by tsvc, gatk and samtools
the previous analyses highlighted that variant calling using tsvc <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed a problem with sensitivity . without any clear avenues to improve their sensitivities, we focused on improving the specificity of indel calling by using gatk and samtools, the variant callers in our study that had 100% sensitivity using alignments from either tmap-ts <dig>  or bwa.

although gatk and samtools were able to call variants with 100% sensitivity when applied to bam files generated by tmap-ts <dig>  and bwa, false positive indels remained detected in the six samples, with some of these workflows generating up to  <dig> false positives . to explore the utility of potential approaches to reducing the number of false positives, in the context of tsvc <dig> , gatk and samtools, we compared the distributions of four measurements associated with false positive and true positive indels. these measurements were b-allele frequency , quality score of called variant , quality by depth  and variation of the width of gaps and inserts .

b-allele frequency  represents the proportion of reads with the non-reference allele. the quality scores of called variants  were generated by the variant callers and were provided in their output vcf files. quality by depth  was computed through the division of qual by read depth. variation of the width of gaps and inserts  was calculated as described in our previous work  <cit> .

we examined the distribution of the four measurements generated by indel calling workflows that used the tmap-ts <dig>  and bwa alignments combined with the gatk and samtools variant calling. the selected workflows were denoted as ‘tmap-ts <dig>  + gatk’, ‘tmap-ts <dig>  + samtools’, ‘bwa + gatk’ and ‘bwa + samtools’ .figure  <dig> 
characteristics of true  and false  positive indels. four panels show the boxplot distributions of baf, qual, qd and varw for true  and false  positive indels detected by different indel calling workflows indicated at the top of the panels. the false positive indels detected by workflows using gatk as variant caller show higher average baf and average qual than the values of true positive indels. only qd and varw had a consistent trend detected by all workflows, with true positive indels having a higher average qd and lower average varw than the values of false positive indels.



improvement of variant calling specificity using varw threshold and qd threshold
analyzing the characteristics of true and false positive indels  suggested that qd and varw could be used to distinguish the true and false positive indels. qd thresholds  and varw thresholds  specific to gatk  and samtools  were applied to indels called by the four workflows with 100% sensitivity . the threshold values were selected to achieve maximum sensitivity and specificity based on the analysis of the distributions of qd and varw . qdth differed between the gatk and samtools due to the different qual scores generated by the two variant callers.

using these qdth and varwth filters improved the specificity of indel calling from the workflows, with ≤  <dig> false positive indel detected by the four workflows . indeed, three of four workflows achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity, and 0% fdr when qdth and varwth filters were used.table  <dig>

we evaluated the four workflows  on a test set of  <dig> additional samples with unknown mutation status. in addition to pgm sequencing, sanger sequencing of the  <dig> samples was performed to determine their true mutation status.

the four workflows differed in the number of false positives, but all achieved ≥  <dig> % specificity . when using the alignments generated by tmap-ts <dig>  and bwa for indel calling, the samtools variant caller performed best, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  false positives respectively . gatk detected  <dig>  and  <dig>  false positives respectively.table  <dig>

removal of non-homopolymer associated indel errors
from both the  <dig> training and  <dig> test samples, the majority of the false positive indels called prior to qd-varw filtering were located in homopolymers . however, some false positives were also detected in non-homopolymer regions. . these non-homopolymer-associated errors have also been reported elsewhere  <cit> . in our  <dig> samples, application of the qd filter to putative indels detected by the ts <dig>  + samtools workflow removed 75% of the non-homopolymer-associated errors, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the qd filter in minimising such errors.

discussion
the advent of ngs technology has increased sequencing capacity and lowered the cost of sequencing  <cit> , making it an appealing alternative to sanger sequencing for genetic testing. in particular, the commercial availability of benchtop sequencers since the launching of pgm by life technology in  <dig>  <cit> , has attracted interest from clinical laboratories  <cit> .

a workflow for clinical brca <dig> and brca <dig> diagnosis using pgm sequencing was recently proposed and evaluated in  <cit> . the analysis workflow was designed to detect both single nucleotide substitutions and microindels. it was based on ts <dig>  variant calls followed by several filters, including a filter to consider only variants found at frequencies < 15% in the tested population. the snv calling using this workflow was impressive, with a100% sensitivity and an fdr of 1/ <dig> or 25%  when polymorphisms were not included in the evaluation. for microindels, this pipeline had on average one false discovery per sample, with an fdr of 20/ <dig> or 87% . this is a high rate for clinical diagnosis .

the overall performance of snv detection using the proprietary workflows was less problematic than indel detection in our study . generally, the ts workflows perform better in terms of sensitivity in which 100% sensitivity were achieved. but ts workflows generated more false positive snvs, with an fdr as high as  <dig> % as compared to workflows using samtools and gatk as variant callers, an estimate comparable to that of the previous finding  <cit> .

therefore we focused entirely on evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of indel detection due to the high fdr in the previous study  <cit> . our study further investigated the characteristics of the indel errors and then developed a simple workflow that combines either the tmap-ts <dig>  or bwa with the samtools variant caller. these workflows achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than the ts workflows or the workflow reported by costa et al. in reference  <cit> . for our combined training and test data, the fdr for tmap-ts <dig>  and samtools was 2/ <dig>  and 4/ <dig>  for bwa and samtools.

despite the improved fdrs of indel detection, the rates remain relatively high using the tmap-ts <dig>  and samtools as well as the bwa and samtools workflows for clinical genetic testing. with a large sample size, more systematic false positives will likely be found in multiple samples. unfortunately, it is challenging to eliminate these false positives by defining a threshold based on mutation frequency of these samples. interestingly, we observed a false positive indel filtered by qdth in one sample that marginally escaped filtering in another sample. we thus proposed to remove indels detected in a specific sample that were also found in the set of indels filtered by qdth and varwth from other samples. using this strategy, we managed to eliminate an additional false positive from each workflow without compromising sensitivity, achieving an fdr of 1/ <dig>  for tmap-ts <dig>  and samtools, and 3/ <dig>  for bwa and samtools. nonetheless, larger sample sizes and additional sample sets that have common true positive indels will be required in order to test the performance of this strategy.

CONCLUSIONS
the newer versions of ts have shown improvements in both the alignment and variant calling performance, which in turn increased indel calling sensitivity and specificity. however, even the very recent ts variant caller  had a lower sensitivity than the gatk or samtools variant callers. here, we present a computational workflow that  uses the ts <dig>  or bwa as the read mapper  samtools as the variant caller and  varwth and qdth as post-variant-calling filters. this workflow resulted in indel detection with overall 100% sensitivity, ≥  <dig> % specificity and ≤ 44% fdr of all  <dig> samples . our findings demonstrate that a significant reduction of the false positives can be achieved with an effective computational indel calling workflow. nevertheless, the wide range of confidence intervals due to the small sample size in this study suggests that a larger data with known true indels will be required for achieving a more conclusive estimation of the sensitivity and fdr.figure  <dig>
