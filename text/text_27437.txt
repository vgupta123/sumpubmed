BACKGROUND
increasing anthropogenic emissions of co <dig> induce ocean warming and acidification. these changes in environmental conditions may have adverse effects on marine organisms . however, the responses to ocean acidification  are highly variable between organisms  <cit>  based on the fact that various animals differ in their capacities to compensate for acid–base disturbances caused by elevated seawater co <dig> and resulting blood hypercapnia for review see  <cit> . organisms with low compensation abilities show depressed metabolism, altered energy budgets, and as a result, lower rates of growth or development . in contrast, organisms compensating for acid–base disturbances through active ion transport, such as fish, cephalopods and some crustaceans are projected to be more tolerant towards oa  <cit> . in parallel to these differential capacities, sensitivities within a phylum seem to be related to differences in lifestyle and associated energy turnover  <cit> . furthermore, species or populations from highly variable environments with natural variations in pco <dig> may have evolved to be more tolerant than species from relatively stable environments. as an extreme example, the shallow living crab cancer magister can compensate within 24 h for hypercapnia-induced acidosis, while the extracellular acidosis in the deep-sea crab chionoecetes tanneri remains mostly uncompensated during this time  <cit> . however, such short-term studies have limited value if it comes to the projection of long-term ocean acidification effects.

the great spider crab hyas araneus is an osmoconforming, slow-moving and inactive species living in relatively stable physical conditions and is thus an excellent candidate to study the medium to long-term effects of abiotic stressors. a number of physiological studies have already investigated the effects of elevated seawater pco <dig> on this species: co <dig> induced decreases in growth rates and fitness of larvae were demonstrated in a north sea population, whereas an arctic population seemed more sensitive towards thermal stress  <cit> . in the spitsbergen population elevated seawater pco <dig>  caused an increase in metabolic rate during larval development pointing to higher metabolic costs  <cit> . adult h. araneus became more heat intolerant under elevated co <dig> with potential consequences for biogeographical distribution  <cit> . in the arctic population synergistic effects of increased temperature and pco <dig> adversely influenced the capacities for activity associated with disturbances in acid–base status  <cit> .

to understand organismal sensitivities and tolerance-limits to oa with and without concomitant warming it is important to identify and differentiate between the mechanisms that shape an organism’s capacity to cope with the projected changes. at the whole organism level, crustaceans are impacted by oa with and without concomitant warming with effects ranging from changes in acid–base homeostasis  <cit> , metabolism  <cit> , growth  <cit> , to development  <cit>  and even survival  <cit> . these processes are highly interdependent. while active acid–base regulation is an energy-consuming process  <cit> , eventually leading to enhanced metabolic requirements  <cit> , uncompensated extracellular ph can elicit metabolic depression  <cit>  via effects on transmembrane ion exchange  <cit> . furthermore, low ph can trigger a decrease in protein synthesis  <cit> ; this may result in reduction of growth under hypercapnic conditions  <cit> . these previous studies provide us with important insights into the mechanistic background of responses to ongoing oa and warming, but also highlight the complexity of the processes involved. to elaborate the sensitivities and potential tolerance limits further, it is important to investigate the key regulatory mechanisms shaping affected processes and the tradeoffs between them.

a transcriptomic approach makes it possible to simultaneously investigate the genetic response of a wide range of cellular processes, and thus to identify the early responses to environmental changes  <cit> . gene expression analyses can be used to characterize the molecular phenotype and the cellular changes that underpin physiological responses. they can also be used to uncover molecular mechanisms that might define physiological plasticity. transcriptomic analysis can further reveal the connections between response mechanisms to environmental changes such as oa or temperature that may otherwise be overlooked  <cit> . due to technological advances in recent years, analyses of the whole transcriptome have become increasingly attractive to study non-model  organisms, and their molecular responses to a variety of environmental changes such as warming  <cit> , salinity fluctuations  <cit> , hypoxia  <cit>  or oa  <cit>  in marine organisms.

in the present study, we used gene expression profiling to explore the molecular response in gills of h. araneus exposed to hypercapnia at different temperatures. in marine crustaceans, gills are the first line of defence against acid–base disturbances of body fluids and thus the most important regulatory tissue for co <dig> induced acidification of the hemolymph  <cit> . we used a quantitative transcriptomic approach based on direct cdna sequencing using high-throughput illumina sequencing  <cit> . since the present study focuses on the mechanisms involved and the potential sensitivity of h. araneus to climate changes, we selected co <dig> concentrations projected for the year  <dig> and  <dig> by the intergovernmental panel on climate change  as well as two different temperatures  were collected by scientific divers in may  <dig> in kongsfjord at the west coast of spitsbergen at 7–12 m depth  and transferred to the alfred wegener institute, bremerhaven, germany. animals were maintained at 5°c in flow through aquaria with natural seawater prior to experimentation. during this period, seawater was aerated with ambient air and animals were fed ad libitum twice per week with frozen mussels and cockles .

for the medium-term experiment, male spider crabs with a carapace width of  <dig> to 42 mm were divided into six groups and each group was randomly assigned to the different treatments. animals were exposed to three different co <dig> concentrations  and two different temperatures  for 10 weeks . for each treatment, 5– <dig> animals were individually placed in 2 l wide-mouth containers .figure  <dig> 
overview of the experimental design used in the differential expression
. animals were collected in  <dig> and acclimated to 5°c until the start of experimentation. subsequently, exposure experiments were conducted for a time period of 10 weeks for all treatments. after exposure, tissue samples were taken and total rna was extracted for analyses by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  and sequencing. sequencing data were used for differential expression analysis by deseq.



experiments were carried out in recirculating seawater co <dig> manipulation systems of  <dig> cubic meter volume each. seawater of the storage tank was pumped to a header tank at a rate of 20 l min− <dig>  which supplied the wide-mouth container by gravity feed at a flow rate of 200 ml min− <dig>  water of experimental containers was retained in a collection tank and pumped back to the storage tank at a flow rate of 20 l min− <dig>  ambient air temperature in the experimental rooms was thermostated to keep water temperature constant. seawater co <dig> manipulation was accomplished by constantly aerating the storage and header tanks with a defined air/co <dig> mixture using an automatic mass flow controller . a light–dark cycle of 12:12 h was established. water was partly changed every week by refilling the storage tank with pre-equilibrated seawater . experimental animals were fed once a week ad libitum with frozen mussels .

to monitor water physicochemistry, seawater samples were collected in airtight glass vials to prevent exchange with the atmosphere, and total dissolved carbon  concentration was immediately measured with a seal quaatro sfa analyzer . temperature, salinity and ph were measured at the time of collection and, together with dic, used to calculate the pco <dig> in seawater using co2sys  <cit> . seawater ph was measured using a ph electrode  calibrated at the respective temperature with national institute of standards and technology  standard ph buffer and salinity with a conductivity meter . for co2sys, nbs  scale of seawater ph and constants of mehrbach et al.  <cit>  refitted by dickson and millero  <cit>  were used. a summary of water physicochemistry data is given in table  <dig> table  <dig>

temperature, salinity, ph and dissolved inorganic carbon  were measured and partial pressure of co <dig>  and total alkalinity were calculated using co2sys  <cit> . data are mean ± sd with n =  <dig> , n = 16– <dig> .



after experimental exposure, all  <dig> gill pairs were collected from 5– <dig> animals in each treatment. tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°c until usage.

hemolymph sampling and measurements
directly before tissue sampling, around 1 ml of hemolymph was extracted at the coxa of the third walking leg using a 1 ml sterile syringe . hemolymph was immediately transferred to a  <dig>  ml tube , placed in a thermostatted water bath and ph was measured at acclimation temperature using a ph microelectrode . the ph meter was calibrated at the respective temperature with nist standard ph buffer. a hemolymph subsample was withdrawn using a gas-tight 200 μl syringe  and total dissolved inorganic carbon  of extracellular fluid was analysed according to the modified gas chromatographic method  <cit> . extracellular fluid was injected in gas tight glass vials containing 3 ml of air equilibrated  <dig>  m hydrogen chloride  and analysed by gas chromatography in an agilent 6890 n gc system . the bicarbonate  concentration of the extracellular fluid was calculated from cco <dig> and ph using equations derived from the henderson-hasselbalch equation. pco <dig> was calculated as pco2 = cco <dig> * − <dig> and hco3− as hco3− = cco2- αco <dig> * pco <dig>  with cco <dig> being the total co <dig> concentration in mm, αco <dig> the physical solubility of co <dig>  pco <dig> the partial pressure of co <dig> in kpa and pk the apparent dissociation constant of the co2/apparent hco3− system. αco <dig> and pk were calculated according to pörtner et al.  <cit> . raw data of hemolymph sampling and measurements are available at http://doi.org/ <dig> /pangaea. <dig> 

rna extraction and sequencing
total tissue rna of gills was extracted using the rneasy mini kit according to the purification of total rna from animal tissue protocol . rna quantities were determined by a nanodrop 2000c spectrometer , and rna was analysed for quality by microfluidic electrophoresis in an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . total rna from all gill pairs of  <dig> animals was pooled for each treatment, and used for library constructions and sequencing by gatc biotech . the cdna libraries for each treatment were constructed according to the smart protocol for illumina sequencing  and after adapter ligation pooled into two samples. to obtain appropriate deep sequencing results, samples were sequenced at least twice. illumina sequencing was performed on a hiseq  <dig> sequencer by gatc biotech . raw reads were quality controlled by fastqc  and cleaned using the fastx-toolkit . quality control and trimming was performed using the following parameters: minimum quality score of  <dig>  minimum percentage of bases within the quality score of  <dig> and a minimum length of  <dig> bases. the cleaned raw data of the illumina sequencing were deposited in the european nucleotide archive  at the european molecular biological laboratory – european bioinformatics institute  . a summary of the cleaned sequencing results for all samples is given in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

mapping and identification of differentially expressed genes
short reads of each sample were separately aligned against the annotated h. araneus transcriptome  <cit> , using the burrows-wheeler aligner   with default parameters  <cit> . obtained files were processed into bam files for further analysis, using samtools   <cit> . an overview of the mapping and efficiency is described in additional file 1: table s <dig>  differential expression analysis was conducted with the r statistic software  <cit> . read counts were summed up for all sequencing runs of each sample and used for the differential expression analysis without biological replicates. differential expression of genes was evaluated using a test based on the negative binomial distribution as integrated in the bioconductor r package deseq  <cit> , with a standard level of p ≤  <dig>  indicating significance. control  was compared to five treatments:  elevated temperature;  intermediate pco <dig> at control temperature;  high pco <dig> at control temperature  intermediate pco <dig> at elevated temperature;  high pco <dig> at elevated temperature. the previously annotated transcriptome made a gene ontology enrichment analysis possible to test for particular affected terms, using fisher’s exact test  as implemented in the blast2go software   <cit> . all subsets of significantly regulated genes identified by the binominal distribution test were tested against the full set of annotated sequences of the h. araneus transcriptome. to cut down on redundancy, go terms were summarized into a more representative subset of terms using the web-based clustering tool revigo  <cit> .

validation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
a set of transcript sequences known to be involved in acid–base regulation and/or transcripts that showed differential expression in one or more treatments was selected for validation of rna-seq results. primers were designed using the primerexpress software   with the taq-man mgb quantification method and default parameters . primer specificity was given by using sequences of the annotated h. araneus transcriptome  <cit> . all primer pairs were tested for performance and efficiency across a series of cdna dilutions . primers used displayed a suitable per cycle amplification rate, with an efficiency  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and r2 >  <dig> . efficiency was calculated as e =  <dig>  with s being the slope of linear regression.

total rna was extracted from gills as described above. ten micrograms of total rna per sample was treated with dnase for dna digestion using the turbo dna-free kit  and  <dig>  μg dna free rna was transcribed into cdna with the high-capacity cdna reverse transcription kit . real-time pcr was performed on a  <dig> real-time pcr system  and sybr® green pcr master mix . all genes were finally analysed in a 40-fold dilution and amplified with  <dig> nm of primer. to verify the amplification specificity of fragments a melting curve analysis was performed for each reaction.

gene expression calculation was based on the ct-threshold. absolute mrna quantities were calculated as qx = e and normalized with the formula qn = qx/qx, with qx being the absolute mrna quantity of the housekeeping gene sodium bicarbonate cotransporter . the housekeeping gene was determined using genorm implemented in the software qbaseplus   with a relative expression stability of m ≤  <dig>  . to ensure consistency with the differential expression results of the deseq analysis, gene expression results of the qrt-pcr were calculated as log <dig> fold change  of mean normalized quantities of treatment and control.

statistics
to identify significant differences in the sum of all significantly up- and down-regulated transcripts between treatments, significantly changed transcripts in one or more treatment, identified by the deseq analysis, were transformed into a matrix with 1 = significantly up-regulated, −1 = significantly down-regulated and 0 = not significantly regulated transcript. treatments were analysed for statistical differences applying the wilcoxon matched pairs test as implemented in sigmaplot  with p <  <dig> . data from each treatment were tested against each other.

the correlation between the differential expression results of the deseq analysis and the corresponding gene expression results of the qrt-pcr was determined by pearson correlation as implemented in sigmaplot  <dig>  .

a one-way anova was used to identify the effect of seawater pco <dig> on hemolymph ph and bicarbonate . data obtained under various pco <dig> levels were tested against each other for each temperature separately. a holm sidak test for multiple comparisons was used for a posteriori analyses. tests were performed in sigmaplot  with p <  <dig>  indicating significant differences.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> million reads  from initial illumina sequencing passed the quality filter and was used for the differential expression analysis. after processing, an average of  <dig>  million high quality reads were produced for each sample from 2– <dig> sequencing runs per sample . to obtain the differential expression of each gene, high quality reads were aligned on the h. araneus transcriptome  <cit> . an average of  <dig>  million reads for each sample produced distinct alignments. the alignment process yielded an average efficiency of 56% for the high quality reads . the achieved mapping efficiency is actually higher than in a comparable study of a non-model organism, which used an analogous approach for differential expression analysis   <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> % of all transcript sequences in the h. araneus transcriptome were detected in the rna-seq data. however, the occurrence of a large amount of unmapped reads might result from sequencing errors, repetitive sequences or inadequate quality filtering of the illumina reads. furthermore, it has to be considered that transcripts supported by only a small number of aligned reads  may reflect incompletely assembled transcripts in the reference. those poorly supported transcript sequences were excluded from the subsequent analysis, and a final test-set of  <dig>  transcripts sequences was used for the differential expression analysis. as there were no biological replicates, it has to be considered that the variance for genes can only be estimated by comparing the mean-variance relationship between samples/treatments, as if they were replicates, resulting in an overestimation of the variance and thus make this approach more conservative. furthermore, expression levels of stable and highly expressed genes, based on the rna-seq data, were analysed by quantitative real-time pcr  confirming the rna-seq methodology used in this study .

we could identify  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  tested transcripts to be differentially expressed after medium-term  exposure to the abiotic effectors . out of these differentially expressed genes   <dig> % and  <dig> % were differentially expressed under intermediate co <dig>  and high co <dig> , respectively. for the high temperature ,  <dig> % showed significantly different expression levels . the combination of factors intermediate co <dig>  and high co <dig>  with elevated temperature revealed  <dig> % and  <dig> % deg, respectively . while the total amount of significant degs was similar in all treatments, individual genes displayed large differences in up- or down-regulation . intermediate co <dig>  led to strongly up-regulated transcript levels, while high temperature  caused strong down-regulation.figure  <dig>

these general results, especially the strong up-regulation of gene expression under intermediate co <dig> , suggest that the regulatory capacity is high at moderately elevated pco <dig> in adult h. araneus but reduced at higher co <dig> levels. up-regulation was also reduced at intermediate co <dig> when combined with elevated temperature  rather than at control temperature. down-regulation in deg predominated under warming alone  when compared to control temperature .  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that displayed significantly changed transcripts in the intermediate co2/elevated temperature treatment  were also differentially expressed in the high temperature treatment  supporting a strong temperature-dependent response, in line with the hypothesis that temperature affects most biochemical processes. faced with a long-term temperature change, ectothermal organisms retain physiological homeostasis by several acclimation strategies, which can be of quantitative, qualitative or modifying nature  <cit> . the enhanced down-regulation seen in the high temperature treatments suggest that h. araneus may adopt a quantitative strategy to maintain physiological rates by down-regulating the concentrations of enzymes between  <dig> and 10°c  <cit> .

to identify processes actually responding to elevated pco <dig> and temperature, a first analysis was carried out using gene ontology  terms. the set of go-annotated differentially expressed genes was statistically tested for the over- and underrepresentation of go terms to identify molecular functions, cellular components and biological processes affected most by the experimental treatments . the go enrichment analysis revealed a variety of significantly over-represented go terms that can primarily be summarized underneath the more generic categories ‘metabolism’ and ‘cell structure’.  <dig> and  <dig> over-represented go terms, respectively, could be associated with these categories. it is important to mention that both intermediate co <dig> treatments  constitute 57% and 27% of the over-represented go terms, respectively, representing compensation mechanisms mentioned above. the only over-represented go term under high co <dig>  trehalose metabolic process, was evaluated for the down-regulated genes of the combined stress treatment . the fact that it was over-represented in all treatments indicates that enhanced expression of trehalose metabolism can be rated as a unifying response to both elevated co <dig> and elevated temperature.

within the ‘cell structure’ related go-terms, intermediate co <dig>  led to significant up-regulation of genes concerning cell surface, extracellular matrix, structural molecule activity or brush border membrane, suggesting a structural modification of the gills. some go terms were found underrepresented at high temperature and in combined, intermediate co <dig> and high temperature treatments , and are assigned mainly to intracellular structures such as organelles. the over-representation of ‘cell structure’ related go terms suggests that gill epithelial structure is adjusted in response to pco <dig> disturbances. gills are the principal organs for gas exchange and, together with the excretory organs, responsible for osmotic and ionic regulation in crustaceans  <cit> . as passive ion transport is influenced by the conductivity of gill epithelia  <cit> , their structural modification might lead to a change in conductivity and would change the diffusion rate of ions. structural changes were in fact identified in gills of carcinus maenas during salinity exposure, with a modification of the apical plasma membrane system and an enlargement of the subcuticular compartment  <cit> . as environmental hypercapnia and salinity changes can cause similar mechanistic responses  <cit> , similar transcriptomic modifications may occur. this is supported by an over-representation of the go term response to salt stress in the intermediate co <dig> treatment .

although a go enrichment analysis offers initial insights into processes affected by hypercapnia exposure and elevated temperature, a strong bias exists towards conserved and well-characterized processes, functions and cellular components in model organisms. this bias particularly applies to h. araneus, with a lack of go annotation for about 76% of the transcripts. additionally, many genes are grouped into more than one go term depending on their resolution and are thus difficult to interpret. in light of these contraints, go analysis can only provide a general overview of possibly affected processes and make a more detailed look indispensible.

for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms responding to pco <dig> and temperature changes, we performed a second analysis. here, all genes included in the most affected categories ‘metabolism’ and ‘structural modification’, identified by the go enrichment analysis, were considered. additionally, we integrated all genes related to ‘acid–base and ion regulation’ and ‘response to stress’ into our analysis, as adjustments in these mechanisms are likely relevant in shaping resistance to hypercapnia exposure or heat stress.

for the interpretation of transcriptomic results, it has to be considered that expression profiles represent one regulatory level in the response to environmental changes and thus do not necessarily reflect the changes of other regulatory levels, e.g. protein abundances and activities. at least 25% of the proteome cannot be covered by gene expression profiling  <cit> . however, there was a positive correlation between transcription and translation in 87% of genes that changed ≥ twofold in living cells of yeast strains  <cit> . certainly, a lower correlation has to be considered for more complex organisms, however an additional proteomics study on h. araneus revealed a comparable correlation between gene expression and protein abundance of ~70% for the intermediate treatment at 5°c . a transcriptomic approach can provide first insights into the regulatory processes responding to environmental changes such as oa or temperature.

response of specific groups
acid–base regulation
the extracellular ph  measured in the hemolymph of adult h. araneus showed partial compensation under intermediate co <dig> levels  involving an increase in bicarbonate  concentration . under high co <dig> , reduction in phe was greater and the increase in  was reduced . these findings suggest a limited capability to compensate for phe disturbances caused by high seawater pco <dig>  according to a crustacean model by freire et al.  <cit> , proton  excretion is generated by apical vacuolar-type -atpase -atpase) and/or sodium/proton exchanger , the latter dependent on sodium/potassium-atpase . hco3− is enriched in the hemolymph by basolateral anion exchangers. enzymes that support active ion transport are the intracellular carbonic anhydrase  and, in terms of a general support of energy consuming mechanisms, arginine kinase . ca is assumed to accelerate the dissociation of carbonic acid  and provide the substrate for h+ and hco3− transporters  <cit> . ak catalyses the reversible dephosphorylation of phosphoarginine, contributing to the restoration of adenosine triphosphate  used in energy consuming processes  <cit> . the expression of corresponding genes, v-atpase, ak and partial sequences of two alpha cas was significantly up-regulated at intermediate co <dig>  whereas such mrna concentrations were only moderately increased at high co <dig>  . these expression levels follow the course of the hemolymph hco3− parameters and the more effective acid–base regulation of adult h. araneus under moderately elevated co <dig>  however, only a few sequences encoding for na+/k+-atpase were up-regulated under co <dig>  in contrast to their response to elevated temperature treatment . under the combined effect of temperature and co <dig> na+/k+-atpase was also up-regulated. another enzyme, dopa decarboxylase, which catalyses the biosynthesis of dopamine by decarboxylation of l-dopa, was found down-regulated at moderate  co <dig> elevations . elevated dopamine leads to increased sodium influx and concomitantly, increased na+/k+-atpase activity in gills of c. maenas
 <cit> . in light of this finding constant mrna levels of na+/k+-atpase at intermediate co <dig>  indicate that the down-regulation of dopa decarboxylase may even prevent an activation of na+/k+-atpase . the gene expression of other transporters, supposed to be involved in acid–base regulation, such as nhe and/or bicarbonate/chloride co-transporter were not influenced at all by elevated pco <dig> values or temperature. acid–base regulation predominantly via the v-atpase  might involve minimal disturbance to ionic composition, e.g. cellular sodium homeostasis which would be affected by strong involvement of na+/k+-atpase. in the sipunculid s. nudus, extracellular acidosis induced a shift in ion transporters during hypercapnia from high to low energy cost mechanisms of acid–base regulation, resulting in decreased na+/k+-atpase activity due to lower requirement for sodium regulation  <cit> . in line with our present observations these results suggest a ph regulation system independent of na+/k+-atpase being used under hypercapnic exposure . no significant up-regulation of apical bicarbonate anion exchangers was observed. in c. sapidus, co <dig> induced acid–base disturbances  were mainly compensated by an uptake of hco3− from the surrounding seawater via the gill epithelia  <cit> . however, our results with no up-regulation of respective transporters suggests hemolymph buffering may be achieved through the dissociation of respiratory co <dig> resulting in an accumulation of hco3− in the hemolymph. this might be exceptionally for crustaceans with low compensatory capacities. in h. araneus, also no significant up-regulation of basolateral bicarbonate anion exchangers was observed. however, expression of the anion channel bestrophin was significantly enhanced . bestrophin is activated by calcium  and enhances membrane permeability for anions, such as chloride and hco3−
 <cit> . even though bestrophin is commonly found in the retinal pigment epithelium, ion channels of this family have been identified in different tissues and are involved in a variety of cellular processes  <cit> . its role in responses to elevated co <dig> remains to be investigated.figure  <dig>

exposure. medium-term hypercapnia acclimation leads to a shift to a new acid–base equilibrium by accumulation of hemolymph bicarbonate . co <dig> is hydrated into h+ and hco3
− by cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase . protons are actively pumped out of the epithelial cell by an apical vacuolar proton atpase -atpase), followed by a transport of hco3
− via a basolateral anion exchanger  and/or ion channel, such as bestrophin . increased energy demand is in part met by an enhanced expression of complex i  and complex iv  of the electron transport system and possibly triggered by a soluble adenylyl cyclase  induced signalling pathway. sac is stimulated by hco3
− and increases the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate , which activates protein kinase a  that subsequently leads to an induced expression of ci and civ. while enhanced aerobic metabolic processes increase the generation of oxidants, the cellular defence against oxidative stress is adversely affected by a lower production of nadph due to a decrease of the pentose phosphate pathway enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase . nadph acts as reducing agent for the regeneration of reduced glutathione  to oxidised glutathione . the symbols  and  mark significantly up- and down-regulated genes, respectively modified after  <cit> .

energy metabolism
acid–base regulation compensating for co <dig> induced disturbances likely entails a metabolic cost due to the atp demanding movement of h+ by ion transporters  <cit> . elevated metabolic rates have already been observed under hypercapnia exposure  <cit> , however, the mechanisms causing such cost increments remain unidentified. the differential expression analysis revealed an up-regulation of complex i and complex iv of the electron transport system  during exposure to intermediate co <dig> levels  . transcripts encoding for nadh dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase subunits were significantly up-regulated above control levels possibly leading to an increase in mitochondrial density to meet the increased energy demand. interestingly, complex ii and iii were not affected by hypercapnia exposure. increased activities of complex i and iv activated by protein kinase a  resulted in an increased oxidative phosphorylation and atp synthesis in human kidney cells  <cit> . the activation was triggered by a soluble adenylyl cyclase  induced signalling pathway that implies phosphorylation of pka being stimulated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate , which, in turn, is formed from sac. in mammals and in elasmobranchs it is known that sac is stimulated by hco3−
 <cit> , which would thereby support an increased activity of mitochondrial electron transport system under hypercapnia exposure. camp and pka regulate key enzymes, such as complex iv, by alterating gene expression  <cit> . considering the higher extracellular bicarbonate levels in animals under hypercapnia  this signalling pathway possibly led to the increased up-regulation in ets related genes and/or increased activity and thus might explain how the organisms meet the suggested increase in atp demand .

an increased atp production by the ets would also lead to an elevated demand for metabolic substrates and turnover of the resulting reduction equivalents . in the intermediate co <dig> treatments , the glycolytic pathway only experienced a significant up-regulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  , whereas the rate-limiting enzymes phosphofructokinase or pyruvate kinase remained unaffected, suggesting no general up-regulation of glycolysis. however, the enhanced expression of sodium glucose transporter indicates increased capacity for glucose transport from the hemolymph into the gill cells . trehalose is the major hemolymph sugar in insects and decapod crustaceans, with higher levels than glucose  <cit> . enzymes for trehalose synthesis were found in crustacean tissues, including gills  <cit> . trehalose and its fast transport into cells and consecutive transformation into glucose reflect its immediate availability to meet sudden bouts of energy demand. accordingly, a  <dig>  fold increase of trehalose concentration was measured in the hemolymph of c. maenas over 10 days under osmotic stress  <cit> . in h. araneus, however, the expression of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase was significantly down-regulated in all treatments  suggesting suppressed synthesis of the already depleted trehalose stores . significant up-regulation of transcripts encoding for glycogen phosphorylase  and alpha glucosidase  was found instead. both enzymes catalyse the glucose releasing steps of glycogenolysis indicating the use of glycogen as a glucose source during long-term increased demand.

enhanced demand for glucose is paralleled by a down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  in all treatments  indicating the potentially reduced production of nadph . g6pd is the key enzyme of the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, the main source of nadph for biosynthetic pathways in the cells . furthermore, the cytosolic  isocitrate dehydrogenase  was significantly down-regulated under intermediate co <dig> levels at high temperature , also suggesting lowered biosynthetic rates such as lipid biosynthesis under combined exposure .

oxidative stress
besides being involved in lipid biosynthesis, nadph is an important reducing agent in cellular antioxidative defence, e.g. by regenerating reduced glutathione, a major cellular antioxidant . thus, besides a general down-regulation of anabolic reactions it seems conceivable that h. araneus encounters a reduced capacity to counteract oxidative stress under hypercapnic and thermal stress.

significant changes in the expression of several genes involved in cellular antioxidant defence, including several peroxidases, indicate potential oxidative stress in h. araneus under intermediate co <dig> exposure . these changes in expression level were less pronounced under high co <dig> , suggesting a decreasing acclimation capacity of the h. araneus with increasing external pco <dig>  among up-regulated genes, especially genes associated with the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide  were affected under hypercapnia exposure. an ascorbate peroxidase  was significantly up-regulated under intermediate co <dig> concentrations . apx is a peroxidase that utilizes ascorbate as electron donor to detoxify h2o <dig> into water . additionally, a glutathione peroxidase  that reduces h2o <dig>  using glutathione as substrate, was up-regulated under high co <dig> exposure . this contrasts the down-regulation of two thiol-specific peroxiredoxin- <dig>  at intermediate co <dig> concentration , indicating a balanced response possibly by differential transcription of different splice variants. peroxiredoxins are ubiquitous enzymes detoxifying peroxides, such as h2o <dig>  by oxidising their active cysteine site using peroxide as substrate and are regenerated by oxidation of a thiol-containing electron donor, commonly thioredoxin  <cit> . however, only two sequences encoding for a thiol-containing protein  were significantly down-regulated .

the up-regulation of genes for anti-oxidants, such as glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxin, may indicate compensation for enhanced ros  production and concomitantly oxidative stress in the gill tissue of h. araneus under co <dig> exposure. this is further supported by a significant up-regulation of a ribosomal cytochrome p <dig> like gene in the intermediate co <dig> treatment . cytochrome p <dig> is involved in the oxidative metabolism of a variety of organic substrates and incomplete catalytic processes can result in a continuous release of ros  <cit> . in contrast, a transcript encoding for urate oxidase  was significantly down-regulated in all treatments  . uricase is commonly located in the peroxisomes of the hepatopancreas tissue, however, uricase activity has also been detected in gill tissue of the kuruma shrimp marsupenaeus japonicas
 <cit> . uricase catalyses the reaction from urate to allantoin and contributes to the generation of h2o <dig> by the oxidation of uric acid  <cit> . consequently, a down-regulation of uricase may contribute to alleviate the generation of ros. interestingly, co <dig> exposure also led to an increase in several vitellogenin like transcripts . although expression of vitellogenins is generally sex- and tissue-specific, the expression in both sexes of the mud shrimp upogebia major
 <cit> , revealed a positive effect on oxidative stress resistance regardless of the developmental stage. vitellogenin is also beneficial for oxidative stress resistance in honeybees, apis mellifera
 <cit> . even if the function of vitellogenin in oxidative stress resistance is far from being completely understood and further investigations are needed to validate this hypothesis, the strong up-regulation of vitellogenin under co <dig>  may indicate that vitellogenin is an important protein in the resistance to co2-induced oxidative stress .

hypercapnia induced enhancement of oxidative stress defence was recently demonstrated in the eastern oyster, crassostrea virginica
 <cit> . in a proteomic approach, an up-regulation of several proteins, e.g. superoxide dismutase and several peroxiredoxins, was detected after exposure to high pco <dig>  for 2 weeks. the authors suggested several ways of how increased co <dig> levels could directly or indirectly cause oxidative stress. on the one hand, a reaction of co <dig> with peroxynitrite, a ros formed through the reaction between superoxide anions and nitric oxide, resulting in the formation of reactive carbonate and nitrogen species, can lead to oxidative stress by oxidizing molecular compounds  <cit> . on the other hand, an indirect influence of elevated co <dig> and/or ph could adversely affect mitochondrial functions and/or the non-enzymatic production of ros  <cit> . however, our findings cannot support a direct influence of co <dig> on oxidative stress generation, as one would assume an increase in the response to oxidative stress with increasing seawater co <dig>  our data rather indicate an indirect influence of elevated co <dig> on ros production, likely by enhanced ros production due to metabolic stimulation. the suggested increase in oxidative metabolic processes might cause enhanced ros production and would also explain why the oxidative stress response was higher under intermediate co <dig> than in the high co <dig> treatment.

cell structure
it is well known that the formation of ros can damage lipids, proteins and dna e.g.  <cit> . a large group of genes that belong to the functional category ‘cytoskeleton’ include several actins and tubulins which are up-regulated together with the antioxidant genes under co <dig> exposure. the cytoskeleton is one major target for oxidative stress  when the exposed cysteine component of actin forms oxidized derivates, such as intermolecular disulfide bridges  <cit> . this presumably has adverse effects on the interaction between actin and actin binding proteins and leads to changes in the structure of the actin cytoskeleton. the up-regulation of two transcripts encoding for actin in both intermediate co <dig> treatments  and the high co <dig> treatment  may counter the damages caused by oxidative stress. an additional up-regulation of two actin binding proteins, nesprin and adducin, further supports the need for structural adaptation under oxidative stress triggered by co <dig> exposure . there is strong evidence that ros induce the expression of tubulin  <cit> , which could explain the up-regulation of β-tubulin and three transcript sequences encoding forα-tubulin in both intermediate co <dig> treatments  and the high co <dig>  treatment . although the effect of oxidative stress on the cytoskeleton is still poorly understood and needs further investigation, an interaction of oxidative stress and adaptive changes in the cytoskeleton is well recognized  <cit>  and supported by our findings.

besides enhanced antioxidative defence, a reorganisation of the cytoskeleton may occur in gill epithelia during the initial stage of hypercapnia acclimation. in c. maenas, a reorganisation of gill epithelia was observed after short-term exposure to very high pco <dig> , but not after medium-term exposure to high pco <dig>   <cit> . similarly, a reorganization of the cytoskeleton may not occur during medium-term co <dig> acclimation of h. araneus . the response of genes that belong to the functional category ‘cytoskeleton’ was higher at intermediate co <dig>  than at high co <dig> , in line with the findings in antioxidative defence. this also suggests that the changes observed result from oxidative stress via enhanced metabolic rate at intermediate co <dig> with the cytoskeleton as a direct target of ros formation.

cytoskeletal genes also responded to elevated temperature . several genes encoding for actin-binding proteins as well as membrane and cuticle proteins were significantly up-regulated . three transcripts of gelsolin, an actin-binding protein and regulator of actin filament assembly, were significantly up-regulated. the expression of an actin-binding nesprin, a membrane-binding ankyrin and an actin-related cytoskeletal structure protein spectrin was also increased. warming affects various cellular processes, including stability and/or dynamics of the cytoskeleton for review see  <cit> . an increase in cytoskeletal gene expression despite the general down-regulation of expression levels indicates a requirement for the stabilization of the cytoskeleton, possibly elicited by the warm-induced stimulation of metabolic rate and associated ros formation. interestingly, such up-regulation of cytoskeletal gene expression could not be seen in under combined intermediate pco <dig> and high temperature , suggesting that the general down-regulation induced by high co <dig> also affects cytoskeleton assembly.

commonly, stresses such as temperature extremes, cellular energy depletion, and extreme concentrations of ions, osmolytes and gases induce the synthesis of heat-shock proteins  for review see  <cit> . however, hsp expression levels being unchanged in the high temperature treatment  suggest that 10°c is not a temperature extreme for the arctic h. araneus population. in contrast, the expression of several hsps was up-regulated under co <dig> exposure . one hsp <dig> was up-regulated in both the intermediate and the high co <dig> treatments . four transcripts encoding for hsp <dig> were significantly up-regulated in the intermediate co <dig> treatment  and two in the intermediate co <dig> plus high temperature treatment . in treatments i, iii, and v one hsp <dig> showed decreased expression. acting as molecular chaperones, hsps can play an important role in maintaining proteins in a folded or unfolded state, controlling the unintended aggregation of proteins or target proteins for degradation  <cit> . their induced expression, especially under intermediate co <dig> concentrations, paired with increases in mrna transcripts for proteins involved in antioxidant defence suggest an increased capacity to defend the cell against cellular damage. the up-regulation specifically of hsp <dig> suggests hsp <dig> to be of particular importance in maintaining protein homeostasis.

CONCLUSIONS
based on a comprehensive expression analysis of genes related to acid–base regulation, metabolism, cell structure and their coupling to the stress response, this study has identified moderate, but distinct responses to ocean acidification in gills of adult h. araneus. we could demonstrate that the molecular response strongly depends on the co <dig> concentration. at pco <dig> values proposed for the end of the century, changes in expression suggest elevated metabolism caused by stimulated acid–base regulation and associated with increased oxidative stress. this up-regulation was attenuated at even higher pco <dig>  with expression levels closer to control values , indicating down-regulation of these processes. responses in transcripts related to acid–base regulation and energy metabolism were in line with those observed at elevated temperature. observations under hypercapnia in the blue mussel m. edulis are in line with these conclusions. an increase in aerobic metabolism under intermediate pco <dig> exposure  was followed by a decrease at higher pco2
 <cit> . in earlier studies on marine invertebrates, high pco <dig> exposure  induced a decrease in metabolic rates. in the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis and the decapod crab necora puber, a decrease in respiration rates was seen in response to long-term exposure at a pco <dig> of approx.  <dig>  and  <dig>  μatm, respectively  <cit> . our findings suggest a pco <dig> dependent threshold where metabolic stimulation might turn into metabolic depression. in h. araneus this threshold may be reached at a pco <dig> of approximately  <dig>  μatm. although further examinations besides transcriptomics covering a broader range of pco <dig> concentrations are certainly needed to confirm a possible threshold, a recent meta-analysis revealed that 50% of all marine crustacean species were negatively affected at this pco2

changes in the expression of genes related to energy metabolism paralleled the expression of those related to acid–base regulation and both paralleled the changes in extracellular ph , indicating a feedback regulation between ph and metabolic rate . in the marine worm s. nudus and the mussel m. galloprovincialis, metabolic depression under co <dig> was caused by a drop in phe
 <cit> . h. araneus was able to partially compensate for the acidosis via bicarbonate  accumulation, but capacities were not sufficient to fully compensate. at both experimental temperatures  hemolymph acidosis was compensated to the same extent. at high co <dig> concentrations, the capacity to fully compensate may be even more limited related to decreased ion transporter expression and activities. since acid–base regulation is an atp-consuming process, the decreased expression of metabolism related genes might at least in part be explained by a phe-triggered inhibition.

these shifts cause changes in energy balance which can therefore reflect the limits in stress tolerance  <cit> . a bioenergetic framework  <cit>  builds on the physiological concepts of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance   and the dynamic energy budget   <cit> . two cases distinguished between physiological responses to moderate and extreme environmental stress. moderate stress induces additional atp turnover along with a higher metabolic rate, in h. araneus exemplified in enhanced acid–base regulation and cellular damage repair from oxidative stress at intermediate pco <dig>  these mechanisms support long-term persistence at the expense of a shift in energy budget   <cit> . even if the enhanced energy demand of stress resistance can be met by increased feeding, it may still result in a reallocation of energy from fitness-related functions such as reproduction and growth to maintenance and damage repair  <cit> . more extreme stress exacerbates the disturbances in homeostasis, exemplified in stronger disturbances in acid–base status as seen in h. araneus favouring a suppression of metabolic rate  <cit>  which preserve energy resources and lessen the generation of detrimental metabolic by-products  <cit> . in h. araneus the respective response to high pco <dig> was paralleled by a lower expression of transcripts associated with energy metabolism, stress response and cellular organization. depressed metabolism would result in insufficient energy balance and time-limited tolerance to environmental stress making long-term survival impossible   <cit> .

to our knowledge, we report the first gene expression profiling study analysing the responses to a combination of two drivers in an osmoconforming crustacean. the study confirms the interdependence of physiological processes affected by elevated seawater pco <dig> and temperature. furthermore, the study demonstrates the importance of considering projected climate scenarios in experimental work, as responses to increasing seawater co <dig> concentrations are not necessarily linear, as presented here.
