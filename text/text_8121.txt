BACKGROUND
brachiaria is an important poaceae genus introduced in brazil from africa. this genus consists of around  <dig> species, and the two most important cultivars in brazil are b. brizantha cv. marandu and b. decumbens cv. basilisk  <cit> . they show qualities of forage grass, good adaptability to cerrado areas , and are cultivated in more than  <dig> million hectares in brazil  <cit> . both cultivars reproduce asexually through seeds by apomixis  <cit> , which is classified as a pseudogamous aposporic type  <cit> . apomixis is present in more than  <dig> angiosperm species  <cit>  and is being investigated by many groups due to the biotechnological interest of controlling the process of cloning through seeds.

the occurrence of both apomictic and sexual reproduction within brachiaria makes it an interesting system for understanding the molecular pathways involved in both modes of reproduction. the identification of genes involved in apomictic development will open the possibility of controlling the expression of this trait and engineering crops with higher productivity and a reduced risk of gene transfer. one way of comparing these different molecular pathways is by comparing the transcript expression profiles of genes related to ovary development in sexual plants, which have a polygonum-type embryo sac, to an apomictic plant, which has a panicum-type embryo sac  <cit> . analysis of a brachiaria germplasm collection assembled at ciat-colombia pointed to a majority of polyploids apomicts, whereas the diploids are sexual  <cit> . in b. brizantha among  <dig> accessions identified to date only one is diploid, bra  <dig>  <cit> . sexual tetraploids were obtained with colchicine treatment of the diploid plants  <cit> . these plants are under analysis at the breeding program aiming to produce intraspecific hybrids and to identify molecular markers associated with the apomixis trait. currently, comparative studies of the molecular biology of brachiaria reproductive processes are being performed with bra  <dig> and bra  <dig>  <cit> . both accessions are very important for these comparative studies since the sexual diploid bra  <dig> is the only sexual accession among all the accessions, while bra  <dig> is the most apomictic accession, with 98% of aposporous embryo sacs  <cit> .

quantitative real-time pcr  has emerged as an important technique to compare the expression profiles of target genes in different species, tissues or treatments and also to validate high-throughput gene expression profiles  <cit> . one of the methodologies to determine gene expression levels in qrt-pcr is by comparing the expression of the gene of interest in different conditions with reference genes whose expressions do not change under the various experimental conditions. based on these requirements, statistical analysis methods have been developed in order to identify the best reference genes to a certain organism or experimental condition  <cit> . the use of reference genes without prior verification of their expression stability can lead to inaccurate data interpretation and thus generate incorrect results.

according to previous work concerning the best reference genes for transcription normalization in plants, the most reliable ones are those constitutively expressed and involved in basic cellular processes, such as protein and sugar metabolism and cell structure  <cit> . a large-scale comparative analysis of the most stable genes of arabidopsis has shown that the best reference genes are those related to the ubiquitin degradation process, such as polyubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin ligases  <cit> . in the qrt-pcr expression profile analysis of suitable reference genes for poplar  and vitis , tubulin and actin were stably expressed and considered the most reliable ones  <cit> . in a similar approach, jain et al.  showed that the best genes among the different tested tissue samples in oryza sativa were ubiquitin  <dig> and elongation factor- <dig> alpha. for species with both sexual and apomictic reproductive mode, the best reference genes for qrt-pcr experiments have not been reported yet. real time pcr has been done to validate other differential expression experiments using absolute qrt-pcr or using internal control genes tested by other differential expression techniques  <cit> .

in this work, we evaluated eight potential reference genes isolated from est ovary libraries for brachiaria brizantha qrt-pcr experiments. vegetative and reproductive tissues of apomictic and sexual b. brizantha were tested. the relative transcription levels of the genes were determined in ovaries and anthers at different developmental stages, sporogenesis and gametogenesis, in spikelets, leaves and roots all together. also, it was determined the most stable genes only for spikelets and ovaries, where differences in the expression profile between sexual and apomictic plants must occur, from both sexual and apomictic accessions.

RESULTS
candidate reference genes
in order to pinpoint the best reference genes in brachiaria, known reference genes from other species were used to blast search against a brachiaria brizantha est  library constructed from ovaries of apomictic plants in megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis. this library was validated by sequencing and annotating  <dig>  clones, and out of these sequences, eight genes were chosen due to their high similarity to sequences related to commonly used reference genes, including polyubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, elongation factor- <dig> alpha, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and tubulin. specific primers were designed and tested for amplification efficiency, including two sets of primers for an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to use as an internal control .

*amplification efficiency was calculated using the miner algorithm  <cit>  and range from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .

primer efficiency and ct variation
in order to find the best reference genes for relative quantification, a high quality starting material is needed. for that, total rna was extracted from all tissue samples using the same extraction protocol  <cit>  for the different brachiaria organs. all samples were treated with dnase to avoid misinterpretation of qrt-pcr results by genomic dna contamination in cdna samples. rna quality analysis and quantitation were performed by agarose gel analysis and a nano-drop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer  measurement, respectively. this procedure was crucial to guaranteeing the same amount of starting material and equivalent efficiency of cdna synthesis from total rna samples.

based on dna analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis and the dissociation curves , one single pcr product with the expected size was amplified for each of the nine sets of primers selected for this analysis . after the pcr reaction, the entire raw fluorescence data generated in opticon <dig> was used for the primer amplification efficiency calculation and ct determination with the miner algorithm  <cit> . this algorithm accounts for each pcr exponential curve, making it is possible to have accurate values for the quantification of qrt-pcr. the amplification efficiency using this program can vary between 50% and 150%, and for the nine tested primer pairs it varied from  <dig>  ±  <dig>   to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , which are expected amplification efficiencies between compared genes  <cit> .

the median ct data in the  <dig> samples are shown in figure  <dig>  and the ct variations among the samples for the different primers are shown in figure  <dig>  the range and distribution of the ct values allow for a visualization of the least variable genes among the samples. this provides an indication of the most stable genes, which were ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes  and elongation factor- <dig> alpha , and showed the narrowest ct range and therefore the least deviation from the ct median by the different samples . the ct values of the candidate reference genes in all samples were within  <dig>  and  <dig>  cycles, showing a high range of variation between them. bbrizef <dig> showed the highest expression levels, whereas bbrizsucoa showed the lowest within the chosen set of samples. depending on the expression level of the genes tested, it is suitable to choose a reference gene with similar expression levels of the tested genes.

gene expression stability of candidate reference genes
we used the genorm application for selecting the best reference gene for brachiaria brizantha  <cit> . genorm calculates a gene stability value  and a normalization factor  based on the geometric mean of the expression values of the set of the control genes tested. the lower the m value, the more stably expressed the gene is. also, the program enables the exclusion of the most unstable gene to recalculate the m value. out of the eight genes used for analysis, only bbriztub showed an m value higher than the cutoff established by genorm , and two of them  showed the lowest m values, numbers well-suited for reference genes  <cit> . the primers used for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  and elongation factor- <dig> alpha  had m values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, when all of the genes for the calculation were considered . however, after exclusion of the least stable gene, bbriztub, there was a decrease in the m value of all the other genes and also a change in the m values of the unstable genes, bbrizgdp and bbrizubi . to check if the primer design might interfere in the stability value of gene expression and to have an internal control of genorm, a second pair of primers was used for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that amplified a more external region of the gene. the m value for both sets of primers was the same, showing that the amplification region had no influence on the expression stability. although the difference in the m value of the bbrizef <dig> gene was higher when compared with bbrizubce, it is recommended its inclusion as a reference gene in qrt-pcr because of its high expression values, which is important whenever the tested genes are highly expressed. to support these data, bestkeeper  <cit> , another excel-based tool based on pairwise correlation, was performed and showed similar results concerning the best reference genes for brachiaria . having at least two reference genes is suggested for a more accurate qrt-pcr analysis. a previous report concerning the reference genes for oryza sativa also showed that ubiquitin  <dig> and ef <dig> were the most stable genes for the tissues analyzed  <cit> . in addition, a recent work on vitis vinifera identified elongation factor- <dig> as one of the most stable genes for pre- and post-anthesis flowers, berries, leaves and roots  <cit> . in species that show both apomictic and sexual development, differential expression screening in immature spikelets have been held in order to find genes related to apomixis development. for eragrostis curvula it has been shown that, depending on the ploidy level and reproductive development of the plant, genes that are usually constitutive, such as ubiquitin and elongation factor can vary in expression level  <cit> . in addition, for paspalum notatum, another apomictic plant, among other genes, polyubiquitin and ribossomal protein showed different expression levels depending on the ploidy and reproductive development when comparing immature spikelets of apomictic vs sexual plants  <cit> . considering that in these two species the reproductive mode and ploidy level influence in expression levels of commonly used reference genes and if they will be used for apomixis molecular studies, stability in ovaries of sexual and apomictic plants is probably a relevant point to be considered. therefore, the m value for only spikelets and ovary tissues in the four developmental stages in both apomictic and sexual b. brizantha was calculated . bbrizubce and bbriztub were again the more stable and the least stable genes respectively, while there was a slight difference in the order of stability of the other genes. the second and third best reference genes were bbrize1f4a and bbrizef <dig> with a  <dig>  difference in m value.

the genorm application considers two different factors in order to analyze gene expression stability: the average expression stability  and the pairwise variation . the pairwise variation  is calculated based on normalization factor values after the stepwise addition of a least stable reference gene  and indicates the minimum number of reference genes necessary for an accurate normalization. when analyzing all eight of the genes with a pairwise variation, there was not a significant difference in the v numbers, but there was an increase in the instability with the addition of bbrizsucoa  and bbriztub , relatively unstable genes as shown by the ct distribution in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the optimal cutoff v number according to vandersompele  should be around  <dig> , but other works using this application have shown a higher v number for the studied species  <cit> , depending on the amount of genes and type of samples tested. in b. brizantha, the addition of a fourth gene did not have a significant contribution to stability, comparing all tissues. considering these values, we suggest that only two reference genes, bbrizubce and bbrizef <dig>  should be used for qrt-pcr experiments of root, leaf and reproductive tissues of the studied accessions. besides, analysis of ovaries alone should be performed preferentially with bbrizubce, bbrize1f <dig> and bbrize1f.

CONCLUSIONS
from the eight housekeeping genes tested in this study, the ones encoding for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  and elongation factor- <dig>  were considered most stable based on the transcriptional profile and genorm analysis when considering both vegetative and reproductive tissues.

these two genes have been suggested as reference genes in other plants for qrt-pcr analysis, but also for other experimental techniques such as rt-pcr and northern blot analysis  <cit> . even though the two genes exhibited the desired stability values, the best experimental designs use reference genes that act independently and are involved in different cellular processes. therefore, bbrizubce and bbrizef <dig> will be used as the reference genes in further experiments of b. brizantha vegetative and reproductive developmental tissues. this is the first report to clone, sequence and test reference genes for the transcriptional analysis of plants of the brachiaria genus. our results provide crucial information for transcriptional analysis in the brachiaria ssp, helping to improve the quality of gene expression data in these species, which constitute an excellent plant system for the study of apomixis.
