BACKGROUND
during development, distinct cell phenotype differentiation is guided by finely tuned and orchestrated changes in transcriptional activity of specific groups of genes that become gradually activated , gradually repressed , or whose activity does not change substantially . ultimately, analyzing the transcriptome of a cell type offers an opportunity to broadly identify transcripts that define it. in addition to these either developmentally regulated or artificially induced phenotype changes that are accompanied by distinct transcriptional changes, a transcriptome of any given cell type can vary substantially depending on cell cycle  <cit> , passage number, and environmental factors such as oxygen concentration  <cit> , temperature, and presence of serum  <cit> .

another important factor that causes transcriptional changes and is crucial for maintaining a cell phenotype is growth substrate. for example, maintenance of undifferentiated state of embryonic stem cells is dependent on favorable substrate, composed of laminin  <cit> , vitronectin  <cit> , fibronectin  <cit> , and collagen iv  <cit> . in addition to chemical composition, physical properties of substrate also determine cell fate. roughness and stiffness of the surfaces have also been shown to affect developmental plasticity of cells. smooth and rigid glass surface supports undifferentiated phenotype, while rough and soft substrates promote differentiation  <cit> .

lastly, presence of various growth factors in culture media can have a significant effect on a cell transcriptional activity and consequently its phenotype. fgf <dig> is a mesenchyme-derived growth factor that displays mitogenic, migratory, and morphogenic functions and is also known to play role in angiogenesis, organ development, organ regeneration, and wound healing  <cit> . contrary to its predominantly mitogenic effects on differentiated cell types, fgf <dig> is absolutely required for maintenance of expression of stemness-related genes. with respect to wound healing, fgf <dig> has been studied as a potential therapeutic anti-scarring agent  <cit> .

we have previously investigated the effects of the aforementioned important cell culture conditions, fgf <dig> and culture surface, on adult human fibroblasts. we have observed that adult human fibroblasts demonstrated fgf2- and surface-mediated induction of some endogenous stem cell genes and a capacity to acquire a more developmentally plastic phenotype. this low level of activation of stem cell genes was not sufficient for induction of a phenotypic conversion into a pluripotent cell phenotype  <cit> . however, when transplanted into skeletal muscle injury, adult human fibroblasts grown in low oxygen and with supplementation of fgf <dig> had the capacity to tip the healing outcome of skeletal muscle injury – by favoring regeneration response in vivo over scar formation  <cit> . the wound repair process consists of several phases, including immediate response to injury, inflammatory response, cell proliferation and migration, ecm contraction, and ecm remodeling. the roles of dermal fibroblasts in wound healing have been described  <cit>  and in mammals fibroblasts facilitate collagen deposition and formation of a scar. the cascade of molecular events leading to scar formation involves increased proliferation and migration of fibroblasts in response to growth factors  <cit> , production and organization of specific ecm components  <cit> , and acquisition of an actin-dependent contractile phenotype  <cit> . the wound repair process is complete by formation of a scar   <cit> .

in this study, we compared transcriptomes of control fibroblasts and regeneration- competent fibroblasts to determine whether transcriptional profile that characterizes regeneration-competent cells reflects disregulation of genes involved in the default wound healing pathway leading to scar formation – turning the cells into a more pro-regenerative phenotype.

RESULTS
the effect of cell growth surface and fgf <dig> on fibroblast transcriptome
to obtain a sense of the effects of surface and fgf <dig> treatment on global transcription, two independent samples  of human dermal fibroblasts grown on glass, glass with fgf <dig>  plastic, and plastic with fgf <dig> were hybridized to the human whole genome onearray® microarray, which contains  <dig>  human oligonucleotide probes. background-corrected intensity data was normalized and filtered, which identified  <dig>  probes of detectable level of intensity . the gene expression dataset is of excellent quality as indicated by pearson’s correlation coefficients for biological replicates:  <dig>  for glass,  <dig>  for glass with fgf <dig>   <dig>  for plastic, and  <dig>  for plastic with fgf <dig> . to investigate cell culture effects, we examined significantly differentially expressed gene probes using moderated t-statistic and based on the false discovery rate  cutoff value of  <dig> . comparison of transcriptomes between cells grown on glass and plastic in the absence of fgf <dig> did not identify any differentially expressed genes. however, fgf2-induced changes in gene expression depended on surface.

fgf <dig> had a more prominent effect on cells when grown on plastic than on glass, as determined by the overall increased number of differentially expressed gene probes  . in response to fgf <dig> treatment,  <dig>  differentially expressed gene probes  were identified that were disregulated on both surfaces:  <dig>  common gene probes were upregulated   and  <dig> common gene probes downregulated  . in addition to these common genes, fgf <dig> treatment disregulated  <dig> unique gene probes  on glass and  <dig>  unique gene probes  on plastic . the complete list of differentially expressed gene probes on glass and on plastic can be found in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  respectively. the top  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes are represented in the heat maps . all further analyses were performed on genes whose expression was disregulated in cells grown in the presence of fgf <dig> on plastic.

gene ontology analysis
differentially expressed genes were analyzed for functional enrichment. to determine the functions of the genes affected by fgf <dig> treatment and consequently identify the cellular processes that are affected by these transcriptional changes, we performed gene ontology  analysis. first, all significantly differentially expressed genes were analyzed to determine broad go term overrepresentation using go slim analysis. go slim analysis identified broad terms describing biological processes , molecular functions , as well as cellular components to which they belong . additional file  <dig> includes the number of gene probes representing each go slim term. a total of  <dig> overrepresented go terms  associated with biological processes were identified. these included genes involved in regulation of cell cycle, cardiovascular system development, extracellular matrix organization, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, regulation of angiogenesis, cell migration, and wound healing. seventy seven overrepresented go terms  were associated with molecular function. the genes belonged to extracellular matrix structural constituents, genes regulating collagen, heparin, integrin binding, and genes regulating cytokine activity. sixty five overrepresented go terms  were associated with cellular components and belonged primarily to extracellular components .

expression of genes associated with wound healing
as fgf2-treated human dermal fibroblasts were previously shown to participate in wound healing of volumetric skeletal muscle by contributing directly to the pool of satellite pax <dig> positive cells and by stimulating regeneration of endogenous skeletal muscle tissue  <cit> , we focused further analysis of differentially expressed genes to those that play a role in wound healing and could be uniquely identifying regeneration-competent fibroblasts.

overall, select genes belonging to extracellular matrix and its remodeling, inflammation, cytoskeleton and migration, and growth factor signaling were found to be affected by fgf <dig> 

extracellular matrix, matrix remodeling enzymes, and adhesion molecules
fgf <dig> treatment led to downregulation of most collagens  and fibronectin  and to upregulation of several laminins . fgf <dig> increased expression of select metallopeptidases , and metallopeptidase inhibitor timp <dig>  among downregulated genes were timp <dig>  and several other adamts proteinases . different members of integrin family responded by significant upregulation  or downregulation . significantly disregulated genes identified by the microarray are presented in table  <dig>  expression levels of select target genes identified by the microarray  were examined by qrt-pcr .

cytoskeleton
another group of genes found to be regulated by fgf <dig> treatment were components of the cytoskeleton that are also involved in wound healing . the most significant effect was observed on actc <dig> and actg <dig>  expression levels of actc <dig> and actg <dig> identified by the microarray  were examined by qrt-pcr .

cytokines, their receptors, and downstream signaling molecules
cytokines that were identified to be differentially expressed are listed in table  <dig>  fgf2-induced transcriptional increase was observed in genes associated with inflammation , and growth factor signaling . expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1b  and il <dig> decreased upon fgf <dig> treatment. signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , which is a known downstream target of il <dig> signaling, was downregulated as well as was another downstream il6/stat <dig> gene, cc chemokine ligand ccl <dig>  expression levels of all these targets identified by the microarray  were confirmed by qrt-pcr . fgf <dig> effect on expression of tgfb pathway genes included increase in tgfbr <dig> expression, decrease in tgfbr <dig>  and decrease in tgfbi . tgfb <dig> and tgfb <dig> were not significantly differentially expressed due to fgf <dig> treatment. qrt-pcr results for tgfb <dig> and tgfbr <dig> are presented in figure 5b.

discussion
the comparative transcriptome analysis described here demonstrates a unique molecular signature for induced regeneration-competent  fibroblasts compared with control fibroblasts. consistent with the notion that these two cell types are distinctly different, we have used both cell types in in vivo regeneration experiments and demonstrated that the induced regeneration-competent fibroblasts participate in regenerative response of skeletal muscle , contribute to the pool of newly established satellite cells  in a mouse injury model, as well as form mature myotubes  <cit> .

identification of significantly differentially expressed genes and subsequent gene ontology analysis determined that a large number of genes important for the outcome of wound healing such as extracellular matrix genes, adhesion molecules, matrix remodeling genes, and genes involved in inflammation were regulated by fgf <dig> .

during dermal wound healing, fibroblasts are responsible for ecm production  <cit>  and, here, we show that fgf <dig> treatment affects a number of genes involved in production and remodeling of ecm. fgf <dig> caused downregulation of a number of collagens such as collagen iv, collagen xi, collagen v, and collagen i, as well as caused upregulation of collagen xxi and collagen xiv . qrt-pcr analysis confirmed downregulation of col1a <dig>  col4a <dig>  col4a <dig>  col4a <dig>  col8a <dig>  and col11a <dig> . fgf <dig> was previously shown to downregulate expression of interstitial collagen i and iii  <cit> . collagen i is a major component of ecm in skin, and during wound healing is the main scar forming collagen. collagen iv is a major constituent of basement membrane  and is a predominant type of collagen found in skeletal muscle. other ecm genes affected by fgf <dig> treatment included laminins and fibronectins . most profoundly affected by fgf <dig> treatment were laminin gamma  <dig>  and laminin alpha  <dig> . qrt-pcr confirmed increased expression levels of these two laminins . fibronectin  <dig> was downregulated by fgf <dig> treatment . fgf <dig> treatment of human fibroblasts modulates production of the ecm. the ecm composition of the fgf2-treated fibroblasts favors the pro-regenerative outcome in the wound site directly by affecting the balance between scar formation and tissue regeneration and potentially thorough changes in cell attachment to ecm, cell migration, and cell proliferation.

cell attachment to the ecm is regulated through integrins, heterodimers that recognize specific substrates. adhesion and migration on collagen substrate is performed through α1β <dig> and α2β <dig> and formation of collagen type i and type iii network is dependent on fibronectin and α2β <dig>  <cit> . we show fgf2-induced upregulation of β <dig> and α <dig> . integrins α5β <dig>  αvβ <dig>  and α4β <dig> pairs are utilized to bind fibronectin matrix  <cit> , αvβ <dig> is used to adhere to vitronectin, and α6β <dig>  α2β <dig>  α3β <dig> to adhere to laminin and entactin  <cit> . fgf <dig> treatment downregulated itgb <dig> and upregulated itgb <dig> and itga <dig> . integrins connect ecm to actin cytoskeleton via focal adhesions rich in talin, which is recruited to f-actin, and binds integrin pairs, which in turn leads to transmission of f-actin movements to ecm  <cit> . change in the composition of integrins, as well as in the components of focal adhesions leads to change in migration, as well as preferential binding to specific substrate, production of which is regulated by fgf <dig> treatment, and may benefit a pro-regenerative response.

during wound healing, fibroblasts acquire a highly migratory phenotype. the process is driven by actin polymerization and resulting microfilaments of the cell’s leading edge link to ecm via integrins. actomyosin contraction then allows for the disassembly of adhesions in the rear and movement forward  <cit> . thus, movement of the fibroblasts in the wound site is regulated not only by the ecm and adhesion molecules, but also by the actin cytoskeleton. actin cytoskeleton is also involved in fibroblast contractile phenotype. during dermis healing, fibroblasts generate stress fibers  to enable contraction  <cit> . fibroblasts’ shape is regulated by the environment and cell-matrix adhesion determines the cell shape, such as strong cell-ecm adhesion promotes spindle-shaped fibroblast  <cit> . in vitro fibroblasts were shown to have different morphology depending on the substrate they are grown on; in 3d cultures resembling an in vivo environment, fibroblasts display elongated shape, well-developed actin cortex, and filopodia at the leading edge  <cit> . alpha actin actc <dig>  which is a constituent of the contractile apparatus, was downregulated in human dermal fibroblasts treated with fgf <dig> . gamma actin actg <dig>  which is involved in cellular motility and adhesion, was 64-fold downregulated , though qrt-pcr did not confirm its expression. by regulating cytoskeleton gene expression, fgf <dig> potentially promotes cell migration in the wound site, and reduces contraction that leads to the favorable pro-regenerative outcome.

previously, it was shown that administration of fgf <dig> alone into a dermal wound shows reduced scar formation  <cit> , which can be attributed to upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase mmp <dig>  <cit> . our data shows strong upregulation of mmp <dig> , the metalloproteinase responsible for cleaving collagen type i, ii, and iii  <cit> . fgf <dig> signaling was shown to activate the mmp <dig> promoter  <cit> . mmp <dig> was able to improve the skeletal muscle regeneration process by reducing scar tissue formation  <cit>  and by promoting migration of myoblasts involved in regeneration of skeletal muscle  <cit> . interestingly, integrin α2β <dig> was shown to increase mmp <dig> expression  <cit> . by transplanting fgf <dig> treated human dermal fibroblasts, continuous increase in production of mmp <dig> among other factors, may be allowed, indicating that mmp <dig> is present not only at the time of the resolution phase of wound healing leading to decreased collagen production, but also at earlier stages of wound healing, for example during the inflammation stage. other mmp molecules, such as stromelysins mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  were upregulated as well . mmp <dig> was previously shown to be responsible for contraction of fibroblasts during wound healing  <cit>  and was regulated by fgf <dig> in a mouse model  <cit> . mmps, mostly mmp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are highly upregulated during amphibian limb regeneration  <cit> . all of these observations point toward a favorable role of mmps in the regeneration process. thus, fgf2-stimulated change in transcriptional profile of various mmps is an important factor contributing to the regeneration-competence of fibroblasts.

fgf <dig> treatment also led to a favorable ratio between mmps and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases , as an imbalance between mmps and timps has been shown to increase scar formation. fgf <dig> upregulated timp <dig> and downregulated timp <dig> expression . adam and adamts proteinases that were shown to be differentially regulated by fgf <dig>  are regulators of ecm and adhesion molecules and affect cell motility, adhesion, and signaling during wound healing processes. adamts <dig> and adamts <dig> were downregulated by fgf <dig> treatment . adam transmembrane proteinases are involved in cleaving and activating various cell surface molecules, whereas adamts are secreted proteinases that can bind ecm. admats <dig> that was upregulated by fgf <dig> treatment  has anti-angiogenic properties  <cit> .

the ratio of tgfb1/tgfb <dig> is a factor that predicts scar formation, the decrease in this ratio being indicative of reduced scar formation  <cit> . fetal wounds that are known to heal without scar formation exhibit decreased tgfb <dig> levels  <cit> . administration of tgfb <dig> has also been shown to reduce scar formation  <cit> . tgfb pathway was previously shown to be induced by fgf <dig> treatment in mouse embryonic fibroblasts   <cit> . we observed no change in the levels of tgfb <dig> due to fgf <dig> treatment by microarray analysis whereas qrt-pcr showed downregulation of tgfb <dig> levels . we observed upregulation of tgfbr <dig> due to fgf <dig> treatment by the array, but qrt-pcr showed no change in expression levels . qrt-pcr confirmed downregulation of tgfbr <dig> . these observations may be due to differences between mouse embryonic fibroblasts and adult human dermal fibroblasts, indicating that fgf <dig> response in these cells may be unique.

decreasing inflammation has been shown to decrease scar formation. for example, when wounds of skin and oral mucosa were compared, there was less inflammation and scarring in oral mucosa  <cit> . non-scar wound healing in fetal wounds is also characterized by absence of inflammation  <cit> . inflammatory events are integrated by chemokines. chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that regulate migration of cells during inflammatory process. elr cxc chemokines are neutrophil attractants and activators. cxcl <dig> or granulocyte chemotactic protein- <dig>  is a elr cxc chemokine. fgf <dig> treatment led to increase in cxcl <dig> chemokine expression . cxcl <dig>  a chemokine that attracts and activates neutrophils, amplifies inflammatory cascade, and stimulates local production of cytokines was shown to be upregulated by fgf <dig> treatment . interestingly, when cxcl <dig> is cleaved by mmp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  increased inflammation is observed and cell recruitment to the wound site is activated  <cit> . ccl <dig> , which is involved in inflammatory cell recruitment, can be induced through focal adhesion kinase  leading to inflammation and scar production in a cutaneous injury, and ccl <dig> knock-out mice showed decreased scarring  <cit> . here, we observed downregulation of ccl <dig> due to fgf <dig> treatment . in agreement with previous publications, implantation of fgf <dig> treated fibroblasts, which show ccl <dig> downregulation, into a mouse wound sight leads to reduced scar formation  <cit> . we also show in this transcriptome analysis that il6/stat <dig> signaling pathway is regulated by fgf <dig> . interleukin  <dig>  is a pleiotropic cytokine that is produced by a variety of cells such as epidermal cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts  <cit> . il <dig> is known to increase production of collagen  <cit> , thus the decrease in collagen synthesis that we observe in skeletal muscle injury, can be partially explained by decrease in il <dig>  ccl <dig> was shown to induce il <dig> secretion in human lung fibroblasts, and has a role in regulating fibrosis  <cit>  and was shown previously to be regulated by fgf <dig>  <cit> . scarless, fetal wounds are characterized by diminished expression of pro-inflammatory il <dig> and il <dig>  <cit> . here, we show that fgf <dig> treatment significantly reduces il <dig> levels , whereas levels of il <dig> are upregulated with fgf <dig> treatment . fgf2-induced decrease in il <dig> level could be contributing to pro-regenerative phenotype of adult human fibroblasts. signal transducer and activator of transcription  conveys signals from il <dig>  loss of il <dig> was shown to result in deficiency of proliferation and migration of myoblasts  <cit> . il6/stat <dig> was shown recently to be involved in excessive ecm production and increased cellular proliferation in hypertrophic scars compared to normal human fibroblasts  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
comparison of transcriptomes between control and regeneration-competent fibroblasts indicates significant differences in expression of genes involved in several biological processes during wound healing. downregulation of collagens, upregulation of ecm remodeling enzymes, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines may be in part responsible for the cells’ pro-regenerative phenotype. a choice between scar-forming and pro-regenerative wound healing responses may depend on a balance between ecm production, degradation, consequent ecm contractility, and decreased inflammatory response. further studies are needed to elucidate functional significance of specific disregulated genes.
