BACKGROUND
in recent years, microspheres, liposomes, and biodegradable polymers have been used in site-specific drug delivery systems  <cit> . hydrophilic-hydrophobic diblock copolymers exhibit amphiphilic behavior and form micelles with core-shell architecture. the hydrophobic block forms the inner core, which acts as a drug incorporation site, especially for the hydrophobic drugs. the hydrophilic block forms the hydrated outer shell, which plays a role in preventing uptake by the reticuloendothelial system   <cit> . the predominant characteristics of these copolymers that have been reported include solubilization of hydrophobic drugs, sustained release, selective targeting, and lower interactions with the res  <cit> . nanoparticles made from poly  and poly  are hydrophilic-hydrophobic diblock copolymers which have these predominant characteristics  <cit> . thus, this peg-pblg copolymeric carrier may serve as an appropriate vehicle for drug delivery  <cit> .

the anticancer activity of camptothecin  and its natural and synthetic analogs has been shown in a broad spectrum of cancers, including leukemias and cancers of the liver, stomach, breast, and colon  <cit> . among natural cpts, 10-hydroxycamptothecin  has been shown to be more active and less toxic  <cit> ; however, natural hcpt is in a lactone form and is water-insoluble. one way to improve the solubility of hcpt is to change the lactone form to the carboxylate form by adding naoh. however, this leads to less activity and more unwanted toxicity  <cit> . at the same time, hcpt has a short half-life in vivo and poor biodistribution  <cit> .

to improve the solubility of cpt analogs, the lactone form of the analogs was incorporated into liposomes or nanoparticles  <cit> . these delivery systems show favorable pharmacokinetics and biodistribution  <cit> . in the present study, we prepared hcpt-loaded peg-pblg nanoparticles and investigated the in vitro release, pharmacokinetics, and anticancer effect. our results showed that hcpt-loaded nanoparticles changed the pharmacokinetic behavior of hcpt in vivo. the hcpt-loaded nanoparticles had a more sustained release, a longer circulation time, increased delivery to tissue, and an enhanced anticancer effect.

RESULTS
characteristics of hcpt-loaded nanoparticles
in this study, hcpt-loaded pblg/peg nanoparticles were prepared using dialysis. after analysis by uv spectrophotometey, we found that the solution of hcpt in a standard sample, or the simple mixture of a solution of hcpt and pblg/peg, had high absorbency in the wavelength range,  <dig> –  <dig> nm . however, the absorbency of the solution of hcpt-loaded pblg/peg nanoparticles was greatly decreased , representing the formation of hcpt-loaded peg-pblg nanoparticles. on the basis of absorbency at  <dig> nm, the drug-loading capacity and drug encapsulation of hcpt-loaded nanoparticles were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively.

the morphology of hcpt-loaded nanoparticles  was found to be a core-shell structure that was spherical or elliptical, with a smooth surface. the hydrophobic central core, the grayish area inside the bright white ring, was approximately  <dig> nm in diameter. the hydrophilic shell, the bright white ring, was approximately  <dig> nm in thickness.

abrupt-sustained release of hcpt-loaded nanoparticles
the standard curve of a hcpt solution was derived from the following equation: y =  <dig>  x +  <dig>  . hcpt release from peg-pblg nanoparticles at phs  <dig>  and  <dig>  in vitro is shown on fig.  <dig>  the hcpt release profile was biphasic, with an initial abrupt release, followed by sustained release. abrupt release occurred at  <dig> h, and 1/ <dig> of the loaded hcpt was released by that time. then, the release of hcpt entered sustained release following initial abrupt release. after  <dig> h, 3/ <dig> of the loaded hcpt was still enveloped in the nanoparticles. in this release study, hcpt-loaded nanoparticles showed a quicker release pattern in the more alkaline condition.

pharmacokinetic characteristics of hcpt-loaded nanoparticles
the standard curve for hcpt in rabbit plasma was derived from the following equation: y =  <dig>  x + <dig>  , where y is the concentration  and x is the peak height. the limit of determination was  <dig> μg/l. the mean plasma concentrations over time for the free hcpt and the hcpt-loaded nanoparticles are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the hcpt release profile from hcpt-loaded nanoparticles was biphasic with an initial abrupt release, followed by sustained release. abrupt release occurred at  <dig> h and the peak concentration was  <dig>  μg/l. during the sustained release, the plasma concentration was between  <dig>  –  <dig>  μg/l. as shown in table  <dig>  the pharmacokinetics of hcpt changed after it was loaded into peg-pblg nanoparticles. the terminal elimination half-life was longer, the peak concentration decreased, and the apparent volume of distribution increased.

tumor inhibition effect of hcpt-loaded nanoparticles in vivo
tumor-associated swellings were visible in all the mice. as demonstrated by the tumor growth curve of lovo  and tca <dig> cell xenografts , xenograft growth was fast in the blank and peg-pblg control groups, but significantly depressed in the hcpt- or hcpt/peg-pblg-treated groups. as shown in table  <dig>  tumor doubling time lengthened with treatment. the inhibition rate for hcpt alone was between  <dig> and 70%, but was greater than 80% for the hcpt-loaded nanoparticles. the tumor volumes of the hcpt and hcpt-loaded nanoparticle-treated groups were significantly less than those of the blank and peg-pblg control groups . there was also significantly more tumor inhibition in the hcpt-loaded nanoparticle treated group than in the hcpt treated group . however, there was no significant difference in tumor inhibition between the two control groups . no significant toxicity was observed in any of the groups.

discussion
drug-loaded nanoparticles made from natural and synthetic macromolecular materials that are biocompatible and biodegradable have been used for controlling the release of drugs and changing pharmacokinetics and the targets of drug action  <cit> . nanoparticles have been used to load anticancer drugs to enhance their anticancer effect and decrease their toxicity  <cit> , especially for water-insoluble drugs. nanoparticles made from peg and pblg, which are biocompatible and biodegradable macromolecule materials, have been used to load drugs  <cit> . in this study, hcpt-loaded peg-pblg nanoparticles were prepared by dialysis, and the drug loading capacity was  <dig> %, which was obviously higher than that of hcpt-loaded polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles  prepared by the adsorption-enwrapping method  <cit> .

like many other copolymer nanoparticles  <cit> , the shape of hcpt-loaded nanoparticles was mostly spherical or ellipsoid. close observation of sem photographs revealed grayish and bright white profiles in the copolymer nanoparticles, which indicated that they are of the core shell type. the grayish center portion, which was  <dig> nm in diameter, was assigned to the core of the hydrophobic pblg, and the bright white ring, which was  <dig> nm in thickness, was assigned to the shell of the hydrophilic peg. studies have revealed that nanoparticles are not easily phagocytized by phagocytes when the thickness of the peg layer is  <dig> nm for every  <dig> nm thickness of micelles  <cit> . thus, the size of the nanoparticles was suitable to avoid uptake by the res.

numerous data have shown that the release of drugs from nanoparticles is biphasic, with abrupt and sustained release components  <cit> . abrupt release includes release of the drug adsorbed at the surface of the nanoparticles or diffused from the polymer matrix. abrupt release enables the drug to quickly reach effective blood concentrations. sustained release is the release of the drug that was enwrapped inside the nanoparticles and occurs when the nanoparticles biodegrade, or diffuse from the polymer matrix. sustained release is advantageous to maintain effective blood concentrations of the drug. in this study, the release profile of the hcpt-loaded nanoparticles also consisted of an abrupt release and a sustained release. the hcpt-loaded nanoparticles also showed a quick release pattern in the alkaline condition in vitro. this may be related to the fact that the lactone form of hcpt converts to the carboxylate form in the alkaline condition and becomes water-soluble.

hcpt is an inhibitor of topoisomerase i . other researchers have revealed that only the lactone form of hcpt can form a stable compound with topo i and dna, which may be responsible for its anticancer effect  <cit> . the carboxylate form of hcpt has a low anticancer effect, high toxicity, and poor stability. previous pharmacokinetic studies with hcpt have indicated that hcpt has a short half-life, a poor affinity for tissue, and a higher combination rate with plasma protein  <cit> . in this study, we found the same results. therefore, to improve the anticancer effect and decrease the toxicity of hcpt, many researchers have investigated a new preparation of hcpt  <cit> . williams et al.  <cit>  prepared sn-38-  loaded phospholipid-peg nanoparticles by the solvent-evaporation method, which enhanced the lactone ring stability in the presence of human serum albumin and prolonged the existence of the active drug  and the half-life in vivo. hcpt-loaded nanoparticles prepared by zhang  <cit>  were targeted to the liver and had a sustained release effect. in our study, the pharmacokinetic parameters of hcpt changed after it was enveloped in the peg-pblg nanoparticles. compared with hcpt, the pharmacokinetic parameters for the hcpt/peg-pblg nanoparticles had the following changes: 1) the terminal elimination half-life increased, 2) the peak concentration decreased, and 3) the apparent volume of distribution increased. these results indicate that the hcpt-loaded nanoparticles have the following characteristics: 1) sustained release, 2) prolonged half-life, and 3) increased affinity to tissue. therefore, they have the properties of an ideal new preparation of hcpt. the studies of li et al.  <cit>  and jeong et al.  <cit>  have also shown that 5-fluorouracil- or adriamycin-loaded peg-pblg nanoparticles have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics.

hcpt has known clinical efficacy against a variety of solid tumors in humans  <cit> . in this study, free hcpt inhibited the xenograft growths of colon cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma, and prolonged the tumor doubling times. these findings were also demonstrated in our previous studies  <cit> . compared with free hcpt, hcpt-loaded nanoparticles had a higher inhibitory effect on colon cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma. williams et al.  <cit>  reported a similar result; after treatment with sn-38-loaded phospholipd-peg, the anticancer effect against ht- <dig> colon xenografts was higher compared to cpt- <dig>  the higher anticancer effect of hcpt-loaded nanoparticles may be due to one or more of the following reasons. first, the hcpt-loaded nanoparticles have sustained release, a prolonged half-life, and increase the apparent volume of distribution. these characteristics may increase the exposure time of the drug to tumor tissues. second, the hcpt-loaded nanoparticles stabilize the lactone form of hcpt, which inhibits the activity of topo i. the longer the period of stabilization, the stronger the anticancer effect. third, tumor tissue has an abundant blood supply and tumor cells exhibit higher phagocytotic ability. together, these characteristics would make nanoparticles more likely to enter the tumor cells and would improve the anticancer effect.

CONCLUSIONS
from this research, we found that peg-pblg nanoparticles are useful for the solubilization and sustained release of hcpt. hcpt-loaded peg-pblg nanoparticles improved the tissue-specific delivery and the anticancer effect of hcpt by changing the pharmacokinetic behavior of hcpt in vivo.
