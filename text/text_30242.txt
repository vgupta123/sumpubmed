BACKGROUND
identification of pathogen-associated molecules, such as dsrna and lipopolysaccharide , by host pattern recognition receptors  is a critical step in innate immune response . stimulation of tlrs  by a pathogen induces activation of signal transduction cascades, which leads to translocation of nuclear factor-κb  to the nucleus  <cit> , activation of interferon regulatory factors 3/ <dig>  and/or activator protein- <dig> , which cooperate to induce transcription of various cytokines such as alpha/beta interferon  to counteract infection  <cit> . in this paper we analyze crosstalk between the two major signaling pathways in the iir system, namely the nf-κb and irf pathways. the regulatory mechanisms of activation of these two pathways and their interactions during the iir are only partially known. recent work by the brasier’s group and others has shown that irf3-dependent and nf-κb-dependent pathways are interconnected at multiple steps, with the final shared component being the iκb kinase-γ  subunit  <cit> . single-cell imaging experiments have provided information about cellular heterogeneity of these interactions but exact molecular mechanisms are not clear yet  <cit> . in the canonical model, ifn regulation, after rna virus infection, is conducted by irf- <dig> and irf- <dig>  an explanation was presented by covert et al.  <cit>  who proposed that the activation of nf-κb by trif-dependent pathway is a result of a secondary response to tnfα, which is induced by irf <dig>  and signals through the tnfα receptor /rip <dig> pathway to activate nf-κb. knowledge about the crosstalk between nf-κb and irf pathways may be crucial for determining the outcome of viral infection. most irf family members are expressed only in specialized cell types, but irf- <dig> is widely expressed  <cit> , stimulating synthesis of ifnβ in infected cells. because of this extensive presence, irf- <dig> function is widely targeted by viruses  <cit> , and thus its activity has to be aided by irf- <dig> which takes a major part in amplification of the antiviral response. research on nf-κb-deficient cells has shown that the initial kinetics of the type i interferon  response depends on concurrent nf-κb activation  <cit> . experimental data show that in the absence of nf-κb, the rapid ifnβ expression is blunted, reducing the propagation of anti-viral signals in the mucosal surface  <cit> . nf-κb also controls expression of the downstream ifn auto-amplification loop through stat <dig>  irf- <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig> transcription factors.

taking these findings into consideration it seems logical, that activity of iir depends on cooperation of both arms of this system and indicate that nf-κb and irf <dig> signaling pathways are highly interconnected and that these interconnections influence the kinetics of the iir  <cit> .

in this paper we examine evidence for a direct crosstalk of the nf-κb and irf <dig> signaling pathways at the lowest level, between main transcription factors and genes coding for these transcription factors. based on experimental data we believe that cross-talk at this level may strongly impact cross-regulation at higher levels. we analyzed respective gene promoters’ sequences using in silico methods for identification of transcription binding sites, mainly in the nf-κb- and irf-coding genes. we cross-reference these in silico results with publicly available chip-seq data and additional support based on the experimental results from our previous work  <cit> . our results extend the results obtained by brasier’s group.

RESULTS
interaction between irf <dig> and nf-κb pathways
using computational methods and cross-species comparisons among human, chimpanzee, mouse and cattle, we analyzed promoters of genes encoding factors involved in irf and nf-κb pathways. in the first step of analysis we were looking for hypothetical transcription factor binding sites  across given promoter region and in the second step we verified if these tfbs were conserved among species in the conserved domains. similar method of transcription factor binding sites analysis was used in iwanaszko et al.  <cit> . promoters of downstream genes, mainly coding for transcription factors involved, contain one or more binding sites for irf and/or nf-κb; partial results are presented in table  <dig>  detailed results of analysis of binding to the promoters of the transcription factor genes are presented in additional file  <dig>  similar results have been observed for other important genes regulated by nf-κb. the promoter of ifn-β contains nf-κb binding sites and two ifn-stimulated responsive elements  recognized by phosphorylated irf3/ <dig> . previous studies showed that the activity of cooperating regulatory proteins recruited to dna binding transcription factors play an important role in regulation of gene expression  <cit> . it was already demonstrated  <cit>  that activation of the ip <dig> but not mcp- <dig> promoter, both of which contain nf-κb binding sites differing in one and two nucleotides, requires irf <dig> as a co-activator following lps stimulation. this suggests that the binding site sequence composition has an influence on the type of cooperative proteins that are recruited to complex with the nf-κb dimer. formerly it was also shown that the glucocorticoid receptors can selectively trans-repress the transcription of a subset of genes , with promoters which use irf <dig> as an essential co-activator of nf-κb binding upon lps stimulation  <cit> . this indicates that binding sites arrangement and possible co-activators/co-repressors are critical for gene expression and thus this knowledge grants a deeper insight into the irf and nf-κb cross-regulation. it is known that tfbs found using computational methods may be non-functional, and therefore we cross-referenced our results with publicly available chip-seq data for irf <dig>  irf <dig> and nf-κb.table  <dig>

summary of the counts of tfbs corresponding to the members of irf and nf-κb families of transcription factors found in the promoters of presented genes in four species: human, mouse chimpanzee and cattle. motifs overlap; numbers in bold correspond to promoters containing  <dig> or more irf <dig> motifs. detailed results are presented in additional file  <dig>  *var – other variants of the promoter exist.



irf family
in the irf <dig> gene, we can distinguish  <dig> variants of promoters in the human and mouse genomes. in humans two of these variants have a single binding site for irf <dig> and irf <dig>  and at the same time have a higher number of nf-κb tfbss . two variants of promoters are placed on the negative strand, adjacent to the part covering 1st and 2nd intron and adjacent exons of gene bcl2l <dig>  in the human-chimpanzee comparison, one irf tfbs is conserved. there are no irf binding sites conserved in human-mouse or human –cattle comparisons.

in the irf <dig> gene there are no conserved binding sites for irf but a good conservation of nf-κb binding sites was detected. interestingly, human irf <dig> gene has the highest count of tfbs for p <dig> and p <dig> subunit in the dataset. analysis of single promoter sequences shows that the irf <dig> gene has binding sites only for the irf <dig> and none for the other irf family members. this may be an example of autoregulation feedback aided by other transcription agents, such as sp <dig> and ap- <dig> or even by members of the nf-κb family.

in irf <dig> there is no conservation between human and chimpanzee, but there is a good conservation of tfbs for human-mouse and human-cow comparison . analyzing activity of the irf family members on their coding genes suggests that regulation is connected with irf <dig> activity, based on the number and type of tfbs in promoter region of irf coding genes, while irf <dig> does not take any direct part in regulation of irf genes. another conclusion is that regulation of the irf genes appears to be more sensitive to the direct nf-κb binding than to the irfs binding, yet unknown transcription factors could be involved. this conclusion is based on the number of tfbs that have been found in the promoters of genes from both transcription factor families.

nf-κb family
on the human nfkb <dig> gene promoter, we have found  <dig> tfbs for the irf family members: one overlapping site for irf1/irf <dig> and second overlapping binding site for the irf1/nf-κb family. in chimpanzee we have found  <dig> tfbs for irf family members, two of them were overlapping irf1/irf <dig> binding sites. only one irf1/irf <dig> site is conserved between human and chimpanzee, there is no conservation with cattle  or mouse .

for the nfkb <dig> promoter, we did not find any irf family tfbss in all species, apart from  <dig> weak binding site for the irf <dig> in  <dig> of  <dig> promoter variants in mouse, overlapping stronger the nf-κb family binding sites.

for the rela gene, a single irf <dig> tfbs was found in the human promoter, however there is no tfbs for irf <dig> or irf <dig>  no irf binding sites were found in the cattle rela gene, but  <dig> tfbs was found in chimpanzee, and two in the mouse rela gene. none of those were evolutionarily conserved.

there is one irf <dig> tfbs in the rel gene, but high number of tfbs for the nf-κb family members. high number of irf <dig> tfbs was found only in cattle promoter , and none for irf <dig> 

in the nfkbia  promoter, we have found binding sites primarily for irf1:  <dig> in humans,  <dig> in cattle,  <dig> in mouse and one in chimpanzee. in human and mouse one of irf <dig> tfbs overlaps with weaker irf <dig> binding motif. nfkbia gene promoter contains a high number of nf-κb family binding sites, which are not adjacent to the sparsely distributed irf binding sites.

analysis of the promoter region in the nfkbie  gene showed similarly moderate counts of the irf and nf-κb tfbs, with strong overlapping irf1/irf2/irf <dig> sites in human, chimpanzee and cattle. in the mouse gene we have found only one binding site for irf <dig>  only this gene shows higher than usual count of irf <dig> binding sites.

analysis of 3’utr region
in previous research  <cit>  irf <dig> gene was grouped as one of the nf-κb-dependent genes, and according to dynamics of gene expression, as an “early” gene. at the promoter sequence level it can be clearly seen in our data, based on the number of tfbs for nf-κb family. taking this into consideration we adopted approach presented in iwanaszko et al.  <cit>  to analyze the 3’utr regions of the irf coding genes, in order to look for possible sequence characteristics similar to those of the nf-κb transcription factor coding genes. analysis of the 3’utr regions of human irf coding genes shows, that the irf <dig> 3’utr is the longest one with more than 2000 bp and contains one motif of the are class ii,  <dig> motifs of the are class i and  <dig> sequences categorized as the are class iii, with at-content around 50%. this is consistent with characteristics of the early nf-κb-dependent genes.

irf <dig> 3’utr region is in the 1000 bp range with  <dig> sequences categorized as are class iii and only one are i, with at content around 60%.

the 3’utr sequence for irf <dig> is strikingly different from other two, with only 89 bp length and  <dig> % at content, and no are elements present. this may suggest that the irf <dig> transcript is very stable. taking into consideration the promoter and 3’utr characteristics it is possible that irf <dig> and irf <dig> are also highly responsive to the nf-κb activity.

possible cofactors
when we analyzed the promoters of the genes coding for irfs and the nf-κb subunits we observed presence of the binding sites for the two other transcription factors, which may take part in the crosstalk between the irf and nf-κb pathways. one of these transcription factors is ap- <dig> , which is active in the tlr signaling pathways and is needed for ifnβ activation  <cit> , and the second one is the sp <dig>  which is reported to act with nf-κb <dig> subunit in antiviral immune response  <cit> .

based on tfbs search it seems that ap- <dig> and sp <dig> may be regulated by each other. we did not find binding sites for the irf family members in the ap- <dig> promoter region except for one irf <dig> site. expression of ap- <dig> seems to be co-regulated by the nf-κb family members, having binding sites for rel , rela  and nfkb <dig> . regulation of the sp <dig> expression seems to be independent of direct irf binding, but may be triggered by the nf-κb. we found  <dig> theoretical binding sites for the rel subunit, and one for nf-κb <dig>  which is confirmed to be functional  <cit> . sp <dig> was believed to bind sites in gc-rich regions and act as universal activator of housekeeping genes  <cit> , however reports implicate, that sp <dig> is responsive to intracellular signals. in our dataset gc-content fluctuates around 60%; only the promoters of nfkb <dig> and nfkbia genes have less than 55% of gc bases. it is interesting that the irf genes have rather high gc content in our ranking , but do not have the highest count of the sp <dig> binding sites. it seems that the rela and relb genes may be the most the sp1-responsive targets; details are presented in table  <dig>  to analyze the specificity of presence of ap- <dig> and sp <dig> binding sites, we generated a set of  <dig> random 1 kb sequences, which were analyzed in the same way, as our primary dataset. we compared the average count of tfbss belonging to ap- <dig> and sp <dig> in both datasets, and summary results show that ap- <dig> seems to be less dataset-specific than sp <dig> , and thus we propose sp <dig> as a stronger candidate for a co-factor in the nf-κb/ irf <dig> crosstalk.table  <dig>

validation of in silico findings
in order to increase support for the computationally found binding sites, we performed cross-species comparison and indicated promoter binding regions that were conserved. additionally we analyzed publicly available chip-seq data, to compare in silico binding sites with experimental results. we analyzed nf-κb chip-seq experiments in  <dig> cell lines, in one cell line for irf <dig>  and in  <dig> cell lines for irf <dig>  all available under the encode project  <cit> . detailed data on cell lines are presented in methods section. there is only one cell line, gm <dig> from blood tissue, in which activity of both transcription factors, nf-κb and irf <dig>  was analyzed and can be compared. in general, data for nf-κb are consistent among all cell lines considered, and peaks and a strong signal are present in the same regions as those determined computationally, in almost all analyzed cell lines. in case of irf <dig> data, the agreement depends on cell line. in particular in hepg cells nearly no binding signal was found for our set of genes. in the promoter of nfkb <dig> gene very strong and broad peak was found in all cell lines, with the strongest peak centered near tss  which is consistent across all experiments, and a few smaller peaks which are placed in further parts of promoter region. in summary, the computationally found tfbs are located in the experimentally confirmed binding region. binding region in the proximity of tss is also conserved in the species analyzed. in the case of irf <dig> binding, we observe a weak binding signal between 450b and 1000b upstream from tss, what is also consistent with our in silico findings. in the dataset for irf <dig>  a weak binding signal is present across the promoter region and a stronger broad peak is overlapping with the nf-κb binding region in the proximity of tss. our computational data found irf <dig> tfbs further upstream in the promoter region, but none near tss.

in the promoter of the nfkb <dig> gene again we see consistent binding across all cell lines used for nf-κb binding analysis. shorter gene variants have  <dig> strong peaks in their promoter region , these regions agree with location of computationally found tfbs for nf-κb family. this binding region overlaps with the strong peak for irf <dig> binding, and in these variants we found only one tfbs. in the longer variant our computational analysis shows no tfbs, and chip-seq data show binding peak in the region of the first exon of nfkb <dig>  but nearly no signal in the promoter region. there is no binding signal for irf <dig> in the promoter region of any variant of this gene which is consistent with lack of computationally found tfbs.

in the rela gene promoter, a strong binding signal for nf-κb is present in  <dig> out of  <dig> cell lines,  <dig> of which are defined peaks and are mostly consistent with the binding sites computationally located in the region further upstream from tss. there is also a strong binding signal in irf <dig> chip-seq data, in all  <dig> cell lines, which is centered next to the nf-κb binding peaks, and overlapping with even stronger peaks for irf <dig>  based on our in silico data we did not find binding sites for irf <dig> in this region, which is rather well conserved in the analyzed species, with the best conservation between human and cattle in  <dig> out of  <dig> human variants, and the worst conservation between chimpanzee and other species .

for the rel gene we see peaks in the promoter region in all analyzed nf-κb chip-seq data, with strong signal near the tss and in the  upstream region. these regions are overlapped with the strong signal from irf <dig> chip-seq data, and a negligible signal from one of the irf <dig> chip-seq experiments. binding sites in the region close to the tss are conserved among considered species.

in the promoter region of the irf <dig> gene, nf-κb binding sites are well represented by a strong peak near tss site and by a weaker one in the region  upstream of tss. this is consistent across all cell lines used for nf-κb binding identification and also consistent with our computational data. this region is overlapped by a strong peak signal from irf <dig> data and a weak signal from one cell line in irf <dig> experiments . again we find conserved nf-κb binding sites in the region close to tss site. for one longer human variant there is only a strong signal from irf <dig> binding.

in the irf <dig> gene, chip-seq data show peaks in  <dig> out of  <dig> nf-κb cell lines; the peaks are centered on the beginning of the first exon and the tss site. lower-strength signal is present across the whole promoter region. we found conserved binding sites for nf-κb in the region covered by the chip-seq data peak, with conservation across promoter region for human, mouse and cattle of around 61%, while chimpanzee sequence has average similarity of 34% with respect to other species. chip-seq data for irf <dig> show strong and broad peaks across the whole promoter range and one weak peak for irf <dig> in only  <dig> out of  <dig> cell lines, which is consistent with our in silico findings, and suggests a stronger responsiveness to irf <dig> 

irf <dig> gene promoter shows a moderate response to nf-κb in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases, located in the region  upstream of tss. strong peak for irf <dig> is located in the same region as the signal for nf-κb binding, overlapping the region of weak signal for irf <dig>  according to our computational results a strong binding site for irf <dig> is present, and binding site for irf <dig> is located in the region of low irf <dig> binding signal.

taking into consideration data for all promoters and comparing them with our computational predictions, we conclude that our in silico approach has some merit. computationally found binding sites are predominantly located in regions of experimentally proven bindings and these regions are also considerably well conserved among analyzed species.

CONCLUSIONS
our cross-regulation hypothesis, based on in silico methods is supported by experimental results. gene knockdown experiments  <cit>  show that levels of rela are increased by irf <dig> sirna silencing, suggesting that irf <dig> may be a negative regulator of rela expression. in addition, silencing rela resulted in upregulation of the irf <dig> expression levels. similar results were observed for known nf-κb-dependent genes, such as il <dig> or ikba, expression levels of which were upregulated in response to irf <dig> silencing. we show these interactions in figure  <dig>  which is a proposed conceptual diagram describing interactions between nf-κb and irf <dig> pathways at gene promoter level. presence of interactions between respective transcription factors is based on in silico tfbs data with chip-seq support as discussed earlier on in the paper, while direction of this interaction is based on literature  or concluded from experimental data   <cit> . crosstalk between the two arms of the iir system, at the level of interactions between genes coding for nf-κb and irf <dig> transcription factors and these transcription factors, was not presented before. the results are also consistent with the findings of wang et al.  <cit> , who show that overexpression of irf <dig> in hepatocytes results in ikkβ/nf-κb signaling downregulation  <cit> .figure  <dig> cross-signaling schematic. signaling pathways activated by viral by-products and involving potential targets for irf <dig>  nf-κb and sp <dig> . green arrows: confirmed positive regulation. red lines with bullet endings: confirmed negative regulation. blue dashed arrows: co-regulation of unknown type inferred from bioinformatics and evolutionary analysis. bold lines: strong association of tf based on high counts of binding sites in target gene promoters.



our results show that binding sites for members of the irf and nf-κb families do not overlap with each other but tend to be are alternately arranged. the best represented member of the irf family was irf <dig>  in most cases only singular irf <dig> tfbs were found, usually overlapping the better scored irf <dig> binding sites. compared to the number of the nf-κb binding sites found in the promoter region of genes encoding the members of nf-κb and irf family, the irf binding sites are relatively poorly represented. however, location of these few irf binding sites appears crucial and interrupts proper binding of other  transcription factors. based on the analysis of tfbs in promoters, the crosstalk between nf-κb and irf <dig> pathway is likely biased toward the activity of nf-κb. it was reported that activation of the nf-κb dependent genes occurs with no delays after nf-κb enters the nucleus, whereas irf <dig> enters nucleus before nf-κb, but its nuclear translocation profile suggests presence of additional modifying factors, which delay irf3-mediated activation  <cit> . we conclude that members of the irf family may not have a strong direct impact on the regulation of genes encoding the members of the nf-κb family, but rather act indirectly via other transcription factors. this cross regulation may be aided by two other transcription factors, which are distinguished by high counts of their tfbs in our dataset: ap- <dig>  which targets the irf <dig> gene as well as the rel, rela, relb genes, and potentially sp <dig>  which targets all tf-coding genes in our dataset, and also targets ap- <dig>  sp <dig> is known to regulate expression of genes involved in apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and viral immune response  <cit> . to obtain a better insight into the relationship between analyzed factors we also examined the promoter regions of the genes encoding the sp <dig> and ap- <dig> factors. this analysis shows the presence of crosstalk between irf <dig>  ap- <dig>  sp <dig> and members of nf-κb family. these findings are consistent with the results from chip-seq data analysis presented in yang et al.  <cit> , where ap <dig> and sp <dig> are spatially oriented relative to the location of the nf-κb family motifs, which suggest that they physically interact. furthermore observed co-occurrence correlates with different chromatin context  <cit> .

it is also known that irf1-mediated activation of il <dig> needs cooperation with the sp <dig> binding elements  <cit> . taking these data into consideration we present established and hypothetical interdependences in figure  <dig>  based on our in silico analysis we conclude that sp <dig> is among the best candidates for the unknown cofactor mediating the crosstalk between the irf and nf-κb pathways. we present extended crosstalk diagram of the irf - nf-κb pathways. this work is an extension and a full report of data supporting iir model in bertolusso et al.  <cit> , but it is focused on transcriptional regulatory dependencies as well as the role of cofactors sp <dig> and ap- <dig> in the cross-talk between nf-κb and irf.
