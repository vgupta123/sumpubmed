BACKGROUND
the wobble versatility hypothesis  <cit> , abbreviated as wvh, states that the wobble site of trna anticodon should have g for nny codons  because g can pair with both c and u in rna, and should have u for nnr to pair with both a and g. for nnn codon families, the wobble site should be u because u is known to be the most versatile in wobble-pairing  <cit> . in contrast, the codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis, or caah for short, invokes the codon usage bias as a determining factor, i.e., the wobble site of trna anticodon should co-evolve with codon usage so that the nucleotide in the wobble site of trna anticodon should match the most abundant codon in a synonymous codon family  <cit> . the association between the major codon and the anticodon of the most abundant trna has been documented in escherichia coli  <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , and other species and organelles  <cit> .

here we develop a general hypothesis of codon-anticodon adaptation based on an analysis of wobble costs, and derive its predictions that can be tested by genomic data. the wobble cost may be viewed as reduction in decoding efficiency and accuracy because such reduction would be selected against over evolutionary time. we will refer to this new general hypothesis based on wobble cost as wch . the two traditional hypotheses, caah and wvh, will be shown to be special forms of wch.

following the shorthand notation of ogle et al.  <cit> , i designate the translation cost through wobble base-pairing between nucleotide i at the third codon position of a codon and the nucleotide j at the wobble site of trna anticodon as mi3:j . we assume mi3:j =  <dig> if nucleotides i and j form watson-crick base pairing. the reason for this assumption is that c:g and a:u pairs have not been found to contribute to ribosomal stalling  or amino acid mis-incorporation  although almost all non-watson-crick base pairings have been shown to reduce translation efficiency and accuracy. we define my3:u as the wobble cost between a wobble u at the trna anticodon and a c or u at the third codon position. for simplicity, we also assume ma3:a = mc3:a = mg3:a = ma3:c = mc3:c = mu3:c = ma3:g = mg3:g = mo . in general, mu3:g and mg3:u are expected to be smaller than mc3:u, mu3:u, and mo because g and u can base-pair in rna, my3:u is expected to be smaller than mo because a wobble u at trna anticodon is known to be the most versatile in wobble-pairing  <cit> .

a classical study of u:g wobble pairs  <cit>  suggests a preference for the u being at the 3' end rather than at the 5' end, which implies that u3:g wobble pair is energetically more favorable than g3:u wobble pair  <cit> . subsequent studies have shown that, while the u3:g wobble pair occurs on the ribosome, the unmodified g3:u wobble pair does not  <cit> . these findings suggest that mu3:g may be smaller than mg3:u, although its generality is unknown.

two-fold nny and nnr codon families
first consider the nny codon family where y is either c or u. designate the number of c-ending and u-ending synonymous codons by nc and nu, respectively, and the total cost of wobble pairing as mwg when the wobble site of the anticodon is g, and as mwa when the wobble nucleotide is a . we now express the total cost mwg and mwa as

  mwg=numu3:gmwa=ncmc3:a=ncmo 

note that mc3:g = mu3:a =  <dig> according to our definition. the dependence of mwg and mwa on the relative frequencies of nc, expressed as proportion of c-ending codons in the nny codon family , is graphically shown in fig.  <dig>  with mo assumed to equal 2•;mu3:g. the condition for mwg = mwa, i.e., when the wobble site of the trna anticodon can take either g or a without a fitness differential, is

  mu3:gmo=ncnu=pc1−pc 

in the scenario in fig.  <dig> with mo = 2mu3:g, the condition for mwg = mwa is pc = 1/ <dig>  thus, when pc drifts above 1/ <dig>  it would become more beneficial  to have a g at the wobble nucleotide of trna anticodon. however, when pc drifts below 1/ <dig>  then a wobble a would be more advantageous and should be favored by natural selection. naturally, if mu3:g =  <dig>  then we should always have a wobble g at the trna anticodon regardless of codon usage.

now we consider three special cases with reference to fig.  <dig> and the two traditional hypotheses, caah and wvh. first, if nc = nu = n/ <dig>  then caah, which predicts that the wobble nucleotide of trna anticodon should form watson-crick base pair with the most abundant codon, has no prediction at all because the two codons are equally abundant. in contrast, if we assume mu3:g < mo as is depicted in fig.  <dig>  we have mwg < mwa, and wch predicts that the anticodon wobble site should be a g. this is the same prediction as wvh.

second, if nc > nu, then mwg < mwa assuming mu3:g ≤ mo, and wch predicts that the anticodon wobble site should be occupied by a g. this prediction is shared by both caah and wvh.

third, when nc < nu but nc > nu·mu3:g/mo, then wch will still predict a g at the wobble nucleotide of trna anticodon because mwg is still smaller than mwa. take the scenario in fig.  <dig> for example, when nc < nu but pc > 1/ <dig> , we have mwg < mwa , so natural selection should favor a g at the wobble site of trna anticodon. wvh happens to have the same prediction. however, caah will predict an a at the wobble site of trna anticodon if u-ending codons are more abundant than c-ending codons. this is in contrast to wvh, i.e. caah is inapplicable when pc is within the shaded range in fig.  <dig> 

fourth, when nc << nu, especially in the extreme case when nc =  <dig>  then eq.  is reduced to mwg = nu• mu3:g and mwa =  <dig>  because now mwg > mwa, wch predicts an a at the anticodon wobble site. in this case, wvh would still predict a g at the wobble site because it ignores the codon frequencies , but caah would predict an a at the wobble site, which is the same prediction as wch. only in this particular case when nc << nu can caah and wvh be clearly differentiated. as is depicted in fig.  <dig>  the chance for caah to be supported decreases as mu3:g decreases relative to mo. caah would have little chance to be unambiguously supported if mu3:g is close to  <dig>  thus, as long as mu3:g is small relative to mo, we should expect caah to be less supported than wvh. a recent study shows that caah indeed receives much less support than wvh when both were tested against fungal mitochondrial genomic data  <cit> .

the simple eq.  offers a way to assess relative costs of different wobble pairs. for example, if nature has chosen a g at the wobble site of the trna anticodon, then we may infer that mwg < mwa. so, from eq. , we have

  numu3:g<ncmomu3:gmo<ncnu 

suppose we have an nny codon family translated by a trna with a g at the wobble site of the anticodon. if mu3:g is large, then there would be strong selection favoring c-ending codons against u ending codons. so the ratio of nc/nu may be very large. in such a case the estimated mu3:g/mo ratio, being smaller than a very large value, is not informative. however, in different codon families, mutation pressure may allow nu to drift up relative to nc. suppose we have three nny codon families each translated by a trna with a g at the anticodon wobble site. if the nc/nu ratio for the three nny codon families are 100/ <dig>  80/ <dig> and 200/ <dig>  respectively, we may infer that mu3:g/mo < 80/ <dig> . alternatively, with many nc/nu ratios from many nny codon families translated by trna with a g at its anticodon wobble site, we may compute the lower 95% confidence limit of the nc/nu ratio  and infer that mu3:g/mc3:a < lcl <dig> g.

if we always have very large nc/nu ratios, we may infer that selection against u-ending codons must be strong, with little chance for mutation to elevate nu. this is a strong indication of a large mu3:g. along the same line of reasoning, we may infer that mu3:g is very small if nu can often as large as, or even larger than, nc.

similarly, if nature has chosen an a at the wobble site of trna anticodon, then we may infer mwg > mwa, so

  numu3:g>ncmomu3:gmo>ncnu 

we can apply exactly the same rationale for the nnr codon family leading to parallel conclusions. for example, if nature has chosen a u at the wobble site of the trna anticodon, then we may infer that mwu < mwc, so that

  mg3:umo<nang 

similarly, if mg3:u is very large, then there should be strong selection against g-ending codons in favor of a-ending codons. this will produce large na/ng ratios. in contrast, a large ng comparable to na indicates a very small mg3:u cost.

given previous studies indicating that u3:g is energetically much more favorable than g3:u  <cit> , we should expect mu3:g < mg3:u. the reasoning above paves the way for us to test whether this is generally true among the genetically diverse fungal species.

three-fold auh  codons
designate codons ending with a, c, and u as na, nc and nu, respectively. the wobble cost of having an a, g, c, or u at the wobble site of trna anticodon is

  mwa=nama3:a+ncmc3:a=momwg=nama3:g+numu3:g=namo+numu3:gmwc=nama3:c+ncmc3:c+numu3:c=mo+numu3:cmwu=ncmc3:u+numu3:u=my3:u 

it is obvious that mwc is always greater than mwa, so we should never find a c at the wobble site of a trnaile anticodon, i.e., we can disregard mwc. if nature has chosen g at the wobble site of trnaile anticodon, then we may infer that mwg is the smallest. from mwg < mwa and mwg < mwu, we have

  mu3:gmo<ncnunumu3:g<mx3:u−namomu3:gmy3:u<nc+nu−nanu,assuming my3:u<mo 

where the assumption is made on the basis of previous observations that u is generally the most versatile in wobble-pairing among the four nucleotides  <cit> .

four-fold nnn codons
designate the number of codons ending with a, c, g, and u as na, nc, ng, and nu, respectively. the wobble costs involving an a, c, g or u at the wobble site of trna anticodon are, respectively,

  mwa=nama3:a+ncmc3:a+ngmg3:a=momwc=nama3:c+ncmc3:c+numu3:c=mo+numu3:cmwg=nama3:g+ngmg3:g+numu3:g=mo+numu3:gmwu=ncmc3:u+ngmg3:u+numu3:u=my3:u+ngmg3:u 

if nature has chosen a u at the wobble site of the trna anticodon, then eq.  does not give us any simple inequality to estimate the cost ratios. however, if nature has chosen an a at the wobble site of the trna anticodon, then from mwa < mwg and mwa < mwc, we can infer

  mu3:gmo>ncnumu3:cmo>ngnu 

in what follows, we estimate mu3:g/mo, mg3:u/mo, and mu3:c/mo by using fungal mitochondrial genomic data. cells in fungal species are generally rapid-replicating which necessitates efficient translation. rapidly replicating unicellular organisms are theoretically expected to be under strong selection to increase the rate of biosynthesis  <cit>  and they typically exhibit strong codon-anticodon adaptation  <cit> . thus, fungal species should be ideal for evaluating evolutionary hypothesis on codon-anticodon adaptation.

methods
we retrieved  <dig> fungal mitochondrial genomes  by using ncbi entrez. three different genetic codes are used in different fungal genomes. among the  <dig> fungal mitochondrial genomes, seven genomes use translation table  <dig>   <dig> genomes use translation table  <dig>  and two genomes use translation table  <dig> . when results are similar among genomes using the same translation table, only results from a representative genome are presented. the number of codon families supporting caah  and wvh  is compiled following the following rationale  <cit> . suppose a lysine  codon family has  <dig> aaa and  <dig> aag codons. wvh would ignore the codon usage bias and predict a wobble u in the trnalys anticodon because u can pair with both a and g, whereas caah would predict a wobble c in the trnalys anticodon to maximize the watson-crick match with the more frequent g-ending codons. if the trnalys anticodon is found to have a wobble u, then wvh is supported; if a wobble c is found, then caah is supported. if we have  <dig> aaa codons and  <dig> aag codons and if trnalys anticodon has a wobble u, then both hypotheses are supported, i.e., they are indistinguishable and are not included in table  <dig>  the methionine codon families are not included in table  <dig> but discussed in detail elsewhere  <cit> .

† genetic code.

the trna and cds sequences were extracted and analyzed by using dambe  <cit> . the cds-derived codon usage is also computed with dambe. the anticodon in almost all trna sequences from all species share the regular feature of being flanked by two nucleotides on either side to form a loop that is held together by a stem. for example, the anticodon loop  of the trnaarg genes translating cgn codons in epidermophyton floccosum is 28cguguuacggccacg <dig>  where the starting and ending numbers indicate the position of the ac loop in the trna sequence, with the anticodon 5'-acg-3'  flanked by two nucleotides on either side  to form a loop that is held together by a stem made of the first and the last four nucleotides. similarly, the other trnaarg translating agr codons is 25aaaauacuucuaauauuuu <dig>  with the ac loop held together by a six-base stem. however, some trna sequences have a suspicious ac loop and dambe will flag them out. the ac loop is then identified by aligning the trna sequences against other isoaccepting trna sequences with a regular ac loop  <cit> . some trna anticodon loop has the anticodon flanked by three instead of two nucleotides. for example, the anticodon loop in trnaleu in the mitochondrial genome of kluyveromyces thermotolerans is gauacucuuaagauguauu, with the anticodon uaa flanked by three nucleotides  on both sides. there are a few trna sequences in which anticodon loop cannot be identified.

some mitochondrial genomes in genbank are annotated incorrectly. for example, trnapro in the mitochondrial genome of ashbya gossypii atcc  <dig> has an anticodon of ugg matching codon cca , but the genbank file  annotated the anticodon to match codon ccu.

a few fungal mitochondrial genomes do not have a complete set of trna genes. for example, the mitochondrial genomes of hyaloraphidium curvatum and harpochytrium sp. jel <dig> have seven and eight trna genes, respectively, and consequently will need trna import from the nuclear genome. this may cause complication in analyzing codon-anticodon adaptation. however, removing such genomes does not alter the conclusions.

some species exhibit extreme avoidance of certain codon families. for example, ashbya gossypii atcc  <dig> codes arg with only agr codons without using any cgn codons. in contrast, hyaloraphidium curvatum codes arg with only cgn codons without using any agr codons. such avoidance of certain codon families would facilitate the evolutionary loss of the associated trna  <cit> , although it is not always clear whether the avoidance is the cause or the consequence of the loss of the associated trna.

we computed relative synonymous codon usage, or rscu  <cit> , as a measure of codon usage bias within a codon family by using dambe  <cit> . some coding sequences are incomplete. for example, the cox <dig> cds in aspergillus niger is annotated as "join". the first two nucleotides  represent a partial codon and are discarded in computing codon frequencies.

RESULTS
wobble cost between g and u: mu3:g and mg3:u
recall that the two inequalities

  mu3:gmo<ncnu andmg3:umo<nang 

are, respectively, for nny codons translated by trna with a g at the wobble site of trna anticodon, and for nnr codons translated by trna with a u at the wobble site of trna anticodon. the observed nc/nu ratios for allomyces macrogynus  are much smaller than na/ng ratios . the smallest nc/nu value is  <dig>  whereas the smallest na/ng value is  <dig>  . we have mentioned before that, if mu3:g is very small, then a wobble g at the trna anticodon will not impose strong selection against u-ending codons, and nu may drift up and down with mutation relative to nc. this will lead to relatively small nc/nu ratios. from the minimum nc/nu value of  <dig> , we may infer that mu3:g <  <dig> •mo, i.e., mu3:g is quite small relative to mo.

§ ncod: number of codons in the codon family

the auh codon family coding for amino acid ile in a. macrogynus mitochondrial genome is translated by a trna with a gau anticodon. according to eq. , the mu3:g/co ratio should also be smaller than the nc/nu ratio. the observed nc/nu ratio is  <dig>  . this is similar to the nc/nu ratio in nny codon families . thus, the wobble cost of mu3:g relative to mo from the auh codon family is similar to that derived from nny codon families.

the cun codon family coding for amino acid leu in a. macrogynus mitochondrial genome is translated by a trna with an aag anticodon. note that no a→i conversion has been observed in mitochondria  <cit>  so eq.  is applicable. according to eq. , the mu3:g/co ratio should be greater than the nc/nu ratio. the observed nc/nu ratio is  <dig>  . thus we have mu3:g >  <dig> •mo. this inequality, together with the previous inequality of mu3:g <  <dig> •mo, leads to  <dig> •mo < mu3:g <  <dig> •mo.

given that mu3:g >  <dig> •mo, we can infer that mwg > mwa when nc/nu <  <dig> , i.e., when u-ending codons are more than five times as frequent as c-ending codons. in other words, when nc/nu <  <dig> , the wobble cost of having an a at the wobble site of the trna anticodon is smaller than that of having a g at the wobble site, and should be favored by natural selection. among the  <dig> fungal mitochondrial genomes, only two genomes have a nny codon family with a correspondent trna that has an a at the wobble site of its anticodon. in the mitochondrial genome of penicillium marneffei, the trna translating the aay codon family has a wobble a in its anticodon. the nc/nu ratio is  <dig>   which is much smaller than  <dig> . similarly, in the mitochondrial genome of pichia canadensis, the trna translating the agy codon family has a wobble a in its anticodon. the nc/nu ratio is  <dig>   which is also much smaller than  <dig> . thus, the prediction that a wobble a at the trna anticodon is advantageous over a wobble g when nc/nu <  <dig>  is consistent with empirical data.

in contrast to the small nc/nu ratios in nny, auh and cun codon families, all na/ng ratios in nnr codon families are substantially larger . we have argued before that, if mg3:u is very small, then a u at the wobble site of trna anticodon would impose little selection against g-ending codons in nnr codon families, and mutation may allow ng to drift up, leading to large ng values relative to na. however, if mg3:u is large, then g-ending codons should be strongly selected against and ng would be small relative to na, leading to large na/ng ratios. the much larger na/ng ratios than nc/nu ratios  suggest that mg3:u is much greater than mu3:g.

there is a caveat in evaluating the relative magnitude of mu3:g/mo, and mg3:u/mo by the nc/nu and na/ng ratios because these ratios can be affected by at-biased mutations. the mitochondrial genome of a. macrogynus is  <dig> bp, with the number of c+g being  <dig> and that of a+u being  <dig>  if we exclude those nucleotides in coding sequences, then the numbers of c+g and a+u are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. this may be considered as the background frequencies maintained by mutation bias, which leads to the expected nc/nu ratio of  <dig>   and that of na/ng ratio of  <dig>  . thus, we expect nc/nu to be smaller than na/ng even when there is no difference between mu3:g and mg3:u. to establish the argument that mu3:g is indeed smaller than mg3:u, we need to demonstrate that  there is no selection against u-ending codons in nny codon families by showing that the observed nc/nu ratio is not greater than  <dig> , and  there is selection against g-ending codons in nnr codon families by showing that na/ng is significantly greater than  <dig> . it is not enough to show that nc/nu < na/ng.

we note that the observed nc/nu values for the seven nny codon families in table  <dig> are all smaller than the expected  <dig> , suggesting no selection against u-ending codons in nny codon families . in contrast the observed na/ng ratios for the five nnr codon families are all much greater than the expected  <dig>  , consistent with the interpretation of selection against g-ending codons in nnr codon families . this is consistent with the interpretation that mu3:g < mg3:u. one can perform a χ2-test for each of the nnr codon families to see if g-ending codons are underused. the tests are all highly significant, with p <  <dig> .

the results are similar for fungal genomes with translation table  <dig>  with the result from a representative species  presented in table  <dig>  again the nc/nu ratios in nny codon families are much smaller than na/ng ratios in nnr codon families. we should note that the s. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome is much more at-biased than the a. macrogynus mitochondrial genome, with the proportion of  in non-coding sequences being only  <dig> . the reason for the gc deficiency in yeast is not clear, but it may be caused either by mutation bias or by the low abundance of c in living cells  <cit> . in any case, the expected nc/nu and na/ng ratios, given the biased genomic at content, are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. we note that the observed nc/nu ratios among the nny codon families are all smaller than the expected value of  <dig>  except for the uuy  codon family , against suggesting little selection against u-ending codons . in contrast, the na/ng ratios are all significantly greater than the expected  <dig>  except for the aur  codon family, suggesting selection against g-ending codons . the exceptional aur  codon family has a trna with a cau anticodon which would favor g-ending codons and is expected to be different.

§ ncod: number of codons in the codon family

the nc/nu ratio for the uuy  codon family is consistently greater than those of other nny codon families . one may suspect whether, for this particular codon family, there is a significant mu3:g. the rate of trnaphe with anticodon 3'-aag-5' dissociating from the uuu codon is about twice as high as that from the fully matched uuc codon  <cit> . also, the trnaphe misread cuc codons more than twice as often as cuu codons  <cit> . these two lines of evidence suggest that c3:g pair is much more favorable than u3:g pair, i.e., mu3:g for the uuy  codon family may indeed be substantially greater than mc3:g. unfortunately, there has been no other similar studies on codon-anticodon pairing for other nny codon families. one should also note that the trnaphe in this study comes from escherichia coli, and the result may not be applicable to fungal species.

the two fungal species using genetic table  <dig>  i.e., spizellomyces punctatus and rhizophydium sp.  <dig> each have only a partial set of trna genes. among nny codon families in s. punctatus, only the gay  and uay codon family  have an identifiable trna, with anticodons being guc and gua, respectively. the expected nc/nu and na/ng ratios are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, based on the nucleotide frequencies of non-coding sequences in the mitochondrial genome. the observed nc/nu ratios for gay and uay codon families are  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively, suggesting no selection against u-ending codons . in contrast, the na/ng ratios are much larger, being  <dig>   for the aar codon family  translated by a trna with a uuu anticodon and  <dig>   for the car codon family  translated by a trna with a uug anticodon. these results suggest selection against g-ending codons  there is no other nnr codon family with identifiable trnas in s. punctatus. the other species using translation table  <dig>  rhizophydium sp.  <dig>  exhibits a similar pattern.

in short, results from fungal mitochondrial genomes are consistent with no selection against u-ending codons in nny codon families but significant selection against g-ending codons in nnr codon families, indicating that mu3:g is smaller than mg3:u. these findings corroborate previous biochemical studies demonstrating that u3:g is energetically much more favorable than g3:u  <cit> . however, g3:u can be almost as good as a3:u when u is modified to xm5u  <cit> .

the finding of a small mu3:g can explain puzzling observations in codon usage in fungal mitochondrial genomes. take the trnaser translating the agy codon family in the mitochondrial genome of ashbya gossypii atcc  <dig> for example. the genome contains  <dig> agu codons and no agc codon. caah would have predicted an acu anticodon with perfect base pair with agu codons, but the observed anticodon is gcu consistent with wvh. such an anticodon makes sense only if mu3:g is equal to mc3:g, i.e., a wobble g in a trna anticodon can pair with u just as good as with c in the third codon position.

can this finding be generalized to nuclear genomes and the translation machinery in the cytoplasm? if mu3:g is generally small, then we have an answer to a puzzling observation that has long baffled molecular evolutionary geneticists. the ugy codon family  in the nuclear genome of s. cerevisiae is translated by trna coded in four trnacys genes all with a wobble g at the trna anticodon. one would have predicted that ugc codons should be strongly preferred over ugu codons to avoid the wobble cost mu3:g. however, the observed numbers of ugc and ugu codons in s. cerevisiae cdss is  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, opposite to the predicted trend. the bias is even stronger in highly expressed genes. for example, in the codon usage table of highly expressed genes distributed with the emboss package , the numbers of ugc and ugu codons are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the unexpected codon usage bias  becomes easy to understand if mu3:g is equal to mc3:g, i.e., there is no need to overuse the ugc codons to avoid mu3:g so at-biased mutation in yeast , which increases the frequency of u-ending codons, is not checked by counteracting selection.

if the finding of mu3:g << mg3:u is applicable to nuclear genomes, then we predict that nny codon families need only one type of trna  for translation. in contrast, nnr codon families should ideally be translated by two different types of trnas, one with a wobble u for nna codons and the other with a wobble c for nng codons . a corollary is that, if a nny codon family is translated by only trna with a wobble g and nnr codon family by trna with a wobble u, then codon usage bias should be smaller in the nny codon family  than in the nnr codon family . below we test these predictions with genomic data.

nny codon families are translated by one type of trna with a wobble g and nnr codon families are translated by two types of trna with a wobble u and a wobble c, respectively, in fungal nuclear genomes
we have inferred that a trna with a wobble g at its anticodon should be efficient not only in translating c-ending codons, but also in translating u-ending codons because of the small mu3:g. for this reason, only one type of trna with a wobble g should generally be sufficient in translating nny codon families. in contrast, in nnr codon families, trna with a wobble u at its anticodon should be poor in translating g-ending codons because of the large mg3:u. thus, the presence of g-ending codons in nnr codon families should favour the use of two types of trnas, one with a wobble u for translating nna codons and another with a wobble c for translating nng codons. in mitochondrial genomes with limited gene content, each codon family is generally translated by a single trna species. so this prediction cannot be tested. however, this prediction can be tested with nuclear genomes where the number of trna genes is not so limited as in mitochondrial genomes.

the prediction is strongly supported by results from the nuclear genome of saccharomyces cerevisiae . all nnr codon families are translated by two types of trnas with anticodons matching nna and nng codons, respectively, whereas all nny codon families are translated by one type of trna with a wobble g at the trna anticodon . this is consistent with the interpretation that the inference of mu3:g << mg3:u derived from fungal mitochondrial genome is also applicable to fungal nuclear genomes.

one may propose an alternative hypothesis for the observation that nny codon families are translated by trnas with a wobble g whereas nnr codon families translated by trnas with a wobble c and a wobble u, respectively. the wobble a in some nuclear trnas is known to be converted to inosine or i for short  <cit>  which may pair with a, c or u. if a trna translating an nny codon family has its wobble g mutated to wobble a, then the wobble a may undergo the a→i conversion and misread nna codons. for this reason, the wobble g→a mutation should be strongly selected against, which would explain the lack of wobble a in trna translating nny codons.

this alternative hypothesis invoking the a→i conversion, while logically sound, was dismissed quite early after the discovery  <cit>  that the a→i conversion is quite restrictive and occurs mainly at acg or arv anticodons . among trnas translating nny codons, only trnaphe has a middle a in the anticodon, and the rest do not have an r in the middle of the anticodon. this means that, for all nny-translating trnas except for trnaphe, even if their regular wobble g mutates to a, the resulting wobble a will not be converted to inosine. thus, the alternative hypothesis can only explain the avoidance of a wobble a in trnaphe but cannot explain the avoidance of a wobble a in other nny-translating trnas.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our general hypothesis based on wobble costs allows the integration of the two conventional hypotheses  on codon-anticodon wobble pairing. the integration leads to new ways of evaluating relative wobble cost of different wobble pairings. in particular, the finding that mu3:g is much smaller than mg3:u corroborates previous structural studies showing that u3:g is energetically more favourable than g3:u and leads to a better understanding of the translation efficiency mediated by codon and anticodon wobble pairing.
