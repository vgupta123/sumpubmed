BACKGROUND
olfaction allows animals to perceive volatile chemicals from the environment and is therefore essential for the detection and discrimination of food resources, predators, and conspecifics in a diverse array of taxa  <cit> . in insects, intraspecific olfactory communication is predominantly based on the recognition of endogenous pheromones that are used to trigger a plethora of behaviors, including social interaction, mate choice, and mate identification  <cit> . chemosensory genes expressed in the peripheral sensory neurons of the insect antennae enable the detection of pheromone compounds, and thus are crucially important for the detection of olfactory cues with diverse ecological functions  <cit> . closely related species of insects often exhibit pheromone signals with minute quantitative and qualitative differences  <cit> . thus, highly specialized and sensitive signal recognition systems are necessary for discrimination of conspecific individuals and co-occurring  species. however, despite the relative importance of pheromone detection in the evolution of insect communication and speciation, the genetic mechanisms underlying the differentiation of pheromone recognition systems remain poorly understood  <cit> .

recent work on reproductively isolated sympatric races of the european corn borer, ostrinia nubilalis, has shown that divergence in pheromone recognition might be best explained by nucleotide substitutions in pheromone receptor genes  <cit> . although this study lacked a direct test on candidate genes, it suggests that molecular divergence of chemosensory genes could have promoted the early differentiation of pheromone sensory tuning in these two species of moth. this mechanism has been put forward to explain the rapid evolution of pheromone communication systems in other sympatric sibling species of lepidoptera  <cit> . in fact, a single receptor mutation was shown to drive the early divergence in pheromone detection in ostrinia furnacalis, a close relative to o. nubilalis  <cit> . however, it remains unclear whether these findings are broadly applicable to other insect taxa that rely on pheromone reception for sexual communication, mainly because few studies have examined the evolution of peripheral olfactory systems in closely related species. additionally, other molecular mechanisms could lead to changes in the odor perception ability of a species, including changes in expression rates of genes involved in olfaction  and the evolution of the gene repertoire through gene duplication and gene loss  <cit> . however, the relative impact of these two mechanisms on pheromone recognition of closely related species is less well understood.

the process of differentiation of communication channels requires concomitant shifts in both signal emission and signal perception  <cit> . thus, a change in the pheromone detection pathway is expected to take place along with a shift in pheromone composition. pheromone signals are usually synthesized metabolically de novo from relatively simple precursor building blocks  <cit> . therefore, a shift in the chemical communication system of an insect lineage requires the correlated modifications of two independent pathways: the biosynthesis of pheromone compounds and the olfactory detection of such pheromone compounds  <cit> . here we introduce an insect communication system in which a single pathway  is responsible for changes in both signal production and signal detection.

orchid bees  are some of the most important pollinators in the neotropical region, where they pollinate thousands of plant species from numerous angiosperm families  <cit> . unlike other insects, male orchid bees utilize unmodified exogenous volatiles to communicate species affiliation  that are further hypothesized to address females in the context of mating . male orchid bees collect chemical substances from various floral and non-floral sources to concoct a species-specific perfume blend . the perfume is stored in specialized pouches in the bee’s hind-tibiae and is eventually released in a ritualized courtship display behavior at sites where females arrive for mating . accordingly, it is expected that both male and female orchid bees use overlapping gene sets to detect perfume compounds . as a result, orchid bees rely on their olfactory sensory system to produce and detect species-specific chemical signals.

although the precise physiological mechanisms of perfume discrimination remain unknown, previous studies indicate that the olfactory periphery  plays a critical role in compound discrimination. preferences for conspecific perfume blends are accompanied by increased antennal responses in comparison to responses to perfumes of closely and distantly related species  <cit> . furthermore, single compounds that exclusively occur in the bouquet of a given species can elicit higher antennal responses of conspecifics compared to individuals of closely related species  <cit> . this suggests the presence of chemosensory genes that are tuned towards key perfume compounds, similar to what has been described for lepidopteran pheromone receptors .

all insect pheromone receptor genes characterized to date, including the honeybee queen pheromone receptor, belong to the odorant receptor  gene family, the largest of three chemosensory receptor multi-gene families involved in insect odor detection . unlike ors, only a subset of ionotropic receptors  and few members of the gustatory receptor  gene family are associated with olfaction . in addition to these three receptor gene families, odorant binding proteins  and chemosensory proteins  play a crucial role in peripheral olfactory recognition  <cit> . these two non-receptor multi-gene families encode soluble globular proteins that presumably help transport hydrophobic odorant molecules through the hydrophilic sensillum lymph  <cit> . while csps were shown to be involved in nest mate recognition in ants  <cit> , obps are necessary for pheromone reception in different insect species . the involvement of these five gene families in insect olfaction makes them potential targets of selection with cascading effects on intraspecific communication channels.

in this study we provide an analysis of the chemosensory gene families of two recently diverged  sibling species of orchid bees, namely euglossa dilemma bembé & eltz and e. viridissima friese from the yúcatan peninsula of mexico  <cit> . the perfume profiles of these two morphologically  <cit>  and ecologically  <cit>  similar species differ mainly in the presence of a single compound  in e. dilemma and its complete absence in e. viridissima perfumes  <cit> . this compound of unknown origin is found in the perfume of only one other orchid bee species, namely euglossa mixta, which is distantly related to e. dilemma, suggesting possible multiple independent origins of hndb collection in orchid bees  <cit> . in fact, hndb comprises on average more than 60 % of the e. dilemma perfume blend. moreover, hndb attracts volatile-seeking males of e. dilemma but not e. viridissima when presented as a single compound in chemical bioassays in the field  <cit> . concordantly, antennae of both male and female e. dilemma are more sensitive to hndb than those of e. viridissima suggesting that behavioral differences might be based on divergence in the antennal periphery . the marked recent divergence between these sibling species provides unique opportunities to study the evolutionary genetic mechanisms that shaped peripheral olfactory recognition systems. for this purpose, we first identified the repertoires of all five focal chemosensory gene families in e. dilemma and e. viridissima. due to the large genome sizes  we employed an antennal transcriptome sequencing approach coupled with a highly conservative de novo meta-assembly strategy. we analyzed the orthologous chemosensory gene sets found in both species and screened for patterns of divergent evolution. our findings demonstrate that, despite the overall low divergence between these sibling species, divergent evolution of key chemosensory genes is accelerated, possibly due to divergent selection on the or gene family.

RESULTS
candidate gene detection
to identify chemosensory genes of the or, ir, gr, obp, and csp gene families in euglossa dilemma and e. viridissima, we reconstructed the antennal transcriptomes for each species using a conservative meta-assembly approach . in order to validate assembly quality, we annotated the transcriptomes by blat comparisons to  <dig>  honeybee reference protein sequences that are not members of the focal chemosensory gene families  gene set; refseq database accessed 10/22/12). this resulted in  <dig> unique annotations of which more than 90 % were detected independently in both species and >70 % of all shared annotations showed ≥95 % completeness and contiguity of open reading frames  . overall,  <dig> full-length ortholog nc genes passed further conservative filter criteria and were later used for divergence analyses.

chemosensory gene discovery using iterative tblastn searches on the antennal transcriptomes revealed  <dig> euglossa loci homologous to known members of the five targeted chemosensory gene families of bees and wasps  of which  <dig>  full-length orthologs were shared between e. dilemma and e. viridissima and thus were supported by independent discovery in the two sibling species .table  <dig> chemosensory genes detected in the antennal transcriptomes of e. dilemma and e. viridissima

with  <dig> candidate genes, the largest number of loci we identified among chemosensory genes belonged to the or gene family, corresponding to 77 % of all candidate chemosensory loci detected. of all or genes,  <dig>  were present in full length in the transcriptomes of both species. additionally, of five candidate grs and five candidate irs, one and four orthologs were shared between species, respectively. the non-receptor chemosensory gene families were represented by  <dig> unique candidate genes, of which only two could not be detected in both species’ antennal transcriptomes. this resulted in  <dig> and five shared full-length ortholog obps and csps, respectively.

we note that it is unlikely that the detected candidate genes represent the complete repertoire of the e. dilemma and e. viridissima chemosensory gene families, because detection is not possible if expression levels of target genes are too low, or specific to unexamined sexes, life stages or tissues. for example, it has been established that there is a typical 1: <dig> relationship of ors and the number of glomeruli in the antennal lobes across insect lineages  <cit> . thus, based on ~ <dig> glomeruli in the antennal lobes of each analyzed euglossa species , we estimate that we detected ~50 % of the functional ors. however, the detected genes likely cover a large fraction of chemosensory genes important in intraspecific olfactory communication, as these are typically among the highest expressed chemosensory genes in insects and thus very likely to be detected in antennal transcriptome analyses  <cit> .

chemosensory gene family dynamics
phylogenetic inferences of the candidate chemosensory genes validated the homology of all the loci detected in relation to their respective gene families. each euglossa locus clustered with known honeybee representatives of the assigned gene family . in contrast to the or gene family, we identified simple 1: <dig> orthologous relationships for all but two non-or chemosensory genes to known chemosensory genes of the honeybee, the closest relative with a completely known chemosensory gene family set  <cit> . this included all five irs, all of which were orthologous to genes of the olfactory ‘antennal ir’ subfamily . of five grs, four had simple orthologous relationships to known honeybee grs including an ortholog of a candidate sugar receptor . interestingly, the gr without a simple ortholog formed the outgroup of a cluster of three honeybee gr pseudogenes . simple orthologs were also identified for all csps. all but one obp  were also assigned to honeybee orthologs including one ortholog of obp <dig> of the mason bee osmia cornuta for which binding affinities to several odors have been established  <cit> . all the euglossa obps we identified were found to be orthologous to obps of the classical subfamily and/or exhibited six conserved cysteines typical for that subfamily . interestingly, two candidate obps were orthologous to honeybee obps that are not expressed in antennal tissue of either sex or caste, and were also absent in antennal transcriptomes of o. cornuta  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships of the  <dig> candidate e. dilemma and  <dig> e. viridissima odorant receptors  to apis mellifera. the maximum likelihood tree was rooted by the or co-receptor orthologs of all three species. bootstrap values for branches with ≥50 % support are indicated. ors marked in red correspond to the  <dig> orthologs with d

the relationships between the ors of euglossa and the honeybee were less unambiguous in relation to the dynamics of the other chemosensory families. only  <dig> of the  <dig> detected euglossa ors  showed simple 1: <dig> orthology to known honeybee ors , indicating increased gene family divergence. although the euglossa homolog of the highly conserved or co-receptor  <cit>  could be identified, none of the euglossa ors were orthologous to any of the three honeybee ors that have been functionally characterized to date  <cit> . thus, potential ligands of euglossa ors remain unidentified. the lack of orthology of several euglossa-specific ors to honeybee ors, indicated  <dig> euglossa-specific or duplications signified by clusters of one honeybee or as outgroup to two different euglossa ors . we furthermore found two subfamily expansions of three or more euglossa ors . on the other hand, several honeybee ors had no direct orthologs that could be detected in euglossa. this is not surprising given the likely incompleteness of or sets in the analyzed species of euglossa .

patterns of nucleotide polymorphism and diversifying selection
we mapped antennal reads from a pool of  <dig> haploid males for each species against the orfs of all the detected full-length chemosensory and nc genes. we excluded orfs that lacked a mean per-base coverage ≥10-fold in both orthologs, but retained  <dig> nc genes as well as  <dig> ors, four irs, one gr,  <dig> obps and five csps . overall,  <dig> chemosensory loci and  <dig> nc loci were variable  between e. dilemma and e. viridissima, corresponding to 45 % and 13 % of the reconstructed candidate genes, respectively. with  <dig> loci, the majority  of variable chemosensory genes belonged to the or gene family, while for each remaining chemosensory gene family only one or two loci showed polymorphisms between the two species . this is not surprising given the number of reconstructed loci in each gene family. in total, we identified  <dig> variable sites, of which  <dig> were found in chemosensory genes and  <dig> in nc genes, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  sites, respectively, representing fixed differences between e. dilemma and e. viridissima. altogether,  <dig> chemosensory loci  and  <dig> nc loci contained sites fixed for different nucleotides in the two species . overall, the ratio of fixed to polymorphic sites was higher in the chemosensory gene family sets . furthermore, the chemosensory gene families showed a significantly elevated ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous fixed sites in comparison to the nc gene set .table  <dig> nucleotide polymorphisms and patterns of selection between orthologous genes

patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms enriched for fixed non-synonymous in comparison to synonymous substitutions as observed for the combined chemosensory gene set are expected in the presence of diversifying selection. to test for diversifying selection on the  <dig> candidate genes with fixed interspecific differences, we used the non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates between e. dilemma and e. viridissima to calculate pairwise replacement to silent substitution rate ratios . therefore, we only took fixed sites into consideration because polymorphic sites are known to inflate dn/ds estimates, especially between species with comparatively low divergence times . consistent with the observed patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms, dn was significantly higher for chemosensory loci than for nc loci  while ds showed similar values for both sets of genes . this resulted in an elevated mean dn/ds for the chemosensory loci  indicating relaxed purifying and/or increased diversifying selection on chemosensory genes. although mean dn/ds was smaller than  <dig> for both gene sets, we detected  <dig> chemosensory receptors  and  <dig> nc genes with dn/ds >  <dig> , indicating that positive selection may have driven divergence in these candidate genes. the set of genes corresponds to  <dig>  % of the chemosensory loci identified and  <dig>  % of the nc gene set. this observation suggests that divergent selective pressures are increased in genes of the olfactory periphery, in particular in chemosensory receptors . accordingly, the set of genes with dn/ds >  <dig> was significantly enriched for chemosensory receptors compared to those with dn/ds <  <dig> .fig.  <dig> analysis of divergent selection between e. dilemma and e. viridissima. a boxplot comparing d

cfixed substitutions in ligand binding domains  of ors  and irs 



we estimated a mean of  <dig>  fixed substitutions per gene among the  <dig> genes with dn/ds >  <dig> . in fact, only  <dig> of these genes contained at least three fixed substitutions , five out of  <dig> nc genes ). in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> remaining genes had only  <dig> fixed substitution, of which the majority  belonged to the nc gene set . thus, most of the genes with dn/ds >  <dig> were fixed for just one non-synonymous substitution between e. dilemma and e. viridissima.

to test whether the dn/ds values differ from a null model of neutral evolution, we applied likelihood ratio tests to all orthologous pairs of chemosensory and nc genes. interestingly, of the  <dig> gene pairs with fixed interspecific differences, only two dn/ds estimates were significantly different from the null model. of these or <dig> showed a dn/ds significantly higher than  <dig>  and or <dig> showed a dn/ds significantly lower than  <dig> . this low number of genes diverging from the neutral null model is likely to reflect the generally low power of pairwise dn/ds estimates  <cit>  as well as the low number of fixed differences between the two species.

spatial distribution of non-synonymous substitutions
non-synonymous changes in ligand binding domains of receptor proteins can alter affinities towards ligands, modifying ligand interaction patterns . we determined the spatial distribution of non-synonymous substitutions along or and ir protein sequences with dn/ds >  <dig> to examine potential effects on ligand binding domains. therefore, we predicted transmembrane domains , the regions of or proteins most sensitive to non-synonymous substitutions with regard to ligand binding  <cit> . moreover, we used homology to known drosophila irs and the closely related ionotropic glutamate receptors  to infer ligand-binding domains . in total,  <dig>  of the  <dig> non-synonymous substitutions fixed in the  <dig> ors having dn/ds >  <dig> between e. dilemma and e. viridissima were located in one of the seven transmembrane domains  which covered between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the or amino acid sequence . additionally,  <dig>  of  <dig> replacement substitutions were located in the ir ligand binding domains that covered  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the ir <dig> and ir <dig> amino acid sequence, respectively . interestingly, only three of the  <dig> chemosensory receptors  did not reveal any change in the amino acid sequence of respective ligand binding domains. in order to test whether fixed non-synonymous substitutions are randomly distributed among ors and irs, we applied a goodness-of-fit test on the observed number of substitutions by estimating the mean proportion of receptor proteins that span ligand-binding domains. these tests revealed that the observed number of fixed non-synonymous substitutions were non-randomly distributed among ors and were significantly enriched for transmembrane domains . furthermore, non-synonymous substitutions in ligand-binding domains were positively correlated with the number of non-synonymous substitutions . concomitantly, the four chemosensory receptors that exhibited at least five fixed substitutions had the most replacement substitutions in ligand binding domains , thus increasing the likelihood that such non-synonymous substitutions lead to changes in ligand-binding affinities.fig.  <dig> distribution of non-synonymous amino acid substitutions across odorant receptor  domains. a the white bars represent the sum of all non-synonymous substitutions detected in the respective domain over all ors. or <dig>  or <dig> and or <dig> are highlighted because they showed the most non-synonymous substitutions between e. dilemma and e. viridissima. in: intracellular n-terminus, tm: transmembrane domain, el: external loop, il: internal loop, ec: extracellular c-terminus. b predicted membrane topology for or <dig>  fixed non-synonymous substitutions between e. dilemma and e. viridissima are highlighted in black



graphical analysis of the spatial distribution along the ors revealed that the majority of non-synonymous substitutions are located towards the n-terminus rather than towards the c-terminus of the receptor , matching known patterns of higher or sequence conservation towards the c-terminus . this pattern is also retained for a subset of the three ors with at least five fixed substitutions between e. dilemma and e. viridissima.

discussion
the differentiation of intraspecific chemical communication systems depends on correlated shifts of signal production and signal detection  <cit> . in the case of chemical signaling of insect species, the emitter and receiver components are typically controlled by independent genetic pathways  <cit> . in the present study we focused on an exceptional communication system, where a single pathway regulates both signal production and signal detection. orchid bees rely on their peripheral olfactory system to detect compounds for the composition of their so-called perfumes. these perfume phenotypes are thought to function as intraspecific recognition signals and have been shown to be highly differentiated even among closely related species . as a result, chemosensory genes are likely the targets of selection during the evolutionary process of signal differentiation. we tested this hypothesis in a pair of recently diverged sibling species of orchid bees, euglossa dilemma and e. viridissima  <cit>  whose perfumes differ mainly in one key chemical component. we compared the evolutionary patterns of differentiation of  <dig> orthologous chemosensory genes and  <dig> genes that are not involved in chemoreception  derived from a de novo antennal transcriptome analysis.

accelerated evolution of the olfactory periphery
comparisons of the estimated dn and ds patterns based on orthologous chemosensory and nc genes indicate faster evolution of the chemosensory gene families driven in part by strong divergent selective pressures. our analysis identified fixed nucleotide differences between the two sister species in 13 % of all analyzed genes. this low percentage probably reflects the short time span since the divergence of e. dilemma and e. viridissima  <cit> . however, chemosensory genes exhibited an elevated mean non-synonymous substitution rate  that produced a mean dn/ds ratio ~ <dig>  times higher than those estimated for nc genes. while this pattern is consistent with accelerated diversification rates in the chemosensory gene families, several underlying mechanisms could be at play. first, this pattern could be explained by relaxed purifying selection on chemosensory genes. relaxation of purifying selection in chemosensory genes is usually expected following gene duplication events  <cit> . however, analyses of the or gene families from a number of drosophila species have indicated that lineage-specific duplications among closely related sibling species  are rare  <cit> . although the or gene family is the most dynamic among all chemosensory gene families, previous studies have identified very few lineage-specific duplication events, even among species evolving under highly divergent ecological conditions. for instance a maximum of four duplication events was estimated between the host specialist d. sechellia and the host generalist d. simulans, which have a divergence time of ~ <dig>  mya  <cit> . in contrast, the elevated dn/ds ratio that we observed between e. dilemma and e. viridissima is based on  <dig> variable chemosensory genes including  <dig> variable ors. hence, it is unlikely that the observed patterns are greatly influenced by lineage specific duplication events. consistently, we could not find any evidence for lineage specific duplications in either species. however, we note that recent duplication events may have gone undetected in our dataset for several reasons  and that relaxation of purifying selective pressures might occur even in the absence of duplication events. we therefore cannot exclude relaxed purifying selection as a mechanism that shaped the evolution of chemosensory genes in orchid bees.

alternatively, the observed patterns of dn/ds ratios could reflect signatures of positive selection. we identified  <dig> chemosensory genes with dn/ds >  <dig>  which is consistent with the hypothesis of positive selection in one or both euglossa lineages. nevertheless, due to the overall low variability between species, the calculated dn/ds ratios for several loci were based on few fixed differences alone. while previous studies have reported relatively low variability in chemosensory genes under divergent selective pressures in closely related insect species  <cit> , we detected genes with both dn/ds >  <dig> and comparably high interspecific diversity of which one  was significantly different from a neutral null model of sequence divergence . the fact that only a single gene exhibited a significantly elevated dn/ds ratio is not surprising given the low amount of fixed interspecific differences between e. dilemma and e. viridissima and the low power of pairwise dn/ds tests in detecting genes under divergent selection  <cit> . accordingly, we expect that the test produced several false negatives that may be revealed by more sensitive phylogeny-based dn/ds tests, as well as more comprehensive lineage sampling  <cit> . in addition, the comparatively short divergence time between e. dilemma and e. viridissima bears the potential of biasing dn/ds estimates, that could lead to false positives  <cit> . to account for this, we chose an approach that enabled the detection and exclusion of the main source of dn/ds inflation, namely segregating polymorphisms  <cit> . the resulting patterns of dn and ds that we observed between chemosensory genes and the nc gene set  using fixed differences only are similar to that observed in other insects that exhibit much greater divergence times  <cit> , thus indicating that our approach is suited for the detection of selective pressures on the chemosensory gene sets of e. dilemma and e. viridissima.

our results are consistent with the hypothesis that genes of the olfactory peripheral system of e. dilemma and e. viridissima have evolved under strong divergent selective pressures. together, these observations support a significant trend of increased divergent selective pressures that may have shaped the recent evolution of chemosensory genes in e. dilemma and e. viridissima.

are the observed patterns of diversifying selection related to divergence in chemical signaling?
the observed sequence divergence in orthologous olfactory receptor genes of e. dilemma and e. viridissima is likely linked to differences in the sensory tuning of each species, and possibly represents a response to divergent selection on chemosensory traits  <cit> . various ecological factors may have promoted such differentiation, including host shifts  <cit>  and changes in mating ecology  <cit> . in solitary bees, several ecological factors may impose selective pressures on sensory detection, including foraging on different food resources , the use of different nesting materials, and the detection of suitable mating places and partners. however, both e. dilemma and e. viridissima are pollen generalists that are known to use very similar food resources  <cit> , and the two species lack any noticeable differences in nesting biology . thus, it is unlikely that the divergence we observed in olfactory receptor genes was due to selective pressures acting on foraging specialization. the most pronounced difference that has been documented between the two sympatric sibling species is on the chemical composition of male perfumes  <cit> .

the males of all species of orchid bees collect and accumulate species-specific perfumes  <cit>  from a variety of sources. likewise, e. dilemma and e. viridissima show distinct species-specific perfume phenotypes that are qualitatively and quantitatively differentiated. in particular, these two species differ in the presence of hndb in e. dilemma perfumes and the complete absence in e. viridissima  <cit> . this difference corresponds to pronounced behavioral and physiological responses. males of e. dilemma are strongly attracted to hndb, whereas males of e. viridissima are never attracted to this compound  <cit> . correspondingly, the antennae of e. dilemma exhibit a significantly stronger neurophysiological response and sensitivity to hndb, compared to a weaker response in e. viridissima  <cit> . consequently, the observed divergence of the chemosensory gene families on the molecular level suggest that the chemical, physiological, and behavioral differences between this pair of species might be mediated—at least partially—by some of the genetic differences we identified in the chemosensory gene families.

previous studies have hypothesized that perfume bouquets in orchid bees function as species-specific signals that are addressed to conspecific females in the context of mating . thus, because olfaction determines both signal production and signal detection, evolutionary shifts in the olfactory pathway may lead to concomitant divergence in sexual communication in orchid bees. genomic studies on closely related species of drosophilid flies have revealed that the primary targets of diversifying selection are, in fact, sex-related genes  <cit> . moreover, previous studies on lepidoptera and drosophilid flies have determined that those or genes with elevated dn/ds ratios tend to be involved in the perception of sex pheromones  <cit> . our results lend support to the hypothesis that candidate chemosensory receptors evolved under strong divergent selection in the e. dilemma and e. viridissima lineage, and thus selective forces may have contributed to shifts in the detection of odors that mediate sexual communication in one or both species.

chemosensory receptor driven evolution of the peripheral olfactory pathway
the observed pattern of divergent selection in chemosensory receptors suggests that the olfactory peripheral system plays a major role in the evolution of olfactory specialization in e. dilemma and e. viridissima. among all the five families of chemosensory genes we studied, signatures of divergent selection were only present in or genes and antennal ir genes. this result is partially consistent with an earlier hypothesis that a shift in peripheral olfaction between e. dilemma and e. viridissima might be driven by molecular divergence in or genes  <cit> , a common mechanism of olfactory diversification in insects  <cit> .

currently we lack information on the functional properties of the detected divergent chemosensory receptors. to gain some insight into potential impact of the observed substitutions, we inferred the transmembrane  and ligand-biding domains in both ors and irs. based on these topological predictions, the majority of the molecular differences between the sister species could affect the biochemical features of the receptors. for most of the ors that exhibited signatures of diversifying selection, amino acid substitutions were detected in tm regions, where a single replacement can be sufficient to elicit shifts in ligand binding properties, as previously demonstrated in several insect taxa . predicted amino acid substitutions in the s <dig> and s <dig> binding domains of a candidate ir might have similar consequences  <cit> . accordingly, diversifying selection acting on euglossa ors and irs might have led to divergent ligand binding properties of chemosensory receptor orthologs of the two species and in turn could account for the observed differences in antennal responses.

the neurophysiological difference in the response of e. dilemma and e. viridissima to volatile compounds could also be determined by higher-level integration of the central nervous system, e.g. neuronal networks in the antennal lobe or mushroom body. nevertheless, the strong differentiation observed in antennal responses supports a scenario where the olfactory peripheral system profoundly affects the functioning of this chemical sexual communication system  <cit> . in orchid bees, differentiation of olfactory tuning through divergence of chemosensory receptors could have cascading effects on the species-specific perfumes that male bees acquire. similarly, studies on moths have identified single non-synonymous substitutions in or genes that lead to strong differentiation in pheromone detection abilities  <cit> . comparative analyses have shown that the perfume phenotypes of orchid bees evolve exceptionally fast, even among closely related species  <cit> . because non-synonymous substitutions in the olfactory periphery may simultaneously affect both male traits and female preference, diversifying selection acting on chemosensory receptors could serve as a mechanism to account for the fast evolutionary rates observed in perfume phenotypes among orchid bees. in fact, physical genetic linkage between sender and receiver genes could potentially accelerate the evolution of assortative mating and rapid modification of sexual communication channels . this, in turn, could help explain the high species richness of orchid bees throughout the neotropical region  <cit> , and could lead to an understanding of the speciation mechanisms in orchid bees.

CONCLUSIONS
while the vast majority of insect species relies on chemical communication to find mates in order to successfully reproduce, the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of pheromone recognition systems remain poorly understood, especially for non-model organisms. in this study we show that gene families in the olfactory periphery of euglossa dilemma and e. viridissima, two recently diverged orchid bee species, likely evolved under divergent selection. because signal production and signal detection are genetically linked in orchid bees, our findings support the hypothesis that divergent evolution of or genes likely played a role in shaping both olfactory perception and divergence of chemical mating signals. our results are consistent with previous studies on lepidopterans and indicate the general significance of selection acting on chemosensory receptors as a driver mechanism of diversification in insect pheromones.
