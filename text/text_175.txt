BACKGROUND
the pancreas is an endodermally derived organ that forms from a ventral and a dorsal evagination of the foregut epithelium. these two evaginations, the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds, subsequently grow, branch and differentiate into distinct pancreatic cell types  <cit> . the homeodomain transcription factor insulin promoter factor 1/pancreatic and duodenal homeobox  <dig>  is one of the earliest markers of the developing pancreas. ipf1/pdx <dig> is expressed already at ~ <dig> somites stage at the regions of the dorsal and ventral gut endoderm from which the pancreatic buds evaginate  <cit> . ipf1/pdx <dig> expression remains high in pancreatic epithelial cells until ~e <dig>  after which it is down-regulated  <cit>  and remains low in proliferating pancreatic epithelial cells. strong ipf1/pdx <dig> expression reappears in the differentiating β-cells as they emerge at ~e <dig>  <cit>  and high level of ipf1/pdx <dig> expression is maintained in adult β-cells where ipf1/pdx <dig> controls the expression of several key β-cell genes, including the insulin gene, thereby ensuring normal β-cell function and glucose homeostasis  <cit> .

loss of ipf1/pdx <dig> gene function in mice and humans results in pancreatic agenesis demonstrating a key role for the ipf1/pdx <dig> gene in pancreatic development  <cit> . ipf1/pdx <dig> is, however, not required for the initiation of the pancreatic program and the initial stages of pancreas development, i.e. the formation of the pancreatic buds, still occurs in ipf1/pdx1-/- mice  <cit> . although the pancreatic program is initiated in ipf1/pdx <dig> deficient embryos, the subsequent growth of the embryonic pancreas is arrested, resulting in pancreas agenesis  <cit> . recombination experiments between pancreatic epithelium and pancreatic mesenchyme have demonstrated that the pancreatic developmental defect observed in ipf1/pdx1-/- embryos is confined to the epithelial cells  <cit> . thus, pancreatic mesenchyme isolated from ipf1/pdx1-/- e <dig>  dorsal pancreatic buds could support the growth of wt e <dig>  dorsal pancreatic epithelium whereas the reverse combination failed to grow  <cit> . these data provide evidence for a cell-autonomous role for ipf1/pdx <dig> in early pancreatic progenitor cells. to date, no direct or indirect ipf1/pdx <dig> downstream genes have, however, been identified that can explain the pancreatic phenotype observed in ipf1/pdx1-/- embryos.

to identify ipf1/pdx <dig> target genes in early pancreatic progenitor cells and to begin to unravel the molecular mechanisms that lead to the attenuation of pancreatic growth in ipf1/pdx1-/- mice we performed microarray analyses on cdna prepared from ipf1/pdx1-/- e <dig>  buds and stage matched littermate wildtype controls. we have identified genes that are differentially expressed in ipf1/pdx1-/- pancreatic buds and a subset of these was chosen for further expression analysis by quantitative real-time  rt-pcr, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. in agreement with the pancreatic developmental defect observed in ipf1/pdx1-/- embryos, several of the differentially expressed genes identified in this study encode factors linked to pancreatic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.

RESULTS
gene expression changes in ipf1/pdx1-/- pancreatic buds
in order to identify candidate ipf1/pdx <dig> downstream genes in early pancreatic progenitor cells, dorsal pancreatic buds were isolated from e <dig>  ipf1/pdx1-/- and ipf1/pdx1+/+ littermate embryos. cdna was prepared from pancreatic buds derived from  <dig> independent ipf1/pdx1-/- and  <dig> independent ipf1/pdx1+/+ littermates respectively, labeled and hybridized to two different sets of microarrays. the first contain approximately  <dig>  clones obtained through large-scale, in-house est sequencing of three cdna libraries originating from a neural tissue stem cell compartment , neurospheres , and a hematopoietic stem cell line expressing the lhx <dig> gene  <cit> . the second cdna array used in this study contains  <dig>  clones derived from two different clone sets: a  <dig>  mouse cdna set from national institute of aging  and a  <dig>  cdna clone set obtained from research genetics. genes that showed a change in expression that was two-fold or more and had sufficiently high test-statistics were considered to be differentially expressed . the microarray analyses revealed a total number of  <dig> genes that were differently expressed. of these  <dig> were down-regulated  and  <dig> were up-regulated  in e <dig>  dorsal pancreatic buds of ipf1/pdx <dig> deficient mice as compared to that of stage matched wildtype littermates.

altered expression of genes associated with cell proliferation and differentiation
given the pancreatic growth arrest phenotype of ipf1/pdx1-/- mice we selected a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes identified by the microarray  that encode factors linked to growth and differentiation for further expression analyses and validation by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. the selected genes include genes previously associated with pancreatic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, including nk <dig> transcription factor related, locus  <dig> , v-erb-b <dig> erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog  <dig> , secreted phosphoprotein  <dig>  and paired box gene  <dig> , as well as genes encoding factors that previously have not been linked to pancreas development, such as spondin  <dig> , microsomal glutathione s-transferase  <dig> , reticulon  <dig> , basic leucine zipper nuclear factor  <dig> , schwannomin interacting protein  <dig> , and secreted frizzled related protein <dig> .

in agreement with the microarray data and previous findings  <cit> , the expression of the nkx <dig> , which encode a homeodomain transcription factor that alike ipf1/pdx <dig> is expressed in pancreatic progenitors and later in pancreatic β-cells  <cit> , was virtually undetectable in e <dig>  ipf1/pdx1-/- dorsal pancreatic buds . immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the loss of nkx <dig>  expression in e <dig> ipf1/pdx1-/- dorsal pancreatic buds . in contrast, the expression of the pan-endodermal marker foxa <dig> was normal in e <dig>  ipf1/pdx1-/-dorsal pancreatic buds  and sox <dig> in situ hybridization clearly depicted strong expression of sox <dig> in both the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds in the mutant embryos . these data demonstrate that the difference in gene expression observed in wildtype and ipf1/pdx1-/- dorsal pancreatic buds do not reflect a general decrease in endodermally expressed genes. the expression of pax <dig>  which encode a transcription factor expressed, and involved, in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation  <cit>  was reduced by ~69% in e <dig>  ipf1/pdx1-/-dorsal pancreatic buds . nevertheless, glucagon-expressing cells still appear in the ipf1/pdx1-/- mutant pancreas  and glucagon expression was largely unaffected in e <dig>  ipf1/pdx1-/- dorsal pancreatic buds , providing evidence that the remaining pax <dig> expression is sufficient to ensure glucagon expression. the expression of erbb <dig>  a receptor of the egf-family that previously has been implicated in pancreatic growth  <cit> , was reduced by ~74% in e <dig>  ipf1/pdx1-/- dorsal pancreatic buds . the expression of two genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins, spp <dig> and spon <dig>  was reduced by ~91% and ~93%, respectively in e <dig>  ipf1/pdx1-/- dorsal pancreatic buds . spp <dig>  also known as osteopontin, is known to be expressed in the fetal pancreatic epithelium and although spp <dig> has been implicated in cell adhesion and migration in several tissues the pancreas develops normally in spp <dig> deficient mice  <cit> . spon <dig> encodes the protein f-spondin that is involved in proliferation of vascular smc, neurite outgrowth and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells  <cit> . the reduced expression of spon <dig> in e <dig>  pancreatic progenitor cells was confirmed by in situ hybridization . the expression of mgst <dig>  which encode an integral membrane protein involved in cellular response to chemical or oxidative stress  <cit>  and rtn <dig>  which encodes a neuroendocrine-specific protein  <cit> , was reduced by 64% and 60%, respectively in e <dig>  ipf1/pdx1-/- dorsal pancreatic buds .

in contrast, three genes, blzf <dig>  a gene up-regulated by retinoids  <cit> , schip <dig>  which is involved in cell cycle regulation  <cit> , and sfrp <dig>  which encode a secreted antagonist to wnt signaling  <cit> , which all were identified as differentially expressed in the microarray analysis could not be validated when analyzed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr and were excluded from further analyses . taken together, these data show that the expression of several genes implicated in growth, differentiation and adhesion, some of which have previously been associated with pancreatic development, is impaired in ipf1/pdx1-/- pancreatic progenitor cells.

ptf1a/p <dig> and fgfr2iiib expression is perturbed in ipf1/pdx1-/- pancreatic buds
the expression of two genes, pancreas specific transcription factor 1a/p <dig>  and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2iiib , that previously have been implicated to have a role in pancreatic development  <cit>  but which were not spotted on the microarray chips were also analyzed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. fgfr2iiib is expressed in the developing pancreas and in fgfr2iiib null mutant mice pancreatic growth is reduced and the branching and morphogenesis of the pancreatic ductal epithelium is impaired  <cit> . quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis revealed that fgfr2iiib expression was reduced by ~75% in e <dig>  ipf1/pdx1-/- dorsal pancreatic buds compared to that of stage matched ipf1/pdx1+/+ dorsal pancreatic buds . immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the reduced expression of fgfr2iiib in e <dig>  pancreatic progenitor cells of ipf1/pdx1-/- deficient mice .

ptf1a/p <dig> has been implicated in commitment and proliferation of pancreatic progenitor cells and ptf1a/p48-/- null mutant mice fail to develop a pancreas  <cit> . quantitative real-time rt-pcr analyses showed that ptf1a/p <dig> expression was reduced by ~91% in ipf1/pdx1-/- e <dig>  dorsal pancreatic buds as compared to wild-type littermates . in situ hybridization analyses confirmed the reduced expression of ptf1a/p <dig> in dorsal pancreatic buds of ipf1/pdx1-/- embryos compared to wildtype littermates . these results suggest that in early pancreatic progenitor cells both fgfr2iiib and ptf1a/p <dig> are direct or indirect ipf1/pdx <dig> downstream target genes.

spon <dig> expression in pancreatic progenitor cells overlaps temporally with the phase of proliferation
spon <dig> encodes the extracellular matrix protein f-spondin, also known as vascular smooth muscle cell growth-promoting factor. f-spondin stimulates the proliferation and growth of vascular smc during ovarian growth and development  <cit> . in addition, f-spondin has been reported to promote neurite outgrowth from spinal chord, hippocampal and sensory neurons  <cit>  as well as the differentiation of neural progenitor cells  <cit> . spon <dig> has not previously been described to be expressed in the developing pancreas. thus, we next determined the temporal and spatial expression of spon <dig> in the developing pancreas by in situ hybridization.

at e <dig>  spon <dig> expression was observed in epithelium of the dorsal and ventral pancreatic bud . spon <dig> expression was maintained within the pancreatic epithelium of the developing pancreas until e <dig> , although the expression appeared reduced at this stage . by e <dig>  spon <dig> expression was no longer detectable within the pancreas . throughout pancreatic development spon <dig> expression was restricted to the developing pancreatic epithelium and the forming acini whereas no expression was observed in differentiated endocrine cells . in contrast to ipf1/pdx <dig>  spon <dig> was not expressed in the developing duodenal epithelium . these data imply that additional transcription factors act to restrict spon <dig> expression in the developing gastrointestinal tract and also suggest that spon <dig> may be used as a marker to distinguish between early pancreatic and duodenal cells.

discussion
in ipf1/pdx <dig> deficient embryos, pancreatic development becomes arrested around e <dig>  <cit>  but the molecular mechanism underlying this early developmental arrest has remained largely unknown. to begin to identify genes regulated by ipf1/pdx <dig> in early pancreatic progenitor cells that could help to explain the developmental arrest observed in ipf1/pdx <dig> -/- embryos we embarked on a gene array profiling and quantitative real-time rt-pcr approach. given the early developmental arrest and hence limiting amount of tissue, i.e. dorsal buds from e <dig>  ipf1/pdx <dig> +/+ and ipf1/pdx <dig> -/- litter pairs, that could be retrieved for further cdna synthesis we first performed a pilot study using the  <dig> k cdna chip that was hybridized twice with cdna prepared from dorsal buds of a matched ipf1/pdx <dig> +/+ and ipf1/pdx <dig> -/- e <dig>  litter pair.

this pilot study was followed by two hybridizations of the  <dig> k cdna chip with cdna prepared from another pair of matched ipf1/pdx <dig> +/+ and ipf1/pdx <dig> -/- e <dig>  dorsal buds. the  <dig> k cdna chip was originally hybridized with cdna from  <dig> pairs of ipf1/pdx <dig> +/+ and ipf1/pdx <dig> -/- e <dig>  dorsal buds in a standard manner. however due to technical problems in the hybridization step one of the arrays had to be excluded from the experiment resulting in a  <dig> arrays from the  <dig> k experiment. in summary a total of  <dig> independent pairs of ipf1/pdx <dig> +/+ and ipf1/pdx <dig> -/- e <dig>  dorsal buds were analyzed on four  <dig> k arrays and three  <dig> k arrays.

hence, there were some limitations in our microarray study. we had a total of four biological replicates per condition: the  <dig> k experiment used only  <dig> biological replicates per condition and the  <dig> k experiment used  <dig> biological replicates per condition. this limitation was due to challenges in retrieving sufficient tissue material for subsequent cdna synthesis. we analyzed separately the data from the two arrays, so the results of these analyses are based on a small number of biological replicates. furthermore, the experimental design was unbalanced in various ways . thus, the list of differentially expressed genes identified solely by our microarray experiments might be sub-optimal in terms of a bona fide candidate list. however, it provided us with sufficient information for selecting potentially interesting ipf1/pdx <dig> regulated genes that we followed-up with quantitative real-time rt-pcr, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.

here we show that the expression of fgfr2iiib is reduced in ipf1/pdx1-/- e <dig>  pancreatic buds, thus linking ipf1/pdx <dig> to fgf signaling in pancreatic progenitor cells. fgf signaling has been shown to be important both for normal pancreas development and maintenance of pancreatic function in adults  <cit> . mice with a targeted disruption of fgf <dig> show an early block in pancreas development that is reminiscent of that observed in ipf1/pdx <dig> null mutant mice. alike the ipf1/pdx1-/- mice the pancreatic program is initiated in fgf10-/- mice, i.e. the evagination of the pancreatic buds occur, but the subsequent proliferation and branching of the pancreatic epithelium is perturbed  <cit> . moreover, mice lacking the fgf <dig> receptor, fgfr2iiib, display a pancreatic growth defect with impaired branching and morphogenesis of the ductal epithelium.  <cit> . moreover, forced expression of fgf <dig> in the developing pancreatic epithelium results in pancreatic hyperplasia, adding further evidence for a role for fgf10-fgfr2iiib signaling in pancreatic progenitor cell proliferation  <cit> .

taken together, the almost identical pancreatic phenotype observed in mice lacking either ipf1/pdx <dig>  the receptor fgfr2iiib, or fgf <dig>  and the reduced pancreatic expression of fgfr2iiib in ipf1/pdx1-/- embryos provide evidence for a role for ipf1/pdx <dig> in regulating fgf signaling in the developing pancreatic epithelium. thus, ipf1/pdx <dig> appears to regulate pancreatic growth by ensuring high level expression of fgfr2iiib in pancreatic progenitor cells. interestingly, ipf1/pdx <dig> has also been shown to regulate the expression of another fgf-receptor, fgfr1c, in adult β-cells thereby ensuring normal β-cell function and glucose homeostasis  <cit> .

epidermal growth factor  signaling has also been linked to pancreatic growth and development  <cit> . several egf receptors, including erbb <dig>  have been shown to be expressed in the developing pancreatic epithelium  <cit> . in addition, erbb <dig> has been described to be expressed in the pancreatic mesenchyme  <cit> . mice lacking a functional erbb1/egfr gene have mildly perturbed pancreatic growth  <cit>  and mice lacking a functional erbb <dig> gene present with pancreatic hypoplasia  <cit> . additional support for a role of the egf family in pancreas development originates from in vitro studies in which egf was shown to stimulate the growth of e <dig>  rat pancreatic epithelium that had been depleted of mesenchyme  <cit> . thus, in addition to the reduced expression of fgfr2iiib in progenitor cells of ipf1/pdx <dig> deficient mice the reduced expression of erbb <dig> is likely to contribute to the perturbed pancreatic development that these mice present with.

ptf1a/p <dig> expression is severely reduced in ipf1/pdx <dig> null mutant mice, providing evidence that ptf1a/p <dig>  directly or indirectly, is a downstream target gene of ipf1/pdx <dig>  in support of a role for ipf1/pdx <dig> in regulating ptf1a/p <dig> expression, inactivation of the ipf1/pdx <dig> gene in the pancreatic epithelium at progressively later stages also results in reduced expression of ptf1a/p <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, kawaguchi et al. have shown that transgenic expression of ipf1/pdx <dig> under the control of the ptf1a/p <dig> promoter in an ipf1/pdx1-/- null background partially rescued the pancreatic developmental arrest  <cit> , suggesting that ptf1a/p <dig> expression is independent of ipf1/pdx <dig>  however, the ptf1a-ipf1/pdx <dig> transgenic rescue approach leaves open the possibility that the partially rescued phenotype is the result of leaky transgene expression due to positional integration effects and/or transgene copy number. moreover, since the hsp <dig> minimal promoter was coupled to the ptf1a/p <dig> promoter in the transgenic rescue approach, the transgene expression may differ from that of the endogenous ptf1a/p <dig> promoter.

alike ipf1/pdx <dig>  nkx <dig>  is expressed in pancreatic progenitors from embryonic day  <dig>  and thereafter the expression of nkx <dig>  also becomes restricted to mature β-cells. nkx <dig>  has previously been identified as a downstream target gene of ipf1/pdx1; β-cell specific inactivation of the ipf1/pdx <dig> gene resulted in a loss of nkx <dig>  expression in β-cells  <cit>  and in agreement with previous findings  <cit>  we show that nkx <dig>  expression is abolished also in pancreatic progenitor cells of ipf1/pdx <dig> null mutant mice. these data provide strong evidence that ipf1/pdx <dig> act upstream of nkx <dig>  in both pancreatic progenitor cells and adult β-cells.

f-spondin, encoded by spon <dig>  is a  <dig> kda extracellular matrix protein that has been reported to play an important role in proliferation and growth of vascular smc during ovarian growth and development  <cit> . f-spondin has also been showed to promote neurite outgrowth from spinal chord, hippocampal, and sensory neurons  <cit> . other reports describe a role for f-spondin in the development of the nervous system where it is predominately expressed during early stages of development but down-regulated during neural differentiation  <cit> . f-spondin has also been suggested to promote differentiation of neural precursor cells to nerve cell-like cells  <cit> . interestingly, a f-spondin related protein, r-spondin, has been shown to function as a growth factor; injection of r-spondin in mice resulted in an increased proliferation of intestinal crypt epithelial cells in both the small intestine and colon  <cit> . similar to the transient expression of spon <dig> in the developing nervous system, spon <dig> is transiently expressed, from e <dig>  to e <dig>  in progenitor cells of the developing pancreas. thus, spon <dig> expression in the developing pancreas overlaps with the phase of pancreatic progenitor cell proliferation. whether f-spondin is involved in regulation of proliferation and/or differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells will have to be determined by functional analyses in vitro and/or in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data show that ipf1/pdx <dig>  directly or indirectly, regulates the expression of genes, such as ptf1a/p <dig>  fgfr2iiib, and erbb <dig>  implicated in pancreatic growth and differentiation, providing evidence that the perturbed expressions of these factors provide a mechanistic explanation for the pancreatic developmental arrest that ipf1/pdx1-/- mice present with. in addition we show that spon <dig>  which encodes an extracellular matrix protein, is expressed in the developing pancreas and that spon <dig> expression is down-regulated in ipf1/pdx1-/- embryos.
