BACKGROUND
the integron/gene cassette system is now known to be widely distributed amongst the bacteria and is a major contributor to the dispersal of genes by lateral gene transfer . the system can facilitate lgt by virtue of the fact that the integron encodes a site-specific recombination  system  <cit> . the targets for ssr are gene cassettes  <cit> . these are independently mobilizable units of dna, usually composed of a single gene bound by a recombination site, designated a 59-base element  or alternatively attc. the dna integrase catalysing ssr, inti, is encoded by the integron. this integrase recognises two families of recombination sites. the first of these is the cassette associated 59-be  <cit>  and the second is a site contained within the integron designated atti. inti can catalyze a reversible reaction by which gene cassettes can be inserted into, or excised from, an integron via recombination between the atti site and a 59-be or between two 59-be sites  <cit> . multiple recombination events are common. as a consequence, integrons are normally associated with arrays comprising multiple cassettes, which in some species of vibrio can number well in excess of a hundred  <cit> . gene cassettes do not normally include a promoter. instead, where it has been examined, transcription of cassette genes is driven by a promoter  located in the integron itself  <cit> . thus, the integron and gene cassettes comprise both a gene capture and gene expression system.

integrons were first identified in the context of multi-drug resistance. in this context, pathogenic bacteria are often resistant to many antibiotics as a consequence of possessing an integron that has captured several gene cassettes containing resistance genes  <cit> . these integrons recovered from clinical environments are often embedded in other types of mobile elements such as plasmids and transposons  <cit> . it is now clear however that integrons are also a common feature of the chromosomes of various bacteria, being found in the gamma-proteobacteria , beta-proteobacteria  and spirochaetes  . another notable feature of chromosomal integrons is the wide diversity of functions encoded by the genes found in their gene cassettes  <cit> . this, coupled with the observation that cassette arrays can be quite large, clearly hints at a system that can greatly impact on the adaptive potential of bacteria  <cit> . given that cassette associated genes are part of the gene pool that is lgt-associated and mobilizable, they also represent a community resource that can be shared between individuals  <cit> .

bacteria of the vibrio genus are rapidly becoming a model system for the study of the chromosomal integron/gene cassette system  <cit> . as noted above, their cassette arrays are characteristically large, encompassing several percent of genomic coding capacity in many cases. representatives of this genus display such a high level of variation in terms genome size and content that "species" units can rarely be identified by the sequencing of one or a few genetic markers  <cit> . many complete integron arrays have now been assembled from various species of vibrio as a result of whole genome sequencing initiatives. these include v. cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus, v. vulnificus  and v. fischeri  <cit> . these collective sequencing efforts have helped to highlight the enormous amount of novel genetic diversity contained within integron arrays. however, it is also becoming clear that whole genome sequencing is a relatively blunt instrument for assessing gene cassette diversity. this is because, although individual strains of vibrio can contain large arrays, the total number of cassettes harboured by any single individual is very small compared to the overall size of this community resource  <cit> . as an alternative approach to recovering gene cassettes, the cassette pcr technique has been developed  <cit> . this method selectively amplifies gene cassettes to the exclusion of other genomic sequences and can be applied to both metagenomic  dna and to the dna of defined strains. however, cassette pcr only recovers cassettes in isolation  and cannot aid in the assembly of contiguous arrays. also, although gene cassette pcr is selective, there is always the possibility for some false positives   <cit> . when a gene cassette is found within an array, there is no doubt about its nature.

to more rapidly access and analyse the mobile gene cassette pool, we adopted a genomics approach that allows us to specifically isolate dna fragments containing large integron gene cassette arrays and exclude the vast majority of the genome that is common to most members of a species. no such large cassette array has previously been isolated and fully sequenced without completely sequencing the genome of its host. using our streamlined approach, we isolate and sequence the integron from a close relative of the widespread marine bacterium vibrio harveyi, a well-known member of the core vibrio group to which v. parahaemolyticus also belongs . to place it in an evolutionary context, we compare it to known vibrio integron arrays and perform a phylogenetic analysis of all of its components . this reveals strong interaction between vibrio integrons through lgt, high variability of array contents and wide functional diversity of gene cassettes. these analyses also yield insights on the processes of gene cassette recruitment from non-mobile genes and the possibility of cassette de-recruitment. differences in the genomic context of integrons from various vibrios suggest several events of intragenomic translocation for these genetic elements.

RESULTS
characterization of the vibrio sp. dat <dig> cassette array
the method used to isolate a complete vibrio gene cassette array takes advantage of the fact that cassettes are linked, having been assembled at a single locus, the integron atti site. by making genomic libraries and screening individual clones by cassette pcr or with pcr primers targeting the inti gene, we can recover large inserts that comprise exclusively, or in large part, of contiguous arrays of mobile gene cassettes. here we demonstrate this principle on an environmental strain of a vibrio sp. from an aquaculture facility in darwin, australia. we show that using a fosmid vector  to construct a genomic library , we can recover the whole  <dig> kb integron array in four pcr screening rounds, the first of which identifies a clone bearing the inti. a structured query language  script was developed to facilitate annotation of integron arrays, made difficult by the presence of non-coding elements such as 59-be sites. the script performs a search for short dna motifs on a dna segment and detects intervening orfs, outputting annotation in genbank format.

the gene cassette array of vibrio sp. isolate dat <dig> has an average g+c content of  <dig> %, compared to  <dig> % for the flanking dna regions. a g+c content lower than the genomic average of the host is typical of vibrio integrons, and differences ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % can be found in completely sequenced vibrio genomes harbouring an integron . the dat <dig> array contains  <dig> gene cassettes , falling between the shortest vibrio array of  <dig> cassettes  and the longest array of  <dig> cassettes  . however, dat <dig> contains a high diversity of cassettes, comprising  <dig> different cassette types out of a total of  <dig> cassettes. a cassette type represents either a non-paralogous cassette or a group of paralogous cassettes, the latter being defined as a group of cassette that have reciprocal blastp or blastn matches with an e-value of 1e- <dig> or less). this number of different cassette types is only equalled or surpassed by much larger arrays . consistent with this cassette diversity, the dat <dig> array also encodes a wide variety of functions including dna modification and primary metabolic enzymes . also typical of gene cassette arrays, there is a high proportion of cassettes either with no detectable homolog  or with sequence matches only to hypothetical proteins . only a minority of cassettes encodes a protein to which a putative function can be assigned:  <dig> cassettes can be assigned a specific function with reasonable certainty and another  <dig> a broad function .

interestingly, vibrio gene cassette arrays vary enormously in the proportions of their contents which is composed of non-coding cassettes. cassettes are defined as "non-coding" when they have no blastx matches and they do not contain orfs longer than  <dig> bp. given this definition, the proportion of the array made-up of non-coding cassettes can vary from 6%  to 49%  and does not appear to be correlated with array size. there seems to be some correlation, however, between array size and content in paralogous  cassettes, as all large arrays  have in excess of 44% of cassettes repeated at least twice in the array while smaller arrays all have around 25% of paralogs .

one remarkable feature of non-coding cassettes is that they either have very close homolog in other vibrios  or no homologs at all. in the vibrio sp. dat <dig> array, of  <dig> non-coding cassettes,  <dig> have no significant blastn hits and  <dig> are closely related to non-coding cassettes from other vibrios. none of these cassettes seem to represent pseudo-genes, as they do not display any matches to public databases using amino acid translations of all possible reading frames as query . furthermore, all cassettes defined as non-coding that do have blastn matches in other vibrios are similar to these homologs across their whole length. non-coding cassettes also tend to be paralogous in all vibrio integrons. although there are only  <dig> copies of the most prevalent non-coding cassette in the vibrio sp. dat <dig> array, there is a highly paralogous family of non-coding cassettes which has  <dig> representatives in v. vulnificus cmcp <dig> and  <dig> in v. vulnificus yj <dig> 

coding cassettes are also frequently paralogous . for example, they account for  <dig> out of the  <dig> paralogous cassettes in the dat <dig> array. the v. cholerae array displays the most paralogy among coding cassettes, boasting  <dig> proteins with some degree of paralogy. however, only two of its paralogous groups have more than  <dig> members, even when a generous blastp similarity cut-off is used to determine paralogy . coding cassettes differ most significantly from non-coding cassettes by having homologs both inside and outside of the vibrios. out of  <dig> coding cassettes in the vibrio sp. dat <dig> array,  <dig> have no blastp or blastx hit ,  <dig> have a best match to other vibrios and  <dig> have a best match outside vibrios.

variability of gene cassette array composition
comparison of cassette content between vibrio strains/species arrays reveals important variability. the number of cassettes shared between the arrays of two different species of vibrio, counting repeated paralogous cassettes only once, varies between  <dig> and  <dig>  . the two v. vulnificus strains, respectively containing  <dig> and  <dig> cassette types, only have  <dig> cassettes in common. this represents a 30–39% shared content , which is much lower than the 78–85% shared gene content of their whole genomes when compared with the same homology criteria . the difference in shared gene content between arrays and genomes is even more pronounced when comparing different species. for example, v. vulnificus cmcp <dig> shares 60–72% of its genomic genes with v. cholerae but only 10–15% of its array genes.

origins and fates of gene cassettes
there are multiple examples of cassette-encoded vibrio genes only found in a single vibrio strain but showing strong similarity to chromosomal genes from other types of bacteria. two striking examples are the proteins coded by cassettes  <dig> and  <dig> from the dat <dig> array. cassette  <dig> encodes a putative dna topoisomerase that has 68% amino acid identity to a similarly annotated protein from shewanella amazonensis . the cassette  <dig> protein also shares 40% identity with proteins coded by uncultured marine alpha-proteobacteria from the sar <dig> cluster. the protein coded by cassette  <dig> shares 55% identity  with selenocysteine lyase from the cyanobacteria anabaena variabilis yet does not display homology to any other protein in current databases. another notable case is the hypothetical protein encoded by cassette  <dig>  whose only homologs are found in two salmonella and two bordetella species, with which it shares ~50% amino acid identity. it is not possible to perform meaningful phylogenetic analyses of these genes to get a more complete picture of their evolutionary history, as there are not enough known homologs. however, the high degree of similarity between these cassettes and their non-cassette homologs, combined with the lack of any vibrio homologs, suggest that they have been recruited from chromosomal genes of other types of bacteria.

vibrio cassette-encoded orfs are also found to have non-cassette orfs homologs in other vibrio strains. the three most striking cases from the dat <dig> array are cassettes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cassette  <dig> codes for a putative beta-phosphoglucomutase that has 70% amino acid identity with a non-cassette orf occuring in both v. vulnificus genomes, as well as more distant homologs in a variety of other bacteria . cassette  <dig>  codes for a haemagglutinin associated protein and shares 88% amino acid identity with a v. cholerae cassette-encoded homolog. this cassette product also has 75% identity with a non-cassette protein found in v. parahaemolyticus and photobacterium profundum. cassette  <dig>  encodes a putative acetyltransferase that shares 76% identity with a non-cassette orf in v. fischeri, and is additionally found in many other bacteria. no traces of 59-be site can be found next to the non-cassette homologs, and it is unclear wether these vibrio non-cassette orfs closely related to cassette-encoded orfs represent cassette generation events or non-specific cassette insertion events. the latter scenario of cassette insertion outside an integron context has been previously documented for gene cassettes generally associated with class  <dig> integrons  <cit> . the nature of this secondary site insertion appears to generate a non-functional 59-be thereby preventing subsequent mobilization  <cit> .

there is one clear-cut example of cassette insertion outside an integron emerging from the analysis of the dat <dig> array. cassette  <dig> encodes two short proteins together forming a toxin-antitoxin stability system widespread in vibrio integrons  <cit>  . the amino acid sequence of the antitoxin protein from dat <dig> is 92% identical to its non-cassette homolog in shewanella oneidensis and but only 78% identical to its relative encoded by a cassette in the sequenced v. fischeri array. this dat <dig> cassette-encoded protein also shares significant similarity to a xanthomonas non-cassette homolog . it seems likely in this case that a vibrio gene cassette has been inserted non-specifically in the s. oneidensis genome, since the shewanella homolog clusters strongly inside a clade of vibrio cassette-encoded homologs. although shewanella oneidensis is known to possess a functional integron, it only harbours  <dig> cassettes and the vibrio-like antitoxin gene is found at a different chromosomal location .

non-coding cassettes differ from those that are coding in terms of distribution, as no homologs outside the vibrios can be found for these cassettes. instead, closely related homologs in other vibrio species and frequent paralogs in the same array are found for most non-coding cassettes. for example, non-coding cassette  <dig> is 84% and 88% identical to paralogous cassettes  <dig> and  <dig> at the nucleotide level and shares 89% identity with homologous non-coding v. parahaemolyticus and v. vulnificus cassettes. this high level of sequence conservation from one species to another suggests that non-coding cassettes are under purifying selection. the degree of sequence conservation of paralogous non-coding cassettes could also be enhanced by a process of gene conversion, where recombination between paralogs leads to a more homogeneous set of gene sequences  <cit> . this sequence conservation, linked with their limited distribution and frequent paralogy leads to two possibilities: 1) they could be selfish elements associated with vibrio integrons; 2) they have a function beneficial to the integron . in either case, they most likely have originated within the vibrios and spread to most representatives of this group harbouring integrons.

translocation of integron gene cassette arrays
the genomic context of an integron and its associated cassette array can provide important information on its history. the context of the vibrio sp. dat <dig> cassette array differs significantly from the context of its closest sequenced relative, the v. parahaemolyticus array. although the same  <dig> genes  are found 5' of the integrase gene in both arrays, the context suddenly changes past this conserved block. none of the next  <dig> genes upstream of this block in dat <dig> has a homolog in a nearby location in v. parahaemolyticus, some of them are found  <dig>  mb away on the large v. parahaemolyticus chromosome and two of them match genes found some  <dig> kb after the end of the array. similarly, genes found after the end of these two arrays are completely different, with the exception of homologous transposase genes  being found near the last cassette of both arrays. as suggested by rowe-magnus et al.  <cit> , the fact that the core vibrio group  integron integrases are flanked by a different gene than their v. cholerae and v. vulnificus homologs most likely represents an integron translocation event in the ancestor of the former group . it therefore seems that an integron was inserted at a given location  in the ancestor of the v. harveyi / v. parahaemolyticus core vibrio group, and that the array might have then been moved by a transposition or genome rearrangement event. however, since we do not know the degree of synteny  between the v. parahaemolyticus and vibrio sp. dat  <dig> genomes, the possibility that the genome of either of these strains was rearranged on both side of its integron cannot be excluded.

translocation events like the potential integron movement in the v. parahaemolyticus and/or vibrio sp. dat <dig> lineage seem likely, as the v. cholerae integron has certainly been moved from its original position on the large chromosome, being the only vibrio integron found on the smaller of the two chromosomes typically found in this genus  <cit> . as is the case for the arrays of vibrio sp. dat <dig> and v. parahaemolyticus, the block of genes flanking the integron integrase gene is conserved between v. cholerae and v. vulnificus , with entirely different contexts beyond this block. this block of genes would have accompanied the integron when it was translocated from one v. cholerae chromosome to the other. transposases could have been involved, as the v. cholerae integron  is flanked by genes coding for such proteins on both sides.

those translocation events do not seem to occur solely within and between chromosomes. vibrio salmonicida carries a large  <dig> mda plasmid  harbouring an integron  <cit> . the integrase of the prsv <dig> integron is clearly a vibrio-type integrase, not one of the class  <dig> or sxt constin integron integrases previously found on vibrio plasmids. this is shown by its strongly supported clustering with vibrio-type integrases in phylogenetic analyses . one of the gene cassettes of this integron encodes a transposase and another a dihydrofolate reductase type i usually found in class  <dig> integrons. it therefore seems that the v. salmonicida integron originates from a translocation  event of a chromosomal vibrio-type integron to a plasmid and later acquired cassettes from class  <dig> integrons.

the frequent association of vibrio integrons with transposases, along with the variability in their genetic context and the dna molecule carrying them , suggest that some of them could be mobilized. as discussed above, there is strong evidence for intragenomic and intracellular translocation of integrons, but what remains to be established is whether lateral transfer of whole gene cassette arrays between strains and species can occur.

gene cassette transfers within and between vibrio species
to examine the movement of gene cassettes between strains and species, we extracted and aligned all 59-be sites from the vibrio cassette arrays of vibrio sp. dat <dig>  v. parahaemolyticus rimd <dig>  v. cholerae n <dig>  v. vulnificus yj <dig>  v. vulnificus cmcp <dig> and v. fischeri es <dig>  figure  <dig> presents the phylogenetic analysis of 59-be based on this alignment. three major clades emerge in the resulting tree: 1) all v. fischeri 59-be sites cluster together to the exclusion of all others with strong statistical support ; 2) most  v. cholerae 59-be sites fall in a single clade along with four 59-be sites from other species with robust support ; 3) a large proportion  of 59-be sites from either of the two v. vulnificus strains form a cluster with a single 59-be site from v. parahaemolyticus . the vast majority of clusters beside these three are formed of 59-be sites from a variety of species.

the major clades observed for v. fischeri, v. cholerae and v. vulnificus contrast with the absence of such phylogenetic structuring for v. parahaemolyticus or vibrio sp. dat <dig>  the presence/absence of species-specific clades in the 59-be sites tree seems to be correlated with the phylogenetic distance of a species from others represented the dataset. in the most phylogenetically distant species of the dataset, v. fischeri, no exchange of 59-be sites with other species  is observed. v. vulnificus and v. cholerae also lack close relatives in the dataset, both being represented by relatively long branches in the rpob tree . they both display one major species-specific clade along with some exchange of 59-be sites with other species. vibrio sp. dat <dig> and vibrio parahaemolyticus are relatively close species  and neither of them displays a species-specific clade in the 59-be site tree.

of  <dig> nodes with a bootstrap support value >80%,  <dig> contain only 59-be sites from the same species and  <dig> contain 59-be sites from multiple species, indicating transfer of gene cassettes between species. all species of vibrio are involved in such transfers except for the more phylogenetically distant v. fischeri . among the  <dig> well-supported nodes containing 59-be from a single species only,  <dig> nodes contain 59-be sites solely from v. vulnificus. of these  <dig>   <dig> contain 59-be sites from a single strain and  <dig> contain 59-be sites from both cmcp <dig> and yj <dig>  transfer of gene cassettes can therefore be assumed to happen at both the subspecies and species levels among vibrios. the frequency of such transfer events seems to be broadly correlated with phylogenetic distance between the proponents . comparison of closely related vibrios, such as vibrio sp. dat <dig> and v. parahaemolyticus or individual strains of v. vulnificus, shows evidence of frequent transfer events that disrupt vertical inheritance patterns, ultimately leading to the absence of a major monophyletic clade for their 59-be sites. at the other extreme, transfer of cassettes between v. fischeri and other vibrios must be very rare or absent, as illustrated by the monophyly of all of its 59-be sites.

a phenomenon that could contribute to enhancing the degree of homogeneity between the 59-be sites found in a given species is gene conversion. this non-reciprocal recombination process occurs between relatively small tracts of dna and is known to lead to the sequence homogenization of multiple paralogous genes found in a given organism, such as rrna genes  <cit> . this could also be the case with 59-be sites, and linked with the process of nucleotide substitutions due to replication or repair errors, could lead to the creation and maintenance of distinct pools of 59-be sites in divergent organisms.

evolutionary rate of gene cassette arrays
mixed phylogenetic clades composed of 59-be sites from different vibrio species, observed with v. cholerae and v. metschnikovii by rowe-magnus et al.  <cit>  and here with a more substantial dataset, suggest frequent transfer of gene cassettes between vibrios. however, the phylogenetic structure present in the 59-be site tree, where 59-be sites from a given species cluster more frequently with others sharing a similar host, also suggest a correlation between phylogenetic distance and frequency of cassette exchange. this could be due to a lower efficiency of integrons at integrating gene cassettes from divergent species, as their 59-be sites did not co-evolve with the integrase and atti site of the host species. this hypothesis is supported by the recent findings of biskri et al.  <cit>  that the range of 59-be sites efficiently recombined by the v. cholerae integrase is narrower than the range of 59-be sites efficiently recombined by class  <dig> integrases. performing similar assays of recombination efficiency using combinations of 59-be sites, atti sites and integrases from different vibrio species could allow direct testing of a correlation between phylogenetic distance and frequency of cassette exchange in vibrios.

looking at the difference between two gene cassette arrays relative to their genomic context can yield insight on the rate of evolution of those arrays versus the rate at which the rest of the genome evolves. the two most closely related strains of vibrio for which we have complete array sequences, v. vulnificus yj <dig> and v. vulnificus cmcp <dig>  share 30–39% of their gene cassettes . this represents a minimum of  <dig> gene cassette gain/loss events between the arrays . this divergence is striking, as these strains are very closely related, displaying differences of only  <dig> bp in the  <dig> bp of their inti genes and  <dig> bp in a  <dig> bp fragment of their rpob gene. furthermore, the shared content of the array is also misleading for the estimation of cassette gain/loss events, as shared cassettes do not necessarily represent an evolutionarily conserved trait, but can have different histories, as is suggested by the lack of conservation in gene order between the arrays as opposed to the relatively conserved organization of the surrounding genomic genes  <cit> . given that the impact of acquiring/losing a gene on organismal fitness would generally be greater than that of a nucleotide substitution, integrons are of immense evolutionary value for their host. comparison of the cassette content of integrons from a large number of closely related strains, combined with a multi-locus sequence analysis to estimate the nucleotide substitution rate in the genome of these strains, could allow for a quantitative estimate of the relative evolutionary rate of integrons.

CONCLUSIONS
the entire  <dig> kb integron gene cassette array of vibrio sp. dat <dig> was isolated and sequenced using a streamlined approach that could be used with most, if not all, integron-containing bacteria . the ease of preparation and high efficiency of fosmid libraries combined with the possibility to screen for integrons by pcr , makes this approach widely applicable. non-coding genetic elements such as 59-be sites are not readily identified by automated genome annotation tools, which focus mostly on identifying orfs. even for the identification of orfs encoded within gene cassette arrays, these programs perform poorly, as they often identify the 59-be sites as being part of gene cassette orfs or being orfs themselves. this is in part due to the frequent use of alternative start codons in gene cassette encoded orfs  <cit> . the approach implemented here, a simple motif search for the conserved ends of 59-be sites identifies gene cassettes with almost 100% efficiency, provided that sequence information is available from gene cassettes of an integron belonging to the same class as the target. by searching for the 59-be sites first and subsequently identifying orfs that fall in-between these elements , the accuracy of the annotation is improved significantly.

although the mechanistic aspects of integrons are now relatively well understood , little is known on their general biology, such as the size range of their gene cassette arrays, the composition and diversity of their genetic pool and their rate of evolution. isolating and comparing gene cassette arrays from multiple closely related organisms is necessary to understand their role in natural environments. because of the almost ubiquitous presence of large integron gene cassette arrays in vibrios and the wide distribution and ease of isolation of these bacteria, they represent an ideal model system to study this genetic element and its impact on natural populations. the comparative analyses performed here confirm previous studies as to the functional diversity contained in vibrio integrons as well as the high variability of their gene cassette content  <cit> . additionally, evolutionary analyses of the gene cassettes of the vibrio sp. dat <dig> array revealed that these mobile elements can be recruited from genomic genes of various origins and can also be de-recruited, becoming a 'sedentary' gene after a non-specific integration event and the loss of its associated 59-be sites. this suggests a two-way interaction between the gene pool made up of gene cassettes and the larger gene pool composed of non-mobile bacterial genes. our phylogenetic analysis of 59-be sites suggests that the gene cassette pool itself is fragmented along phylogenetic lines. the 59-be sites linked to gene cassettes are not homogeneous across all vibrios but tend to be more similar if found in closely related strains or species, suggesting more frequent transfers of gene cassettes among close relatives. accumulation of sequence data on complete gene cassette arrays will allow for more precise estimates of the rates of gain, loss and transfer of gene cassettes and perhaps even on the degree of gene order conservation, provided that the arrays of very closely related organisms can be isolated.
