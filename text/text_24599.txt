BACKGROUND
the molecular basis of red, anthocyanin-derived, colour is one of the most studied traits in model plant species  <cit> , partly because of the abundance and ease of visual screens for phenotypic mutations. moreover, the structural genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, and the genes regulating this pathway, have been well described  <cit> . dna polymorphisms located in sequences of both biosynthetic and regulatory genes have been reported to co-segregate with red colour phenotype in several plant species. for instance, within the solanaceae family, candidate genes underlying red colour phenotypes were identified, through sequence similarity, to functionally characterised genes from tomato and petunia  <cit> . the a locus that controls anthocyanin accumulation in the foliage, flower and young fruits of pepper was found to co-segregate with a r2r <dig> myb transcription factor . the potato p, r and i loci were identified as being a flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase, a dihydroflavonol 4-reductase and a myb tf, respectively  <cit> . similar findings were also reported in cereals, where another myb tf was shown to control red grain colour  <cit> . more recently, the allelic diversity within a segregating population of arabidopsis thaliana showed linkage between an atmyb <dig> allele and the sucrose-induced accumulation of anthocyanin  <cit> . in antirrhinum  <cit> , petunia and maize  <cit> , allelic diversity of certain myb genes are key determinants in the inheritance and segregation of altered anthocyanin distribution.

altered expression of several genes with sequence similarity to anthocyanin biosynthetic genes has been associated with red skin colour in apple   <cit> , and a gene with sequence similarity to the myb-class of transcription factors, known to regulate the biosynthetic steps in anthocyanin metabolism, has been described and functionally characterised  <cit> . an r2r <dig> myb tf named mdmyb <dig> showed high levels of expression in red-fleshed fruit and induced red colour when transiently infiltrated into tobacco leaves. red foliage was also observed when a cdna of the mdmyb <dig> was over-expressed in transgenic 'royal gala' apple. recently, a gene with over 99% sequence identity to mdmyb <dig>  was shown to co-segregate with fruit skin colour in a population of  <dig> plants  <cit> , demonstrating that allelic variation of mdmyb10-like genes are associated with alleles that influence anthocyanin distribution.

the availability of an expressed sequence tag  dataset for apple  <cit>  made it possible in this study to identify candidates with high sequence similarity to functionally characterised genes  found in model species. microsatellites and sequence variations corresponding to single nucleotide polymorphisms  are often encountered in contigs assembled from est datasets, as have been shown in several crop species where large est datasets are available  <cit> . mapping molecular markers located within, or proximal to, candidate genes for which both the function and expression are known is very attractive, and can lead to the identification of the gene controlling the trait of interest.

while there are reports on the chemical components of red colour in apple  <cit> , few studies assessing the genetic control of this trait have been published. lewis and crane  <cit>  concluded that red foliage colour was controlled by a single major dominant gene, trebuschenko  <cit>  suggested that foliage colour was controlled by two genes. similarly, the genetic control of fruit skin colour has been debated. red colouration in the skin was suggested to be controlled by either two dominant genes a and b, with a linked in coupling phase with a third gene, l, controlling the degree of blush  <cit> , or by a single locus rf  <cit> . a molecular marker linked to the rf locus controlling skin colour has been developed  <cit>  and was mapped to lg  <dig>  <cit> . mendelian loci controlling colour have been characterized in other rosaceous tree crops in the prunus genus  <cit> . natural red leaf mutants of pear are also thought to be regulated by a single dominant gene  <cit> .

apple cultivars present a wide range of colour variation in the fruit skin, from green such as 'granny smith', through to partially coloured apples, such as 'royal gala'  or 'sciros'  , through to dark red such as 'red delicious'. red colour varies not only in the fruit skin, but also in other plant parts such as flowers, foliage, woody organs and fruit flesh. red flesh colour is a highly desirable trait: consumer studies have shown that there may be a premium for fruit with novel colour distribution  <cit> . in addition to a high fresh fruit market value, red pigments, which are mainly anthocyanins  <cit> , represent an excellent source of antioxidants, with potential health benefits  <cit> . although all the most popular commercial apple varieties have white flesh, some named varieties, such as 'pink pearl' and 'weirouge' show varying levels of red pigmentation in their flesh  <cit> . pigmentation in red flesh may be associated with poor quality of high astringency, small fruit size and soft texture, such as found in crab apples . one of the objectives of our apple breeding programme is to introduce the red flesh trait into high quality commercial cultivars. the development of cultivars with commercial potential can be accelerated using marker-assisted selection . for this purpose, it is very useful to understand the genetic basis and segregation of red pigmentation in apple flesh.

our goal was to identify markers in candidate genes and test them for co-segregation with the red flesh phenotype, using segregating populations. for most of the candidate genes present in our database, we were able to identify variable dna sequence features that enabled us to locate them on the apple genetic map. we were able to support the data that myb10-like genes play key roles in the molecular determination of anthocyanin distribution and demonstrate that the myb <dig> gene is associated with an allele responsible for red flesh and foliage in apple.

RESULTS
phenotypic segregation for red colour
two populations were assessed for colour in the fruit core and cortex. in the a <dig> family , of the  <dig> fruiting individuals,  <dig> plants bore fruit with red core and cortex. a proportion of the population  exhibited a red cortex/white core phenotype, and the remaining  <dig> plants were completely white-fleshed. these results were consistent in each of the three years of the study. in a second population, 'geneva' × 'braeburn',  <dig> of the progeny had fruits with red core and cortex, while the remaining  <dig> progeny that were phenotyped had white fruits, corresponding to a 1: <dig> mendelian ratio .

the foliage colour was assessed for  <dig> segregating apple seedling families  resulting from controlled pollination . the foliage colour segregation ratio for the pooled data was  <dig> : <dig>  , which is close to 1: <dig> . however, segregation ratios showed no clear trend across the  <dig> families analysed, nor across families with a common red-leafed father. approximation of the segregation ratios ranged from 1: <dig> for  <dig> families to 1: <dig> for another  <dig> families, and in one case  as high as 1: <dig>  always favouring green leaf.

the red-leafed  <dig>  b6- <dig>  nz-selection <dig>  nz-selection <dig>  nz-selection <dig> and 'geneva' all have malus pumila var. niedzwetzkyana in their pedigrees. 'geneva' is an open-pollinated seedling of malus pumila var. niedzwetzkyana, nz-selection <dig> and nz-selection <dig> are seedlings from a 'royal gala' × 'geneva' cross. nz-selection <dig> is a seedling of a  ×  <dig>  b6- <dig> cross. the origin of red foliage colour in  <dig>  k- <dig>   <dig>  d35- <dig> and  <dig>  j12- <dig> is unknown. the green-foliaged breeding parents nz-selection <dig>  nz-selection <dig>  nz-selection <dig>  nz-selection <dig>  nz-selection <dig>  and 'scigold' are from a 'royal gala' × 'braeburn' cross, nz-selection <dig> from a 'red delicious' ×  cross and nz-selection <dig> from a 'royal gala' × 'prima' cross. †: a <dig> population used for genetic map construction. χ <dig> test for segregation: * p =  <dig> ; *** p =  <dig> .

in both the a <dig> and the 'geneva' × 'braeburn' families, all the trees that bore red cored fruits had red leaves and a red cortex, while the plants that bore completely white-fleshed fruits were green-leafed. in the a <dig> population, the individuals that exhibited a white core/red cortex phenotype were green-leafed. all the red foliage parents used in the  <dig> populations bore red core fruit.

ssr and snp discovery
a total of  <dig>  apple est sequences, including those described by newcomb et al.  <cit> , and those deposited in the genbank database, were assembled into contigs and preliminary annotation performed by sequence homology . twelve out of the  <dig> candidate genes for colour  <cit>  were represented in the database . full cdna sequence of the remaining candidate, mdmyb <dig>  is described elsewhere  <cit> . for seven of the  <dig> candidate tf and biosynthetic genes, contigs were assembled from sequences obtained from more than eight cdna clones at a clustering threshold of 95%.

a snp detection tool identified a total of  <dig> snps within the seven genes with more than eight cdnas, over a cumulative sequence length of  <dig>  bp . this corresponds to a frequency of one snp every  <dig> bp. in the remaining five candidate genes, for which a contig was identified in the database, the number of sequences in each alignment ranged from two to five ests only  and was not sufficient to ensure authentic snp detection. for these, as well as for mdbhlh <dig> and mdmyb <dig>  cloning and sequencing of pcr fragments obtained from amplification of genomic dna from the parents 'sciros' and  <dig>  b6- <dig> resulted in detection of a further  <dig> snps in four genes of the set of five , from  <dig>  bp of intron and  <dig>  bp of exon sequences respectively, corresponding to a frequency of one snp every  <dig> bp. no snps could be detected in mdanl <dig>  two insertion-deletions  of four and  <dig> bp were detected for mdmyb <dig> intron and mdbhlh <dig> exon, respectively.

dinucleotide ssrs were detected in four out of  <dig> candidate genes. one was located in the 5' untranslated region  of mdbhlh <dig> and three were in the introns of mdmyb <dig>  mdmyb <dig> and mdmyb <dig> 

marker development and genetic mapping
although three of the four ssr markers were polymorphic in the population segregating for red flesh, none of them co-segregated with red colour. five out of seven snp markers were polymorphic between the parents of the population. the snp marker developed for mdchs gave a two-band monomorphic profile, suggesting the presence of another copy of the gene and that the snp was not allelic but because of a polymorphism between these two loci, this is perhaps not surprising given that the chalcone synthase has also been described as a gene family in species such as petunia  <cit>  and pea  <cit> . the snp marker developed from mdbhlh <dig> est sequence was monomorphic with a single amplification product, suggesting that this snp was not present in either of the parents of the cross analysed. one marker, developed from the four base pairs indel present in the mdmyb <dig> intron, produced a  <dig> bp pcr product which segregated in the a <dig> population and was only present in red fruit core/red-leafed individuals . none of the other markers exhibited co-segregation with red flesh . the marker developed from the mdmyb <dig> indel segregated in a 3: <dig> ratio , although the parental genotypes  and sequencing data  predicted a 1: <dig> ratio.

after screening the markers across the progeny of a 'm.9' × 'robusta 5' cross for which a genetic map is being constructed , we assigned a linkage group to five of the candidate genes . mddfr remained unlinked  and the remaining markers were monomorphic in this population. the mdmyb <dig> indel marker did not segregate in this progeny set, nor in three other mapping populations available to us . for that reason, ssrs markers from reference maps with defined linkage group locations were screened over the a <dig> population. because a red skin marker was located on lg  <dig>  <cit> , markers from this lg were screened first. four published ssrs, cn444524-ssr, hi23d <dig>  hi01d <dig>  <cit>  and gd <dig>  <cit> , and the mdmyb <dig> indel were screened over the whole a <dig> population and a genetic map of lg  <dig> was constructed for the parent  <dig>  b6- <dig> . linkage was detected between mdmyb <dig> and the lg  <dig> markers. mdmyb <dig> was located between hi01d <dig>  and nzms_cn <dig> . the use of transferable ssr markers made it possible to then align the genetic map developed in the a <dig> population with the published map of 'discovery'  <cit>  and to assign mdmyb <dig> to the bottom of lg  <dig> 

np: not polymorphic in the m. <dig> × 'robusta 5' population. ul: unlinked. lg: linkage group. the snp position in the allele-specific primer is underlined. extra mismatch in the allele-specific primer is shown in italics. no marker could be designed for mdanl <dig>  because neither snps nor ssrs were detected.

discussion
genetic determination of red flesh and foliage
out of  <dig> and  <dig> fruiting trees in the 'sciros' ×  <dig>  b6- <dig>  and 'geneva' × 'braeburn' populations, respectively, all the red core fruit were harvested from red foliage trees, indicating that those two characters may be controlled by the same  gene. in the a <dig> population, the segregation ratio of 1: <dig>  suggests that at least two dominant genes control both red foliage and red core. this appeared to be in agreement with the hypothesis of a two-gene model suggested by trebuschenko  <cit> . however, the absence of any recombinants between the marker for mdmyb <dig> and red foliage phenotype among  <dig> individuals suggests that there is actually only one gene controlling this character in the a <dig> family, consistent with the model purposed by lewis and crane  <cit> . the apparent segregation ratio of 1: <dig> in the a <dig> family, as well as the variable segregation patterns of foliar colour observed in all other  <dig> families  was also noted in some of trebuschenko's red-foliaged families  <cit> . this suggests that a distorted segregation prevalent in populations derived from red-foliaged parents may be responsible for the difference observed between phenotype and that predicted inheritance pattern from a dominant mdmyb <dig> allele. this is confirmed by the fact that the closest ssr marker  also showed a segregation distortion. however, it would be interesting to genotype the germplasm used by trebuschenko to make sure that there is not a second allele that can describe the inheritance observed.

segregation distortions have been noted previously in other apple mapping populations  <cit> . those involving the vf resistance gene in apple were inferred to be caused by the presence of several sub-lethal genes, some of which were closely linked to vf.  <cit> . the variable segregations in foliage and flesh colour observed amongst families in our study  was also found in families segregating for vf  <cit> . the reason for this variability is not understood but may occur because several sub-lethal genes are required in partnership for lethality to occur. as these can be supplied both by donor  and by the recurrent parent, their segregation in a family will depend upon their allelotype in each of the parents.

the lethality factor in vf families seems to be caused by dwarfing and poor vigour and eventual plant death. however, germination and survival rates of plants up to five weeks old were high  in our red foliage families assessed in  <dig> and similar to other green × green-leafed families growing at the same time . similarly, an earlier study concluded that germination rates were the same for green and red pigmented apple seed  <cit> . it is therefore unlikely that the distortions in inheritance of the foliage colour that occurred in our families resulted from a variable survival rates of the seeds planted. this suggests that the distortion linked with red foliage may be due to an effect at fertilisation or during seed formation.

as 'redfield', the grandparent of the population segregating for the presence of the red core and red foliage phenotype, is derived from the accession malus pumila var. niedzwetzkyana, we named this locus rni . we identify a second phenotype  carried by  <dig>  b6- <dig>  and propose that a second, independent allele controls the red cortex/white core, but further studies are required to determine its exact nature.

candidate gene mapping in apple
most of the previous mapping studies involving simply inherited or quantitative traits in apple have been carried out using anonymous markers, either bulked segregant analysis  <cit>  with rapd markers, whole genome scans using microsatellites  <cit> , or quantitative trait locus  analysis on saturated genetic maps  <cit> . our present study followed an alternative route that used the genomics tools newly developed for apple  <cit> . our approach is based on the mapping of candidate genes with sequence similarity to genes of known functions. this genomics approach has made it possible to build on the functional genomics that has taken place in model plants and provides a bridge between crop genomics and fruit breeding technologies.

we have identified a polymorphism located in mdmyb <dig> that co-segregates with the presence of red core colour in apple flesh and red foliage. this result, in combination with previous observations using expression studies and transformation in model systems  <cit> , strongly indicates that mdmyb <dig> is one gene controlling red colour in apple. we have also previously shown that up-regulation of the mdmyb <dig> gene is responsible for the elevated accumulation of anthocyanin in red-fleshed apples  <cit> . expression of mdmyb <dig> regulates the expression of the biosynthetic genes in the anthocyanin pathway; chs: chalcone synthase, chi: chalcone isomerase, f3h: flavonol  <dig> hydroxylase, dfr: dihydro flavonol reductase, ldox: leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase and ufgt: flavonoid 3-o-glucosyl transferase. indeed, these genes have been shown to follow the same expression pattern as mdmyb <dig> in red v. white flesh apple fruits  <cit> . snp markers developed for dfr and chs did not show any co-segregation with red colour indicating that while these genes may be necessary for anthocyanin biosynthesis, allelic variants are not responsible for the red-flesh phenotype under investigation. this phenotype could, however, be achieved either through an alteration in the regulation of the mdmyb <dig> gene or by an alteration in the expression of a closely linked gene that regulates mdmyb <dig>  demonstrating the co-segregation of mdmyb <dig> with the inheritance of the red fruit core phenotype suggests that the altered expression of the mdmyb <dig> is the result of a change either in the upstream regulatory region of mdmyb <dig>  elevating its expression in apple fruit, or in its rna secondary structure, altering the rna stability of the mdmyb <dig> transcript of the red-fleshed allele. although simply inherited traits are often due to a mutation in structural genes, mutations located in regulatory genes, such as tfs, can also account for qualitative variations in agronomic traits  <cit> . another interesting observation is the fact that the red foliage/red fruit core trees also produce red flowers, bark and wood, indicating that alteration in transcription or post-transcription of mdmyb <dig> has resulted in a regulatory effect that targets elevated levels of rna accumulation in the whole plant or in a constitutive manner.

bc <dig>  a marker linked to rf  <cit>  which controls skin colour in apple, was mapped to lg  <dig>  <cit> . unfortunately, bc <dig> was monomorphic in our a <dig> population and so could not be positioned on the same map as mdmyb <dig>  however, the fact that they are both located at the bottom of lg  <dig> suggests that rf and rni could be located in a gene cluster or even correspond to alleles of the same gene. a myb tf homologous to mdmyb <dig> and named mdmyb <dig> was recently characterized and was shown to co-segregate with skin colour in a population of  <dig> individuals from a cross between a sibling of 'cripp's pink' and 'golden delicious'  <cit> . further work is needed in order to ascertain whether mdmyb <dig> controls skin colour in apple, as well as foliage and fruit core. interestingly, fruit skin colour  and leaf colour  collocate in prunus  <cit> , which suggests there may be a region of synteny between the middle of prunus lg  <dig> and the bottom of malus lg  <dig>  the isolation and mapping of orthologues of mdmyb <dig> in other rosaceae, including prunus species, could help to validate the control of red colour and confirm the finding of a syntenic region.

although we did not identify any recombinants between rni and mdmyb <dig> in the a <dig> population, further work is needed to validate their complete co-segregation. preliminary validation results show that the mdmyb <dig> markers co-segregates with foliage colour in other mapping populations; however, family genetic mapping studies, even when using large segregating populations, cannot rule out linkage at a very close physical distance, because of the low probability of detecting a recombination at a small distance . therefore, this research has not completely ruled out that the gene underlying rni could be another gene physically closely linked to mdmyb <dig>  although our previous functional results  <cit>  make this less likely. a more effective way to test and validate the genetic control by mdmyb <dig> of red colour might be to use association studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we provide genetic proof that the presence of red flesh  and red foliage in apple can be determined by a unique single locus and we have named one allele controlling the red colour rni, on the basis of its origin from m. pumila var. niedzwetzkyana. a molecular marker derived from mdmyb <dig>  which is able to control red colour in apple, co-segregates with the rni locus that we have positioned on lg  <dig> of the apple genome, a region previously implicated in controlling red skin colour. a second gene controlling red cortex in the absence of red foliage remains to be identified, and based on the success of the present studies, we believe that the candidate gene approach would also be an appropriate route for the discovery the underlying molecular basis of this allele.
