BACKGROUND
mcpip has rnase activity that prevents some immune disorders by direct control of the stability of a set of inflammatory transcripts  <cit> . mcpip-deficient mice die within  <dig> weeks with the symptoms of severe inflammatory changes. among transcripts destabilized by mcpip are the mrnas for il- <dig>  il-12p <dig>  calcitonin receptorand and il-1β  <cit> . mcpip contains a pin domain, responsible for it's enzymatic activity and ccch zinc finger domain, partially also engaged in the control of transcripts decay  <cit> . mcpip is induced in human peripherial blood monocytes by monocyte chemoattractant protein  and this phenomenon resulted in the name of this protein as a mcp- <dig> inducible protein   <cit> . the significance of mcpip in the course of inflammation is manifested also in the development of cardiovascular diseases. elevated level of mcpip is associated with ischemic heart disease  <cit> . recently it was found that toll-like receptors are involved in the activation of mice zc3h12a . the activation of zc3h12a was revealed by microarray analysis of rna from macrophages of wild-type, myd88-/- and trif-/-mice stimulated with liposacharide   <cit> . we have observed that the level of transcript for mcpip is rapidly induced by il-1β in monocytes, fibroblasts and hepatoma hepg <dig> cells  <cit> . il-1β is a proinflammatory cytokine produced very early in response to multiple stress. it exerts pleiotropic effects on different cell types. binding of il-1β to il-1ri leads to activation of the kinase tak <dig>  which finally results in the activation of nfκb but also activation of map kinases   <cit> .

among different transcription factors phosphorylated by mapks are the ternary complex factors , the subfamily of ets-domain transcription factors  <cit> . the tcf subfamily include elk- <dig>  sap- <dig> and sap2/erp/net. these proteins form ternary complexes on target promoters together with mads-box protein, serum response factor . all tcfs share the ets-domain which is engaged in dna-binding, the b-box responsible for association with srf, the transcriptional-activation domain that can be phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues, and the docking domain which interacts with mapks  <cit> . elk- <dig> and sap- <dig> are thought to act as activators whereas sap- <dig> is thought to play mainly a repressive role. a series of events initiated by phosphorylation of transcription factors from the tcf subfamily are still under investigation. phosphorylation induces conformational changes and influences the interaction of transcription factors with other co-activators/co-repressors. the details of this process are quite well understood for elk- <dig>  phosphorylation leads to its de-repression through the reversing of its sumoylation and subsequent dissociation of hdac- <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylated elk- <dig> recruits mediator through the coactivator sur-2/med <dig> and interacts with p300/cbp which causes the enhancement of acetylation of histones of target promoters  <cit> . recently it was also shown that histone acetylation initiated by phoshorylation of elk- <dig> on the c-fos promoter leads to association of a second transcription factor, nfi, which in turn leads to the recruitment of the basal machinery and subsequent promoter activation  <cit> .

the mechanisms controlling the regulation of mcpip expression are largely unknown. here, we have shown that il-1β regulates expression of the gene coding for mcpip - zc3h12a through the activation of the erk pathway. we have found that elk- <dig> and srf are transcription factors engaged in this regulation.

RESULTS
il-1β regulates the expression of zc3h12a via activation of the nfkb and erk pathways
our data indicate that mcpip mrna level is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokine il-1β and that this regulation takes place through the activation of nfκb  <cit> . to test whether other pathways are engaged in the regulation of zc3h12a expression we have examined the stimulation of mcpip mrna synthesis in a hepg <dig> cell line with blocked nfκb activation . in this cell line nfκb is not activated by il-1β at all whereas in both wild-type hepg <dig> cells and mock cells there is a rapid activation of nfκb . in miκb cells il-1β still increases the mcpip mrna level although the fold of this stimulation is much weaker than in the control . phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  increases the effect of il-1β both in mock cells and in miκb cells. . these results suggest that il-1β regulates the expression of zc3h12a not only via activation of nfκb. in contrast to il-1β, pma stimulates the synthesis of mcpip transcript in both cell lines  in a comparable manner . we speculated that the possible pathway engaged in the observed stimulation of zc3h12a could be the mapk pathway. il-1β can activate the p <dig>  jnk and erk kinases which phosphorylate transcription factors  <cit> . we tested the involvement of one of them, namely erk. to examine the role of erk in the activation of zc3h12a expression we have used u <dig> - a known inhibitor of mek1/ <dig>  u <dig> inhibited the activation of zc3h12a by il-1β and pma in both mock and miκb cells . these observations suggest that besides nfκb activation pathway, the erk pathway is responsible for rapid activation of zc3h12a expression. erk is activated by il-1β in hepg <dig> cells and its phosphorylation is blocked when the erk inhibitor - u <dig> is present .

since mcpip plays a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation we decided to confirm the involvement of erk pathway in the regulation of il-1β stimulated zc3h12a expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages. in macrophages treated with il-1β the level of mcpip mrna was elevated and this effect was partially blocked by erk inhibitor - u <dig> . these data show that the observed mechanism of erk-dependent regulation of zc3h12a by il-1β is not restricted to hepg <dig> cells.

the zc3h12a promoter is regulated by the transcription factor elk-1
activation of the erk pathway leads to phosphorylation of elk- <dig>  to test the possible role of this transcription factor in the control of zc3h12a expression we carried out transient transfection assays with increasing amounts of a repressive elk- <dig> construct  or a constitutively active elk- <dig> fusion protein  and a  <dig> bp long fragment of human zc3h12a promoter  - pzc3h12a-luc. both elk-en and elk-vp <dig> regulated the activity of pzc3h12a-luc in a dose-dependent manner, with elk-vp <dig> activating and elk-en repressing as expected . to find sequences responsible for the observed regulation we have prepared a set of deletion mutants of the zc3h12a promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct. the shortest sequence which still was responsive to elk- <dig> in a dose-dependent manner turned out to be located between - <dig> bp and + <dig> bp, ps-zc3h12a-luc . bioinformatic analysis revealed that this  <dig> bp long fragment contains a hypothetical ets binding site  and a carg box - srf binding site . these experiments suggest that elk- <dig> can contribute to the regulation of zc3h12a expression. the presence of an ets binding site and a carg box sequence suggests that the observed effect is direct.

the sequence of the carg box present in the zc3h12a promoter differs form the canonical one . we therefore tested whether srf can bind to this sequence in vitro using a gel retardation assay. as a positive control we used a fragment of the c-fos promoter . srf bound to the c-fos promoter as expected and binding was also detected on the zc3h12a promoter fragment containing a wild type carg box, albeit to a lower level. in contrast, binding of srf to the zc3h12a promoter was not detected when the carg box was mutated . these observations demonstrate that srf can bind directly to the zc3h12a promoter, although we were unable to detect elk- <dig> binding in vitro .

to demonstrate that endogenous elk- <dig> and srf can bind to the zc3h12a promoter in vivo we carried out a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment in hepg <dig> cells. in the presence of elk- <dig> antibodies, the zc3h12a promoter was precipitated from formaldehyde cross-linked total cell lysates , whereas control antibodies precipitated background levels of the zc3h12a promoter . the promoter of zc3h12a was also precipitated in the presence of srf antibodies . il-1β stimulation had no effect on the association of either elk- <dig> or srf with the zc3h12a promoter . both elk- <dig> and srf were also detected as constitutively associated with the promoter of the well characterized target gene, an egr- <dig> . these observations demonstrate that endogenous elk- <dig> and srf bind to the zc3h12a promoter in vivo, thereby demonstrating that the regulatory effects of elk- <dig> and srf on zc3h12a expression are likely direct.

stimulation of hepg <dig> cells by il-1β leads to phosphorylation of elk-1
phosphorylation of elk- <dig> is crucial for its activity. to confirm that stimulation by il-1β induces the phosphorylation of elk- <dig> through mapk pathway we performed western blot analysis using an antibody against phosphorylated elk- <dig>  il-1β induced phosphorylation of elk- <dig> after 5- <dig> min of stimulation and this modification was blocked when the erk pathway inhibitor - u <dig> was present . therefore in hepg <dig> cells stimulation by il-1β causes phosphorylation of elk- <dig> through activation of erk.

elk- <dig> is bound to the promoters of genes independently of its activation by the mapk pathway  <cit> . the crucial factor which changes the state of the elk- <dig> on the promoters and induces events leading to activation of the genes regulated by this transcription factor is phosphorylation carried out by erk, jnk or p <dig>  to test whether active, phosphorylated forms of elk- <dig> could be detected on the zc3h12a promoter after il-1β stimulation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-phospho-elk- <dig>  antibody. phosphorylated elk- <dig> could be detected on the zc3h12a promoter after  <dig> min treatment with il-1β .

taken together, these results demonstrate that il-1β treatment leads to the increase of elk- <dig> phosphorylation in an erk pathway-dependent manner and the active phosphorylated form can be found associated with the zc3h12a promoter.

the zc3h12a promoter is regulated by il-1β via the erk mapk pathway
to verify the importance of the cloned  <dig> bp long promoter in the regulation of zc3h12a expression by il-1β we have examined its activation by this proinflammatory cytokine. the  <dig> bp long promoter was activated by il-1β and this activation was blocked by the erk pathway inhibitor - u <dig> . also pma activated this promoter and the combination of both factors had an even greater effect . these data are broadly in agreement with the data obtained by northern blot analysis . in all cases the erk inhibitor strongly reduced the observed activation. these results confirm the involvement of the erk pathway in the regulation of zc3h12a expression by il-1β and demonstrate the importance of the  <dig> bp long promoter sequence in this regulation.

functional analysis of ets binding site and carg box in the zc3h12a promoter
the sequence from the human zc3h12a promoter located between - <dig> bp and + <dig> bp contains an ets binding site and carg box, sequences which hypothetically can bind elk- <dig> and its partner srf. to evaluate the contribution of these sequences to the observed regulation by elk- <dig> and srf we introduced point mutations that abolished binding of elk- <dig> or srf to these elements. we first assessed the response of this mutant promoter to activation by il-1β. the responsiveness of the mutant zc3h12a promoter to il-1β was strongly reduced in comparison to a reporter construct containing the wild-type promoter sequence . however, the activation of the  <dig> bp promoter sequence, without a functional ets binding site and functional carg box, by il-1β was not completely blocked because this fragment still contains two nfκb binding sites . this data confirm the importance of the ets binding site and the carg box in the regulation of zc3h12a expression by il-1β.

to confirm that the mutant promoter was unresponsive to elk- <dig>  we examined its activation by the potent elk-vp <dig> fusion protein. in comparison to the wild-type promoter, the reporter construct containing the mutated ets binding site and the mutated carg box was not responsive to elk-vp <dig> . mutation of either the elk- <dig> or the srf binding sites was sufficient to abolish activation of the promoter by elk-vp <dig> . this is consistent with a requirement for srf to recruit elk- <dig> 

together these data therefore demonstrate the importance of the ets and srf binding elements in promoter responsiveness to elk- <dig> activity and activation by il-1β.

discussion
elk- <dig> is a known regulator of the expression of immediate-early genes, mainly transcription factors, which in turn regulate the expression of other genes coding for proteins engaged in the response of the cell to the changing environment. thus, activation of elk- <dig> is at the top of events leading to a global changes in the cell behavior. here we have identified a new elk- <dig> target gene, zc3h12a, that encodes a recently discovered protein whose biological function is the control of mrna turn-over. transcripts for il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and the calcitonin receptor are found to be regulated by mcpip  <cit>  and we have recently found that mcpip regulates the turn-over of il-1β mrna  <cit> . the latter finding is intriguing and suggests the existence of an autoregulatory loop as here we show the importance of il-1β in controlling the expression of zc3h12a. the results indicate the existence of a negative regulatory loop, contributing to shut down of il-1β synthesis.

the mechanisms controlling the regulation of the expression of zc3h12a are not known. zc3h12a is an immediate-early gene regulated by the proinflammatory cytokine il-1β  <cit>  through the activation of nfκb . however in the miκb cells with a defect in the activation of nfκb, il-1β is still able to elevate mcpip mrna level . our results suggest that apart from the nfκb activation pathway, the mapk pathway is also engaged in the regulation of zc3h12a expression. zc3h12a promoter deletion constructs allowed us to find a minimal promoter  <dig> bp fragment which is still responsive to mapk pathway activation. bioinformatic analysis revealed that this region contains a hypothetical elk- <dig> binding site  - caggaa. the sequences recognized by elk- <dig> differ amongst binding sites. the core gga is always included in the ets-binding site but the flanking residues may differ. the most frequent motif is ccggaa   <cit> . however, other known elk- <dig> target genes like c-fos possess the sequence caggat, whereas another one nur <dig>  contains the gaggaa motif  <cit> . elk- <dig> as a member of the tcf subfamily can form ternary complexes on target promoters together with serum response factor . indeed, there is a carg box, an srf binding site, in the  <dig> bp fragment of zc3h12a promoter . the consensus carg box sequence is cc6gg although there are exceptions from this rule. for example tr <dig> has cctgtatgg and nur <dig> ctatttatag  <cit> . the lack of one of the g:c base pairs flanking the central hexameric a/t rich region probably explains the lower level of binding we observe in comparison to the c-fos promoter, which contains a canonical binding motif. however, the relative in vitro binding affinity and match to the consensus does not necessarily correlate with in vivo occupancy level as demonstrated by chip-chip analysis  <cit> . indeed, we detect srf binding by chip analysis to this promoter. simultaneous mutation of both, the ets-binding site and carg box completely blocked activation of  <dig> bp promoter fragment by either a constitutively active form of elk- <dig>  or by pma treatment. activation of this fragment by il-1β is strongly reduced although not blocked completely and this remaining responsiveness to il-1β is probably due to two hypothetical nfkb binding sites still present in the  <dig> bp promoter fragment . all these results suggest involvement of the erk mapk pathway leading to activation of elk- <dig> in the regulation of zc3h12a expression by il-1β. indeed, we demonstrate binding of elk- <dig> to zc3h12a promoter in vivo through chip analysis. elk- <dig> binding to the zc3h12a promoter is detectable in the presence and absence of stimulation with il-1β, thus, changes in promoter occupancy does not appear to be the activation mechanism. binding of elk- <dig> to ets-binding sites of other genes in unstimulated cells was reported earlier  <cit> . such binding is not sufficient for activation of genes regulated by elk- <dig> since elk- <dig> in unstimulated cells is sumoylated and interacts with hdac- <dig>  this modification keeps elk- <dig> in a repressive form  <cit> . our data show that il-1β induces phosphorylation of elk- <dig> and phosphorylated elk- <dig> is present on the zc3h12a promoter . the elk- <dig> partner protein, srf, is also bound to the zc3h12a promoter and this binding is also not increased upon il-1β stimulation indicating again that transcription factor recruitment does not appear to be a key regulatory event . this seems to be a more general mechanism since the occupancy of egr- <dig> promoter by srf and elk- <dig> is also independent of il-1β stimulation. it has to be noticed that apart from the nfκb activation pathway and the erk pathway another yet unknown pathway contributes to the regulation of zc3h12a expression. in miκb cells treated with the erk inhibitor the activation of zc3h12a expression by il-1β is still observed . our preliminary data indicate that p <dig> and jnk could participate in this process.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results demonstrate a role of elk- <dig> in the regulation of the expression of mcpip - an rnase important in inflammation. until now, elk- <dig> was generally thought to be involved in regulation of proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . our discovery has therefore potentially broadened the role of elk- <dig> as factor which also controls the course of inflammation.

our results reveal also existence of negative regulatory loop controlling the synthesis of il-1β. il-1β regulates the expression of mcpip, an rnase which contributes to the turn-over of il-1β mrna .
