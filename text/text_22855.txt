BACKGROUND
thrombosis in the cardiovascular system is the one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. pharmacological thrombolysis using streptokinase, urokinase or tissue activator of plasminogen  and mechanical interventions are frequently employed to treat both arterial and venous thrombotic diseases. unfortunately, reperfusion is not always achieved and the success of the therapy is limited by reocclusion  <cit> . limitations to these approaches also include complications such as bleeding, stroke, clot embolization and vessel wall damage  <cit> . increasing evidence from in vitro  <cit> , animal  <cit> , and initial patients studies  <cit>  indicates that application of ultrasound  as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy offers unique potential to improve effectiveness and decrease bleeding complications. now, four basic approaches to us thrombolysis have been pursued - two without pharmacological agents:  catheter-delivered external transducer us,  transcutaneous-delivered hifu external us without drug delivery and us in conjunction with thrombolytic drugs and/or microbubbles or other agents,  catheter-delivered transducer-tipped us with local drug delivery, and  transcutaneous-delivered low frequency us with concomitant systemic  drug delivery for site specific us augmentation  <cit> . based on the available information the mechanisms involved in the fibrinolytic process in high-frequency, low-intensity us-enhanced fibrinolysis have been suggested  <cit>  to be non drug-specific  <cit> , not to alter the sizes of plasmatic derivatives or degradation products  <cit>  and not to be caused by clot disruption  <cit> . us with a frequency of  <dig> mhz and intensities of  <dig> - <dig>  w/cm <dig> had no statistically significant impact on biological activity of plasminogen activators: urokinase, streptokinase, alteplase and reteplase  <cit> . there is a limited data on the potential effect of us on proteins. it has been shown that high frequency  us with intensity of  <dig>  w/cm <dig> caused changes in structural order of cytochrome c, lysozyme, myoglobin, bovine serum albumin, trypsinogen and α-chymotrypsinogen a  <cit> . at low intensity us accelerates enzymatic thrombolysis through non-thermal mechanisms involving improvement in drug transport  <cit> , reversibly altering fibrin structure  <cit>  and increasing t-pa binding to fibrin  <cit> . recent studies indicated that us at lower frequencies in the range of 20- <dig> khz and impulse mode with duty cycles of  <dig> to 50% has a greater effect on thrombolysis with improved tissue penetration and less heating  <cit> . high intensity us disrupts clots into small fragments without administration of plasminogen activator  <cit> . the main mechanism by which ultrasonic lysis of thrombus occurs is termed the "cavitation effect." during the negative phase of the ultrasonic wave, microbubbles  form within tissue exposed to the sound source. during the positive phase of the wave, these cavitations collapse, giving rise to a series of shock waves that lead to disruption and fragmentation. however, despite the documented efficiency, further clinical application of us angioplasty is restricted by the initiation of distal embolization of the resulting clot debris  <cit> . our previously study demonstrated that at the conditions of a combined cavitation and streptokinase action at high us intensities, streptokinase preventing the formation of large clot debris conglomerates  <cit> . based on this, we assume that the use of low frequency  impulse  mild intensity  us in combination with thrombolytic drugs will make it possible to decrease the risk of side effects development. the effectiveness of this approach has been confirmed by our in animal study  <cit> .

with a number of described above mechanisms of us thrombus destruction and us enhanced fibrinolysis additional mechanisms may underlie the effects of us thrombolysis analyses of the products of the plasma clot destruction by the low-frequency ultrasound  showed that at the us intensities below  <dig>  w/cm <dig>  there was extraction of blood serum proteins located in the pores of the fibrin network. the increase in intensity of the ultrasonic treatment was accompanied by protofibrils disaggregation and extraction of blood serum proteins located inside fibrin fibers. proteins extracted from the plasma clot underwent subsequent aggregation, whereas interaction between protofibrils caused formation of insoluble fibrin particles  <cit> . thus, low frequency and high intensity ultrasound together with the macroscopic disruption of the clot can affect structural-functional properties of proteins.

it has been previously shown that usage of low frequency us  with intensity up to  <dig> w/cm <dig> does not influence properties of streptokinase and antithrombin iii. at us intensity exceeding  <dig> w/cm <dig>  plasminogen activator streptokinase undergoes irreversible aggregation with unfolding of protein molecule and exposure of new peptide bonds susceptible for proteolytic attack by plasmin  <cit> . after us treatment, antithrombin iii is converted into inactive forms , whereas non-activated blood clotting factors belonging to the α-chymotrypsin superfamily do not change their structural and functional parameters within ppsb complex  <cit> . at the same time, a functional model of activation of equimolar mixture of α-chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen revealed that trypsin is the most sensitive to the us treatment  <cit> .

the aim of current studies was to investigate the effects of low frequency high intensity pulse us  on the key protein of the blood coagulation - fibrinogen, as well as to investigate the effects of us on the fibrinolysis in an in vitro system. it has been shown that ultrasound induced time-dependent formation of fibrinogen aggregates, characterized by loss of clotting ability and greater rate of plasminolysis than native fibrinogen and denaturation of plasminogen and t-pa. under ultrasound treatment of plasminogen and/or t-pa in the presence of fibrin, the stabilizing effect of fibrin on given proteins was demonstrated. on the other hand, an increase in the rate of fibrin lysis was observed due to both the change in the substrate structure and promoting of the protein-protein complexes formation. studies in this direction are address the key question how to minimize side effects and increase the effectiveness of ultrasonic trombolysis.

RESULTS
fibrinogen was exposed to ultrasound for  <dig> minutes at 37°c and then assayed by sds-page under reducing and nonreducing conditions . gel-electrophoresis without reduction of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds showed presence of one polypeptide with the molecular weight of more than  <dig> kda  in the us-treated and the control samples. the same samples separated on the sds-page gel containing β-mercaptoethanol showed three identical polypeptides corresponding to native aα-, bβ-, and γ-chains of fibrinogen .

the effects of the us on functional activity of the fibrinogen were investigated. for this purpose, two physiologically important processes involving fibrinogen were tested: the formation of a fibrinogen clot and fibrinogenolysis. the clotting ability was tested by adding thrombin and measuring the increase in turbidity at  <dig> nm. for the control sample of fibrinogen, exponential increase of the turbidity with an increase of incubation time was observed . the initial velocity and the stationary level of the absorption decreased for the sample treatment ultrasound during  <dig> min . a sonication of  <dig> minutes led to the total loss of the clotting ability .

the electrophoretic pattern of the fibrinogen proteolytic degradation products by plasmin after treatment with β-mercaptoethanol is shown in figure  <dig>  identical distribution of polypeptide bands for both sonicated and control fibrinogen samples were observed. at zero time of proteolysis, three polypeptides corresponding to aα-, bβ-, and γ-chains of fibrinogen were present. the decrease of the content of the native chains and respectively the accumulation of proteolytically modified β''-, γ'-, γ''- and γ'''- chains of fibrinogen were observed during the time course of the fibrinogen incubation with plasminogen and t-pa .

next, the influence of the low-frequency us on the proteolytic degradation of fibrinogen in the fibrinogen: plasminogen: t-pa system was investigated. the fibrinogenolysis rate was estimated by determining the concentration of tca-soluble peptide released during proteins incubation at 37°c. figure  <dig> shows that us has differential effects on individual proteins. the us treatment led to increase of fibrinogenolysis rate in case of fibrinogen , while it decreased fibrinogenolysis in case of plasminogen  and t- pa  in comparison to control .

the influence of ultrasound on the rate of the enzymatic hydrolysis of fibrinogen in the fibrinogen: plasminogen: t-pa system was investigated upon introduction of the plasminogen activator after the us treatment. figure  <dig> presents data analysis of reducing and non-reducing samples of fibrinogen proteolysis products. time-dependent degradation of the native fibrinogen polypeptide chain  and accordingly the accumulation of the end products of the fibrinogen plasminolysis - fragments d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> through the intermediate formation of the partially degraded fragments x and y occurred independently of the us treatment. however, the electrophoregrams of the not reducing control sample after  <dig> hour of the hydrolysis  show the presence of only early fibrinogen degradation product - fragment x. at the same time, in the case of preliminary sonication of fibrinogen with plasminogen approximately half of all fibrinogen is converted into the fragments y and d .

the following part concerns the investigation of the influence of ultrasound on fibrinogenolysis with the us treatment of all three proteins . it is evident that in the case of combined us-treatment , an increase of fibrinogenolysis rate occurs as in case of fibrinogen.

for the investigation of us effects on fibrinolysis, the model of fibrin clot, prepared by coagulation of pure fibrinogen by thrombin in presence of ca2+ ions, was used. initial fibrinogen contained sufficient quantity of factor xiii for complete covalent cross-linking of fibrin monomers. plasminolysis was initiated by addition of the plasminogen and t-pa to the fibrinogen solution. the process of the fibrinolysis, like fibrinogenolysis, was controlled by the determination of the concentration of tca-soluble peptide formation. as in the case of fibrinogen, us-treatment leads to the increased rate of proteolysis in both cases, after treating the clot itself and clot in the presence of plasminogen and/or rt-pa. sds-page of fibrin degradation products revealed that already after  <dig> hour of hydrolysis mainly d-dimers were present. at the same time, in the degradation products of previously us-treated fibrin parallel with d-dimers early fibrin degradation products - fragments x and y were present . analysis by the scanning electron microscopy  showed that clot revealed many deepening of  <dig> -  <dig> μm in size as a result of the us action on the surface of fibrin. the analysis of the internal structure of the clot showed that multiple channels appeared near the clot surface. these channels were 1- <dig> μm in diameter, and 20- <dig> μm in length . changes were also observed in the fibrin network that acquired fine-mesh shape due to mach irregular disruptions of fibers . the quantitative analysis of the image showed substantial changes in parameters of the us-treated fibrin network compared to control. the ultrasound caused decrease of length and diameter of fibrin fibers, but at the same time increase in pore size.

discussion
this study demonstrated that the us did not cause the cleavage of peptide and interchain disulfide bonds or formation of interchain and intermolecular cross-links in case of fibrinogen . additionally, results presented here suggested that the us did not induce the conformational changes in the fibrinogen molecule leading to the exposure of a new plasmin-sensitive site . our results are consistent with previously reported data describing the effect of high-frequency us on fibrinogen  <cit>  and fibrin clot  <cit> . however, sonication of fibrinogen with the us  led to the time-dependent loss of the clotting ability . it has been reported that the γ- irradiation and free-radical oxidation leads to a loss of the clotting ability and increase of the sensitivity to the proteolytic degradation as a result of the fibrinogen aggregate formation  <cit> . to determine if the us induced aggregation of fibrinogen, the gel-permeation chromatography of fibrinogen was carried out before and after the sonication . the results of gel-permeation chromatography indicated that the formation of fibrinogen aggregates was induced by the us. it has been shown before that aggregation of antithrombin iii and streptokinase was also induced by the us  <cit> .

our study demonstrated that the us differentially affected individual proteins and led in case of fibrinogen  to increase, and in case of plasminogen  and t-pa  to decrease of fibrinogenolysis rate. it should be noted that no change in the speed of the fibrinogen hydrolysis was observed using the high-frequency us  <cit> .

it is known that in the presence of fibrinogen, fibrin and their degradation products, the rate of plasminogen activation by t-pa increases due to the formation of tertiary complex: fibrin - plasminogen - t-pa  <cit> . in this case, fibrin potentiates at greater extent an activation rate at the expense of the exposure of the plasminogen and t-pa binding sites that are latent in the fibrinogen molecule. it has been reported that the removal of fibrinopeptides a and b switches interaction of αc-domain from intra- to intermolecular interaction, facilitating the self-association of fibrin  <cit> . in this regard, the conformational changes occur, which led to the exposure of the plasminogen and t- pa binding sites on the αc-domain surface. at the same time, d-region also contains latent t-pa and the plasminogen binding sites. the exposure of these sites is a result of the noncovalent binding d-d:e  <cit> . as demonstrated above, us led to the formation of fibrinogen associates with the larger molecular weight. therefore, it is possible to suggest that the us produces conformational changes in the fibrinogen molecule leading to the exposure of polymerization sites and, as a result, of the plasminogen- and t-pa binding sites. these processes lead to an increase in the rate of the proteolytic degradation of fibrinogen. in turn, a decrease in the fibrinogenolysis rate in cases of prior sonication of plasminogen and t-pa is the result of inactivation of the active forms of these proteins, as it was demonstrated above. the effect of us inactivation enzymes was shown on example of functional model of activation of equimolar mixture of α-chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen  <cit> . high sensitivity of t-pa to the us-action is explained by the unique structure of this protein. in comparison with other proenzymes, the single-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator possesses its own catalytic activity. moreover, the activities of the single- and two-chain t-pa differ only by a factor of 3- <dig>  existing evidence strongly suggests that lys <dig> and asp <dig> interact directly in single-chain t-pa and that this interaction stabilizes the active conformation of the enzyme  <cit> .

the obtained results suggest that the preliminary us-treatment of the mixture of fibrinogen with plasminogen leads not to a decrease in the fibrinogenolysis rate, as in case of sonicated plasminogen, but to its increase. the us-treatment of the mixture of fibrinogen with plasminogen, most probably, does not cause any changes in plasminogen, and summary effect is caused by the action on the fibrinogen. it may be assumed that the basic effect of the us on the proteins is caused by the generation of free hydroxyl radicals in the field of us cavitation. thus, under the condition fibrinogen can act as the "scavenger" of free radicals and, correspondingly, summary effect on the fibrinogen proteolytic degradation for combined us-treatment is determined exclusively by effect on fibrinogen. it is consistent with the fact that fibrinogen appears to be a plasma protein that is most sensitive to in vitro metal-ion-catalyzed carbonyl formation  <cit> . during structural effect induced by therapeutic ultrasound on aqueous solution of six different proteins  important role of free radicals, produced by water sonolysis, in the changes of structural order was suggest too  <cit> .

statistical analysis showed the absence of differences in the kinetic curves of fibrinogenolysis in the following cases of us-treatment: a) fibrinogen; b) fibrinogen with rt-pa; c) fibrinogen with plasminogen and d) fibrinogen, plasminogen and rt-pa . thus, in case of us-treatment of the protein mixtures effect us on the fibrinogen proteolytic degradation is determined exclusively by effect on fibrinogen. the same results were obtained in the study of the influence of us-processing on the fibrinolysis.

it has been shown before that the us-treatment leads to an increase in the binding t-pa with fibrin  <cit> . by the scanning electron microscopy showed changes of the fibrin network in the process of us-treatment. data showed that us leads to formation of many channels in the internal structure of the clot, and irregular disruption and thinning of fibrin fibers at the level of fibrin network structure are observed . it has been demonstrated earlier that disturbances of the fibrin network under the us-action lead to an increase in the penetration of t-pa inside the clot  <cit> . due to the increased number of plasminogen/plasmin binding sites, the rate of proteolysis was increased. obtained data well agree with the layer-by-layer model of the fibrin degradation, in the case of the penetration of the plasminogen activator inside the clot due to the diffusion  <cit> . thus, in the control experiment the step-by-step hydrolysis of fibrin was occurred and the large fragments of fibrin were not released into the solution. at us-treatment of fibrin, the proteolysis took place in entire volume of clot and, respectively, the large fragments were released into solution. this is confirmed by the fact that after two hours of hydrolysis in the degradation products of previously us-treated fibrin parallel with d-dimers early fibrin degradation products - fragments x and y were present, there are not in control. the same differences were observed also at the fibrin clot lysis, induced by circulating and clot-embedded proteases  <cit> .

in summary, under ultrasound treatment of plasminogen and/or t-pa in the presence of fibrin, the stabilizing effect fibrin on given proteins was shown, while an increase in the fibrinlysis rate was demonstrated due to both the change in the substrate structure and promoting of the protein-protein complexes formation. this allows us to recommend for the in vivo experiments simultaneous introduction of plasminogen activators with the us action and limiting duration of us action by the not more than  <dig> min.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrated that the us induces fibrinogen aggregate formation in vitro, characterized by loss of clotting ability and greater rate of plasminolysis than native fibrinogen. in case of the us treatment of mixture fibrinogen or fibrin clot with plasminogen, t-pa or both, the rate of proteolytic digestive of fibrin increase too, in this case fibrin show stabilization effect on plasminogen and t-pa.
