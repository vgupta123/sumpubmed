BACKGROUND
monoculture of crops leads to decreased growth and yield in the next season, with autotoxicity the major culprit  <cit> . autotoxicity occurs when a plant releases toxic chemical substances into the environment that inhibit germination and growth of conspecific plants  <cit> . recently, an increasing number of reports have provided evidence for the role of autotoxicity in replant failure and soil sickness  <cit> . autotoxicity is a common problem in continuous monocropping of rice  <cit>  because decomposing rice straw is left in fallow fields  <cit> . a range of secondary metabolites in rice straws, such as phenolic acids  <cit>  and a few flavones and terpenoids  <cit> , are potent autotoxins.

phenolic compounds are common in soils. whitehead  <cit>  reported that the concentration of phenolic compounds in rhizosphere soil solution may reach 90 ppm. various phenolic compounds such as ferulic acid , o-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid, and p-coumaric acid have been isolated from decomposing rice residues in soil  <cit> . these compounds inhibit the growth of rice seedlings in the order of fa > p-coumaric acid > o-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid  <cit> . exposure of plant roots to fa reduces water use  <cit> , inhibits foliar expansion  <cit>  and root elongation  <cit> , and decreases nutrient uptake  <cit> . further, fa exposure rapidly depolarizes root cell membranes, causing a generalized increase in membrane permeability, inducing lipid peroxidation and affecting certain enzymatic activities  <cit> . ferulic acid may be esterified with cell wall polysaccharides, be incorporated into lignin structures, or form bridges that connect lignin with wall polysaccharides, thus resulting in cell wall rigidity and restriction of cell growth  <cit> . ferulic acid affects cell wall-bound peroxidase  and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  activities, lignin content, and root growth in seedlings  <cit> .

several reports demonstrated that autotoxins induce oxidative stress in plants  <cit> . reactive oxygen species  play a vital role in the plant defense against stresses and in cell growth and development  <cit> . low concentrations of ros, as a signal, can lead to repair of cellular damage, but high levels can lead to programmed cell death  <cit> . calcium is a crucial regulator of growth and development in plants  <cit> . ros-activated calcium channel activity is required during the growth of cells in the elongation zone of the root  <cit> .

both allelopathy and autotoxicity play important roles in regulating plant biodiversity and productivity  <cit> . autotoxins can impact many physiological and biochemical reactions in plants such as rice, alfalfa, cucumber, tomato, corn, wheat, sugarcane  <cit> . the potential mechanisms underlying autotoxicity have been explored in alfalfa and cucumber  <cit> . in alfafa, cinnamic acid is a phenolic acid and the major autotoxin in leaves and root exudates  <cit> . in cucumber, autotoxins can inhibit the membrane h+-atpase activity that drives the uptake of essential ions, other solutes and water  <cit> . however, our knowledge of an autotoxicity mechanism is poorly understood. transcriptional profiling experiments using microarrays are being conducted to examine the effects of natural phytotoxins on the plant transcriptome  <cit> . microarray analyses were used to analyze gene expression profiles of plants exposed to the allelochemicals 2-benzoxazolinone  <cit> , fagomine, gallic acid, rutin  <cit> , 3--l-alanine  <cit> , and juglone  <cit> .

rice  is a model for genomic research into the responses of monocot species to environmental stresses. in this study, we used fa as a rice-model autotoxin and used microarray assay to assess alterations in rice root gene expression induced by the autotoxin. we discuss the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species  and calcium in allelochemical signal transduction pathways. these data significantly expand on previous studies examining plant transcriptional responses to allelochemicals and provides a foundation for elucidating the autotoxicity mechanism of o. sativa, particularly the phytotoxic effect of decomposing rice residues in soil.

RESULTS
effect of fa on growth and root architecture of rice
to select an appropriate concentration of fa for stress treatments, we conducted a dose-response analysis of rice root growth 3 days after fa treatment . compared with the control, 25 ppm fa significantly reduced root growth. with 50 ppm fa, root growth was about half of the control growth, and with 200 ppm, growth was almost completely inhibited.

compared with the control, 50 ppm fa inhibited crown root, lateral root and root hair formation. both the number and length of lateral roots and root hairs were significantly reduced with 50 ppm fa as compared with the control .

c length of the  <dig> longest root hairs from the root hair zone of each seminal root. data represent the mean of  <dig> seedlings.

ferulic acid rapidly induced ros and calcium accumulation in rice roots
to determine whether fa treatment induced ros production, we labeled roots with the ros-sensitive dye cm-h2dcfda  or nitroblue tetrazolium , then treated them with 50 ppm fa for  <dig> or 3 h. ferulic-acid stress significantly increased the levels of dihydrodichlorofluorescein , and thus ros, in roots . to determine whether fa treatment induced calcium accumulation, we used a calcium indicator, oregon green  <dig> bapta- <dig>  before fa treatment. calcium level was significantly increased in root tip regions with 50 ppm fa treatment for  <dig> or 3 h .

effect of fa on lipid peroxidation
ferulic-acid–induced oxidative damage of roots was positively confirmed by schiff’s staining in the meristem and elongation zone of roots . ferulic-acid–induced root oxidative damage was measured by lox activity with non-denaturing page. we detected  <dig> lox isozymes in rice roots treated with 50 ppm fa for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h .

expression profiling by microarray assay
to identify genes and biological pathways associated with fa toxicity and tolerance in rice roots, we used large-scale expression profiling. rna samples were collected from root tips early  after fa treatment to examine rapid changes in global patterns of gene expression. we pooled rna isolated from the two short  fa exposures to maximize gene discovery. mechanisms of adaptation after long-term  fa exposure are important, but the physiological and metabolic parameters measured after long treatment periods might be distorted by the severe toxic effects of fa. we aimed to understand the primary response to fa exposure as opposed to responses to nonspecific cellular damage.

we performed microarray assays with rna extracted from roots treated with 50 ppm fa after short  and long  exposure. this fa level is comparable to that found in rice-field soils  <cit> . in all,  <dig>  genes were responsive to short fa exposure and  <dig> to long exposure. after short fa treatment,  <dig> genes were upregulated  and  <dig> were downregulated  .

we used go analysis  <cit>  to determine the functions of the  <dig> upregulated genes . the most significantly enriched go term was “response to stress” . other enriched terms were “phenylpropanoid metabolic process” , “transmembrane transport” , “proteolysis” , “cell wall macromolecule metabolic process”  and “signal transduction” . for molecular function, the significant go terms were “kinase activity” , “calcium ion binding” , “transcription factor activity” , and “chitinase activity” .

polysaccharide and cell wall metabolism
to investigate the involvement of cell-wall–related genes in fa-induced stress, we analyzed the global expression profiles of genes related to  <dig> such gene families . in total,  <dig> of the  <dig> cell-wall–related genes showed significant responses to fa:  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> downregulated. upregulated genes predominantly belonged to the expansins , yieldins , xyloglucan endotransglycosylases/hydrolases , beta-galactosidases , glycoside hydrolases  <dig> , pectin acetylesterases . and glycosyl transferases 21a .

expression profiles of ros-related genes
we analyzed the global expression profiles of genes related to  <dig> ros-related gene families . among the  <dig> ros response-network genes spotted on our arrays, transcripts of  <dig> showed changed expression after fa treatment :  <dig> were significantly regulated,  <dig> upregulated and four downregulated. the genes included alternative oxidases , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glutaredoxins , glutathione-s-transferases , monodehydroascorbate reductase , class iii peroxidase , peroxiredoxin , respiratory burst oxidase homolog , and thioredoxin . almost all aox genes were induced by fa, and  <dig> of the  <dig> gst genes were significantly upregulated by fa.

expression profiles of transporter genes
in the rice genome, transporter families are grouped by mode of transport and energy-coupling mechanism into four types: atp-dependent transporters, secondary transporters, ion channels, and unclassified transporters with unknown mechanisms of action. among  <dig>  transporter-related genes,  <dig>  were present on our arrays, and  <dig> were significantly upregulated with fa treatment . nearly all of the transporters responding to fa were atp-dependent and secondary transporters. transporters with changed expression were  <dig> of the  <dig> atp-binding cassette  transporters and three of the p-type atpase  transporters. the major facilitator superfamily  is the largest family of secondary transporters in the rice genome. ferulic-acid treatment upregulated nine mfs genes and downregulated two. transcripts for five proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter  genes and five amino acid/auxin permease  genes were upregulated. in addition, four of  <dig> drug/metabolite transporter  genes belonging to secondary transporters were upregulated by fa treatment.

these observations were further supported by comparison of metabolism genes by use of mapman. genes encoding atp-binding cassette-type and aaap transporters were differentially regulated in the early  response to fa . mapman analysis revealed that aaap transporters were significantly upregulated by fa treatment.

expression profiles of signaling genes and tfs
perception and transmission of stress signals are important aspects of the plant response to environment stress. protein kinases are crucial in these signaling pathways. the activation of signal transduction pathways connects the actions of protein kinases, tfs and the downstream stress-responsive genes. in total,  <dig> protein kinase genes were upregulated by fa, and  <dig> were downregulated . nearly all of the fa-responsive kinases were associated with the receptor-like kinase  family. in total,  <dig> rlk family genes were significantly upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated after short and long fa exposure. the leucine-rich repeat viii  and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases vii  subfamilies of the rlk family were significantly upregulated with fa treatment.

we found  <dig> tfs significantly regulated by fa:  <dig> were significantly upregulated and  <dig> downregulated after short and long exposure. transcription factors regulated by fa stress predominantly belong to the apetala2/et response factor , myb, wrky and zinc-finger protein expressed in inflorescence meristem  families . from rice genome sequence data,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes have been identified for the ap2/erf, myb, wrky and zim families, respectively. in our rice roots, fa induced  <dig> ap2/erf,  <dig> myb,  <dig> wrky and  <dig> zim families.

transporters, tfs, and protein kinases specifically altered by fa and juglone
we compared transporters, tfs, and protein kinases regulated by exposure to fa and to the ros-generating allelochemical juglone . genes encoding aaap transporters responded relatively specifically to fa . comparison of the tfs induced by juglone after short fa exposure revealed that only half of the genes  reported in our previous study  <cit>  showed changed expression in this study . the wrky and myb tfs responded significantly to fa stress. comparison of the protein kinase genes induced by juglone revealed that the lrr-viii and sd-2b families responded significantly to fa stress .

discussion
autotoxicity is intraspecific allelopathy and plays an important role in plant growth inhibition and structuring plant communities  <cit> . here, we observed that treatment with 50 ppm of the autotoxic chemical fa inhibited rice root length by 50% . plant growth as well as response to stress is controlled by phytohormones  <cit> . our microarray assay revealed changed expression of et and ja biosynthesis and signaling genes in rice roots with fa treatment . xu et al.  <cit>  reported that the combination of et and ja synergistically induced the expression of defense genes in plants. hua and meyerowitz  <cit>  and staswick et al.  <cit>  reported that ja and et treatment inhibited plant root elongation. our results suggest that these two hormones may be involved in fa-induced inhibition of root growth in rice. in addition, we found that fa inhibited crown root, lateral root and root hair formation. fa repressed the expression of two lateral-root genes  and one root-hair–related gene in rice roots  . examination of the ricexpro database revealed that ja repressed the expression of these genes   <cit> . therefore, our results suggest that ja may involve in fa-induced morphogenic response in roots by regulating these root architecture- related genes.

in general, cell walls become lignified when cell expansion decreases or when the cell is under stress  <cit> . previous study indicated that lignification may be an important step in root growth reduction in fa-stressed soybean  <cit> . our fa treatment upregulated genes involved in the cell-wall macromolecule metabolic process , particularly cell-wall reassembly. the expression of cell-wall-related genes, most notably the expansins, was enriched by fa treatment. cosgrove found that expansins are a group of wall proteins that induce wall stress relaxation and extension  <cit> . increased expansin gene activity may be involved in stress relaxation in fa-treated roots.

increased ros levels are an important component of the stress induced by allelochemicals  <cit> . ferulic acid modifies various oxidative reactions in vitro by acting as a substrate, activator or inhibitor depending on the concentration  <cit> . reactive oxygen species are toxic to plant tissues and can trigger cell growth inhibition and cell death. in addition, they may act as signal molecules involved in triggering tolerance against various environmental stresses. in this study, fa rapidly induced ros production in rice roots. ferulic acid-induced lipid peroxidation of roots was positively confirmed by schiff’s reagent staining . we found a steady increase in lox activity in response to fa . thus, fa may increase ros accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and lox activity to affect cell integrity in rice roots and contribute to fa-induced root growth inhibition.

many studies have provided evidence that ros signaling is integrated with calcium signaling networks in plants. saijo et al.  <cit>  and martín and busconi  <cit>  demonstrated rapid increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in plant cells in response to multiple stress stimuli. the change in cytoplasmic calcium concentrations is critical for activating various defense responses  <cit> . we found that fa increased calcium levels in rice roots. thus, ros and calcium may act as early second messengers in the transcriptional activation of an array of defense-related genes in rice roots under fa stress.

conjugated forms of xenobiotics can be recognized by specific membrane-associated transporters in the final detoxification phase  <cit> . our go analysis notably revealed the term “primary active transmembrane transporter activity”. we found  <dig> membrane-transporter–like sequences induced by fa, including  <dig> putative abc, nine mfs, and five aaap transporters. in plants, abc and mfs transporters represent different multidrug efflux protein superfamilies associated with resistance to xenobiotics  <cit> . the abc transporters facilitate the movement of glutathionylated toxins and other substrates across biological membranes  <cit> . we found  <dig> and three abc transporter genes upregulated by short and long fa exposure, respectively. thus, expression of abc transporters, which work in conjunction with other detoxifying systems, was found primarily with early stages of fa stress. the aaaps are efficient transporters of proline and betaine  <cit>  that accumulate in higher plants under stress conditions such as drought, salinity, extreme temperatures, uv radiation, and heavy metals  <cit> . previous reports have demonstrated a positive relationship between proline and betaine accumulation and plant stress tolerance  <cit> . our observed induction of aaaps by fa indicates their possible involvement in plant tolerance to autotoxin stress.

protein kinases are important signaling molecules in the plant response to environment stress. multiple plant rlk members are involved in the stress response  <cit> . among  <dig> rlk genes we found upregulated with fa treatment, lrr-viii and rlck-vii subfamilies were identified as significantly participating in transcriptional regulation . the involvement of lrr-viii and rlck-vii in stress responses was previously reported  <cit> . thus, differential expression of a number of transmembrane receptor kinases with fa exposure suggests that multiple receptors belonging to different families may have unique regulatory mechanisms.

responses to abiotic stresses require the production of important regulatory proteins such as tfs to mediate the expression of downstream stress-responsive genes. we found that the major tfs, ap2/erf, myb, wrky, and zim, were overrepresented in the response to fa. the ap2/erf, myb, and wrky tfs have been isolated from different plants and are important candidates for the stress tolerance response; in rice, the overexpression of ap2/erf, myb, and wrky conferred significant tolerance to abiotic stresses  <cit> . transcription factors of zim have been intensively investigated because of the role of these proteins as key regulators of the jasmonate hormonal response in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . here, we found that fa upregulated six zim genes. overexpression of zim- <dig> , a stress-inducible gene, was found to significantly increase tolerance to salt and dehydration stresses  <cit> . the observed induction of ap2/erf, myb, wrky, and zim tfs during fa treatment indicates their possible involvement in plant resistance to autotoxin stress.

reactive oxygen species are secondary messengers for the activation of specific tfs. we found that fa induced ros production. therefore, we compared the set of our fa-regulated tfs to those regulated by exposure to juglone, an ros-generating allelochemical  <cit> . our results suggest that wrky and myb tfs and lrr-viii and sd-2b kinases might regulate downstream genes under fa stress but not general allelochemical stress . moreover,  <dig> transporters were upregulated by fa, but only  <dig> transporters were upregulated by juglone. the number of upregulated genes encoding transporters was more under fa than juglone stress. especially, the aaap transporter family was regulated significantly by fa stress but not by juglone . the aaaps are efficient transporters of osmoprotectants such as proline, glycinebetaine and gamma-aminobutyric acid  <cit>  that accumulate in higher plants under stress conditions. this observation could be related to detoxification of the autotoxin in rice roots. the aaap transporters may play an important role in the fa-triggered autotoxicity mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
fa may have a significant effect on inhibiting rice root elongation through et and ja gene regulation. detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome, gst, and ros scavengers are involved in protecting against fa toxicity. moreover, proteins involved in regulatory functions and signal transduction, including tfs, calcium-regulated proteins, and various protein kinases, play important roles in the response to fa stress . future studies with rice mutants or overexpressors with altered expression of the genes identified in this work will be helpful to elucidate their biological significance and clarify new pathways involved in toxicity and tolerance to fa.
