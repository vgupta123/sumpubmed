BACKGROUND
more than ten years ago the draft sequence of the caenorhabditis elegans genome was published
 <cit> . at that time the genome was predicted to contain approximately  <dig>  genes. gene predictions have been refined over the past decade and now the majority of c. elegans genes have been experimentally verified. the release  <dig> of wormbase  contains  <dig>  protein-coding genes, which is close to the initial estimate. most vertebrate genomes contain a comparable number of genes illustrating that anatomical complexity does not correlate well with the number of genes encoded in the genome. this raises the question of why an anatomically simple animal such as c. elegans has such a large number of genes. the c. elegans genome contains several large gene families, e.g. more than  <dig>  genes encoding serpentine-type g-protein coupled receptors 
 <cit> ,  <dig> f-box proteins
 <cit> ,  <dig> c-type lectins
 <cit> ,  <dig> nuclear hormone receptors
 <cit>  and more than  <dig> cuticular collagens
 <cit> . these and other families contain large nematode-specific subfamilies, but altogether they correspond to a small fraction of the genes encoded in the genome. the treefam project groups  <dig>  c. elegans genes into  <dig>  families
 <cit> , pointing to a wide variety of different genes present in the c. elegans genome. to date only a fraction of the c. elegans genes have been functionally characterized and we are still fairly ignorant of the role that the majority of genes play in the life of c. elegans.

the domain organization of a protein provides clues to its putative biochemical function. the biological function, however, is not immediately clear from the domain structure. additional data, such as gene expression and phenotypes associated with mutations in the corresponding genes, provide further insight into potential biological functions. although large-scale expression studies have been published
 <cit> , we still lack a detailed knowledge of the expression of most genes. large-scale projects to generate mutations in every c. elegans gene  currently provide mutations in less than half of the genes. for most genes we are left with the domain structure of the protein as the primary  source of information for a putative function.

the large number of genes in the c. elegans genome poses a significant challenge for geneticists employing genome-scale approaches to identify genes of interest. for this study, we examined putative secreted and transmembrane proteins with the goal of providing an overview and practical groupings of proteins as well as educated guesses for putative functions based on selected genome-scale expression data. this work will allow researchers to select and focus on subsets of the genome for further analysis thereby increasing efficiency of large-scale reverse genetic experiments.

RESULTS
general characteristics of putative secreted and transmembrane proteins
according to predictions in wormbase release  <dig>   <dig>  c. elegans genes encode proteins with a signal peptide , i.e. proteins likely to enter the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum .  <dig>  proteins are predicted to have a transmembrane  domain. the majority of those  lack a sp. in total  <dig>  genes encode proteins with either a sp or a tm domain .

 <dig>  sp-containing proteins do not contain a tm domain and are therefore either secreted or reside in various subcellular compartments originating from the er. direct experimental evidence for a subcellular localization does not exist for the overwhelming majority of c. elegans proteins. to identify the putative subcellular locations of c. elegans proteins, we examined homologs of yeast and mouse proteins for which experimental evidence was available. we focused on proteins residing in the er, the golgi apparatus, and various vesicular compartments originating from the er . we examined the resulting list of proteins and removed known extracellular proteins, as these proteins are known to pass through the secretory pathway and are therefore only transiently present in the er or golgi. these primary analyses resulted in  <dig> proteins that likely reside in one of the endomembrane compartments originating from the er. in addition, we found that  <dig> proteins were predicted to be mitochondrial. as this group contained bona fide mitochondrial proteins, the entire group was classified as potentially mitochondrial and removed from the original list of  <dig>  sp-containing proteins. the remaining  <dig>  proteins, about 17% of the proteome, are considered in this study as putative secreted proteins.

the second group of proteins consisted of  <dig>  proteins with one or more transmembrane domains .  <dig>  of those proteins did not contain a signal peptide. experimental evidence for the localization of yeast and mouse homologs was used as an indicator for putative localization of c. elegans transmembrane proteins. in this way, we were able to assign a total of  <dig> transmembrane proteins to one or more organelles such as mitochondria, er, golgi, endosomes, lysosomes or peroxisomes. the overwhelming majority,  <dig>  proteins, lacked any predicted subcellular localization. a substantial fraction of these proteins  also lacked any recognizable domain, preventing functional predictions based on the protein sequence itself.

when tm proteins were grouped based on the number of tm domains , we observed almost  <dig>  proteins with a single tm domain and a comparable number with six or seven tm domains. the latter group contained  <dig>  putative chemoreceptors including a significant fraction where six rather than seven tm domains are predicted. with some notable exceptions, the group of single pass tm proteins contained most of the known receptors for signaling molecules as well as all the families of known adhesion molecules . we examined this group of proteins further to identify additional potential receptor families. we removed all proteins known to have non-receptor functions and enzymes like proteases or glucosyltransfereases. in addition, we removed proteins expected to localize to certain organelles . the resulting list contained  <dig>  proteins, which could be located at the cell surface. this group likely contains uncharacterized proteins acting in cell-cell communication and/or cell adhesion.

upon examination of the size distribution of secreted and transmembrane proteins, we observed that smaller proteins are strongly overrepresented within the putative secreted proteins, whereas large proteins are underrepresented . this effect becomes more pronounced for proteins lacking recognizable domains. among transmembrane proteins, small proteins  are underrepresented while proteins in a size range of 300– <dig> aa are strongly overrepresented. the overrepresentation of this size group, however, is due to the fact that  <dig>  putative chemoreceptors fall into this size range. exclusion of this group generates a size distribution of tm proteins that is very similar to the overall size distribution.

taken together,  <dig>  proteins, almost half of the genome, contain either a signal peptide or at least one transmembrane domain. currently the vast majority of these proteins have not yet been functionally characterized.

evolutionary origin of secreted and transmembrane proteins
algorithms are now available to group evolutionarily related proteins based on sequence similarities . we applied treefam
 <cit>  and inparanoid
 <cit>  to classify c. elegans genes broadly as nematode-specific , of metazoan origin  or eukaryotic . both transmembrane proteins and putative secreted proteins show enrichment in nematode-specific genes in comparison to the overall distribution of proteins . the effect is more pronounced for putative secreted proteins with no known domain. similarly among tm proteins, most putative chemoreceptors and proteins with no other predicted domains are not found outside nematodes . in contrast, proteins with recognizable domains are predominantly of metazoan or eukaryotic origin  suggesting that a large number of secreted and tm proteins in the c. elegans genome have evolved after the split of major animal phyla and probably serve nematode-specific functions.

complex and repetitive secreted proteins
we surveyed domain organization of putative secreted proteins and found a total of  <dig> different domains within this set of proteins . however, only 10% of these proteins contain two or more domains, indicating these proteins have a fairly simple domain organization. only  <dig> proteins contain four or more different domains . among those are well-known basement membrane components including laminin, nidogen, perlecan and agrin. this group also contains a number of uncharacterized proteins, some of which share a common domain organization. three large proteins with over  <dig>  amino acids  contain egf , md , va  and cl  domains in a characteristic arrangement. these genes were observed to be upregulated upon exposure to pathogens in several expression profiling studies
 <cit>  suggesting a role in immune response. another group of complex proteins  are characterized by the presence of several dc  domains alternating with kunitz protease inhibitor domains . these proteins are enriched in embryos, most notably in late stages. this enrichment is shared with core basement components such as laminin subunits and nidogen, making it tempting to speculate that large dc-containing proteins are basement membrane components.

the majority of the putative secreted proteins contain only a small number of domains. only  <dig> proteins contain more than ten domains and only  <dig> contain more than  <dig> domains. eleven secreted proteins contain multiple copies of one or two different domains  rather than a variety of different domains . among the highly repetitive secreted proteins are extracellular matrix components like emb- <dig>  let- <dig> or him- <dig>  three additional proteins  have a combination of dc and ku domains and are either strongly  or moderately  enriched in embryos raising the possibility that they are also part of the extracellular matrix. rnai experiments indicate that all three genes are essential for survival
 <cit> , further supporting this idea.

large families of secreted proteins
we used the presence of certain domains or domain combinations in combination with treefam annotations to group the putative secreted proteins into families. previously described protein families such as insulins, collagens or lectins are included to provide a comprehensive picture . most of the predicted families, even well characterized families such as the insulin family, contain some members without predicted signal peptides . we included members without signal peptides in our counts, as these are potentially secreted as well. by defining ‘large families’ as having ten or more members, we grouped  <dig>  putative secreted proteins into  <dig> families including  <dig> proteins in  <dig> families , which are characterized by a ‘domain of unknown function’ . these proteins typically lack homologs outside nematodes. in addition to these  <dig>  proteins there are  <dig> genes in  <dig> families with putative enzymatic functions, such as proteases, lipases and various hydrolases . thus, more than half of the  <dig>  putative secreted proteins belong to ‘large’ families.  <dig> proteins in  <dig> ‘large’ families contain at least one protein domain found outside nematodes. proteins containing a c-type lectin  domain comprise the largest of these families. while cl domains occur in  <dig> proteins with various domain compositions, the majority of c-type lectin proteins are small and contain either one or two cl domains alone or in combination with one of a small number of other domains. a total of  <dig> proteins fall under this definition of ‘small cl proteins’. the second-largest family is putative cuticular collagens with  <dig> members. other large families include  <dig> proteins with multiple copies of a ‘shk toxin domain’ ,  <dig> transthyretin-related proteins and  <dig> proteins containing ‘receptor l’  domains. the rcpl domain is the ligand-binding domain of the egf-receptor , the insulin-receptor  and potentially in other uncharacterized transmembrane proteins. however, most proteins with an rcpl domain have no recognizable transmembrane domain and probably are not receptors. a total of  <dig> putative secreted proteins can be classified as small putative signaling molecules or peptides. included in this group are the warthog , groundhog , groundhog-like , insulin  genes
 <cit> , nlp- and flp- genes
 <cit> . in summary, most large families of secreted proteins seem to consist entirely of nematode-specific proteins, or reflect a large nematode-specific expansion of evolutionary older families, such as lectins, collagens and insulins.

major groups of transmembrane proteins based on their putative biochemical functions
we aimed to classify  <dig>  predicted transmembrane proteins according to predicted biochemical functions.  <dig>  proteins are members of various nematode-specific expansions of serpentine-type gpcrs, which belong to the class a rhodopsin-like superfamily but are set aside as an “other” group distinct from rhodosin-type or any other hormone-type gpcrs . these serpentine-type gpcrs are considered to be putative chemoreceptors and were not further analysed in this study. an additional  <dig>  transmembrane proteins lack any predicted domains, but a portion have gene descriptions or go  annotations that provide enough information to sort into functional groups. we took into account recent database updates, which provided additional domain annotations for  <dig> proteins. no information is presently available for the remaining  <dig>  proteins. we classified  <dig>  proteins that have additional domain with regard to their putative biochemical functions. based mainly on domain analysis, and with help from treefam and go annotations , we defined  <dig> major groups :  <dig> channels,  <dig> transporters,  <dig> enzymes,  <dig> signaling proteins,  <dig> trafficking proteins,  <dig> cell adhesion proteins,  <dig> ecm components and  <dig> “other” proteins. they are composed of subgroups as described below. representative subgroups are shown in table 
 <dig> and a detailed list of proteins can be found in additional file
 <dig> .

*subgroup names and comments were excerpted or modified from pfam or interpro descriptions.

detailed descriptions for these subgroups are available at additional file
 <dig> 

“channels” and “transporters” were grouped based on established definitions
 <cit> . the largest subgroup within channels is ligand-gated ion channels with  <dig> members, including  <dig> nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
 <cit> , ten ionotropic glutamate receptors as well as glycine, serotonin and gaba receptors. in addition, the c. elegans genome contains  <dig> potassium channels
 <cit>  and  <dig> sodium channels. the largest subgroups within the transporters are  <dig> major facilitators ,  <dig> abc transporters
 <cit> ,  <dig> sugar transporters  and  <dig> amino acid transporters .

the “enzymes” group consists of various metabolic enzymes, whereas components of signal transduction pathways such as kinases were placed in the “signaling” group.  <dig> o-acyltransferases ,  <dig> udp-glucuronosyltransferases ,  <dig> aaa atpases  and  <dig> peptidases constitute major groups within the “enzymes”.

the “signaling” group consists mainly of well-known receptors, for example  <dig> gpcrs,  <dig> kinase receptors, and  <dig> adenylate and guanylate cyclase receptors .

proteins involved in “trafficking” are composed of a small and diverse family of proteins. ten t-snare proteins, eight synaptobrevins, and five synaptotagmin genes are the major constituents.

“cell adhesion” proteins were collected following the definition by cox and hardin
 <cit> . cadherins, claudin-like proteins  and several immunoglobulin or laminin g domain containing proteins are major families within this group.

“ecm” components are mostly composed of cuticlins and collagens. eleven collagen proteins are included in this group and ten of which have a tm domain in close proximity to their n-terminus. these collagens may be type ii tm proteins that are bound to the plasma membrane and then shed by various proteases as seen in mammalian collagens
 <cit> . a portion of these tm predictions by smart could be mispredictions of sps, especially when considering that three proteins  are predicted to have a sp overlapping with a tm domain at their n-terminus according to wormbase  <dig>  the majority of remaining ecm proteins are cuticlins with a c-terminal tm domain and are expected to be cleaved from the cell surface
 <cit> .

a substantial number of proteins  do not fit into any of the above categories and also do not form a homogeneous group. among those proteins are those containing one or more domains, which are not indicative of a particular biochemical or biological function, proteins with a “domain of unknown function”, and proteins, where the fragmentary information available  does not provide sufficient evidence for a conclusive placement into one of the functional groups defined above.

putative functions of secreted and transmembrane proteins based on selected genome-wide expression profiles
the overwhelming majority of putative secreted and transmembrane proteins have not been functionally characterized. we examined recently generated stage- and sex-specific expression profiles
 <cit> , as well as data sets probing the response to pathogen exposure
 <cit>  in an attempt to place putative secreted proteins and transmembrane proteins into broad functional categories. we identified genes that are substantially upregulated in a particular developmental stage  or in males compared to hermaphrodites . data for genes upregulated after pathogen exposure were taken directly from the study by engelmann et al.
 <cit> , which documents expression profiles after three different bacterial infections and two different fungal exposures.
 <cit> . b) genes more than 5-fold upregulated in l <dig> stage males compared to l <dig> stage hermaphrodites based on rna-seq data from
 <cit> . c) genes upregulated in at least one of the five infection scenarios used by
 <cit> . d) overall fraction of proteins belonging to the various groups defined in this study.

a significant fraction of putative secreted proteins and transmembrane proteins are upregulated in specific stages . compared to the entire protein data set, a comparatively large number of transmembrane proteins are upregulated in the l <dig> stage. putative secreted proteins show a higher proportion of genes upregulated in the l <dig> stage . almost 20% of the putative secreted proteins are specifically upregulated in males, suggesting a sex-specific function. while secreted proteins constitute only about 17% of the genome, expression profiles of genes upregulated upon bacterial infections
 <cit>  contain 31% secreted proteins. similarly, profiles of genes upregulated upon exposure to fungal pathogens
 <cit>  contain about 37% secreted proteins. in contrast, tm proteins are not overrepresented among the genes upregulated in these infection scenarios. as expected, many signaling proteins  are upregulated upon infection. a substantial fraction of the gpcrs  and patched receptors  are upregulated upon bacterial infection. ten of the twelve cadherins and twelve of  <dig> fatty acid metabolic enzymes  are upregulated as well. only a small fraction of tm proteins  are up-regulated after fungal exposure including five of twelve ‘fungus induced’  or ‘fungus induced related’  protein family members. overall 58% of all proteins upregulated after pathogen exposure have either a signal peptide or a transmembrane domain , indicating putative secreted and cell surface proteins encompass most of the immune response. in total, more than a third of secreted proteins  are upregulated in at least one of five pathogen exposure scenarios tested
 <cit> , suggesting that a substantial fraction of secreted proteins are part of the nematode’s immune system.

these genome-wide expression profiles also reveal potential functions for some protein families characterized by various ‘domains of unknown function’ . for example  <dig> out of  <dig> duf <dig> genes and nine out of ten duf <dig> are among those that are upregulated upon pathogen exposure , pointing to a role in the immune response. this analysis also allows a more refined functional characterization of very large families.  <dig> of the small c-type lectins are upregulated upon pathogen exposure , confirming a role for c-lectins in immune response. a comparable number of c-lectins  are more than 5-fold upregulated in l <dig> stage males. nine of these genes also show a moderate upregulation  in the l <dig> stage of hermaphrodites. a similar expression profile is identified in proteins required for sperm production such as ‘major sperm proteins’, suggesting a possible function for this particular group of c-lectins in sperm production. however, the overwhelming majority of c-lectins upregulated in males are expressed at low levels in l <dig> stage hermaphrodites, suggesting a role in males unrelated to the production of sperm. only a small number of c-lectins  are upregulated in particular developmental stages, signifying a lack of stage-specific functions. eleven of  <dig> shk-proteins are upregulated in males and  <dig> members are upregulated after pathogen exposure, indicating this family may have a similar range of functions as c-lectins.  <dig> of the  <dig> nematode-specific peptides  are also more than 5-fold upregulated in males. notably, six of ten nspa-genes and eight of ten nspd-genes belong to this group, suggesting a male-specific role for these two families in particular.

the wsn domain  is present in  <dig> tm proteins. we found that  <dig> of these proteins are specifically upregulated in hermaphrodites in the l <dig> stage. most were also highly expressed in l <dig> stage males raising the possibility that many wsn-proteins are involved in early germline or sperm development. udp-glucuronosyltransferases  are known to be involved in detoxification in mammals by adding glucosyl-groups to hydrophobic molecules, thereby allowing solubilization and secretion of toxic molecules. in c. elegans, we found these enzymes are expressed throughout all developmental stages.  <dig> of  <dig> tm domain-containing udp-glucuronosyltransferases are upregulated after pathogen exposure, suggesting involvement in immune response. seven of twelve cadherins are upregulated in embryos, implying involvement in early developmental processes, which has been shown previously for cdh- <dig> <cit> , fmi- <dig> <cit>  and hmr- <dig> <cit> .

in summary genome-scale expression profiles provide hints at a potential function for a portion of previously uncharacterized gene families. based on these data we speculate that many putative secreted proteins potentially have stage-specific functions and that a substantial fraction may be part of the nematode’s immune system.

discussion
defining the secretome
the secretome is defined as the set of secreted proteins found in the proteome of an organism, i.e. proteins that reside outside the cell
 <cit> . these proteins are important for cell communication, cell adhesion and interactions with the environment. during development secreted proteins are essential for cell fate specification and cell migrations. some provide structural support for cells and organs to determine the overall appearance of an animal. others are essential for cell communication within the organism. in addition secreted proteins mediate responses to environmental stresses such as pathogens. further still secreted proteins have enzymatic functions that range from degrading food to remodeling the body during life stage transitions. the secretome therefore is of interest to a wide variety of researchers ranging from developmental biologists to immunologists.

bioinformatic approaches are frequently used to define the ‘secretome’. the prediction of a signal peptide
 <cit> , which targets proteins to the secretion pathway, is typically used as a first filter to identify secreted proteins. various algorithms to predict subcellular localization can be used  to distinguish bona fide secreted proteins from those that reside in various intracellular compartments. however, the ability of current prediction algorithms to accurately assign novel proteins to subcellular localizations is somewhat limited, mainly due to localization and retention signals for endomembrane compartments, in particular er, golgi, endosomes, lysosomes or peroxisomes, being poorly understood. thus, a reliable identification of proteins residing in endomembrane compartments by virtue of sequence features alone is currently impossible. a more conservative approach incorporates experimental evidence indicating the presence of proteins in certain subcellular compartments. large-scale data sets of this kind are typically generated by proteomic studies, i.e. the analysis of the protein content of a purified subcellular compartment. while these studies provide direct evidence for the presence of a protein in a particular subcellular fraction , proteins ‘caught in transit’ in the golgi or the er add another level of complexity to the identification of truly resident proteins in those compartments. indeed, our manual inspection of the organelle data sets revealed several secreted proteins like collagens or bona fide cell surface receptors annotated as being present in the golgi or lysosomes. in the absence of localization information for most c. elegans proteins we had to rely on localization information from yeast and mouse homologs. identical subcellular localization across species cannot be taken for granted, especially within gene families that have expanded independently in the species. consequently the secretome as defined in this study will contain false positives and negatives, which should be kept in mind. despite these limitations our analysis suggests that as in other organisms the overwhelming majority of proteins in c. elegans with a signal peptide and no transmembrane domain are likely to be secreted and do not reside in subcellular compartments.

a number of protein families are known to be secreted and can be confidently assigned to the secretome, despite the lack of a predicted signal peptide in some members. the c. elegans genome contains  <dig> insulins, two of which lack a predicted signal peptide. this may be due to a failure of the prediction algorithm or a false prediction of the gene structure. predicting the boundaries of a gene is still a challenging problem and the incorrect prediction of the n-terminus of a protein would almost certainly lead to a failure of signal peptide prediction. in our analyses we found proteins lacking signal peptides in almost all families predicted to be secreted, suggesting that current estimates understate the number of secreted proteins.

some proteins are exported without passing through the er and consequently do not have a signal peptide. several such ‘unconventional’ secretion pathways exist
 <cit>  although we do not know how widespread their use in c. elegans is. finally, secreted proteins or peptides can also be generated by cleavage of membrane proteins. one of the most prominent examples are the β-amyloid peptides, which are generated by cleavage of app and thought to be causative agents in the development of alzheimer’s . despite our employment of different strategies to minimize false-positive and -negatives in our secretome data set, it should be noted that defining the ‘secretome’ remains a work in progress.

contents of the secretome
based on our analysis we estimate that approximately 17% of the genome encodes putative secreted proteins. the locate database currently lists approximately 7% of the mouse and human proteins as secreted
 <cit> . 17% of zebrafish and human proteins have been reported to contain a signal peptide
 <cit> , as well as 12% of mouse proteins
 <cit> , again lower than the corresponding number in c. elegans . the pedant <dig> database using targetp prediction on ensembl data sets lists 32% of c. elegans proteins as being in the secretion pathway and comparable and lower numbers  for drosphila melanogaster, tribolium castaneum, zebrafish, mouse and human proteins
 <cit> . this suggests that the c. elegans genome contains a larger proportion of secreted proteins as compared to other invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms. this seems counterintuitive, as c. elegans is much simpler anatomically and lacks the sophisticated vertebrate immune system as well as many secreted proteins known to have evolved within vertebrates. nevertheless, c. elegans possesses an elaborate set of secreted proteins illustrating that genetic complexity does not necessarily correlate with anatomical complexity.

we used data from the most recent large-scale study
 <cit>  to identify genes potentially involved in immune response. the authors used three bacterial and two fungal pathogens and found surprisingly few genes commonly upregulated upon infection. bacterial infections elicited a response very different from fungal infections and among any two of the infections there was limited overlap in response. we found that more than a third of the putative secreted proteins are upregulated in at least one of the five infection scenarios covered in this study
 <cit> . given the limited set of potential pathogens tested in this study, this suggests that a substantial fraction of putative secreted proteins may be involved in immune response.

several large protein families have been of particular interest among researchers since the genome sequence was made available. among these are cuticular collagens
 <cit> , c-type lectins
 <cit> , various families of neuropeptides
 <cit>  and known putative signaling molecules such as insulins
 <cit> , warthog, groundhog and groundhog-related proteins
 <cit> . many families of signaling molecules that are expanded in vertebrates such as tgf-βs or ephrins along with their receptors have small families in c. elegans. so, while the overall number of potential signaling molecules seems comparable, vertebrates and nematodes differ in which families of signaling molecules are expanded.

our analysis shows an enrichment of smaller secreted proteins with a significant fraction less than  <dig> amino acids. the gene structure for many of these genes is experimentally confirmed by cdna or rna-seq expression data
 <cit> . unfortunately, these smaller secreted proteins are very diverse and often contain no recognizable domain preventing speculation on potential functions. larger families found within this group consist of peptides like fmrf-like peptides , neuropeptide-like proteins  and  <dig> families dubbed nematode-specific peptides 
 <cit> . it is possible that many of the remaining uncharacterized, small secreted proteins encode a variety of peptide families as well. an analysis of the mouse secretome
 <cit>  critically evaluated signal peptide-containing proteins smaller than  <dig> amino acids. by applying stringent criteria for support of the gene model, the authors excluded  <dig> of the original  <dig> sequences as unlikely to be real genes. among the criteria used were the presence of introns, recognizable domains and the presence of orthologs. many of the small putative secreted proteins in c. elegans that have experimentally confirmed gene structures would fail this stringent test as they do not contain recognizable domains, orthologs and sometimes introns. it is therefore possible that the mouse  genome also may contain a larger number of small, secreted proteins than previously predicted. for this reason it would be worthwhile to revisit this point should additional expression information become available.

we broadly grouped the c. elegans proteins into three evolutionary categories, namely ‘nematode-specific’, ‘metazoan’ and ‘eukaryotic’ . we found that orthology databases such as treefam or inparanoid each cover only part of the c. elegans genome, so that combining the data from various databases significantly improves coverage. similar observations were made by shaye and greenwald, who recently performed a meta-analysis of orthology prediction programs and assembled a list of c. elegans proteins with human orthologs
 <cit> . 96% of the proteins contained in this ortholist are found in our metazoan or eukaryotic categories, confirming the validity of our classification.

the c. elegans secretome contains a number of large families with novel domains of unknown function. of these many are found exclusively in nematodes and few of them have been characterized thus far. members of one such family, however, have now been shown to encode enzymes, shedding light onto one of these novel families. galt- <dig>  has been identified as a member of a novel glycosyltransferase family
 <cit> .  <dig> additional duf <dig> proteins have also been added to this group of enzymes based on sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis. it remains to be seen whether the remaining members of the duf <dig> family are a more distantly related group of enzymes with similar function. the function of the remaining dufs currently remains unknown.

transmembrane proteins
transmembrane proteins regulate cell communication and adhesion and allow controlled exchange of chemicals across membranes. the c. elegans genome contains a wide variety of different transmembrane proteins. by far the largest group consists of serpentine-type gpcr receptors
 <cit> , a c. elegans expansion of gpcrs that are separately grouped as a subset within rhodopsin-type gpcr . serpentine-type gpcr receptors are typically expressed in a subset of sensory neurons and are considered to be chemoreceptors. in contrast to vertebrates, c. elegans contains a very small number of chemosensory neurons and yet has four times more gpcrs than vertebrates
 <cit> . why gpcrs are expanded in c. elegans is currently unknown, however, one hypothesis is that c. elegans depends to a larger extend on chemosensation, since it lacks visual or auditory systems found in other animals
 <cit> .

almost half of all c. elegans transmembrane proteins have additional domains or annotations that allowed for grouping into larger families and broad functional categories using gene ontology  annotations. during our analysis, we noticed some anomalies one being an unusually large number of genes  tagged with a “lipid_storage” phenotype annotation based on the genome-wide rnai screen by ashrafi et al.
 <cit> . this group of genes contains transcription factors and signaling molecules, which are merely indirectly involved in lipid storage. similarly  <dig> genes are tagged as being involved in “receptor-mediated endocytosis” based on the large-scale rnai screen by balklava et al.
 <cit> . again, no distinction is made between genes that are directly involved and those, which are indirectly involved. in these instances we validated go annotations by manual curation, however we could not completely solve this problem as many proteins do not have additional information to support or disregard the individual go annotations. the subgroups and the data used to create the groupings  are listed in table 
 <dig> and additional file
 <dig>  this format offers a simple way to re-group the proteins using existing groups or subgroups as building blocks and can be updated easily as new data becomes available.

CONCLUSIONS
the c. elegans genome is predicted to contain around  <dig>  genes. the overwhelming majority of these genes are still uncharacterized. a substantial fraction of the genome encodes putative secreted and transmembrane proteins, which are of interest in the context of studying developmental processes as well as interactions of animal and environment. we grouped all proteins containing either a signal peptide or a transmembrane domain, a total of  <dig>  proteins, using a number of criteria including similarity and evolutionary conservation. a substantial fraction of the  <dig>  putative secreted proteins seem to be nematode-specific and therefore likely have phylum-specific functions. putative secreted proteins are enriched for small proteins and proteins with no predicted domains limiting further analysis. single-pass transmembrane proteins are the largest group of transmembrane proteins containing most of the known receptors for cell-cell communication and cell adhesion. the c. elegans genome contains  <dig>  single-pass tm proteins with no known or predicted function, a group likely containing unidentified receptors for developmental processes and other functions.

combined with other information, such as genome-scale expression data sets, our classification system can be utilized to select sets of proteins for targeted functional analysis. as the extensive number of genes in the c. elegans genome poses a problem for many labor intensive screens these groupings provide an efficient tool for focusing efforts on likely candidate genes.
