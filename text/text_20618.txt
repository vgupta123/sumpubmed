BACKGROUND
the chicken was the first avian species and domestic animal selected for complete genome sequencing and assembly  <cit> . subsequently, the chicken has emerged as a premier model in animal agriculture  <cit>  and developmental biology  <cit> . although now recognized as a model organism for biomedical research  <cit> , the chicken has not been extensively used for the study of human diseases, especially metabolic disorders . several unique features of avian metabolism make the chicken an interesting model for understanding the interactions between genetic and endocrine factors that contribute to development of obesity and related metabolic disorders. in particular, chickens normally exhibit “hyperglycemia”  <cit> , insulin resistance  <cit> , hepatic de novo synthesis of lipids  <cit>  and, like humans  <cit> , abdominal  fatness is a polygenic trait  <cit> . despite their relative insensitivity to insulin, acute immunoneutralization of insulin in the chicken provokes differential expression of more than a thousand genes in both liver and in skeletal muscle  <cit> . in contrast, only  <dig> genes were differentially expressed  in abdominal fat of chickens following insulin immunoneutralization, albeit short-term fasting produced a much larger change  in transcription of abdominal fat genes  <cit> . this recent work also shows a rather large decrease in expression of lipogenic genes in abdominal fat of fasted chickens. a detailed examination of the insulin signaling cascade in adipose tissue of the chicken shows a distinct unresponsiveness to insulin  <cit> . collectively, these observations support the chicken as a unique model for the study of the genetic and biological mechanisms controlling fatness or leanness.

most mammalian models of obesity exploit single gene mutations or use high-energy, high-fat diets to induce obesity  <cit> . our chicken models are two experimental lines of meat-type chickens that were divergently selected over seven generations for either high  or low  abdominal  fatness  <cit> . these chickens exhibit a  <dig> -fold difference in abdominal fat weight at  <dig> weeks  of age, albeit their body weight and feed intake are similar  <cit> . furthermore, the fl chickens present hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipocytes at an earlier age than do ll chickens  <cit> .

differential abundance of lipogenic genes in liver of the fl and ll chickens was determined earlier by differential mrna display  <cit> , quantitative rt-pcr  <cit>  or targeted low-density array  <cit> . our preliminary analysis of the liver transcriptome in the fl and ll chickens during juvenile development revealed  <dig>  differentially expressed  genes  <cit> . quantitative trait loci  analyses of an fl x ll intercross identified a major qtl for abdominal fatness at the distal end of chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . further, the expression quantitative trait loci  analysis of gga <dig>  involving a three generation intercross of the fl x ll chickens, identified variations in expression of  <dig> hepatic genes that were correlated with abdominal fatness traits  <cit> .

the present study has a dual purpose to explore the abdominal fat transcriptome of juvenile fl and ll chickens and to identify major gene networks controlling adiposity and lipogenesis in these divergently selected models. using the del-mar 14k chicken integrated systems cdna microarray, we took transcriptional snapshots of gene expression in abdominal fat across two genotypes  and six ages during juvenile development . interestingly, our time-course transcriptional analysis of abdominal fat revealed numerous de genes  that are involved in hemostasis , adipokine signaling , retinol metabolism , and the synthesis , oxidation  and transport  of lipids. the liver is widely considered as the major site of lipogenesis in chickens and other birds. however, the present transcriptional analysis of visceral adiposity has identified  <dig> lipogenic de genes, including fasn, scd, srebf <dig>  srebf <dig> and thrspa that are expressed higher in fl chickens. the greater abundance of thrombogenic enzymes and related protease inhibitors in abdominal fat of the ll chickens suggests enhanced proteolytic processing of adipokines and other endocrine factors, with local and/or humoral actions, that could contribute to their leaner phenotype. although abdominal fat is generally considered as a passive depot for lipids, the present descriptive study in fl and ll chickens supports our idea that it does contribute to lipid synthesis and serves as an endocrine organ, which liberates a host of adipokines and endocrine factors with intrinsic and/or extrinsic activity.

methods
animals and tissue collection
the birds were bred and raised at the institut national de la recherche agronomique  ue <dig> pôle d’expérimentation avicole de tours, f- <dig> nouzilly, france. at hatching, fl and ll cockerels were wing-banded and vaccinated against marek’s disease virus. birds were reared together in floor pens  and provided ad libitum access to water and conventional starter feed for three weeks  and thereafter with a grower ration . chicks were held under continuous light  for the first two days after hatching, followed by a  <dig> h light/ <dig> h dark cycle  for the remainder of the experiment. infrared gas heaters provided supplemental heat and ambient temperature was decreased weekly from  <dig> c at hatching until  <dig> c was reached at  <dig> wk of age. eight birds from each genotype were randomly selected at six ages , weighed, bled into heparinized syringes, and killed by cervical dislocation. abdominal fat was quickly dissected and weighed; a sample was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − <dig> c until further processing. all animal procedures were performed under the strict supervision of a french government veterinarian and in accordance with protocols approved by the french agricultural agency, the scientific research agency, and the institutional animal care and use committees at inra, nouzilly, france. these procedures were also in compliance with the united states department of agriculture  guidelines on the use of agricultural animals in research and approved by the university of delaware agricultural animal care and use committee.

microarray analysis
four birds per genotype and age were randomly selected from the total of eight birds sampled per genotype and age for microarray analysis of abdominal fat . total cellular rna was extracted from abdominal fat using guanidine thiocyanate and cscl gradient purification  <cit> , followed by a separate step for dnase i treatment. the rna concentration was determined with a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . rna integrity was examined using an rna  <dig> nano assay kit and the model  <dig> bioanalyzer  to assess the quality of the rna samples . twenty μg of total rna was indirectly labeled using superscript plus indirect cdna labeling system . first strand cdna synthesis was performed in a  <dig> μl final volume containing 1× first-strand buffer,  <dig> μg of anchored oligo, dtt, dntp mix ,  <dig> u of rnaseout and  <dig> u of superscript iii reverse transcriptase with an incubation at  <dig> c for  <dig> h. the original rna template was removed by naoh hydrolysis, and followed by neutralization with hcl. the cdna was purified using a low-elution volume spin cartridge  and labeled with either alexa fluor®  <dig> or alexa fluor®  <dig> succinimidyl ester in the dark at room temperature for  <dig> h. after purification of labeled cdna with a low-elution-volume spin cartridge, the efficiency of dye incorporation was determined using the microarray module on the nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer and the base:dye ratio calculator on the invitrogen website  <cit> .

twenty-four del-mar 14k chicken integrated systems microarrays  were hybridized with  <dig> labeled samples using a balanced block design, where half of the birds from each genotype and age were labeled with alexa fluor®  <dig>  and the other half with alexa fluor®  <dig> . hybridized slides were scanned using a genepix 4000b scanner with genepix pro  <dig>  software  at wavelengths of  <dig> nm  and  <dig> nm  generating a combined tiff image file for each slide. the laser power was set at 100% with the photomultiplier tube  setting being adjusted for each scan to produce a pmt count near unity. all slides were manually checked for quality and all spots with inadequacies in signal, background or morphology were eliminated from further analysis. the image analysis results were merged with excel files in genepix report  format, which contains clone identification, spot location on slide, and most current gene name/function .

the microarray gpr files were analyzed using the linear models for statistical analysis of microarray data  software  <cit>  package in r   <cit> . median intensities for each dye were loess normalized  within array and between array  to correct for dye and slide biases. a two-way analysis of variation  was used on loess normalized intensity values from this factorial design experiment to determine the main effect of genotype , main effect of age , and the interaction of age and genotype . the benjamini-hochberg procedure  <cit>  was used to control the experiment-wise false discovery rate  from multiple testing procedures.

quantitative rt-pcr analysis
several de and prior candidate genes were selected for verification of expression by quantitative rt-pcr  analysis. first-strand cdna synthesis was performed by incubation of a  <dig> μl reaction volume  for  <dig> min at  <dig> c and then placed on ice for  <dig> min. a master mix containing  <dig> μl of 5× first-strand synthesis buffer,  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m dithiothreitol ,  <dig> μl of rnaseout, and  <dig> u of superscript® iii reverse transcriptase  was added to the rna in a final reaction volume of  <dig> μl. the cdna was diluted to achieve a concentration of  <dig> ng/μl. primers were designed for qrt-pcr using primer express® v <dig>  software . detailed information for each primer pair including gene name, gene symbol, primer sequences , genbank accession number and amplicon size are provided in additional file  <dig> 

the qrt-pcr assay was performed in an abi prism sequence detection system 7900ht, using power sybr® green pcr master mix  and  <dig> nm of each primer  in duplicate wells. disassociation curves of each sample were analyzed to validate specific amplification and verify absence of primer dimers. pcr products were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis to compare approximate product size to expected amplicon size. the ct for each sample was normalized to the corresponding sample geometric mean of three housekeeping genes . these housekeeping genes were selected using the reffinder website  <cit>  as the most stably expressed genes  in the experiment. the 2- formula was used to calculate relative transcript abundance  <cit> . the statistical analysis was performed using a general linear model procedure in sas v <dig> . the data  was analyzed using a two-factor analysis of variance to determine significant effects of genotype , age , and the interaction of age x genotype . pearson’s correlation coefficient  was used to compare log <dig> fl/ll expression ratios between the microarray and qrt-pcr analyses of select genes.

RESULTS
phenotypic measurements
body weight , abdominal fat weight , and relative abdominal fat content  in juvenile fl and ll chickens are presented in table  <dig>  the bw of fl and ll cockerels was similar for all ages between  <dig> and  <dig> wk. the absolute and relative abdominal fat weights of the fl chickens were  <dig> -fold higher  than those of the ll at all ages between  <dig> and  <dig> wk of age.

values represent the least square means  of eight birds/genotype and age with a common standard error . significance  between fl and ll was determined at p≤ <dig>  using fisher’s least significance difference  test. rows in boldface type present the fl/ll ratio of abdominal fat weight  and abdominal fat as a percent of body weight .

abdominal fat gene expression
differentially expressed  genes were defined as those having a significant false discovery rate -adjusted p-value. the significance level was set at p≤ <dig>  for genotype  and the age  × g interaction; or p≤ <dig>  for a. the statistical analysis of this factorial design  experiment provided de gene sets for the main effects of g and a, or the interaction of a × g. the main effect of g was determined by comparing gene expression values of each genotype  averaged across the six juvenile ages . likewise, the main effect of age  was determined by comparing gene expression values of each age averaged across both genotypes. to distinguish differences between ages, five single-degree-of-freedom contrasts were made by comparing the average of each subsequent age  against the  <dig> wk average . the venn diagram  shows the overall number of de genes for g , a  and the interaction of a × g  and the intersection of these de gene sets. the number of unique genes are indicated for g , a  and the a × g interaction . there were  <dig> de genes in common between g and the a × g interaction. thirty-one de genes were shared between a and g, whereas  <dig> de genes were in common between a and the a × g interaction. overall,  <dig> de genes were found in common among all three effects.

all de genes involved in the higher order a × g interaction were removed from the main effects of a and g lists. therefore, the total number of de genes presented in the a × g interaction list  in additional file  <dig> reflects the  <dig> unique genes for the a × g interaction plus those genes shared with the main effects of a  and g . the number of de genes presented in the main effect of a  and a  lists represent the total number of de genes for that effect minus those genes that belong to the a × g interaction .

ingenuity® pathway analysis  of de gene sets
significant genes  from the microarray analysis were annotated using the genebase tool on our website  <cit> , which provides protein ids  of microarray cdna probes derived from blastx analysis. lists of de genes containing the protein id and log <dig> ratio for each gene were then submitted to the ingenuity® knowledge base  <cit>  for functional annotation and mapping to canonical metabolic and regulatory pathways. “analysis ready” genes were mapped by ipa for the genotype , age , and age x genotype interaction  lists. the ipa® upstream regulator analysis was used to identify transcription factor  interaction networks, predicted activation or inhibition of tf, and their direct targets from de gene sets.

a summary of the ipa “diseases and disorders” category under “biological functions” is presented in table  <dig>  the subcategories of major interest were “developmental disorder” , “hereditary disorder” , “inflammatory disease” , “metabolic disease” , and “organismal injury and abnormalities” . a group of  <dig> genes were classified as “inborn error of metabolism” in three of the above subcategories  .

*ingenuity® pathway analysis  software was used for functional annotation and mapping of the de genes to canonical  pathways, gene interaction networks, and interactive networks of transcriptional factors that regulate differential expression of target genes. the significance of representation  is determined by ipa based on the number of de genes  found in each biological category divided by the number of known genes assigned to that category by the ingenuity® knowledge base  <cit> . the bottom panel shows the significance of the representation of de genes in canonical pathways by ipa software. the “genes†” and “ratio†” columns indicate the number of observed de genes divided by total number of genes assigned to each canonical pathway by the ingenuity® knowledge base.

one gene interaction network identified by ipa was heavily populated with a large number of hemostatic genes, which were up regulated in abdominal fat of the ll chickens . these genes are involved in coagulation  and inflammation . another group of de genes  are g-coupled receptors linked through the chemokine ligand cxcl <dig>  three genes shown in this pathway are related to steroid metabolism  and action . the transcription factor hnf1a regulates several hemostatic genes  in visceral fat of ll chickens. pparg directly regulates three adipokines  expressed at higher abundance of ll and several additional genes up regulated in the fl , including three metabolic enzymes .

the higher expression of select hemostatic genes found in abdominal fat of ll chickens was verified by qrt-pcr analysis : serine proteases  and protease inhibitors . thrombin  was more abundant in abdominal fat of the ll at all ages, except  <dig> wk. the expression of proc was 3-fold higher in the ll at  <dig> and  <dig> wk, and over 10-fold higher at  <dig> wk. the coagulation factor f <dig>  was over expressed in visceral fat of the ll by 3-fold, 24-fold, and 29-fold at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wk, respectively. the expression patterns of two serine proteases  were similar with the greatest differences at  <dig> and  <dig> wk. the qrt-pcr analysis shows similar expression patterns between some hemostatic factors and adipokines . for example, the expression of anxa <dig>  f <dig>  adiponectin , adiponectin receptor  <dig>  and attractin  were highest in abdominal fat of the ll at  <dig> wk. similarly, expression profiles of a2m, retinol binding protein  <dig>  and angiopoietin-like  <dig>  were greatest in the ll at  <dig> wk. the adipokine visfatin  was not differentially expressed in adipose tissue of juvenile fl and ll. both adipoq and angptl <dig> were identified in the main effect of age  by microarray analysis, although the log <dig> expression ratios were only slightly higher in the fl. the qrt-pcr analysis shows that the expression of adipoq was higher  in the ll between 7– <dig> wk of age, while the abundance of angptl <dig> was elevated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wk of age, albeit only age  produced a significant main effect.

the top canonical pathways identified by ipa  reflect the prevalence of hemostatic genes in adipose tissue of ll chickens. the ipa software provided functional assignments of de genes to “coagulation system” , “acute phase response signaling”  and “intrinsic prothrombin activation”  pathways. these adipose genes include serine proteases , protease inhibitors  and transporters of retinol . the ipa functional category “lipid metabolism”  shows high representation of numerous genes involved in “oxidation of lipid” , “transport of lipid” , “synthesis of lipid”  and “metabolism of retinoid” .

higher expression of lipogenic genes in adipose tissue of fl chickens
the abdominal fat of fl chickens exhibits higher expression of lipogenic transcription factors  . in contrast, additional regulators of transcription  were more abundant in abdominal fat of the ll. as shown in this ipa gene interaction network, srebf <dig> directly up regulates several genes in the fl that are involved in lipid biosynthesis  and ketogenesis . some of these genes are also targets of sirt <dig> and thrspa and differentially expressed in adipose tissue of the fl. in addition, srebf <dig> directly affects numerous genes that are expressed higher in the ll . two jun targets, prostaglandin d <dig> synthase  and mid1ip <dig> , were over-expressed in adipose tissue of the ll. insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig>  is another target of jun that was expressed at higher levels in fl adipose tissue. the ipa upstream regulator analysis predicts that jun and srebf <dig> lead to activation  of numerous up-regulated target genes  in abdominal fat of the fl chickens . in contrast, the blue blunted lines show predicted inhibition and down-regulation of de genes by jun  and srebf <dig>  in the ll . the yellow arrows indicate that the ipa analysis would expect these targets to be activated by jun and srebf <dig>  rather than down regulated as shown by these green gene symbols. the majority of the up-regulated genes found in abdominal fat of the fl  are enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.

the expression profiles of eight genes mainly associated with lipid metabolism were examined by qrt-pcr analysis . a main effect  of genotype  was observed for fasn , scd , and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme  <dig> . a significant age by genotype  interaction  was observed for facilitated glucose transporter, member  <dig> , perilipin  <dig>  and lipoprotein lipase . a main effect of age  was also observed for fasn, glut <dig>  plin <dig>  pdk <dig>  lpl, facilitated glucose transporter, member  <dig>  and superoxide dismutase  <dig> .

another network populated by numerous de genes  that control lipid metabolism shows the interaction of four transcription regulators , also up regulated in visceral fat of the fl . peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta  interacts directly with patatin-like phospholipase domain containing  <dig> , long chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase , aminoacylase  <dig> , aldehyde dehydrogenase  <dig> , peroxiredoxin  <dig> , fatty acid binding protein  <dig> , sorbitol dehydrogenase  and chemokine  ligand  <dig> . early growth response  <dig>  interacts with ccl <dig> and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coa reductase , the rate-limiting enzyme in biosynthesis of cholesterol, which is a target of the histone deacetylase sirtuin  <dig> . the ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-coenzyme a synthase  <dig>  is a downstream target of both sirt <dig> and ppard. three additional metabolic enzymes  were also expressed at higher levels in the fl, while acetoacetyl-coa synthetase , fatty acid desaturase  <dig> , and phosphomevalonate kinase  were more abundant in abdominal fat of the ll. the ingenuity upstream regulator analysis identified several additional targets of ppard , which were expressed at higher levels in either the fl  or the ll  chickens. the ipa software predicts that ppard is inhibited  based on prior knowledge of ppard action in mammals and the observed higher expression of ppard-activated targets in the ll . ipa predicts that sirt <dig> should be activated  and has a direct positive action on five target genes , which were up regulated in adipose tissue of the fl chickens. however, the yellow-colored arrows indicate that ipa expected three target genes  to be up regulated in the fl, rather than the ll as we observed.

ligand activated nuclear receptors and other transcription factors
of special interest are genes involved in ligand-activated gene transcription  which regulate lipid metabolism . functional annotation of de genes by ipa analysis identified five genes  related to “metabolism of retinoid” . an additional four retinol-related genes  were found by microarray analysis .

*fold-change  represents the ratio of fl/ll transcript abundance averaged across six juvenile ages . prior candidate genes were identified as differentially expressed  genes by previous microarray or qrt-pcr analysis of previous genetic, nutritional or hormonal perturbation studies. pearson’s correlation coefficient  of expression ratios  of  <dig> select genes subjected to both microarray and qrt-pcr analyses indicates a significant  correlation between the two methods . the exclusion of two genes with the lowest microarray fc estimate  greatly increases the pearson correlation coefficient  and the significance level .

the qrt-pcr analysis of six candidate transcription factors is presented in additional file  <dig>  four genes [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma , ppard and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor  <dig>  showed only a main effect of age . a main effect of genotype  was observed for srebf <dig> due to higher expression in the fl at  <dig> and  <dig> wk. similarly, the abundance of retinoid x receptor, gamma  was higher in adipose tissue of the fl at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wk, which produced a main effect of genotype .

the abundance of eight additional genes controlling metabolism and signaling of thyroid hormone and retinol was examined by qrt-pcr analysis . type i iodothyronine deiodinase , which converts the prohormone t <dig> to metabolically active t <dig>  showed only a main effect of age, whereas type iii iodothyronine deiodinase  presented main effects of age and genotype due to a consistently higher abundance in abdominal fat of ll chickens . in contrast, the transcriptional regulator thrspa and thioredoxin interacting protein  showed a main effect of age  and genotype  with higher expression in visceral fat of fl chickens at five of the six ages examined. four genes involved in retinol metabolism  and the retinoic acid-induced gene  <dig>   were also examined by qrt-pcr analysis . although higher in the ll between  <dig> and  <dig> wk of age, bcmo <dig> produced only a main effect of age . the expression of bco <dig> sharply increased with age  and was consistently higher in abdominal fat of the ll birds . similarly, raig <dig> showed main effects of age and genotype, with higher expression in the ll at  <dig> wk of age. the abundance of retsat was higher in visceral fat of the fl at  <dig> and  <dig> wk. furthermore, the retinoid ligand-activated transcription factor rxrg was up-regulated in the fl, especially at  <dig> wk of age .

an array of de and prior candidate genes was selected for verification of gene expression using qrt-pcr analysis . pearson’s correlation coefficient  of expression ratios  of  <dig> select genes subjected to both microarray and qrt-pcr analyses indicates a significant  correlation between the two methods . the exclusion of two genes with the lowest microarray fc estimate  greatly increased the pearson correlation coefficient  and the significance level .

another gene interaction network  identified by ipa shows interactions of several ligand-activated nuclear receptors and transcription regulators . the target genes of these upstream regulators were up regulated in abdominal fat of the fl  or ll chickens .

a final non-redundant set of genes involved in lipid metabolism was identified by ipa from the g, a and a × g de gene lists and then was used for ingenuity® upstream regulator analysis. this analysis illustrates the interaction of numerous ligand-activated nuclear receptors and other transcription factors , providing predictions of either an activated  or inhibited  state . these predictions are based on prior knowledge of transcriptional responses  and the responses of downstream targets found in the de gene data set. for example, this mechanistic network of transcription regulators indicates whether the tf  and target gene  are both activated or if the activity of the tf is inhibited , which would be associated with increased expression in the ll . this mechanistic network predicts inhibition  of eight transcription factors  and the activation  of an additional eight transcription factors  . the gene targets are presented for two transcription factors  predicted to be inhibited and four transcription factors  that were predicted to be activated by the ipa upstream regulator analysis. this mechanistic analysis shows that three transcription factors  exert direct actions on target genes up-regulated in the ll, while three other transcription factors  mainly target up-regulated genes in the fl, which are involved in the synthesis, transport or metabolism of lipids.

ingenuity upstream regulator analysis® identified multiple transcription factors  controlling a greatly amplified number of lipid metabolism genes in abdominal fat during juvenile development  of fl and ll chickens . the activation z-score indicates whether the observed gene responses to upstream regulators agrees with expected changes derived from the literature and accrued in the ingenuity® knowledge base  <cit> . a fisher’s exact test was used to determine the significance for enrichment of our target de genes controlled by numerous upstream regulators and annotated in the ingenuity® knowledge base.

discussion
the divergent fl and ll chickens were originally developed as experimental models to study genetic and endocrine mechanisms controlling excessive abdominal fatness  <cit> . indeed, juvenile fl and ll chickens exhibit a  <dig> -fold difference in abdominal fatness between  <dig> and  <dig> wk of age while maintaining similar rates of growth , feed intake, and energy metabolism  <cit> . the divergence of adiposity between the fl and ll chickens occurs at  <dig> wk of age  <cit> ; hyperplasia of adipocytes was found as early as  <dig> wk of age in the fl  <cit> , followed by marked hypertrophy of adipocytes by  <dig> wk of age  <cit> . the fl chickens appear to favor partitioning of energy and nutrients into abdominal fat, whereas the ll deposit more protein into skeletal muscle, especially breast muscle  <cit> . a consistent feature of metabolism in the fl chickens is a glucose-insulin imbalance, where plasma glucose levels are lower and insulin levels are slightly elevated  <cit> . the higher rate of lipogenesis observed in liver of fl chickens contributes to a greater accumulation of abdominal fat in this genotype  <cit> . the search for major genes contributing to the divergence in adiposity between the fl and ll has primarily focused on the liver  <cit> . in the present study, the del-mar 14k integrated systems microarray was used to examine gene expression profiles of abdominal fat in juvenile fl and ll cockerels across six ages . this analysis of time-course transcriptional profiles has provided the first panoramic view of the abdominal fat transcriptome in the fl and ll chickens and given functional insight into the  <dig> -fold divergence of adiposity. in particular, we have discovered numerous de genes that are involved in hemostasis , adipokine signaling, thyroid hormone and retinol action, and lipogenesis in abdominal fat of fl and ll chickens during juvenile development. these findings are unlike previous microarray studies of adipose tissue in meat-type chickens.

higher expression of blood coagulation factors in adipose tissue of ll chickens
a large number of genes involved in hemostasis were differentially expressed in adipose tissue of ll chickens . several coagulation factors identified in our transcriptional analysis of adipose tissue are either proteases  or protease inhibitors . we also found higher expression of carboxypeptidases  in abdominal fat of ll chickens. our discovery of a higher abundance of several genes encoding blood clotting factors in ll chickens is quite peculiar given that fattening, rather than leanness, in mammals is usually associated with the prothrombotic state  <cit> . in fact, obesity in humans is described as chronic low-grade inflammation where expression of hemostatic genes  are positively associated with greater deposition of adipose tissue  <cit> . the adipokine pai- <dig>  encodes a secreted regulator of fibrinolysis, which serves as a biomarker for metabolic syndrome in humans  <cit> . although pai- <dig> has not been mapped to the chicken genome, we did find higher expression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor  <dig> rna-binding protein  in abdominal fat of the fl chickens. the serbp <dig> protein greatly increases the degradation of pai- <dig> mrna in rat hepatoma cells  <cit> . in addition, serbp <dig> functions as a partner with the progesterone receptor membrane component  <dig>  in mediating the anti-apoptotic action of progesterone on the female reproductive tract of humans  <cit> . our identification of serbp <dig> and its up-regulation in adipose tissue of the fl suggest that a functional homolog of pai- <dig> does exist in the chicken. another related member of the same clade as pai-i, serpine <dig> was not differentially expressed in abdominal fat of fl and ll chickens according to microarray analysis. since serpine <dig> was one of the most stably expressed genes in our qrt-pcr analysis, it was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize gene expression. another hemostatic gene up regulated in abdominal fat of ll chickens was thrombospondin  <dig> , which inhibits adipogenesis in mammals  <cit> .

hemostatic proteins have several functions, some of which include removal of signal peptides, activation of zymogens, transport of enzymes, or degradation of active enzymes. given that many adipokines have a high functional and structural similarity to the classic coagulation factors and other hemostatic factors , it is reasonable to assume that these proteases act on pre-pro-adipokines or other secreted proteins expressed in adipose tissue. little is known about the expression of blood coagulation genes in visceral fat or their role in the development of adiposity in chickens. using k-means clustering , we found that the expression profiles for most genes involved in coagulation were clustered with those of adipokines; this general trend was verified by qrt-pcr analysis . for example, secreted proteins adipoq and atrn have expression patterns that are similar to those of serine proteases  and protease inhibitors . further, the developmental profiles of rbp <dig> and angptl <dig> were similar to that of a2m, a protease inhibitor and transporter of cytokines. the positive correlation of expression patterns between coagulation factors and adipokines is not surprising given that many adipokines are associated with hemostatic or inflammatory processes ; and conversely, several genes involved in coagulation are considered as adipokines . furthermore, a similar transcriptional analysis of liver from the same individual fl and ll birds failed to reveal differential expression of these blood coagulation factors  <cit> . the lack of a parallel effect of genotype on hepatic expression of coagulation factors in the fl and ll chickens suggests that their ectopic expression in abdominal fat is specific and without consequence to systemic hemostasis.

adipokines identified in abdominal fat of fl and ll chickens
a prime example of proteolytic processing of adipokines comes from our discovery of chemerin , which is expressed at higher levels in abdominal fat of ll chickens. chemerin is a recently discovered adipokine that regulates adipogenesis; and chemerin can be transformed into a pro-inflammatory protein, a cell adhesion factor or an anti-inflammatory peptide, depending upon cleavage by specific proteases  <cit> . after removal of the n-terminal signal peptide, pro-chemerin is processed at the c-terminal end by serine proteases to generate an active pro-inflammatory adipokine, which can be cleaved further at its c-terminal end by cysteine proteases to generate an anti-inflammatory peptide  <cit> . active chemerin appears to exert its action by binding its extracellular receptor cmklr <dig> on adipocytes and/or ccrl <dig> on activated macrophages, which then forms an adhesive bridge between these two resident cells in adipose tissue during the inflammatory response  <cit> . adipocyte-derived chemerin causes insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells  <cit> ; and as a secreted adipokine, chemerin regulates myogenesis by providing negative cross-talk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle  <cit> . consequently, chemerin functions as a chemokine for leukocytes, an adipokine that regulates angiogenesis, and a biomarker of metabolic syndrome and obesity in humans  <cit> . however, chemerin appears to be associated with leanness in the chicken.

retinol binding protein  <dig> , the main transporter of retinol in blood, is another adipokine that was expressed higher in abdominal fat of ll chickens at  <dig> and  <dig> wk of age. like chemerin, rbp <dig> serves as a biomarker of obesity-related diseases including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and visceral obesity in both adult and adolescent humans  <cit> . similar to other genes involved in coagulation, chemerin and rbp <dig> are expressed higher in ll, rather than fl chickens. in contrast, several adipokines  found in abdominal fat of fl and ll chickens are regulated similar to mammals. for example, adipoq is inversely related to fatness and it is associated with increased insulin sensitivity in mammals  <cit> . from the qrt-pcr analysis, we observed late up-regulation of adipoq  and its receptor adipor <dig>  in ll chickens, which suggests that adipose tissue of fl chickens could be less sensitive to insulin at these ages. attractin  is a neuropeptide involved in melanocortin signaling and regulation of food intake, which suppresses diet-induced obesity  <cit> . our qrt-pcr analysis shows that the expression of atrn markedly increases in abdominal fat after  <dig> wk of age in both the fl and ll; furthermore, the expression pattern of atrn is strikingly similar to that of adipoq and adipor <dig>  the adipokine angptl <dig> was expressed higher in ll chickens at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wk of age, although this difference was not statistically significant by qrt-pcr analysis. originally, angptl <dig> was identified as a secreted “fasting-induced adipose factor ” in the mouse that was sharply up regulated by fasting and a target gene of the transcription factor ppara  <cit> . in fact, angptl <dig> is a potent irreversible inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase  activity, which leads to hypertriglyceridemia  <cit> . our qrt-pcr analysis shows a 3-fold increase in expression of lpl in the ll chicken at  <dig> wk. of particular interest, angptl <dig> promotes the cleavage of lpl, while the proteolytic cleavage of angptl <dig> by proprotein convertase releases a more potent inhibitor of lpl activity—the n terminal domain  <cit> . thus, abdominal fat of chickens is enriched with adipokines, which can exert either local  or systemic  actions after proteolytic processing and secretion into circulation .

our initial survey of global gene expression in abdominal fat of juvenile fl and ll chickens highlights another important feature of the avian endocrine system—the virtual absence of several important adipokines normally found in mammals. a few examples of adipokines not yet mapped to the current draft of the chicken genome , include leptin , omentin , resistin , tumor necrosis factor alpha , and pai- <dig>  the existence of the chicken lep gene remains a great and unresolved controversy  <cit> , especially since extensive expressed sequence tag   <cit>  and whole genome sequencing projects have failed to identify a bona fide lep gene in the chicken. furthermore, the lep gene is absent from the genome of all birds sequenced so far . however, the leptin receptor  gene is expressed in several chicken tissues  <cit> ; and chicken lepr is capable of activating the jak-stat pathway in vitro <cit> . similarly, components of tnf signaling are up regulated in the hypothalamus of ll chickens  <cit> , although tnfa is yet to be identified in chickens. despite the absence of several mammalian adipokines  and metabolic enzymes , adipogenesis and lipid metabolism in the chicken are robustly regulated by mechanisms that are, for the most part, similar to those described in mammals.

retinol metabolism and retinoic acid signaling in adipose tissue
another remarkable observation from the present study was the over expression of  <dig> genes in abdominal fat of ll chickens that control metabolism of retinol, the precursor of retinoic acid , which itself is a major chemical activator of multiple transcription factors controlling lipogenesis. the primary source of retinol is dietary plant-based β-carotene, which is symmetrically cleaved by the enzyme β-carotene monooxygenase  <dig>  into two molecules of retinal. recently, we discovered mutations in the proximal promoter of bcmo <dig>  which are responsible for variation in the color of breast meat in another f <dig> resource population of meat-type chickens  <cit> . another enzyme, β-carotene oxygenase  <dig> , asymmetrically cleaves one molecule of β-carotene to generate one molecule of retinal and a by-product , which acts downstream to block signaling of pparg  <cit> . the bco <dig> gene in chickens was originally identified as the yellow skin gene, which controls the β-carotene content and thereby yellow pigmentation of the skin  <cit> . our qrt-pcr analysis of these two β-carotene degrading enzymes , showed only a main effect of age on expression of bcmo <dig>  whereas the abundance of bco <dig> was greater in abdominal fat of ll chickens, producing a main effect of genotype. another study found increased expression of bco <dig> in adipocytes from bcmo <dig> knockout mice and that dietary β-carotene reduces adiposity of mice—but only in the presence of a functional bcmo <dig> enzyme  <cit> . this study also demonstrates the importance of bcmo <dig> in generating the precursor  for ra, which inhibits activation of pparg and its lipogenic target genes that are mainly metabolic enzymes, adipokines and transport proteins . our study shows higher expression of both bcmo <dig> and bco <dig> in abdominal fat of the ll chickens after  <dig> wk of age, which presumably would lead to generation of more retinal and ra. this idea is supported by the differential expression of several genes involved in retinol metabolism and ra signaling in adipose tissue of fl and ll chickens. these genes are involved in transport of retinol , metabolism of retinol , and respond to ra . in 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes, ra inhibits adipogenesis via up-regulation of the transcriptional modulator smad <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, two members of the smad family  were up-regulated  in adipose tissue of ll chickens . the ligand  activates its nuclear receptors , which can form heterodimers with other ligand-dependent transcription factors  to initiate transcription of numerous downstream target genes. thus, ra seems to play an important role in reduction of adipogenesis and adiposity in the ll chickens.

visceral adipose tissue as a major site of lipogenesis in chickens
because the liver is widely considered as the primary site of de novo lipid synthesis in birds, most transcriptional studies of lipogenesis in the chicken have focused on liver rather than adipose tissue. a targeted low-density array enabled an initial transcriptional analysis of liver  in the fl and ll chickens  <cit> . this study showed up-regulation of several lipogenic genes  in the fl chickens. examination of hepatic gene expression at three ages  in another population of chickens divergently selected on abdominal fatness revealed differential expression of several genes involved in lipid metabolism, including acat <dig>  cebpγ, fabp <dig>  apoa <dig>  mdh <dig>  apod and pparg <cit> . a time-course  transcriptional study of liver in juvenile fl and ll chickens revealed  <dig>  differentially expressed  genes, mostly between  <dig> and  <dig> wk  <cit> . these functional genes identified in the liver of juvenile fl and ll birds were transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, transport proteins, differentiation factors, signaling molecules and adipokines.

in contrast, there have been only a few transcriptional studies of adipose tissue in the chicken. for example, a comparison of abdominal fat between meat-type  and egg-type chickens  at a single physical age , albeit at different physiological ages, focused attention on the up-regulation of lpl in broiler chickens and higher expression of apoa <dig> in layers  <cit> . another study using abdominal fat samples taken at  <dig> wk from a different population of divergently selected fat and lean chickens reported the differentially expression of  <dig> adipose genes   <cit> . their conclusion that tnfa plays a key role in lipid metabolism of the chicken is surprising, since this adipokine has not been mapped to the chicken genome sequence. a recent transcriptional study of chicken abdominal fat compared a short-term  fasting response with acute insulin immunoneutralization  <cit> . surprisingly, fasting provoked larger changes in adipose gene transcription  than did insulin neutralization with only  <dig> de genes, which confirms the insensitivity of chicken abdominal fat to insulin  <cit> . in contrast, more than a thousand genes were either differentially expressed in liver or leg muscle of the same birds following insulin immunoneutralization  <cit> . nonetheless, short-term fasting in the chicken depressed the expression of  <dig> genes in abdominal fat that are involved in the synthesis and storage of lipid, while a number of adipose genes that control lipolysis and oxidation of fatty acids were up-regulated by fasting or insulin neutralization  <cit> .

the present study has identified a large number of lipogenic genes that are up regulated in abdominal fat of fl chickens . a prime example of this lipogenic group is our clone for gh <dig>  that corresponds to the short form of chicken gh , which lacks a signal peptide and is highly expressed in ocular tissue  <cit> , pituitary gland and heart of chick embryos  <cit> . the short alternatively-spliced  isoform of full length gh  appears to function as an “intracrine” factor within the cell  <cit> . our discovery of higher expression of scgh in abdominal fat of the fl chicken supports the idea of a local lipogenic action of gh on adipose tissue, rather than the lipolytic response usually observed in mammals  <cit> . in fact, our earlier work clearly established the lipogenic action of exogenous gh in juvenile chickens  <cit> .

up-regulation of two transcription factors  and the histone deacetylase sirt <dig> in abdominal fat of the fl were accompanied by higher expression of multiple genes involved in the generation and metabolism of lipids . the higher expression of the transcription factor srebf <dig> and  <dig> lipogenic target genes in the fl strongly supports our idea that the divergence in abdominal fatness of fl and ll chickens could be related to differential expression of several lipogenic genes in abdominal fat of the fl. for example, fads <dig>  which catalyzes the rate limiting step in synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, was highly up regulated in abdominal fat of fl chickens; binding sites for both srebf <dig> and ppara are found in the promoter region of fads <dig> <cit> . likewise, srebf <dig> regulates transcription of several genes that control synthesis of fatty acids, including acetyl-coa carboxylase alpha , which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis  <cit> . furthermore, mid <dig> interacting protein  <dig>   enhances acaca polymerization and its enzymatic activity  <cit> . adipose tissue from fl chickens shows higher expression of thrspa, a transcriptional regulator of several lipogenic genes in the chicken  <cit> . earlier, we discovered a 9-base pair deletion near the putative dna-binding domain of chicken thrspa and demonstrated association of this insertion/deletion polymorphism with abdominal fatness traits in multiple resource populations of chickens  <cit> . mutations in the thrspa gene of chickens  <cit> , ducks  <cit>  and geese  <cit>  are associated with fatness traits and are perhaps of potential use as molecular markers in poultry breeding programs. furthermore, thrsp is a major regulator of adipogenesis in skeletal muscle of beef cattle  <cit>  and of lipogenesis in the lactating mammary gland of the dairy cow  <cit> . interestingly, the thrsp-null mouse shows reduced lipogenesis in the mammary gland  <cit>  and pups from the thrsp-null mouse exhibit reduced body weight gain due to diminished milk triglycerides  <cit> . in humans, amplification of the thrsp locus is associated with lipogenic breast cancer  <cit> ; and, as such, thrsp serves as a marker of aggressive breast cancer and a potential target of anti-cancer drugs  <cit> . in humans, expression of thrsp in adipose tissue is depressed by transition from a lipogenic fed state to a lipolytic state induced by a  <dig> hr fast  <cit> . these observations support the idea that thrsp is a transcriptional activator of several lipogenic enzymes  in the mouse  <cit> . thrsp is activated in response to t <dig>  glucose and insulin and inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids  <cit> , cyclic amp or glucagon  <cit> . recent work has shown that induction of thrsp increases expression of fasn in cultured hepatocyte cells and rnai-mediated knock-down of thrsp depresses expression of fasn  <cit> . another study showed that fasn co-precipitates with thrsp in nuclear extracts from the mouse . the exact mechanism by which thrsp and mid1ip <dig> interact and work as regulators of gene transcription is currently unknown. these genes are highly expressed in fatty tissues of birds and mammals, where they regulate the expression and activity of multiple lipogenic enzymes. the proximal  promoter region of thrspa contains four putative binding sites for pparg and four srebf sites . in the present study, we found higher expression of thrspa in abdominal fat of fl chickens at all ages, except at  <dig> wk. in the rat, the far-upstream region of the thrsp promoter contains three t3-thr response elements   <cit> . thus, thrspa is responsive to metabolically active thyroid hormone  generated by the activation enzyme dio <dig>  whereas the enzyme dio <dig> is responsible for degradation of metabolically active t <dig> and conversion of the prohormone  to metabolically inactive reverse t <dig>   <cit> . the up regulation of dio <dig> in adipose tissue of juvenile ll chickens  suggests that less t <dig> would be available to activate thrspa transcription, which was observed in the ll. thioredoxin interacting protein  is another important regulator of hepatic glucose metabolism  <cit>  that also mediates hypothalamic control over energy utilization and adiposity in the mouse  <cit> . the up-regulation of txnip in abdominal fat of the fl during the period of maximal fatness  could contribute to their enhanced lipogenesis and adiposity. likewise, we have discovered another putative sensor of glucose, the sweet taste receptor  <dig>  gene, which is differentially expressed in the hypothalamus  <cit>  and abdominal fat  of fl and ll chickens. our observation of higher expression of tas1r <dig> in the hypothalamus of the fl and abdominal fat of the ll suggest tissue specific regulation of this important tissue glucose sensor  <cit> .

increased lipolysis in abdominal fat of ll chickens
in contrast to the enhanced lipogenic state found in abdominal fat of fl chickens, the ll show higher expression of numerous genes involved in lipolysis . two cytochrome p <dig> family members  were expressed at higher levels in abdominal fat of the ll when compared to fl chickens. cyp27a <dig> is involved in clearance of cholesterol via bile excretion, whereas cyp2e <dig> is strongly induced in white adipose tissue of the rat by prolonged fasting  <cit> . the beta-subunit  of mitochondrial tri-functional protein , a complex that catalyzes the final three steps of β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids, was also up regulated in adipose tissue of ll chickens. mtp knockout mice exhibit neonatal hypoglycemia and sudden neonatal death indicating its essential role in β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids  <cit> . two members of the hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase family  were also expressed higher in adipose tissue of the ll. the significance of hsd17b <dig> in β-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids was demonstrated in hsd17b <dig> knockout mice, which were unable to degrade phytanic and pristanic acids  <cit> . since the other 17β-hsd  exhibits retinol dehydrogenase activity  <cit> , its up-regulation in adipose tissue of the ll chicken suggests increased availability of all trans-retinoic acid. in addition, pdk <dig>  which inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coa  <cit> , was highly up-regulated in abdominal fat of the ll between  <dig> and  <dig> wk. the high expression of pdk <dig> in the liver of chicken embryos  <cit> , whose energy is derived exclusively from yolk lipids, supports a similar action of pdk <dig> in adipose tissue of the ll chickens. furthermore, the expression of pdk <dig> increased sharply in abdominal fat of two-week-old chickens by a 5-h fast or insulin immunoneutralization  <cit> . the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> enhances lipid catabolism and induces expression of guanidinoacetate n-methyltransferase , which enhances β-oxidation of fatty acids  <cit> ; both of these genes were up regulated in visceral fat of the ll chickens. another gene up regulated in the ll that protects against oxidative stress is sod <dig>  which is expressed at higher levels in the liver of low-growth  chickens  <cit> . thus, the present time-course transcriptional analysis of abdominal fat in juvenile fl and ll chickens provides compelling evidence for enhanced lipolysis in adipose tissue of the ll.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study adds a new dimension to function of visceral fat as a proteolytic processor of adipokines and other endocrine signals that control lipid metabolism. in particular, the ll cockerels exhibit high expression of several blood coagulation factors in adipose tissue, albeit not in liver. some of these changes in the ll occur before the divergence in fatness. these hemostatic proteases and protease inhibitors could be involved in activation of adipokines, chemokines and other metabolic ligands that contribute to suppression of lipogenesis and adipogenesis in the ll. furthermore, abdominal fat of the ll chickens has higher expression of genes involved in mobilization, utilization and export of lipids than does the fl. several transcription factors have a larger number of target genes expressed higher in the ll that could also favor suppression of abdominal fat accretion. in contrast, abdominal fat of the fl chickens expresses a greater abundance of numerous target genes involved in lipogenesis and adipogenesis, which could contribute to their greater adiposity. the higher expression of these target genes in fl chickens appears after the onset of divergence in fatness. therefore, abdominal  fat of the chicken could play a more significant role in lipogenesis and adiposity than previously considered. the assumption that the liver of birds serves as the major site of lipogenesis needs to be re-examined.
