BACKGROUND
proteases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in other proteins and are often used in biotechnology, industry, and agriculture as bio-control agents against parasites. serine proteases  are present in virtually all organisms and exist as two major families, the trypsin-like  and the subtilisin-like  families. these two families have independently evolved with a similar catalytic mechanism which has been widely investigated  <cit> . although the overall fold of various serine proteases may differ, they all follow the same mechanism of action through an identical stereochemistry of the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole. in this mechanism, the ser functions as the primary nucleophile and the his plays a dual role as the proton donor and acceptor at different steps in the reaction. the role of asp is believed to bring the his into the correct orientation to facilitate the nucleophilic attack by the ser. the role of the oxyanion hole is to stabilize the developing negative charge on the oxygen atom of the substrate during the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate  <cit> .

serine proteases secreted by nematophagous and entomophagous fungi are one of the important virulence determinants in the infection processes of invertebrate mycopathogens  <cit> . they function mainly to degrade insect and nematode cuticles. these cuticles comprise primarily chitin fibrils embedded in a protein matrix, in which the quantity and type of proteins vary between species, tissues and growth stages of insects and nematodes  <cit> . during the infection process, an initial mechanical pressure may play a role but of major importance is the subsequent enzymatic degradation of cuticles within the immediate vicinity of the infection hyphae. being accompanied by the enzymatic degradation, the cuticles are penetrated and the prey is invaded and eventually digested by fungi. associated with the ability to penetrate the complex and variable cuticle structures, the pathogenic fungi produce a number of different cuticle-degrading enzymes such as lipases, chitinases and at least four different classes of proteases  <cit> . among these proteases the most extensively studied insect cuticle-degrading protease is a serine protease, pr <dig>  produced by an entomopathogenic fungus metarhizium anisopliae  <cit> . pr <dig> is a crucial factor in the infection of the insect because it is produced more rapidly and is in a higher concentration than the other cuticle-degrading enzymes  <cit> . furthermore, it has been observed, using gold-labeled antibodies, that the pr <dig> is secreted by the metarhizium anisopliae during penetration of the host cuticle  <cit> . a similar protease, vcp <dig> from the nematophagous fungus, pochonia chlamydosporia , has also been observed to play an important role during the infection process of nematode eggs  <cit> . more recently, an alkaline serine protease, ver <dig> from the nematophagous fungus lecanicillium psalliotae exhibiting cuticle-degrading and nematicidal activity was cloned and sequenced by our laboratory  <cit> .

cloning and sequencing of genes encoding the three proteases  have shown that they have a high degree of sequence similarity with each other and belong to the proteinase k family of subtilisin-like serine proteases  which is a large family of endopeptidases found only in fungi and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . these enzymes show conservation of the asp-his-ser catalytic triad and catalytic domain. however, the three-dimensional  structures have not been resolved for any of the cuticle-degrading proteases so far by either x-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance  techniques. a thorough understanding of the 3d structures of these enzymes can provide greater insight into the mechanism and specificity of enzyme catalysis which would guide future targeted mutagenesis for improved efficiencies.

in this paper, the 3d structural models of the mature enzymes for pr <dig>  vcp <dig>  and ver <dig> were modeled based on the available high resolution crystal structure  of proteinase k using the homology modeling technique. based on both the multiple sequence alignment and structural models, predictions were made for these cuticle-degrading enzymes concerning calcium-binding site, disulfide bridge, salt bridge, hydrogen bond, aromatic interaction, substrate-binding site and electrostatic surface potential. the physiochemical and geometrical properties of the three cuticle-degrading enzymes and the template protease k were compared to identity factors that might contribute to substrate specificity and host preference by these fungi.

RESULTS
comparison of physiochemical properties
the calculated physiochemical properties and the experimentally determined optimal reaction conditions of the three cuticle-degrading enzymes and proteinase k are listed in table  <dig>  cuticle-degrading enzymes share certain physiochemical properties such as comparable amino acid residue number , low molecular weight , high pi value , comparable extcoef value, and susceptivity to inhibition by the phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride . enzyme kinetics assays with substrates such as suc-ala-ala-ala-p-nitroaniline, suc-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroaniline and casein have revealed that they are all alkaline extracellular serine proteases with an optimum activity at ph 8– <dig> and are highly active at temperatures around 60°c  <cit> . the amino acid sequence identities of pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig> with respect to 1ic <dig> are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, respectively. these similar properties are consistent with earlier propositions that these cuticle-degrading proteases from different fungi are members of the proteinase k family of subtilisin-like serine proteases.

model description and structural comparison
pairwise least square superpositions of the four structural models give backbone root mean deviation  values of  <dig> – <dig>  Å. the structural resemblance with regard to the rmsd value is in the following order: pr1-vcp <dig> > ver112-pr <dig>  > vcp1-ver <dig>  > ver112-1ic <dig>  > 1ic6-pr <dig>  = 1ic6-vcp <dig> , indicating that the models of the cuticle-degrading enzymes are more similar to each other than to 1ic <dig>  this roughly reflects the amino acid sequence identities between them. the sequence identities of pr1-vcp <dig>  ver112-pr <dig>  vcp1-ver <dig>  ver112-1ic <dig>  1ic6-pr <dig>  and 1ic6-vcp <dig> are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively.

prediction of ca2+ binding sites
the presence of ca2+ binding sites is a feature shared by members of the subtilisin-like family. it has been observed that ca2+ binding enhances the thermal stability of subtilisins which in turn increases their resistance to proteolysis  <cit> . there are two ca2+ binding sites in the high resolution crystal structure of 1ic <dig>  <cit> . the so-called strong binding site ca <dig> is formed by the oδ <dig> and oδ <dig> of asp <dig> and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of pro <dig> and val <dig>  this strong ca <dig> site is involved in stabilizing and bridging loops between β7-β <dig> and β8-β <dig>  ca <dig> is a weak binding site formed by the oδ <dig> and oδ <dig> of asp <dig> and the carbonyl oxygen atom of thr <dig>  this binding stabilizes the n- and c-terminal regions of the molecule. with regard to the ca <dig> site, residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are conserved among the four enzymes. the only exception is that val <dig> in 1ic <dig> is replaced by ala in pr <dig> and vcp <dig> . however, the carbonyl group of val <dig> coordinates the ca2+ and the replacement of val <dig> by ala should have a minor effect on calcium binding. it is likely, therefore, that this strong ca <dig> site should also be found in the structures of pr <dig> and vcp <dig> . figure 4a shows the superimposed ca <dig> sites of the four enzymes. with regard to the ca <dig> site, the thr <dig> in 1ic <dig> is replaced by arg in the three cuticle-degrading enzymes and the asp <dig> in 1ic <dig> is replaced by val in pr <dig> and ver <dig> and by ala in vcp <dig>  thus, the weak ca <dig> site is not likely present in the cuticle-degrading enzymes because val/ala <dig> contains no carboxyl side chain .

disulfide bridges
multiple sequence alignment and structural models suggest that there are two disulfide bridges occupying the same positions in each of the four proteases. one of the disulfide bridges, cys34–cys <dig>  connects β <dig> carrying the catalytic residue asp <dig> and a loop connecting α <dig> and β <dig>  although this loop is far away from the catalytic triad residues and substrate-binding regions, it links α <dig> located next to the substrate-binding segment 100– <dig> and β <dig> preceding the substrate-binding segment 132– <dig>  as a result, this loop may function as a "hinge" responsible for modulating the orientation of the substrate-binding segments. thus the cys34–cys <dig> can be thought to get involved in stabilizing the regions close to the catalytic residue asp <dig> and substrate-binding sites. in addition, an absolutely conserved salt bridge, asp117:arg <dig>  is also found to participate in stabilizing the "hinge" loop. the other disulfide bridge, cys178–cys <dig>  connecting β <dig> located next to the s <dig> pocket and α <dig> situated close to the c-terminus, makes the peripheral α <dig> anchor to the rest of the molecule and contributes to the stability of the c-terminal region. in addition, cys178–cys <dig> may also influence the orientation of the s <dig> residues via a loop comprising residues 171– <dig> 

hydrogen bonds and salt bridges
the numbers of hydrogen bonds/salt bridges in 1ic <dig>  pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig> are 223/ <dig>  189/ <dig>  189/ <dig>  and 195/ <dig>  respectively . hydrogen bonds play an important role in the overall stability of the protein due to their large number and wide distribution. in contrast, the contribution of salt bridges to protein stability is more localized  <cit> . in this paper, we mainly focus on the salt bridges that contribute to the stability of local structures, and on the number and type of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that are close to or within the substrate-binding sites.

a shared salt bridge network arg12:asp187:lys/arg <dig> is found in the three cuticle-degrading enzymes to participate in stabilizing the n-terminal region which is stabilized by ca <dig> in 1ic <dig>  another common salt bridge network, arg52:glu50:lyr/arg <dig>  is found in all four enzymes, connecting and stabilizing the surface loops between a 3/ <dig> helix  and β <dig> and between α <dig> and β <dig>  as described above, the absolutely conserved salt bridge, asp117:arg <dig>  together with the disulfide bridge cys34–cys <dig>  anchors and stabilizes the "hinge" loop. in 1ic <dig>  pr <dig> and vcp <dig>  there are two successive negatively charged residues, asp <dig> and glu/asp <dig>  in a loop connecting α <dig> and β <dig>  and these two residues can form at least two salt bridges with two successive positively charged residues, lys <dig> and lys <dig> in a loop connecting α <dig> and β <dig>  in contrast, ver <dig> contains just one salt bridge at the equivalent positions due to the replacement of the negatively charged residue at position  <dig> with a neutral residue, thr. in addition, a salt bridge asp112:arg <dig> is found in both 1ic <dig> and ver <dig> to bridge α <dig> and α <dig>  which are directly connected to the substrate-binding segments comprising residues 100– <dig> and 132– <dig>  although the negatively charged residues  are conserved among the four proteases, the replacement of arg <dig> with ala in both pr <dig> and vcp <dig> disrupts the formation of this salt bridge. in pr <dig> and vcp <dig>  a salt bridge network, lys250:asp254:lys <dig>  is found to participates in stabilizing the c-terminal helix α <dig>  however, only one salt bridge, arg250:asp <dig>  is found in α <dig> of 1ic <dig>  and no salt bridge is found in α <dig> of ver <dig>  interestingly, a common disulfide bond cys178–cys <dig> is found to participate in stabilizing the α <dig> in all four investigated protease models.

there are at least one positively charged residue, arg, and one negatively charged residue, asp, in a region comprising residues 162– <dig> which is part of, or in close vicinity to the s <dig> pocket. in this region, 1ic <dig> contains a salt bridge, asp165:arg <dig>  pr <dig> and ver <dig> share a salt bridge, asp162:arg <dig>  and vcp <dig> contains a salt bridge network comprising three residue, asp162:arg168:asp <dig>  the number of hydrogen bonds in this region is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in 1ic <dig>  pr <dig>  ver <dig>  and vcp <dig>  respectively. these salt bridges and hydrogen bonds contribute to the structural stability of this region and may cause the p <dig> residue of the substrate to adopt the correct orientation to facilitate nucleophilic attack by the ser. interestingly, the observed reduction in the hydrogen bond number within this region for vcp <dig> likely is compensated by the salt bridge networks involving the three residues, asp162:arg168:asp <dig> 

the charged residue clusters are found in a loop comprising residues 59– <dig> and in a region comprising residues 94– <dig>  the loop 59– <dig> preceding the catalytic residue his <dig> contains abundant polar residues and resides on the molecular surface, hereafter it is referred to as the polar surface loop . the loop 95– <dig> is part of, or in close proximity to the s <dig> site, and hereafter it is referred to as the s2-loop. in both pr <dig> and vcp <dig>  there is one salt bridge network, asp65:lyr94:asp <dig>  that bridges the psl and the s2-loop together and hence stabilizes them. in 1ic <dig> and ver <dig>  three salt bridge networks, asp65:lyr94:asp <dig>  asp65:lyr94:asp <dig> and arg64:asp98:lyr <dig> are responsible for stabilizing these two loops. interestingly, an absolutely conserved hydrogen bond network asp97- which participates in stabilizing the s2-loop is found in all the four enzymes. in addition to asp65:lyr <dig> and arg64:asp <dig>  another salt bridge involved in stabilizing the psl in 1ic <dig> and ver <dig> is glu43:arg <dig>  this salt bridge is not found in the pr <dig> and vcp <dig> due to the replacement of the arg <dig> by a neutral residue, asn or thr. furthermore, there is an absolutely conserved hydrogen network asp65- involved in stabilizing the psl in the four enzymes, and the number of hydrogen bonds participating in stabilizing the psl is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in 1ic <dig>  pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig>  respectively. taken together, it is thought that the abundant hydrogen bonds in combination with a small quantity of salt bridges provide determinants for the stabilization of the psl. it has also been observed that the psl can be stabilized by calcium in two proteinase k-like enzymes, the vprk from vibrio sp. pa <dig>   <cit>  and the thermitase from thermoactinomyces vulgaris   <cit> .

aromatic residues and interactions
clustered aromatic residues with potential interactions between them assist in enhancing the thermal stability of the protein  <cit> . aromatic residues that are conserved among the four enzymes are at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  out of them two absolutely conserved aromatic interactions, tyr23–tyr <dig> and tyr/phe59-phe/tyr <dig>  are found in all four protease models. the aromatic ring stack of tyr23–tyr <dig> can contribute to the stabilization of the n-terminal region, and tyr/phe59-phe/tyr <dig> can contribute to the stabilizations of the psl and α <dig>  the α <dig> is in close proximity to the substrate-binding segment 100– <dig>  a shared aromatic interaction, tyr36-phe/tyr <dig>  observed in 1ic <dig>  pr <dig> and ver <dig> can potentially contribute to the stabilizations of both β <dig> and β <dig>  however, this aromatic interaction does not occur in vcp <dig> due to the replacement of the aromatic residue phe or tyr at position  <dig> by leu in vcp <dig>  another aromatic interaction tyr60-tyr <dig> involved in stabilizing psl is found only in 1ic <dig> 

substrate-binding region and electrostatic surface potential
the substrate-binding region in subtilases can be described as a surface channel or crevice capable of accommodating at least six amino acid residues  of a polypeptide substrate or pseudo-substrate such as an inhibitor  <cit> . both the main chain and side chain interactions between the enzyme and the substrate/inhibitor contribute to binding  <cit> . in the crystal complex between proteinase k and methoxysuccinyl-ala-ala-pro-ala-chloromethyl ketone , the p4-p <dig> residues of the substrate slot in between the extended enzyme backbone segments 100– <dig> and 132– <dig> to form the central strand of a three-stranded antiparallel β sheet  <cit> . the leaving portion p1'–p2' of the substrate runs along the enzyme backbone segment 220– <dig> and appears to be less tightly bound. based on the multiple sequence alignment and crystal structures of 3prk and 1ic <dig>  the substrate-binding sites of the cuticle-degrading enzymes are characterized  and briefly described as follows.

the s2' site is a hydrophobic pocket formed primarily by residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the s <dig> is a distinct, large and elongated pocket that is primarily formed at the side and bottom by segments 132– <dig> and 158– <dig>  respectively. in addition, the s <dig> pocket is also surrounded at the rim by residue  <dig>  at the bottom end by  <dig>  and at the top by segment 222- <dig> carrying the nucleophilic residue ser <dig>  respectively. the s <dig> is a less distinct and smaller pocket than s <dig>  it is bounded at one side by residue  <dig> and at the other side by the active site residue his <dig>  at the bottom by both the hydrophobic residue  <dig> and the active site residue asp <dig>  at the bottom end by residue  <dig>  and at the rim by residue  <dig>  respectively. s <dig> is not a pocket because the side chain of the residue  at the s <dig> site points away from the substrate-binding region/surface, leading to the formation of a relatively protrudent patch on the protein surface . the other residue that may also get involved in the interaction with the p <dig> side chain is at a close position  <dig>  s <dig> is a very distinct pocket that is situated between two segments, 100– <dig> and 132– <dig>  this pocket appears to have two subsites, s4a and s4b. s4a has residues  <dig> and  <dig> at the bottom,  <dig> at the side, and  <dig> at the rim, respectively. s4b has residues  <dig> at the side,  <dig> at the bottom, and  <dig> and  <dig> at the rim, respectively. the side chains of these residues determine the size of the s <dig> pocket.

among the four investigated enzymes, the amino acid sequences in the substrate-binding sites of s2' and s <dig> are absolutely conserved but of s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> are relatively conserved. residue changes in the s <dig> pocket are found at positions  <dig> and  <dig> that are located at the rim and bottom end of this pocket, respectively. the neutral asn <dig> in 1ic <dig> is replaced by the acidic asp in the three fungal cuticle-degrading enzymes pr <dig>  vcp <dig>  and ver <dig>  although asn <dig> and asp <dig> are practically identical in conformation, the acidic residue asp <dig> would contribute to the more anionic characteristics of the s <dig> site in the cuticle-degrading enzymes , which in turn may shift the specificity to the basic p <dig> residues  <cit> . in addition, it has been observed that the anionic character can increase flexibility of an enzyme  <cit> , and in particular increase flexibility in the active site region  <cit> . we therefore suggest that asp <dig> in the cuticle-degrading enzymes would increase the flexibility of the s <dig> site, which in turn may enhance the catalytic efficiency of the cuticle-degrading enzymes and infection virulence by the fungi. position  <dig> is occupied by the tyr in 1ic <dig> and vcp <dig> but the thr in pr <dig> and ver <dig>  mutational studies on subtilisin bpn' have shown that p <dig> specificity can be dramatically modulated by substitution of residue at this position  <cit> . residue changes in the s <dig> site are only found at position  <dig> with replacement of the asn in 1ic <dig> by the his in pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig>  implying a preference of the cuticle-degrading enzymes for the negatively charged p <dig> residues at a low ph. the most obvious differences observed within the substrate-binding sites are located in the s <dig> pocket at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in which all four enzymes contain different amino acids. for example, the ser <dig> in the three cuticle-degrading enzymes in place of the gln <dig> in 1ic <dig> would enlarge the size of the s <dig> pocket due to its relatively smaller side chain than that of the gln. the tyr <dig> in pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and 1ic <dig> is observed to be replaced by the leu in ver <dig>  since previous studies have shown that the tyr <dig> forms a flexible lid to the s <dig> pocket  <cit>  of subtilases, we speculate that the leu <dig> in ver <dig> would broaden the entrance for p <dig> residues and simultaneously increase the hydrophobic property of the s <dig> pocket. the ile <dig> in 1ic <dig>  pr <dig> and ver <dig> is replaced by the val in vcp <dig> and the val <dig> in 1ic <dig>  pr <dig> and vcp <dig> is replaced by the leu in ver <dig>  these two substitutions likely have a minor influence on the size and hydrophobicity of the s <dig> pocket as ile/val <dig> and val/leu <dig> are largely buried at the s <dig> pocket bottom and are all hydrophobic residues. the substitution of pro <dig> in vcp <dig> for gly <dig> in 1ic <dig>  pr <dig> and ver <dig> results in a larger rim of the s <dig> pocket in vcp <dig> than in the other enzymes. in addition, the pro <dig> is located at the other side of the tyr <dig> with which a gate is formed at the entrance of the s <dig> pocket, as thus we speculate that the pro <dig> substitution may influence the entry of the p <dig> residues with large side chains. the hydropathy score reveals that the hydrophobic values of the s <dig> pockets in 1ic <dig>  pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig> are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicating that the s <dig> pockets in cuticle-degrading enzymes are more hydrophobic than in 1ic <dig> 

a notable difference in the surfaces of the proteins compared here is their different electrostatic surface potentials . large parts of the surface of pr <dig> and ver <dig> are positively charged, reflecting that these two proteases contain more positively charged residues than 1ic <dig> and vcp <dig> . although 1ic <dig> and vcp <dig> contain the same number of positive/negative residues , the negatively charged surfaces are relatively evenly dispersed on the positively charged or less charged surfaces in 1ic <dig> , whereas in vcp <dig> , the negatively charged surfaces are mainly concentrated on regions that are part of or in close vicinity to the substrate-binding sites, and the positively charged surfaces are concentrated on the other regions.

discussion
the 3d structural models of the three cuticle-degrading enzymes, pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig>  have been modeled using the homology modeling technique. according to baker and sali  <cit> , high-accuracy homology models with about  <dig>  Å rms error for the main-chain atoms can be obtained given more than 50% sequence identity to their templates, and the calculated models are comparable to the accuracy of a medium-resolution nmr or x-ray structure. since the sequence identities of the three cuticle-degrading enzymes to the template 1ic <dig> are all greater than 60% and there is no large insertion or deletion relative to 1ic <dig>  the modeled structures should be fairly accurate and can be used for predicting the ca2+ binding site, disulfide bridge, hydrogen bond, salt bridge, substrate specificity and catalytic activity. model assessments using the program procheck  <cit>  reveal that for structural models of pr <dig>  vcp <dig>  and ver <dig>  the residues located in the most favored regions of the ramachandran plot are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, and in the additionally allowed regions are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. only one residue, the arg <dig> in ver <dig> is located in the disallowed region. interestingly, this arg is located in a loop region  between α <dig> and β <dig>  and it can be replaced by gly in the isoform of ver <dig>  resulting in an amino acid polymorphism at position  <dig>  <cit> . the amino acid polymorphisms will be discussed below.

our analyses have shown that the three cuticle-degrading enzymes have not only similar physiochemical properties and optimal reaction conditions, but also highly comparable structural models with limited conformational differences observed in only some surface loops and the n-, c-termini. furthermore, they also show comparable geometrical properties and certain conserved structural features such as the calcium binding site, disulfide bridge, salt bridge and aromatic interaction which can contribute to the overall stability of the enzymes. in terms of calcium binding site, the three cuticle-degrading enzymes contain no ca <dig> that has been shown to stabilize the n- and c-terminal regions in 1ic <dig>  however, several hydrogen bonds and salt bridge networks observed within or close to the n- and c-terminal regions of the cuticle-degrading enzymes would be a substitution for the stabilizing effect by ca <dig> in 1ic <dig>  for example, two conserved hydrogen bond networks, arg12- and asp187-, and one conserved salt bridge network, arg12:asp187:lyr/arg <dig>  are found in the cuticle-degrading enzymes to participate in stabilizing the n-, c-termini . these results may explain why the presence of edta has a minor effect on the activity of these proteinase k-like proteases  <cit> . interestingly, the abundant hydrogen bonds and salt bridges involved in stabilizing psl of the cuticle-degrading enzymes may play an equivalent role as another calcium binding site found in 1sh <dig>  <cit>  and 1thm  <cit> .

although the total quantities of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are comparable among the three cuticle-degrading enzymes, the differences in their number, type, and distribution in regions that are part of or in close vicinity to the substrate-binding sites can have a significant effect on the local flexibility, which will influence the substrate binding, catalytic activity and substrate specificity of these enzymes. helland et al.  <cit>  has argued that a strong hydrogen bond network, asn97-, is able to bring the s2-loop of a proteinase k-like enzyme, sprk from the psychrotroph serratia species , into a 'hub and spokes' arrangement, which confers more rigidity to the s2-loop and reduces the binding affinity  of sprk towards the synthetic substrate suc-ala-ala-pro-phe-nitroanilide. in addition, the tight s2-loop is also able to influence the substrate specificity profile of sprk  <cit> . with regard to the three cuticle-degrading enzymes compared here, a conserved hydrogen bond network, asp97-, and a conserved salt bridge network, asp65:lyr94:asp <dig>  are found in the s2-loops. however, the number of hydrogen bonds involved in stabilizing the s2-loop is  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig>  respectively, and the number of salt bridges involved in stabilizing the s2-loop is  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in pr <dig>  vcp <dig>  and ver <dig>  respectively. therefore the s2-loop appears to be more rigid in ver <dig> than in the other two enzymes, and it is not unreasonable to believe that the relatively high rigidity of the s2-loop in ver <dig> would lead to the reduction in substrate affinity, which in turn would lower the catalytic efficiency for ver <dig> in comparison to pr <dig> and vcp <dig> 

in terms of substrate specificity, we have identified variable residues in the substrate-binding sites because any variation in specificity of subtilases is most likely to be caused by these variable residues, especially those residues whose side chains interact directly with the p <dig> and p <dig> residues of the substrate  <cit> . as previously mentioned, the substitution of asp <dig> in the three cuticle-degrading enzymes for asn in 1ic <dig> would not only enhance the catalytic efficiency but also shift the specificity to the basic p <dig> residues. the position  <dig> at the bottom end of the s <dig> pocket is occupied by either the tyr or thr in the four enzymes. although tyr is larger than thr, the s <dig> pocket in 1ic <dig> and vcp <dig> remains as wide as that in pr <dig> and ver <dig> as the side chains of these two residues rotate away from the s <dig> pocket bottom end . in addition, docking data has shown that this tyr in 1ic <dig> is not likely to interact directly with the p <dig> residue of a substrate  <cit> . for such interactions to occur, the side chain will have to rotate, and hence, cause steric clashes with the enzyme main chain that will require energy to resolve. taken together, we suggest that the residue substitution observed at position  <dig> may have a minor effect on substrate specificity for the three cuticle-degrading enzymes. on the contrary, the s <dig> site may contribute significantly to the substrate specificity because of the five observed variable residues in the s <dig> pocket. briefly, the cuticle-degrading enzymes have larger and more hydrophobic s <dig> pockets than that of the 1ic <dig>  the difference in size is mainly caused by the substitution of the smaller ser in the cuticle-degrading enzymes for gln in 1ic <dig> at position  <dig>  in addition, ver <dig> may have a preference for larger and more hydrophobic p <dig> residues than the other two cuticle-degrading enzymes due to the leu substitution for tyr at position  <dig>  and vcp <dig> may have a preference for relatively smaller p <dig> residues due to the pro substitution for gly at position  <dig>  furthermore, the differences in conformational flexibility of the substrate-binding regions may also contribute to substrate specificity due to the induced fit process of the substrate binding  <cit> . it is therefore reasonable to believe that the more rigid s2-loop in ver <dig> than in pr <dig> and vcp <dig> might cause variation in the specificity profile. it should be pointed out that, although the possible differences in substrate specificity between the three cuticle-degrading enzymes have been predicted from our models, more kinetic data with substrates which mimic the real "target" of the proteolytic attack should be obtained in order to verity these predictions.

the common electrostatic surface feature shared by the three cuticle-degrading enzymes is that their substrate-binding pockets are largely negatively charged while most of the other surfaces are positively charged. as mentioned above, the anionic feature of the substrate-binding regions would increase the local conformational flexibility of them, which in turn would enhance the catalytic efficiency. in addition, the large patches of the positively charged surfaces increase the adsorption of the cuticle-degrading enzymes to cuticles carrying abundant acidic residues  <cit> , and also explain why the cuticle-degrading enzymes studied here are all alkaline proteases.

some isoforms of pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig> carrying the amino acid polymorphism sites have been cloned and sequenced. for example, up to  <dig> residue variations within pr <dig> of several isolates from different hosts have been detected  <cit> . in addition, the number of the amino acid polymorphisms detected for vcp <dig> and ver <dig> is  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. however, no polymorphism has been found at the catalytic residue triad of the asp, his and ser, indicating a strong selective pressure for the maintenance of the structure/function of this site. some of the polymorphisms observed near the substrate-binding regions may have effects on the substrate utilization, kinetics or surface property of the enzymes  <cit> . it has been suggested that the abundant polymorphisms within pr <dig> may render its isoforms recalcitrant to some of the antiproteolytic hemolymphal peptides and could enable the pathogenic fungus m. anisopliae to exploit a wider range of substrates  <cit> . for vcp <dig>  its two polymorphism sites are observed at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the polymorphism at position  <dig> is the replacement of an acidic residue, glu in the root knot nematode isolates by a neutral residue, gln in the cyst nematode isolates. this substitution is far away from the substrate-binding regions and may have a negligible influence on the local conformation because the glu is similar in size to gln. however, this substitution reduces the negative charge of the vcp <dig> isoform which in turn enhances enzyme adsorption to the acidic cuticles  <cit> . the other polymorphism at position  <dig> is the replacement of a gly in the root knot nematode isolates by an ala in the cyst nematode isolates. this replacement is situated in the s2-loop and we speculate that the smaller gly in vcp <dig> isoforms from the root knot nematode isolates would increase flexibility of the s2-loop and reduce steric hindrance of the larger p <dig> and p <dig> residues with corresponding substrate-binding sites, the s <dig> and s <dig>  indeed, substrate utilization assays  <cit>  reveal that vcp <dig> isoforms from the root knot nematode isolates have a higher activity towards suc-ala-val-pro-phe-pna than towards suc-ala-ala-pro-phe-pna. as mentioned above, only one polymorphism at position  <dig> has been found so far in ver <dig>  this polymorphism is the replacement of the arg <dig> in isolates l. psalliotae  <dig> and  <dig> by the gly in isolate l. psalliotae  <dig>  <cit> . on the one hand, arg <dig> increases the positive charge of vcp <dig>  which in turn enhances the adsorption of the enzyme to the negatively charged nematode cuticle. on the other hand, arg <dig> is located in the 'hinge' loop that is responsible for modulation of the orientation of the substrate-binding segments 100– <dig> and 132– <dig>  although the "hinge" loop is stabilized by the disulfide bridge cys34–cys <dig> and the salt bridge asp117:arg <dig>  arg <dig> may make it unstable due to the large size of arg and no apparent negatively charged complementary residue being found to form the salt bridge. we speculate, therefore, that the arg <dig> would make the "hinge" loop more flexible and influence the orientation of the substrate-binding segments  and the catalytic activity. however, more kinetic data should be obtained to clarify these effects. in addition, the host related amino acid polymorphism in pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig> between different isolates may also contribute to host preference by fungi.

CONCLUSIONS
the 3d structural models of the three cuticle-degrading proteases, pr <dig>  vcp <dig> and ver <dig>  have been modeled using the homology modeling technique. these models reported here are very similar to each other and to the template structure of 1ic <dig>  with restricted conformational differences found only in certain surface loops and the n-, c-termini. these structures share the common disulfide bridges and similar calcium binding sites, physiochemical properties, optimal reaction conditions and high sequence identities. these similarities support the initial hypotheses that the three cuticle-degrading enzymes belong to the proteinase k-like serine protease family. these enzymes secreted by nematophagous and entomophagous fungi can be considered to be general-purpose proteases because they are required either for degrading cuticles or for growth on purified proteinaceous cuticles. however, the variable residues observed within the substrate-binding sites and the different conformational flexibilities in the s2-loop can be expected to cause variation in substrate specificity as well as in catalytic activity. the host related amino acid polymorphisms observed for these cuticle-degrading enzymes are not only of great interest to the functional pathology of fungi, but also to future exploitation of these fungi as biocontrol agents.
