BACKGROUND
long-branch attraction  is a bias that results in spurious support for relationships between two  long branches in an estimated phylogenetic tree when the assumed model of evolution is too simplistic  <cit> . biases associated with lba have been identified in many phylogenetic studies, including analyses of mammals  <cit> , birds  <cit> , arthropods  <cit> , and seed plants  <cit> . the most common problem occurs when distantly related ingroup taxa are poorly sampled and one or a few distant outgroup taxa are included to root the tree. under these conditions, a simplistic model of evolution is unlikely to sufficiently account for homoplasy, and long branches will be connected  in the inferred tree based on homoplastic similarities  <cit> . one method for detecting this problem involves conducting phylogenetic analyses with and without outgroups  <cit> . if the inclusion of a distant outgroup changes the inferred relationships of the ingroup, it may be better to infer ingroup relationships separately and consider other methods for rooting the resulting tree, or to use more closely related outgroups  <cit> . in addition, several strategies have been suggested to reduce the effects of lba, including:  excluding long-branch taxa from the analysis,  replacing the long-branch taxa with slow-evolving close relatives,  removing fast-evolving proteins or sites,  improving the models of character evolution assumed in the analysis, and  sampling more taxa to break up long branches in the tree  <cit> . among these methods, adding taxa to break up long branches is one of the most widely suggested strategies to reduce the effects of lba bias  <cit> . appropriate and thorough taxon sampling is thus one of the most important considerations for accurate phylogenetic estimation  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses based on relatively few distantly related taxa  are particularly prone to problems with lba; such analyses are likely to produce high support values for incorrect phylogenetic relationships  <cit> .

the relationships of the true water bugs  within heteropteran insects  <cit>  have been the subject of many studies of molecular and morphological data. the monophyly of nepomorpha has been consistently and strongly supported by studies based on morphological characters  <cit> , molecular data , and by combined data analyses  <cit> . in contrast, the monophyly of nepomorpha has only been disputed in the study of hua et al.  <cit> , who based their analysis on nine nepomorphan mitochondrial genomes . in the study by hua et al.  <cit> , pleoidea was not supported as part of nepomorpha, but instead was resolved as the sister-group of a clade that included the remaining species of nepomorpha plus leptopodomorpha, cimicomorpha, and pentatomomorpha . as a result of these analyses, hua et al.  <cit>  suggested that pleoidea should be raised from a superfamily within nepomorpha to the infraorder plemorpha, outside of nepomorpha. their conclusions were supported by high bayesian posterior probabilities  and maximum likelihood  bootstrap proportions in five of eight phylogenetic analyses.

the study by hua et al.  <cit>  has both strengths and weaknesses when compared with previous studies of the phylogenetic relationships of nepomorpha. each taxon sampled by hua et al.  <cit>  was sampled for complete mitochondrial genomes, so the number of characters available for phylogenetic inference was large. in contrast, previous studies  <cit>  examined fewer characters per taxon, but included more taxa in the analyses. thorough taxon sampling can often lead to more accurate phylogenetic inference, even if the total number of characters in the analysis is decreased  <cit> . in particular, the position of pleoidea in the study of hua et al.  <cit>  may have been affected by the inclusion of just one of two families in pleoidea . this made it more likely for the tree to be rooted by connection of the distantly related outgroup taxa to the long branch leading to helotrephes sp. .

a second consideration is the selection of outgroups used by hua et al.  <cit> . fulgoromorpha is very distantly related to the ingroup nepomorpha, making problems associated with lba more likely  <cit> . furthermore, in groups more closely related to nepomorpha, hua et al.  <cit>  sampled only one representative for three different infraorders . thus, we examined the possibility that the findings of hua et al.  <cit>  resulted from biases associated with inadequate taxon sampling. because the model-based methods used by hua et al.  <cit>  are less sensitive to the problems of lba  <cit> , these authors did not consider lba to be a likely explanation of their results. however, models of evolution are never perfect, and poor taxon sampling exacerbates the problems of model insufficiency, so the use of model-based inference methods is not, by itself, a panacea for dealing with biases associated with lba  <cit> .

we undertook the current study to explore the conclusion of hua et al.  <cit>  that the pleoidea evolved their fully aquatic lifestyle independently of the remaining true water bugs in nepomorpha. our hypothesis was that this conclusion was a result of lba between the single sampled representative of pleoidea and the distantly related outgroup, fulgoromorpha. we tested this hypothesis by:  removing the outgroups and re-estimating the phylogeny of nepomorpha only, to detect whether the ingroup topology is affected by the long-branch outgroup taxa  <cit> ;  increasing taxon sampling of groups related to nepomorpha, including leptopodomorpha, cimicomorpha, and pentatomomorpha  <cit> ; and  adding new mt-genome data for a representative of the second family within pleoidea, namely pleidae .

RESULTS
misidentification of previously sampled taxa
to test our hypothesis that the conclusion of hua et al.  <cit>   was an artifact of limited taxon sampling, we sampled a member of the family helotrephidae. helotrephidae is generally accepted as the sister-group of pleidae  <cit> , so we reasoned that including the sister-group of pleidae was the best way to break up the long terminal branch leading to this taxon. we sequenced the mt-genome of helotrephes semiglobosus semiglobosus stål,  <dig> . however, after we obtained a partial mt-genome sequence of helotrephes semiglobosus semiglobosus  with the length of  <dig>  bp, including  <dig> genes  as well as the control region, we found extreme similarity  between this species and the specimen previously identified by hua et al.  <cit>  as paraplea frontalis . as this level of sequence similarity was unexpected between species in these two families, we checked the specimens identified previously as paraplea frontalis by hua et al.  <cit> . we found that those specimens are properly identified as helotrephes sp., and so represent a species in helotrephidae rather than pleidae. as the mt-genome of a species in helotrephidae was already represented in the data set, we then sequenced a new mt-genome of paraplea frontalis, as a true representative of pleidae. henceforth, we label the sample sequenced by hua et al.  <cit>  correctly as helotrephes sp..

removal of outgroups from the analysis
the most common problem of lba is that distantly related outgroups have a biased attraction to long branches within the ingroup  <cit> . for this reason, a common suggestion is to conduct phylogenetic analyses both with and without the outgroups to compare whether the distantly related outgroup alters the ingroup topology  <cit> . to test if outgroup selection affected the topology of our ingroup, we ran analyses using only the ingroup taxa of hua et al.  <cit> . using bayesian and ml analyses, all data matrices of hua et al.  <cit>  generated phylogenetic trees with the same topology . when the outgroups are removed, the ingroup topology is distinct from that obtained by hua et al.  <cit>  . in all of these analyses, helotrephes sp. was connected to enithares tibialis liu et zheng,  <dig> .

addition of outgroups
outgroup selection is an important factor for reconstructing phylogenetic trees, because the choice of outgroup taxa can affect the ingroup topology  <cit> . however, outgroup selection is often not adequately considered  <cit> . moreover, several authors have pointed out that adding more outgroup taxa in the sister-group to a phylogenetic analysis can improve the accuracy of phylogenetic estimation, and also should help break up the lba between any long-branch members of the ingroup and the outgroup  <cit> . therefore, we added three more taxa  to the dataset of hua et al.  <cit> .

both bayesian inference and ml analyses resulted in the same topology ; the position of the long branch of helotrephes sp.  was supported within nepomorpha rather than outside of nepomorpha, in contrast to the findings of hua et al.  <cit> . the monophyly of nepomorpha  received strong support in bayesian analyses  but with relatively weak support in ml analyses . the monophyletic nepoidea, ochteroidea, and naucoroidea were strongly supported by both pp and bp, similar to the results of hua et al.  <cit> . additionally, the topology of the infraordinal relationships of heteroptera is similar to previous work  <cit>  also based on mt-genomes, namely ))).

we also estimated phylogenetic trees without the long-branched outgroup of lycorma delicatula  . the major changes that resulted from deletion of this taxon were the position of helotrephes sp. and naucoroidea . in both bayesian and ml analyses, helotrephes sp.  was supported as the sister group of enithares tibialis . the close relationship between the notonectoidea and pleoidea also has been supported in most previous studies  <cit> . although the relationships among families of nepomorpha varied among trees, all the analyses that excluded fulgoromorpha supported the monophyly of nepomorpha . these analyses demonstrate that the conclusions of hua et al.  <cit>  were at least partly a result of their use of a very distant outgroup.

addition of a new mitochondrial genome of pleidae
we sequenced and assembled a new mt-genome for paraplea frontalis , except for small portions of 12s rrna gene and the control region . this mt-genome was  <dig>  bp in length and has been deposited in the genbank . the mt-genome of paraplea frontalis contained the typical  <dig> genes , with the same gene order as observed in most other true bugs  <cit>  . gene overlaps were found at  <dig> gene junctions and involved a total of 32 bp, which may make the genome relatively compact. twelve of the  <dig> pcgs initiated with atn as start codon, whereas the coi gene started with ttg. eight pcgs ended with the termination codon taa and one with tag, whereas the remaining four were terminated with t. all of the  <dig> typical animal trna genes were observed in the paraplea frontalis mt-genome, ranging from  <dig> to 74 bp. most of the trnas could be folded into typical cloverleaf secondary structures, except that the stem of the dihydrouridine  arm simply formed a loop in trna-ser  . there are  <dig> unmatched base pairs in the paraplea frontalis mitochondrial trna secondary structures.

anumbers correspond to nucleotides separating a gene from an upstream one; negative numbers indicate that adjacent genes overlap.

increased taxon sampling, especially when it breaks up long branches in a tree, is the most effective strategy for reducing the effects of lba  <cit> . we added the representative of pleidae, which is thought to be the sister-group of helotrophidae, to help reduce the length of the branch that led to the single sampled species of helotrephidae sampled by hua et al.  <cit> . we therefore added our mt-genome of paraplea frontalis to the four data matrices of hua et al.  <cit>  and conducted new phylogenetic analyses .

as with our analyses that replaced the distant outgroup with more appropriate outgroups, the analyses that included a member of pleidae supported monophyly of nepomorpha . moreover, these analyses strongly supported paraplea frontalis  as the sister group of helotrephes sp. . together, pleidae and helotrephidae were supported as the sister-group of notonectidae. the monophyletic groups of nepoidea, ochteroidea, naucoroidea, pleoidea, and notonectoidea + pleoidea were strongly supported by both pp and bp in all analyses that included pleidae.

likelihood-ratio tests
we compared the likelihood ratios of the best solutions for each of our two alternative hypotheses  for eight different combinations of taxa . the monophyly of nepomorpha  was strongly supported if we added paraplea frontalis and/or three more outgroup taxa to the original data matrix of hua et al.  <cit> , as well as when we analyzed the data set without the distant outgroup consisting of lycorma delicatula. the original conclusion of hua et al.  <cit>   was only supported with the specific combination of taxa analyzed in the original study. even then, the likelihood-ratio support for this result over the alternative is weak .

phylogeny of nepomorpha
given that the monophyly of nepomorpha is consistently supported in all of our new analyses, we find no support for the new infraorder plemorpha. therefore, we recommend retaining pleoidea as part of nepomorpha. the superfamilies of nepoidea , ochteroidea , naucoroidea , and pleoidea  are monophyletic groups in all our analyses with high support from both pp and bp. we also found strong support for the close relationship between notonectoidea and pleoidea. several synapomorphies of biological and ecological traits also support some of these monophyletic groups  <cit> :

nepomorpha: the short antennae are concealed below the eyes; all have an aquatic lifestyle, although ochteroidea  live along freshwater shores rather than underwater;

nepoidea : air-breathing through a siphon;

naucoroidea: all aphelocheiridae and some naucoridae use plastron respiration;

pleoidea : also have plastron respiration, which allows them to stay permanently submerged;

notonectoidea and pleoidea : swim on their backs in an inverted position.

our principal goal in this study was to discuss the monophyly of nepomorpha and the effects of adequate taxon sampling on this phylogenetic problem. as we did not sample all the families of nepomorpha, a more thorough sampling of taxa is needed to adequately resolve the family relationships within nepomorpha. in particular, more sampling of potamocoridae, micronectidae and diaprepocoridae  mt-genome sequences will be needed for a thorough analysis of the major groups within nepomorpha.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a clear example of the importance of adequate sampling. we support the conclusion that investigators should be cautious about making major taxonomic rearrangements on the basis of limited taxon sampling, even  when the number of characters sampled per taxon is large  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses that are based on even complete genomes of relatively few taxa are likely to result in strongly supported, but incorrect, evolutionary reconstructions  <cit> . in the study by hua et al.  <cit> , limited sampling of mt-genomes, coupled with the use of a distant outgroup, resulted in a conclusion that was at odds with a traditionally supported group . but even minimal additional sampling to break up long branches in the tree, or the use of more closely related outgroups, results in trees in which the traditional group nepomorpha is supported.

in the phylogenomic era  <cit> , many papers are reporting surprising phylogenetic results that conflict with traditional hypotheses of relationships. many  of these surprising results are based on analyses of many characters  from very few taxa  <cit> . strong “statistical support” for a given conclusion may come from strong underlying phylogenetic signal, but also from systematic bias that stems from assuming inadequate or inappropriate models of evolution  <cit> . using large numbers of characters in a phylogenetic analysis means that even small systematic biases associated with overly simplistic methodological assumptions are likely to be mistaken as strong phylogenetic signal. thorough taxon sampling allows the use of more simplistic models of evolution, because multiple changes at each nucleotide site can be appropriately reconstructed through the increased sampling of the tree  <cit> . if the sampling in a phylogenomic study is sparse, investigators should use appropriate caution before overturning analyses that are based on more thorough sampling of taxa.
