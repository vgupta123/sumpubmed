BACKGROUND
western white pine  is an economically and ecologically important forest tree species with wide distribution across western north america. wwp faces serious conservation challenges due to its susceptibility to white pine blister rust , caused by the exotic fungus cronartium ribicola j.c. fisch., and its high vulnerability to other disturbance agents including the mountain pine beetle  and fire, both of which are exacerbated by climate change  <cit> . today, due largely to wpbr, p. monticola exists in fragmented populations that occupy less than  <dig> percent of this species’ historical landscape  <cit> . other five-needle pines, such as whitebark pine  and limber pine , are subjected to similar conservation challenges  <cit> . while development of genetic resistance of wwp and other related species to wpbr is underway in several operational programs  <cit> , better understanding of the genetic diversity, population structure, gene flow, and disease and insect resistance of five-needle pines is critical to their proper management, conservation, and restoration.

in the past decade or so, molecular markers have been developed and used to facilitate conservation and wpbr resistance breeding programs  <cit> . analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism  markers has revealed that wpbr disease pressure and selection directed by diverging climates have influenced genetic diversity among wwp populations in different geographical regions  <cit> . several aflp markers have been shown to be tightly linked with wwp major gene  resistance against wpbr  <cit> . more recently, nucleotide diversity has been investigated through pcr-sequencing of candidate genes under adaptation of host defense response  <cit> . progress in association genetics has led to the identification of single nucleotide polymorphism  and simple sequence repeat  markers of a few candidate genes associated with quantitative disease resistance traits  <cit> . despite these advances, the application of genomic resources, such as high-throughput markers  and genotyping arrays, remains scarce for wwp and other five-needle pines as these species are quite evolutionarily distant from the few conifers with available draft genome sequences and related genomic information  <cit> .

to develop effective, long term management strategies for wwp and wpbr, ongoing research is needed to improve understanding of the influence that climate and environmental factors have in changing and shaping p. monticola populations. to achieve this objective and realistically score individual genotypes using inexpensive high-throughput techniques, a large number of molecular markers that are easy to score on a large number of wwp populations are needed. while snp markers are abundant in the genome and have the potential to be excellent tools for these research objectives, to date there is no snp database or snp arrays available for wwp.

next generation sequencing  strategies for high-throughput snp discovery and genotyping include restriction-site-associated dna tags - rad  <cit> , genotyping by-sequencing - gbs  <cit> , and multiplexed-shotgun genotyping - msg  <cit> . rna-seq is also an important genomic technology for discovery of a large number of dna markers, including snp and ssr at transcriptome level. because rna-seq produces short cdna sequence reads targeting at exoms and mainly at protein coding regions, dna variations associated with phenotypic traits are more easily linked to biological roles for functional characterization of candidate genes than would occur using genomic dna-based approaches. rna-seq has wide application to ecological and evolutionary research and it is well suited to understanding speciation and eco-type-specific adaptation by revealing differences in gene expression patterns between populations  <cit> 

the objective of this study was 1) to characterize the transcriptome of tree shoot tissues from resistance germplasm, 2) to develop snp markers based on a candidate gene approach, and 3) to apply high-throughput snp genotyping to the reconstruction of pedigrees and resistance screening in wwp conservation and breeding programs. we used rna-seq for snp discovery in the transcriptome de-novo assembled from shoot-tip tissues based on bulked segregation of major gene resistance  and susceptibility  to c. ribicola. the snp assay was designed based on candidate genes related to disease resistance and pinus highly conserved genes . those snps validated here by high-throughput genotyping in a collection of resistance germplasm improve the genomic tools available for wwp and other five-needle pines.

RESULTS
de-novo assembly of shoot-tip transcriptome
construction of six cdna libraries from pooled rna samples representing wpbr resistant and susceptible genotypes enabled us to generate and gain a global view of the transcriptome in the shoot tip tissues of p. monticola. a total of  <dig>  million 100-bp paired-end reads were collected from the six cdna libraries, which represents sequencing data of approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  million paired-end  reads per library. a total of  <dig>  unique contigs with n <dig> of 920-bp and average length of 630-bp were produced by de-novo assembly with  <dig> million rna-seq 100-bp pe reads from three cdna libraries constructed from resistant tissues .

 <dig>  transcripts were extracted from the assembly with read count ≥  <dig> per contig, or read count <  <dig> per contig but with blastn e <  <dig> e- <dig> when searched against the pinus gene index  database . all these contigs were used as the shoot-tip reference transcriptome for further analysis, which had a total length of 46 mb, n <dig> of  <dig> -bp, and average length of 843-bp . blastn analysis of the shoot-tip reference transcriptome revealed that it contained  <dig>  contigs  as pinus hcgs, since they showed identical hits  to the pgi database. from this reference transcriptome, a total of  <dig>  proteins were predicted by transdecoder with minimum protein length of  <dig>  of all putative proteins,  <dig>   were putatively complete protein sequences . the wwp shoot-tip reference transcriptome with  <dig>  contigs has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under accession gbqx <dig> 

of  <dig>  putative proteins derived from wwp shoot-tip reference transcriptome,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of them showed significant similarity to the pgi database and loblolly pine  genome database respectively . tblastn search of p. taeda protein database  against wwp sequences revealed that  <dig> % of them had significant homology hits  in wwp shoot-tip reference transcriptome . in contrast, only  <dig> wwp shoot-tip transcripts  showed identical hits in the poplar leaf rust fungus  genome , suggesting rare fungal infections in the resistant tissues .

gene annotation
gene ontology analysis was performed for  <dig>  transcripts in the wwp shoot-tip reference transcriptome using blast2go,  <dig> % of them showed significant blastx hits in the ncbi nr database. all blast top-hit species were plants except one fungal species botrytis cinerea, and picea sitchensis accounted for  <dig> % of the total contigs while b. cinerea accounted for only  <dig> % of the total contigs , suggesting that contamination was not a serious problem in the data set of wwp shoot-tip reference transcriptome.  <dig>  contigs  were assigned to at least one go term, and  <dig>  of them encoded for putative enzymes. as compared with wwp primary needle reference transcriptome  <cit> , significant enrichment of a series of go term categories was found and in general, sequences under these categories were significantly over-represented in the shoot-tip tissues . for example, under category of “response to biotic stimulus”,  <dig> genes were expressed in shoot-tip tissues and only  <dig> genes were expressed in primary needle tissues, suggesting difference of basal defense between these two types of wwp tissues.

seven hundred and forty-five contigs in the shoot-tip reference transcriptome were identified as resistance gene analogs  encoding proteins with domains of nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeats  by blastx search against  <dig> wwp rgas cloned previously  <cit> . a set of differentially expressed genes  was identified in p. monticola needle tissues in host defence in response to c. ribicola infection at early stage  <cit> ,  <dig> of them were detected to be expressed in shoot-tips. we selected genes of these three groups hcgs, rgas, and degs as reference sequences in mapping of rna-seq reads for further snp discovery.

snp discovery and characterization
using clc genomics workbench  <dig>  to map pe reads of the six cdna libraries to the reference sequences,  <dig>  indels,  <dig>  multi-nucleotide variants , and  <dig>  bi-allelic snps were mapped to  <dig>  putative protein-coding regions,  <dig>  snps  resulted in an amino acid change . we also detected  <dig>  snps in the hcg group,  <dig>  in deg group, and  <dig>  in the rga group . these snps, which totalled  <dig> , were distributed across  <dig>  contigs with one snp per 263-bp on average in three candidate groups. hcgs showed the lowest snp density at one snp per 285-bp . degs and rgas had intermediate and high snp densities at one snp per 126-bp and 81-bp  respectively. polymorphic genes accounted for 61%, 83%, and 84% of the total genes in the candidate groups of hcgs, degs, and rgas respectively .figure  <dig>

a total of  <dig>  hcgs were polymorphic. a detailed examination of snp distribution revealed that  <dig> %  of these hcgs were polymorphic in both resistant and susceptible samples while  <dig> %  of hcgs were found to be polymorphic only in susceptible seedlings and  <dig> %  of hcgs were found to be polymorphic only in resistant seedlings. the remaining  <dig> %  of polymorphic hcgs were homozygous but their alleles were different between resistant and susceptible samples . snp sites present only in resistant or only in susceptible seedlings were considered the highest priority snp sites for genotyping verification to identify resistant trait-associated dna markers.figure  <dig>

snp genotyping
two different genotyping assays tested a total of  <dig> in-silico snp loci in  <dig> seedlings by the sequenom iplex technology. within the first  snp array, nine genomic dna samples were removed from genotyping analysis due to too many missing data, resulting in a sample size of n =  <dig>  analysis of each snp locus for the three genotypes  found that  <dig> snps  were successfully genotyped while the remaining  <dig> snps  were scored as ‘failed’ due to missing genotype data in more than 20% of all samples; poor pcr amplification and low signal intensities resulted in missing data.

as summarized in table  <dig>  out of the  <dig> snp loci that were genotyped with a signal,  <dig>  were monomorphic and the other  <dig>  were verified as polymorphic among the genotyped samples . for each snp locus, observed  and expected levels of heterozygosity  under hardy–weinberg equilibrium , and significance level for the test for departures from hwe, are shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>  a large proportion of snp markers,  <dig> in the 1st array and  <dig> in the second  array, were identified to be deviated significantly from hwe at p <  <dig>  with bonferroni-correction, probably due to breeding selection of the resistant germplasm from natural populations.table  <dig>

the distributions of minor allele frequency  and ho for the polymorphic loci were similar in two genotyping arrays . the mean hos for all  <dig> polymorphic snp markers were estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the 1st and 2nd snp arrays, respectively. the candidate group of hcgs had the highest successful rate for conversion of in-silico snp loci into snp markers  while this rate was only  <dig> % for the candidate group of rgas. in total,  <dig> snps showed a maf >  <dig>  in the sets of tested seedlings. the twelve snps that had the highest ho level of 100% were excluded for population genetics analysis. thus, a final genotypic data set consisting of  <dig> snp loci was used for pedigree reconstruction and ld analysis.

population structure and full sibship reconstruction
principal component analysis  showed that the first three principal components explained approximately 60% of the total variation and clear ancestry clusters displayed within the collected samples . investigation of population structure with the model-based bayesian clustering method in structure showed that the most likely number of clusters  was  <dig> using the Δk calculation . four genetic clusters were consistently uncovered by two different sampling in the resistant germplasm in the 1st and 2nd snp arrays .figure  <dig>

using colony to reconstruct sibship and parentage by the most accurate method of full-likelihood, we found that  <dig> seedlings in the 1st snp array and  <dig> seedlings in the 2nd snp array were assigned into  <dig> and  <dig> full-sib seed families respectively. both snp assays revealed the three most abundant seed families, each of which accounted for >10% of the total genotyped samples . these results were largely supported by the known pedigrees and origins of these seedlings in the resistance germplasm collected from breeding programs. the seed family with least members was assigned with only one seedling.

linkage disequilibrium  analysis
a total of  <dig>  snp pairs were compared for ld estimates. chi-squared tests  showed significant ld estimates for  <dig> snp pairs , but this pair number was reduced to  <dig>  with an average ld estimate at r2 =  <dig>  after a highly conservative bonferroni correction for multiple tests . when major gene resistance genotypes  were considered in the ld analysis, we detected  <dig> snps  in significant lds with cr <dig>  after bonferroni correction, six genes still showed significant lds with cr <dig>  including three rgas , two hcgs, and one deg . despite not knowing their genetic distances, snp loci with significant ld may share locations on the same chromosomes. the snp of the deg a05_contig_ <dig> was shown to be tightly associated with major gene  resistance . for this snp marker, cc, gc, and gg genotypes accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the total resistant seedlings; and 0%,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the total susceptible seedlings. this snp locus thus is an excellent marker for cr2-resistance selection across four populations in wwp germplasm.figure  <dig>

discussion
snp discovery by a modified rna-seq approach
without requirement of pre-existing genomic sequence data, rna-seq has been shown to have an increasing range of applications in the discovery of novel genes, transcripts, rnas, alternative splice junctions, fused sequences, and nucleotide variations  in non-model species  <cit> . by integrating regular rna-seq with bulked segregation analysis, we demonstrate that this approach is an effective strategy for selecting snps with high potential to identify dna variations associated with adaptive traits at transcriptome level in wwp. a recent study found that  <dig> individuals were needed for accurate allele frequency prediction by rna-seq approach  <cit> . coincidentally, our work used six bulked samples  and recovered a total of ~ <dig>  high quality snps by mapping of  <dig>  million rna-seq reads against three sets of candidate genes under a series of stringent detection criteria. availability of these novel in-silico snps would help provide a large amount of dna markers for breeding and conservation programs of this important conifer species.

the sequenom iplex has been reported as one of highly reliable high-throughput snp genotyping platforms with wide applications  <cit> . we adapted it for wwp snp genotyping due to a more cost-effective and flexible nature of this technology. snp marker conversion rates from in-silico snps to validated loci have been reported for maritime pine  , lodgepole pine  , aleppo pine  , and douglas fir   <cit> . the present study revealed an average conversion rate of  <dig> % in p. monticola. the hcg group showed a much higher conversion rate of  <dig> %; this rate is comparable to those snps mined by genomic re-sequencing in other tree species  <cit> . variation in snp marker conversion rates suggests criteria for in-silico snp selection and genotyping design, as well as types of genotyping platforms are important. for example, the in-silico snp-mining process with stringent quality criteria can distinguish sequence variations from sequencing artefacts. it is possible that the rate of conversion of in-silico snps can be improved even more in wwp by optimizing primer design and pcr amplification conditions because we found that some iplex failed snps could be genotyped properly by qpcr genotyping methods such taqman and hrm . identification of exon-intron boundaries by exome sequencing will improve design of snp genotyping arrays. furthermore, as compared to sample-pooling strategy, snp detection by ngs on individual samples, especially on haploid megagametophyte samples in conifer, has potential to increase overall confidence for in-silico snp detection.

our work demonstrates how combining bulked segregation-based rna-seq with high-throughput snp arrays enables fast, cost-effective, and yet reliable identification of the most informative  markers among hundreds of thousands of in-silico snps. we believe that this cost-effective approach for detecting the most informative snps can be readily adapted and applied to other non-model conifers, including five-needle pine species ,

candidate gene-based snp array
in the present study we demonstrated the utility of candidate-based approach for selection of a subset of available in-silico snps: first, rna-seq-based transcriptome profiling identified wwp candidate genes  having potential biological functions in genetic resistance and host defense against attack by pests, pathogens, and environmental stresses; second, transcriptome profiling also revealed highly conserved genes, even orthologous genes, in conifer species  <cit> . because rgas and degs are excellent targets for investigating plant-microbe-environment interactions and hcgs are the most favourable choices for comparative genomics study across related taxa, then we selected snps of these candidate groups to develop high-throughput genotyping assays. while snps represent a genetic variability of individual at the finest level, if a significant number of snps are available, it is not necessary to genotype all the available snps throughout the whole genome. selection of a subset of snps that is sufficiently informative but still small enough for the best balance of affordable cost and research objectives is an important step toward effective association studies and genomic selection  <cit> .

a few candidate gene-based case studies have found snps and haplotypes associated with quantitative traits in conifers  <cit>  and in other plant species  <cit> . using ld analysis, in this study we identified a defense-responsive gene a05_contig_ <dig> as being one associated with the cr <dig> gene . a05_contig_ <dig> encodes an f-box protein that has high homology with the p. taeda protein aew <dig> and its expressed transcript was specifically up-regulated in the primary needles of resistant seedlings after c. ribicola infection  <cit> . f-box proteins contain at least one f-box domain that is commonly linked with other motifs such as lrrs and tryptophan-aspartic acid  repeats for protein–protein interactions associated with signal transduction networks and other cellular functions  <cit> .

despite the disadvantages of relatively low read-mapping coverage and high polymorphism levels, we included in-silico snps of  <dig> rgas in the sequenom iplex assay. genotyping of rga snps is more likely to identify genetic associations with disease resistance traits due to their putative functions in plant innate immune systems. plant nbs-lrr and rlk proteins mainly function in host resistance by specific interactions with pathogen effectors, which trigger plant defense responses that inhibit pathogen growth and spread inside infected tissues  <cit> . we previously identified over one hundred rgas of the nbs-lrr and rlks in p. monticola by genomic pcr cloning and several rga-related aflp markers linked to cr <dig> in genetic mapping populations  <cit> . here we revealed that  <dig> unique rga transcripts were expressed in the shoot-tip tissues and ~  <dig>  in-silico snps were identified in their sequences. of  <dig> rgas genotyped successfully,  <dig> of them showed polymorphism . three polymorphic rgas were identified in significant association with major gene  resistance by ld analysis in the genotyped populations . the rga f0_contig_ <dig> encoded a putative rlk protein with highest homology to the picea glauca protein abf <dig>  , and another two rgas, f0_contig_ <dig> and f0_contig_ <dig>  encoded nbs-lrr proteins. additional snps, especially those non-synonymous snps in the above mentioned three rgas, would provide both positional and functional variation sites for further characterization of major gene resistance against c. ribicola. the large amount of snp markers, especially those snps in the candidate genes, may prove useful to study the evolution and adaptation of resistance mechanisms under selection pressure of climate change and wpbr in the native white pine populations across north america. in the future we will conduct sequence comparison and subsequent functional characterization of resistant and susceptible haplotypes of the related nbs-lrr and rlk genes to determine if any of these rgas is responsible for the c. ribicola-resistance phenotype.

identification of snp markers by ld analysis for resistance screening
discovery of a large number of snps along genome using ngs followed by genotyping of a set of samples with available phenotypes has become standard practice for fine genetic mapping of complex traits. in this study, we used a collection of wwp resistant germplasm to investigate genotype-phenotype relationships. ld, which is the non-random co-segregation of alleles at two loci, can result from many factors, including effective population size and structure, recombination rate, genetic drift, mating system, and selection  <cit> . recombination between homologous chromosomes causes ld to decay as the distance between two loci increases during meiosis. in general, ld decay is faster in open-pollinated plants and in more diverse populations of the same species, but rates of ld decay may vary greatly in different genes and genomic regions in the same species  <cit> . thus, information on ld content is a crucial prerequisite for any genome-wide association study to fine-tune both targeted genomic regions and candidate genes.

as monoecious gymnosperms, pinus species show ld decay rates of ~ <dig> to  <dig>  bp  <cit> . due to this pattern of rapid ld decay in conifers, genetic associations revealed by snps are likely to be located in close proximity to causative polymorphisms  <cit> . our previous studies showed an intragenic ld decay to r <dig> estimate of  <dig>  within 600 ~ 700-bp in p. monticola degs  <cit> , suggesting that related candidate genes may have a high resolution for association studies. in the present study, at least one snp marker was found to be tightly associated to cr <dig> with high ld in the tested germplasm across four populations with as many as  <dig> full-sib families . we suggest that these nucleotide variations may be used as selectable markers for breeding wwp with major gene resistance to c. ribicola. other snp markers of the rgas and degs with significant lds  may also be very close to, or within, the gene affecting the resistance trait. to confirm this hypothesis we will conduct a continuous study to determine the extent of inter- and intra-chromosomal ld using wwp genetic mapping populations. association mapping using a genome-wide approach still requires accumulation of sufficient genomic resources in five needle pines.

population structure of wwp resistant germplasm
lack of genetic diversity and ecological challenges  are two causes of population reduction and species extinction. conifer seed orchards are commonly used to produce consistent, abundant, and genetically improved seeds with well-adapted environmental performance. these orchard seed lots are used for reforestation and restoration activities with species like wwp. unfortunately, orchard seed lots are usually composed of undetermined proportions of seeds contributed by many parents through out-crossing and open pollination. furthermore, it is critical that appropriate levels of genetic diversity are maintained to avoid inbreeding and loss of rare alleles by genetic drift in forest seed orchards or seed collections. while elite seed orchards can be developed by pyramiding favorable alleles, favourable alleles may be dispersed in different stands/ancestors. complete pedigree information is thus an essential prerequisite for the selection and deployment of elite genotypes in modern conservation and breeding  <cit> . molecular-based parentage analysis has been used to quantify genetic diversity and to help prevent inbreeding in reforestation stocks  <cit> . maintenance of genetic diversity in reforestation stock of long-lived tree species such as wwp is key to helping ensure the continued presence of this species in forests and forested ecosystems.

sibship reconstruction in our study provided the clearest evidence for seed family structure in a collection of wwp germplasm. accuracy of parentage analysis increases with the number and diversity of genetic loci. popular parentage inference methods  can be applied with confidence in natural populations with highly polymorphic loci  <cit> . snps are powerful for parentage inference and a previous study suggested that 60– <dig> snps may allow accurate pedigree reconstruction in large managed and/or natural populations  <cit> . we took careful consideration of the number and quality of snp markers to increase the accuracy of our parentage assignments. wwp parentage assignment and pedigree reconstruction revealed the occurrence of 35– <dig> full-sib families in the composite seed lot we tested. also, consistent results were obtained by separate sampling in a 1st snp assay using  <dig> snps and in a 2nd assay using  <dig> snps . the wwp breeding germplasm, comprising seed families selected from wild ecosystems, were confirmed to be strongly structured with complex populations. this current comprehensive genetic characterization contributes to the knowledge about levels and distribution of genetic diversity and gains novel insight into genetic subdivision within the available wwp resistance resources. our results clarify knowledge of the genetic constitution of the collected p. monticola germplasm and could allow us to prioritize individuals on the basis of conservation value for minimizing loss of genetic variation in conservation program as well as to develop breeding recommendation with balance between maximizing gene diversity and minimizing inbreeding for tree improvement by identifying the main genitors. genotypic data from our study may efficiently guide further application of this diversity in the long-term management and reforestation of this tree species across western north america.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study represents the first research of candidate gene-based snp discovery using pooled rna-seq approach integrated with bulked segregation analysis in a five-needle pine. we generated novel transcriptome and snp data from shoot-tip tissues of the c. ribicola-resistant and -susceptible wwp germplasm that originated from a composite seed lot. a subset of  <dig> snp loci were verified by high-throughput genotyping and  <dig> % of them were polymorphic. using genotypic data of these snp markers, parentage relationship and genetic diversity were determined in wwp germplasm collection and snp markers were identified for breeding screening of resistance to wpbr across wwp populations. these validated snp resources may open up new avenues for ecological genomics and comparative genetic mapping in five-needle pine species.
