BACKGROUND
the genus vibrio comprises a diverse group of gamma-proteobacteria autochthonous to the marine, estuarine, and freshwater environment. these bacteria play a role in nutrient cycling, degrade hydrocarbons, and can be devastating pathogens for fish, shellfish, and mammals as well as humans  <cit> . from  <dig> to  <dig>  the number of validly described species within the genus increased from  <dig> to more than  <dig>  <cit> . the most notorious, v. cholerae, is the etiological agent of the severe diarrheal disease cholera, endemic in southeast asia for at least  <dig>  years and the cause of seven pandemics since  <dig>  shown to be autochthonous to the aquatic environment globally, more than  <dig> serogroups of v. cholerae have been described. epidemics of cholera are caused by v. cholerae o <dig> and o <dig>  with v. cholerae non-o1/non-o <dig> strains associated with sporadic cholera cases and extraintestinal infections  <cit> . cholera infections have been ascribed to the presence and expression of virulence genes, e.g., ctxa, tcpa, tcpp, and toxt  <cit> , which are also harbored by toxigenic strains of v. mimicus, a phylogenetic near-neighbor of v. cholerae. genomic analyses of v. cholerae and v. mimicus demonstrated significant similarity, suggesting horizontal exchange of virulence factors, such as ctxΦ and vpis- <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . based on results of phylogenetic analyses reported by thompson et al.  <cit> , v. cholerae and v. mimicus should be assigned to separate genera, a taxonomic assignment not yet resolved.

the aims of this study were to describe the genomes of two vibrio strains previously characterized as variant v. cholerae by culture-based and molecular methods  <cit> , and compare them to closely related vibrio genomes. results of this study suggest these two strains represent novel species and demonstrate evidence of horizontal gene transfer with their near-neighbors, v. cholerae and v. mimicus. we present here the genomic characterization of two new vibrio species, vibrio sp. rc <dig>  and vibrio sp. rc <dig> , that share a close phylogenetic and genomic relationship with v. cholerae and v. mimicus, but are distinct species, based on comparative genomics, average nucleotide identity , average amino acid identity , multi-locus sequence analysis , and phylogenetic analysis. also, we present results of a comparative genomic analysis of these two novel species with  <dig> v. cholerae, two v. mimicus and one each of v. vulnificus and v. parahaemolyticus . the new vibrio species are characterized as vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig>  sharing genes and mobile genetic elements with v. cholerae and v. mimicus. these data suggest that vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> may act as reservoirs of mobile genetic elements, including virulence islands, for v. cholerae and v. mimicus, horizontal gene transfer among these bacteria enables colonization of new niches in the environment, as well as conferring virulence in the human host. descriptions of these species and definitions have been provided elsewhere .

RESULTS
strains
the two strains analyzed in this study, vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig>  were isolated from water samples from the chesapeake bay, md in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> were presumptively classified as variant v. cholerae  <cit> , based on similarity to the 16s ribosomal rna of v. cholerae. vibrio sp. rc <dig> appears as yellow v. cholerae-like cells and vibrio sp. rc <dig> appears as green v. mimicus-like cells on tcbs agar. both strains were typeable with v. cholerae antisera, vibrio sp. rc <dig> as serogroup o <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> as serogroup o <dig>  <cit> .

general genome overview
the genomes of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> span  <dig> and  <dig> contigs, respectively, and putatively encode  <dig> and  <dig> orfs totaling  <dig> , <dig> bp and  <dig> , <dig> bp, respectively. vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes  <dig> rnas,  <dig> of which are trnas. vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes  <dig> rnas,  <dig> of which are trnas. the %gc content of each genome is ca. 46%, while the %gc content of v. cholerae strains is 47%. vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes  <dig> hypothetical proteins  and vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes  <dig> hypothetical proteins  determined by subsystem annotation. twenty-four of these hypothetical proteins of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and  <dig> of vibrio sp. rc <dig> showed no homology to any of the sequences in the ncbi database.

both genomes putatively encode two chromosomes, determined by comparing both chromosomes of v. cholerae n <dig> to draft genome sequences of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> using the mummer program  <cit>  . the smaller chromosome of vibrio sp. rc <dig> putatively encodes  <dig> predicted orfs, totaling approximately  <dig> , <dig> bp. by this method,  <dig> orfs were detected in vibrio sp. rc <dig> totaling  <dig>  bp. the smaller size of the second chromosome of vibrio sp. rc <dig> can be attributed to low-quality coverage of this genome or uncaptured gaps. both putative small chromosomes of the two species encode a superintegron region homologous to that of v. cholerae. the superintegron region of vibrio sp. rc <dig> is ca.  <dig>  kb, putatively encodes  <dig> orfs,  <dig>  of which are hypothetical proteins and the superintegron region of vibrio sp. rc <dig> is ca.  <dig>  kb, putatively encodes  <dig> orfs, only  <dig>  of which are hypothetical proteins. interestingly, the superintegron of vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes several membrane bound proteins suggesting their role in the interaction with the extracellular environment.

genome comparisons
the genomes of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> were compared with each other and to  <dig> v. cholerae, two v. mimicus, one v. vulnificus and one v. parahaemolyticus genome sequences by pairwise reciprocal blast analysis. vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> share  <dig> non-duplicated orfs  and  <dig> non-duplicated orfs  with  <dig> v. cholerae strains. chun et al.  <cit>  determined that the current v. cholerae core contains  <dig> orfs, indicating a dramatic difference in number of core genes between vibrio sp. rc341/rc <dig> and v. cholerae core genomes. vibrio sp. rc <dig> shares  <dig> orfs with v. cholerae n <dig> , and vibrio sp. rc <dig> shares  <dig> orfs with v. cholerae n <dig>  . vibrio sp. rc <dig> shares  <dig> orfs with v. mimicus mb- <dig> , and vibrio sp. rc <dig> shares  <dig> orfs with v. mimicus mb- <dig>  . vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> share  <dig> orfs with each other  .

to determine average nucleotide identity  and average amino acid identity  between each genome, the average pairwise similarity between orfs conserved between the compared genomes was calculated, following methods of konstantinidis and tiedje  <cit>  and konstantinidis et al.  <cit> . in this approach, two genomes with an ani >95% and aai >96% belong to the same species, while those with ani and aai below these thresholds, comprise separate species  <cit> . the ani and aai between vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> was  <dig> and 92%, respectively . the anis between vibrio sp. rc <dig> and individual v. cholerae ranged between  <dig> and 86%, while the ani between vibrio sp. rc <dig> and v. cholerae ranged between  <dig> and 86% . the aais between vibrio sp. rc <dig> and individual v. cholerae genomes and vibrio sp. rc <dig> and v. cholerae were 92% in all comparisons . the anis between vibrio sp. rc <dig> and v. mimicus mb- <dig> and vm <dig> were 88% and 87%, respectively, and 86% for vibrio sp. rc <dig> and both v. mimicus genomes . the aai between vibrio sp. rc <dig> and v. mimicus strains mb- <dig> and vm <dig> was 92% in both comparisons, while the aai between vibrio sp. rc <dig> and both v. mimicus strains was 93% .

the v. cholerae genomes had ani >95% and aai >96% and both v. mimicus strains a 98% ani and aai. the ani for all v. cholerae and both v. mimicus strains was 86%. based on these data, it is concluded that vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> are, indeed, separate species, genetically distinct from v. mimicus and v. cholerae and from each other. strains of interspecies comparisons shared <95% ani and <96% aai with members of other species included in this study, the threshold for species demarcation  <cit> , as applied to vibrio, burkholderia, escherichia, salmonella, and shewanella spp.  <cit> . when vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> were compared with the more distantly related v. vulnificus and v. parahaemolyticus, vibrio sp. rc <dig> showed  <dig> and 72% ani and  <dig> and 73% aai, respectively and vibrio sp. rc <dig>  <dig> and 72% ani and  <dig> and 73% aai with v. vulnificus and v. parahaemolyticus, respectively . furthermore, comparative analysis of the rpob sequence demonstrates that vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> have < <dig> % sequence identity with the rpob sequences of all v. cholerae and v. mimicus strains included in this study. in a comparative dna-dna hybridization and ani analysis, adékambi et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that rpob < <dig> % correlated with dna-dna hybridization <70% and ani <95%, both being interpreted as demarcation thresholds for bacteria. all v. cholerae strains included in this study showed > <dig> % rpob sequence similarity with v. cholerae n <dig> . based on a standard mlsa for the vibrionaceae  <cit> , vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> both have <95% pair-wise similarity with v. cholerae, v. mimicus, v. vulnificus, and v. parahaemolyticus strains. all v. cholerae strains and both v. mimicus strains used in this analysis demonstrated >95% similarity between concatenated genes of like-species . karlin's dissimilarity signatures were also calculated between these two genomes and the vibrio genomes used in this study. vibrio sp. rc <dig> shared > <dig> dissimilarity with all v. cholerae , v. vulnificus , and v. parahaemolyticus  genomes, and >  <dig> with both v. mimicus strains. vibrio sp. rc <dig> shared > <dig> dissimilarity for all v. cholerae  except v. cholerae b <dig>  and tma <dig> . vibrio sp. rc <dig> shared > <dig> genome signature dissimilarity with v. parahaemolyticus , v. vulnificus , and both v. mimicus  genomes. vibrio sp rc <dig> and rc <dig> shared a genomic dissimilarity of  <dig>  with each other. taken together these data indicate that vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> are new species with a high genomic relatedness to v. cholerae and v. mimicus.

evolution of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> lineages
the phylogenies of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> were inferred by constructing a supertree, using a  <dig>  bp homologous alignment of v. cholerae, v. mimicus, and the new species . based on the supertree analysis vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> are deeply rooted in ancestral nodes, suggesting ancient evolution of the two species. results of this phylogenetic analysis suggest the vibrio sp. rc <dig> lineage evolved from a progenitor of the v. cholerae and v. mimicus lineages , a finding supported by strong bootstrap support and further evidenced by the evolutionary distance of v. cholerae and v. mimicus from vibrio sp. rc <dig> . the two v. mimicus strains are interspersed among v. cholerae, with respect to evolutionary distance, suggesting that evolutionary distances of v. cholerae and v. mimicus are equidistant from vibrio sp. rc <dig> .

the phylogeny of vibrio sp. rc <dig> suggests it evolved from an ancestral member of the v. mimicus lineage after the lineage evolved from a progenitor of v. mimicus/v. cholerae . these iterations are supported by strong bootstrap support calculations. a close evolutionary relationship for vibrio sp. rc <dig> and v. mimicus is also supported by shorter evolutionary distances between the vibrio sp. rc <dig> and v. mimicus strains . the evolutionary distance of all genomes used in this study from v. cholerae bx  <dig>  a putative progeny of the progenitor of the 7th pandemic clade  <cit> , is shown in additional file  <dig> 

virulence factors
both vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> genomes encode several virulence factors found in toxigenic and non-toxigenic v. cholerae and v. mimicus. these include the toxr/toxs virulence regulators, multiple hemolysins and lipases, vsp-i and ii, and a type  <dig> secretion system. both vsp islands are also present in pathogenic strains of the seventh pandemic clade  <cit> . although neither genome encodes ctxΦ phage, the major virulence factor encoding the cholera toxin  that is responsible for the profuse secretory diarrhea caused by toxigenic v. cholerae and v. mimicus, both genomes do have homologous sequences of the chromosomal attachment site for this phage. although these genomes do not encode tcpa, the outer membrane protein that ctxΦ attaches to during its infection cycle and toxt, involved in ctxΦ replication and activation, they do encode several other mechanisms necessary for the complete ctxΦ life cycle and both ct production and translocation, including tolqra, inner membrane proteins involved in ctxΦ attachment to the cell, xercd tyrosine recombinases, which catalyze recombination between ctxΦ and the host genome, lexa, involved in ctxΦ expression, and espd, involved in the secretion of the ctxΦ virion and ct translocation into the extracellular environment.

neither vibrio sp. rc <dig> nor vibrio sp. rc <dig> encode vpi- <dig> or vpi- <dig>  but vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes one copy of both vsp-i  and vsp-ii  and vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes one copy of vsp-i . however, neither of these strains encodes complete vsp islands, but rather variants of canonical vsp islands. incomplete vsp islands have been frequently found in environmental v. cholerae and v. mimicus isolates  <cit>  .

the toxr/toxs virulence regulators, hemolysins, lipases, and type  <dig> secretion system are present in all pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of v. cholerae and both vsp islands are present in pathogenic strains of the seventh pandemic. presence of these virulence factors in v. cholerae genomes sequenced to date, as well as their divergence consistent with the conserved core of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig>  suggests that they comprise a portion of the backbone of many vibrio species. their widespread occurrence suggests the ability of all vibrios to be potential pathogens, but more likely, these factors have an important role in their ecology.

natural competence
analysis of the  <dig> v. cholerae genomes that have been sequenced revealed the presence of type iv pili genes, involved in natural transformation of haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp. and other competent bacteria  <cit> . vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> also encode this system. moreover, both species encode all  <dig> orfs described by meibom et al.  <cit>  that comprise the chitin utilization program for induction of natural competence. the presence of these systems in the two new species and in v. cholerae indicates natural competence is widely employed by vibrios to incorporate novel dna into their genomes and, thereby, enhance both adaption to new environments and in evolution. furthermore, the well-established association of these bacteria with chitinous organisms and with high densities in biofilms  <cit>  supports the notion that natural competence and horizontal gene transfer are both highly expressed and common in vibrios.

genomic islands and integration loci for exogenous dna
analysis of  <dig> complete and draft v. cholerae genomes by chun et al.  <cit>  showed  <dig> putative genomic islands to be present. by pairwise reciprocal comparison, the genomes of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> are concluded to encode several of these genomic islands, as well as many of the insertion loci of v. cholerae genomic islands  <cit> , indicating extensive horizontal transfer of genomic islands. v. cholerae insertion loci are not specific to individual genomic islands, but can act as integration sites for a variety of islands  <cit> . vibrio sp. rc <dig> contains  <dig> putative gi insertion loci and vibrio sp. rc <dig> contains  <dig> that are homologous to those found in v. cholerae. in addition to having highly similar attachment sequences and insertion loci, as found in v. cholerae, most of the homologous trna sequences between vibrio sp. rc <dig>  vibrio sp. rc <dig>  and v. cholerae are identical. however, three glutamine-trna and one aspartate-trna sequence of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and four glutamine-trna and four aspartate-trna sequences of vibrio sp. rc <dig> show between  <dig> and 97% similarity with homologous v. cholerae trna sequences. these sites serve as integration loci for many pathogenicity islands. interestingly, all trna-ser, the loci most commonly targeted by island encoded integrases of mobile elements in v. cholerae  <cit> , were 100% similar between all strains. this high similarity of platforms serving to insert exogenous dna suggests that the same or highly similar genomic islands are readily shared. sequences that are characteristic of gis and islets with homologous v. cholerae insertion loci and putative function and annotations are described in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 


vibrio sp. rc <dig> also encodes five sequences with homology to the ctxΦ attachment site, with four of them being tandemly arranged on the putative large chromosome . at these loci are four elements with high similarity  to the rs1Φ phage-like elements  of v. cholerae sce <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> to 100% nucleotide identity to the rs1Φ-like elements in v. cholerae tma <dig>  tm11079- <dig>  vl <dig>  and 623- <dig>  reported by chun et al.  <cit>  to be gi- <dig> . rs1Φ is a satellite phage related to ctxΦ and assists in integration and replication of the ctxΦ  <cit> . however, these v. cholerae strains were either ctxΦ-negative or encode a ctxΦ on the other chromosome, while encoding sequences with high similarity to rsta, and rstb of rs1Φ, rs1-type sequences  <cit> . immediately upstream of the rsta1-like sequence is an hypothetical protein and immediately downstream of this rstb1-like sequence is an hypothetical protein with 52% identity with that of colwellia psychrerythraea 34h, and a sequence with 99% similarity to an end-repeat  region and an intergenic region  of ctxΦ . this region may represent a novel phage containing orfs with similarity to the rs1Φ satellite phage and er and ig- <dig> regions with high similarity to ctxΦ. absence of an integrase in this region suggests it may integrate into the genome via xercd tyrosine recombinases, as does ctxΦ. all putative genomic islands shared by v. cholerae and vibrio sp. rc <dig> are listed in additional file  <dig> 

vibrio sp. rc <dig> putatively encodes  <dig> sequences that are characteristic of genomic islands and islets that are also found in v. cholerae . vsp-i and -ii and gis- <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>  and islets- <dig> to  <dig> are located on the large chromosome, while gi- <dig> and  <dig> are located on the small chromosome . these gis were described by chun et al.  <cit>  and two are single copies of vsp-i  and vsp-ii . neither of the vsp islands was present in their entirety, compared to 7th pandemic v. cholerae strains. similar to the vsp-i variant in vibrio sp. rc <dig>  the variant in vibrio sp. rc <dig> has a deletion of vc <dig>  also, orfs vcj_ <dig> to vcj_ <dig> are annotated as phage integrase, transposase, and phage integrase, respectively. the homologous orfs of this vsp-i variant have a 92% sequence similarity to the canonical vsp-i island. interestingly, vsp-ii variant of vibrio sp. rc <dig> contains a  <dig> kb putative phage encoding a type  <dig> restriction modification system, has a %gc of ca. 38%, and is located at the homologous insertion locus of gi- <dig> in v. cholerae  . this phage shares significant similarity with v. vulnificus yj <dig> phage . several variants of vsp-ii are encoded in multiple strains of v. cholerae . however, the variant encoded in vibrio sp. rc <dig> is, to date, unique.

interestingly, vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes v. cholerae gi- <dig>  a ca.  <dig> bp region,  similar to rs1Φ-like phage in vibrio sp. rc <dig>  v. cholerae strains vl <dig>  sce <dig>  tma <dig>  tm11079- <dig>  and 623- <dig>  showing  <dig> to 96% nucleotide sequence similarity across  <dig> to 79% of the phage . this region in vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes only the rsta <dig> and rstb <dig> and the 3' hypothetical protein flanked by ctxΦ-like end repeats and an intergenic region, inserted at the homologous ctxΦ attachment site on chromosome i . analysis of this and similar phages inserting at this locus suggests an extremely high diversity of vibriophages in both structure and sequence in the environment. putative genomic islands shared by v. cholerae and vibrio sp. rc <dig> are listed in additional file  <dig> 

horizontal gene transfer of genomic islands
homologous genomic islands typically showed higher ani between strains than the conserved backbone regions of these genomes, an indication of recent transfer of these islands among the same and different species. all gis shared by vibrio sp. rc <dig> and v. cholerae strains were  <dig> to 100% ani%, with the exception of two gis with 77%  and 82%  ani . all gis among vibrio sp. rc <dig> and v. cholerae had  <dig> to 99% ani, excluding three gis with  <dig> to 82% , and two with and 85%  .

phylogenetic analysis using homologous orfs of the genomic islands yielded evidence of recent lateral transfer of vsp-i, and gis- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> among v. cholerae and vibrio sp. rc <dig>  in all cases, phylogenies inferred by the orfs were incongruent with species phylogeny, suggesting the elements were transferred after the species diverged . using the same methods, we found evidence of recent lateral transfer of vsp-i, gi- <dig>  and islet- <dig>  between v. cholerae and vibrio sp. rc <dig>  in all cases, phylogenies inferred by the orfs were incongruent with species phylogeny . our data suggests that v. cholerae vl <dig>  received a vsp-i similar to that of vibrio sp. rc <dig> and vibrio sp. rc <dig> via horizontal gene transfer. we also found evidence of horizontal transfer of v. cholerae gi- <dig> from v. cholerae to vibrio sp. rc <dig>  as well as vibrio sp. rc <dig> islet- <dig> and v. cholerae gi- <dig> from vibrio sp. rc <dig> to v. cholerae strains.

vsp-ii, islets- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and gis- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  all present in at least one v. cholerae genome and in vibrio sp. rc <dig>  showed no evidence of horizontal gene transfer. most likely there are many undescribed variants of these elements, in both structure and nucleotide sequence, yet to be found in the natural environment, with certain variants more frequently transferred among strains of the same species. coevolution of the island and host genome over time no doubt occurs. in any case, based on the data reported here v. cholerae is not alone in propagating these elements. they surely cycle among different but closely related species in the environment.

unique genomic islands
vibrio sp. rc <dig> putatively encodes five unique genomic islands and islets not yet reported for v. cholerae . vibrio sp. rc <dig> gi- <dig> and islet- <dig> encode phage-like elements. interestingly, islet- <dig> is annotated as probable coat protein a precursor, with similarity to bacteriophage f <dig> orf <dig> of v. campbellii and zona occludens toxin , with high similarity to v. parahaemolyticus and v. harveyi zot . this phage-like element is inserted at the homologous locus for v. cholerae o <dig> classical ctxΦ insertion . vibrio sp. rc <dig> gi- <dig> encodes sequences homologous to the tn <dig> transposition tnsabcde, a transposon known to integrate into phylogenetically diverse organisms and form genomic islands  <cit> . vibrio sp. rc <dig> gis- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and islets- <dig> through  <dig> all share homologous insertion loci with previously described v. cholerae gis .

vibrio sp. rc <dig> encodes six putative unique genomic islands not reported before . vibrio sp. rc <dig> gis- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> all encode phage-like/related elements. vibrio sp. rc <dig> gi- <dig> and  <dig> both encode several transposases and a sequence with homology to an insertion-like sequence in the v. parahaemolyticus insertion sequence element isv-3l. vibrio sp. rc <dig> gi- <dig> , ca.  <dig> bp region of hypothetical proteins and transposases, is inserted at the homologous locus for v. cholerae o <dig> classical ctxΦ, a locus shown to harbor a variety of gis and phages  <cit>  .

CONCLUSIONS
the genomes of two new vibrio species previously characterized as variant v. cholerae, have been sequenced and their sequences used to describe their interesting and important features. the genomes of both species reveal significant nucleotide sequence divergence  from each other and from v. cholerae and v. mimicus genomes, supporting the conclusion that both represent unique species not described before. moreover, genes conserved among v. cholerae, v. mimicus, and the two new species varied sufficiently to suggest ancient speciation via genetic drift of the ancestral core genomic backbone. furthermore, results of our analyses suggest vibrio sp. rc <dig> to have evolved from a progenitor of v. cholerae and v. mimicus, whereas vibrio sp. rc <dig> is concluded to have evolved from an early v. mimicus clade. although the ani of all genomes analyzed in this study demonstrates divergence, putative genomic islands were found to cross species boundaries, often at an higher ani than the conserved backbone. these data, coupled with phylogenetic analyses, point to lateral transfer of the islands and phages among v. cholerae, v. mimicus, vibrio sp. rc <dig>  and vibrio sp. rc <dig> in the natural environment. furthermore, homologous gi insertion loci were present in both new species and in the case of v. cholerae, these insertion loci were not gi-specific. the pool of dna laterally transferred between and among members of the vibrionaceae strongly suggests that near-neighbors of v. cholerae act as reservoirs of transferable genetic elements and virulence in the environment and that v. cholerae is not alone in propagating these elements therein. results of this study also demonstrate a widespread allelic variation in these elements and evidence of evolution of mobile genetic elements, including pathogenicity islands, through a multistep mosaic recombination with other elements, including phage. the ability of vibrios to incorporate exogenous dna at several loci that encode a large combination of gis, thereby, allows optimization of the genome for success in a specific niche or wider ecology in the natural environment.
