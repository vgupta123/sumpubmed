BACKGROUND
escherichia coli is a versatile bacterial species that exists as a commensal in the lower gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals as well as a pathogen that causes a variety of diseases  <cit> . unlike commensal e. coli, pathogenic e. coli harbor various virulence genes which provide the basis for categorizing them into different pathovars with each pathovar having the ability to establish a distinct infection  <cit> . these virulence traits include adhesins, iron acquisition systems, toxins, invasins, and serum resistant components of the cell wall that are encoded by the bacterial chromosome and plasmids .

a distinct pathotype of extra-intestinal pathogenic e. coli  known as neonatal meningitis-causing e. coli  have the ability to survive in blood and invade meninges of infants to cause meningitis  <cit> . escherichia coli associated neonatal meningitis is one of the most common infections that accounts for high mortality and morbidity rates  during the neonatal period  <cit> . although distinct sets of virulence traits have been identified in diarrheagenic e. coli and other expec pathovars, distinct virulence traits have not been identified to define the nmec pathotype  <cit> . several studies have attempted to characterize nmec strains using phenotypic and genotyping methods, such as serotyping, multi-locus sequence typing , phylogrouping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , antibiotic resistance gene profiling, and virulence genotyping . a recent study showed that nmec strains are diverse in their virulence gene repertoire and the genes that are uniquely associated with nmec have yet to be identified  <cit> . although nmec have to breach the blood brain barrier  to reach and infect the meninges, the studies that used various genotypic and phenotypic traits to characterize nmec have not compared the ability of different nmec strains to invade the bbb using a model comparable to human brain microvascular endothelial cells. here, we attempted to determine the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of nmec including their ability to invade the bbb and identify a set of virulence genes that were relatively common in nmec as compared to fecal e. coli from healthy humans .

RESULTS
phylogenetic typing of nmec and hfec
all four major phylogenetic lineages  were represented by both nmec and hfec although the distribution of each lineage among the isolates belonging to two sources   was different. phylogroup b <dig> was overly represented in nmec  as compared to hfec   whereas the phylogroups a and b <dig> were more common in hfec  than in nmec  . no statistical difference was observed for the distribution of group d between nmec and hfec .table  <dig> distribution of different phylogroups between neonatal meningitis e. coli  and fecal e. coli from healthy individuals . a p < <dig>  reflects a statistical significance




serotyping
serotyping of nmec and hfec isolates  showed that  <dig> different o serogroups were present in nmec while  <dig> different o groups were observed in hfec. three isolates of nmec and six isolates of hfec were not typeable by the o antisera used in the study. another four nmec and two hfec demonstrated multiple o antigen types. the most common o types present in nmec were o <dig> , o <dig> , and o <dig>  whereas o <dig>  and o <dig>  were more common in hfec than the other o types. similarly, among nmec strains tested, ten different h types were observed, h <dig> being the most prevalent . hfec strains belonged to  <dig> different h types with nine isolates demonstrating an h- negative phenotype.fig.  <dig> characteristics of neonatal meningitis e. coli  and fecal e. coli from healthy individuals  used in the study

serum resistance
no statistically significant difference in the percentages of serum resistant isolates between nmec and hfec  was observed .

virulence genotyping
the number of virulence traits present in nmec was higher  than in hfec  revealing a considerable variation between the virulence gene profiles of e. coli from two different sources . for example, of the  <dig> vfs examined in the study, the occurrence of  <dig> genes was significantly higher  in nmec than in hfec . notably, k <dig> capsular type, sfa/foc, sat, hlya/d, iuta, papg iii, and afa genes were only represented in nmec populations, although their occurrence among nmec isolates was low except for the k <dig> capsular type. virulence traits kpsii, sita, neuc, iucc, and vat were more commonly associated with nmec than with hfec . similar to the observations made by previous studies, some virulence genes that were implicated in the penetration of bbb, such as fimh, npl, and ibeb were equally present in both nmec and hfec strains  <cit> . on the other hand, some virulence genes, such as cnf <dig> and traj, that were considered to be required for nmec pathogenesis, were possessed only by a minority of nmec . however, these genes were more frequently observed in nmec than in hfec .fig.  <dig> heat map demostrating the distribution of virulence genes in nmec and hfec. red represents the presence and black represents the absence of a virulence gene; a, virulence genes equally present in both nmec and hfec; b, virulence genes are more prevalent and overly represented in nmec than in hfec; c, virulence genes are less prevalent in both nmec and hfec

pfge
out of the nmec and hfec isolates tested, only  <dig> were typeable by pfge. the hfec strain  <dig> and two nmec isolates  were nontypeable with xbai restriction digestion. the typeable isolates demonstrated  <dig> distinct pfge fingerprint patterns or pulsotypes . of the  <dig> pulsotypes,  <dig> were unique and each pattern was present only in one isolate. the other seven pulsotypes were present in two or more isolates of e. coli. not a single pulsotype was shared between nmec and hfec.

biofilm assay
the ability to form biofilms on a microtitre plate by nmec and hfec were assessed using m <dig> minimal medium supplemented with niacin and luria bertani  broth . about 53 % of nmec strains cultured in m <dig> minimal medium were able to form biofilms on microtitre plates whereas only  <dig>  % of hfec possessed this phenotype . however, this difference was not statistically significant . a higher percentage of nmec  formed biofilms when they were cultured in lb broth than in the m <dig> medium  but the ability to form biofilms by hefc remained the same regardless of the medium used.

antibiotic susceptibility testing and multilocus sequence typing 
as depicted in table  <dig>  a majority of nmec and hfec were susceptible to most of the antimicrobials tested in the study. all isolates tested were susceptible to gentamicin, imipenam, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin. only five isolates of nmec and three isolates of hfec were resistant to all four third generation cephalosporins . the minimal inhibitory concentration  values for these eight isolates were increased by ≥ <dig> folds when cefotaxime and ceftazidine were used in combination with clavulanic acid as compared to the mic values for cefotaxime and ceftazidine alone confirming that these isolates possessed the esbl resistance phenotype according to the clinical laboratory standards institute  guidelines. to further characterize e. coli demonstrating an esbl phenotype, they were subjected to mlst. the eight isolates with an esbl phenotype fell into eight different sequence types  demonstrating a clonal diversity among the isolates .table  <dig> antibiotic susceptibility profiles of nmec and hfec. number of isolates  in nmec and hfec were categorized as sensitive , intermediate  or resistant  according to clsi standards

discussion
pathogenic e. coli consist of diarrheagenic e. coli causing intestinal disease and expec causing extraintestinal diseases in humans and animals  <cit> . both diarrheagenic e. coli and expec are grouped into many pathotypes or pathovars depending on the clinical outcome of the disease and virulence properties of e. coli involved  <cit> . of these two major groups of pathogenic e. coli, expec possess the ability to colonize and infect extraintestinal sites of the host by means of horizontally acquired genetic determinants or virulence genes  <cit> . several studies have been conducted to identify the unique virulence traits of expec, such as uropathogenic e. coli, nmec, and avian pathogenic e. coli to understand the genetic makeup and pathogenic potential of different expec pathovars . however, these studies indicate that substantial genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity exist within each pathotype, and a pathotype cannot be defined merely based on the presence of a defined set of virulence genes or characteristics. nevertheless, some virulence attributes are shared among different pathotypes making it difficult to delineate expec pathotypes  <cit> . here, we comparatively analyzed genotypic and phenotypic traits of nmec and hfec to identify the characteristics that would assist in defining the nmec pathotype.

in this study, we examined a collection of nmec for the most prevalent  and overly represented virulence traits found in nmec as compared to hfec  for defining the nmec pathotype. based on these criteria, we have identified six genes, namely, kpsii, k <dig>  neuc, iucc, sita, and vat, which were predominantly associated with nmec pathotype. among these, some virulence traits such as, kpsii, sita, and vat are considered as typical traits of nmec  <cit> . none of the hfec isolates surveyed possessed all six genes, whereas 40 % of nmec isolates harbored all six genes suggesting that these genes might be used to predict the nmec pathotype . as depicted in fig.  <dig>  a majority of nmec possessed the k <dig> capsular type . all k1+ nmec were positive for sita together with vat and/or iucc. except three isolates, all other k1+ nmec harbored the neuc gene as well. taken together, these results suggest that a typical nmec might be described as k1+ and sita+ and having at least two of the other three genes; vat, neuc and iucc. using this criterion, it was possible to designate 74 % of nmec used in this study as typical nmec whereas none of the hfec satisfied these benchmarks. however, typing of a larger collection of nmec isolates representing different geographical regions might be required to confirm these observations.fig.  <dig> distributin of k <dig>  sita, vat, neuc, and iucc genes among nmec strains . red, positive for a gene; grey, negative for a gene. encircled area indicates the isolates used to define a typical nmec



a pcr-based phylogrouping has been established to determine the clonality within e. coli pathotypes  <cit> . previous studies have identified group b <dig> as the most common phylogroup of expec suggesting that phylogrouping may be used as a rapid typing method to identify potential expec  <cit> . in the present study, we observed that  <dig>  % of nmec fell into b <dig> phylogroup as compared to  <dig>  % of hfec tested in the study. phylogroups a and b <dig> were more commonly associated with hfec than with nmec. the virulence gene profiles of nmec strains belonging to each phylogroup lineage exhibited a higher prevalence of virulence genes as compared to hfec strains belonging to the corresponding lineage . taken together, our observations emphasize that phylogrouping alone is not suitable for predicting potential nmec.table  <dig> number of virulence traits present in neonatal meningitis e. coli  and fecal e. coli  belonging to different phylogroups


adenotes a statistically significant difference between nmec and hfec



pulsotyping and serotyping have been used in various studies to identify pathogenic clones and to distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of many bacterial species  <cit> . in our study, we observed a considerable heterogeneity among both nmec and hfec. as depicted in table  <dig>  despite this diversity, many nmec strains belonged to o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> serogroups and h <dig> flagellar antigen type. similar to our observation, previous studies have also noted that the h <dig> antigen is present in major virulent clones of expec pathotypes making it a potential target for future diagnostic and therapeutic interventions  <cit> . two subtypes of h <dig> antigen have been identified for enterohemorrhagic e. coli  based on the flicc  allelic polymorphism, a technique which possibly can be used to type ehec  <cit> . for example, h7a and h7c subtypes have been identified in e. coli o157: h <dig> irrespective of their geographical origin and genetic variation observed with other molecular typing methods  <cit> . however, whether this genetic polymorphism of h7 does or does not exist in expec pathotypes is currently unknown. future studies focused on h <dig> allelic polymorphism of expec may provide useful information to develop a novel subtyping technique to distinguish different expec pathovars. the heterogeneity observed with pfge was even greater than serotyping indicating that pfge is not useful in distinguishing nmec strains from hfec.

ability to form biofilms in different environmental conditions facilitates bacterial survival on abiotic surfaces and their resistance to antimicrobials and antiseptics  <cit> . given that biofilm formation is reported to assist in bacterial survival, colonization, and protection from host immune responses and antimicrobial agents, the ability to produce biofilms may play an important role in nmec virulence . therefore, we compared the capacity for biofilm formation by nmec and hfec. there was no significant difference in the ability of biofilm formation between nmec and hfec isolates when they were grown in m <dig> medium. however, when lb broth was used as the medium, nmec demonstrated approximately 39 % increase in their ability to form biofilms. in consistent with our observations, previous studies have demonstrated that growth medium has an effect on biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria  <cit>  . jackson et al. noted that central carbon flux has a regulatory effect on the formation of biofilms  <cit> . in particular, readily available glucose has a negative regulatory effect on biofilm formation suggesting that the ability to form biofilms is a survival strategy by bacteria when the source of carbon is limited or complex  <cit> . the m <dig> medium contained 2 % glucose which is a readily available carbon source whereas in lb broth catabolizable amino acids are the source carbon source for bacterial growth. increase in biofilm formation by nmec in lb broth as compared to m9 medium might be due to readily available glucose in m9 medium suggesting that the source of carbon has an effect on biofilm formation by nmec but not by hfec.

beta-lactam antibiotics are one of the major treatment options available for controlling meningitis in infant patients  <cit> . we evaluated the antibiotic sensitivity profiles of nmec and hfec along with esbl resistance profiles. although the majority of strains were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested, eight isolates showed an esbl-resistance phenotype. interestingly, three of the esbl-resistant isolates were fecal commensal isolates implying fecal flora as a source for the emergence of esbl-resistance. previous studies have indicated an association between esbl types and mlst types  <cit> . the esbl-positive e. coli identified in this study fell into st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig> mlst types, which are known to contain e. coli possessing certain esbl types. however, none of the esbl-positive e. coli detected here did belong to st <dig>  a major mlst type associated with esbl-positive e. coli  <cit> . the esbl genes are commonly located on mobilizable elements  and esbl genes are distributed among commensal microflora of humans and animals  <cit> . although a positive correlation between the presence of esbl-positive hfec and esbl-positive upec has been observed by many investigators, there is no evidence to suggest an association between the presence of esbl-producing bacteria in vaginal or fecal flora of pregnant women and corresponding esbl-producing bacterial infections in neonates  <cit> . nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that the risk factors, such as premature delivery, premature membrane rupture, and low birth weight which are known to predispose infants to e. coli meningitis were correlated with the colonization of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in the infant gut  <cit> .

genetic heterogeneity of nmec pathotype is one of the major constraints posing today to understand the pathogenesis of neonatal meningitis  <cit> . concordance with these previous studies, we have also observed marked heterogeneity in the virulence gene profiles of nmec. although nmec possessed more virulence genes than hfec, some of the virulence genes , which have previously been implicated in nmec pathogenesis were present only in <50 % of nmec examined  . the virulence traits, such as fimh, ompa, and nlp <dig> that are considered to be essential for nmec survival in blood and the penetration of bbb were prevalent in both nmec and hfec suggesting these genes do not define the nmec pathotype . the nmec and hfec strains that did not harbor these “essential” virulence genes were still able to invade hcmec/d <dig>  these data indicate that nmec pathogenicity is poorly understood and highlight the need for future research directed at mining novel virulence traits that are truly involved in the penetration of bbb.

in the present study, nmec strains harbored genes that encode iron acquisition systems  and hemolysins , which were more frequently present in nmec than in hfec. in addition to providing a source of iron for bacterial growth through cell lysis, bacterial hemolysins are known to play some other mechanistic roles as well  <cit> . for example, sublytic amounts of e. coli hemolysin have been shown to increase the permeability of endothelial cell monolayers in a time- and dose-dependent manner in cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells  <cit>  . in the same study, a low dose of hemolysin was found to induce a toxin-mediated loss of endothelial barrier function. however, there is no scientific evidence to support the involvement of hemolysins of nmec in increasing the permeability of bbb thereby aiding the disease pathogenesis.

in this study, an in vitro invasion assay was conducted to correlate the virulence traits of each isolate of e. coli with its ability to penetrate the bbb. as expected, nmec strains which carried more virulence genes than hfec were also more invasive in hcmec/d <dig> cells than hfec . interestingly, ten isolates of hfec which demonstrated a noninvasive phenotype with in vitro cell invasion assay were negative for k <dig> capsular type, ibea, traj, and sfa/foc but were positive for fimh, ibeb, and nlpl indicating that ibea, traj, and sfa/foc may be important in nmec pathogenesis even though their occurrence in nmec was less than some other virulence genes. except these ten noninvasive isolates, all other hfec were able to invade the bbb barrier in vitro suggesting fecal commensal e. coli as a potential source of nmec. it is known that a high level of bacteremia is a prerequisite for the attachment and invasion of bbb by nmec  <cit> . the present study also demonstrated that nmec and hfec were equally able to survive in human serum, supporting the speculation that commensal e. coli in the mother’s gut could be a source for nmec in the baby. perhaps serum resistance of nmec may not be as important as previously thought because neonatal serum is deficient in many complement factors. it would be worthy to compare the survival potential of nmec in serum collected from healthy adults and neonates. further investigations on hfec strains exhibiting invasive properties using animal models of meningitis may be needed to confirm that hfec indeed have the potential to cause neonatal meningitis.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study results indicate that regardless of the genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity observed among nmec strains, some genotypic characteristics can still be used to distinguish nmec from commensal e. coli.
