BACKGROUND
eutherians and marsupials  diverged between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and both develop a placenta to support embryonic growth and development. mammalian placental structures arise from the union of either yolk sac or allantois with the chorion but many mammals possess both kinds placentation  <cit> . the majority of marsupials, however, rely exclusively on a chorio-vitelline or yolk sac placenta which consists of two structurally distinct regions. the avascular, bilaminar yolk sac  is presumed to be the primary site of nutrient exchange between mother and young while the vascular, trilaminar yolk sac  acts as the primary route for gas exchange  <cit> .

genomic imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon in which a single allele of a gene is active from only one parental chromosome has, amongst mammals, so far only been found in therians  <cit> . almost all imprinted genes identified affect growth or are embryonic lethal when mutated. the parental conflict hypothesis is the most widely accepted of many hypotheses explaining imprinting and suggests that it evolved as a consequence of divergent selection on parental genes controlling maternal nutrient transfer in utero  <cit> . since the placenta mediates the transfer of nutrients between mother and young, it is an important site for the expression of imprinted genes. indeed, several hypotheses suggest that placentation and genomic imprinting may have co-evolved  <cit> .

although many imprinted genes fit the predictions of the conflict hypothesis, its applicability to marsupials and, therefore, its broader relevance has not been investigated. insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  gene is paternally expressed in the mouse  <cit>  and in at least two marsupials, the south american grey short-tailed opossum   <cit>  and the australian tammar wallaby , in which it is paternally expressed in both the fetus and placenta  <cit> . another three eutherian imprinted genes  are also imprinted in the tammar  <cit>  and in the north american opossum, didelphis virginiana  <cit> . however, the expression, protein localisation, and function of igf <dig>  or any imprinted gene, have not been described in the marsupial yolk sac placenta.

igf <dig> promotes cellular hypertrophy, cell survival, and hyperplasia  <cit>  and is highly conserved in vertebrates  <cit> . in mammals, the availability and action of igf <dig> is mediated by a family of six binding proteins  and three receptors , many of which are expressed in placental and uterine tissues  <cit> . most of the metabolic and mitogenic effects of igf <dig> are mediated through the igf1r  <cit> . the primary role of igf2r during eutherian development is to limit the availability of igf <dig> by its internalisation and lysosomal degradation  <cit> .

igf <dig> can have endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine actions, with the latter two particularly important for fetal development  <cit> . igf2-knockout mice demonstrate its necessity for chorioallantoic placentation  <cit> . igf <dig> has been implicated in several aspects of placental development, including blood vessel formation  <cit> , trophoblast invasion  <cit> , nutrient transfer  <cit> , and differentiation  <cit> . igf <dig> also contributes to the transcriptional regulation of several genes including vegf  and this interaction may be important for placental development  <cit> . igf <dig> mutations are associated with gestational diseases such as pre-eclampsia in which angiogenesis is disrupted  <cit> , possibly as a result of increased expression of vegf.

if igf <dig> imprinting evolved as a consequence of its functional importance in therian placentation then it should, in addition to being imprinted in marsupials, also function in the marsupial placenta. the present study describes the temporal expression of igf <dig> mrna and the location of igf <dig> and two of its receptor proteins  in the yolk sac placenta of the tammar wallaby. to investigate the functional importance of igf <dig> in the placenta, yolk sac explants were cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of exogenous igf <dig> and its effects on vegf expression in the yolk sac examined.

RESULTS
protein localisation in the yolk sac
igf <dig> was largely cytoplasmic in all tissues tested. in the uterus, igf <dig> protein was localised in the cytoplasm of glandular cells in the endometrium and in the uterine epithelium. accumulated staining was observed in the lumen of some, but not all, uterine glands and in a few cells of the uterine stroma . in the yolk sac, igf <dig> protein was detected in the trophoblast and yolk sac endoderm of bilaminar and trilaminar regions, but rarely in the mesenchymal or endothelial cells of vitelline vessels .

igf2r protein co-localised with igf <dig> in the yolk sac, but was also detected in the cell membrane in addition to the cytoplasm . unlike igf <dig>  igf2r staining was similar in both the bilaminar and trilaminar yolk sac and it did not markedly change over the developmental period examined . staining for igf2r was more restricted than igf <dig> in the endometrium, with immuno-reactivity limited to the uterine epithelium. all cells in the bilaminar and trilaminar yolk sac, including the mesenchyme and endothelium, reacted with the igf1r antibody . there was no staining in the igg antibody or no-antibody negative controls. staining for igf1r was common in the endometrium, with reactivity to the endometrial stroma, endometrial glands, and many endothelial cells.

igf <dig> antibody immunoreactivity was stronger in the bilaminar than in the trilaminar yolk sac at all stages examined, but this difference was most notable in the two days before parturition . both the bilaminar and trilaminar yolk sac had less igf <dig> immuno-staining between days  <dig> to  <dig> than at later stages of pregnancy. igf <dig> immunostaining in the trophoblast of the bilaminar and trilaminar yolk sac was consistently stronger than in the yolk sac endoderm . additionally, there was light background staining in the yolk sac endoderm, but not the trophoblast, of igg antibody negative controls . however, background staining was not as intense as staining to the igf <dig> antibody. although there was stronger staining of igf2r in the trophoblast, the intensity of staining was not markedly different from the yolk sac endoderm .

confirming antibody specificity
western blots using protein extracts from both the uterus and placenta detected a single band of approximately  <dig> kd consistent with predicted protein size for igf <dig>  this confirmed that the antibody was specific for tammar igf <dig>  validating the immunohistochemistry .

non-quantitative gene expression
rt-pcr amplified products of the expected size,  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp , which were sequenced to confirm gene identity. blast-n on the sequence of these pcr fragments showed high homology with sequences in other species: tammar igf <dig> showed 95% nucleotide identity to north american opossum igf <dig>  and tammar igf2r showed 99% nucleotide identity to the red-necked wallaby, macropus rufogriseus igf2r . igf <dig> and igf2r mrna was detected in the bilaminar and trilaminar yolk sac of all stages between day  <dig> and day  <dig>  additionally, both genes were expressed in the allantois, adult liver, endometrium, and in the pouch young tail .

quantitative levels of gene expression in vivo and in vitro
contamination by primer dimers was eliminated from analysis by reading sample fluorescence above the primer dimer melting temperatures, as indicated by melting curve analyses, thus ensuring ct values reflected amplification of the target only. melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis also confirmed a single product was obtained for each reaction. β-actin   had no primer dimers and plates could be read at temperatures required for target genes.

all standard curves were linear over three orders of magnitude of yolk sac cdna dilutions, indicating that the primers work over a range of cdna concentrations. a correlation co-efficient above  <dig>  was recorded for the standard curve of all genes examined. standard deviations of ct values from triplicate reactions were on average  <dig>  of a cycle for igf <dig>   <dig>  for igf2r, and  <dig>  for vegf. therefore, within each triplicate all ct values were within  <dig> cycle of each other. if standard deviation within the triplicate was greater than  <dig> , indicating a substantial variation in the estimated ct, all data for those individuals were removed from further analyses.

igf <dig> expression was significantly lower in the bilaminar compared to the trilaminar yolk sac at all stages from days  <dig> to  <dig>  . in both regions of the yolk sac there was a significant increase in igf <dig> expression between days  <dig> to  <dig> and days  <dig> to  <dig> . further, igf <dig> declined at term and this was significant in the bilaminar yolk sac . unlike igf <dig> igf2r expression was similar in the bilaminar and trilaminar yolk sac and did not change markedly over the gestational period examined .

vegf was expressed in the trilaminar yolk sac at all gestational stages examined. a gradual increase in vegf expression was observed for days  <dig> to  <dig> through to days  <dig> to  <dig> . the presence of additional igf <dig>  significantly increased vegf expression in trilaminar yolk sac explants cultured for  <dig> hours compared to control cultures  . at  <dig> hours a similar trend was observed, but was not significant . combining this data with that from the  <dig> hour treatments gives an overall significant increase in vegf expression when igf <dig> was added to the culture medium .

discussion
igf <dig> was expressed in the embryonic, extra-embryonic, and maternal reproductive tissues during the final third of gestation in the tammar. both mrna and protein were present in bilaminar and trilaminar regions of the yolk sac, increasing at days 22– <dig> of the  <dig>  day gestation. at all stages expression was higher in the vascular region of the placenta, although there was little igf <dig> protein in the yolk sac mesenchyme. igf2r and igf1r proteins were in all cells of the placenta, but staining for igf2r, like igf <dig>  was minimal in the mesenchyme. the conserved expression of igf <dig>  in the therian yolk sac suggests that placental expression of igf <dig> predated or evolved with its imprinting in this tissue. vegf was also expressed in the yolk sac placenta of the tammar. vegf expression increased significantly after addition of igf <dig> to cultures of trilaminar yolk sac explants, suggesting that the function of igf <dig> in stimulating angiogenesis may be a conserved feature of mammalian placentation.

expression and function of igf <dig> in the bilaminar and trilaminar yolk sac
in many eutherians, igf <dig> mrna is abundant in trophoblast-derived cell lineages, yolk-sac endoderm and mesoderm, and chorioallantoic mesoderm of eutherians  <cit> . similarly, tammar igf <dig> protein was abundant in analogous cell lineages of the yolk sac – the trophoblast and yolk sac endoderm. however, while igf <dig> mrna expression is high in many mesodermal tissues in eutherians, there was little igf <dig> protein detected in the yolk sac mesenchyme of the tammar. however, igf <dig> mrna expression in the trilaminar yolk sac was higher than in the bilaminar yolk sac

igf <dig> can act as both a mitogen and a differentiation factor, which it does by triggering different signalling pathways  <cit> . the expression of igf <dig> mrna and protein, as well as the co-localisation of both igf receptors in the tammar yolk sac, provides evidence of its function in this tissue. basal igf <dig> expression in the bilaminar yolk sac suggests a constitutive mitogenic role that is likely shared with the trilaminar yolk sac, and is consistent with the localisation of igf1r, the primary mediator of igf <dig> mitogenic activity throughout the yolk sac. high igf <dig> expression in the trilaminar yolk sac may reflect high rates of proliferation in this region during late gestation  <cit> . between days  <dig> and  <dig> the trilaminar yolk sac rapidly expands, from approximately 1/ <dig> of the yolk sac surface to 1/ <dig> by the end of gestation  <cit> .

igf <dig> induction of the mesoderm can be independent of igf <dig> regulation of cellular proliferation  <cit> . the abundance of igf <dig> binding proteins in yolk sac blood vessels of the guinea pig suggests it may also stimulate angiogenesis in this tissue  <cit> . in the tammar placenta, the bilaminar yolk sac is avascular, while the mesodermal layer of the trilaminar yolk sac differentiates into vascular tissue and mesenchyme. the high relative expression of igf <dig> in the trilaminar yolk sac suggests that it may be required for growth and vascularisation of the marsupial placenta during the final third of gestation. although both igf <dig> transcript and protein were found in the trilaminar yolk sac, igf <dig> antibodies did not react with the mesenchyme or endothelium of vitelline vessels. igf <dig> in the mesenchyme may be bound by tissue-specific igf-bps that inhibit its interaction with the antibody.

igf <dig> may also promote vascularisation of the yolk sac indirectly. like igf <dig>  igf2r was found in the trophoblast and yolk sac endoderm, but not the mesenchyme. these results suggest that the primary targets of igf <dig> activity in the yolk sac are the trophoblast and extra-embryonic endoderm. in the eutherian yolk sac, endodermal cells appear critical for the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into angioblasts  <cit> . similarly, development of the yolk sac vasculature in the tammar wallaby may require signals from surrounding igf2-responsive cells .

igf <dig> and vegf
in the mouse, vegf is needed for haematopoiesis, differentiation of endothelial lineages, and neo-vascularisation of developing organs including the placenta  <cit> . igf <dig> may stimulate vascular differentiation of the yolk sac by regulating vegf expression. the present results support this hypothesis. in vivo there was a parallel increase in vegf and igf <dig> expression in the yolk sac during the final third of gestation. although igf <dig> expression declines during days  <dig> to  <dig> of gestation while vegf continues to increase, this is likely to reflect the long half-life of igf <dig> protein in vivo, where it is maintained in labile pools by igf <dig> binding proteins  <cit> . in vitro, vegf expression increased significantly in trilaminar yolk sac explants grown in culture with human-recombinant igf <dig>  it is possible that igf <dig> increased vegf expression in yolk sac cultures by increasing cellular proliferation, rather than stimulating vegf expression directly. this study cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. vegf expression in both control and treatment cultures was higher than in the same stages in vivo, possibly due to igf <dig> contained within the fetal calf serum in the culture medium. the data presented support the suggestion that igf <dig> can increase vegf expression either directly or via an increase in cell numbers in the differentiating vascular yolk sac.

placental function and igf <dig> imprinting
igf <dig> is clearly important in the marsupial placenta during late gestation. moreover, igf <dig> is imprinted in the fetus and placenta of the tammar wallaby  <cit> . organogenesis and rapid growth occur in the final third of gestation in the tammar, and the metabolic needs of the fetus are greatest at this time  <cit> . the increase in trilaminar yolk sac area may facilitate efficient transfer of gases and support fetal metabolism during this phase of rapid growth  <cit> . thus, by stimulating cellular proliferation and survival in the bilaminar and trilaminar yolk sac as well as vascularisation, placental igf <dig> may be critical for the fetus to meet its metabolic requirements.

igf <dig> may also influence nutrient transport through the yolk sac. in the tammar, glucose transport across the yolk sac increases during the final third of gestation  <cit> . insulin typically regulates glucose transport, but not in the rodent yolk sac placenta  <cit> . igf <dig> may, instead, perform this function in the yolk sac and possibly the chorioallantoic placenta, in which glucose transport is also largely insensitive to insulin  <cit> . in bovine endothelial cells igf-bp <dig> enhances glucose transport  <cit>  and igf <dig> increases glucose transport in cultured human cytotrophoblasts  <cit> . however, insulin is also present and imprinted in the marsupial yolk sac  <cit> , so the two may act synergistically.

the placenta is a key site of imprinted gene expression in eutherians and imprinted genes regulate its development and function  <cit> . presumably the growth promoting functions of igf <dig> in the placenta and fetus may explain the maintenance of its imprinting in divergent mammalian species. further, increased vascular development and growth of the yolk sac is needed to maintain fetal growth and the present study establishes the potential for igf <dig> to influence growth and angiogenesis in the placenta of the tammar.

CONCLUSIONS
the expression and proposed functions of igf <dig> in the marsupial placenta suggest this gene has a critical role in placentation in all therian mammals. igf <dig> appears to increase vegf expression and promote vascularisation of the yolk sac of the tammar. this is the first evidence of a physiological role for an imprinted gene in the placenta of any marsupial. the conserved imprinting of igf <dig> in this marsupial with all eutherian species so far investigated, but not in monotremes, suggests that imprinting of this gene may have originated when it acquired a function in the placenta of the therian ancestor.
