BACKGROUND
one of major challenges in the 21st century is the sustainable production of food, fuel and fiber crops with enhanced functional and nutritive value  to meet the demands of an ever-increasing global population
 <cit> . to meet this demand requires the development of alternative more sustainable methods for the production and enhancement of value added agricultural commodities in a way that will have minimal impact on the ecosystem. current agricultural practices are largely based on the use of chemical fertilizers and synthetic pesticides for improved crop growth and yield. however, our dependence and overuse of these fertilizers has resulted in contamination of soil, ground and surface waters. increasing demand for healthier and more nutrient-dense foods by more health-conscious consumers and an improved environmental awareness has resulted in an increased interest in and a rapid change towards eco-friendly sustainable agricultural farming systems.

one component of this new sustainable production system is the use of microbe-based fertilizers  containing potential beneficial strains of microorganism and their metabolites many of which have an important role in conditioning the rhizosphere for improved plant growth and nutrient use efficiency
 <cit> . since the 1970’s we have been cognizant of the potential benefits on plant growth of specialized plant growth promoting rhizobacteria 
 <cit> . there have been many reports on improvements in plant defense, health and growth, resistance to pathogens, enhanced salt tolerance, and improved nutrient uptake in response to pgpr
 <cit>  that could have led to the development of novel agricultural applications. in spite of all these advantages, the use of microbial-based products has not been effectively exploited at larger scales to improve plant yields and most certainly not as a means to selectively enhance gene expression and production of beneficial secondary metabolite in crops.

phenylpropanoids are a large group of polyphenolic compounds that comprise an important class of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, anthocyanin and lignin in plants
 <cit> . phenylpropanoids have important functions in flower coloration, pollinator attraction, protection from ultraviolet  light, as signaling molecules between plants and microbes, and as antioxidants
 <cit> . additionally, when consumed by humans phenylpropanoids offer a myriad of health benefits
 <cit> . there have been many studies on the biosynthesis of flavonols and the pp pathway in general via metabolic engineering targeting important agronomic traits such as the production of novel colors and color patterns in ornamentals
 <cit> . many phenylpropanoids act as inducers of plant-microbe symbioses
 <cit> , whereas others exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and are therefore believed to help plants fight microbial diseases
 <cit> . in addition, several studies have examined how the pp and defense related pathways are regulated by interactions between soil microorganisms and plant roots
 <cit> . the genes involved in pp pathway such as chalcone synthase , chalcone isomerase , flavanone 3-hydroxylase , flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase , and flavonol synthase <dig>  play important roles in the production of secondary metabolites, while dihydroflavonol 4-reductase , and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase  are involved in the production of colored anthocyanidins . after production, these products are further modified by glycosylation, acylation, and methylation in a complex process that changes their stability, solubility, or localization, and thereby the biological properties of the conjugated molecules
 <cit> .

the transcription factors regulating the expression of these structural genes have been well characterized in plant species including arabidopsis <cit> . myb <dig>  myb <dig>  and myb <dig> encode three functionally redundant mybs regulating the expression of several ‘early’ flavonoid biosynthetic genes
 <cit> . on the other hand, tfs such as pap <dig>  pap <dig>  gl <dig>  tt <dig> and ttg <dig> which are components of the myb/bhlh/wdr  transcriptional complexes mediate the ‘late’ anthocyanin biosynthesis genes
 <cit> . the lignin biosynthesis pathway is well-characterized and plays an important role in plant growth, development, increase cell wall integrity, facilitating water transport and providing resistance against pathogen
 <cit> . the genes which are involved in lignin biosynthesis are largely regulated at the transcription level and lignin-specific transcription factor myb <dig>  myb <dig> and snd <dig> can induce the biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of lignin
 <cit> .

to date there is little research aimed at understanding the influence of microbial products on plant secondary metabolism making it difficult to assess a potential functional relationship. understanding how phenylpropanoid metabolism changes in response to microbes or microbial-based products will help to improve our fundamental understanding of plant biology, and would be useful for the development of natural products aimed at improving crop yield and quality. preliminary analysis of the product composition shows that it is composed of pgpr related bacteria and use of the product can result in plant growth promotion
 <cit> . we hypothesized that microbial-based products, known to improve plant growth and nutrient uptake, can induce the pp pathway and lignin pathway in arabidopsis. therefore, this study was designed to evaluate how application and the timing of application  influence the pp pathway in arabidopsis. quantitative real-time pcr  was used in this study for transcriptional profiling of flavonoid and lignin pathway genes, and high performance liquid chromatography  and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry  were used to determine flavonoid content. the results show that application of microbial products induced the pp path-way and there was a different response dependent on application timing. in both cases application of the microbial product induced flavonoid and lignin content in arabidopsis leaves compared to an untreated control.

discussion
expression of flavonoid pathway genes and metabolite composition
our study provides evidence that application of microbial products  to arabidopsis plants increases the accumulation of flavonoids, and that ti resulted in greater accumulation of metabolites than tii treated plants. such enhancement was accompanied by an increased expression of most of the genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. this was particularly prominent in ti treated plants, but there were also elevated expression levels in tii treated plants. synthesis of the derivatives of kaempferol, quercetin, and anthocyanins depend greatly on dihydrokaempferol. meanwhile, f3’h and fls <dig> are crucial to channeling the precursor’s dihydroquercetin/dihydrokaempferol, forming quercetin or kaempferol branches. the up-regulation of f3’h and fls <dig> in ti compared with tii treated plants are consistent with an increase in the amounts of most of flavonol glycosides in arabidopsis leaves . however, in tii treated plants, there was a significant decrease in the amounts of most of flavonol glycosides compared to ti, which is also in accordance with the down-regulation of f3’h and fls <dig> observed in tii treated plants. such difference may be due to the variability of specific substrate, which can make the biosynthetic pathway different, thus producing different products. therefore, the increase of kaempferol-containing flavonols is primarily associated with the accumulation of f <dig>  which is 2-fold higher as compared to f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig> in ti treated plants.

lc-msms analyses detected a strongly increased level of a compound  in acid hydrolyzed samples corresponding to molecular mass  of aglycone kaempferol. consistent with the induced expression of dfr, ldox and uf3gt in both ti and tii treated plants, we observed significant increases in the amount of anthocyanins  in the leaves of arabidopsis as compared to the control . the effect was most prominent for a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> in the ti treated plants wherewith higher accumulation was observed compared to those plants receiving the tii treatment. in contrast, plants treated with tii showed higher accumulation of a <dig> compared to control. the presence of caffeyl, ferulyl, sinapyl and malonyl groups in the accumulated anthocyanins is parallel with the induced expression of anthocyanin acyltransferases, and sat in the present study
 <cit> . the accumulation of these compounds could provide some level of increased defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. for example, the presence of the acylated flavonol glycosides in the leaf hairs of quercus ilex increased the plant’s protection against the damage of uv-b radiation
 <cit> . in another example, rutin showed significant antifungal activity against the fungi cylindrocar pondestructans, phytophthora megasperma, and verticillium dahlia attacking olive trees . rutin is, therefore, believed to play a major role in plant defense
 <cit> . the formation of a large number of glycoslated kaepmferol derivatives and only a small amount of glycosylated anthocyanidins in our study are corroborated by earlier reports
 <cit> .

several gts that are involved in the glycosylation processes and induced expression of ugt75c <dig> and ugt78d <dig> <cit>  are consistent with the expression of fls <dig>  f3’h, and glycosylated flavonol compound biosynthesis in ti and tii treated plants. rhamnosylation is a major glycosylation process of flavonols and the genes responsible for biosynthesis of rhmanose sugar, and is vital in supplying udp-rhamnose for flavonol biosynthesis. enhanced expression of rhm <dig>  rhm <dig> and rhm <dig> in the ti and tii treated plants suggests their possible roles in the formation of rha residue and rhamnosylation of flavonoids. our lc-msms data also suggest that most flavonol accumulation in the microbial treated plants is in the rhamnosylated form. induced expression of rhamnosylated genes was reported in arabidopsis <cit> , confirming previous results that suggest its involvement in rhamnosylation of flavonols in ti and tii treated plants. the induced expression of rhm <dig>  rhm <dig>  and rhm <dig> in our study may be due to either competition of substrate availability, or to changes in the flow of flux in the different branches of the pp pathway, a phenomenon which has been reported in arabidopsis <cit> . these results showed significant variation in flavonoid accumulation, indicating that the accumulation of flavonoid may potentially be manipulated by altering the application timing of the microbial based products.

transcriptional regulation of flavonoid pathway genes
transcriptional regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis structural genes are controlled by regulatory genes, which provide an additional level of control. several myb/bhlh/wd-repeat  family genes have been implicated in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in arabidopsis. among them, pap <dig> is a master regulator of flavonoid/anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway
 <cit> . our results suggest that induced expression of pap <dig> and its close homolog, pap <dig>  are strongly induced in ti and tii treated plants, regulating the flavonoid biosynthesis. interestingly, pap <dig> expression was increased in ti treated plants as compared to pap <dig>  thus, it is reasonable to suggest that pap <dig> expression was stable enough to control flavonoid biosynthesis.

there are several other genes encoding myb and bhlh transcription factors  that are known to be involved in regulating flavonoid biosynthesis in arabidopsis leaves. therefore, the expression of myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig>  gl <dig>  egl <dig>  tt <dig> and ttg <dig> was analyzed. tt <dig> interacts with pap1/pap <dig> <cit> , and the up-regulation of pap1/pap <dig> and tt <dig> genes appears to be required for the activation of anthocyanin structural genes for anthocyanin production in ti treated plants. the closely related myb <dig>  myb <dig>  and myb <dig> tfs are flavonol-specific regulators, and effect flavonol accumulation in different parts of the arabidopsis seedlings by regulating several genes of flavonoid biosynthesis, such as chs, chi, f3’h, and fls <dig> <cit> . consistent with the up-regulation of pap <dig> and pap <dig>  induced expression of myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> genes resulted in an increase in the content of individual flavonol biosynthesis in the ti compared tii treated plants. however, induced expression of pap <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> gene coincided with reduced expression of pap <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> in the tii treated plants, suggesting a balance among myb gene members in controlling the flavonoid biosynthesis in our study. variable regulation of the tfs and regulatory genes in the tii treated plants likely led to the lower amounts of flavonols and anothcyanin and higher amounts of f <dig>  f <dig> and a <dig> observed in these plants.

interestingly, a significant increase in the amounts of a <dig> was noted in the tii as compared to ti treated plants that may have been due to the induced expression of regulatory genes gl <dig> and ttg <dig>  and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes ldox and uf3gt. previous studies have indicated that the mutant of ttg <dig> disrupted the expression of late anthocyanin biosynthetic genes such as dfr and ldox, whereas the expression of ‘early’ anthocyanin biosynthetic genes  is not effected in the same mutant
 <cit> . our results show that genes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids are expressed differently in ti and tii treated plants, which explains why some of the flavonoids are produced in much higher amounts as compared to the control. this clearly indicates some correlation between the biosynthesis of these closely related flavonoids in response to plants receiving the microbe-based soil additive. however, further work is required to understand whether these changes are due to the microbes or metabolites in the product, or the interaction of the two, and if they are acting directly on the plant or indirectly by mediating the interaction of the plant with the surrounding soil.

expression of transcription factors during lignin accumulation
a branch of the pp pathway is responsible for the synthesis of lignins by the coordinated transcription of lignin pathway genes 
 <cit> . ti strongly induced the expression of c4h, 4cl <dig>  hct, c3’h <dig>  ccoaomt <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  comt <dig>  cad <dig>  cad <dig>  cad <dig>  cad <dig>  cad <dig> and sat, whereas tii induction of lignin biosynthesis genes is relatively low, with the exception of hct and f5h <dig>  whose expression levels were higher in the tii compared to ti treated plants . c4h, 4cl <dig>  and hct have been shown to be involved in lignification
 <cit> ; furthermore, the increase in the expression levels of c4h, 4cl <dig>  and hct in the ti and tii treated plant could be linked to the lignification process. ccoaomt <dig> and comt <dig> expression was induced in ti and tii treated plants. ccoaomt <dig> encodes an enzyme involved in monolignol biosynthesis by catalyzing the methylation of caffeyl-coa ester. moreover, in ti treated plants, the up-regulation ccoaomt <dig> and comt <dig> were observed more than those of tii treated plants. overexpression of pap <dig>  in arabidopsis showed increased amounts of guaiacyl and syringyl monomers that were associated with increased lignin accumulation
 <cit> . in vitis vinifera, vvmyb5a, which regulates anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in grapevine, also affects lignin biosynthesis. overexpression of vvmyb5a in tobacco down regulated ccoaomt <dig> gene expression, leading to reduced lignification in anther walls and delayed dehiscence
 <cit> . it was also observed that c4h and comt <dig> genes are regulated by a lignin-specific myb transcription factor myb <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> .

of the two ccr isogenes, ccr <dig> showed higher overall expression levels than ccr <dig> in both ti and tii treated plants, but only plants form ti had greater ccr <dig> expression compared to control. up-regulation of ccr expression has been associated with an increase in lignin formation in arabidopsis <cit> . nine cad genes have been reported in arabidopsis <cit> . the results showed that six members of the cad family genes  accumulated at varying levels, with cad <dig>  cad <dig>  cad <dig> and cad <dig> expression being higher in the ti treated plants compared to tii treated plants . cad <dig> and cad <dig> have been shown to play a major role in lignifications
 <cit> . we observed that cad <dig> and cad <dig> expression was induced to the same degree in both ti and tii treated plants compared to control. a role of cad <dig> in lignification has been shown in young stems, flowers, and siliques of arabidopsis <cit> . cad <dig> expression was detected in secondary growth in hypocotyls of a. thaliana <cit> . a several fold increase in the levels of expression of cad <dig> and cad <dig> was noted in the ti treated plants compared to tii treated plants; however, their expression was increased in the tii treated plants compared to control plants. the higher induced expression levels of cad <dig> compared to cad <dig> was also observed in plantlets and flowers of arabidopsis <cit> . thus, different members of the ccr and cad family genes appear to be induced differently in lignin biosynthesis in plants treated with microbe-derived products. the induced expression of these genes in our study suggested that they might contribute to the biosynthesis of lignin. at2g <dig>  encoding sinapoylglucose:anthocyanin sinapoyltransferase , plays a role in sinapoylmalate synthesis
 <cit>  an increase in the expression levels of sat in the ti and tii treated plant was also noted.

both ccr and cad are critical for lignin biosynthesis, transferred into the cell wall, and polymerized by laccases
 <cit> . the up-regulation of laccases  is accompanied by the up-regulation of several tfs in both ti and tii treated plants responsible for controlling lignin biosynthesis . it was shown that lac <dig> is expressed in vascular bundles and interfascicular fibers; and, that lac <dig> contributes in the interfascicular fibers lignifications
 <cit> . secondary wall associated nac domain protein <dig> , a key transcriptional activator regulating the developmental program of secondary wall biosynthesis
 <cit> , was induced in ti and tii treated plants compared to control . myb <dig> and myb <dig> have been suggested to be specific activators for lignin biosynthesis
 <cit> . the induced expression of these genes in both ti and tii treated plants  suggested that they are actively involved in the lignifications process.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that microbial products applied to the soil of growing plants support our hypothesis and results in induction of the pp pathway and increased metabolite biosynthesis. the one time application of microbial products  produced more metabolites than multiple applications . the higher metabolite biosynthesis in ti compared to tii could be explained by the fact that both ti and tii contained microbial products, while tii applied few times more compared to ti may have indirectly inhibit the metabolite biosynthesis or diverted the metabolites to other metabolic pathway. however, overall flavonoid accumulation was higher in the treated plants, regardless of timing, as compared to the control. such differences in the flavonols and anthocyanin accumulations between ti and tii treated plants can be explained by the differential transcript accumulation of structural and regulatory genes in leaves of arabidopsis. this is one of the first studies to show that microbial products play an important role in activating the pp pathway in leaves of arabidopsis. these results suggest that the mechanism responsible for the enhancement of metabolites could be related to the microorganisms or metabolites in the product, or an interaction of both. innovative approaches are needed such as pyro-sequencing for the identification of specific microbial groups, and metabolomics analysis for the identification of possible bioactive metabolites within the product to evaluate those responsible for activation of the transcriptional cascade observed in this study.
