BACKGROUND
lichens are symbiotic organisms, which are composed of a fungal  and an algal or a cyanobacterial  partner
 <cit> . the fungus is the dominant partner in this symbiosis and provides the algae an optimised space for photosynthesis within the lichen thallus. about 8% of the terrestrial ecosystems are lichen-dominated
 <cit>  and lichens live in some of the harshest climates on earth. lichens are poikilohydric organisms and are unable to actively control the water levels within their thallus. lichens experience frequent drying and wetting cycles, and they can survive long periods of desiccation in an anhydrobiotic state e.g. when growing on exposed rocks, tombstones and trees. lichens can also tolerate this desiccation better than either of the isolated symbiotic partners alone
 <cit> . once lichen is rehydrated, photosynthesis resumes rapidly, typically within minutes
 <cit> .

the desiccation tolerance and rapid re-establishment of photosynthesis have been studied at the biochemical level and through proteomics
 <cit> , but the molecular genetics and functional mechanisms behind these lichen-specific traits remain largely unexplored. the protection against reactive oxygen species  during desiccation and the subsequent restoration of antioxidant pools during rehydration have been previously investigated using detailed enzymatic assays
 <cit> . revealing the genetic mechanisms used by lichens to survive long periods of drought could have applications for crop plant development.

cladonia rangiferina  weber ex f.h.wigg, the grey reindeer lichen, is a fruticose lichen of the northern european and arctic regions. it consists of a fungal partner  and an algal partner , and has been used as our model organism because of its abundance in southern finland. our previous investigation of lichen expressed sequence tags
 <cit>  identified a number of contig consensus sequences that were annotated using gene ontology. these analyses identified candidate actors within the anhydrobiosis systems and established the most basic of genomic foundations required for further molecular genetic analysis of the grey reindeer lichen.

gene expression studies have previously been used to address the molecular interactions and mechanisms that underlie the broadest range of biological processes that include drought resistance
 <cit>  and tolerance
 <cit>  in addition to the characterization of the molecular interface between other candidate mutualisms
 <cit>  and controlled parasitisms. gene expression profiling may be performed by targeted approaches such as qpcr or in situ hybridization or may be performed using more comprehensive genome scale approaches that include the dna microarray
 <cit>  or rna-seq
 <cit> . a few research studies have been performed that investigate lichen gene expression. expression has been studied using the more targeted methods of in situ hybridization
 <cit>  and qpcr
 <cit> . however, no large or genome scale approaches to study lichen gene expression have yet been published.

we have used the dna sequence data from our previous investigation of the lichen transcriptome
 <cit>  to design a custom dna microarray for c. rangiferina  in order to identify the transcripts that are expressed in the lichen thallus during dehydration and rehydration. the earlier transcriptome sequences were prepared to sample the gene space and the normalized cdna libraries were not appropriate for quantitative studies. the aim of this study was to identify the genes most differentially expressed during the rehydration and drying processes and also to establish a more integrative view of the molecular players that contribute to the processes required for lichen desiccation tolerance and the rapid re-establishment of photosynthesis through functional annotation.

RESULTS
sample preparation
lichen tissues collected from wild were subjected to a rehydration and desiccation regime. thallus tissue was sampled at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and 3 hours following rehydration and 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after the commencement of drying. the sample that had been wetting for three hours was considered the wet sample and the sample that had been drying for 24 hours was considered the dry sample. the relative water content  of the samples was measured during the sample collection. the rwc of the samples during wetting was 13% at 15 minutes,  <dig> % at 30 minutes,  <dig> % at one hour and 100% at three hours. the rwc of the samples during drying was  <dig> % at one hour,  <dig> % at three hours, 0% at six hours and 0% at 24 hours. the experimental design is illustrated in figure 
 <dig> and the sample groups and the abbreviations used in this study are summarized in table 
 <dig> 

lichen oligonucleotide microarray design
clustered and assembled lichen unigene sequences from deep sequencing and sanger sequencing data were used to design oligonucleotide probes for the manufacture of a custom dna microarray. two oligonucleotide probes were designed for each of the long sequences  in order to enable the detection of potentially different isoforms of the transcripts. for the sequences shorter than  <dig> nt  a single oligonucleotide probe was designed.

data quality control
the distribution of the probe signal intensities from the microarrays was investigated for equivalence through review of box plots . principal component analysis  of the samples was performed to evaluate group clustering and candidate outlying samples . the data appeared to be of satisfactory quality and no replicates were removed from the analysis. of the  <dig>  probes designed, an average log <dig> signal intensity of over  <dig> was observed for  <dig>  of the transcripts in one or more experimental conditions. this shows that the design includes a significant number of genes that are expressed.

the quality of the samples and the sample relations were further investigated using correlation analysis and clustering using pearson’s metrics . the between sample correlation values varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> , whereas the within sample group correlation values were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . this illustrates a high reproducibility between the biological replicates.

qrt-pcr validation
the transcript identified as cr_lrc <dig> was chosen as the endogenous control in the qrt-pcr analysis because it demonstrated similar signal-intensity values across all of the samples, and demonstrated suitability as a control gene. five other transcripts selected for the qrt-pcr validation  also had steady intensity values across the samples. the transcripts cr_lrc <dig>  cr_c <dig>  cr_c <dig> and cr_lrc <dig> had different expression levels between the samples. three of the designed assays failed in the qrt-pcr validations. transcript cr_c <dig> had low intensity levels in all samples and thus probably failed. the amplicon designed in the assay for cr_dmini_673h <dig> was 110 bp in length whereas for the other assays the amplicons were 60–70 bp. this could be the reason for the assays failure. the third failed assay was cr_lrc <dig> 

the microarray and qrt-pcr results corresponded well  with  <dig> % of the measurements giving similar results with both methods. the relative quantitation values of some transcripts varied significantly between the samples in some sample groups in the qrt-pcr analysis .

annotation
the microarray design includes  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes for analysis of gene expression in lichen samples. since c. rangiferina is a symbiotic organism it is composed of both fungal and algal partners and the probes on the dna microarray may represent either fungal or algal genes. the genome of origin for the lichen est sequences used in the microarray probe design was predicted using eclat
 <cit> .  <dig> % of the est sequences used in the microarray probe design are predicted to be of algal origin while the remaining  <dig> % are predicted to be fungal sequences. the classification is included in the annotation of the full differentially expressed gene lists available as additional files

since no lichen reference genome has yet been published, an annotation of the transcript sequences was performed using a blastx homology-based approach. annotation could not be assigned to  <dig>  probes  because their target sequences did not demonstrate a blast match exceeding the required statistical threshold of 1e- <dig>   <dig>   transcript sequences corresponded to ncbi non-redundant database entries annotated as “conserved hypothetical proteins”, “hypothetical proteins” or “predicted proteins”.  <dig> % of transcript sequences could be assigned to an unambiguous and natively annotated reference protein.

differentially expressed transcripts
the thresholds for assigning differentially expressed  transcripts from either the mycobiont and photobiont were selected from the plotted volcano plots and heat maps . the numbers of de transcripts in the different comparisons are shown in table

the number of the differentially expressed transcripts differs between the comparisons; w1h vs. wet shows only  <dig> de transcripts while w15m vs. dry comparison yielded  <dig>  de transcripts. also the ratio of up- and down-regulated transcripts varies from comparison to comparison. the w1h vs. wet comparison reveals an even distribution where approximately half of the de transcripts are up-regulated. wet vs. dry comparison suggests  <dig> up-regulated transcripts and only  <dig> down-regulated transcripts.

the de transcripts from each comparison were compared to one another to find out the number of transcripts that the comparisons have in common . uniformity of expressed transcripts is observed across both dry and wet comparisons, and across the wetting and drying sample groups with the exception of group w15m.

the most differentially expressed transcripts do not have clear sequence orthologues or show sequence similarity to only hypothetical proteins. an analysis of the de transcripts was performed using only the top de transcripts with annotation derived from primary annotation sources rather than passaged secondary annotations . the most common up-regulated genes were caax farnesyltransferase alpha subunit, u <dig> snrnp component, nuclear pore complex subunit nup <dig>  swr1p complex component and cytochrome p <dig> family protein. the most common down-regulated genes on the other hand were heat shock protein hsp <dig>  ion channel, nitrite reductase and siroheme synthase.

up = up-regulated genes, down = down-regulated genes, a = algal sequence, f = fungal sequence.

the w15m sample group had only one gene in common with the other comparison groups; the nuclear pore complex subunit nup <dig> in up-regulated w15m vs. dry comparison. however, four of the five top annotated up-regulated de genes and all top five annotated down-regulated de genes were the same in w15m vs. wet and w15m vs. dry comparisons.

hierarchical clustering of the expression values of the annotated transcripts
the expression values of the genes with primary annotations were clustered across all samples to investigate trends in the differential expression of genes across the sample groups. the clustering of the top  <dig> well-annotated de genes is shown in figure 
 <dig>  for the full clustering heat map see additional file
 <dig>  similar to the clustering of the individual sample groups , the w15m samples differ significantly from the other samples in this heat map. the drying and wetting samples form the two main clusters.

functional analysis of the de gene lists
functional annotation was performed using gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  databases. for the functional analysis, lower threshold values for both fold change  and p-value  were applied in order to include a larger number of transcripts in the input list. with these less stringent thresholds more transcripts were selected and finer changes within go terms can be observed. the full tables containing the over-represented go terms for each comparison are presented as additional file
 <dig>  an enrichment analysis of kegg pathways was also performed, but an insufficient number of genes could be assigned to pathways to enable an interpretable analysis.

discussion
lichens are resilient organisms and can endure desiccation for long periods at a time. even after a long period of desiccation they can resume photosynthesis rapidly, typically within minutes, upon rehydration. lichen desiccation tolerance has been studied at the biochemical level
 <cit> , but little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind this interesting phenomenon and ability to survive in harsh environments. we have studied the changes in gene expression of cladonia rangiferina during drying and wetting by designing a custom microarray. the objective of our research was to obtain a better insight into the desiccation tolerance of c. rangiferina and identify the genes most differentially expressed during drying and wetting.

the reindeer lichen is a symbiotic organism containing a mycobiont  and an algal photobiont . the expressed transcripts in the lichen thallus may be derived from either of these genomes. since we specifically intended to study desiccation- and rehydration-induced gene expression of the whole symbiotic lichen, which has been shown to tolerate desiccation better than either of its isolated partners
 <cit> , the microarray design was based on sequences prepared from whole lichen tissue. the genome of origin for these poly-adenylated cdna-based est sequences have been classified as fungal or algal sequences on the basis of discriminative models derived using available axenically cultured sequences
 <cit>  to obtain an estimate of the ratio of algal and fungal genes in the lichen.

similarly also the rna samples, which were hybridized to the microarray, contain rna molecules from both of the symbionts. lichens are also known to contain internal bacterial communities
 <cit>  and bacterial contamination is a possibility with sample material collected from the wild, but the bacterial rna molecules possibly present in the samples should not hybridize to lichen based microarray probes.

samples were collected at different time points during rehydration and desiccation and the rwc was measured from each time point studied. 24 hours was selected as the final sample time-point because beyond this point no changes in lichen tissue weight were observed. the starting lichen material was dried only in room temperature under normal laboratory conditions and therefore the rwc of the starting material can be higher than measured. the d6h and dry samples could have obtained moisture from air humidity during the drying process thus explaining why we were able to detect transcriptomic effects in these samples although the rwc values were so low.

the correlation values between the samples show variability, but the within group correlation values are high  indicating heterogeneous sample groups and homogenous replicates within sample groups. the metabolic processes taking place during wetting and desiccation were hypothesized to be large, systemic changes, which is reflected with the lower between sample correlation values and the high number of differentially expressed transcripts despite the strict filtering thresholds .

within the de transcript lists , the percentage of unannotated genes is enriched when compared to the whole data. in many of the comparisons the percentage of unannotated de transcripts is close to 50% and the highest percentage is  <dig> % within the wet vs. dry comparison. this enrichment of unannotated transcripts within the strictly filtered lists could suggest that these may be lichen-specific or -adapted genes. it would also seem likely that these lichen-specific transcripts would be differentially expressed especially during the early stages of wetting and drying. when using more permissive thresholds for filtering the distribution of unannotated transcripts appears similar to the whole data  illustrating that these putative lichen-specific transcripts really are key players in the molecular mechanisms underpinning anhydrobiosis. the most abundantly represented transcripts in the rehydrated tortula ruralis, a desiccation-tolerant bryophyte, also did not have any matches to known sequences
 <cit> .

our results suggest that the molecular responses happening in the beginning of rehydration are different from the later stages of wetting and also from drying. this can be seen at the level of the whole data , as the difference of the expression profile of the top de genes in w15m sample  and also as the uniqueness of the top up- and down-regulated genes in the w15m comparisons . the enriched up-regulated go terms in w15m sample suggest that cellular responses involved in molecule transport and localization  are active in the early stages of rehydration.

the differential expression of some genes, like short chain dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase , and the enrichment of certain go terms continues past the initial rehydration. alcohol dehydrogenases take part in detoxification reactions
 <cit> , and therefore their up-regulation could reflect the detoxification of ros and other harmful metabolites accumulated during desiccation. alcohol dehydrogenase deficient plants have been shown to be more susceptible to osmotic stress in tomato
 <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , and as alcohol dehydrogenase family proteins function in the polyol synthesis pathway, their activity could contribute towards protection against water deficiency
 <cit> . transcripts are known to accumulate during drying in desiccation-tolerant plants
 <cit>  minimizing the time needed to restart growth upon rehydration. several go terms involved in molecule transport are enriched in the w15m sample as well as in the w30m sample, and could potentially reflect this activation of pools of transcripts available in the lichen tissue.

as the rehydration continues, biosynthetic and metabolic processes become more active in c. rangiferina as suggested by the enriched go terms in the w30m sample . these processes are active also in the w1h sample  and it would seem logical that processes involved in the synthesis of proteins and other molecules are activated in the rehydrated lichen. however, it seems that these biosynthetic and metabolic processes are less active in the wet sample than in the w30m and w1h samples. the cellular responses that encompass the entire rehydration process are all related to the binding of nucleic acids.

the up-regulation of the heat shock protein hsp <dig>  and the enrichment of response to stress term  in the wet sample indicate that already three hours’ full hydration is a source of stress for c. rangiferina. heat shock proteins are induced in various environmental stress responses
 <cit> , and it has previously been found that desiccation-tolerant lichens find 48 hours storage in moist mildly stressful
 <cit> . desiccation-tolerant lichens are in general more adapted to short bursts of hydration with long intervals of desiccation and therefore long periods of full rehydration may potentially be a stressful situation for them.

when the lichen starts to dry, the gene expression profiles are similar to those observed during rehydration . after three to six hours of dehydration several biosynthetic and metabolic processes are still active in the lichen , but the expression profile has changed . the acyl-transferase activities increase during these later stages of dehydration  and the up-regulation of u <dig> snrnp component gene was detected during the whole drying process . a u <dig> snrnp-associated protein is up-regulated by cold stress in arabidopsis <cit>  and smallrnas as well as ribosome binding proteins are involved in regulating plant responses to abiotic stresses
 <cit> .

according to our results, ion channel is up-regulated in the dry sample . damage to the plasma membrane may be the main cause of death during desiccation
 <cit> , and resurrection plants have been shown to utilize cell wall modification to enhance desiccation tolerance
 <cit> . this observed up-regulation of a transcript coding for an ion channel protein could potentially reflect the protection of cellular integrity that is found integral for desiccation tolerance in plants
 <cit> .

our findings suggest that some genes are involved in both the rehydration and dehydration process. nuclear pore complex subunit nup <dig>  swr1p complex component and cytochrome p <dig> family protein genes are differentially expressed in most drying and wetting samples . nup <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved nucleoporin with a preferential location at the inner site of the nuclear membrane
 <cit> , and nucleoporins have been shown to play critical roles in gene regulation
 <cit> . in plants nucleoporins have been found necessary to survive cold stress
 <cit> , and essential for the symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi
 <cit> . swr1p is a member of the swi2/snf <dig> family of atp-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes
 <cit> , and it regulates the deposition of histone at repressed promoters and allows for the rapid activation of transcription in yeast
 <cit> . a gene encoding a snf <dig> domain-containing protein was identified as dehydration-upregulated in the resurrection plant xerophyta humilis <cit> . cytochrome p <dig> proteins on the other hand have been shown to catalyse a wide variety of reactions in plant
 <cit>  and fungal
 <cit>  primary and secondary metabolism and the production of secondary metabolites often depends on many species-specific p450s
 <cit> . a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme transcript has been shown to be significantly accumulated in rapidly dried and subsequently rehydrated tortula ruralis <cit> .

while we have demonstrated the differential expression of hundreds of genes in the drying and wetting lichen, these changes all occur within hours of profound changes to water content. in field conditions there will likely be finer changes as atmospheric moisture partially rewets the lichen. this study does not address the anhydrobiosis phenomena where tissues can remain viable for months under the dried conditions – this is likely controlled well beyond the 24 hour point to which we characterized the drying process. this study does however provide insight into the molecular activities associated with the beginning dehydration and has identified many apparently novel genes that will be of value in subsequent studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have studied the changes in gene expression of cladonia rangiferina during rehydration after desiccation and dehydration after full hydration. our data suggests that these events affect the expression levels of hundreds of genes at a statistically significant level. the wetting and drying events differ from each other at the molecular level, but the largest changes to gene expression are observed minutes after rehydration. these changes are unique to the early stages of rehydration and are not shared with the later stages of wetting or with drying. due to lack of annotation for lichen sequences, most of the differentially expressed transcripts are currently novel showing no sequence similarity to known genes. these candidate lichen-specific genes may contribute to the molecular mechanisms required by the organism to tolerate long periods of desiccation. several of the identified genes are similar to genes identified in other studies analysing the desiccation mechanisms of desiccation-tolerant organisms. an analysis of the functional annotation of differentially expressed genes was also performed and it gives an illustrative view of the different biological responses displayed in the lichen thallus during rehydration and desiccation. we have presented here the first microarray experiment for any lichen species and have for the first time studied the genetic mechanisms behind lichen desiccation-tolerance at the whole transcriptome level.
