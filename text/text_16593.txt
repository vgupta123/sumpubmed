BACKGROUND
the complex structured and crowded intracellular conditions  <cit>  have a tremendous impact on intracellular reactions. accordingly, the in vivo rate constants or even the structure of the kinetic rate expression can significantly differ from those obtained in in vitro assays  <cit> . first of all, the crowded conditions squeeze all molecules closer together which favors the formation of more compact complexes  <cit> . associations or more general bimolecular reactions are governed by the occurrence of collisions of the respective molecules. the frequency of the collisions, in turn, depends on the mobility of the molecules. molecular crowding and especially the cytoskeleton structure lead to a reduction in the diffusion rate, which depends on the size of the molecules  <cit> . via the collision based principle of  reactions this also translates into reduced reaction rates  <cit> . in this context, it is also worth noting that anomalous  diffusion, which was observed in crowded systems  <cit> , leads to time-dependent - fractal - reaction rate constants  <cit> .

in order to investigate the effects of a given intracellular state on the reaction rate, we have developed an agent-based simulation which tracks individual molecules through a virtual cell containing a model cytoskeleton   <cit> . the irregular cellular architecture requires an off-lattice continuous space monte carlo method in which all structures are modeled explicitly as static obstacles. as long as no active transport e.g. by motor proteins is introduced, the molecules of interest move solely by diffusion, which translates into a random walk in the present simulation. obviously, steps into the obstacles are prohibited which enforces to a tortuous way of the mobile molecules around the obstacles. the resulting effective diffusion has been explored for example in  <cit> . since the molecules still move with their initial 'speed' - just on a detouric way, the measurement of the displacement will return d <dig> if sampled on short distances/times and a reduced deff on longer distances. therefore, deff is transiently converging to a fixed long time diffusion coefficient. the corresponding crossover time/distance depends inter alia on the level of crowding  <cit> .

the mobility of the reactants is not the only factor determining the effective in vivo reaction rate. research on the interactome, describing the reactions between proteins, metabolites, and further biomolecules, has revealed a multitude of interactions for each molecule species  <cit> . proteins, for example, can unspecifically bind to cytoskeleton structures, which in turn leads to a further reduction in their mobility  <cit> . the decreased effective diffusion coefficient reduces the collision probability between reactants and can thus reduce the reaction rate if the reaction is significantly diffusion limited.

while the adsorption  and subsequent immobilization hampers the reactions  <cit>  , it is the prerequisite to assign the proteins to specific locations in the cell. this is of particular importance in the following cases:

• metabolic channeling  <cit>  describes the concept of enzyme co-localization along the cytoskeleton  <cit> , which can be highly regulated  <cit> . it has been suggested that metabolites are processed in this channel like in an assembly line, for example in glycolysis . binding to actin filaments can also lead to an allosteric activation of the enzymes  <cit> .

• regulation of signal transduction: cells are subject to many and sometimes contradictory signals. the information is carried from the receptors in the plasma membrane towards the nucleus by signaling molecules. especially in multi-stage cascades, for example in mapk  signaling, this transfer can be regulated by scaffolds. the scaffolds integrate several stages of the cascade in one place   <cit> . scaffolding proteins can regulate signal transduction  <cit>  and furthermore the crosstalk with other signaling pathways  <cit> . it was also found that the subcellular localization of the molecules matters in signal transduction  <cit> . signaling molecules can likewise bind to actin filaments, which was reported for nf-κb and its inhibitor iκb  <cit> . thus the molecules are sequestered from the cytosol. only with the right fraction of unbound molecules the correct signal is transmitted  <cit> .

• pharmacokinetics and drug detoxification: if drug molecules bind to proteins or membranes, they are likewise sequestered from the cytoplasm. this reduces both their action and their degradation, for example by enzymes of the cyp family in the liver  <cit> .

all these details are omitted in models based on differential equations in which only the number/concentration of the species is tracked. the general compartmentalization of the organism/cell can be included in the model if the respective compartments and transport rates are defined  <cit> . spatial aspects like the transport from the plasma membrane towards the nucleus in case of signaling molecules were also investigated with partial differential equations  <cit> . however, all approaches based on differential equations are based on  mean values and neglect the detailed, microscopic aspects in the cell, for instance a micro-compartmentalization along the cytoskeleton.

a particle or agent based simulation allows exploring the effects introduced by the spatial organization of the cell including  binding to the cytoskeleton. the in silico simulation environment also enables to change just one parameter of the complex setup for a comprehensive study of the individual crowding, structuring, or binding effects within a realistic environment. this paper presents the results of a brownian dynamics particle based simulation covering diffusion and reaction rates in a virtual cell. the effects of the cytoskeleton and transient binding on the mobility of tracer molecules are evaluated, and the respective effective reaction rates are analyzed. eventually, different spatial distributions of enzymes in the cell are tested in order to compare the effect of the formation of enzyme channels with homogeneously distributed enzymes. the simulation framework is described in the methods section.

RESULTS
the simulations are performed in a small model cell with a diameter of  <dig> μm . the cytoskeleton structure is created by  <dig>  randomly arranged cylinders with a length of  <dig>  μm and a diameter of  <dig> nm. in addition,  <dig>  immobile crowding spheres with a diameter of  <dig> nm are placed in the cell. cylinders and spheres together occupy 24% of the volume in agreement with experimental results  <cit> . for tracer molecules with a radius of  <dig>  nm, the excluded volume fraction ∈ increases to  <dig> % due to their own volume. the respective volume fractions were sampled using a monte-carlo testing method.

effective diffusion
the mean squared displacement  of diffusing molecules should increase linearly with time according to   

where d is the given dimension  <cit> . the effective diffusion coefficient in a given intracellular condition can hence be calculated from the resulting displacement. the effective diffusion for tracer molecules with a radius of  <dig>  nm through the present sample cell was accordingly calculated from the msd in the simulation to deff /d <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig> . this slowdown is in agreement with previous studies of the impact of the cytoskeleton structure on the diffusion of inert  tracer molecules for the given excluded volume fraction  <cit> .

the slowdown of the diffusion can also be explained by the local confinement of the obstacles  <cit> . in our model cell the random cytoskeleton/crowding structures create a multitude of randomly arranged confinement boundaries. the uniformly distributed test molecules in the cell sample the average effect of these boundaries in their joint msd measure. initially, a nonlinear diffusion can be observed, due to the fact that most particles can move a few steps before they hit an obstacle  <cit> . accordingly the msd grows proportional to the original diffusion coefficient d <dig> in the beginning, and later on proportional to the average deff.

if tracers bind transiently to the cytoskeleton and are therefore temporarily immobilized, the effective diffusion coefficient is further reduced . the simulation shows that this reduction is proportional to the steady state fraction of unbound molecules :   

effective reaction rates
diffusion-controlled reactions
the theory of diffusion controlled reactions requires to take into account the following points  <cit> :

• diffusion limit: the maximal reaction rate constant for a bimolecular reaction of two spherical molecules i and j with radius ri and rj is: kd = 4π   <cit> . it equals the collision rate of the molecules. 

• microscopic reaction rate constant: if not every encounter between two reactants leads to a reaction, the microscopic reaction rate constant kmicro determines the fraction of collisions which lead to subsequent reactions.

• effective macroscopic/bulk reaction rate constant: the resulting reaction rate constant which is observed on the macroscopic level, corresponding to the rate constant of ode models is determined as  <cit> :   

test setup
the test molecules in the simulation are enzyme e and substrate s molecules with the following properties: radius re = rs =  <dig>  nm and diffusion coefficient of d =  <dig> μm2/s. this leads to a diffusion limit of the reaction rate of kd =  <dig>  ×  <dig> l/. the chosen macroscopic reaction rate for a test simulation can be given as a fraction of kd allowing a dimensionless survey of effects on the reaction rate. in the following, rates of kmacro =  <dig>  ×  <dig> l/ , kmacro =  <dig>  ×  <dig> l/ , and kmacro =  <dig>  ×  <dig> l/  are tested.

the resulting reaction rate can be accessed from the change in the number of molecules. the noise in a stochastic simulation, however, hampers the identification of the current reaction rate. if the considered species is, in turn, created and destroyed by two reactions, it will accumulate to a dynamic equilibrium steady state. averaging the steady state number over time reduces the stochastic noise in the result. this situation can be found in vivo in the sequence of enzymatic reactions, for example in glycolysis as shown in figure  <dig> 

in order to reduce the complexity, the considered substrate species s is created in a zero order reaction with rate constant k <dig>  it is consumed in the enzymatic reaction s + e → p + e, which is modeled here with mass action kinetics based on the rate constant k <dig>  the number of enzymes e  is not affected by this reaction. ce is set to  <dig> × 10- <dig> mol/l . the macroscopic balance equation for the substrate concentration is in this model   

which leads to the equilibrium steady state   

detailed simulation vs. ode-model
this section compares the outcome of the detailed stochastic simulation with the result of the macroscopic ode-model of figure  <dig>  in order to elucidate the differences between diluted in vitro and crowded in vivo conditions, one simulation is conducted in an empty 'in vitro' virtual cell and one in the crowded model cell described above.

the steady state of the 'in vitro' reaction rate for both the predicted ) and simulated molecule numbers is given in table  <dig>  showing that the simulation is able to reproduce the macroscopic reaction rates correctly under the 'in vitro' conditions.

comparison of the steady state molecule numbers ns for the 'in vitro' setup.

the situation is quite different in the 'in vivo' case. while r <dig> = k <dig> is held constant in the simulation, the bimolecular reaction is affected by the crowded intracellular conditions. the rate for the second reaction becomes   

the steady state shifts accordingly to   

in order to understand the corresponding change in the reaction rate, the overall effect  is broken down into the following three factors:

 <dig>  the first factor arises from the reduced free volume fraction , which leads to an increased effective concentration of the reactants  . this factor has to be added only once  in the mass action reaction framework dcs/dt = k2cecs because cs appears both on the right and the left side of the equation. instead of using effective concentrations, the respective factor can also be applied to the reaction rate constant, which leads to an apparent reaction rate of . accordingly the in vitro reaction rate has to be multiplied with a factor   

 <dig>  the reduced effective diffusion has an influence on the reaction rate because it reduces the collision rate. for the present analysis it is assumed that the molecules react in the same way in vivo and in vitro, i.e. the microscopic reaction rate constant  stays the same . the effect of the reduced diffusion on the reaction rate can be calculated using β: = k2/kd , leading to   

 <dig>  the hindered accessibility of the molecules due to steric effects of nearby obstacles contributes a further reduction f access of the reaction rate . using a monte-carlo sampling method of the respective volume fraction this factor was estimated to f access =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the given virtual cell.

in combination the effective macroscopic bimolecular reaction rate is accordingly:   

results of the effective reaction rate in the virtual cell. the free volume fraction for the test spheres with a radius of  <dig>  nm is ϕ =  <dig>  in the detailed model cell used for the simulations, leading to f volume =  <dig> . alternatively the crowding effect is included by homogenizing the obstacles in the whole cell. the cell size is reduced by a factor of  <dig>  in order to yield the same reduced volume and the diffusion is artificially and homogeneously reduced accordingly to the values of the detailed cell. since no obstacles are present, f access =  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  section  <dig> shows the corresponding temporal development of ns in the 'in vitro' and 'in vivo' simulation, including the evaluation of the performance of the simulation.

in order to understand this result, it is necessary to recall the transient anomalous diffusion in the crowded environment. at short distances, the molecules still move with their original  diffusion coefficient. only on longer distances the tortuous way around the obstacles leads to a reduced mobility. the results indicate that the diffusion limited bimolecular reaction senses an intermediary effective diffusion coefficient which is slower than d <dig> but faster than the long term effective deff . this argument is supported by the stronger deviation of the result of the more diffusion limited reaction k2/kd =  <dig> .

future work could investigate this effect with respect to the local confinement, and also include the influence of unspecific and transient binding on the reaction rate, i.e. the nullified mobility of one or both of the reactants due to binding to cellular structures. in addition, also the combined action of individual reaction rate constants for different sub-states of a molecule  could be analyzed in a more complex model.

enzyme co-localization and metabolic channeling
this section considers more than one reaction of the enzymatic conversion of the metabolites in the cell. the pathway is simplified to a sequence of  <dig> reactions as shown in figure 6a. first the substrate  is transported across the plasma membrane, then it is converted enzymatically, and finally the  product is transported out of the cell .

the aim of the present simulations is to elucidate the effect of the localization of the enzymes. the most optimal setup promises to be the enzyme channel  of figure 6b in which the enzymes are co-localized  and aligned in the order of the reactions. since the substrate enters the cell through the plasma membrane, the enzymes should be localized there . since it is not clear, whether the enzymes arrange in a sequential complex or are just randomly attached to the actin filaments  <cit>  close to the surface, also a dense but unstructured enzyme layer  is modeled for comparison. these structured setups are furthermore compared to a uniform random distribution  of the enzymes in the cell and a well mixed  model based on ode . this means that the spatial aspects are completely neglected and only the molecule numbers are tracked in .

all enzymes are immobilized in the simulation, i.e. they stay at their fixed initial position with an artificial de =  <dig>  therefore it is not necessary to include the cytoskeleton filaments as structuring elements as well as the enzyme binding to the cytoskeleton, which would increase the complexity of the model. this nicely underscores the advantage of in silico simulations in which the different factors affecting the reaction rates in the cell can be separated.

the metabolites are moving with a diffusion coefficient of  d =  <dig> μm2/s and  d =  <dig> μm2/s for a comparison of the mobility effects. the macroscopic reaction rate constant is set to k =  <dig>  ×  <dig> l/, which is fairly fast but not extremely diffusion limited  for d =  <dig> μm2/s, and kd =  <dig>  ×  <dig> l/ for d =  <dig> μm2/s) - see additional file  <dig>  section  <dig> 

since all setups are conducted with the same number of enzymes and the same reaction rates, they produce similar results . the deviations are stronger for the more diffusion limited case - i.e. the lower diffusion d =  <dig> μm2/s. the overall development of the individual metabolite pools is shown in the additional file  <dig>  section  <dig>  it is worth noting that the export rate of metabolite  <dig> is diffusion controlled in the setups -. especially in the randomly distributed setup , metabolite  <dig> can be created deep inside the cell and has to diffuse all the way back to the plasma membrane. this leads to a stronger accumulation of the metabolite in the cell compared to the well-mixed ode-model .

likewise the setups where the enzymes are close to the plasma membrane  or layer ) lead to a faster formation of the product because the substrate enters the cell through the plasma membrane . this is clearly visible in the excerpt of the initial phase shown in figure 6c. due to the optimal location of the enzymes, the product formation is even faster than in the well-mixed ode-model. locally the enzyme concentration is much higher than the average concentration in the cell - right where it is needed. interestingly, the product formation rate is much faster for the slower diffusion - in this case the metabolites stay longer in the vicinity of the plasma membrane where they can interact with the enzymes. as such, the cell has become compartmentalized although no explicit compartments are defined.

the setup where the respective enzymes are co-localized in an enzyme channel indeed shows the fastest  product formation rate. it can be expected that the differences between the enzyme distributions tested in this paper will increase if the michaelis-menten enzyme kinetics is used. the high local enzyme concentration close to the surface leads to a locally higher vmax value - right were the highest substrate concentration is found in the given setup. accordingly, the reactions in the channeled and layered setups should become even faster.

the improved reaction rate in the co-localized channel structure is in agreement with the findings of bauler et al.  <cit> , which found that a sequential reaction is faster if the two active zones of the respective enzymes are aligned to face each other in a brownian dynamics simulation. however, it should be noted that the faster reaction rate arises solely from the fact that the intermediate metabolites have a higher probability to hit the next enzyme within the next diffusion steps in the simulation but are still allowed to diffuse away. in reality, the metabolites might be directed through the entire enzyme complex, which leads to a completely different description of the overall reaction. the analysis of the latter effect, in turn, requires a molecular dynamics study based on the molecular multi enzyme structure of the proposed channeling complex. experimental observations  <cit>  indicate that indeed enzyme channels might be formed in vivo. however, the theoretical analysis did not yet identify channeling as the only possibility to describe the observed kinetics  <cit> .

the present study shows that the location of the reactants  can play an important role. this work focused on the influence of spatial aspects and the possible enzyme co-localization, which allows a more realistic study of enzyme channeling properties. future work could include more advanced reaction kinetics in order to verify channeling, as well as a study of the resulting control properties on the metabolic flux  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present simulation allows a detailed analysis of the effects of the intracellular properties on the reaction rates. the results have shown that the in vivo reaction rate differs from the in vitro reaction rate. the difference is related to the crowded conditions in the cell and three factors, namely  the increased effective concentration,  the reduced accessibility of the reactants, and  the reduced mobility of the reactants could be determined.

in addition, the influence of the subcellular localization of the reactants was tested. the results show that the co-localization of enzymes in a metabolic-channeling framework can improve the product formation. it is worth noting that the advantage of a specific location of the enzymes is accompanied by the disadvantage of the reduced enzyme mobility. hence the reaction rate will be reduced in the diffusion limited case. this reduction could even outbalance the superior product formation rate of enzyme channeling. since this depends on the actual diffusion and reaction rate constants, further simulations are required in order to quantify the advantage of the channel configuration - especially in the context of a more advanced kinetics within the multi-enzyme-complex.

thus the present simulation framework is a promising tool to investigate intracellular reactions and signal transduction processes in the detailed spatial organization of the cell  <cit> . if all intracellular factors are put together correctly, the simulation will return a prediction for the in vivo reaction rate. as such, the present simulation method enables to reconstruct the in vivo properties in silico.

on the way to a model which is in agreement with living cells, several parameters like the correct cytoskeleton structure, molecular crowding, and additional unspecific interactions which can for example transiently immobilize the molecules have to be adjusted, giving a deeper insight into the cell  <cit> . the resulting detailed in silico cell can also be visualized by advanced and interactive visualization tools, thus providing a powerful virtual microscope  <cit> .
