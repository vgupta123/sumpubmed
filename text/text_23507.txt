BACKGROUND
sequence motifs in dna and rna molecules are key players in the regulation of gene expression. proteins and rna molecules bind to these motifs in a sequence-specific way to control transcription and subsequent sequestration or degradation of messenger rna . high-throughput sequencing technology has given us access to genome-wide measurements of mrna levels  as well as protein-dna  or protein-rna  interactions
 <cit> . advances in protein-binding microarrays and high-throughput variants of selex have recently been used to produce large compendia of both dna
 and rna motifs
 <cit> . these two threads of technological advancement provide the necessary inputs for very productive analyses of the regulatory roles of sequence motifs associated with particular dna- or rna-binding molecules.

in this paper we describe a methodology for detecting sequence motifs that are enriched in one set of sequences relative to another set. this is called differential motif enrichment analysis , and is a type of motif enrichment analysis
 <cit> . motif enrichment analysis differs from de novo motif discovery in that a set of known, well-characterized motifs are part of the input to motif enrichment analysis. motif enrichment analysis has two major strengths relative to motif discovery. firstly, because the motifs come from curated motif databases, the identities of the biological molecules that bind them are known. secondly, restricting attention to the curated set of motifs increases statistical power, allowing more subtle motif enrichments to be detected. this latter advantage is simply a consequence of the huge number of possible sequence motifs that de novo motif discovery must consider.

the dmea approach we describe also takes advantage of positional information, in contrast to other motif enrichment analysis approaches, such as ame
 <cit> , which measure enrichment over a whole genomic region. for example, chip-seq and clip-seq technologies identify the  loci where a protein interacts with dna or rna, respectively. the resolution of the loci depends on the technology and is approximately  <dig> bp for chip-seq
 <cit> . dmea can leverage this fact by focusing on motifs that are enriched in the central  <dig> bp portion relative to the flanks, of genomic regions identified by chip-seq. this is the approach taken by the original centrimo algorithm
 <cit> , and is still available in the enhanced version of that algorithm that we describe here. a fortunate side-effect of using positional information in this way is that the flanking regions provide a built-in negative control for the statistical test of motif enrichment.

positional information can also be leveraged by dmea when motifs occur at preferred locations anywhere  within the input sequences. examples of where this is useful include promoters for expressed genes aligned on their start of transcription  or chip-seq regions aligned on the best match to the known motif of the binding protein. in the former case, regulatory motifs frequently occur at preferred locations relative to the tss . in the latter case, co-regulatory proteins frequently bind in particular configurations
 <cit> . in the new version of the centrimo algorithm described here, we allow the user to relax the requirement that the enriched region be centrally located. this allows centrimo to be applicable in a wider range of scenarios.

the major contribution of this paper is to describe and illustrate differential local motif enrichment analysis. we show that dmea can identify biologically relevant motifs that are relatively enriched in one set of chip-seq peaks compared to another. importantly, in the example we study here, these relevant motifs are not detected without the use of differential analysis. in addition, we apply differential enrichment analysis to two sets of promoters, bound or unbound by a particular transcription factor, and detect a number of motifs for physiologically relevant motifs. our analyses are based on published chip-seq data in transformed and untransformed versions of an immortalized breast cell line, but the approach is completely general and can yield biological insights in many experimental settings, as we describe in the results and discussion section.

RESULTS
finding differentially enriched motifs in paired chip-seq experiments
differential motif enrichment analysis can be used to analyze two chip-seq experiments for the same tf. one objective of such an analysis is to determine if the chip-ed tf changes co-factors between the two experiments. given two sets of chip-seq peak regions for tf x from experiments a and b, known motifs differentially enriched in set a relative to set bmay indicate that x is co-regulating some of its targets in conjunction with different tfs in the two experiments. hints as to the identities of the co-factors are provided by the annotation associated with the known, differentially enriched motifs.

one caveat to this type of analysis is that the observed differential enrichment of motifs may be an artifact of the relative efficiency of the two chip-seq experiments. for example, if experiment a was more successful than b at predicting the actual bound sites of tf x, the peak regions in set a may be more enriched for some co-factor motifs even though those motifs are not truly differentially enriched in the true populations of binding sites of tf x in the two experiments. it would therefore be incorrect to claim that enrichment of a motif in set a relative to set b was evidence of differential co-factor use. on the other hand, it would be valid to make this claim for motifs enriched in set b relative to set a.

fortunately, it is easy to determine which of two chip-seq experiments for a tf x was more successful using the enhanced centrimo algorithm. we simply run centrimo and look for differential enrichment of the known dna-binding motif for the chip-ed tf in set a relative to set b. if the known dna-binding motif for the chip-ed tf is significantly differentially enriched , it is unsafe to use set b as the control. conversely, if the fisher e-value of the known motif for tf x reported is much larger than  <dig>  it is safe to use set b as the control. this can be confirmed by running centrimo with the roles of sets a and b swapped.

we performed this analysis on the pairs of chip-seq experiments for tamoxifen-treated and etoh-treated  mcf10a-er-src . treatment of these cells with tamoxifen has been shown to lead to self-renewing mammospheres that contain cancer stem cells
 <cit> . in all these experimental pairs, it happens that the the known motif for the tf is significantly relatively enriched in the “untreated” cells. this is apparent from the highly significant fisher e-value when the peak regions for the untreated cells  are used as the “treatment” set in centrimo’s input. conversely, when the treated cell data  are given as the “treatment” set to centrimo, the fisher e-value is always its maximum possible value . the centrimo site probability curves for the known motif for three “a vs. b” cases from table
 <dig> are shown in figure
 <dig>  the results in table
 <dig> and figure
 <dig> make it clear that it is only safe to make inferences about differentially enriched motifs in the mcf10a-er-src chip-seq data if we use the untreated  cells as the control, not vice-versa. therefore, in what follows, we use centrimo only to look for known motifs that are relatively enriched in the centers of chip-seq peak regions from tamoxifen-treated cells compared with untreated cells.table  <dig>

the known motif for the chip-ed motif is more enriched in chip-seq peak regions from
untreated
mcf10a-er-src cells. the centrimo plots show the distribution of a known motif for the chip-ed tf in fos, myc and stat <dig> chip-seq peak regions . solid  curves show the positional distribution of the known motif in the tamoxifen-treated  cell chip-seq peak regions. tamoxifen treatment time is  <dig> hours except in the stat <dig> chip-seq experiment where it is  <dig> hours. jaspar motif names and ids and the p-value of the motif’s central enrichment in the treated cell peaks is shown in the legend of each plot.



for each of the three chip-ed factors—fos, myc and stat3—centrimo differential motif enrichment analysis identifies one or both of the other two factors as the most significantly enriched known motif after tamoxifen treatment . the effect sizes  for these six relative enrichments are large, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , showing that the enriched motifs for the secondary factors are at least 18% more likely to occur near the center of the chip-seq peak in the treated cells. for example, with tamoxifen treatment of  <dig> or  <dig> hours, the most relatively enriched motif in the fos chip-seq peaks is a stat motif, and vice-versa . a stat motif is also the most differentially enriched in the peaks from cells treated for  <dig> hours. in the myc chip-seq experiment, centrimo reports that the three most differentially enriched motifs in the treated cell peaks are fos and stat motifs . all these differential motif enrichments are highly significant statistically  and suggest that fos, myc and stat <dig> begin binding in close proximity to each other at many genomic loci in mcf10a-er-src cells after treatment with tamoxifen.table  <dig>

the table shows the ten most differentially enriched motifs in chip-seq peaks for the given chip-ed tf  in mcf10a-er-src cells treated with tamoxifen for the given time  compared with untreated cells. the name of the jaspar or jolma et al.
 <cit>  motif and its fisher e-value as computed by centrimo are given and each column in the table is sorted by e-value. significant  e-values are shown in bold font. all enriched motifs have odds ratios at least  <dig> .



this centrimo differential motif analysis also identifies motifs for several other tfs with known roles in mcf10a cells, suggesting that they may be bound by co-factors of fos, myc and stat <dig> . possible co-factors that become more active upon tamoxifen treatment include elk <dig>  atf <dig>  and nf- κb. elk <dig> is known to regulate mcf10a breast epithelial cell migration
 <cit> . the centrimo site distribution plot for the elk <dig> motif and the logos for it and the other similar motifs  are shown in figure
 <dig>  atf <dig> forms heterodimers with both fos and c-jun
 <cit> , two members of the various ap <dig> complexes whose roles in mcf10a cells are now being explored
 <cit> . the role of nf- κb in tamoxifen treated mcf10a-er-src cells is well established. nf- κb responds to the inflammatory response triggered by the transient presence of src and leads to activation of stat <dig>  as reported by the group which produced the chip-seq datasets we use in this analysis
 <cit> .figure  <dig> 
elk <dig> and other ets-factor motifs are relatively enriched in fos chip-seq peaks from tamoxifen treated mcf10a-er-src cells. panel a shows the central enrichment of the elk1_dbd motif  in the treated-cell  and untreated-cell  fos chip-seq peaks. treatment was for  <dig> hours. panel b shows the logos of the eight most differentially enriched ets-factor motifs.



perhaps the most interesting motifs are those that are enriched in chip-seq peaks from tamoxifen-treated cells but not enriched before treatment. we can easily restrict the analysis to such motifs using centrimo’s interactive html output, which allows filtering on various features including motif significance in either set of peaks. the nature of the association of binding by fos, myc, stat <dig> and nf- κb becomes clearer when we restrict the analysis to motifs that are not significantly enriched in un-treated mcf10a-er-src cells . in fos peaks, the relative enrichment of nf- κb motifs is not significant after four hours of tamoxifen treatment , but becomes highly significant  after  <dig> hours of treatment. this association between fos binding and nf- κb motifs then disappears after  <dig> hours of treatment. by contrast, nf- κb motifs are significantly differentially enriched in myc chip-seq peaks after only four hours of tamoxifen treatment, but they are never differentially enriched in stat <dig> peaks after treatment. the analysis presented in table
 <dig> also shows that ctcf motifs are differentially enriched in fos peaks at the same treatment time point  as nf- κb motifs, and not differentially enriched in peaks for the other two tfs . as in the previous analysis , centrimo specifically identifies differential enrichment of motifs in the families of stat <dig> and fos in each others bound regions after treatment, suggesting that they regulate an overlapping set of targets in tamoxifen treated mcf10a-er-src cells. the new analysis in table
 <dig> highlights the transient role of nf- κb in co-regulating the targets of fos and myc.table  <dig>

the benefit of differential motif enrichment analysis in paired chip-seq experiments
as we have seen, the most highly differentially enriched motifs in the paired chip-seq experiments are extremely relevant to the biology of mcf10a cells. however, if we look at the central enrichment of the fos-, myc-, stat- and nf- κb-family motifs in the tamoxifen-treated cells, rather than at their differential enrichment, they are not among the most highly enriched.  for example, in the fos chip-seq experiments, all myc, stat and nf- κb motifs rank far down the list of  <dig> known motifs in terms of central enrichment . although a stat-family motif  is the most differentially enriched motif , non-differential enrichment places all stat-family motifs at rank  <dig> or below in the three tamoxifen-treated fos chip-seq datasets . non-differential motif enrichment analysis thus does not make clear the important biological role of stat <dig> in tamoxifen-treated mcf10a-er-src cells. the same is true for the role of nf- κb, as motifs for nf- κb rank far down the list in the non-differential enrichment analysis of fos chip-seq peaks , whereas an nf- κb motif is ranked third and fourth in the differential motif enrichment analysis of cells treated with tamoxifen for  <dig> hr or  <dig> hr .table  <dig>

the table shows the name and rank  of the most significantly enriched motif from each of the four tf families in the peaks of the chip-ed tf  in mcf10a-er-src cells treated with tamoxifen for the given time . the top-ranking motif is also shown even if it is not from one of the four tf families. rank is based on the centrimo  central enrichment e-value.



the benefit of differential motif enrichment analysis is also seen in the myc and stat <dig> chip-seq experiments. differential analysis of paired myc chip-seq experiments places fos, stat and nf- κb at the top of the list of  <dig> known motifs , but non-differential analysis only highlights fos motifs . in the tamoxifen-treated cell myc chip-seq experiment, stat- and nf- κb-family motifs rank below  <dig> out of  <dig> motifs. in the case of the stat <dig> experiments, both differential and non-differential enrichment rank fos motifs near the top of the list , but differential analysis also ranks an nf- κb motif at position  <dig> in the  <dig> hr treated cells .

non-differential central motif enrichment analysis continues to be useful for studying the dna-binding affinity of the chip-ed tf. in all six tamoxifen-treated cell chip-seq experiments, a known motif from the chip-ed tf’s family ranks near the top of the list . in the three fos experiments and the myc experiment, the jdp2_full motif, which is highly similar to the fos motif, ranks first. in the case of the fos chip-seq peaks, this may indicate that the jdp2_full motif is may more faithfully represent the dna-binding affinity of fos than the jaspar fos motif does . it is more surprising that the jdp2_full motif is more significantly centrally enriched than any myc-family motif in the myc chip-seq peaks. however, the enrichment of the mycn motif in the myc peaks is actually more spatially confined . the regions of maximal central enrichment for the jdp2_full and mycn motifs are  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp wide respectively . thus, despite the lower p-value of the jdp2_full motif, the non-differential central motif enrichment analysis allows correct identification of the mycn motif as most similar to the primary dna-binding motif of the chip-ed tf, myc.figure  <dig>

differential local enrichment of motifs in bound and unbound promoters
centrimo can be used to perform local motif enrichment analysis in regions aligned at a genomic landmark such as the transcription start site  of each of a set of genes. other useful genomic landmarks such as translation start sites, intron-exon boundaries and polyadenylation sites can also be used to align genomic regions to be analyzed by centrimo. in addition, if two sets of regions are provided to centrimo, it can also be used to perform differential local motif enrichment analysis.

using the same chip-seq data from mcf10a-er-src as before, we performed differential local motif enrichment analysis comparing promoter regions near fos, myc or stat <dig> binding sites  with promoter regions distal from any binding site . to do this, for each chip-seq experiment we split the annotated human tsss  into two sets depending on whether they were within  <dig> bp of a declared chip-seq peak or not. we then created two input files containing the  <dig> bp regions centered on the tsss of these promoters and used them as input centrimo. we will refer to the first set as “fos-bound” promoters and the second as “fos-unbound” promoters, etc.

in untreated mcf10a-er-src cells the motifs for fos, myc and stat <dig> are not the most locally enriched motifs in the  <dig> bp regions centered on tsss near chip-seq peaks for the respective transcription factors . in terms of local enrichment, the highest rank for a motif from the chip-ed tf’s family is  <dig> .table  <dig>

local enrichment: proximal tsss

differential enrichment: proximal vs. distal tsss
the table summarizes local motif enrichment around tsss proximal  or distal to the nearest peak in fos, myc and stat <dig> chip-seq experiments in untreated mcf10a-er-src cells. for each chip-ed factor, we report the name  and rank  of the most significantly enriched motif from each of the three chip-ed tf families. in untreated mcf10a-er-src cells. rank is based on either the local enrichment in bound promoters  or the differential local enrichment between bound and unbound promoters . the top-ranking motif is also shown even if it is not from on of the three chip-ed tf families. the numbers of proximal  tsss are fos:  <dig> ; myc:  <dig> ; and stat3:  <dig> .



on the other hand, motifs from the chip-ed tfs family show strong differential local motif enrichment when comparing bound and unbound promoters. notably, a motif for stat <dig> ranks first in terms of differential local enrichment in bound vs. unbound promoter regions , compared with a best rank of  <dig> in terms of local motif enrichment in bound promoter regions. motifs from the fos and myc families also have significantly higher ranks  in promoters bound by fos and myc, respectively.

we note also that the motif for nf-ya  is highly differentially enriched enrichment in promoters bound by myc , but less so in promoters bound by fos . recent work in different cell lines  indicated an association between myc and nf-y at promoters, and a strong association between nf-y and fos at loci lacking the ap- <dig> motif
 <cit> .

selecting the individual motifs for display in the centrimo interactive report for fos bound/unbound promoters shows the jaspar ap <dig> motif is present in 34% of the bound promoters, and the jaspar nfya motif in 22%. choosing both motifs for display causes centrimo to report the intersection size as well—8%—which is barely above what would be expected by chance if the presence of the two motifs were uncorrelated .

thus, centrimo reveals that motifs for nf-y and ap- <dig> do not seem to be associated at fos-bound promoters in mcf10a-er-src cells, as was previously shown in other cell lines
 <cit> .

the centrimo analysis of the local differential motif enrichment in the fos chip-seq dataset is particularly interesting . the most differentially enriched motif in bound vs. unbound promoters is jdp2_dbd, a camp response-element  motif for the dna-binding domain  of the jun dimerization protein <dig> . this motif is essentially the same as that of other fos family members, the differential local enrichment of this motif is highly significant , but it is not locally enriched in the unbound promoters . however, jdp <dig> can also bind a tpa-response element , and this motif ranks third in terms of local enrichment , but is not significantly differentially enriched according to the centrimo analysis . as seen in the logos in figure
 <dig>  the tre and cre motifs differ only in the distance between the palindromic atga/tcat half-sites. the centrimo analysis thus reveals that all human promoters are locally enriched for tre motifs, but fos-bound promoters in mcf10a-er-src cells are relatively enriched for the closely related cre motif typical of fos binding in the  <dig> bp region upstream of the tss.figure  <dig> 
tre and cre motifs near promoters bound by fos in

mcf10a-er-src cells. the centrimo plots show the distribution of a known motif for the chip-ed tf around tsss that are near  a fos chip-seq peaks  or more distal . the plots are centered on the tss. panel a shows the motif  with most significant differential local enrichment ; panel b shows the third most locally enriched motif  around fos-bound promoters , among the top twelve motifs are seven motifs similar to the fos-family consensus , including the first five motifs. a search of the literature reveals that three of the five remaining motifs belong to proteins with possible links to breast cancer: include srebf1_dbd, arnt and dbp_full. srebp <dig> , also known as srebf <dig>  may be involved in breast cancer stem-like cell survival
 <cit> , as was shown using mcf10a and mcf10at cells
 <cit> . lipogenesis, of which srebp <dig> is a master regulator, may play a critical role in early breast carcinogenesis, and increased expression of lipogenic enzymes seems to correlate with increased risk of development of breast cancer
 <cit> . arnt has been shown to have a role in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer
 <cit> . a role in the regulation of brca <dig> has been demonstrated for dbp 
 <cit> . we did not find any known link to breast cancer for the remaining two motifs, atf4_dbd and bhlhb2_dbd. the high proportion of biologically interesting motifs among the most significant differentially enriched motifs in fos-bound promoters demonstrates the potential value of this use of centrimo.figure  <dig> 
local differential enrichment of motifs in fos-bound vs. unbound promoters. a  screenshot of the centrimo interactive output using fos-bound and unbound promoters shows the twelve most locally differentially enriched motifs in the jaspar+jolma compendium. for each motif, the table shows its id and name in the compendium, the local enrichment in the bound promoters , the differential enrichment  in the bound vs. unbound promoters, the  significance of the local enrichment in the bound promoters , the  significance of the local enrichment in the unbound promoters , and the coordinates of the region of maximum enrichment in the bound promoters .



CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that differential local motif enrichment analysis can yield insights beyond those available from motif analysis of a single dataset. using this new feature of the centrimo algorithm, we showed that the differential analysis of chip-seq peaks for a single transcription factor under two different cellular conditions identifies several other transcription factors with pivotal roles in the distinguishing the two cellular states. in particular, centrimo differential analysis of chip-seq of just fos in transformed and untransformed mcf10a-er-src cells ranks motifs from the stat and nf- κb families first and second in terms of statistical significance , whereas non-differential analysis ranks them  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> motifs . given that stat <dig> and nf- κb have been shown to be the key transcription factors in the positive feedback loop that maintains the transformed state of mcf10a-er-src after removal of the tamoxifen stimulus
 <cit> , this result shows the potential of differential local motif analysis of paired chip-seq experiments to identify important candidate transcription factors for further investigation.

we have also demonstrated the utility of differential local motif analysis is also useful for analyzing signals near genomic landmarks such as tsss. one such application is the comparative motif analysis of promoters bound our unbound by a particular transcription factor. using some of the same chip-seq data for fos as above, centrimo differential local motif analysis revealed the a probable association between binding of fos and a myc family member, most likely myc at promoters in mcf10a-er-src cells. the same analysis also highlighted the widespread presence of tre motifs in human promoters and the lack of the related  cre motif in promoters not bound by fos in mcf10a-er-src cells.

one can imagine many other scenarios where differential motif analysis would be useful. we studied paired chip-seq experiments before and after a treatment. the same types of analysis could be applied to pairs of chip-seq experiments from different cell or tissue types, or from the same tissue at different developmental stages. centrimo could also be used with rna-binding protein  motifs to study paired clip-seq  datasets. the centrimo website currently provides one large compendium of rbp motifs
 <cit>  and users can also upload their own sets of motifs. our local motif enrichment analysis focused on promoters near to or distal from chip-seq peaks, but one could also examine sets of promoters grouped using other criteria . in short, differential motif analysis can be applied whenever paired sets of genomic regions or rna molecules may harbor encoded signals, regulatory or otherwise.

a single centrimo differential motif enrichment analysis can be used in many different ways. the centrimo report is highly interactive and allows the user to sort the results by non-differential enrichment, differential enrichment, position of enrichment, number of motif matches, and many other criteria. the user can also filter the results by non-differential or differential enrichment significance, the size of the enriched region or enrichment in the control dataset. the user also has full control over what information to display via check boxes on the report. the positional distribution of motif matches of user-chosen motifs is plotted and can be panned and zoomed interactively, and the plot can be in terms of either match position or distance from the sequence center. the centrimo report also provides for creation of publication quality figures from the distribution plots.

the value of all forms of motif enrichment analysis, including the differential local analysis presented here, depends to a large extent on the availability of high-quality, annotated motif databases. fortunately a large and growing number of such databases are now available for both transcription factors and rna-binding proteins. these databases, which are made available for use with centrimo via its website, are based on a number of technologies including chip-seq, high-throughput selex, and protein binding microarrays. the complementary strengths and weaknesses of these different experimental technologies makes it advisable to repeat motif enrichment analyses using motif databases based on different technologies.

among the databases made available by the centrimo website are dna-binding motif databases, including comprehensive databases of vertebrate motifs, specialized databases for particular organisms, and rna-binding motif databases. for vertebrate chip-seq data, the comprehensive databases  will be the most useful since they contain the largest spectrum of known motifs. for data from non-vertebrate organisms, using the most relevant jaspar specialized database  fungi”) may be appropriate. users may also input custom databases of motifs.
