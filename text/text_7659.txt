BACKGROUND
there are more than  <dig> dog breeds, each maintained as a breeding population separate from other breeds, which are collectively afflicted by more than  <dig> reported genetic diseases, the incidence of which varies from breed to breed  <cit> . many of the breeds have been founded from a small number of individuals, and the dogs within them have been subjected to a high degree of inbreeding. in some cases further population bottlenecks and/or popular sire effects have led to a small number of individuals contributing disproportionately to the gene pool of the breed. in small, inbred and genetically isolated populations, inherited diseases are likely to be genetically homogeneous, with the same identical-by-descent mutation underlying all instances of the disease in the breed. even if there is genetic heterogeneity, one of the mutations may be much more common than the rest due to the aforementioned characteristics of dog breeds. association studies and, specifically for recessive diseases, autozygosity mapping  <cit> , are well suited for mapping disease loci in this kind of populations. moreover, these approaches have the advantage of not needing dna samples from members of nuclear families covering several generations, a requirement that may be difficult to meet for late age of onset diseases since by the time a dog is diagnosed as affected, the parents may no longer be alive or sibs and descendants may have been dispersed. in place of nuclear families, association studies may use any affected dogs and unrelated controls. thus, this approach has the potential for increasing the number of disease loci that may be mapped in this species.

among canine diseases, progressive retinal atrophy  involves the gradual death of photoreceptors, first rods, leading to night blindness, and then cones, causing complete loss of sight. pra has been reported in more than a hundred breeds, and the mutations underlying it have been intensively searched for in many of them, although only few of the mutations have been found  <cit> . two different mutations have been identified in pde6b, one causing rod-cone dysplasia type  <dig>  in irish setters  <cit>  and another involved in pra in sloughis  <cit> . mutations have also been found in pdc in the miniature schnauzer  <cit> , rpe <dig> in briards with retinal dystrophy  <cit> , pde6a in cardigan welsh corgis with rod-cone dysplasia type  <dig>   <cit> , rho in english and bull mastiffs with autosomal dominant pra  <cit> , and rpgr in samoyeds and siberian huskies with x-linked pra  <cit> . in addition to this,  <dig> loci have been mapped: early retinal degeneration  in the norwegian elkhound  <cit>  to cfa <dig>  rod cone dysplasia type  <dig>  in the collie  <cit>  to cfa <dig>  and progressive rod-cone degeneration  in cfa <dig>  this last one is the most widespread of these diseases since it occurs in the american and english cocker spaniels, labrador retriever and miniature poodle  <cit> . crossing experiments involving affected miniature poodles and english and american cocker spaniels showed that prcd is allelic in these breeds  <cit> . the mapping of the pra locus in the american eskimo dog suggests the disease in this breed is also prcd  <cit> . most recently a mutation has been described in a new gene prcd which is believed to be causal for this disease  <cit> .

the finnish lapphund has a long history, descending from scandinavian spitz type dogs. for a long time it has been a working dog, although its role as a family dog is growing, as its popularity increases, particularly in finland. the breed standard was first established in  <dig>  and has been revised several times. dogs from unregistered parents may still be admitted to the breed if they meet the breed's standard. a number of pra cases have been found in the breed, but no clinical or genetic studies have been performed so we decided to investigate its cause using genomic mapping techniques.

RESULTS
progressive retinal atrophy in the finnish lapphund
affected finnish lapphunds have been reported in finland and in the uk; the prevalence of the disease is unknown. by ophthalmoscopic examination it was seen that the early signs of the disease include subtle retinal vascular attenuation, tapetal hyperreflectivity and pale grey optic discs. as the disease progressed tapetal hyperreflectivity and vascular attenuation became more obvious. in some cases there was non-tapetal pigment migration. in dogs ophthalmoscopically examined regularly from birth, the first signs of the disease were noticed at the age of  <dig> to  <dig> years, placing it within the late onset group of pra diseases.

to date, no multigenerational families have been followed to determine the mode of inheritance of the disease in the finnish lapphund; however, the distribution of known cases within the breed does not support autosomal dominant or x-linked inheritance .

pedigree analysis of  <dig> affected individuals revealed that  <dig> of them share as a common ancestor one of the founders of the registered breed. that this ancestor is a founder of the registered breed and is itself an obligate carrier suggests that the mutation antedates the registered breed.

dna pools and pedigree analysis of the cases
autozygosity mapping, by dna pooling was used as the initial step to map the finnish lapphund pra locus. to test the suitability of the dna pooling approach, and to ensure that rare alleles would be detected, thus avoiding false negative results, dna from two individuals were mixed in different proportions raging from 1: <dig> to 1: <dig>  these two individuals were heterozygous for the fh <dig> marker, having only one allele in common. all three alleles were detected when the dna were mixed, irrespective of the ratio between the two dnas. next, two dna pools were made, one with dna from  <dig> finnish lapphund cases, and the other with dna from  <dig> obligate carriers . the pedigree of the dogs in the case pool was analysed using pedhunter  <cit>  in search of a possible common ancestor. such a dog was identified as one of the male founders of the registered breed. the number of meioses between the cases and the common ancestor ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the shortest region of identity by descent  <cit>  was estimated to span  <dig>  cm and corresponded to the affected dog furthest removed  from the common ancestor.

locus mapping
to map the locus,  <dig> microsatellite markers were studied. seventeen of these were chosen for their proximity to  <dig> loci known to be involved in dog or human retinal diseases, or being expressed in the retina: abca <dig>  cnga <dig>  gnat <dig>  gngt <dig>  nrl, pdc, pde6a, pde6d, pdeg, prcd, rds, rlbp <dig>  rom <dig> and sag. the rest of the markers were selected to cover the whole of the autosomes at intervals of approximately  <dig> cm. for  <dig> markers  similar levels of heterozygosity were observed in both pools;  <dig> markers  were uninformative, and  <dig> markers  exhibited a shift towards homozygosity in the case pool: fh <dig> , fh <dig>  and galk <dig> .

individual genotyping was performed with the  <dig> markers exhibiting the shift, using the same  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls used in the dna pools. only for galk <dig> was the shift towards homozygosity confirmed, with  <dig> cases homozygous for the same allele, and the remaining one heterozygous. in contrast to this, half of the controls were heterozygous , and the rest were homozygous for the same allele as the cases. the clump test  <cit>  gave some support to the association between galk <dig> and the locus for the disease in this small set of samples .

to characterise in more detail the region close to galk <dig>  additional markers were added and tested with the dna pools. the markers and their position in the dog genome  <cit>   were: tk <dig> , fh <dig> , c <dig> , fh <dig> , ren198p <dig> , fh <dig> , and c <dig>  . however, no differences in the level of heterozygosity were observed between the pools and no homozygosity was observed among the cases.

galk <dig> individual genotyping
next,  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls were added to the previous set, and all  <dig> samples were tested for the galk <dig> marker using a fluorescent-labelled primer . the allele frequencies among cases and controls were significantly different . t <dig> assumes association of the mutation with a single allele and the lod approaches  <dig> 

galk <dig> analysis in swedish lapphunds and lapponian herders
a small number of retinal atrophy cases have also been reported for the swedish lapphund, which is a breed closely related to the finnish lapphund, so a group of  <dig> samples was assembled. the  <dig> cases belonged to a nuclear family . among the controls,  <dig> belonged to a different nuclear family , while a fourth control belonged to a separate family.

all  <dig> cases in the swedish lapphund were homozygous for the same galk <dig> microsatellite allele  as affected finnish lapphunds, while all controls were heterozygous and all of them carried one copy of allele d.

the lapponian herder is a breed closely related to the two previous ones and a few retinal atrophy cases have also been reported. clinically, the disease appears to be similar to the one observed in the finnish lapphund.

samples from  <dig> lapponian herder cases and  <dig> controls  were obtained. the  <dig> cases from finland were diagnosed at  <dig> years  <dig> months and  <dig> years  <dig> month. the third case, from norway, was diagnosed at  <dig> years  <dig> months. all  <dig> cases were heterozygous for the galk <dig> marker, and only one of the  <dig> alleles in this group corresponded to allele d, the one present in homozygous state among the cases in the other two breeds. in the controls, only an obligate carrier dam had one copy of allele d but it was not transmitted to a descendant case.

discussion
we have used dna pooling  <cit> , a particular form of autozygosity mapping, to map the pra locus in the finnish lapphund, using a low marker density and a small initial set of cases and controls. the results suggest that the pra disease in the finnish lapphund may be prcd. the study that mapped the prcd locus established its location in the centromeric region of chromosome  <dig> and all cases in that study had the same homozygous genotype for the galk <dig> microsatellite  <cit> . homozygosity mapping of the pra locus in the american eskimo dog also showed that all affected dogs were homozygous for the galk <dig> marker, while six different alleles were seen among the controls  <cit> . as in other breeds with prcd, the disease in the finnish lapphund is a late-onset retinal degeneration with signs progressing from mild to severe. however, no electroretinogram or ultrastructural studies have been performed in this breed.

the initial results with pooled dna showed a reduction in heterozygosity for the galk <dig> marker in the cases, when compared to the controls. individual genotyping of the individuals represented in the dna pools confirmed the homozygosity for all the cases, except one, while among the controls heterozygous genotypes were observed, as expected from obligate carriers, plus some homozygous individuals. the single heterozygous genotype observed among the cases in the dna pooling stage may be due to a recombination event. alternatively, it may represent a phenocopy, having a retinal disease different from that in the rest of the cases. if this case has the same disease as the rest of affected finnish lapphunds, excluding the galk <dig> region on the basis of this single heterozygote may lead to a false negative result. a certain number of non-homozygous cases are expected in the region harbouring the disease locus, due to recombination events  <cit> . the proportion of these individuals depends both on the number of meioses between the origin of the mutation and the cases being examined, and on the average spacing between the markers used  <cit> . the clump tests applied to the individual genotyping results of these  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls resulted in significant differences for tests t <dig> and t <dig>  tests t <dig> and t <dig> were non-significant. this differences in the level of significance are the result of the different ways in which the tests handle the alleles, starting from the same contingency test. the levels of significance would also have been influenced by the small number of samples used  and by the fact that the controls were all obligate carriers, meaning that allele differences between the two sets would be smaller than that if non-related controls had been used. at least half of the alleles in the initial controls were expected to be shared with the cases and, as mentioned before, some controls had the same genotype as the cases. taking all of this into account, it was considered that pra locus for this breed could be close to the galk <dig> marker. when additional samples were tested, all four tests were significant, with t <dig> and t <dig> again showing the highest values.

other markers on chromosome  <dig> did not show a shift towards homozygosity in the dna pools. given that the results for the galk <dig> marker were significant, and that no other markers showed a shift towards homozygosity that could be corroborated with individual genotyping, it is considered unlikely that the galk <dig> region may represent a false positive.

the individual genotyping of a larger set of finnish lapphunds resulted in three cases, out of a total of  <dig>  heterozygous for the galk <dig> microsatellite. two of them  had one copy of allele d, which was homozygous for the other cases, while this allele was absent from the other case . in the third case, which does not share any allele with the rest of the cases, recombination events may have occurred in the lineage leading to it. alternatively, this individual may have a different retinal disease. this dog was diagnosed at the age of  <dig> years  <dig> months and its characteristics were similar to those of other cases in this breed: slight hyper reflectivity, thin veins and pale grey optic nerve head. the dog was examined three times  before the first signs of disease appeared. the last examination was done at  <dig> years and  <dig> months. there was very little or no progression and no pigment migration. it is possible that a different retinal disease is present in this individual. finding the pra mutation in the finnish lapphund may help to solve this case.

some of the individuals used as controls were very young so it is possible that some may develop the disease in the future, as they grow older. according to the results of the galk <dig> microsatellite, some of them share the same genotype as the cases. in association studies, as in any other mapping approach, phenotypes of cases and controls should be correctly assigned. however, this may be difficult sometimes. for example, in late-onset diseases there is the risk of including as controls some individuals which may not have yet developed the disease. nevertheless, even when a small number of individuals are incorrectly assigned to one set or another, it may still be possible to map the disease locus  <cit> , although with some loss of power. in this context, it has been suggested that unscreened individuals, being plentiful and easy to obtain, may be used as controls, in situations where screening them is difficult or impossible, as long as enough controls are included in the study to compensate for the loss of power derived from the inclusion of some cases among the controls  <cit> .

in the swedish lapphund and the lapponian herder, which are breeds closely related to the finnish lapphund, some pra cases have also been reported. this suggests they may all have the same type of pra. for the galk <dig> microsatellite, the genotype of affected swedish lapphunds was the same as in finnish lapphunds. however, for the lapponian herder only one of the three cases had the same allele as the one present in the pra cases of the other  <dig> breeds. this could imply that there have been recombination events between galk <dig> and the pra locus in this breed, or that the retinal disease is a different one. studying a larger set of individuals, or identifying the mutation in the other  <dig> breeds, may help solve this problem.

CONCLUSIONS
association studies, including autozygosity mapping may be a practical way of mapping genes underlying canine diseases, using dogs from the pet population, since this approach exploits the particular characteristics of dog breed populations. the pra locus in the finnish lapphund was mapped to the centromeric region of choromosome  <dig>  which harbours the prcd locus. if the gene underlying the disease in the scandinavian breeds is confirmed to be the same as that causing prcd, this would add  <dig> more breeds to those already known to have this form of pra.
