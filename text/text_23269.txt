BACKGROUND
moniliophthora perniciosa  aime and phillip-mora   <cit>  is a hemibiotrophic basidiomycete that causes witches' broom disease  in cocoa . currently, wbd occurs in south and central america and can cause crop losses of up to 90%  <cit> . in bahia , m. perniciosa was identified in  <dig>  <cit>  and, as a consequence of its spreading, the annual production of cocoa beans dropped from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tons within  <dig> years, reducing export values from an all-time high of about us$  <dig> billion to  <dig> million. during this period nearly  <dig>  rural workers lost their jobs, resulting in an intensive migration from farms to urban areas  <cit> .

the fungus infects young meristematic tissues inducing hypertrophy and hyperplasia, loss of apical dominance, and proliferation of axillary shoots. the hypertrophic growth of the infected vegetative meristems  is the most characteristic symptom of wbd  <cit> . basidiomata, in which basidiospores are produced, develop on dead but attached dry brooms of cacao trees in the field, after dry and wet periods. basidiospores are spread by wind and depend on sufficient moisture for survival. they can only germinate on and infect susceptible cacao tissues  if relative humidity levels are near 100%. shortly after infection the pathogen establishes a biotrophic relationship with the host during which the fungus has an intercellular, biotrophic, monokaryotic growth phase, without clamp connections. four to six weeks later, the hyphae become dikaryotic, develop clamp connections and the fungus grows saprophytically  <cit> . a well-characterized concerted series of cell death events  <cit>  causes the green broom to become necrotic, and basidiomata are formed in a favorable environment after  <dig> weeks or more  <cit> .

information about morphological development and environment that affect basidiomata and basidiospore production of m. perniciosa are important to improve the in vitro culture of the pathogen and to study its life cycle. environmental conditions for basidiomata production have been described by suarez  <cit> , rocha  <cit>  and rocha and wheeler  <cit> . an artificial production of basidiomata has been studied by several authors, but an ideal production mode has not yet been achieved. stahel  <cit>  observed basidiomata development on mycelial mats in agar cultures. purdy et al.  <cit>  and purdy and dickstein  <cit>  modified stahel's methods to produce basidiomata on mycelial mats. griffith and hedger  <cit>  improved basidiomata production by using bran-vermiculite medium, a method currently used to produce m. perniciosa basidiospores. later, niella et al.  <cit>  modified medium formulation and macagnan et al.  <cit>  removed vermiculite and the extra layer of cacao powder and caso <dig> originally used to cover the medium and to reduce the time to fruiting. the difficulty of obtaining axenic cultures and the long cultivation time has hindered more detailed studies on the morphology and early development of m. perniciosa basidiomata.

several studies of basidiomata development in other basidiomycetes, e.g., agaricus bisporus, flammulina velutipes, boletus edulis  <cit>  as well as mycorrhizal fungi such as laccaria sp.  <cit>  have already been published, complementing research on coprinopsis cinerea and schizophyllum commune, which are models for developmental studies in macroscopic basidiomycota  <cit> . basidiomata of m. perniciosa produced either in nature  <cit>  or under laboratory conditions  <cit>  have been studied and their morphology was originally described by stahel  <cit> . later, delgado and cook  <cit>  showed that the hyphae found in basidiomata are dikaryotic whereas basidia are monokaryotic .

although the microscopic characteristics and growth patterns of both monokaryotic and dikaryotic mycelia have been described elsewhere  <cit> , there is no microscopic characterization of the pattern of basidiomata development. we provide the first description of primordium development of m. perniciosa basidiomata. based on our observations the development was divided in four stages, similar to those described for a. bisporus . together with the sequencing and annotation of the m. perniciosa genome  <cit> , detailed morphologic information is important for future research into m. perniciosa mutants, complementing genetic studies. here we describe and histologically compare the development of both in vivo and in vitro-grown m. perniciosa basidiomata and analyze the expression of  <dig> selected ests by macroarray and of  <dig> ests by rt-qpcr.

RESULTS
morphological observations
observations of dead brooms kept in humid chambers or collected directly from the field showed the presence of a thin mat of saprophytic mycelium on the surface of the brooms. it was possible to notice color changes and the morphology that preceded basidiomata formation on this mat. the aerial mycelium formed a thick layer with notable color modifications: it was initially white , then yellow  and later, reddish pink . at a later stage, dark-brown to reddish spots appeared until onset of primordium growth . the same characteristics were observed in artificial cultivation , which allowed a monitoring of the morphogenetic stages of m. perniciosa basidiomata.

currently two media are used to produce basidiomata of m. perniciosa. the "griffith medium"  <cit>  contains pieces of bran/vermiculite covered with a casing layer of peat/gypsum, while the "macagnan medium"  <cit>  contains dry broom material. when plugs of dikaryotic mycelia are transferred from agar culture to either of these two solid media and incubated at 25°c in petri dishes, a network of hyphae initiates growth within and on the surface of the solid particles. once the medium is well-colonized , basidiomata production is induced by opening the dishes, suspending the block of substrate , and subjecting it to a regime of intermittent watering and a daily photoperiod of 10– <dig> h light.

when cultured in the "griffith medium", mycelial mats of m. perniciosa isolate cp <dig>  turned light-yellow four days after exposure to air and water, changing to reddish-pink after a further ten days, finally becoming dark-reddish pink until the onset of basidiomata development, some two to eight weeks later. these color changes were not uniform among parts of mycelial mats, varying according to irrigation intensity. the whitish aerial mycelium remained visible until the end of cultivation on some parts of the mycelial mats. color changes also occurred in long-term stored mycelia at 25°c, however, basidiomata formation was never observed. since mycelium color change was a pre-requisite for primordium formation, we standardized the collections according to their color.

in an examination of the mycelial mats during the 32-day incubation period in petri dishes, prior to incubation in the wetting/drying chambers, branched and agglomerated hyphae  were observed fanning out on the surface of the substrate, appearing as long strands , with probable hyphal fusion along part of their length . at some points, hyphae were covered in a thin amorphous layer, apparently composed of plant cell wall material , as well as irregularly swollen and ornamented cells . after exposure to water and air in the wetting/drying chamber, there appeared to be further agglomeration of hyphae into thicker structures, often covered with a layer of amorphous material  and some raised areas with curved hyphae were also observed . these changes were concurrent with the formation of yellow, reddish pink and dark-reddish pink pigmentation on the mat surfaces. in contrast, the mycelium on dry brooms already formed a dense layer at the white stage, probably due to the fact that this layer is formed in response to regular irrigation to which the brooms were subjected from the beginning of the experiment .

curved hyphae, leading to a possible hyphal fusion, were observed at this moment and in all distinct stages of the superficial mycelium, a pattern also observed in laccaria spp  <cit> . side-by-side hyphal branches evolved to larger plate-like structures in reddish pink mycelium  and in mycelium forming the primordia apex . these plate structures were not always continuous and some mycelial strands appeared empty or dry . a microscopic tissue section of reddish-pink mycelium in air contact revealed a distinctive mycelium layer with a mean thickness of  <dig> μm , as well as internal net patterns of hyphae.

similar patterns of hyphal growth were reported by heckman et al.  <cit>  in a. bisporus before basidiomata formation  <cit> . these authors recognized four morphological stages of mycelium and observed side-by-side hyphal fusions and the formation of hyphal wall ornamentation, which occurred in the first mycelial growth phase  <cit> . in the second stage, hyphal fusion led to the formation of structures called strands. microscopic primordia were formed in the third stage in more compact masses, in areas of dense mycelial growth. at the fourth stage, primordia were visible to the unaided eye. fused and ornamented hyphae as well as strands appeared in m. perniciosa before primordium development. therefore, the process of primordium development of m. perniciosa was similar to that observed for a. bisporus, exept for the formation of an impermeable surface layer in hyphae and the type of hyphal ornamentation only observable in m. perniciosa.

the chemical composition of the impermeable surface layer was investigated. no reduced sugars, lipids and phenols were detected . if these layers consisted of empty fused hyphae, chitinases were possibly active in this event. lopes  <cit>  observed an increased expression of chitinases in m. perniciosa in the reddish pink mycelium prior to basidiomata formation. it may also be possible that these areas are rich in hydrophobins, a protein required in basidiomata formation in several other fungi that form a thin outer layer on hyphae exposed to the air  <cit> . these proteins form an amphipathic layer between hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces, which protects the hyphae-inducing aerial mycelia  <cit> . an increased expression of hydrophobin-encoding genes was observed during mycelial mat growth of m. perniciosa  <cit> .

changes in pigmentation of the superficial mycelium of m. perniciosa were described by purdy et al.  <cit>  and by griffith and hedger  <cit> . in our experiments, changes in pigmentation were observed in mycelial mats washed in chambers until basidiomata emergence, indicating a correlation with basidiomata formation. the same color of the surface mycelium persists in the primordia, especially in the apices. the appearance of hyphal nodules coincided with the change in pigmentation from yellow to pink of the surface mycelium as described before , and the primordia emerged after this color had darkened. stronger pigmentation was observed on the primordia apex exactly at points of densely aggregated hyphae, which leads us to believe that pigmentation is correlated with hyphal aggregation. the term "hyphal nodules" has been used to describe the initial phases of basidiomata development  <cit>  as well as for the nodules in the regions of the "initials" and in the morphogenesis-directing primordia  <cit> .

primordia of m. perniciosa appeared when the dense mycelial mat showed reddish-pink pigmentation. the first signal of primordial development was probably the appearance of primary hyphal nodules as well as internal local aggregations on dark pink-reddish mycelium . thereafter, hyphal interaction led to the formation of compact aggregates that can be considered an undifferentiated stage called initial primordium or secondary hyphal nodule  <cit>  . hyphae belonging to such aggregates were short, large and strongly stainable with fuchsin acid, a substance present in pianeze iii solution, used to distinguish fungal from plant tissues . the primordium emerged from within the surface mycelial layer  as a well-defined protuberance  with hyphae similar to those found in the aggregates . the primordium initial  then underwent differentiation to form stipe, pileus  and lamellae . hyphae of the primordium apex were cylindrical, with round apices and parallel growth, bending at the end distal to the pileus . stipe hyphae were more compact, flat, growing vertically . amorphous material and clamped hyphae were also present on the apical primordium surface .

the various developmental stages of m. perniciosa basidiomata formation were very similar to those previously described in detail for agaricus sp.  <cit> , c. cinerea  <cit> , mycena stylobates  <cit>  and laccaria spp.  <cit> . differentiation in agaricus occurred at the initial stage to produce a bipolar fruiting body primordium  <cit> . this process appears to be conserved among agaricales with slight differences between species. it was rather difficult to microscopically observe the hyphal nodule of the mycelial mats grown on "griffith medium" due to the density of the hyphal layer. however, the primary hyphal nodule stages of m. perniciosa basidiomata were inferred from the presence of areas of intense localized ramifying hyphal aggregates in small nodules . these nodules progressed to a globose aggregate, surrounded by a dense layer of amorphous material, an irregular arrangement of interwoven hyphae on the internal tissue of dry brooms stained green , which can be considered the initial stage of hyphal aggregation. this hyphal agglomerate is distinguished by acid fuchsin which stains only living tissues  <cit> . aggregates found in dark reddish-pink mycelium  indicated a competent mycelium from which primordia may originate, similar to the aggregates in laccaria sp., which would give rise to basidiomata  <cit> .

globose aggregates appeared on the surface with a protective layer covering a hyphal bulb . walther et al.  <cit>  described a similar phenomenon in the initial development of m. stylobates. the initial formation of this layer can be observed in m. perniciosa  that later covered the surface of the protuberant area . then, an initial emerged  and differentiated into a primordium, here referred to as the third stage . it is likely that enzymatic digestion by chitinases  <cit>  occurred in the hyphae of the outer layer, thereby allowing the "initial" to emerge as a dense layer, with amorphous material in the center of the protuberance. differentiation continued leading to the formation of the lamellae  and later the pileus . the apical region of initials formed the pileus and the basal region formed the stipe . at the end of this stage the immature pileus and stipe  could be seen with lamellae already established . lamellae expanded after two to three days , depending on sufficiently high moisture levels, as already observed for other basidiomycetes  <cit> . the hymenium was enclosed by incurved margins of the pileus, only being exposed when the basidiomata maturated . finally the stipe elongated and the pileus expanded to expose the hymenium for basidiospore liberation . basidiomata maturation was regulated by humidity and not all initial primordia progressed to form basidiomata .

primordia emerged from  <dig> d after the exposure of substrate-grown mycelia to water and light in the humid chamber . the first basidiomata were observed about  <dig> d after the first primordium was visible, but undifferentiated primordia were still present on the mat surface when basidiomata appeared. density of primordia was high, their size not uniform and their production discontinuous, suggesting a programmed induction, as in plant inflorescences. the morphogenesis observed in the initials  resembled that of other basidiomycota. hyphae aggregated towards the surface and assumed a vertical position concurrent with an increase in diameter and compartment length  . these hyphae differentiated to form an agglomerate  where they converged in an apical group  and two lateral groups, growing in towards the bottom . a parallel bundle of hyphae with an inclination in direction to the center of the agglomerate was also observed . this bundle diminished in length when the central aggregates increased in size; later, a lateral appendix to the primordium was observed . lateral groups  increased in prominence during development, and the convergent hyphae at the agglomerate apex became vertically prominent .

the lateral groups tended to bend downwards away from the apex . a group of basal hyphae, however, bent upwards, supporting the hyphal extremity that bent downwards . as the lateral hyphae expanded, the overlapping of these hyphae diminished , increasing the space between these hyphal groups . a micrograph of an emerged primordium  shows a difference in opacity between hyphae, suggesting that a partial digestion led to the spaces between the lamellae. another freehand section shows the lateral bending of hyphae and the differentiation of the stipe . this primordium already possessed a differentiated hymenium .

studies in agaricus sp. and other edible fungi revealed a hemi-angiocarpous standard developmental stage  <cit> , with a veil covering the primordium. in these fungi, a cluster of parallel and oriented hyphae emerges and forms the stipe and the pileus develops from the apical region. laccaria sp. has a plectenchymal tissue from which the stipe originates, whilst the pileus arises from an apical prosenchymal tissue, as in agaricus  <cit> . similar structures were observed in m. perniciosa . however, the development was pseudo-angiocarpous since the hymenium was protected by the immature pileus, and no inner veil was present   <cit> . the morphogenetic mechanism was classified as concentrated, based on the description of reijnders  <cit>  since defined globose primordia with a complex anatomy  were formed. this is compatible with pileostiptocarpic development because stipe and pileus-originated elements were already present in the primordia at an early stage .

genes related to the early development of m. perniciosa basidiomata
the molecular basis of cell differentiation that precedes basidiomata formation was recently investigated  <cit> . developmentally regulated genes have been identified for some basidiomycetes such as a. bisporus  <cit> , c. cinerea  <cit> , pleurotus ostreatus  <cit> , among others. moreover, the rapid increase of fully or partially sequenced genomes and ests from fungi already available in databanks allow the in silico identification of genes possibly involved in these processes  <cit> . however, the understanding of the direct association between these identified genes and their function in the initial development of basidiomata is still incipient. for example, the study of the ests of p. ostreatus led to the identification of pleurotolysins expressed specifically in the primordial stage. the function of these proteins is being studied, but their role in primordia formation is not yet elucidated  <cit> .

since the studies in m. perniciosa are also in an early stage, the identification of genes related to basidiomata development was a first step to establish a possible correlation between the developmental stages and their expression. the description of morphological changes in mycelium prior to the development of reproductive structures is a key step for subsequent morphogenetic studies and, at this point, helped in the search for genes related to these processes. so far, our contribution has been the analysis of the abundance of transcripts for some selected genes in specific moments during induction of fungal fruiting. two independent but related tests were carried out. using  <dig> genes from a library derived from mycelium in the fructification stage, a reverse northern analysis, also known as macro array was performed, contrasting the early culturing with the final stage, when the first basidiomata appear. additionally, a rt-qpcr was performed for  <dig> genes, analyzing their expression in each of the stages described in the above-described morphological studies.

the development of basidiomycetes such as c. cinerea, one of the best-studied to date  <cit> , served as guideline underlying the choice of the genes. in the case of these fungi, fructification seems to occur in genetically pre-conditioned mycelium and in response to nutrient deficiency, as well as to stimuli such as alternating light/dark, humidity and co <dig> concentration  <cit> . based on these studies, genes were selected and identified in the available library.

expression profiles of genes involved in basidiomata development by macroarray
a macroarray analysis was performed with  <dig> genes encoding putative proteins involved in fruiting, to detect differences in their expression profile between mycelia in white and primordial phases, which would allow their identification as induced or repressed at these two contrasting developmental stages . ests were obtained from a full-length cdna library, previously constructed from mycelia, primordia and mature basidiomata collected during fructification  and selected based on their similarity with known conserved genes. the complete list of the selected genes is shown in table s <dig>  as well as the fold change values obtained by comparing the results of each spot in the 'white' and ' primordia ' stages. a classification based on the likely functions of these gene products was performed as described by gesteira et al.  <cit> , to deepen the understanding of the participation of these genes in the fructification process of m. perniciosa. the table s <dig>  shows also some genes for which the increase of transcripts in the primordial stage compared to the white phase was significant by the student's t test of means.

the macroarray analyses give us an overview of gene activity during fruiting in m. perniciosa. we discriminated  <dig> genes in two expression patterns: group i, containing up-regulated genes in the white mycelium phase and group ii, containing up-regulated genes in the primordia mycelium phase . some genes are noteworthy because previous descriptions report their participation in the fruiting process of other fungi. in this trial, hydrophobins were represented by four clones and three of them showed increased expression during the primordial stage.

hydrophobins are cysteine-rich proteins specific for filamentous fungi, capable of generating amphipathic films on the surface of an object  <cit> . they are related to a broad range of growth and development processes, among them the formation of aerial structures  <cit> . at least five m. perniciosa hydrophobin-encoding genes have been identified  <cit> . the differences in expression in mycelial mat cultures for basidiomata production were considerable. unlike four other genes for hydrophobin, one gene was shown to have increased expression in the presence of primordia  <cit>  and two were identified in a compatible m. perniciosa-t. cacao cdna library derived from green brooms  <cit> .

studies in other fungi show that hemolysin expression is specifically increased in the presence of primordia  <cit> , but in this experiment there was no significant increase in the expression of the genes that encode for aegerolysins. only one gene for pleurotolysin a decreased significantly. on the other hand, genes encoding cytochrome p <dig> mono-oxygenase and a heat shock protein had increased expression in the primordial stage, which may indicate the induction of fruiting in response to stress  <cit> . cytochrome p <dig> mono-oxygenases  are a super-family of haem-thiolate proteins that are involved in the metabolism of a wide variety of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds  <cit> . in c. cinerea, the cytochrome p <dig> similar to cyp <dig> is most expressed in pilei and seems to be involved in the synthesis route of aflatoxins that seem to be important for fruiting in aspergillus spp.  <cit> .

the appearance of primordia coincided with the decrease of transcripts for calmodulin and increased expression for genes coding for signaling proteins such as rho <dig> guanine nucleotide exchange factor , rho gdp-dissociation inhibitor, gtp-binding protein rheb homolog precursor, indicating that signaling is most likely mediated by fruiting-associated proteins of the ras family. additionally, the genes for cellular transport of glucose and gluconate were clearly more significantly transcribed at the primordial stage , while a probable transcription factor gal <dig> decreased. this indicates that glucose depletion of the medium, which occurs throughout the culture, must be important for fructification and must be related to camp signaling  <cit> . gene gti <dig>  encoding an inducer of gluconate transport in pseudomonas aeruginosa, controls glucose catabolism, increasing the low-affinity transport system of glucose  <cit> . the glucose transporter present in this test is rather similar to the high-affinity glucose transporter snf <dig>  although this has not been confirmed experimentally  <cit> . glucose metabolism can be related to fructification  <cit> .

the increase of gene transcripts for vacuolar atp synthase, phospholipid-transporting atpase and reductase levodione also indicates that nutrient uptake during the primordial stage serves to form nutrient reserves prior to basidiomata elongation  <cit> . this is confirmed by the increase of transcripts for several genes of primary and secondary metabolism that may be related to the synthesis of glycerol and lipids. in c. cinerea reserves are remobilized and glycogen accumulated in the primordial stage  <cit> .

the expression of three genes related to cell division was significantly higher, two for a  <dig> kd protein of cell division  and one encoding a suppressor of kinetochore, and one pim <dig> gene was significantly less expressed in the primordial stage. cdc <dig> proteins are regulators of eif <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae and are regulated by nutrient availability  <cit> . this simultaneous increase indicates the predominance of phase g <dig> of cell division. as the formation of spores occurs in already differentiated primordia, it is likely that the collected phase contains a larger number of non-differentiated primordia.

there was also a significant increase of six genes of unknown function, one of them showing no similarity with any sequence in the available public data banks.

expression analyses of genes involved in basidiomata development by rt-qpcr
the gene expression profile obtained by the macroarray in two distinct phases suggested physiological changes in mycelia prior to basidiomata production. however, more detailed analyses should be performed to monitor the expression of key genes . quantitative pcr is an accurate technique to analyze gene expression. it is  <dig>  to  <dig>  times more sensitive than rnase protection assays and  <dig>  times more sensitive than dot blot hybridization  <cit> . therefore, a more detailed rt-qpcr analysis was performed with  <dig> ests in order to observe a possible relationship between transcript levels of all samples collected . rna was obtained from mycelium samples of all seven developmental stages: white, yellow and reddish pink phases, before and after stress, and during basidiomata formation.

the hypothesis that nutrient depletion might act as a signal for fructification was confirmed since some genes related to primary metabolism and to nutrient uptake were down-regulated when primordia emerged. conversely, gene expression related to nutrient recycling and stress response increased during this phase, as did the expression of genes directly involved in cell development . the relative expression of the  <dig> genes in stages that precede fructification helped elucidate the correlation between nutrient depletion and fructification  since the genes mprheb, mprho1-gef, mpade, mpmbf, and mprab putatively involved in signaling are associated with internal perception of the signals triggered by nutrient depletion and other stresses, which was noticeable before the primordia appeared. the putative gene mprheb is associated with growth regulation probably during nitrogen depletion  <cit> . its expression in m. perniciosa increased in reddish pink mycelium, immediately before stress and continued at a high level until the beginning of the primordial and basidiomata phases . the expression of the high-affinity transporter mpglu  <cit>  peaked in this mycelium before stress , strongly indicating a nutritional deficit, namely low external glucose concentration. moreover, expression of mpcpr and mpcyp was low during this period , indicating a lower basal metabolism  <cit> . the expression of mprab  may indicate nutrient remobilization, since it is involved in intracellular traffic  <cit> .

during the water stress applied to trigger in vitro fructification expression of some genes peaked. transcripts of putative mpmbf , a co-activator related to tolerance to abiotic stresses in plants  <cit> , increased  <dig> -fold . other genes with increased expression during this stress period were mprho1-gef , involved in signaling for the regulation of polarized growth  <cit>  and mprpl <dig>  involved in protein synthesis. involvement of signalization, probably camp-mediated, is likely due the expression of adenylate cyclase that decreased in the yellow and reddish-pink mycelial phases, to return to the original levels observed on white mycelium just after the stress period . as adenylate cyclase is subject to post-translational regulation, studies of enzymatic activity would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. the gene p-rho/gef is, therefore, possibly correlated with camp pathways. repression of the glucose transporter coincided with the repression of the adenylate cyclase gene, which also indicates camp signaling. in s. pombe the glucose levels are regulated by adenylate cyclase  <cit>  and in sclerotinia sclerotiorus the development of reproductive structures is negatively regulated by camp  <cit> 

putative aegerolysins and pleurotolysin b of m. perniciosa are differentially expressed during fructification
as described for other fungi, probable hemolysins are highly expressed at the fructification stages  <cit> . we identified three putative genes involved in fructification, two more closely related to the identified aa-pri <dig> or prias of agrocybe aerogerita and p. ostreatus, respectively, and one more closely related to pleurotolysin b, also identified in p. ostreatus. their different expression profiles suggested that they are different genes . the expression of mppria1encoding a putative aegerolysin, decreased in the yellow- and reddish pink-mycelium phases, and also before stress, but increased  <dig> -fold in mycelia with primordia, and about 90-fold in the basidiomata, compared to the white mycelium stage . the expression of the putative hemolysin-encoding gene mppria <dig> increased 17-fold at the reddish pink mycelium stage, but decreased 11-fold before stress, 4-fold in stressed mycelia, and  <dig> -fold in mycelia with primordia. the transcripts of mppria <dig> increased 23-fold in basidiomata, but were lower in mycelia with primordia . the transcripts of gene mpplyb, corresponding to a pleurotolysin b, increased  <dig> -fold in the yellow mycelium stage,  <dig> -fold in reddish pink mycelia, and remained at high levels in the mycelia before stress , when stressed  and in mycelia with primordia , but decreased in basidiomata, where it was only  <dig>  times higher than in white mycelia .

hemolysins, already identified in some bacteria and fungi, comprise a cytolytic protein family, whose members appear abundantly during primordia and basidiomata formation  <cit> . mppria <dig> and mppria <dig> have homologous regions but seem to correspond to two individual genes whose expression coincides with the morphological differentiation of primary hyphal nodules from primordia. these hemolysins may contribute to the process of hyphal aggregation  <cit>  as their expression occurred, although at low levels, before the appearance of primordia, when hyphae became globose for the formation of the "initials". this stage coincides with the reddish pink mycelium stage, where hyphal nodules are detectable. the exact function of these proteins remains unclear, but their involvement in programmed cell death , as proposed by kues and liu  <cit> , seems rather unlikely because ostreolysins have lytic function, acting in cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-containing membranes  <cit>  at a ph between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , which is not usually found in fungal cells.

the known fungal hemolysins have some variations in amino acid sequences, but all share the conserved domain aegerolysin . aegerolysin aa-pri <dig> from a. aegerita has the same molecular weight as the  <dig> kda ostreolysin of p. ostreatus and is mainly expressed in the initial stage of primordium formation. pria  of p. ostreatus forms a subfamily with the aegerolysin superfamily, which includes the asp-hemolysins of aspergillus fumigatus, and some hypothetical proteins of clostridium bifermentans, p. aeruginosa and neurospora crassa. p. ostreatus hemolysin consists of multiple components with isoforms a and b that assemble to a protein complex that leads to the formation of transmembrane pores , specifically allowing lysis of cholesterol and sphingomyelin-containing membranes  <cit> . isoform a, called plya  has  <dig> amino acid residues whereas the  <dig> kda isoform b polypeptide  consists of  <dig> amino acids.

the two aegerolysin ests expressed by m. perniciosa constitute two distinct genes . mppria <dig> has an orf of  <dig> bp with an intron at position  <dig> whereas the orf of mppria <dig> is  <dig> bp long with an intron at position  <dig> . both have a conserved aegerolysin domain between residues  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>  and can be aligned with a hypothetical protein mper_ <dig>   and mper_ <dig>  of m. perniciosa fa <dig> and proteins described as aegerolysins of a. aegerita , p. ostreatus , a. fumigatus af <dig> , a. fumigatus  coccidioides immitis rs  a. niger  . the evolutionary distance between these putative aegerolysins and above-cited aegerolysin of the gene bank database was estimated . the distances were shorter between mppria <dig> and mppria <dig> and aegerolysins of pleurotus and agrocybe than between mpprias and asp-hemolysins and ostreolysins of aspergillus.

the mpplyb orf has  <dig> bp and two introns  at positions  <dig> and  <dig> corresponding to the genomic dna of m. perniciosa in position  <dig> to  <dig> of the sequence deposited in genebank . the mpplyb orf is more similar to hypothetical proteins of m. perniciosa fa <dig>  and pleurotolysin b gene described for p. ostreatus  and it can be aligned with proteins described as gibberella zeae ph- <dig>  a. flavus nrrl <dig>  and chaetomium globosum cbs  <dig>   . a conserved transmembrane domain mac/perforin  occurs between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  the evolutionary distance between these putative pleurotolysin b and above-cited proteins of the gene bank database was estimated . the distance was shortest between mpplyb and pleurotolysin b of pleurotus, while the similarity with hypothetical protein mper_ <dig> of m. perniciosa was highest.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of gene expression is an initial approach to correlate gene expression with distinct developmental stages of m. perniciosa basidiomata. gene expression profiles in mycelia before basidiomata induction indicate that the observed morphological changes correlate with induction of genes known to be involved in the development of new macroscopic structures in other fungi. an involvement of a glucose depletion-dependent cell signaling is suggested by the regulation of adenylate cyclase and glucose transporter genes. however, other up-regulated genes may be responsible for the formation of hyphal nodules, redirecting cytoskeleton modeling, hyphal thickness or nutrient uptake, and most of them may be essential for the maintenance of basidiomata. our data provide new information about the development of basidiomata in m. perniciosa and identify a set of genes probably involved in this process. this information may be useful for further studies towards a more complete understanding of the cell processes and genetic, physiological and environmental controls leading to basidiomata initiation. once the key genes that determine growth and development of m. perniciosa are known, strategies can be provided for an enhanced control of this phytopathogen and for a successful monitoring of witches' broom disease in t. cacao.
