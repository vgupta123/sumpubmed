BACKGROUND
the first cell divisions of the preimplantation embryo rely on a number of maternal-effect factors that have been stored in the egg throughout folliculogenesis and that guide early development during the maternal-to-embryo transition, when embryonic genome activation  occurs and novel transcripts and proteins are produced as a requirement for further development  <cit> . if the expression of single maternal-effect genes is experimentally altered during mouse oogenesis or in the zygote, most of the embryos arrest development at the 2-cell stage or a few cell divisions later in preimplantation  <cit> . a question that remains unanswered is concerned with the nature of the transcriptional networks  in which maternal-effect genes operate. this knowledge would further our understanding of the molecular identity of a developmentally competent egg  and would allow to investigate how this identity is modified during the switch to an embryonic control of development.

oct <dig>  is one of the  <dig> maternal-effect genes reported so far  <cit>  whose transcripts inherited by the zygote are necessary for development beyond the 2-cell stage  <cit> . most of our knowledge on oct <dig> functions comes from studies that describe its key role in the control of transcriptional regulatory circuits that maintain pluripotency in the inner cell mass  of the blastocyst  <cit>  and in embryonic stem cells   <cit> . furthermore, oct <dig> is recognised for its capacity, when ectopically expressed in combination with other transcription factors , to reprogram differentiated cells into pluripotent cells   <cit> .

recent studies have also shown a role for oct <dig> in the acquisition of the egg developmental competence  <cit> . during oocyte growth the oct <dig> protein is first detected at the time of follicle recruitment, only in one of two major classes of oocytes present in the mouse ovary, named surrounded nucleolus  oocytes and recognisable for the presence of a ring of heterochromatin surrounding their nucleolus; on the contrary, oct <dig> expression is comparativelly down-regulated in nsn  oocytes that lack of a ring of heterochromatin around the nucleolus  <cit> . this distinct pattern of expression is maintained throughout oocyte growth, in fully matured antral sn and nsn oocytes and in their derived miisn and miinsn oocytes, respectively  <cit> . the most striking difference between these two categories of oocytes is that only miisn oocytes may develop beyond the 2-cell stage and reach full term development  <cit> . oct <dig> down-regulation in miinsn oocytes correlates with the down-regulation of the maternal-effect factor stella  <cit>  and with the up-regulation of eighteen oct4-regulated genes that are part of a gene expression network implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis  <cit> , explaining the developmental block encountered by 2-cell embryos obtained from miinsn oocytes . this data indicate that oct <dig> is an important component of a maternal regulatory tn that influences positively  or negatively  the oocyte developmental competence. the molecular identity and extension of this tn, as much as whether its presence is circumscribed to the egg or, after fertilisation, is maintained beyond the first mitotic division, remains to be understood.

in the present study, by comparing the genome-wide transcriptional profile of ovulated mii oocytes that express the oct <dig> protein  to that of mii oocytes in which oct <dig> is comparativelly down-regulated , we unveiled an expanded maternal oct4-tn made of  <dig> genes. then, by comparing the transcriptional profile of 2-cell embryos derived from miictrl oocytes  to that of embryos derived from miinsn oocytes , we showed that the oct4-tn has a core group of  <dig> genes that remains expressed beyond fertilisation and the first segmentation division. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are notable companions of the oct <dig> transcriptome in escs and the majority is expressed in cancer cells.

RESULTS
gene expression profiles of developmentally incompetent and competent mii oocytes or 2-cell embryos
to highlight genes with altered expression  in developmentally incompetent miinsn oocytes, we first compared their transcription profile with that of miictrl oocytes using microarray data from our previous work  <cit> . the data lists obtained earlier were revised since the data banks from which information was recovered are constantly updated.

a list of regulated and annotated genes or gene sequences  was retrieved after setting a  <dig>  fold-change threshold and a detection p value â‰¤  <dig> . using the gene ontology  enrichment analysis tool provided by the data mining and bioinformatics software orange http://www.ailab.si/orange,  <dig>  out of  <dig> regulated genes were assigned to seven major biological processes , including development, cellular and macromolecule localisation, apoptosis, transcription, intracellular signalling, cell cycle and translation. this analysis showed that the great majority of these genes were up-regulated in miinsn oocytes .

next, using the same fold-change and p value thresholds, we generated another list of regulated genes by comparing the transcription profile of 2-cellnsn vs. 2-cellctrl embryos. out of  <dig> regulated genes,  <dig>  were assigned to thirteen major biological processes. figure 1b shows the number of up- and down-regulated genes in each of these processes.

in summary, we retrieved two lists of regulated genes that highlight the changes occurring to the transcriptional signature of developmentally competent eggs or 2-cell embryos, when compared to their incompetent counterparts. our next step was aimed at the identification of known oct4-regulated genes within each of these two lists.

a maternal oct <dig> transcriptional network is constituent of the molecular identity of both mii oocytes and 2-cell embryos
using mouse and human chip datasets of oct4-regulated genes in escs  <cit> , we singled out a group of  <dig> oct4-regulated genes whose transcripts were detected in both the mii oocyte and 2-cell embryo microarray lists. when compared to miictrl samples, the great majority of these genes were up-regulated in developmentally incompetent miinsn oocytes in which the oct <dig> protein is markedly down-regulated , suggesting a down-regulatory function of this transcription factor over these genes. by comparing 2-cellnsn with 2-cellctrl embryos, we found that the expression of the majority of this group of  <dig> genes was higher in the latter , indicating that the down-regulatory function of oct <dig> had been released. in fact, following fertilisation, the maternal oct <dig> protein present in miictrl oocytes is carried over into the zygote and by the 2-cell stage becomes undetectable  <cit> , to reappear again, expressed from the embryonic genome, at the 8-cell stage  <cit> .

the hypergeometric test confirmed that the up- and down-regulated pattern of expression of  <dig> of these oct4-regulated genes in miinsn oocytes and 2-cellnsn embryos , respectively, was not a stochastic event, but instead a specific characteristic of this group of genes at these two developmental stages . the results of the microarray analysis for five of these genes were confirmed by qrt-pcr .

of these  <dig> oct4-regulated genes, we analysed the expression profile of those proteins for which an antibody was commercially available, i.e., dnmt3l <dig>  rps <dig> and mcl <dig> . dnmt3l is a crucial factor for the establishment of genomic imprinting in oocytes and the expression of dnmt3l increases during preimplantation in both mouse and rhesus monkey, suggesting a developmental role  <cit> . rps <dig> is a ribosomal protein involved in translation and its role in preimplantation as never been investigated before. immunolabeling of dnmt3l and rps <dig> antibodies was positive in miinsn oocytes  and 2-cellctrl , whereas it was negative in miictrl  and 2-cellnsn embryos , confirming the reversal pattern of expression described for their transcripts during the passage from the egg to the 2-cell stage.

our next step was aimed at determining whether the oct4-tn could be further expanded and better characterised.

numerous genes of the maternal oct <dig> transcriptional network are known members of the oct <dig> interactome in escs
using the network explorer module provided by the orange software , we explored public databases for links  between the group of  <dig> oct4-regulated genes used as bait , and all the annotated mouse gene sequences. this search retrieved an annotation network made of a total of  <dig> genes ,  <dig> of which were components  of our mii oocyte and/or 2-cell embryo list of regulated genes. this network was combined with the results of gene expression differential analysis to infer transcriptional relationships among the genes of an expanded oct4-tn. the expanded oct4-tn, made of  <dig> genes , comprised  <dig> genes expressed exclusively in mii oocytes ,  <dig> genes solely in 2-cell embryos  and  <dig> genes in both mii oocytes and 2-cell embryos . the oct4-oetn contained all the  <dig> oct4-regulated genes, except  <dig> that were not annotated and thus excluded; most  of the remaining  <dig> genes were up-regulated in miinsn oocytes but down-regulated in 2-cellnsn embryos. besides these  <dig> oct4-regulated genes, the oct4-oetn included  <dig> more genes of a recently published list of oct4-correlated transcripts expressed in escs  <cit>   and  <dig> genes for which a direct or indirect action of oct <dig> on their expression will need to be further investigated.

when compared to their respective control samples, more than half of the oct4-oetn genes  were up-regulated in miinsn oocytes but down-regulated  in 2-cellnsn embryos;  <dig> genes were down-regulated in oocytes and up-regulated in embryos, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> genes where down- and up-regulated, respectively, in both oocytes and embryos .

among the  <dig> newly expressed genes, dppa <dig> , gata <dig> and zeb <dig> are the best known and their main functions will be described in the section below.

in summary, this analysis brought to light in mii oocytes, a maternal oct4-tn made of  <dig> genes. within this circuitry, we could identify a restricted oct4-oetn made of  <dig> genes as core component common to the molecular identity of both eggs and 2-cell embryos. almost half , each containing at least one of the  <dig> oct4-oetn genes. based on go annotations and on a literature catalogues search,  <dig> of the  <dig> clusters could be ascribed to a major biological function. a description of the main characteristics of each gene cluster and of those oct4-oetn genes for which functional details were retrieved is given in additional file  <dig> <cit> . in summary, those oct4-oetn genes for which we could retrieve solid information fell into three main categories with >  <dig> genes: 1) cancer,  <dig> genes ; 2) preimplantation development-pluripotency,  <dig> genes ; 3) cell division,  <dig> genes . among the poorly known genes remaining, there is a group made of  <dig> genes  with apoptotic/anti-apoptotic functions, whereas all the others could not be grouped as they fell into several different categories, each with less than three genes. this information improves our understanding of the maternal oct4-tn composition, but also will serve as basic knowledge for further dissection and future studies of its role in oogenesis and preimplantation development.

most genes of the maternal oct <dig> transcriptional network are also expressed in cancer cells
since one of the most abundant categories singled out when dissecting the expanded oct4-tn correlated with cancer, we interrogated a more specific repository of cancer-related genes, i.e., genes that, compared to controls, are significantly up- or down-regulated in a wide variety of solid and non-solid tumours . strikingly, the great majority,  <dig> out of  <dig>   of the expanded oct4-tn and  <dig> out of  <dig> oct4-oetn genes  , were recognised as cancer-related genes. the non-stochastic nature of these frequencies was confirmed by the hypergeometric test .

discussion
each cell type in our body has its own molecular identity defined by a number of transcriptional networks that operate and cooperate to maintain the cell integrity and a specific undifferentiated/differentiated status. during cell differentiation some transcriptional network die out or fade one into another while guiding the cell towards the acquisition of a specific phenotype. transcriptional inheritance is the load of transcripts and active genes that are passed to the subsequent step of differentiation. likewise, the mammalian egg reaches the fertilisation encounter with a transcriptional inheritance representative of its developmental legacy. as part of this molecular identity, in this study we brought to light an oct4-tn of maternal origin that is present during the developmental period comprised between the mii oocyte and the 2-cell embryo . as hereafter described, these results allowed the generation of novel hypotheses on the developmental role of a maternal oct <dig> transcriptional inheritance during the early stages of mouse preimplantation development.

one marked phenomenon that occurs during the developmental interval comprised between ovulation and ega is the inactivation or degradation of a considerable number of transcripts mainly by processes of deadenylation  <cit> , but also through the association with rna-binding proteins  <cit>  and elimination by small silencing rnas that degrade mrnas or repress their translation  <cit> . the maternal oct4-tn that we identified has its maximum expansion in mii oocytes, comprising  <dig> genes, then, following fertilisation, more than half  of these transcripts are markedly down-regulated, to become almost undetectable in 2-cell embryos, suggesting their prompt degradation or deadenylation at the beginning of development . interestingly, this group of genes includes oct <dig>  sox <dig>   <cit>  and klf <dig>  oct <dig>  sox <dig> and klf <dig> are central to the maintenance and promotion of cell pluripotency  <cit> . their down-regulation after fertilisation may signal the execution of the egg developmental programme , then, at later stages of development, they are re-expressed, but only in some blastomeres, namely those that will contribute to the icm, to induce their pluripotent status; on the contrary, they are kept down-regulated in those cells that will contribute to the trophectoderm. in support of this hypothesis, a recent paper has demonstrated that oct <dig> re-expression occurs at the 8-cell stage embryo  <cit>  and is dissimilar in single blastomeres  <cit> , suggesting a possible different developmental commitment. the developmental block encountered by 2-cellnsn embryos could be associated , to abnormal expression or distribution of transcripts or proteins following the first segmentation  <cit> . to this regard, our analysis of dnmt3l and rps <dig>  whilst demonstrating a differential expression of both transcripts and proteins in 2-cellctrl vs. 2-cellnsn embryos, it did not evidence a differential distribution in the two blastomeres , although, at this stage, we cannot role out this hypothesis because of the low sensitivity power of an immunocytochemistry analysis.

the  <dig> oct4-oetn gene transcripts that survive the massive post-fertilisation degradation represent the maternal oct4-tn inheritance that is passed from the mii oocyte to the 2-cell embryo. following fertilisation some of the transcripts of these genes might be translated  and their proteins, together with those of the group of  <dig> newly activated genes, may play a role during the following stages of development. this core oct4-tn, that shares  <dig> genes with an oct <dig> regulatory network active in escs, might represent the molecular signature of maternal origin on which the escs molecular identity is built up and tailored, thus providing a link between eggs, early preimplantation embryos and escs .

the expression of the oct <dig> protein during oogenesis first occurs at the time of follicle recruitment  <cit> , when oocytes have reached a size of approximately 30- <dig> Î¼m in diameter, suggesting that the beginning of the oct4-tn establishment might occur at this stage of oocyte growth.

the significant presence of cancer-associated genes as part of the oct <dig> transcriptome is a theme shared with escs  <cit> , suggesting that an oct <dig> circuitry may be operating also in cancer cells and providing a molecular link between the regulation of pluripotency and the acquisition of dedifferentiation in cancer cells  <cit> . furthermore, in view of the cancer stem cell hypothesis  <cit> , the presence of an oct4-tn in cancer cells may help the identification and characterisation of the stem cell population within the tumor.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified an oct4-tn that is established during oogenesis and that partially survives the wide transcriptional erasure that occurs soon after fertilisation. its core oct4-oetn circuitry of  <dig> genes is maintained up to the 2-cell stage of development and may represent part of the transcriptional signature that is conveyed to the icm. the oct4-tn that we described provides a useful resource to 1) further study the mechanisms of oct <dig> function and regulation during the maternal-to-embryo transition; 2) explore the link between the regulation of pluripotency and the acquisition of dedifferentiation in cancer cells; 3) improve our understanding of the molecular factors that contribute to the mammalian egg developmental competence and give opportunities for testing new prognostic molecular markers of oocyte quality in animal and human assisted reproduction.
