BACKGROUND
the development of pcr and next-generation sequencing techniques has facilitated studying microbial communities without it being necessary to culture individual members. because growth requirements vary greatly among different species, and for some species growth conditions have not yet been determined, molecular methods in microbiota investigations are advantageous. however, culture-free approaches may introduce biases in the experimental pipeline, starting from dna extraction through the generation of sequencing libraries to data analysis. identification of unexpected taxa in datasets derived from low-density microbiota , diluted mock communities  <cit> , and cultures  <cit> , demonstrated that a variable fraction of sequence reads originated from exogenous dna. the sources of these contaminants are reagents used in dna extraction, pcr, and next-generation sequencing library preparation, and possibly human  microbiota from the investigators  <cit> .

sample datasets can be decontaminated by removing sequence reads assigned to operational taxonomic units  found in negative extraction controls . bioinformatics pipelines for performing microbiome analysis such as qiime  <cit>  facilitate performing this step in an automated manner. some otus identified as contaminants across different studies were repeatedly assigned to the same species or genera  <cit> . however, an otu that corresponds to the genuine member of the microbiota of interest may also be found in relevant necs. it has been suggested not to remove otus identified in necs if they are biologically expected in the given sample type  <cit> . the distinction between expected and unexpected otus in a given sample type may not be always straightforward. for example, propionibacterium is a known reagent contaminant but it is genuinely present in the skin microbiota in proportions that vary between individuals  <cit> . similarly, stenotrophomonas, another common reagent contaminant, emerged as a new airway pathogen  <cit> , that may complicate the analysis of respiratory tract samples.

the need to recognize as many contaminants as possible based on differences in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa between necs, low-density samples, and high-density samples has been highlighted  <cit> . others proposed that contaminant otus excluded should be those whose relative abundance in necs is above a given threshold  <cit> . inverse correlation of a taxon relative abundance with bacterial load as an indicator of a possible reagent contaminant was initially described for bacterial genera in a mock community  <cit>  and subsequently confirmed at the otu level in cultures and ‘real’ microbiota samples  <cit> .

the removal of otus whose mean relative abundance in necs is higher than that of microbiota samples of interest has been used to decontaminate datasets obtained by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of relatively low-density skin and respiratory tract bacterial communities  <cit> . however, the absolute abundance of certain otus may be substantially higher in microbiota samples than in relevant necs, even if their relative abundance shows the opposite pattern. it is advisable not to remove such otus, as they correspond to the microbiota of interest. here, we further develop this approach by combining relative abundance of otus with bacterial load in dna extracts assessed by quantitative real-time pcr .

RESULTS
bacterial load determined by culture and qpcr
staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli overnight cultures were washed and concentrated, and resulted in  <dig> x <dig> and  <dig> x <dig> colony-forming units /ml, respectively. serial decimal dilutions of these master stocks were aliquoted in triplicate and frozen. dna was extracted from each of the three identical series of aliquots on separate occasions. serial culture dilutions down to 10− <dig> correlated with decreasing dna yields in purified extracts determined by qpcr targeting the v <dig> segment of the bacterial 16s rrna gene with universal bacterial primers . further dilutions  of the master stocks had dna quantity estimates similar to those of necs obtained by substituting culture for water  or lysis buffer  in dna extraction. the lowest dna concentration was found for no-template controls  in which water was used instead of dna extract. bacterial loads determined by qpcr based on s. aureus  or e. coli  reference curves showed similar patterns.fig.  <dig> bacterial load assessed by qpcr. the universal bacterial primers used in qpcr target the v <dig> segment of the 16s rrna gene. bacterial loads were determined using the standard curves obtained with s. aureus mw <dig>  or e. coli dh5α  genomic dna. the s. aureus and e. coli genomes weigh approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  fg and contain six and seven 16s rrna gene copies, respectively. each symbol  corresponds to the series of aliquots processed at a given point and represents the mean of duplicate measurements with relative deviations from the mean < <dig>  %. bacterial load is expressed as the number of e. coli or s. aureus genome equivalents in 1 μl of dna extract. serial decimal dilutions of the master stock are indicated from 1e <dig>  to 1e- <dig> . sa, s. aureus; ec, e. coli. nec_b, negative extraction controls obtained by substituting culture for lysis buffer; nec_w, negative extraction controls obtained by substituting culture for water; ntc_w, no template  control reactions performed by substituting dna extract for water



taxonomic analysis of samples and negative controls
the sequence dataset generated by illumina sequencing of v3– <dig> 16s rrna gene amplicons was represented by 9042– <dig>  reads per sample after quality filtering and otu mapping. the proportion of quality-filtered sequences with no hits  in the greengenes reference database  <cit>  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  for master culture stocks and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for negative controls . the rdp classifier  <cit>   assigned these sequences to pseudomonadales , parcubacteria , actinomycetales , unclassified bacteria  and unclassified organisms .

a total of  <dig> otus were identified in the final dataset of which  <dig> were found only in samples,  <dig> were specific to negative controls, and  <dig> were found in both. otus richness in nec_w and nec_b were similar to each other but higher than that of ntc_w. in the dataset normalized to the same number of sequences per sample , otu richness increased as bacterial counts decreased .fig.  <dig> otu richness across the samples before and after in silico decontamination. r-otu  cut-offs of  <dig> to  <dig>  were applied for decontamination. this ratio was calculated from the relative otu abundance and qpcr data obtained using the s. aureus standard curve. dilutions of the master stock are indicated from 1e <dig>  to 1e- <dig> . ec, e. coli; sa, s. aureus. nec_w, negative extraction controls obtained by substituting culture for water; nec_b, negative extraction controls obtained by substituting culture for lysis buffer; ntc_w, no-template pcr controls; nd, no decontamination was performed



serial culture dilutions were associated with a decrease in the proportion of sequence reads assigned to escherichia or staphylococcus, and an increase in the relative abundance of reads that derived form contaminants. pseudomonas was major contaminant, and was most abundant in negative controls and highly diluted samples . interestingly, otus assigned to pseudomonas had different profiles in necs  and ntc_w. for example, otu <dig> and otu <dig>  which dominated necs and ntc_w, respectively, differed in  <dig> residues in the sequenced v3– <dig> region. these results show specific contamination of both dna extraction and pcr reagents. the most abundant otus in ntc_w, which corresponded to the contaminants of the pcr reagents, were identified in most necs, where they were outnumbered by otus from contaminants from dna extraction. however, the otus highly abundant in necs were mostly absent from ntc_w. the similarity of nec_w to nec_b and its difference from ntc_w otu profile indicate that ultrapure water was not the major source of dna contamination.fig.  <dig> relative abundance of predominant otus. otus with a mean relative abundance >1 % in either samples, negative extraction controls or ntc_w are presented. the proportion is indicated by the scale at the bottom of the plot. dilutions of the master stock are indicated from 1e <dig>  to 1e- <dig> . for ec, sa, nec_b and nec_w, the data obtained from dna extractions performed on three occasions  are presented from left to right. ntc_w were performed in duplicate for each of the three series. ec, e. coli; sa, s. aureus. nec_w, negative extraction controls obtained substituting culture for water; nec_b, negative extraction controls obtained by substituting culture for lysis buffer; ntc_w, no-template pcr control



in the sequence data from highly diluted e. coli cultures, we identified a substantial proportion of otus assigned to staphylococcus and, also found escherichia otus in the sequence data from diluted s. aureus. these results and the fact that staphylococcus has not been previously recognized as reagent contaminant  <cit>  indicate cross-contamination during dna extraction from samples with high bacterial load, notably by e. coli in experiment  <dig> and by s. aureus in experiment  <dig> . however, the proportion of cross-contaminants was lower than that of reagent contaminants.

in silico decontamination procedure
to obtain an approximate estimation of the ‘absolute’ abundance of otus, expressed in arbitrary units, we multiplied the relative abundance of each otu by the 16s rrna gene copy number of a given sample . we then calculated the ratio  between mean ‘absolute’ abundance of otus in necs and culture samples. the dataset was decontaminated in silico using four r-otu cut-off values , by removing otus for which this ratio was exceeded. the proportion of the bacterial genera escherichia, staphylococcus and pseudomonas before and after decontamination are shown in fig.  <dig>  the decontamination procedure improved the taxonomic profile of low-abundance  culture samples. for example, at a 10− <dig> dilution, staphylococcus and escherichia corresponded to  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of reads, respectively, but after decontamination using an r-otu cut-off of  <dig> , they increased to >80 % of reads.fig.  <dig> effect of in silico decontamination on taxonomic profiles of culture dilutions and negative extraction controls. means for three samples obtained in separate dna extraction experiments are given. the r-otu  cut-offs of  <dig> to  <dig>  were applied for decontamination. this ratio was calculated from the relative otu abundance and qpcr data obtained using the s. aureus standard curve. dilutions of the master stock are indicated from 1e <dig>  to 1e- <dig> . ec, e. coli; sa, s. aureus. nec_w, negative extraction controls obtained by substituting culture for water; nec_b, negative extraction controls obtained by substituting culture for lysis buffer; nd, no decontamination was performed



very few reads  assigned to escherichia or staphylococcus were affected by the decontamination procedure using r-otu of  <dig> . pseudomonas, which represented 37–63 % of reads in 10− <dig> to 10− <dig> dilutions, was completely or nearly completely removed by decontamination . decontamination of necs resulted in datasets that contained  <dig> –100 % reads assigned to a combination of staphylococcus and escherichia . the profiles of otu abundance  point to cross-contamination by both e. coli and s. aureus during sample handling.

the decontamination procedure also attenuated the trend of increase in otu richness in serially diluted cultures .

discussion
our pipeline for removal of reagent contaminants in sequence datasets combines the relative abundance of otus in v3– <dig> 16s rrna gene amplicon datasets with bacterial dna quantification based on qpcr targeting of the v <dig> segment of the 16s rrna gene. both pcr and qpcr may introduce biases by preferential amplification of certain targets. however, our results showed only a limited impact of organisms chosen to generate the standard curve in qpcr experiment. decontamination procedures based on e. coli and s. aureus standard curves resulted in comparable results with r-otu thresholds of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . these two bacteria are phylogenetically relatively distant, as they belong to two different phyla , have different genome sizes  and differ in the number of 16s rrna gene copy number .

the r-otu cut-offs of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  had a similar effect on the removal of contaminants for the two pure bacterial cultures in our study. however, the r-otu cut-off that best separates contaminants from expected taxa may be influenced by the taxonomic composition and bacterial load of the samples analysed in a given study. defining the threshold that removes as much contaminant taxa as possible while not affecting the taxa of interest remains an arbitrary choice in both decontamination procedure we used and other approaches.

although decontamination procedures both in silico and in the wet lab are not yet fully developed, they improve the taxonomic profiles of microbiota, thus providing benefits when samples  are available in limited amount and/or have low bacterial load. longer 16s rrna gene sequences, lower sequencing error rates, and otu clustering at identity thresholds >97 % may contribute to better distinction between contaminants and ‘real’ otus. in addition to further development of bioinformatics and statistical approaches for decontamination after sequencing, it may also be advantageous to reduce dna contamination of laboratory reagents during their manufacturing and reduce the risk of sample-to-sample contamination during the experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that removal of contaminant otus derived from reagents based on the combination of qpcr data and relative abundance of otus may improve taxonomic representation in samples with dna concentrations close to those of necs. using the described approach, otus derived from cross-contamination, in contrast to those derived from reagents, were not recognized as contaminants and not removed from the dataset. the approach we used in this study may prove useful in situations where otus identified in negative controls have higher relative abundance but lower absolute abundance compared with microbiota samples.
