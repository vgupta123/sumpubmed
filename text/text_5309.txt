BACKGROUND
embryonic stem cells are potentially a source of all cell types but the problem of converting these cells to desired cell types with high efficiency in vitro has remained a challenge in transplantation and developmental biology  <cit> .

since embryoid bodies contain a mixture of ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal germ layers, differentiation of stem cells to neurons has usually been achieved by protocols that enrich ectoderm derivatives, as a first step in the production of neural progenitors. these attempts to influence cell fate decisions to obtain cells of the ectodermal layer involve the use of neuralizing signals that can be derived from feeder cells, addition of growth factors, or growth supplements added to the medium  <cit> . es cell-derived progenitors with characteristics of ectoderm have been converted to neurons by several methods, and in many instances further steps have been designed to specify individual neuronal types  <cit> . neural progenitors from es cells also give rise to glial cells  <cit>  and sensory cells  <cit> . however, the protocols are often complicated and can be expensive and time consuming, requiring several weeks of specific culture conditions to obtain cells that have the capacity to differentiate into neurons.

we have found that murine es cells differentiate into neural progenitors in defined medium in spheres, and we have been able to obtain neurons fairly rapidly with little manipulation and with few expensive reagents. this procedure takes advantage of the differentiation to neural lineage cells in floating spheres as well as the survival of these neural precursors in serum-free medium. we have used es cell lines that have been engineered to express reporters for the progenitor state and the fully differentiated state to show that these cells give rise to the desired differentiated cell types. the protocol does not use feeder cells or embryoid body formation and is similar to the monolayer expansion and differentiation protocol of ying et al.  <cit> , but differs from that protocol by the use of floating spheres which substantially increases the yield of neural progenitors. the progenitors obtained from the serum starvation and suspension culture give rise to neurons, glial cells, and oligodendrocytes. they can be expanded by adherent culture with bfgf and retain their capacity to differentiate into neurons. this protocol will be useful for rapid generation of large numbers of neural progenitors that can be used in studies of transplantation and developmental biology.

methods
mouse stem cells for differentiation
es cell lines used were yc5/eyfp cells derived from the totipotent cell line r <dig>  <cit>  which carry the gene for enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  under the control of a cytomegalovirus enhancer coupled to the beta-actin promoter ; sox1-gfp es cells  that contain a gfp reporter gene under the control of a sox <dig> promoter  <cit> ; and tau-gfp es cells  that carry the gene for a tau-gfp fusion protein  <cit> . the stem cells were propagated on gelatin-coated plates in es cell medium consisting of dmem  containing 15% fbs ,  <dig> mm mem nonessential amino acids ,  <dig>  mm 2-mercaptoethanol, l-glutamine, and leukemia inhibitory factor . early passage cells were frozen for later use.

formation of neural progenitor cells
murine es cells were thawed and grown to confluence prior to trypsinization for  <dig> min until detached cells were visible. the trypsin was inactivated by addition of 10% fbs in dmem/f <dig>  and the cells were centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> rpm and plated on non-tissue culture coated dishes in dmem containing n <dig> supplement . the cells were cultured on petri dishes in dmem supplemented with n <dig>  and penicillin-streptomycin. floating spheres formed in suspension and were examined for reporter-based fluorescence  during culture for the next  <dig> d.

expansion of neural progenitor cells and neuronal differentiation
the spheres that were non-adherent at the end of the culture period were collected by centrifugation at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were trypsinized for  <dig> min at 37°c with shaking. trypsin was inactivated with 10% fbs in dmem/f <dig> and the cells were collected by centrifugation at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. after removal of the supernatant by aspiration the cells were suspended in dmem/f <dig> containing 10% fbs and plated on gelatin-coated and tissue culture-coated plastic dishes. after overnight attachment, the medium was removed and replaced with dmem/f <dig> supplemented with n <dig> and b <dig>  in the recommended concentrations and containing bfgf  and penicillin/streptomycin. they were grown to confluence and passaged every  <dig> d.

these neural progenitors were differentiated by growth in dmem/f <dig>  containing n <dig> and b <dig> after removal of bfgf. the cells were cultured in this medium with replacement of half the medium every  <dig> d for time periods given in the text and monitored for loss of sox1-gfp based fluorescence and gain of tau-gfp based fluorescence.

culture of cells for electrophysiological recordings
frozen progenitor cells were thawed at 37°c and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the supernatant was discarded and the cells were washed once in dmem containing 10% fbs and plated as above. after overnight culture, the medium was replaced with fresh dmem/f <dig> with bfgf and the medium was refreshed every other day.

the cells were trypsinized after reaching confluence and plated onto coverslips pretreated with  <dig> % fibronectin. differentiation was initiated by culture overnight in dmem/f <dig> containing 10% fbs followed by culture in the medium above without bfgf. half the differentiation medium was refreshed every  <dig> d, and the cells were allowed to differentiate for time periods given in the text.

semiquantitative rt-pcr
total rna was extracted with an rneasy minikit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. for reverse transcription,  <dig> μg of total rna was used with superscript iii transcriptase  and oligo-dt primers. the pcr cycling conditions were optimized in pilot experiments. specific cycling parameters were: initial denaturation step at 94°c for  <dig> min, followed by cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> s, annealing temperature optimized between 56-60°c for  <dig> s, extension at 72°c for  <dig> s, followed by  <dig> min of terminal extension at 72°c after the last cycle. the number of cycles was optimized between  <dig> and  <dig>  and conditions were kept constant for each primer. the presented data are from experiments repeated at least  <dig> times. control pcr without reverse transcriptase did not produce specific bands. the primer pairs and cdna product lengths were:

electrophysiology
differentiated cells were placed into a recording chamber and viewed with a zeiss axioskop fs equipped with a 63× water-immersion lens and dic optics. recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass  with resistances that ranged from 3- <dig> mw. the pipette tips were coated with ski wax to reduce pipette capacitance.

for electrophysiological recordings, cells were bathed in a standard extracellular solution that contained :  <dig> nacl,  <dig> kcl,  <dig>  cacl <dig>   <dig> mgcl <dig>   <dig> hepes, vitamins  and amino acids  as in mem. the solution was adjusted to ph  <dig>  with naoh and an osmolarity of  <dig> mosmol/kg. recording pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution containing :  <dig> kcl,  <dig>  mg-atp,  <dig>  cacl <dig>   <dig>  mgcl <dig>   <dig> ethylene glycol-bis  -n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid, and  <dig> hepes, adjusted to ph  <dig>  with koh and an osmolarity of  <dig> mosmol/kg.

the whole-cell, tight-seal recording technique was used in both voltage- and current-clamp modes. all cells were held at - <dig> mv and data were acquired at room temperature  using an axopatch 200b amplifier , filtered at  <dig> khz with a low pass bessel filter, digitized at  <dig> khz with a 12-bit acquisition board, and acquired using pclamp  <dig>  software .

all membrane potentials were adjusted for a  <dig> mv junction potential. analysis was then performed using both the clampfit  <dig>  software  and origin  <dig>  . data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation, unless otherwise noted.

to determine the range of activation and inactivation for k+ and na+ conductances, we used a boltzmann equation of the form:

  

gmax and gmin represented the maximum and minimum conductances respectively, v1/ <dig> was the half maximal voltage, and s represented the slope factor.

immunohistochemistry
floating spheres were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs for  <dig> min. after  <dig> washes with pbs cells were permeabilized and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with pbt <dig> solution  and 5% heat-inactivated goat serum in pbs) for  <dig> min. the spheres were frozen in oct and cryosectioned. fixed and permeabilized sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight in antiserum diluted in pbt <dig>  dilutions used were 1: <dig> for mouse monoclonal tuj antibody , 1: <dig> for polyclonal rabbit anti-neurofilament m  , 1: <dig>  for mouse monoclonal antibody to neun , 1: <dig> for rabbit polyclonal antibody to gfap , 1: <dig>  for rabbit polyclonal antibody to neurod , 1: <dig>  for goat polyclonal antibody to sox <dig> , 1: <dig>  for mouse monoclonal antibody to nestin , 1: <dig> for rabbit polyclonal antibody to peripherin , 1: <dig> for mouse monoclonal antibody to o <dig> , and 1: <dig>  for mouse monoclonal antibody to tyrosine hydroxylase . specimens were washed  <dig> times for  <dig> min each with pbs. anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to fitc, tritc and cy <dig>  were used to detect primary antibodies. cell nuclei were stained by exposure to  <dig> -diamidino-2-phenylindole. labeled cells were counted as a percentage of dapi-stained nuclei . staining was visualized with epifluorescence microscopy  or confocal microscopy .

RESULTS
formation of neural progenitors in a defined medium
mouse es cells containing the gfp gene under the control of the sox <dig> promoter  <cit>  were trypsinized and dispersed into serum-free medium with n <dig> and b <dig> additives on an uncoated dish. the es cells lacked green fluorescence, and floating spheres that formed in these culture conditions were not fluorescent after a  <dig> d floating culture  but exhibited bright green fluorescence after  <dig> d in culture . most of the cells that remained in small clumps attached to the dish did not become fluorescent , but the cells in the aggregates referred to as floating spheres showed high expression of the sox <dig> reporter . comparison of the starting es cells to the cells in the floating spheres after a  <dig> d culture revealed that the cells in spheres lost expression of stem cell marker oct <dig> completely , had decreased expression of nanog, and continued to express the neuronal progenitor marker, otx <dig>  in agreement with the expression of the sox <dig> reporter, mrna for sox <dig> was not found in es cells, but was observed in the neural progenitors obtained at the end of this culture period .

the green fluorescence was shown to correspond to sox1-gfp expression by staining of nuclear sox <dig> in cells that had gfp expression in the cytoplasm . neuronal lineage markers including nestin , peripherin, and neurod  were expressed in the floating spheres. cells in sox1-positive spheres expressed markers of both neurons and glia, as shown by immunolabeling for tubulin and neurofilament  and gfap .

staining of the spheres for apoptotic markers showed that regions of the spheres underwent programmed cell death in serum-free medium. apoptosis was detected in all floating spheres and the spheres gave rise to cells that expressed β-iii tubulin . staining for cell death in the spheres indicated that apoptotic cells  were in close proximity to β-iii tubulin-positive cells . this observation suggested that the adjacent cells might have an influence on the generation of ectoderm and the formation of neuronal precursors. we hypothesize based on our recent data in human es cells  <cit>  that cell death may have been due to selective pressure of the serum-free medium that did not permit survival of non-ectodermal cells.

propagation of progenitors in bfgf and neural differentiation
the neural progenitors obtained in the floating spheres were expanded by growth in a monolayer. when the neural progenitors were cultured on tissue culture plastic, the spheres attached and grew in combination with cells that grew out as a monolayer from the islands . we tested the expression of markers in the cells after they had attached to plastic and been cultured in medium containing bfgf for  <dig> d. the cells maintained their expression of neural progenitor markers such as sox <dig> based on fluorescence . both attached cells and floating spheres from which they were derived showed expression of neuronal precursor markers such as nestin . they also maintained expression of markers of neuronal ectoderm, pax <dig> and pax <dig>  they increased expression of drg and placodal progenitor markers, ngn <dig> and math <dig>  respectively . these markers reveal that the expanded progenitors had the capacity to develop into several neuronal lineages.

induction of neural differentiation by the removal of growth factors gave rise to neurons, glial cells and oligodendrocytes . neurons with cytoplasmic staining for β-iii tubulin were obtained in high yield , and neun expression was detected in their nuclei , while glial cells  staining for gfap and oligodendrocytes staining for o <dig> constituted less than 10% of the total cells . these ratios varied with the length of time taken for differentiation. the populations of neurons included cells that were developing as dopaminergic types  as revealed by tyrosine hydroxylase staining .

fluorescent reporters in the differentiated neurons
es cells engineered to express a tau-gfp fusion protein were not fluorescent at the es cell or neural progenitor stage, but after differentiation to neurons, the cells showed strong expression of tau-gfp . outgrowth of neurites from the cells was detected readily because of the intense labeling of neurites . cells expressing this reporter also displayed expression of neurofilament-h, trkc and map <dig> in the cells differentiated from progenitors . these progenitors and the differentiated neurons expressed a wide array of developmental regulators  similar to regulatory molecules expressed by newborn sensory ganglia.

functional characteristics of differentiated stem cells
in order to assess the functionality of cells that had been through the differentiation, whole-cell, tight-seal recordings were taken. cells were allowed to differentiate in vitro for up to  <dig> d. we recorded both voltage-dependent currents in voltage-clamp mode and membrane potentials in current-clamp mode. we recorded from a total of  <dig> cells:  <dig> of these displayed no current ,  <dig> exhibited neuronal-like k+ currents, while the remaining  <dig> cells had both k+ and na+ currents with neuronal characteristics . furthermore, we found that in current-clamp mode, the differentiated cells generated action potentials . of the  <dig> cells that expressed voltage-dependent currents, we selected data from  <dig> cells for more quantitative analysis based on the quality of the recording .

to analyze the properties of the voltage-dependent k+ currents in the neuronal cells we examined them in voltage-clamp mode. we applied voltage steps that ranged from - <dig> to  <dig> mv every  <dig> mv, which evoked slowly activating outward currents that did not inactivate. the mean peak amplitude of the currents was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  na at  <dig> mv  . the mean reversal potential of the outward k+ current was calculated by applying a depolarizing step to  <dig> mv to activate the outward current, followed by test steps that ranged from - <dig> to - <dig> mv in  <dig> mv intervals. the tail currents were measured immediately after the test step and were plotted as a function of test potential to determine the mean reversal potential , which was similar to the potassium equilibrium potential. we also examined the voltage range of activation for the k+ currents by applying voltage steps that ranged from - <dig> to  <dig> mv every  <dig> mv, followed by a step to - <dig> mv. the tail currents observed at the instant of the step to - <dig> mv were recorded and divided by driving force to generate conductance. conductance was plotted as function of prepulse potential and fitted with a first order boltzmann equation . the mean v1/ <dig> of activation for the k+ currents was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv with a slope of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv  and the mean maximal conductance was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns .

the cells also expressed fast activating, fast inactivating na+ currents . to analyze these currents, a 100-msec prepulse to - <dig> mv was applied to relieve na+ channel inactivation, followed by voltage steps that ranged from - <dig> to  <dig> mv every  <dig> mv. the protocol evoked small inward na+ currents with mean peak amplitudes of - <dig> ±  <dig> pa . the mean v1/ <dig> of activation was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv with a slope of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . na+ inactivation was also examined by applying voltage steps ranging from - <dig> to - <dig> mv in  <dig> mv intervals for  <dig> msec followed by a step to - <dig> mv. we recorded the peak current evoked by the step to - <dig> mv and plotted these data as a function of prepulse potential. we fit the data with a boltzmann equation and observed a v1/2of inactivation of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv with a slope of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv .

in order to study the membrane potential characteristics of the neuronal cells, we used current-clamp mode. action potential generation was observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> cells that exhibited both k+ and na+ currents. in all  <dig> cells, action potentials were evoked in response to 300-msec current injections that ranged from - <dig> to  <dig> pa . in one case the cell fired spontaneously in the absence of stimulation . the mean resting potential of the cells was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv .

another population of cells was examined which displayed only outward k+ currents and had neither na+ currents nor generated action potentials. the voltage-dependent properties of these cells were analyzed using the same protocols as mentioned previously. the mean peak k+ current amplitude measured at  <dig> mv was  <dig>  ±  <dig> na . using a first order boltzmann equation to fit the k+ conductance values, we calculated the v1/ <dig> of activation to be - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv with a slope of  <dig> ±  <dig>  mv . as these cells only displayed outward k+ currents, we suspect that they were immature neurons and that had they been allowed longer culture times they would have expressed na+ currents and acquired the ability to generate action potentials.

discussion
we describe a new method for the conversion of es cells to neuroectoderm progenitors that uses floating spheres to induce the es cells to develop into neural progenitors and serum-starvation to inhibit the development of other embryonic progenitors in order to achieve production of the desired progenitor cells in high yields. this method has the advantage that the differentiation of the cells and loss of pluripotency is well-controlled, giving rise to a cell population that is primarily of neuroectoderm lineage. the formation of neural progenitors appears to be aided by programmed cell death of adjacent cells in the floating spheres.

compared to methods that use formation of embryoid bodies prior to selection for neural lineage, the method is rapid and requires less intensive cell culture. both neuronal lineage specification and generation of functional neurons occur in  <dig> d, with  <dig> d to form the floating spheres containing neural progenitors and  <dig> d to obtain neurons. the protocol does not require feeder cells and is less complicated than those requiring rosette formation and selection of individual colonies by hand prior to expansion of progenitors  <cit> . neural lineage specification is presumably assisted by the formation of spheres, suggesting a similarity to the organization of neurospheres that are readily formed from adult neural stem cells  <cit> . enrichment of cells that formed neurons upon subsequent differentiation was also observed in a method that used spheres but maintained the spheres in a pluripotent state by inclusion of leukemia inhibitory factor  in the medium  <cit> . methods involving monolayer culture  <cit>  for generation of neural progenitors are also rapid and simple but may not result in the same numbers of neurons as obtained in the floating spheres, and a method using floating culture for human es cells was less efficient for the generation of neurons than the method described here  <cit> . the monolayer culture method is not applicable to human es cells  <cit>  since the cells formed clumps and the neural cells arose in these clumps. compared to methods that use low density culture in the presence of lif  <cit>  to generate floating spheres, the method described here is independent of added growth factors. this is presumably due to the higher cell density in the spheres that we use for generation of the neural progenitors, which takes advantage of endogenous paracrine factors, as shown in a recent study that also used spheres. in that study, spheres generated in the presence of n <dig> supplement and lif contained intermediate progenitors that were competent for neurogenesis but expressed es cell markers  <cit> . this was unlike the spheres in our study, which lose expression of es cell markers upon their conversion to progenitors in the serum-free medium which contains n <dig> supplement but does not contain lif. the low-density methods are not applicable to human es cells that require higher cell density for survival. we have recently shown in a separate paper  <cit>  that our method is applicable to human es cell lines using the same procedures. the reporter cell lines that we used detected the initial conversion of these cells to neural progenitors as well as the subsequent differentiation of these cells to neurons.

the formation of the neural progenitors followed pathways that were identical to those seen in vivo and these cells can therefore be used to study neuronal differentiation. they gave rise to neural lineage cells expected from neural progenitors including neurons, glia and oligodendrocytes. during the in vitro differentiation of the es cells to these progenitors, oct <dig> was observed to decrease as pax <dig> and pax <dig> increased. the expression of pax <dig> preceded that of sox <dig>  as observed for precursors of motor neurons  <cit> . as in the developing otic placode, the expression of math <dig> was upregulated after that of both otx <dig> and pax <dig>  we obtained neurons that could be detected by expression of pax <dig>  neurod, trkc, and brn3a all of which are expressed in developing neuroepithelium. at the same time that these neuronal specification genes were upregulated, the developmental regulators, bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> continued to be expressed as has been observed by others in stem cell derived progenitors  <cit> , and wnt pathway genes were increased. expression of these markers showed that the neural progenitors had the capacity to develop into several neuronal lineages and this was illustrated further by the differentiation of dopaminergic neurons identified by tyrosine hydroxylase staining  <cit> .

the apoptosis of progenitors is apparently a required step in the high yield of neuroectoderm achieved. reduction in endoderm and mesoderm markers in the course of the maturation of the spheres was apparent in our recent work  <cit>  and the accompanying increase in nestin and pax <dig> and pax <dig>  markers of neural progenitor cells, is indicative of the formation of neuroectoderm lineage in the spheres as previously observed  <cit> . the close apposition of dying cells with the newly formed neural lineage is similar to the programmed cell death that accompanies the development of the embryonic nervous system  <cit> , and the differentiation of the neural progenitor cells may be driven by inductive signals emanating from dying cells. the cells that undergo apoptosis are most likely from nonneuronal lineages that don't survive under the culture conditions used.

the neurons formed from these neural progenitors could be induced to generate action potentials and were, therefore, functional neurons that could potentially be used for replacement of cells lost to neurodegeneration. the neuronal phenotype that we have observed in vitro has prompted us to use the neural progenitors for studies of neuronal replacement in an in vivo model, and we found  <cit>  that neurons differentiated from mouse and human es cells integrated into the host tissue. the neurons will be valuable in cell transplantation applications based on preliminary results  that the neural progenitors make synaptic vesicles at their growing tips and express axonal markers upon contact with sensory hair cells of the inner ear in a cultured explant of the cochlea  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
neurons and glial cells were differentiated from es cells by a method that initially produced neuroectoderm by a combination of nonadherent conditions and serum starvation. neurons are obtained in high yield in  <dig> d, with  <dig> d to form the floating spheres and  <dig> d for neural progenitors to differentiate into neurons. the neurons obtained stain for neuronal markers and are functional. the protocol does not require feeder cells and is less complicated than those requiring rosette formation and selection of individual colonies. neural lineage specification is presumably assisted by the formation of spheres, similar to those formed from neural stem cells.
