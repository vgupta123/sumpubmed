BACKGROUND
lantibiotics form a particular group among the antimicrobial peptides  and are characterized by unique structural features. these result from extensive posttranslational modifications that yield the ring forming thioether amino acids lanthionine and/or 3-methyllanthionine. the ring structures contribute to enhanced resistance towards proteolysis  <cit>  and to increased tolerance to oxidizing conditions  <cit> . in fact, the designation "lantibiotics" is derived from "lanthionine containing antibiotics". lantibiotics are produced by and act against gram-positive bacteria and exert multiple modes of action like pore formation and/or inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . mersacidin is the smallest lantibiotic known so far  and is produced by bacillus sp. strain hil y- <dig> . it is an uncharged molecule of  <dig> amino acids forming four intramolecular thioether bridges, which confer a globular structure to the molecule  <cit> . mersacidin inhibits the transglycosylation reaction of cell wall biosynthesis by complexing the sugar phosphate head group of the peptidoglycan precursor lipid ii, thereby using a target binding site that is different from any other clinically used antibiotic  <cit> . it has been shown to successfully inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains  in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

the glycopeptide vancomycin has been the antibiotic of choice to treat infections with mrsa and acts by binding the d-alanyl-d-alanine terminus of the peptide side chain of lipid ii. considering the emergence of vancomycin intermediately resistant s. aureus strains  since the late 1990s  <cit> , new effective treatment strategies for mrsa are urgently needed. in this context, lantibiotics could represent alternatives for clinical applications  <cit>  and mersacidin might be a blueprint for the development of new antibiotics to control nosocomial infections  <cit> .

previous gene expression studies of kuroda et al. and utaida et al. concerning the s. aureus responses to the cell wall-active substances vancomycin  <cit> , oxacillin, bacitracin and d-cycloserine  <cit>  identified a cell wall stress stimulon, which seems to be predominantly regulated by the vrasr two-component regulatory system . members of this stimulon comprise the vrasr genes together with genes related to the cell wall metabolism of s. aureus like murz, upps, baca, pbp <dig>  sgtb and genes related to protein metabolism. hence, the vrasr tcrs has been shown to positively regulate the important steps of the cell wall biosynthesis pathway as a response to cell wall stress  <cit> . recently, mcaleese et al. described a core cell wall stress stimulon of  <dig> genes by merging their own results, that had been recorded in the presence of vancomycin, together with the results of kuroda et al. and utaida et al.  <cit> . in conclusion, the cell wall stress stimulon is characterized through a comprehensive response that involves manifold cellular processes. this general cell wall stress response seems to be conserved among gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . most recently, the transcriptional profile of the s. aureus response to the lantibiotic nisin has become available  <cit> . nisin acts by lipid ii-based pore formation and inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . the s. aureus response to nisin  was relatively moderate and an induction of the cell wall stress stimulon was not observed.

in our study, we used gene expression profiling by employing full genome s. aureus microarrays and quantitative real-time pcr  techniques to elucidate the transcriptional response of s. aureus to subinhibitory concentrations of mersacidin. to this end, we employed three s. aureus strains providing varying susceptibility characteristics, namely the vancomycin- and methicillin-susceptible  strain s. aureus sg <dig> as well as the heterogeneous visa/mrsa strain s. aureus sa137/93a and the closely related visa/mssa strain s. aureus sa137/93g  <cit> . since self-protection against mersacidin is mediated by an abc-transporter in the producer strain, we also assessed the role of the abc transporter vrade, which was upregulated during exposure to mersacidin, to counteract the action of mersacidin by employing a vrae-defective mutant of strain sg <dig>  <cit> . we further examined the influence of cell wall thickness on the activity of mersacidin, because a thickened cell wall is proposed to be one of the key resistance mechanisms to vancomycin  <cit> .

RESULTS
susceptibility of s. aureus sa137/93a, s. aureus sa137/93g and s. aureus sg <dig> to mersacidin
the three strains displayed considerable differences in their susceptibilities to mersacidin. while the growth of s. aureus sg <dig> was already inhibited by  <dig> μg/ml mersacidin in bhi medium, the minimal inhibitory concentrations  of mersacidin against sa137/93a and sa137/93g were  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml in bhi broth, respectively. notably, the growth retardation occurred  <dig> hour after addition of the lantibiotic .

transcriptional response of s. aureus in the presence of mersacidin
s. aureus sa137/93a and sa137/93g were grown in bhi broth to an od <dig> of  <dig> , then subinhibitory concentrations of mersacidin  were added. samples were taken  <dig> minutes  after addition of mersacidin, before the decreased growth rate became apparent . s. aureus sg <dig> was grown with  <dig> × mic of mersacidin to induce a mersacidin-dependent transcriptional response, since the profile of the growth curve of s. aureus sg <dig> at  <dig> × mic was comparable to that recorded for the visa strains at  <dig>  × mic .

gene expression profiles of the mersacidin-treated s. aureus strains were compared to non-treated control cells and displayed extensive changes in gene expression. these changes were similar for all three tested strains and involved the transcript levels of  <dig> genes that were significantly changed  upon mersacidin treatment in at least one of the tested strains, with  <dig> genes exhibiting increased transcript levels  and  <dig> genes showing decreased transcript levels .

mersacidin strongly induced the cell wall stress response of s. aureus
in the presence of mersacidin, the induction of the vrasr-triggered cell wall stress stimulon was one of the most striking events of gene regulation  and included  <dig> genes of the  <dig> cell wall stress stimulon members  <cit> . similarly,  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> genes of the vrasr regulon  <cit>  were upregulated after exposure to mersacidin . furthermore,  <dig> out of the  <dig> members of the core cell wall stress stimulon  <cit>  were differentially expressed after mersacidin treatment.

 <dig> significant changes of gene expression were determined by implementing sam   <cit> .

 <dig> fold change in transcript level indicated as mean of the "median of ratios" compared to control cells. fold change in bold = classified as "significantly" regulated in this strain by sam.

the vrasr genes and several cell wall biosynthesis genes were strongly upregulated, which included the putative monofunctional glycosyltransferase gene sgtb, the transpeptidase/transglycosylase gene pbp <dig> and the udp-n-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxylvinyl transferase gene murz, as well as tcaa and drp <dig>  the predominant induction of the glutamate  and lysine  amino acid biosynthesis pathways might also support cell wall biosynthesis, since glutamate and lysine represent essential components of the peptidoglycan precursor lipid ii. in fact, the disruption of the dap operon or the lysa gene has been shown to be involved in a decrease of oxacillin resistance and growth attenuation of s. aureus  <cit> . especially in strain sa137/93a, mersacidin treatment induced the transcription of the baca and upps genes, which are involved in lipid ii carrier regeneration and synthesis. expecting the carrier level to be a limiting factor when lipid ii is blocked by mersacidin, an enhanced availability of carriers might be beneficial for peptidoglycan synthesis. in consequence of the peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibition, gene expression for cell wall lytic enzymes  was negatively affected. in terms of membrane trafficking, the oligopeptide transport system genes oppbcdf and the components of the phosphotransferase system  were upregulated. while an increased expression of the pts may boost the import of glucose to supply additional energy, the induction of oppbcdf might support cell wall biosynthesis by the acquisition of essential amino acids.

since incubation with  <dig>  × mic of mersacidin was sufficient to massively induce the cell wall stress response, we further examined the gene expression profile of strain sa137/93g at even lower concentrations using dna microarrays . incubation with  <dig>  × mic  of mersacidin was sufficient to significantly alter the expression of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes of the vrasr regulon  <cit>   and  <dig> out of  <dig> genes belonging to the core cell wall stress stimulon  <cit> . these results show, that inhibitory antibiotic concentrations are not an obligatory requirement for the induction of the cell wall stress stimulon as it is the case for e.g. vancomycin and oxacillin  <cit> . compared to  <dig>  × mic, the response was reduced after employing  <dig>  × mic in strain sa137/93g , suggesting a dose-dependent effect on gene expression.

induction of vras transcription by mersacidin
to verify the induction of the cell wall stress response by the autoregulatory vrasr tcrs  <cit> , overexpression of the sensor histidine kinase gene vras was further analyzed via qrt-pcr . in the presence of  <dig>  × mic of mersacidin, a strong induction of vras transcription  was observed in all strains tested. even  <dig>  × mic of mersacidin considerably induced vras gene transcription in strain sa137/93g  and strain sg <dig>  . as a control, strain sa137/93g was incubated with subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin . here, no induction was visible by qrt-pcr. this is also confirmed by earlier studies of other groups who employed multiple mics  of cell wall affecting agents like vancomycin, oxacillin or bacitracin to induce the cell wall stress response  <cit> , while low inhibitory or subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin or oxacillin did not lead to an induction  <cit> . likewise, an induction of the cell wall stress response could not be observed for the lantibiotic nisin at inhibitory concentrations  <cit> . nisin acts by fast depolarization of the cell membrane as a cause of lipid ii-based pore formation rather than by inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . thus, the bacteria will be rapidly inactivated by nisin which prevents an adequate response to cell wall damage through the vrasr-stimulon. hence, mersacidin turned out to be a strong inducer of the cell wall stress response in s. aureus compared to other substances like vancomycin, oxacillin, bacitracin and nisin.

a comparison of the transcript levels of vrasr of all tested strains showed that the levels did not vary significantly between the strains . since the vrasr genes have been found to be more highly expressed in some visa compared to vssa, the vrasr tcrs has been proposed to be involved in the visa-type resistance mechanism via contribution to cell wall thickening  <cit>  and the deletion of the vrasr locus has been described to influence the development of resistance towards glycopeptides and β-lactams  <cit> . however, the cell wall stress response was similarly induced upon mersacidin treatment in the visa strains as well as in the susceptible strain in our studies and all strains showed equal basal transcript levels. interestingly, the induction of vrasr did not depend on the absolute concentration of mersacidin in the medium but seemed to be triggered by the stress itself, since  <dig>  μg/ml of mersacidin massively induced the cell wall stress response in the susceptible strain sg <dig> , while vras transcription levels were not significantly affected in strain sa137/93g . therefore, the vrasr tcrs might have evolved as a damage-sensing system that is indirectly induced as a cause of cell wall damage rather than a drug sensing system that recognizes the drug itself at defined concentrations. this is also indicated by findings showing that vrasr responds to various cell wall-active antibiotics as well as other conditions of cell wall stress. in this regard, the bacitracin-dependent induction of the liars tcrs in bacillus subtilis, a close homologue of vrasr, also indicated a damage-sensing mechanism  <cit> . this supports the idea of vrasr being a common accelerator system of peptidoglycan synthesis  <cit> , which reacts to perturbations of cell wall integrity.

extensive upregulation of the vrade abc transporter genes and the effect of vrade on the sensitivity towards mersacidin
the presence of mersacidin significantly influenced the regulation of several genes coding for hypothetical abc transporters such as sa <dig>  vrafg and vrade . indeed, the most prominent event of gene regulation involved the upregulation of vrade . the induction of vrade gene transcription was further verified via qrt-pcr . upon incubation with  <dig>  × mic, vrade expression was induced  <dig> to 79-fold in strain sa137/93a and sa137/93g, respectively. in the susceptible strain sg <dig>  the transcript level of the vrade genes rose almost 1700-fold upon incubation with mersacidin. this transporter has been previously shown to be inducible by vancomycin and cationic amps   <cit>  and seems to be involved in the increased resistance towards bacitracin and the human β-defensin  <dig>  in s. aureus  <cit> . however, the regulation underlying vrade induction has not been identified yet. the vrasr tcrs does not seem to be solely involved in the upregulation of vrade transcription as knock-out mutations of the respective gene locus did not lead to an altered expression of the vrade genes  <cit> . the upregulation to such an extent might indicate that vrade plays a critical role in the staphylococcal defense against mersacidin, especially since resistance is conferred by an abc transporter in the producer strain of mersacidin  <cit> .

to test whether vrade is able to transport mersacidin out of the cell membrane and therefore supports a resistance phenotype, the growth behaviour and mics of a vrae knock-out mutant of s. aureus sg <dig>  <cit>  and its parent strain were examined in the presence of the lantibiotic. since s. aureus sg511Δvrae had displayed significantly reduced resistance to bacitracin and the lantibiotics nisin and pep <dig>  <cit> , vrade was considered to be functional in the parent strain. unexpectedly, s. aureus sg511Δvrae did not show increased susceptibility towards mersacidin neither in growth curve recordings  nor in mic studies . subsequent nucleotide sequencing of the vrade genes including the promoter region revealed, that the - <dig> and the - <dig> region as well as the ribosomal binding site and the vrad gene were highly conserved in strains sa137/93a and sg <dig>  and that the vrae gene showed  <dig> % sequence identity with mostly conservative amino acid substitutions . therefore, vrade is unlikely to contribute to mersacidin resistance, presumably because it is unable to transport the lantibiotic. this could be due to the properties of mersacidin which is globular, neutral and non-membrane disturbing. since vrade has been shown to predominantly transport linear, cationic, membrane interacting compounds, it might be unable to facilitate the transport of other antimicrobials as also shown for chloramphenicol and oxacillin  <cit> . however, it cannot be ruled out that the knockout phenotype is indiscernible through the activity of another abc transporter.

influence of a thickened cell wall of s. aureus on the activity of mersacidin
the visa strains tested here are characterized by a cell wall with an increased thickness, which is also formed in the absence of antibiotics  <cit> . actually, vancomycin intermediate resistance partly relies on an increase in cell wall material  <cit> , which might result from an activated cell wall metabolism. in order to estimate the influence of an increased cell wall thickness on the action of mersacidin, cells with increased amounts of peptidoglycan were obtained by incubation in resting medium  for two hours. cell wall resting medium allows the biosynthesis of excess cell wall material, while the absence of essential amino acids prohibits growth. controls were performed in rm devoid of glucose , which is necessary for synthesis of extra cell wall material  <cit> . after incubation of the cells in rm or rm-g, the susceptibility to mersacidin was tested. vancomycin served as control in our studies. in the case of mersacidin, the incubation in the presence of glucose did not decrease the susceptibility of s. aureus sg <dig> and of the visa strains sa137/93a and sa137/93g , whereas the efficacy of vancomycin was always lower against cells that had been incubated in the presence of glucose. in strain sg <dig>  mersacidin was even more effective than vancomycin, which was not the case for the strains sa137/93a and sa137/93g.

the above results demonstrate that the cell wall thickness does not impact on the antibiotic efficacy of mersacidin. thus, the induction of the cell wall stress response at low mersacidin concentrations may be partly explained by the differences that characterize the interactions of mersacidin and vancomycin with the cell envelope. while mersacidin and vancomycin both target lipid ii, vancomycin acts by binding to the d-alanyl-d-alanine terminus of the peptide side chain of lipid ii. in a thickened cell wall, increased amounts of free d-alanyl-d-alanine termini provide false target sites for vancomycin binding. this results in a decreased diffusion velocity of vancomycin through the cell wall, the "clogging effect"  <cit> , and only those vancomycin molecules that are not trapped in the cell wall will reach lipid ii. in contrast to vancomycin, mersacidin complexes the sugar phosphate head group of the peptidoglycan precursor lipid ii, which is only present in the membrane and experiments with radiolabeled mersacidin have confirmed that it does not bind to isolated cell walls  <cit> . in in vitro cell wall biosynthesis systems, the effective concentration of mersacidin is in the same range as that of vancomycin  <cit> . therefore, although nearly similar molar concentrations  and  <dig>  μm vancomycin ) of the two antibiotics were used in the induction assays, less vancomycin than mersacidin molecules may have been available at the cell membrane for the binding of lipid ii. this effect could explain why higher concentrations of vancomycin have to be employed in order to induce the cell wall stress response and why lower initial concentrations of mersacidin may be sufficient for an effective induction of vrasr.

CONCLUSIONS
mersacidin strongly induces the cell wall stress response of s. aureus even at very low concentrations as compared to other antibiotics like nisin, vancomycin, bacitracin or oxacillin, thereby reflecting its unique mode of action. our results underline the important role of lipid ii in this context and demonstrate that the induction of the cell wall stress response is not in every case dependent on inhibitory concentrations of cell wall-active substances. furthermore, mersacidin represents a molecule that seems not to be a substrate for the multidrug resistance transporter vrade which apparently functions in the first line bacterial counter strategy against bacitracin and cationic toxic compounds. biochemical characterization of vrade and related transporters will test this hypothesis and may provide directions for circumventing the activity of resistance transporters through structural modification of antibiotics.
