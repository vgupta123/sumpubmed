BACKGROUND
both acute and chronic hyperglycemia are associated with inflammation  <cit> . patients with newly diagnosed or established diabetes mellitus  have significantly higher levels of acute-phase proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to control subjects without dm  <cit> . monocytes isolated from patients with type  <dig> diabetes produce increased levels of il- <dig>  il-1β and chemokines of the cxc family including il- <dig> and interferon gamma-induced protein  <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, monocytes from patients with dm produce higher levels of tnf-α and il- <dig> in comparison to control monocytes  <cit> .

tnf-α production is thought to play a role in the generation of microvascular complications associated with diabetes, e.g., by enhancing chronic eye inflammation  <cit> . in addition to triggering acute and chronic inflammation, tnf-α regulates glucose and lipid metabolism and inhibits insulin production in pancreatic beta cells  <cit> . tnf-α is also produced in adipose tissue.

in both clinical and experimental conditions, hyperglycemia has been shown to alter many cellular parameters. this metabolic state leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species , the activity of protein kinase c , and the expression of p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor κb , inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines  <cit> .

diverse mechanisms have been proposed to explain how hyperglycemia contributes to inflammation. for example, pkc activity may be increased secondarily to a poorly reversible, non-enzymatic protein glycation process, which could lead to the irreversible production of advanced glycation end products . ages are known to stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and macrophages through the activation of a specific receptor for ages   <cit> . additionally, hyperglycemia may stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines by increasing the levels of peroxides and free radicals. high serum concentrations of glucose can lead to enhanced glycolysis and mitochondrial overproduction of superoxide anion  and other reactive oxygen species , which directly induce the activation of protein kinase c  and nuclear factor κb   <cit> . indeed, these transcription factors have been shown to induce the release of il-1β and il- <dig> by human monocytes cultured under high glucose conditions  <cit> . the secondary effects of pkc and nf- κb activation resulting from hyperglycemia can further amplify the inflammatory response, resulting in the production of the chemokine ip- <dig> and the up-regulated expression of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> .

although these mechanisms can partially explain the high levels of inflammatory cytokines observed under acute hyperglycemic conditions, the effects of high glucose on other regulatory molecules involved in the control of inflammatory cytokine production have not yet been identified. low membrane expression levels of cd <dig> have been associated with higher levels of inflammatory cytokine production, and cd <dig> is expressed by myeloid progenitor cells of the bone marrow as well as peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes  <cit> . cd <dig>  which is also referred to as human sialic acid-binding ig superfamily lectin , is a member of the siglec family that includes  <dig> human proteins of i-type  lectins with a v-set ig-like domain and varying numbers of c2-set ig-like domains, such as sialoadhesins , cd <dig> , myelin-associated glycoprotein , and additional members from a subgroup that contains cd <dig>  and cd33-related siglecs   <cit> .

the regulation of cytokine production via cd <dig> is believed to depend on two putative conserved tyrosine-based signaling motifs contained within the cytosolic tail of cd <dig>  these signaling motifs, known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs , act as regulatory elements that inhibit signaling  <cit> . cd <dig> activity is regulated by socs <dig>  which is a member of the suppressor of cytokine signaling  protein family. the binding of socs <dig> to the phosphorylated itim of cd <dig> induces the proteosomal degradation of both molecules  <cit> , and the reduction of cd <dig> surface expression on monocytes by silencing with small interfering rna  or antibody blockade results in the increased secretion of il-1β, il- <dig>  and tnf-α  <cit> .

interestingly, the role of cd <dig> in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines secondary to hyperglycemia has not yet been explored. thus, the aim of the current study was to examine the effects of high glucose concentrations on the expression of cd <dig> and the production of cytokines in human monocytes from healthy individuals. additionally, from patients with type  <dig> diabetes, the levels of cd <dig> expression on freshly obtained monocytes and serum cytokine levels were evaluated and compared to those from healthy individuals. our results show that under hyperglycemic conditions, monocytes cd <dig> mrna and surface protein expression was decreased, whereas tnf-α production was increased. these changes were inhibited by antioxidant pre-treatment, suggesting that the hyperglycemic-dependent decrease in cd <dig> expression involves the generation of oxidative stress.

RESULTS
the clinical characteristics of the studied subjects are summarized in table  <dig>  there were no significant differences in gender, age, bmi, or the levels of creatinine or ldl or hdl cholesterol between the control group and the type  <dig> diabetes group. the levels of glucose, hba1c and triglycerides were significantly higher among type  <dig> diabetes subjects than control subjects. most patients with type  <dig> diabetes had received metformin and glibenclamide. only one of the diabetes patients had received metoprolol, and another had been administered clonazepam and levopromazine. none of the patients had been prescribed angiotensin receptor blockers, insulin, or statins. healthy donors did not have any infections or inflammatory diseases and did not take any medications during the study period.

data are means sd. *p values correspond to the differences between healthy and type  <dig> diabetes

diminished cd <dig> expression in monocytes from patients with type  <dig> diabetes
to determine whether cd <dig> expression is decreased in freshly isolated peripheral monocytes from type  <dig> diabetes patients relative to healthy control subjects, flow cytometry and qpcr studies were performed. as shown in figure  <dig>  a significant decrease in the cell surface expression of cd <dig> was detected in monocytes obtained from patients with type  <dig> diabetes, as compared to those from healthy volunteers  .

in addition, cd <dig> mrna expression was also reduced in monocytes from type  <dig> diabetes patients . because cd <dig> is a regulator of cytokine production, these findings suggest that low levels of cd <dig> expression could be involved in the elevated inflammatory cytokine production observed in patients with type  <dig> diabetes.

increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in plasma from patients with type  <dig> diabetes
we next measured the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood plasma of type  <dig> diabetes patients and healthy subjects. as shown in figure  <dig>  all of the pro-inflammatory cytokines evaluated  were increased in patients with type  <dig> diabetes, although only the increases in tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> p <dig> were statistically significant in comparison to healthy individuals  . in addition, tnf-α production by monocytes was assessed by quantitative real time pcr , and monocytes from patients with type  <dig> diabetes had significantly elevated levels of tnf-α mrna than controls  .

high glucose conditions down-regulate the surface expression of cd <dig> in cultured monocytes
cd <dig> is known to play a role in the regulation of cytokine production, and low levels of cd <dig> expression have been associated with high levels of inflammatory cytokine production. therefore, using flow cytometry, we measured the relative levels of cd <dig> surface expression on peripheral monocytes that were isolated from healthy volunteers and cultured in the presence of low or high concentrations of d-glucose. as shown in figures 3a and 3b, culturing monocytes with  <dig> or  <dig> mmol/l d-glucose for  <dig> days induced a significant decrease in cd <dig> expression on the cell surface, compared to culture conditions containing  <dig>  mmol/l d-glucose . cd <dig> mrna expression was also decreased in monocytes cultured for  <dig> days under high glucose conditions. as shown in figure 3c, cd <dig> mrna expression was significantly reduced in monocytes cultured in  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mmol/l d-glucose, compared to those cultured under normal glucose conditions  .

high glucose conditions induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production
previous studies have shown that high glucose concentrations in vitro induce the production of greater amounts of il- <dig>  <cit> , which is a cytokine that can regulate cd <dig> expression  <cit> . therefore, we evaluated the long-term effects  of high glucose conditions on the levels of interleukin-1β , interleukin- <dig> , interleukin- <dig> , interleukin- <dig> , interleukin-12p <dig> , and tumor necrosis factor  released into the supernatants of cultured monocytes using flow cytometry. in addition, we examined the levels of cytokine mrna using qpcr. concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> mmol/l d-glucose did not induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines . however,  <dig> mmol/l d-glucose significantly induced both tnf-α secretion  and tnf-α mrna expression, compared to  <dig>  mmol/l d-glucose  . in addition, an increase in il- <dig> p <dig> expression was observed, although it did not reach statistical significance. the levels of il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> were not increased under these conditions. these results suggest that the low levels of cd <dig> expression observed in monocytes cultured in high concentrations of d-glucose were not the result of autocrine il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig> or il- <dig> production. nonetheless, the reduction in cd <dig> mrna and cell surface protein expression may be associated with high levels of tnf-α production.

tnf-α production is increased in monocytes cultured under high glucose conditions
to investigate whether the observed increase in tnf-α production was mediated by an effect of high glucose concentrations on cd <dig> expression in monocytes, we assessed the production of tnf-α in monocytes expressing low or high levels of cd <dig>  as shown in figure 5a,  <dig> mmol/l d-glucose increased the relative percentage of cd33low monocytes, thereby decreasing the fraction of cd33high cells. however, both populations demonstrated increased tnf-α production. thus, these results indicate that in vitro hyperglycemia induces the overproduction of tnf-α in both cd33low and cd33high monocytes. however, the frequency of tnf-α-producing cells was significantly higher in the cd33low subset .

cd <dig> down-regulation and tnf-α production is prevented by α-tocopherol treatment
the generation of ros resulting from high concentrations of glucose is believed to contribute to hyperglycemia-induced inflammatory responses. thus, we assessed whether ros generation was involved in the production of tnf-α and cd <dig> expression by human monocytes cultured under high glucose conditions. as shown in figure 6a, the generation of ros by glucose was dose-dependent, and this effect was prevented by co-incubation with α-tocopherol, a compound known to reduce ros generation and tnf-α production  <cit> . additionally, α -tocopherol treatment prevented the decrease in surface cd <dig> expression by monocytes , the up-regulation of tnf-α mrna expression, and the secretion of tnf-α induced by high glucose conditions . thus, these results suggest that ros generation induced by high glucose concentrations is responsible for the down-regulation of cd <dig> expression and spontaneous production of tnf-α.

high glucose concentrations induce the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  in monocytes
recent studies have demonstrated that high glucose concentrations increase the expression of socs <dig> mrna in mononuclear cells  <cit> . furthermore, socs <dig> has been shown to induce proteosomal degradation of cd <dig> in adherent monolayers of human cells  <cit> . thus, we evaluated socs <dig> mrna expression in monocytes cultured under hyperglycemic conditions for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> h and  <dig> days. as shown in figure  <dig>  the levels of socs <dig> mrna increased after  <dig> h of culture in the presence of high glucose concentrations . although the levels of socs <dig> mrna had decreased after  <dig> days of culture, the levels detected at this time remained greater than those in monocytes cultured in  <dig>  mmol/l d-glucose. these results suggest that the down-regulation of cell surface cd <dig> expression mediated by high glucose concentrations may be regulated by increased levels of socs <dig> protein.

discussion
the primary finding of our study is that cd <dig> cell surface protein and mrna expression levels are significantly reduced in monocytes from patients with type  <dig> diabetes. the analysis of the plasma cytokine profile of patients with type  <dig> diabetes showed that pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were increased, although only the levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α were significantly increased when compared to healthy volunteers. these results suggest that the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of patients with type  <dig> diabetes could be related to the down-regulated expression of cd <dig>  increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of patients with type  <dig> diabetes have been widely reported  <cit> . on the other hand, spontaneous production of tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> was observed in human monocytes treated with anti-cd <dig> or by decreasing cd <dig> surface expression by rna interference  <cit> . although diverse mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increase of inflammatory cytokines in patients with type  <dig> diabetes, to our knowledge, this is the first study to describe an association between cd <dig> and the inflammatory cytokine profile in type  <dig> diabetes patients.

this study also demonstrated that high glucose concentrations in vitro resulted in decreased expression of cd <dig> protein and mrna in human monocytes from healthy donors.

in addition, we observed a significant increase in levels of tnf-α present in the supernatants of monocytes cultured under high glucose conditions , although this increase was not observed for other cytokines. increased levels of tnf-α mrna from monocytes cultured with  <dig> mmol/l glucose have previously been described for healthy individuals  <cit> . in addition, we did not detect an effect of high glucose concentrations on the production of il-1β or il- <dig> in monocytes. however, previous studies have reported inconsistent results; some have shown that hyperglycemia increases the production of il-1β and il- <dig> in the thp- <dig> cell line, whereas others have shown that hyperglycemia only induces the production of il- <dig> in primary human monocytes  <cit> . in addition, other studies have demonstrated reduced il-1β levels in raw <dig> murine macrophages exposed to 8- <dig> mmol/l d-glucose  <cit> . these differences may be related to differences in the cell types, glucose concentrations or lengths of culture time used to measure cytokine levels. other authors reported that high glucose concentration and lps treatment act synergistically for stimulate the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral mononuclear cells from humans  <cit> . consistent with the formerly mentioned data from other authors, our results presented here serve to extend previous knowledge of the role of high glucose concentrations on the promotion of inflammation by demonstrating the in vitro effects of high glucose concentrations on tnf-α production by human monocytes.

we also presented evidence demonstrating that high glucose concentrations in vitro could increase the proportion of cd33low monocytes and reduce the proportion of cd33high monocytes, although tnf-α production was increased in both cell populations. these results support the idea that hyperglycemia leads to an increase in tnf-α production through a cd33-mediated mechanism, although there are likely additional mechanisms involved in production of tnf-α that are beyond the scope of this study. furthermore, the spontaneous production of il- <dig> by cd33-/lowplasmacytoid dendritic cells from patients with diabetes without atherosclerotic complications has been reported  <cit> . these findings suggest that the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with type  <dig> diabetes may be partially associated with the subpopulation of cd33low monocytes.

the precise mechanisms by which hyperglycemia down-regulates cd <dig> expression have not yet been elucidated, although the generation of ros by high glucose concentrations is believed to contribute to hyperglycemia-induced inflammatory responses  <cit> . thus, we explored the association between ros generation and cd <dig> expression in monocytes cultured under high glucose concentrations and treated with α-tocopherol. the results showed that α-tocopherol decreased ros generation and prevented the effect of high glucose on cd <dig> expression. this result supports the idea that the oxidative stress generated by high glucose concentrations contributes to the down-regulation of cd <dig> 

we observed an inhibition of tnf-α production in monocytes that were cultured under conditions of high glucose and were treated with α-tocopherol. this result indicates that ros generation is involved in the tnf-α production by human monocytes cultured under high glucose conditions. thus, the low expression of cd <dig> and the inhibition of tnf-α production in monocytes cultured under high glucose concentrations are primarily related to ros generation. therefore, we propose that ros generation induced by high glucose conditions directly induces the down-regulation of cd <dig> expression. alternatively, ros generation could induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that could then regulate the expression of cd <dig>  a study by shamsasenjan et al. postulated that il- <dig> down-regulates cd <dig> expression in myeloma cells  <cit> . however, in the current study, il- <dig> production was not increased in the supernatants of monocytes cultured under high glucose conditions, and therefore, il- <dig> is likely not the mechanism responsible for cd <dig> regulation under hyperglycemic conditions.

in this study, we also showed that high glucose concentrations could up-regulate the expression of socs <dig> mrna in human monocytes, suggesting that this molecule may regulate the levels of monocyte cd <dig> expression. this hypothesis is consistent with results showing that socs <dig> could contribute to cd <dig> degradation in peripheral monocytes  <cit> . recently, it was reported that glucose ingestion induces the over-expression of socs <dig> in peripheral monocytes  <cit> . interestingly, socs <dig> expression is induced by tnf-α and could therefore represent a feedback mechanism for inflammation associated with cd <dig> regulation  <cit> . however, further studies are needed to assess whether tnf-α production regulates socs <dig> expression and its effect on cd <dig> expression.

our study had limitations, the most critical of which was the limited ability of our in vitro model to recapitulate what occurs in patients with type  <dig> diabetes. nonetheless, we demonstrated that a significant increase in tnf-α production and decrease in cd <dig> protein and mrna expression were induced by high concentrations of glucose . a concentration of  <dig> mmol/l is equivalent to  <dig> mg/dl of blood glucose, which is a concentration that is rarely attained in type  <dig> diabetes patients is much greater than the mean value found in the diabetes patients included in this study . hence, it is possible that the glucose sensitivity of tnf-α production associated with cd <dig> expression is greater in vivo than in vitro. however, this increased level of sensitivity may occur if other factors in vivo could potentiate glucose-induced ros generation. further studies are required to examine this possibility. the increase in tnf-α associated with the down-regulation of cd <dig> expression presented here constitutes an interesting in vitro model to further investigate the molecular processes involved in the modulation of inflammation by glucose.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that hyperglycemic conditions induce the down-regulation of cd <dig>  which triggers the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α by monocytes. the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the tnf-α release induced by cd <dig> down-regulation may involve the generation of oxidative stress and the over-expression of socs <dig>
