BACKGROUND
somatic cell fusion events are critical for development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. postnatal growth and repair also frequently rely on somatic cell fusion events, especially in tissues such as skeletal muscle that contain multinucleated cells. however, the genes and molecular mechanisms underpinning this fundamental cellular process in humans are largely unknown. multiple cell types including trophoblasts, osteoclasts and skeletal muscle require somatic cell fusion events in order to perform their physiological functions . the occurrence of cell fusion events in skeletal muscle provides a potential mechanism for the introduction of exogenous dna to cure genetic myopathies, while increasing evidence is emerging that fusion of cancer cells and bone marrow derived cells may enable and promote cancer metastasis . therefore, an improved understanding of how somatic cells fuse will likely have diverse clinical benefits.

in humans, a single skeletal muscle fibre can contain thousands of nuclei  <cit> . each nucleus present in the muscle fibre arises from asynchronous cell fusion events. post birth, skeletal muscle is a very adaptable tissue that is capable of repairing itself in response to injury such as that which accrues from damage-inducing exercise bouts  <cit> . the regeneration capacity of skeletal muscle is largely due to the presence of stem cell-like progenitor cells, termed satellite cells, that reside between the basal lamina and plasma membrane  <cit> . satellite cells are typically found in an inactive state, however, in response to muscle injury they proliferate and also fuse  in order to facilitate muscle repair . the large amount of fusion events that occur during development, growth and repair of skeletal muscle make it a suitable tissue for studies aiming to identify the genes and mechanisms that underpin the somatic cell fusion process.

research findings from drosophila have highlighted that key events in the muscle cell fusion process are cell-cell attraction, adhesion and subsequent actin nucleation at sites of cell-cell adhesion, the latter enabling membrane fusion . a wide variety of genes impact on the muscle cell fusion process ranging from actin nucleation factors, such as those found in the actin related protein 2/ <dig> complex  <cit> , to type  <dig> transmembrane receptors  <cit> . of particular interest to this research paper has been the discovery of two paralogus type  <dig> transmembrane receptors and members of the immunoglobulin  superfamily kirre  <cit>  and rst  <cit> . loss of both kirre and rst from the drosophila genome results in muscle cell fusion inhibition  <cit> .

present within the human genome are three kirre homologs termed kin of irre like   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . this family of genes have also been referred to in the literature as the neph family, neph <dig> , neph <dig> , and neph <dig>  <cit> . kirrel <dig> has been implicated in diverse functions including pontine nuclei formation in the developing brain  <cit>  male-male aggressive behaviour  <cit>  and inhibition of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation  <cit> . notably, no detailed investigation has been performed on any of the kirrel family members and their presence in human skeletal muscle. of particular interest to this research paper is the kirrel <dig> gene as murine kirrel <dig> has been reported to be present in the kidney  <cit> , brain  <cit>  and also in cultured stromal cells  <cit> , yet, results from mrna analysis of murine skeletal muscle suggest that kirrel <dig> is absent  <cit> . however, a different study reported kirrel <dig> immunoreactivity in lysates obtained from mouse skeletal muscle  <cit> . these conflicting reports on kirrel <dig> in mammalian skeletal muscle merit further investigation.

our primary aim was to assess whether kirrel <dig> is present in uninjured and regenerating human skeletal muscle following mild damage-inducing exercises such as plyometric jumping and downhill running. presence of kirrel <dig> in the afore mentioned samples would raise questions about its function in skeletal muscle. currently nothing is known about kirrel <dig> in this tissue, or if it is indeed present in adult human skeletal muscle. while its presence alone would not confirm a role in the human muscle cell fusion process, it would provide initial support for further investigation. it is possible that it could mirror the role of kirre, its drosophila homolog, in regulating myoblast fusion events in adult human muscle.

our research findings demonstrate that at least three alternative splice variants of kirrel <dig> are present in adult human skeletal muscle. two of these splice variants have not been previously reported in the published literature. detection of kirrel <dig> mrna in adult human skeletal muscle using standard pcr was sporadic with occasional detection in uninjured and regenerating skeletal muscle samples. semi nested pcr increased the detection rate. such sporadic detection, using standard pcr assessment, demonstrates that in adult human skeletal muscle kirrel <dig> mrna is present at very low levels. at the protein level, kirrel <dig> immunoreactive proteins in uninjured and regenerating adult human skeletal muscle were observed. further work is now required in order to ascertain the function of all kirrel <dig> splice variants in human skeletal muscle and to provide more insight into stimuli promoting its expression and its subsequent post-transcriptional regulation.

RESULTS
analysis of the national centre for biotechnology  gene database highlighted the presence of two human kirrel <dig> reference sequences nm_ <dig>   containing  <dig> nucleotides and nm_ <dig>   containing  <dig> nucleotides. aligning kirrel <dig> a and b mrna transcripts to the human genome via dna sequence present in the genomic contig nt_ <dig> , demonstrated that kirrel <dig> a has  <dig> exons while b has  <dig> exons . of particular note in both transcripts was the very large first intron which spanned approximately  <dig> kilo bases . both transcripts are predicted to start their translation initiation in their first exons. the first  <dig> nucleotides of kirrel <dig> a and b are identical. this region spans exons 1- <dig> of kirrel <dig> a. subsequently kirrel <dig> a has a splice site that is not present in b thus resulting in exon  <dig> of kirrel <dig> b containing an additional  <dig> nucleotides. the predicted stop codon  in kirrel <dig> b is  <dig> nucleotides 3′ to the missed splice site. in comparison to kirrel <dig> b, kirrel <dig> a has an additional  <dig> exons totalling  <dig> nucleotides 3′ to the missed spliced site. the stop codon  for kirrel <dig> a is located in exon its 17th exon  <dig> nucleotides 3′ to the missed spliced site in b. the 3′ untranslated regions of kirrel <dig> a and b are  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides respectively.figure  <dig>

in silico analysis of kirrel <dig> protein domains
kirrel <dig> a is the larger of the two kirrel <dig> proteins with  <dig> amino acids  while kirrel <dig> b has  <dig> aa. the first  <dig> aa of kirrel <dig> a and b are identical. domains predicted within this region  are a signal peptide , five extracellular ig domains  and a transmembrane domain . five putative n-linked glycosylation sites  are predicted to be present in the extracellular domain of both kirrel <dig> proteins. the intracellular domain of kirrel <dig> a is predicted to contain an amphysisin sh <dig> binding domain . also present at its c-terminal end is a post synaptic density protein  <dig>  drosophila discs large tumour suppressor, zonula occludens  binding domain corresponding to the amino acids thv  <cit> . kirrel <dig> b is not predicted to contain either of the afore mentioned intracellular domains.

analysis of mrna
to assess for the presence of kirrel <dig> a and b mrna in adult human skeletal muscle, gene specific primers were designed. we initially investigated kirrel <dig> mrna expression in adult human male skeletal muscle biopsies obtained pre and  <dig> and 24 hr post a plyometric jumping exercise in order to assess for kirrel <dig> in uninjured and mildly injured skeletal muscle. the plyometric jumping protocol used here has previously been demonstrated to induce mild muscle damage  <cit> . kirrel <dig> has previously been reported to be present in the mouse brain  <cit>  and for the current study human astrocytes were used as a positive control for kirrel <dig> mrna expression.

primer set  <dig> was specific to kirrel <dig> a with a forward primer targeting exon  <dig> and a reverse primer targeting exon  <dig> of kirrel <dig> a . the expected amplicon is  <dig> nucleotides. two distinct amplicons migrating at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides were detected in the biopsy taken from subject  <dig> at 24 hr post plyometric exercise . in contrast, only the approximately  <dig> nucleotide amplicon was detectable in the biopsy sample that was taken at the 4 hr post plyometric exercise time point from the same subject . no biopsy from subject  <dig> presented with either the approximately  <dig> or  <dig> nucleotide amplicon. subject  <dig> had the approximately  <dig> nucleotide amplicon present at the baseline time point, but not at 4 hr or 24 hr post plyometric exercise . the quality of cdna template in all human skeletal muscle samples  was confirmed as satisfactory via assessing for gapdh mrna expression . a semi nested pcr was performed with primer sets  <dig> and  <dig> to assess if this approach would yield more consistent kirrel <dig> mrna detection. primer set  <dig> contained a forward primer that was targeted towards exon  <dig> of kirrel <dig> a with the reverse primer being the same as in primer set  <dig> . three samples from subject  <dig> were negative for all amplicons in the first analysis. however, in one of these an amplicon of approximately  <dig> nucleotides was detected at the 4 hr time point using the semi-nested pcr . in human astrocytes two amplicons were observed with primer set  <dig> at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides  thus matching those observed in human skeletal muscle. a much fainter amplicon was also detected in astrocytes at approximately  <dig> nucleotides . we also analysed mrna extracted from biopsies obtained from a previous study by our research group that investigated the effects of downhill running on skeletal muscle  <cit> . in some of these samples, an amplicon was detected that matched of the approximate  <dig> nucleotide amplicon observed in astrocytes .figure  <dig>

all three differently sized amplicons detected in adult human skeletal muscle samples were excised from the gel and sequenced. aligning the sequence data obtained from the approximately  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide sized amplicons to the human genome via the basic local alignment search tool  demonstrated that they were all variants of kirrel <dig> . the approximately  <dig> nucleotide amplicon corresponded to a known sequence present in kirrel <dig> a. the  <dig> nucleotide containing exon  <dig> of kirrel <dig> a was spliced out of the approximately  <dig> nucleotide amplicon. analysis of the approximate  <dig> nucleotide amplicon sequence highlighted the presence of an additional exon of  <dig> nucleotides between exon  <dig> and  <dig> of kirrel3a. this novel exon is located approximately  <dig> nucleotides 3′ to exon  <dig> of kirrel <dig> a and  <dig> nucleotides 5′ to exon  <dig> of kirrel <dig> a.table  <dig>

amplicons correspond to those shown in figure 2a and b. these sequences were blasted against the human genome via blast available at the ncbi to confirm their identity as kirrel <dig> splice variants.



subsequently it was of interest to ascertain whether kirrel <dig> b mrna was present in adult human skeletal muscle and astrocytes. the same samples as those from the plyometric jumping exercise intervention were assessed for kirrel <dig> b mrna using primer set  <dig> that contained the same forward primer as primer set  <dig> and a reverse primer targeted towards a kirrel <dig> b specific sequence present in its 14th exon. the predicted amplicon was  <dig> nucleotides. no amplicon was detectable in adult human skeletal muscle samples from either the plyometric jumping protocol  or the downhill running samples , however, two amplicons migrating at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides were detected in astrocytes . both amplicons were excised from the gel and sequenced. the amplicon migrating at approximately  <dig> nucleotide corresponded to kirrel <dig> b while the amplicon that migrated at approximately  <dig> nucleotides lacked the 13th exon of kirrel <dig> b which contains  <dig> nucleotides .figure  <dig>

analysis of protein
based on results obtained from our mrna analysis we wished to investigate kirrel <dig> protein presence in human skeletal muscle samples. a commercially available antibody that was raised against the intracellular aa 596- <dig> of kirrel <dig> a was utilised. lysates obtained from a previous downhill run  study by our group  <cit>  were utilised for the analysis. baseline,  <dig> and 2 days post dhr were the time points assessed. multiple immunoreactive proteins were detected in all human skeletal muscle samples ranging in size from approximately 45-110 kda . to assess for kirrel <dig> specificity of the antibody, a blocking peptide was incubated with the antibody prior to addition to the membrane. the immunoreactive proteins observed at approximately 50-100 kda with antibody alone were eliminated , thus providing support that these immunoreactive proteins may be isoforms of kirrel <dig>  to confirm the protein presence of kirrel <dig> a second commercially available antibody that was raised against a recombinant human kirrel <dig> protein  was tested on a selection of lysates from the downhill running study. immunoreactive proteins were detected at approximately 70- <dig> kda while no immunoreactive proteins were detected at approximately 50- <dig> kda and  <dig> , which is in contrast to results obtained with the intracellular targeting antibody.figure  <dig>

discussion
skeletal muscle is made up of multinucleated cells . the drosophila homolog of kirrel <dig>  kirre is involved in enabling muscle cell fusion events. hence, kirrel <dig> may be a putative muscle cell fusion regulator in humans. there is currently no published data available regarding kirrel <dig> in adult human skeletal muscle. therefore, the primary aim of this research was to assess for the presence of kirrel <dig> in adult human skeletal muscle. by using pcr and transcript sequencing, we provide the first evidence that three alternatively spliced kirrel <dig> mrna transcripts are present in adult human skeletal muscle. results from western blot analysis provide support for the presence of kirrel <dig> protein in adult human skeletal muscle.

the mrna data highlight that in adult human skeletal muscle kirrel <dig> mrna expression levels are very low and that using standard pcr may result in false negatives. a nested pcr approach yielded a higher rate of kirrel <dig> detection. it will be of interest for future studies to examine kirrel <dig> mrna expression in a model that is known to include a large amount of myogenesis such as can be seen in some muscle pathologies. primary human myoblast cell cultures would provide a useful system to further investigate kirrel <dig> and ascertain its importance to human muscle cell fusion. murine proprioceptive neurons have been reported to express kirrel <dig>  <cit> , therefore their contribution to kirrel <dig> mrna expression in adult human skeletal muscle should also be investigated.

the physical process of transcribing kirrel <dig> can be regarded as a specialised event because, compared to the vast majority of other genes within the human genome, kirrel <dig> spans a very large genomic region of approximately 580kb. such a long genome span is likely to impact on the rate of kirrel <dig> mrna transcript production. rna polymerase ii has been reported to be capable of transcribing large human genes at a rate of approximately 4 kb-min  <cit> . this rate of transcription suggests that production of kirrel <dig> mrna transcripts would take approximately 145 minutes. previously produced transcripts are likely to be translated or degraded within the time period required to produce a kirrel <dig> mrna transcript. such a time frame may result in a pulsatile occurrence of kirrel <dig> mrna in adult human skeletal muscle, unless kirrel <dig> is being continually transcribed. such a scenario may help explain the apparent discrepancy between the mrna results in relation to kirrel <dig> protein that was detectable in all biopsy samples analysed from both pre and post the dhr exercise intervention. interestingly, our findings in relation to human kirrel <dig> are largely in agreement with two different mouse studies focussing specifically on kirrel <dig>  in the first study, mrna has been reported to be absent from mouse skeletal muscle  <cit> , while the second study reported strong protein detection of kirrel <dig> in mouse skeletal muscle  <cit> .

results from our western blot experiments varied depending on the commercial antibody being used. each antibody targeted different epitopes with one being extracellular and the other intracellular. the fact two immunoreactive proteins that migrated at approximately  <dig> and 75 kda were detected by both antibodies, appears to support that these are kirrel  <dig> proteins rather than breakdown products. however, the predicted molecular weight of kirrel3a is 85 kda therefore the kirrel proteins within the 70 kda range are likely to be one or two of the other kirrel <dig> splice variants present in human skeletal muscle. it is possible that they represent one splice variant with the larger having undergone post-translational modification. immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis will be useful in determining the identity of these immunoreactive proteins.

the proteins detected at  <dig> and 55 kda were detected only when using the kirrel <dig> antibody targeting the intracellular domain. this antibody may be recognising partially degraded kirrel <dig> proteins or these could be alternative truncated isoforms.

for analysis of mrna, our primers were directed towards the 3′ end region of kirrel <dig>  and we can only speculate on whether or not alternative splicing may occur further downstream towards the 5′ end  that would produce even smaller kirrel <dig> protein isoforms. if alternative splicing occurs at the 5′ end this could explain why the extracellular targeting antibody did not detect proteins of similar size as those detected by the intracellular targeting antibody. in future, we suggest that 5′ race experiments should be performed to provide useful information in evaluating this possibility.

our rationale for investigating kirrel <dig> in human skeletal muscle was derived from research studies in drosophila that demonstrated the involvement of two genes, kirre and rst, in the muscle cell fusion process during embryonic development  <cit> . while our research findings do not prove a role for kirrel <dig> in the cell fusion process in adult human muscle, they do raise interesting questions regarding the function of kirrel <dig> in human myogenesis and even in uninjured human skeletal muscle fibres. murine kirrel <dig> is present in stromal cells  <cit>  and co-culture studies of kirrel <dig> expressing stromal with hematopoietic stem cells, demonstrated a role for the extracellular domain of kirrel <dig> in inhibiting hematopoietic stem cells’ differentiation  <cit> . such a finding is particularly notable since adult human skeletal muscle also contains stem cells termed satellite cells  <cit> . satellite cells, located within the space between the basal lamina and plasma membrane of skeletal muscle fibres, are kept in an undifferentiated state until activated by events such as muscle damage  <cit> . it will therefore be of future interest to ascertain whether kirrel <dig> may be involved in regulating satellite cell differentiation in human skeletal muscle.

in vitro, the extracellular domain of kirrel <dig> is capable of binding to the extracellular domain of nephrin, a type  <dig> transmembrane protein and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily  <cit> . nephrin is the mammalian homolog to the drosophila gene, sticks and stones, that is essential for the muscle cell fusion process during embryonic fly development  <cit> . considering that a significant body of evidence has emerged describing similarities in cellular processes between fly and man  <cit>  it is tempting to hypothesise that interaction of kirrel <dig> and nephrin in human skeletal muscle may facilitate the muscle cell fusion process. indeed, in a small mammal model, nephrin-/- murine myoblasts displayed reduced fusion capabilities during in vitro myogenesis  <cit> .

kirrel <dig> is part of the kirrel gene family that contains another two structurally similar members: kirrel and kirrel <dig>  <cit> . in drosophila redundancy is present between kirre and rst with regard to the muscle cell fusion process  <cit>  and redundancy may also be present among the kirrel family members for the muscle cell fusion process in humans. such redundancy should be considered when attempting to ascertain the possible roles of the kirrel family members in the human muscle cell fusion process. in vitro primary myoblast culture studies should be fruitful in this regard.

the splice variants, kirrel <dig> a and b, that are present in adult human skeletal muscle and/or astrocytes are predicted to contain significantly different cytoplasmic domains. kirrel <dig> a, but not kirrel <dig> b, is predicted to contain a sh <dig> amphysisin binding domain and also a pdz binding domain. such differences are likely to result in the two isoforms having divergent functions. amphysisin is a protein whose function is not completely understood, however, it is highly concentrated at nerve terminals  <cit> . the c-elegans homolog of kirrel <dig>  is located at synapses  <cit>  and hence, amphysisin binding may regulate kirrel <dig> a presence at neural synapses or neuromuscular junctions.

the pdz binding domain present in kirrel <dig> a may confer kirrel <dig> with the ability to alter the polarity of the cell in which it is expressed as the pdz binding domain of human kirrel <dig> is capable of binding to the cell polarity protein partitioning defective  <dig>   <cit> . satellite cells require pard <dig> function in order to achieve asymmetric cell division  <cit> . the asymmetric cell division of satellite cells enables diversity that is thought to be important in the maintenance of the satellite cell pool. a subset of satellite cells in injured skeletal muscle are highly proliferative while another subset of cells retains the ability to return to quiescence  <cit> . it will therefore be of future interest to ascertain whether kirrel <dig> is present in satellite cells and if so, whether it regulates asymmetric division via its interaction with pard <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate for the first time that there are at least  <dig> splice variants of kirrel <dig> present in adult human skeletal muscle, two of which have never previously been identified in human muscle. importantly, mrna of all splice variants was not always present, a finding with potential physiological relevance. these initial discoveries highlight the need for more molecular and functional studies. full length sequence information should be obtained on all kirrel <dig> mrna transcripts in order to predict the translated kirrel <dig> proteins. physiological studies should be done to confirm involvement in fusion, or not. production of isoform specific anti kirrel <dig> antibodies will enable identification of the cellular localisation of the different kirrel <dig> isoforms. obtaining such information will aid in our understanding of kirrel <dig> and its function in human skeletal muscle.
