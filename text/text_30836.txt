BACKGROUND
cartilaginous fishes  provide
a notable example of successful evolutionary perseverance, with a fossil record
extending to at least the lower devonian over  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . given their extraordinary evolutionary history and basal phylogenetic
origin relative to other jawed vertebrates, chondrichthyians have been proposed as
an important comparative model for understanding vertebrate genome evolution in
general and various specific evolutionary and mechanistic aspects of vertebrate
development, physiology and immune function  <cit> .

one group of chondrichthyians, the modern sharks , comprise
over  <dig> extant species displaying an impressive diversity of form and function,
including a broad spectrum of sizes , functional
morphologies ,
physiology , reproduction  and habitat use . sharks have also become a major target of human exploitation for their fins  <cit> , resulting in widespread concerns that their rapidly declining
populations coupled with unique life history characteristics will not permit
recovery if ongoing exploitation rates continue. 

despite representing a major vertebrate lineage of evolutionary uniqueness and ecological and conservation
importance, sharks remain the least explored vertebrate group at the genome level.
the handful of genome level studies conducted on sharks have already revealed some
distinctive features, including the absence of the hoxc cluster of
developmental pattern genes found in all other non-elasmobranch vertebrate lineages  <cit> , and the presence of a substantial number of expressed sequence tags for
which no homologues in other organisms could be identified  <cit> . these apparent distinctions hint that other genomic novelties are
possible in this lineage and await discovery.

the white shark, carcharodon carcharias , a large apex predator,
is one of the highest-profile marine species, capturing extraordinary attention from
the public and media. although it demonstrates a cosmopolitan distribution, the
species is believed to have a low abundance throughout its range, leading to
international concerns about its conservation  in the face of known market utilization for its body parts and widespread
shark overfishing practices  <cit> . arguably, the white shark may be a “poster child” for
marine, large animal conservation attention. the white shark also possesses some
notable physical and physiological characteristics that make it an interesting
biological study, including an estimated genome size  nearly
twice that of humans, large adult sizes reaching up to ~ <dig> m in length, a thermal
regulatory capability uncommon in fishes, a slow reproductive cycle with oophagous
embryos, extensive migratory capabilities, and an ability to utilize a wide thermal
niche including diving to near  <dig> m depths  <cit> .

despite the high public profile of white sharks, their serious conservation needs,
and their noteworthy evolutionary and life-history characteristics, this species is
still largely uncharacterized at the molecular level, and no genomics resources for
it exist. given the white shark’s rather large genome size, a transcriptome
characterization using next-generation sequencing technology provides a tractable
entry into providing the first genomic view and genome resource for this remarkable
species. however, obtaining white shark tissue is extremely difficult ,
and as a consequence our study was restricted to one tissue type  from one
individual. this precluded examination of expression differences among tissue types,
and we acknowledge the obvious limitation of a single transcriptome that may not be
typical of the species.

typically, de-novo transcriptomes for non-model organisms where no reference
genome exists have been obtained using roche  <dig> pyrosequencing technology because
of the generation of longer sequencing reads e.g.  <cit> . however, recent advances in de-novo assembly for shorter
illumina reads are now making this approach a more viable alternative  <cit> . in addition, some workers have combined both approaches e.g.  <cit> , and here we adopt this latter approach for deriving the first
transcriptome dataset for the white shark. specifically, illumina reads were aligned
to  <dig> contigs to produce a 454/illumina consensus sequence. by utilizing the
strengths of both sequencing technologies, this approach yielded a considerable
increase  in transcriptome annotation when compared to  <dig> alone. we
utilize this sequence dataset to provide a general characterization of the heart
transcriptome with regards to gene discovery and annotation, identification and
characterization of multiple microsatellite markers, and detection of genes under
positive selection.

RESULTS
assembly
roche  <dig> sequencing of the white shark heart cdna produced  <dig>  reads ranging
in size from 100- <dig> bp  for a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp. the
de-novo assembly produced  <dig>  contigs  ranging in
size from 101– <dig>  bp, with a mean of  <dig> bp. the distribution of the
number of reads per contig was as follows:  <dig>  contigs  =  <dig> read
,  <dig>  contigs  = 2– <dig> reads,  <dig>  contigs 
= 6– <dig> reads, and  <dig>  contigs  > <dig> reads . the
illumina hiseq run produced  <dig> , <dig>  <dig> bp reads. aligning these data to the
 <dig> contigs produced  <dig>  454/illumina consensus sequences . a total of  <dig>   of the
consensus sequences contained an orf of  <dig> amino acids or longer. of the 454
contigs lacking a 454/illumina consensus sequence,  <dig>   were
non-singletons and  <dig>  contained an orf of  <dig> amino acids or longer. these
orfs were combined with the  <dig>  orfs obtained from the consensus sequences
resulting in a total of  <dig>  orfs that were subsequently annotated. for
purposes of quantitative evaluation of our combined 454/illumina approach , we also processed
the  <dig> data exclusively. non-singleton  <dig> contigs  contained  <dig> 
orfs of  <dig> amino acids or longer . the  <dig> and illumina derived short
read files were deposited in the sequence read archive at ncbi under the study
accession number srp <dig>  the  <dig> contigs, 454/illumina consensus sequences,
and 454/illumina consensus orfs  are included as additional files
 <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively.

for a  <dig> contig, if there were nucleotide sites lacking consensus with illumina
data , the consensus sequence would contain ns
at the relevant positions. this in turn would lead to xs  in the subsequent translated orf. the  <dig>  orfs generated from
the  <dig>  consensus sequences contained  <dig> , <dig> amino acids  including
 <dig>  xs . to place this apparent loss of aa data in perspective,
the  <dig>  orfs generated from the  <dig> data alone, contained  <dig> ,487aa.
therefore, despite the ~10% loss of aa data in the consensus approach, we
were still able to generate  <dig> , <dig> more aa data, an increase of approximately
one third, using the combined platform approach.

lengths of orfs generated using 454/illumina consensus sequences and  <dig> data
exclusively, showed in general, similar distributions . a noticeable difference, however, was an increase in the
number of shorter orfs  for the consensus data. the number
of shorter reads for the consensus data could be even higher as some consensus
sequence orfs contained x homopolymers at their 3′ end that might have
masked a stop codon, which may in turn have erroneously increased the orf
length. therefore, the length comparison was also performed excluding xs in the
consensus sequence orfs . mean orf lengths
were as follows:  <dig> only =  <dig> aa, consensus =  <dig> aa, consensus 
=  <dig> aa. the higher mean for the  <dig> orfs most likely reflects the exclusion of
singletons, which ranged in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp .
sequences  and  <dig> data exclusively . red
bars show distribution for consensus orfs with unspecified or unknown
amino acids  removed .

annotation and comparative gene ontology
the orf annotation was performed by searching the swiss-prot database using
blast2go  <cit> , and a total of  <dig>  consensus orfs  had blast hits with
the database, with  <dig>   of these receiving annotation with gene
ontology  terms . in
comparison,  <dig>  454-derived orfs  had blast hits with the
swiss-prot database, with  <dig>   annotated with go terms . consequently, although the mean
orf length for the consensus data was lower, there was a considerable increase
in the number of annotated orfs obtained , highlighting
the improvement gained when  <dig> and illumina data are combined.

the orfs were also annotated with go-slim terms using the generic go slim
. go
slim is a reduced version of the full go that contains a sub-set of more general
go terms and excludes the more fine-grained specific terms. this approach
provides a broad overview of the ontology and gene product functions for genomic
data. the genome sequence of the zebrafish  is perhaps the
most extensively studied of all fishes; consequently, its corresponding
transcriptome sequence data should be the most complete for a fish and thus
provide an appropriate evolutionary model for comparative characterization of
the white shark transcriptome. however, the white shark also possesses certain
endothermic capabilities more characteristic of mammals  <cit> ; therefore, we compared the proportion of the white shark  <dig> 
consensus orfs assigned to each go slim term to the proportion of zebrafish and
human transcripts assigned to each go slim term . distributions
showed generally similar proportions of go term assignments for each species,
suggesting that we obtained a good representation of the heart transcriptome for
the white shark. closer inspection of the go term proportions in the biological
process domain  showed that the white shark heart
transcriptome had the highest proportion of genes for most of the  <dig> metabolic
process terms, with the zebrafish having the lowest. fisher tests showed
virtually all of these higher white shark proportions to be statistically
significant . although this comparison is tempered by
the fact that the shark transcriptome was derived exclusively from heart tissue
and may already be enriched for metabolism relative to the complete
transcriptome, it opens the possibility that some aspects of white shark
metabolism, at least at the level of gene expression, might be more similar to
that of a mammal than to that of an ectothermic teleost. the comparison is
tempered because for each term, the fisher test compares the relative proportion
of genes assigned and not assigned the term between a particular species pair
. consequently, the
relative proportion of genes assigned a term for the white shark might have been
inflated because transcripts derived from other tissue types were absent.
although somewhat speculative, without a complete white shark transcriptome,
this apparent higher gene proportion in metabolic process terms compared to
zebrafish might be explained partly by the fact that the white shark is not a
true poikilotherm. the white shark is among a very small group of fishes that
have the ability to physiologically regulate their body temperature and maintain
a substantially higher temperature than ambient seawater  <cit> , which in turn is associated with elevated metabolic rates and
aerobic and anaerobic capacities  <cit> .

for the molecular function domain , comparison to
the zebrafish showed  <dig>  go terms to be significantly enriched  in the white shark,
whereas comparison to human showed  <dig>  terms to be enriched. there were
 <dig> terms enriched in the zebrafish comparison that were not enriched in the
human comparison. in general, these enriched terms described ion/nucleic
acid/rna binding, and enzyme/peptidase/nuclease/hydrolase/electron carrier
activity. in turn, there were nine terms enriched in the human comparison that
were not enriched in the comparison to zebrafish. in general, these terms
described
pyrophosphatase/phosphotransferase/hydrolase/nucleoside/transferase/kinase
activity. while many of these enzymatic terms are likely involved in metabolic
processes, two terms for the zebrafish comparison are perhaps particularly
noteworthy: electron carrier and peptidase activity. enrichment in these may
again reflect the endothermic nature of the white shark. for example, electron
carrier term enrichment suggests elevated oxidative metabolism, which is
consistent with the increased energetic needs of an endothermic physiology, a
continuous swimming lifestyle  and the very long distance migratory capability of white
sharks  <cit> . enrichment for the peptidase activity term suggests increased
digestive rates in white sharks, consistent with previous hypotheses of this
capability based on the elevated temperatures observed in the stomach and other
viscera of white sharks  <cit> .

the cellular component domain  describes where a
gene product is active; and a notably large number of go terms in this domain
were enriched for the white shark: 56% were enriched compared to human and
77% were enriched compared to zebrafish. this unexpectedly large difference
in go term enrichment in the white shark - zebrafish comparison compared to the
white shark - human comparison also hints at the possibility that a component of
the white shark transcriptome may be more similar to human than zebrafish.
similarities between another chondrichthyian and humans were also apparent in
the genome sequence comparisons of venkatesh et al.  <cit> , in which the elephant shark 
surprisingly shared a higher degree of gene synteny and more conserved
non-coding elements  with humans than with either the zebrafish or puffer
fish .

microsatellites
roche  <dig> sequencing has become an effective alternative to established protocols
for the isolation of microsatellite markers  <cit> , and this approach is increasingly being used to develop such markers
for teleost fishes of economic and conservation interest  <cit> . the use of this technology is in its infancy for sharks, with three
reports thus far  <cit> , all of which were based on  <dig> genome shotgun sequencing. here, we
provide the results of the first transcriptome based discovery of microsatellite
markers and their distributional characteristics in an elasmobranch. of the
 <dig>  contigs derived from the  <dig> white shark data,  <dig>  
contained one or more dinucleotide, trinucleotide, or tetranucleotide
microsatellites of five perfect repeats or more. in total, we detected  <dig> 
microsatellites with the following motifs: di =  <dig>  , tri = 864
, tetra =  <dig> . the maximum number of repeats for each motif
was: di =  <dig> , tri =  <dig> , tetra =  <dig> .
see additional file  <dig> for a description of the
microsatellites. of the  <dig>  contigs containing a microsatellite,  <dig> were
singletons with no consensus sequence. of the remaining  <dig>  contigs, 762
 lacked an open reading frame and were therefore possibly non-coding
transcripts or transcript fragments. the remaining  <dig>  contigs 
contained one or more microstatellites within the orf, 5′ untranslated
region, and 3′ untranslated region. the proportion of microstatellites
within the orfs and untranslated regions  was approximately equal  . a small proportion of microstatellites 
straddled the orf and utrs.
frames  and untranslated regions . red and purple
sections show the proportions for a small number of microsatellites that
straddled  the 5’ end of the orf and 5’ utr and  the
3’ end of the orf and 3’ utr.

the proportion of di, tri, and tetranucleotide repeat motifs within the orfs,
5′ and 3′ utrs, and putative non-coding transcripts are shown in
figure  <dig>  the vast majority of motifs in all
transcript types and regions were dinucleotides .
the only published microsatellites to date from white sharks are also
dinucleotides, and were isolated using total genomic dna and conventional
enrichment protocols  <cit> . a majority of dinucleotide repeat microsatellite motifs were also
found in the three shark species 
subject to whole genome  <dig> sequence analysis  <cit> , hinting that a high frequency of dinucleotides may be a general
feature of shark genomes. in the white shark, the frequency of repeat motifs
within annotated orfs showed a similar strong bias for dinucleotides . our finding that dinucleotides
were the most frequent repeat motif in white shark transcripts irrespective of
transcript region is typical for a wide range of taxonomic groups including
other vertebrates  <cit> . however, when toth et al.  <cit>  only considered exons, trinucleotide repeats were found to be the
most frequent. this finding contrasts sharply with that for the white shark
where orfs were strongly dominated by dinucleotide repeats. another fish, the
teleost f. rubripes, is a partial exception to the trend of high
frequency of trinucleotides in vertebrate coding regions. for example, when
repeat motifs of one through eight within orfs were examined in fugu
rubripes, dinucleotides occurred in almost equal proportions to
trinucleotides   <cit> . while the teleost proportions appear to be the most similar to the
white shark , the white shark remains the most distinctive
due to its high proportion of dinucleotides relative to trinucleotides within
orfs.
microsatellite repeat motifs within the orfs, 5’ and 3’
utrs, and putative non-coding transcripts.

expansion of trinucleotide repeats within orfs has been implicated in human
neurodegenerative disorders and some cancers  <cit> . notably, elasmobranchs allegedly have the lowest incidence of
malignant neoplasia  of any vertebrate group  <cit> , although this claim remains controversial due to a lack of
sufficient study  <cit> . if further studies demonstrate that elasmobranchs do indeed have a
lower susceptibility to cancer, the relatively lower proportion of trinucleotide
microsatellite repeats within orfs, as seen here for the white shark, may
provide a genetic mechanism hypothesis for further exploration.

there were  <dig>  orfs that contained one or more microsatellite . of these,  <dig>  orfs contained one or more
dinucleotide repeat,  <dig> orfs contained one or more trinucleotide repeat, and 14
orfs contained one or more tetranucleotide repeat. a total of  <dig>  of
these microsatellite-containing orfs were annotated . for these orfs, we investigated whether any of
the go terms assigned to them, appeared in significantly higher proportions
 compared to the remainder of the
transcriptome’s non-microsatellite containing orfs. for orfs containing
dinucleotide or tetranucleotide repeats, a fisher test showed that no go term
was significantly enriched . for orfs containing
trinucleotide repeats, however, terms within the molecular function domain
 and
cellular component domain  were significantly enriched.

the molecular function domain enriched terms described gene products that 
interacted selectively and non-covalently with nucleic acids, and 
interacted selectively and non-covalently with specific dna sequences in order
to modulate transcription. these results suggest that white shark orfs
containing trinucleotide repeats may have regulatory roles involved in the
control of transcription .

previous studies have shown that certain types of trinucleotide repeat, coding
for specific amino acid homopolymers, have specific functions. for example,
poly-glutamic acid homopolymers are common in nuclear localization signal
proteins  <cit>  and have been implicated in transcription activation/de-activation  <cit> , whereas proline homopolymers may provide a domain for dna binding
and affect protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in general, the white shark was concordant with these findings, as
the most frequent amino acid homopolymers within orfs for the enriched nucleic
acid/dna binding go term were poly-glutamic acid , poly-aspartic acid
, and poly-proline  .
there was a similar pattern for the enriched transcription factor/regulator
activity go term with poly-glutamic acid  and poly-proline
 being the most frequent . the
white shark was distinctive however, in that there was a large proportion of
poly-aspartic acid homopolymers within orfs with regulatory roles .
enriched nucleic acid/dna binding go term,  the enriched
transcription factor/regulator activity go term.

finally, the large pool of microsatellites discovered here provides the potential
to greatly expand the limited microsatellite marker resources available for this
vulnerable species. to this end and as part of a separate study, we are
developing microsatellite pcr primers on a global set of white shark fin tissue
samples. to date, we have tested  <dig> loci . of these,  <dig> are scorable , suggesting
good prospects for the development of additional loci .

positive selection
we searched the white shark transcriptome for genes showing signs of positive
selection by comparing it to embryo transcriptomes of two additional
elasmobranch species: scyliorhinus canicular  and
leucoraja erinacea . for each of the three species,
we tested each species’ lineage for positive selection using the
branch-site test as implemented in paml  <cit> . before correction for multiple testing, there were ten, three, and
five genes on the white shark, cat shark, and skate lineages respectively that
had significant results for positive selection . after correction , four white shark genes remained significant: un <dig> , un <dig> ,
un <dig> , and un <dig> . none of the cat shark or skate genes remained significant after
correction for multiple testing.

in yeast, tip <dig> indirectly regulates cell growth by regulating sit4
 activity  <cit> . more specifically, when nutrients such as nitrogen or carbon are
abundant, the rapamycin-sensitive tor signaling pathway promotes binding of the
inhibitor protein tap <dig> to sit <dig> thereby inhibiting its activity. however, when
nutrients are low, tor does not promote binding of tap <dig> and the inhibitor
disassociates from sit <dig> and tip <dig> binds to the inhibitor, which in turn permits
sit <dig> activity. the regulatory role of protein phosphatases is debated in the
literature, and they may function to both up and down regulate cell growth  <cit> . furthermore, given the important role of these enzymes in cell
growth, they have been actively studied by cancer researchers, with some studies
suggesting that they might possess tumor suppressive capabilities  <cit> . however, other studies have emphasized their requirement for active
cell growth and survival  <cit> . nevertheless, the finding here of positive selection for a white
shark gene involved in their regulation warrants further investigation given 
an apparent low incidence of malignant tumors reported for elasmobranchs  <cit> ,  the high levels of nitrogen  in shark tissue, and 
the unique ability of elasmobranchs when compared to higher vertebrates to
regenerate kidney tissue  <cit> .

mediator of rna polymerase ii transcription subunit  <dig> is a component of the
mediator complex. this large multi protein complex, which is conserved among
eukaryotes, binds rna polymerase ii and regulates transcription of class ii
genes  <cit> . in addition to controlling cell growth, the tor signaling pathway
has also been implicated in the regulation of transcription. for example, in
yeast, tor limits transcription when nitrogen levels are low  <cit> . perhaps the elevated level of urea in shark tissue is a factor
contributing to positive selection for the mediator subunit  <dig> 

using blast2go, we were able to assign go terms to three of the genes showing
signs of positive selection   . montoya-burgos  <cit>  compared go terms enriched for genes under positive selection among
two teleosts and six eutherian mammals . comparison of these
results to the go terms for the white shark genes under positive selection is
shown in table  <dig>  similarities were regulation of
transcription for the biological process domain and protein binding for the
molecular function domain. a notable difference, however, was the complete
absence of biological process response terms for the white shark . in contrast, multiple response terms were shared between
the teleosts and mammals . furthermore, numerous studies involving
a variety of additional teleosts have reported detection of positive selection
for genes involved in stress and immune system response  <cit> . elasmobranchs are the most primitive jawed vertebrate to possess an
adaptive immune system based on immunoglobulins, t cell receptors, and major
histocompatibility complex molecules . however, this system is
genetically distinct from the higher vertebrates  <cit>  and has a restricted antibody response when compared to teleosts and
mammals  <cit> . the lack of positive selection for genes involved in immune and
defense response reported here for three elasmobranch species might in part
reflect this elasmobranch immune system distinctiveness.

CONCLUSIONS
utilizing an approach that combined roche  <dig> and illumina sequencing technologies,
we assembled and characterized the first white shark transcriptome. this combined
approach yielded a considerable improvement over roche  <dig> technology alone,
generating  <dig>  annotated transcripts. the white shark transcriptome is a valuable
resource that adds to the currently nascent field of cartilaginous fish genomics and
provides a reference for characterization of genomic datasets from other
elasmobranchs, which we anticipate will emerge with increasing frequency. this
resource also provides the first large-scale view of the gene content of a major
marine apex predator that displays a collection of remarkable physical,
physiological, and behavioral properties. of particular interest is the observation
that the proportion of annotated transcripts involved in metabolic processes was
more similar between the white shark and humans than between the white shark and a
teleost, a finding consistent with those of venkatesh et al.  <cit>  who found genomic non-coding elements and the relative position of genes
to be more similar between another cartilaginous fish  and
humans than between the elephant shark and a teleost. we also compared the white
shark transcriptome to other available elasmobranch sequences, for signatures of
positive selection and identified several genes of putative adaptive significance on
the white shark lineage. the transcriptome resource also provides a large set of new
microsatellites that will be immediately useful as markers in studies of population
structure, dispersal dynamics, genetic diversity, and mating system biology to
further the conservation and management of this vulnerable species.
