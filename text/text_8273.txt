BACKGROUND
seuss  is a member of a family of transcriptional co-regulators that controls a diversity of developmental events in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . seu is required for repression of agamous during floral organ identity specification. the seu protein has been shown to physically interact with members of the mads domain homeobox transcription factor family as well as other transcriptional co-regulators  and leunig_homologue  <cit> ). these protein interactions mediate repression of ag transcription through the recruitment of a histone deacetylase protein, as well as components of the mediator complex  <cit> . these data taken together support a model in which seu functions as a bridging protein that enables the recruitment of lug and associated histone deacetylase activities by dna binding proteins of the mads domain family. in this model seu is required for repression of ag in floral whorls that will give rise to perianth organs where these protein complexes are most active  <cit> .

seu and lug are also required for development of the medial domain of the gynoecium  <cit> . the medial domain of the arabidopsis gynoecium contains the carpel margin meristem, a vital meristem that gives rise to the ovules and other tissues required for female reproductive competence. the effect of seu or lug single mutants on medial domain development is relatively mild, however both seu and lug single mutants display a dramatic synergistic interaction with aintegumenta  mutants. in seu ant or lug ant double mutants development of the gynoecial medial domain is greatly disrupted resulting in the loss of ovule primordia. these results suggest that seu and lug participate with ant in gene regulation events that are required for the development of the medial gynoecial domain.

ant encodes a dna binding transcription factor of the ap <dig> gene family that functions during organogenesis  <cit> . ant potentiates organ growth by engendering a competence for cellular divisions during organ development  <cit> . the ant single mutants display fewer and smaller lateral organs in both vegetative and reproductive parts of the plant as well as alterations in the development of the ovule integuments  <cit> . the integuments are layers of cells that later form into the seed coat. in the ant single mutant both the inner and outer integuments fail to develop properly. seu and lug also play a role in the development of the ovule integuments  <cit> . however, the seu and lug single mutants display a relatively mild disruption of ovule integument development that is incompletely penetrant.

brassinosteroid hormones are a class of plant hormones that play a role in a wide variety of developmental processes  <cit> . the two main active brassinosteriod hormones in arabidopsis are castasterone  and brassinolide . the synthesis of these two hormones in arabidopsis requires a cytochrome p <dig> -type enzyme, cyp85a <dig>  that is rate-limiting for the conversion of 6-deoxycs to cs and cs to bl  <cit> . however, the phenotype of the cyp85a <dig> mutant is much less severe than that of the brassinosteroid insensitive bri <dig> mutant  <cit> . this is due in part to the partially redundant activity of a paralogous cytochrome p <dig> enzyme, cyp85a <dig>  and by the presence of cyp85a-independant pathways for the production of cs  <cit> .

here we report synergistic genetic interactions between mutations in the cyp85a <dig> gene and seu mutants that affect the development of the gynoecial medial domain and the development of the ovule outer integument. we identified a cyp85a <dig> mutant allele, termed seuss-modifier  <dig> , in a screen for genetic enhancers of the seu gynoecial phenotype. map-based cloning efforts and complementation tests demonstrated that sum <dig> is allelic with existing cyp85a <dig> alleles. the seu cyp85a <dig> double mutants generated in either a col- <dig> or ler background displayed enhanced disruptions of gynoecial and ovule development. our results highlight a previously undocumented sensitivity of the seu mutants to the reductions in the activity of the brassinosteriod synthesis pathway. this work also points to a role for brassinosteriod hormones in ovule outer integument and gynoecial medial domain development.

RESULTS
the seu- <dig> mutant allele conditions a weak organ identity transformation phenotype that results from the ectopic expression of ag  <cit> . the seu- <dig> mutant also conditions slight splitting of the gynoecial tube and a partially penetrant ovule outer integument defect . the gynoecial and ovule defects of the seu- <dig> single mutant result in a slight reduction in seed set and gynoecial length . we mutagenized seu- <dig> seeds and visually screened the m <dig> generation for second site mutations that enhanced the sterility and gynoecial splitting of the seu- <dig> mutant . we uncovered eleven seuss-modifier  mutations that enhanced the seu- <dig> phenotype. we focused our initial efforts on sum <dig> as it showed a synergistic genetic interaction with seu with respect to gynoecial development and female fertility.

molecular identification and phenotypic analysis of sum <dig> single mutants
in order to better characterize the sum <dig> single mutant phenotype in a wild type background, the seu sum  <dig> double mutant identified in the screen was backcrossed to the ler parental ecotype three times and sum <dig> single mutant lines were isolated. the sum <dig> single mutants conditioned a moderate reduction in plant height as well as alterations in rosette leaf development . rosette leaves of the sum <dig> single mutant were darker green and rounder in shape when compared to wild type leaves. the morphology of the sum <dig> flower was similar to wild type except that the stamens were shorter than wild type . this resulted in a slightly reduced ability of the sum <dig> flower to self fertilize.

we also generated a f <dig> mapping population by crossing the seu sum <dig> double mutant  to wild type col- <dig> plants. the sum <dig> mutation was rough mapped to an interval of chromosome iii between ciw <dig> and t32n <dig>  that included the cyp85a <dig>  gene. comparison of the sum <dig> single mutant phenotype to the published phenotype for loss-of-function alleles of cyp85a <dig> suggested that sum <dig> might be allelic with cyp85a <dig>  <cit> . we compared the sequence of the cyp85a <dig> genomic dna from ler and sum <dig> individuals in an effort to identify the sequence alteration underlying the sum <dig> allele. we successfully amplified and sequenced the first  <dig> nucleotides of the cyp85a <dig> gene sequence  as well as a 3' portion of the cyp85a <dig> gene from position + <dig> into the 3'untranslated region . we found no changes in the sequence of these regions in the sum <dig> mutant relative to the sequences we derived from ler dna. however, we were unable to amplify the intervening portions of the cyp85a <dig> gene from the sum <dig> mutants, while these same regions were successfully amplified from ler individuals. furthermore, oligonucleotide primers that spanned the intermediate region  also failed to generate amplicons from the sum <dig> genomic dna. these results suggested the presence of a genomic rearrangement in sum <dig> individuals that disrupts the cyp85a <dig> gene sequence. complementation tests between the sum <dig> allele and the previously characterized cyp85a2- <dig> and cyp85a2- <dig> alleles  <cit>  revealed that sum <dig> was allelic with these cyp85a <dig> alleles . thus we have renamed the sum <dig> allele cyp85a2- <dig> . characterization of the t-dna insertion sites in cyp85a2- <dig> and cyp85a2- <dig> individuals confirmed disruption of this gene in these lines . the cyp85a2- <dig> allele has been previously reported as a null allele based on a failure to detect transcript in rt pcr assays  <cit> . the phenotypes of the cyp85a2- <dig>  cyp85a2- <dig> and cyp85a2- <dig> alleles are similar suggesting that they are all strong loss-of-function alleles .

ยง this allele  has been designated cyp85a2- <dig> by nomura et al.,  <dig>  the allele designated cyp85a2- <dig> in kim et al.,  <dig> is a different allele  that was designated cyp85a2- <dig> by nomura et al.

the seu cyp85a <dig> double mutant conditions enhanced disruptions of gynoecial and ovule development
to further characterize the seu cyp85a <dig> double mutant phenotype we created and analyzed the following double mutants: seu- <dig> cyp85a2- <dig>  seu- <dig> cyp85a2- <dig>  and seu- <dig> cyp85a2- <dig> . we did not detect an enhancement of the homeotic transformations previously reported for the seu- <dig> allele  <cit>  in the seu cyp85a <dig> double mutants. however, all three seu cyp85a <dig> double mutant combinations displayed enhanced defects in ovule and gynoecial development. double mutants conditioned enhanced splitting of the apex of the gynoecium relative to the single mutants . the cyp85a <dig> single mutants did not display splitting of the gynoecial apex and splitting in the seu single mutant was mild and rarely observed in the early arising flowers. in contrast, the gynoecial apex in the seu cyp85a <dig> double mutants was nearly always split and extended horn like protrusions of the valves were observed. the splitting of the apex and the horn-like protrusions may be the result of a reduction in the growth of the medial domain of the gynoecium. analysis of earlier stage gynoecia indicate that even as early as floral stage  <dig> or  <dig>  <cit>  the medial domain of the gynoecium appears retarded in its growth relative to the lateral or valve domains . the seu cyp85a <dig> double mutants also display a significant reduction in the number of ovule primordia initiated relative to wild type and either single mutant . kim et al. have previously reported that over-expression of cyp85a <dig> conditions an increased number of seeds per silique, further suggesting a role for cyp85a <dig> in the development of ovules from the gynoecial medial domain  <cit> .

the seu cyp85a <dig> double mutants also conditioned an extreme loss of fertility as these double mutants did not generate viable seeds upon self-fertilization. our analysis of ovule defects indicated the ovule developmental defects of the double mutant were enhanced relative to either single mutant. the double mutant ovules displayed a reduced growth of the outer integument relative to either single mutant . in severe cases the outer integument failed to develop, resulting in a somewhat orthotropic ovule morphology . although brassinolide has not previously been reported to play a role in outer integument development, the double mutant phenotype suggests a requirement for the cyp85a <dig> gene for outer integument development in the seu mutant background. it is likely that the loss of seu sensitizes the ovule to disruptions in the levels of brassinolide.

we also noted defects in the development of the female gametophytes within the seu cyp85a <dig> ovules . often the female gametophyte was missing or failed to reach a mature morphology with a recognizable set of gametophyte cells. as we did not observe segregation distortion with these alleles, it is most likely that the defects in female gametophyte development are an indirect result of the development of the sporophytic tissue of the ovule and not due to a requirement for seu and cyp85a <dig> activity in the female gametophyte directly.

levels of cyp85a <dig> transcript are reduced in seuss mutant inflorescence samples
we examined the steady state levels of transcript accumulation for the cyp85a <dig> and seu transcripts in wt , seu- <dig> and cyp85a2- <dig> mutant inflorescences. in the seu- <dig> mutant tissue the level of the cyp85a <dig> transcript was significantly less  than that detected in wild type inflorescence samples . these data suggest that seu activity may be required for wild type levels of cyp85a <dig> transcript accumulation in the inflorescence. no statistically significant difference in the expression of seu transcript was detected between the wild type and the cyp85a <dig> inflorescences tested. thus cyp85a <dig> does not appear to be required for expression of the seu transcript. the cyp85a2- <dig> allele has been previously reported as a null allele, yet we detected a low level of expression of the cyp85a <dig> transcript in the cyp85a2- <dig> inflorescences. however, the cyp85a2- <dig> allele is still likely a null or near null allele based on the site of the t-dna insertion that is expected to truncate the cyp85a <dig> protein product after just  <dig> amino acids. thus it seems unlikely that the synergistic enhancement of the seu cyp85a <dig> double mutants is entirely conditioned by a seu-mutant dependant reduction of cyp85a <dig> transcript.

we propose that additional genes are misregulated in the seu mutant background and that these disrupted gene regulation events contribute to the phenotypic enhancement. we speculate that these genes might lie in the brassinosteroid synthesis pathway or might lie in parallel pathways that support common cellular responses  in the ovule or the gynoecial medial domain. seu is required for proper response to the phytohormone auxin and altered auxin signaling may in part condition the disruption of gynoecium medial domain development seen in seu ant double mutants  <cit> . given the extensive overlap of brassinosteroid-responsive and auxin-responsive genes and the documented requirement of brassinosteroids for transcriptional responses to auxin  <cit> , it is possible that the enhanced seu cyp85a <dig> double mutant phenotypes result from the combined weakening of brassinosteroid- and auxin-dependant signaling pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
our screen for second site genetic modifiers of the seu mutant gynoecial and ovule phenotypes has identified cyp85a <dig> as a genetic enhancer of the seu mutant. these results suggest that brassinolide hormones play a previously unappreciated role in the development of the outer integument of the ovule and the gynoecial medial domain. they also suggest that loss of seu activity may sensitize ovule and gynoecial development to the loss of brassinosteroid hormones. the seu mutant background thus may represent a sensitized genetic background to identify additional regulators of gynoecial and ovule function.
