BACKGROUND
many tissues exhibit the capacity for renewal after trauma, disease or aging because of dormant stem cell reservoirs. different types of stem cells have been described within the adult bone marrow including haematopoietic  <cit>  and colony forming units-fibroblast-like-cells  <cit> , later termed bone marrow stromal cells  <cit>  which have been found to differentiate along multiple mesenchymal lineages  <cit> . other sources of adult stem cells have recently been characterized, suggesting that stem cells capable of multilineage differentiation might reside in any post-natal organ  <cit> . however, their multilineage potential has often been considered to represent heterogenic cell isolates  <cit> .

three criteria have been chosen to define mesenchymal stromal cells  <cit> . first, the cells are plastic adherent and second, they express the cd marker molecules cd <dig> , cd <dig>  as well as cd <dig>  and do not express the leukocyte marker molecule cd <dig> and the marker molecule cd <dig> for primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells. however, current studies demonstrated that mesenchymal stromal cells cannot be distinguished from fibroblasts by flow cytometry analysis using a panel of common marker molecules  <cit> . therefore, the third criterium plays a pivotal role: mesenchymal stromal cells must show the multilineage capacity to differentiate into adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic cells.

it is well known, that isolation and proliferation as well as in vitro-differentiation tests of adult stem and progenitor cells are time consuming and therefore not easily applicable in clinical protocols. two different strategies have been suggested to overcome this problem. first, autologous reparative cells can be guided directly in vivo to a defect by exogenous factors. for example, an orthopaedic method using a collagen i/iii-matrix to recruit mesenchymal stem cells from the subchondral bone to a cartilage lesion after microfracture has been developed  <cit> . however, using this strategy under clinical conditions it remains unclear whether defined populations of stem/progenitor cells migrate to the defect. for this purpose, in vitro cultivation procedures have to be optimized to establish time-sparing protocols before defined human stem/progenitor cells can be used for regeneration of different organs in clinical settings. one goal of this strategy is to reduce the amount of the cells used for assessing the differentiation capacity. therefore, we introduced the mesenchymal microsphere  cultivation system and tested the differentiation of plastic adherent cells from different sources, namely murine perirenal adipose tissue , murine mediastinal stromal tissue  and murine bone marrow . the proliferating cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting  using a panel of common marker molecules  <cit>  and in the first instance by the performance of classical differentiation protocols  <cit> .

the new mms protocol was established on the basis of the "hanging drop" procedure used for embryonic stem cell differentiation and enables the analysis of aggregates containing the same cell number. using the mms as well as classical protocols we were able to demonstrate efficient multilineage differentiation of the isolated mesenchymal progenitor cells. an advantage though of the mms protocol is the significant lower amount of cells needed for the differentiation test in vitro.

RESULTS
successful establishment of mesenchymal progenitor cell populations from different murine tissues
plastic adherent cell populations from bm, pat and mst, obtained from nmri mice, exhibited a typical spindle-shaped morphology . isolation of murine progenitor cells from bm proved to be more difficult than from pat and mst, since 80% of the bm isolates failed to persist in passaged cell cultures. however, two weeks after isolation in 20% of the bm isolates the predominant cell type changed and was replaced by a population of rapidly proliferating spindle shaped cells . in contrast, pat and mst isolates displayed stable growth properties, with almost 100% successful rate of progenitor cell isolation.

optimizing the cell culture for all murine progenitor cell isolates, ideal cell growth and maintenance was achieved using an initial cell concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per cm <dig>  all progenitor cell populations expanded in vitro and maintained stable growth properties in cell culture. daily population doubling indices of all isolates were in the same range . isolates cultivated for up to  <dig> passages did not show lack of proliferation after passaging or cryopreservation and did not show obvious chromosomal and karyotype abnormalities as indicated by sporadic samples for g- and c-banding . in higher passages  the cells stopped proliferating.

phenotypic heterogeneity of murine progenitor cells analyzed by flow cytometry
to characterize the isolated mesenchymal progenitor cell populations, cd surface antigen marker expression was analyzed by means of flow cytometric measurement . murine bm, pat, and mst cell isolates were negative for cd <dig>  and cd <dig> , indicating that they were not of hematopoietic origin . while all murine progenitor cell isolates displayed high degrees of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  they showed differences in cd <dig> , cd49d , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd140b  and oct 3/ <dig> . taken together, only mst isolates did not meet the minimal criteria of mesenchymal stromal cells  <cit>  regarding marker molecule expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> 

chondrogenic differentiation of murine progenitor cells via micro mass body  and mesenchymal microsphere  cultivation
differentiation of murine mesenchymal progenitor cells along the chondrogenic lineage using the classical mmb and new mms protocol  was shown by ab staining . all mmbs and mms cultured in chondrogenic medium stained positive for ab after  <dig> days of cultivation. murine progenitor cell isolates from the three different sources displayed a comparable increase in the number of ab positive cells during further mms and mmb cultivation . after plating mms grow out and vary in shape. while bm isolates often form nodular structures, pat and mst outgrowths show a plane morphology.

rt-pcr analysis and immunostaining confirmed chondrogenic differentiation using the mms method . rt-pcr analysis for expression of chondrogenic marker genes demonstrated that all progenitor cell isolates expressed collagen type ii as well as the associated transcription factor sox <dig> during mms differentiation . in particular, in bm isolates sox <dig> : p ≤  <dig> ) and collagen type ii were up-regulated during chondrogenic differentiation, whereas sox <dig> was continuously expressed in mms derived from pat  and mst  isolates. however, collagen type ii was also up-regulated in pat : p ≤  <dig> ) and mst isolates after induction of chondrogenesis. immunostaining demonstrated that mms from all isolates  were positive for collagen type ii and collagen type x at the end of a  <dig> day induction period. taken together, these results demonstrate that all analyzed murine progenitor cell isolates were able to differentiate into the chondrogenic lineage using the mms differentiation method.

osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of murine progenitor cells via monolayer and mesenchymal microsphere  cultivation
to assess the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity of the analyzed murine adult mesenchymal progenitor cells, they were cultured in induction media as a monolayer  <cit>  in comparison to three-dimensional mms and characterized by histochemical staining . both, monolayer and mms cultivation resulted in adipogenic  and osteogenic  differentiation of all analyzed murine progenitor cells. while mms outgrowths derived from bm isolates showed a more nodular shape, the pat and mst grow out plane.

differentiation of monolayer cultivated bm, pat, and mst progenitor cells with adipogenic induction medium resulted in a time-dependent increase of sudan iii positive droplets up to  <dig> d  and monolayer cultivation in osteo-inductive medium resulted in the appearance of ap positive cells .

similarly, in all mms from bm, pat and mst an increasing number of adipogenic lipid-laden cells up to  <dig> d  and an increasing number of ap positive cells could be detected during differentiation .

when cultured via mms, progenitor cells displayed changes in the differentiation efficiency which has not been observed in monolayer experiments. cells from bm, pat and mst differentiated via mms into the adipogenic direction showed an almost two-fold increase in lipid-laden cells compared to monolayer cultivation. for example, approximately 80% of the mms outgrowths derived from pat stained positive for sudan iii after adipogenic induction for  <dig> days in contrast to 50% of the monolayer . likewise, the induction of bm and mst derived progenitor cells along the adipogenic lineage, resulted in a significant increase in lipid laden cells in comparison to monolayer culture . also osteogenic differentiation via mms was enhanced in comparison to monolayer cultivation .

when cultivated via mms, pat derived progenitor cells differentiated into adipogenic cells prior to lineage specific induction, which could not be observed in monolayer experiments : p ≤  <dig> ). similar observations were made during mms differentiation of cells from bm and mst into the osteogenic direction, demonstrating a higher number of ap positive cells prior to osteogenic induction : p ≤  <dig> ; 6b <dig> mst : p ≤  <dig> ).

confirmation of osteogenic and adipogenic progenitor cell differentiation via mms by rt-pcr and fluorescent immunostaining
to confirm the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of adult murine mesenchymal progenitor cells using the mms protocol, we performed rt-pcr, analysing the expression of adipogenic and osteogenic marker genes.

rt-pcr analysis of osteogenic marker genes showed that osteopontin was either expressed at a continuous level or up-regulated during mms differentiation . the expression of osteocalcin was initially up-regulated in bm , pat : p ≤  <dig> ) and mst : p ≤  <dig> ) derived cells and continuously expressed during later stages of osteogenic differentiation. immunostaining confirmed the expression of the osteogenic marker proteins bone sialoprotein and osteopontin in mms . both proteins could be detected as early as  <dig> days post induction  and were still expressed after  <dig> days of mms cultivation.

adipogenic induction of murine progenitor cells differentiated via the mms protocol resulted in lineage-specific gene expression of marker molecules such as adipsin, ap <dig> and transcription factor pparγ . when cultivated via mms, bm and pat derived cells expressed transcription factor pparγ at a basal level prior to lineage specific induction . up-regulation of pparγ in bm and pat isolates was coherent with an increase in ap2-expression : p ≤  <dig> ; b <dig> pat : p ≤  <dig> ). murine mst derived progenitor cells also displayed an up-regulation of ap <dig> and a stable expression level of pparγ . adipsin, known to be a marker of mature adipocytes, was found to be expressed as early as day  <dig> in pat  and continuously from the 18th day of adipogenic differentiation via mms in all analyzed progenitor populations . taken together, these results demonstrate that all analyzed murine progenitor cell isolates were able to differentiate into the adipogenic and osteogenic lineage using the mms differentiation method.

comparison of cell numbers required for differentiation
to test the multilineage differentiation capacity of mesenchymal progenitor cells, we suggest a simple assay consisting of the characterization of adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation at a single time point after application of specific induction media . according to our experience at least rt-pcr analysis and histochemical staining should be performed to get a reliable conclusion about the differentiation state of the cells.

accepted that  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> are used for classical monolayer cultivation the following cell numbers are necessary to start adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation:   <dig>  cells for rna isolation  on two  <dig> mm-plastic culture dishes  and   <dig>  cells for histochemical staining  on  <dig> wells of one 2-well chamber slide . accepted that  <dig>  cells/mmb are used to perform classical chondrogenic differentiation,  <dig> . <dig> cells are utilized for  rna isolation  plus  histochemical staining . however, it has to be kept in mind that the generation of only one mmb for ab staining implies the high risk of loosing the sample due to technical problems during processing.

in fact, the introduction of the mms method resulted in a significant decrease in the consumption of mesenchymal progenitor cells for testing the differentiation capacity in our experiments. to give an example, we again assume that the above mentioned simple screening test for differentiation is performed. accepted that  <dig>  cells/mms are used the following cell numbers are now necessary to start differentiation:  for histocemical staining  <dig>  cells .   <dig>  cells are spent for rna isolation .

taken together, in comparison to the new mms method around  <dig> times more cells are wasted using the classical differentiation protocols. again assuming that the above suggested screening assay is performed, in total  <dig> . <dig> cells  and, respectively  <dig>  cells  are needed to start the differentiation. moreover, the mms cultivation resulted in comparable contents of rna during adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation in comparison to monolayer cultivation . although fewer cells are initially applied, chondrogenic differentiation via mms resulted in a significant increase in the content of rna in comparison to mmb cultivation. finally, to give an idea about the time-saving effect of mms cultivation, for example, in our experiments  <dig> . <dig> cells were obtained in passage  <dig>  whereas  <dig>  cells could already be generated in passage  <dig> 

discussion
it has been suggested that stem/progenitor cells capable of multilineage differentiation are distributed throughout the body  <cit> . we characterized plastic adherent murine cells from retroperitoneal pat and thoracic mst as new tissue sources of mesenchymal progenitor cells and introduced the three-dimensional mesenchymal microsphere method for in vitro differentiation of stem/progenitor cells.

it is well accepted that adult stem cell isolation by classical protocols yields a heterogeneous population of stem/progenitor cells  <cit> . the frequency of colony forming unit-fibroblast among commonly used strains of mice has been observed to be highly variable  <cit> . due to the low frequency of bone marrow derived stem cells their isolation has been an ongoing challenge  <cit> . in our study, 20% of the bone marrow isolates persisted in cell culture and demonstrated stable growth kinetics. in contrast, plastic adherent cells derived from pat and mst demonstrated almost 100% successful isolates. irregular anatomical distribution, donor variations and differences in sampling methods of stem/progenitor cells could influence the yield  <cit> . it has been suggested that initial plating densities ranging from 2- <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig>  <cit>  have a profound influence on stem/progenitor cell growth  <cit> . to standardize monolayer cultivation, we used a plating density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/cm <dig> for cells derived from pat, mst, and bm. providing these conditions, cell isolates showed stable growth kinetics as demonstrated by a stable population doubling index. no obvious chromosomal aberrations were observed in sporadic samples for g- and c-banding. however, this karyotype analysis was not done systematically. therefore, predominantly for higher passages of murine cells the possibility of chromosomal instabilities cannot be completely excluded.

it has been demonstrated that adult stem/progenitor cells express a panel of surface marker molecules  <cit> . in accordance with these observations we now show that all pat, mst, and bm cell isolates were negative for cd <dig> and cd <dig>  but expressed cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  however, we observed that the expression of surface marker molecules differed among plastic adherent cells from different murine tissues. murine mst-derived cells did not express cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd140b, while pat and bm cell isolates expressed these markers. furthermore, cd <dig> and oct 3/ <dig> were only expressed by pat-derived progenitor cells. thus, most of the analyzed marker molecules, characteristic for mesenchymal stem cells, were expressed by the pat-derived cells. but both, bm and pat isolates achieved the expression profile postulated by the current minimal criteria for mesenchymal stromal cells  <cit> . the expression of cd <dig>  cd49d, and cd <dig>  or lack thereof, has been a source of discrepancies in previous studies  <cit> . taken together, the characterization by flow cytometry indicates that the analyzed cell isolates do not represent a homogeneous mesenchymal progenitor cell population. in addition, all isolates showed a fibroblastoid shape, but mst cells were larger. however, application of specific induction media following classical differentiation protocols resulted in an efficient differentiation of all isolates into the adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lineage.

the expression of oct 3/ <dig> is regulated during embryonic development, reflecting a role in specification and maintenance of pluripotent stem cells  <cit> . in accordance with our observations, it has been demonstrated that oct 3/ <dig> is expressed in adult stem/progenitor cell isolates  <cit>  and in differentiated cell types  <cit> . in line with recently published results  <cit>  we are reluctant to conclude that the expression of oct 3/ <dig> among a heterogeneous population of adult stem cells is indicative of pluripotency. nevertheless, expression of this marker might indicate a more pronounced differentiation potency. this agrees with our observation that pat-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells, which expressed oct <dig>  showed a higher differentiation capacity.

johnstone et al.  <cit>  introduced a three-dimensional model of mmb cultivation to assess chondrogenesis in vitro. attempts to initiate chondrogenesis in monolayer cultures under otherwise similar conditions have failed  <cit> . the pellet culture format enables stem/progenitor cells to assume a close contact without spreading on a growth surface. in line with this, we predominantly found expression of cartilage matrix molecules in the centre of the mms rather than in the outgrowing areas. we demonstrated chondrogenic differentiation via mmb as well as mms for pat, mst, and bm isolates. however, the classical mmb cultivation procedure takes a large amount of progenitor cells  for differentiation and even classical adipogenic and osteogenic monolayer differentiation is often cell-consuming. thus, considering the application of human stem/progenitor cells in medicine less cells can be provided for clinical application. moreover, passaging for the generation of large amounts of cells results in a time delay prior to cell therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
we introduced the mms method to enable three-dimensional cell-cell-interactions during adipogenic and osteogenic progenitor cell differentiation using standardized conditions. mms cultivation appears to improve the adipogenic differentiation capacity of pat, mst and bm isolates and increased the yield of osteogenic cell differentiation in comparison to monolayer cultivation. moreover, chondrogenic differentiation can also be analyzed using the mms system. taken together, we showed that the mms system is feasible to test the in vitro differentiation capacity of plastic adherent cells. the main advantage of the mms model system in this context is that only small amounts of mesenchymal progenitor cells are needed for testing differentiation. this cell-saving effect of the mms model may result in less time consumption caused by the in vitro differentiation assay required prior to any clinical application of human stem/progenitor cells. recently, the capability to form cellular aggregates has also been shown for human mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> . therefore, mms cultivation might be a useful tool to save human stem/progenitor cells for clinical application while testing their differentiation capacity.
