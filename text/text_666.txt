BACKGROUND
papaya, carica papaya l., is a fast-growing fruit crop grown in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. papaya fruit is among the most nutritious available. it is rich in vitamins a and c, and has been recommended for prevention of vitamin a deficiency in tropical and subtropical developing countries  <cit> . in addition to fresh fruit production, papaya is grown for papain, a proteolytic enzyme widely used in food processing, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and leather industries, as well as medical applications  <cit> .

the majority of flowering plants, unlike most animal species that produce unisexual individuals, produce 'perfect' flowers that contain both male and female organs. it has been reported that only 6% of  <dig>  angiosperm species are dioecious, i.e. having male and female individuals  <cit> . papaya is one of the rare species classified as trioecious because its individuals exist as one of three sex types – female, male, or hermaphrodite. sex determination in papaya is controlled by a pair of recently evolved sex chromosomes with the genotype xx for female, xy for male, and xyh for hermaphrodite  <cit> . the difference between x and y  chromosomes is a small non-recombination region, which is called the male-specific region of the y chromosome . the y and yh originated from an ancestral y chromosome about  <dig>  years ago and share  <dig> % dna sequence identity in the msy  <cit> . the physical size of the msy is about  <dig> mbp and accounts for only about 13% of the papaya y chromosome  <cit> . papaya is an excellent system in which to study the early events of sex chromosome evolution.

papaya originated in central america where it was domesticated by aboriginals in this region  <cit> . hermaphrodite papaya trees are self-pollinated and hermaphrodite cultivars are in production in most papaya growing regions for the obvious reason that every hermaphrodite tree produces fruit. nevertheless, dioecious cultivars are used in india, australia, and south africa to assure greater fruit production under cool winter temperatures. the first transgenic papaya cultivar sunup is derived from hermaphrodite solo cultivar sunset that has undergone more than  <dig> generations of self pollination  <cit> . the genomic dna of hermaphrodite 'sunup', that contains the x and yh chromosomes, was used for construction of a papaya bacterial artificial chromosome  library  <cit> , whereas a 'sunup' female with xx chromosomes was used for whole genome shotgun sequencing to avoid the complication of assembling the heterozygous region of the x and yh chromosomes  <cit> .

papaya belongs to the small family caricacea and is in the order brassicales. papaya and arabidopsis diverged from a common ancestor about  <dig> million years ago. thus, papaya can serve as an outgroup for comparative study of brassicaceae genomes. papaya has a small genome of  <dig> mbp with nine pairs of chromosomes, a short juvenile phase of 3– <dig> months, and a short generation time of 9– <dig> months. papaya is one of the few fruit tree crops that can flower and fruit throughout the year, providing a constant supply of flower buds and fruits. each mature fruit contains 800– <dig> seeds, and a single f <dig> tree could produce a large segregating f <dig> population for genetic studies. clonal propagation can be done easily from cuttings or through micro-propagation. an efficient transformation system has been established as demonstrated by the success of transgenic papaya that saved the hawaiian papaya industry  <cit> . these attributes make papaya an excellent model system for tropical fruit trees in which to study a number of biological processes, including sex chromosome evolution  <cit> , cell wall biosynthesis and degradation  <cit> , vegetative/reproductive growth phase transition, flower development  <cit> , fruit development, fruit ripening, and post-harvesting physiology  <cit> .

significant progress has been made in recent years in developing genomic resources to expedite genome research in papaya. a bac library of 'sunup' hermaphrodite was constructed with  <dig> × genome equivalents, providing the foundation for studying papaya genome structure and organization  <cit> . bac ends of this library were sequenced  <cit> , providing the first glimpse of the sequence composition of the papaya genome. two high-density genetic linkage maps have been constructed  <cit> , providing essential tools for comparative genomic analysis, marker-assisted selection, and genomic dissection of complex traits. the first high-density genetic map of papaya was constructed with  <dig>  markers, including  <dig>  amplified fragment length polymorphism  markers,  <dig> morphological markers, and one transgenic marker  <cit> . although this map has high-density, it is not suitable for aligning papaya genome sequence to linkage groups and integrating genetic and physical maps due to the anonymous nature of aflp markers. to overcome this limitation, highly informative sequence-based simple sequence repeat  markers were used to construct the second high-density genetic map, containing  <dig> markers including  <dig> sequence-based ssr markers and one morphological marker  <cit> . these ssr markers were developed from either bac end or whole-genome shotgun sequence reads  <cit> , and this map is a crucial resource for integration of genetic and physical maps and the genome sequences.

several methods have been developed for construction of physical maps, including hybridization-based  <cit>  and fingerprinting-based methods  <cit> . fingerprinting techniques have been widely used in construction of genome-wide physical maps. a number of techniques have been developed to generate fingerprints including the traditional agarose-gel, acrylamide gel, and automated capillary sequencer-based high-information-content fingerprinting methods  <cit> . after comparatively evaluating five fingerprinting methods, it was concluded that the high-information-content fingerprinting method with five enzyme digestion and snapshot labeling developed by luo et al.  <cit>  is the most effective  <cit> . we report here the construction of a bac-based physical map of the papaya genome using high-information-content fingerprinting  <cit> . contigs on the physical map were aligned with the papaya genome sequence assembly through bac-end sequences .

RESULTS
fingerprinting and contig map assembly
the papaya bac library used for fingerprinting was constructed from hermaphrodite 'sunup', the original transgenic cultivar  <cit> . this bac library includes  <dig>  bac clones with the average insert size of  <dig> kb, providing  <dig> × papaya-genome equivalents. all  <dig>  bac clones were fingerprinted and the failed clones were repeated twice, obtaining successful fingerprints for  <dig>  bac clones . after excluding the clones with no or small inserts , and cross-contamination , the remaining  <dig>  fingerprints  were subjected to contig assembly using the fpc  program.

after automated overlap evaluation and manual review,  <dig>  bac clones were assembled into  <dig> contigs, while  <dig>  clones remained as singletons. the average number of fragments  of each clone was  <dig> . considering the clones with no or small inserts were excluded from contig assembly and the average insert size of the bac clones used for contig assembly should be higher than  <dig> kb, the bac clones mapped on contigs  represented at least  <dig> × genome equivalents of the papaya genome. a total of  <dig> contigs  contained more than  <dig> bac clones with a total of  <dig>  bac clones, accounting for  <dig> % of the mapped clones. on average, each contig contains  <dig>  bac clones. the longest contig contains  <dig> consensus bands, which is about  <dig> % of the total length of the fpc contigs http://www.stardaddy.uga.edu/fpc/webagcol/papaya/webfpc/. a summary of the papaya fpc map is shown in table  <dig> 

overgo and single-copy probe hybridization
a total of  <dig>  overgo probes representing conserved sequences in arabidopsis and genetically mapped brassica loci were tested against  <dig>  papaya bacs. a total of  <dig>  overgos  detected positive bacs in the papaya. after eliminating low quality data, the remaining  <dig>  overgos were anchored on the papaya fpc map. among these overgos,  <dig>  hit single contigs; the average number of clones per overgo is  <dig> .

sixteen probes representing single-copy loci of papaya were used to screen the papaya bac library. a total of  <dig> positive bac clones were obtained. these  <dig> single-copy probes were anchored on the fpc map. fifteen out of the  <dig> probes hit single contigs and only the probe of papaya pistillata  gene hit two contigs, ctg <dig> and ctg <dig>  the ctg <dig> contains only three clones and all of them are pi positive clones. thus, ctg <dig> should be part of the ctg <dig>  but the high stringency setting failed to merge them into a single contig. the probe of teta gene from the transformation vector  <cit>  was placed on ctg <dig>  the ctg <dig> contains  <dig> bac clones, while the total number of consensus bands  is only  <dig>  the detailed analysis of ctg <dig> is shown in the genome coverage section. most clones on ctg <dig> contain chloroplast sequences. we sequenced  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream of the flanking regions of teta insertion and the result showed that the  <dig> bp upstream fragment shared 98% identity with the papaya chloroplast genome  <cit> . we conclude that the teta probe was placed on ctg <dig> due to the border sequence sharing high similarity with the chloroplast genome.

bac end sequencing
the entire papaya bac library of  <dig>  bac clones was end-sequenced. after the first round sequencing, the failed clones were re-arrayed in 384-well plates and re-sequenced. a total of  <dig>  bac end sequences passed the filter after trimming the vector sequences and eliminating the clones with cross-well contamination. the total length of the trimmed sequences is  <dig> , <dig> bp, which accounts for 12% of the papaya genome. the average length of each read is  <dig>  bp and the g+c content of the bac end sequences is  <dig> %. paired ends from  <dig>  bac clones were used to build scaffolds for the whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly and provide anchor points for alignment of the fpc physical map with genome sequences and integration of the genetic and physical maps.

integration of physical map, genetic map, and genome sequence
the sequence-tagged ssr genetic map of papaya was used for integrating the genetic and physical maps with the genome sequences  <cit> . of the  <dig> mapped ssr markers,  <dig> were derived from bac end sequences ,  <dig> were designed from shotgun sequence reads, and  <dig> were developed from assembled shotgun contigs. the bes-derived ssrs directly anchored the fpc contigs to the genetic map. from the  <dig> bes-derived microsatellites,  <dig> fpc contigs containing  <dig>  consensus bands and  <dig> shotgun scaffolds covering  <dig> mb  were anchored to the genetic map. the  <dig>  paired bess were aligned to the shotgun scaffolds to extend the integrated map. the remaining  <dig> mapped microsatellites were positioned on shotgun scaffolds by blastn search. the bac clones with paired ends covering the mapped microsatellites were used as baits to search the fpc physical map to find the corresponding fpc contigs. the order and orientation of the fpc contigs were examined by aligning on the shotgun scaffolds. the integrated map was further extended with information from the shotgun scaffolds. additional bac clones on the anchored shotgun scaffolds were used to search the fpc map for extending the integrated map.

the initial integration was conducted by searching the shotgun sequence using bess of the bac clones containing the mapped microsatellites to place the shotgun scaffolds and fpc contigs on the genetic map. detailed information on the initial integration of linkage group  <dig>  is showed in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  among the  <dig> mapped ssrs on lg <dig>  four were not found in shotgun scaffolds, and three of the four ssrs were msy-linked, which are not in the female genome. three ssrs were found in the shotgun scaffolds, but no bac containing these ssrs was found. two fpc contigs that were placed on lg <dig> in the initial integrated map were also mapped onto other linkage groups and were thus removed from our final integrated map. we also used shotgun sequence scaffolds and fpc contigs to validate the initial integration. overlapping scaffolds and fpc contigs confirmed their order on the genetic map . for example, fpc contig  <dig> connected scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> on lg <dig>  fpc contig  <dig> corrected the genetic location of the three scaffolds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  eleven genetic loci that had been incorrectly mapped were identified and re-located. two potential scaffold merges, involving scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  and scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  were recognized. the validated map is shown in additional file  <dig>  the initial erroneously mapped genetic markers might be the result of segregation distortion and the limited number of individuals used for mapping.

in the final integrated map,  <dig>  fpc contigs containing  <dig>   bac clones and  <dig>  consensus bands were anchored on the genetic linkage map. a total of  <dig> shotgun scaffolds covering  <dig> mb were anchored to the genetic map. overall, 63% of the papaya genome sequences were placed on the genetic map.

both the fpc contigs and the shotgun scaffolds bridged the gap between linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> were merged based on fluorescence in situ hybridization   <cit> . the estimated physical size of each linkage group is based on the length of each linkage group in centimorgans. coverage of the integrated map on each linkage group is not even. linkage group 9+ <dig> showed the highest coverage. over 90% of this linkage group was covered by anchored shotgun scaffolds and almost 100% was covered by assigned fpc contigs. the least covered linkage group, lg <dig>  is the sex chromosome for which 13% is heterologous male specific region, covering only  <dig> % of the estimated physical size .

genome coverage
lengths of the fingerprinted contigs are presented as consensus band  units. to determine average band size and estimate the genome coverage of the fingerprinted physical map, we used information from the draft sequence of the papaya genome. twenty-two non-overlapping fingerprinted contigs were aligned to the shotgun assembly through bess . these  <dig> fpc contigs of  <dig>  cb units cover  <dig> , <dig> bp. we determined that the average band size in our papaya fpc map is about  <dig>  kb.

we investigated the organelle genome contamination in our fpc physical map to better estimate genome coverage. two dna probes containing sorghum chloroplast ropb and trnk genes were used to screen the 'sunup' hermaphrodite papaya bac library and a total of  <dig> positive bac clones were identified, with  <dig> identified by both probes. we searched for these  <dig> clones in the papaya fpc map and found  <dig> of these either formed singletons or were excluded from fpc map construction. among the remaining  <dig> clones,  <dig> were placed on contig  <dig>   <dig> on contig  <dig>  and  <dig> were distributed over  <dig> other contigs. the bac end sequences of the  <dig> positive bac clones were compared with the papaya chloroplast genome sequence  and  <dig> bac clones were identified as having both ends sharing over 90% identity with papaya chloroplast genome sequence. the insert sizes of these  <dig> bac clones were determined by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field  electrophoresis. twelve were confirmed to contain the chloroplast genome sequence by comparing their real measured sizes with the sizes derived from in silico analysis of their bess on the papaya chloroplast genome sequence. ten out of the  <dig> bacs were placed on contig  <dig> and the other two bacs were excluded from the fpc map.

the papaya mitochondrial genome sequence was used as a query to search the papaya bes database. a total of  <dig> bac clones was identified with at least one end sharing over 95% identity with the papaya mitochondrial genome sequence. among them,  <dig> bacs were verified with both ends containing the papaya mitochondrial genome sequences. among the  <dig> bacs,  <dig> either formed singletons or were excluded from fpc map construction,  <dig> were placed on contig  <dig>   <dig> on contig  <dig>   <dig> on contig  <dig>   <dig> on contig  <dig>   <dig> on contig  <dig>  and the rest were distributed on  <dig> other contigs.

the total length of the papaya fpc map is  <dig>  cb units and the average number of consensus bands of each contig is  <dig> . to estimate the genome coverage of this map, we excluded contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which were confirmed to contain papaya organelle genome sequences. the total length of the remaining contigs was  <dig>  cb units and  <dig>  mb  of the papaya genome was covered in these fpc contigs. based on these estimates, we calculated that  <dig>  mb  of the papaya genome was anchored to the genetic map .

genetic recombination
with the shotgun sequences and the fpc contigs both aligned on the genetic map, we examined the relationships between genetic distance and physical distance in the papaya genome. from the papaya genome size of  <dig> mb and the total genetic map length of  <dig>  cm, we calculated that the average physical distance per centimorgan of the papaya genome is about  <dig> kb. we aligned the fpc contigs on the genetic map . on the integrated map, the ratio between genetic and physical distance varies among chromosomes. recombination suppressed regions were observed near the center of all major linkage groups . hotspots of recombination were found on one end of linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

the longest linkage group, lg <dig>  contains the msy. we investigated the variation of the ratio between genetic and physical distance across lg <dig> . one region with severely suppressed recombination was shown on the center of lg <dig>  and this region is the msy. the recombination rates at the adjacent regions on both sides of the msy were gradually recovered as the distance to the msy increases; dramatically elevated at the locations about  <dig> mb away from the msy to 7-fold of the genome average; and then dropped again. based on our integrated map, this region covers about  <dig>  mb, which is about 17% of the shotgun sequence aligned on lg <dig>  since the shotgun sequence aligned the genetic map covered only  <dig> % of the entire lg <dig>  we estimated the size of the suppression region to be about 8– <dig> mb.

discussion
the sequenced papaya sunup genome is derived from inbred cultivar sunset with three transgenic insertions, and the papaya genome has no recent genome wide duplication except the ancient triplication event shared by most eudicots  <cit> . the genomic organization of papaya is therefore less complicated than that of arabidopsis, which has undergone two rounds of genome wide duplication; or the highly heterozygous poplar genome that has undergone one recent genome wide duplication. nevertheless, the integration of a bac-based physical map, genome sequence, and genetic map helped to correct errors and enhance the quality of these resources that are complementary to one another. integration of these three sets of genomic information provides a valuable resource for comparative genomics, particularly for those researchers who work on the brassicales  <cit> .

genome coverage and representation
the papaya genome size of  <dig> mb was estimated by flow cytometry  <cit> . the papaya draft genome sequence presented an opportunity to verify the genome size estimate by comparing the whole genome shotgun sequence to the fully assembled bac sequences. however, the only fully sequenced papaya bacs are those on the msy and its corresponding region of the x chromosome. since the female papaya genome was sequenced, comparison with the x-specific bacs is valid. two fully sequenced x bacs, 53e <dig> and 61h <dig>  consist of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively  <cit> . the whole genome shotgun  sequence matched  <dig> % of the combined  <dig>  bp bac sequences so that the genome size of papaya could be  <dig> mb based on the assembled  <dig> mb wgs sequence  <cit> . however, the msy of papaya is pericentromeric and even the x counterpart has more repetitive sequence than the genome average  <cit> , thus the wgs sequence could have been underrepresented in this region. for this reason, the original estimate of  <dig> mb might be closer to the actual genome size of papaya.

the papaya physical map was based on the patterns of fragments generated by restriction enzyme digestion. we used the high stringency setting to build up the contig map to minimize false end-merges. some ends of the contigs might overlap but failed to form larger contigs due to insufficient consensus bands for the high stringency of a minimum 70% overlapping bands. this could result in an overestimation of the genome coverage of the physical map. however, in our assembled fpc map,  <dig>  or 14% of clones remained as singletons and  <dig> % of the clones located on the small contigs . compared with the large contigs, singletons and small contigs may be more important for filling gaps in the physical map. our estimation of the coverage of the papaya physical map was based on the consensus bands and the singletons were not included. thus, while the genome coverage of the papaya physical map might be overestimated, the scale should be limited.

accuracy of the genome coverage estimate is also related to the number of contigs in the physical map. the physical map of populus consists of  <dig>  contigs, representing  <dig> × genome equivalents  <cit> . the total length of the estimated sizes of the fpc contigs is  <dig> mb, about 20% larger than the populus genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> . in addition to populus, overestimation of genome coverage was also found in the soybean physical map  <cit> . the soybean physical map consists of  <dig>  contigs due to the large number of chromosomes and its highly repetitive genome  <cit> . the total estimated length of contigs in the soybean physical map is  <dig>  mb, about  <dig> % larger than the soybean genome size of  <dig>  mb  <cit> . in contrast to the maps with large numbers of contigs, in arabidopsis,  <dig> contigs covered the entire genome except for the centromere, telomere, and nucleolus organization regions   <cit> . in rice,  <dig> contigs represent about  <dig> % of the rice genome  <cit> . papaya is a domesticated and inbreeding species and the estimated residual heterozygosity is only about  <dig> % for the sequenced gynodioecious cultivar sunup  <cit> . the physical map of the papaya genome consists of  <dig> contigs, which is about 1/ <dig> of the numbers of contigs in the populus and soybean physical maps. our estimate of the genome coverage of the papaya physical map might be close to the actual percentage.

the level of genome coverage of the physical map relies on the coverage of the underlying bac library. the bac library we used for construction of the papaya physical map included  <dig>  bac clones and provided  <dig> × genome equivalents. a bac library usually does not completely cover an entire genome due to non-random distribution of target restriction sites in certain regions of the genome. moreover, highly repetitive fragments, such as centromeres, telomeres, and nor regions, are under-represented in the bac libraries. in papaya, the highly repetitive msy is a good example of these difficult regions. extreme gene paucity and a high density of retroelements were observed in the papaya msy  <cit> . in our current physical map of the papaya msy in a separate project to study the evolution of sex chromosomes, the sunup hermaphrodite bac library contains nearly all of the 8– <dig> mb msy region . the physical map of the msy indicates outstanding coverage of the papaya genome by this bac library, considering that the centromere of the y chromosome is likely within the msy  <cit> .

genetic recombination
dapi  stained papaya chromosomes revealed highly condensed heterochromatin knobs located in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions of all nine pairs of chromosomes  <cit> . lengths of the condensed heterochromatin knobs varied among the chromosomes  <cit> . we examined the genome-wide recombination of papaya based on our integrated map. consistent with papaya chromosome structure, recombination suppression regions were found at or near the center of all the major linkage groups, suggesting that those regions might be centromeric. it has been demonstrated that the rate of recombination varies among chromosomes, across individual chromosomes, and between different sex types  <cit> . severe recombination suppression was found in the centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin of several species  <cit> . a 53-fold reduction in recombination frequency was found in the left pericentromere of the arabidopsis centromere  <dig> , a 10-fold reduction in the right pericentromere, and 200-fold reduction in the centromeric core  <cit> . a large quantity of repeats, duplications, and insertions were accumulated in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions, while very few genes were found in these regions  <cit> .

the msy on lg <dig> is extensively suppressed for recombination. the estimated size of the suppressed region was about 8– <dig> mb based on the integrated genetic and physical map, consistent with the 8– <dig> mb physical map estimate of the male specific region of the y chromosome  <cit> . the physical location of the msy is in the middle of the y chromosome based on pachytene fish images  <cit> , but the genetic map of the msy was on the upper half of the msy, likely due to the lower recombination rate on one arm of the y chromosome  <cit> . indeed, pachytene fish images showed the denser heterochromatic regions on one of the chromosome arms  <cit> . fewer markers mapped on this chromosome arm resulting in fewer anchored wgs sequences; it is possible that fewer wgs sequence could be assembled due to the repetitive nature of the heterochromatic regions on this arm. the location of the msy in figure  <dig> is likely distorted for this reason and the physical size of lg <dig> is underestimated. interestingly, suppression of recombination spread to adjacent regions of the msy, but recombination rates recovered gradually first and then increased dramatically at about  <dig> mb from the msy resulting in a hotspot of  <dig> cm per mb. this is equivalent to  <dig> kb per cm, a 7-fold increase compared to the genome wide average of  <dig> kb per cm. beyond these two hotspots, the recombination rate declined in the remaining region of both arms with an average about  <dig>  cm per mb at  <dig> kb per cm or  <dig> -fold increase than the genome wide average. our results demonstrated the dynamics of recombination in a pair of evolving young sex chromosomes that have changed since the initiation of the msy, and are different from the sudden increase recombination in the small  <dig>  mb and  <dig> kb pseudo-autosomal regions of the ancient human y chromosome  <cit> .

it is well known that recombination rate varies along chromosomes. recombination rates are higher in telomeric regions when compared to centromeric and chromosomal regions. in the human genome, the mean intensity per hotspot is  <dig>  cm in telomeric regions, while the mean intensity is  <dig>  cm in centromeric regions  <cit> . consistently, most recombination suppression regions of papaya were found in the middle of chromosomes and several recombination hotspots were found on one end of lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  it has been reported that recombination rates were higher in regions with higher gene density  <cit> . recombination hotspots would be the regions favored by natural selection to produce beneficial allele combinations. to determine whether the recombination hotspots found in papaya are located in gene-riched regions, we would need fine-scale mapping of recombination rates across the genome.

potential applications
a genetic linkage map is constructed by placing genetic loci on chromosomes based on recombination frequencies, while the physical map is constructed based on overlapping restriction patterns of large insert bac clones. integration of the genetic and physical maps revealed recombination hotspots as well as regions suppressed for recombination. the integrated genetic and physical map allows estimates of physical distances between genetic markers, and provided the framework for assembling the whole genome shotgun sequences. meanwhile, assembled genome sequence provided precise physical distances between genes and dna markers in gapless regions. these three genomic resources complement one another and correct errors from each individual source. the combined information enhances the capacity for map-based cloning and identification of underlying genes controlling quantitative traits in papaya.

the draft genome sequence contained 92% of the genes in papaya  <cit> . to uncover the genes controlling complex traits, we will need to rely on mapping quantitative trait loci  and map-based cloning. the integrated map reported here will simplify the process of map-based cloning. a total of  <dig> ssr markers were integrated with the physical map. using a subset of these mapped ssr markers to screen segregating populations will allow qtls to be mapped on intervals of the genetic map, and fine mapping can be carried out using markers from bac end sequences or wgs sequences within an interval. most qtls controlling economically important traits in papaya have not yet been characterized, including those for controlling sugar content, fruit size, shape, and weight, and some complex disease reactions. we expect that our integrated map and genome sequence will expedite the mapping and cloning of target genes and facilitate papaya breeding through marker-assisted selection.

the current draft sequence of the papaya genome represents about 75% of the papaya genome  <cit> . with rapid progress in next generation sequencing technology, additional papaya whole genome sequencing may be carried out in the foreseeable future. the papaya bac-based physical map integrated with the genome sequences and genetic map will be an essential resource for closing gaps of any particular genomic region under investigation. in addition, this integrated resource can help identify heterochromatic regions that are difficult to sequence using the current wgs approach, so that a different strategy might be carried out to fill these gaps when effective methods become available. moreover, the integrated genetic and physical map could also provide a framework to guide the genome sequencing of related species.

a total of  <dig>  overgos representing conserved sequences of arabidopsis and genetically mapped brassica loci were anchored on the integrated genetic and physical map and the draft genome sequence of papaya. these overgos are direct links among papaya, arabidopsis and brassica genomes for comparative genomic research among species within the order brassicales. the overgos were designed from single-copy genes and sequences of arabidopsis and brassica. these anchored overgos further improved the quality of the physical map construction. along with the fpc contigs and wgs sequences, overgo markers could help identify synteny and rearrangements in target regions of these genomes, particularly in these recently duplicated genomes of arabidopsis and brassica  <cit> .

carica papaya is the only species of the genus carica. the small gene pool has limited papaya improvement through traditional breeding. for example, the papaya ringspot virus  severely damaged papaya production worldwide. however, development of prsv-resistant papaya using traditional breeding approaches was not successful due to the lack of prsv-resistant genes in papaya. vasconcellea, a closely related sister genus of papaya, contains genes resistant to several major virus and fungus diseases, including prsv. the integrated genetic and physical map can serve as a reference to study gene and genome evolution, to reveal the genetic base of unique ecological adaptations of carica and vasconcellea, and to clone the disease resistance genes from vasconcellea species for papaya improvement.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a bac-based physical map of carica papaya using high information-content fingerprinting and overgo hybridization of conserved dna probes from arabidopsis and brassica. this physical map was integrated with a sequence tagged high-density genetic map and a draft genome sequence. the integrated map revealed recombination cold and hot spots in the papaya genome, often associated with known chromosomal features such as the sex chromosomes, centromeres, and telomeres. the recombination rates of the pericentromeric regions are reduced but not completely suppressed. the complete suppression of the 8– <dig> mb msy and the rise and fall of recombination rates in flanking regions indicated the recombination rates in this specialized region evolved over the course of sex chromosome evolution, particularly in these early stages. the integrated map with the draft genome sequence and anchored overgo probes from arabidopsis and brassica is a valuable resource for the plant research community.
