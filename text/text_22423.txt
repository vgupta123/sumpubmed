BACKGROUND
restriction endonuclease-like proteins, also called a pd-xk nucleases, constitute a large and diverse superfamily of enzymes that are involved in numerous nucleic acid cleavage events important for various cellular processes. the scop  <cit>  database currently groups  <dig> families of known structure in the restriction endonuclease-like superfamily, including among others  <dig> different restriction endonucleases  <cit> , holiday junction resolvases   <cit> , lambda exonuclease  <cit>  and very short patch repair  endonuclease  <cit> . their function varies from repairing damaged dna , resolving holliday junctions , performing additional cleavage events in dna recombination , to protection of host organisms against foreign dna invasion .

despite displaying very little sequence similarity, the restriction endonuclease-like enzymes retain a common core fold that consists of a central four-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by an α-helix on either side . the general architecture of the restriction endonuclease-like fold allows recognition of diverse nucleic acid substrates, which may vary from specific palindromic dna sequences  to unique dna backbone structures . the substrate specificity in many cases arises from various insertions to the core fold that may even encompass entire domains  <cit> .

the restriction endonuclease-like superfamily possesses a relatively conserved active site pd-xk signature , critical for cleaving the nucleic acid phosphodiester bond  <cit> . the signature lysine residue is responsible for positioning water for in-line attack on the substrate phosphodiester bond, while the carboxylates coordinate up to three metal ions that serve as cofactors in the reaction. several variations to this named motif exist, and additional family conserved charged or polar residues located in core helices of the fold  contribute to active site architecture in many cases  <cit> .

standard homology detection methods usually fail to recognize novel pd-xk nucleases due to lack of significant sequence similarity between families and numerous insertions to the core fold. in previous work we applied a transitive search approach using the meta profile comparison method meta-basic and identified nine new restriction endonuclease-like fold families among hypothetical proteins  <cit> . some of these families were also detected by others using hhsearch method  <cit> . in this study we employed a modified transitive search procedure by including additional below threshold score meta-basic hits in updated pfam and pdb databases and identified five more novel pd-xk nuclease families.

RESULTS
this study is a continuation of our previous work identifying novel restriction endonuclease-like fold families among catalogued pfam families  using transitive searches with the meta-basic method. although existing restriction endonuclease-like structures retain similar active site residues within the same core fold  , they exhibit extreme structural diversity . since meta-basic scores are benchmarked using rigorous structural criteria to define confidence thresholds , the structural diversity of pd-xk nuclease fold can be reflected as lower than threshold meta-basic scores. accordingly, we modified our previous transitive search approach to consider potentially correct meta-basic predictions placed  among unreliable or incorrect ones. while this method extension provides an effective strategy for detecting extremely distant homologs, the resulting non-trivial predictions require additional criteria for justification. therefore, we demand that family profiles of low-scoring hits retain all core secondary structure elements comprising the nuclease fold and conserve critical functional residues essential for function. confirmation of these predictions by a consensus of fold recognition methods, such as those produced by 3d-jury must also support the non-trivial links. consequently, an extensive search of the updated grdb database, which stores meta-basic connections between pfam families and pdb structures, led to identification of five new putative pd-xk nuclease families  encompassing hundreds of so far uncharacterized proteins of unknown function. three of these families represent extremely distant homologs , while two are newly defined in the updated grdb system . in addition to conserving critical features of the restriction endonuclease-like fold, all families display similar hydrophobicity patterns to known pd-xk nucleases . all predictions are discussed in details below.

duf506
duf <dig> family  embraces a number of plant proteins including  <dig> copies from oryza sativa,  <dig> copies from arabidopsis thaliana and single sequences from pinus pinaster and medicago truncatula. meta-basic mapped the consensus sequence of duf <dig> onto holliday junction resolvase  structure  and pfam family upf <dig> , which has been predicted as distantly related to hjc. according to our benchmarks, predictions with z-score > <dig> have <10% probability of being incorrect. in addition, several fold recognition servers also selected restriction endonuclease-like fold among first  <dig> models. duf <dig> proteins possess a predicted conserved core ααααβββαβαα secondary structure pattern . duf <dig> family members retain the characteristic motif ii  of the pd-xk signature, with the exception of three conservative replacements of aspartate for glutamate in gi: <dig>  gi: <dig> and gi: <dig>  motif iii is represented by a x pattern . the missing positively charged residue in motif iii is possibly replaced by a conserved arginine in motif iv  located in the proceeding α-helix . a similar migration of this critical active site residue can be observed for the duf <dig> family  <cit> . although one of the family members, pinus pinaster protein , has been reported to be expressed in native cells  <cit> , this prediction represents the only functional information available for this family of sequences. duf <dig> proteins lack any identified fused domains that might hint at biological function, and detailed analysis of a genomic context did not help identify potential physiological roles for the family.

duf524
the duf <dig> family  includes a number of hypothetical proteins of bacterial origin  and two sequences from archeal species . the c-terminal region of duf <dig> consensus sequence was mapped by meta-basic onto the pd-xk nuclease families duf <dig>   <cit>  and type i restriction enzyme r protein n terminus   <cit> . additional support for this prediction was obtained with 3d-jury although with below threshold scores due to inconsistent alignments generated by servers.

duf <dig> family proteins consist of at least two domains: a c-terminal pd-xk nuclease domain and an n-terminal region of yet unknown function with a predicted all β secondary structure pattern followed by mainly α-helical structure. the duf <dig> restriction endonuclease-like domain has two additional β-strands inserted to the core fold after the first core α-helix . similar insertion in this region can be found in bsobi restriction endonuclease   <cit> . the pd-xk signature is clearly conserved among duf <dig> family members and corresponds to invariant pd  and dak  motifs . additionally, duf <dig> proteins conserve a glutamic acid in motif i , most likely involved in metal ion binding. lastly, the second core α-helix contains an invariant mhxyrd motif .

the cog corresponding to duf <dig>  has a confidently detected  genomic neighbourhood association to a unique family of restriction endonuclease gtpase subunits . these gtpases have been assigned to aaa+ class chaperonin-like atpases  <cit>  and include mcrb of the e. coli methylation-dependent restriction system . in this system, dna cleavage by the mcrc subunit is strictly coupled to gtp hydrolysis by the mcrb subunit  <cit>  instead of the typical atp cofactor requirement of most restriction modification systems xk endonuclease  <cit> , which supports assignment of duf <dig> to the restriction endonuclease-like superfamily and suggests a function of methylation-dependent restriction for this group of unknown proteins.

duf1626
duf <dig> family  includes  <dig> proteins from certain archeal  and bacterial  organisms. the consensus sequence of this family was mapped with an above threshold scores to both pd-xk pfam families: duf <dig>   <cit> , restriction endonuclease  and pdb structures: holliday junction resolvases hje  and hjc .

majority of duf <dig> proteins possess an additional n-terminal α-helical region, mainly coiled-coil  and are frequently annotated as tropomyosin, coiled-coil or microtubule binding proteins. specifically, rps-blast searches of the conserved domain database   <cit>  detect sequence similarity to several coiled-coil containing families, although the repeated sequence patterns found in coiled-coils render this similarity unreliable for any type of functional or evolutionary assumptions.

the duf <dig> restriction endonuclease-like domain has predicted αβββαβαβ topology , where the c-terminal elements possibly extend the domain core. motif iii lysine of the pd-xk nuclease fingerprint is often substituted by threonine  and it is likely that, similarly to duf <dig> or duf <dig>  <cit> , the lysine migrated to an α-helix  following the third core β-strand . specifically, duf <dig> proteins with threonine in motif iii possess a conserved patch of positively charged lysine and arginine residues in the motif iv α-helix that might be involved in substrate binding or contribute to active site formation.

duf1703
the duf <dig> family  groups together a set of uncharacterized proteins from one archeal  and various bacterial organisms. the c-terminal region of duf <dig> consensus sequence has detectable similarity to pd-xk nucleases . specifically, the duf <dig> c-terminal domain has the predicted secondary structure pattern of the restriction endonuclease-like fold core with an additional β-strand at c-terminus  and conserves all restriction endonuclease-like superfamily motifs . these include both pd-xk signature motifs ii and iii as well as two other family conserve positions: a charged aspartate residue in the first core α-helix , presumably responsible for metal ion binding, and a glutamine residue in the second core α-helix , that may take part in binding of nucleic acid substrate.

meta-basic linked the duf <dig> n-terminal region to an archeal atpase family . the initial assignment was further supported with 3d-jury that mapped this region with above threshold scores  to several structures from the scop extended aaa-atpases  family of p-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases fold . the duf <dig> aaa+ module consists of two domains: an n-terminal α/β domain   <cit>  with characteristic walker a and walker b motifs, and a small anti-parallel four-helix bundle domain . in typical aaa+ structures, residues from the walker a motif ) and the walker b motif  together bind nucleoside and mg2+ in the deep cleft between two domains. while duf <dig> family proteins possess classical walker b motif , residues in the walker a motif differ from the canonical definition: arginines replace the first and second glycines i.e. 44rprrfgks <dig> in gi: <dig>  . detailed analysis of aaa+ family sequences and structures revealed that similar changes to walker a motif are possible , but they usually correlate with mutations in other positions in order to maintain active site pocket function, shape and accessibility. other defined aaa+ family elements, such as the sensor  <dig> and sensor  <dig> regions  <cit>  that help catalyze hydrolysis lack corresponding functional residues in duf <dig> sequences  have diverged in this family. specifically, the sensor  <dig> region , situated in a helical turn after strand  <dig> , conserves a glycine residue  instead of a polar amino acid, while the sensor  <dig> region , located at the n-termini of helix  <dig>  lacks the typical arginine finger. we hypothesize that second and third conserved arginines in the duf <dig> family walker a motif  substitute for the sensor i polar residue and the sensor ii arginine, respectively .

in summary, duf <dig> family proteins share a common four-domain structure, with an n-terminal aaa+ module , a c-terminal restriction endonuclease-like domain and a small α-helical region  in-between. similar domain architecture can be found for other pd-xk nucleases , providing further support for functional predictions.

yhga-like
the yhga-like family  of putative transposases encompasses hundreds of bacterial proteins in addition to a few archeal  and one viral sequence from sodalis phage. these proteins are assigned to the pd-xk nuclease superfamily based on a detected meta-basic connection to herpes virus protein ul <dig> , which has been recently identified as an additional member of this superfamily  <cit> .

the predicted pd-xk nuclease domain resides in the n-terminal region of yhga-like proteins and displays a common predicted secondary structure αααβαββαβ pattern , with two α-helical insertions to the core fold. similar insertions of two α-helices before and a single α-helix after the first core β-strand can be found in recb structure   <cit> . in the yhga-like family, the predicted restriction endonuclease-like domain is followed by a c-terminal α-helical region .

the yhga-like family members clearly conserve active site motifs ii and iii , where motif iii is identical to that of the coi-a-like family . additional charged residues include an invariant motif i putative metal ion binding glutamate   <cit>  and a motif iv arginine . importantly, a few bacterial sequences have glutamine substituted by lysine in motif iii, nevertheless, glutamine is found in motif iv instead of conserved arginine. this evident sequence correlation in critical active site positions further stresses the correctness of the prediction for the yhga-like family.

using cog <dig>  as an input, the string database assigns a high confidence combined neighborhood and domain fusion score  to a group of uncharacterized cyanobacterial proteins  that correspond to duf <dig>  duf <dig> was previously identified as a pd-xk nuclease   <cit> , suggesting that the two families arose from a genetic duplication and may perform similar functions.

CONCLUSIONS
the pfam database currently defines a pd-xk nuclease superfamily clan that groups  <dig> different families: including restriction endonuclease, archaeal holliday junction resolvase , rmuc, herpes virus protein ul <dig>  competence protein coia-like, sugar fermentation stimulation protein, vrr-nuc, herpesvirus alkaline exonuclease, duf <dig>  duf <dig>  duf <dig>  duf <dig>  duf <dig>  duf <dig> and upf <dig>  many of these families were identified in our previous studies  <cit> . in this work we performed systematic searches in updated pfam database with transitive meta-basic approach to further expand the realm of pd-xk nuclease superfamily. we analyzed below threshold meta-basic predictions to identify correct hits that due to their large evolutionary distance were assigned below cut-off confidence scores. selection of these highly non trivial but reliable assignments was based on consistency of a predicted secondary structure pattern with that of the restriction endonuclease-like fold core, general conservation of hydrophobicity patterns, and presence of the signature pd-xk nuclease motifs critical for function. this strategy resulted in identification of five new pd-xk nuclease families in the pfam database  encompassing hundreds of uncharacterized or hypothetical proteins. additionally, analysis of genomic context for examined families strengthened several of our predictions. altogether, obtained results suggest that combination of transitive meta-basic searches with various other analyses  of below threshold hits may push limits further for distant homology detection in the 'midnight zone' of homology. finally, using top-of-the line fold recognition methods we also identified aaa+ domain in the n-terminal region of duf <dig> proteins that is not detectable by standard sequence comparison methods.
