BACKGROUND
head foam stability and haze absents  are the main characteristics associated with fresh and pleasant beer  <cit> . proteins in beer have an effect on both haze formation and foam stability, as polypeptides of storage proteins from barley aggregate and form haze during maturation of beer while other proteins form complexes with hop acids that stabilize the beer foam  <cit> . in recent years, focus on proteomic analysis of beer has become a way to unravel how beer proteins evolve during the production process of beer and how proteins in beer interact. the most comprehensive proteome studies report that beer proteomes consist of only 20– <dig> different proteins from barley  <cit> , all heat stable and protease resistant  <cit> . however, it is not only proteins from barley that are identified in the beer proteome; also proteins from yeast and maize have been identified  <cit> . the two most predominant, barley-derived proteins in beer are lipid transfer protein  <dig>  and protein z, estimated to contribute for more than 25% of the total amount of proteins in beer  <cit> . different inhibitors involved in the pathogenic defence of barley are found in the final beer, such as α-amylase inhibitor , trypsin/α-amylase inhibitor  and trypsin inhibitors   <cit> . perrocheau et al.  showed that hordeins, i.e. storage proteins from barley, and many of the trypsin/α-amylase inhibitors from barley, vanish during the process of making beer  and only half of the proteins identified in barley grain were also present in beer. other studies used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  to discover proteins involved in head foam and beer haze formation  <cit>  and the influence of malt modification and processing  <cit> . proteins derived from brewer’s yeast have also been identified in beer, although the range of identified proteins vary from 2– <dig> proteins  <cit>  to  <dig> proteins  <cit>  and  <dig> protein fragments  <cit> . the origin of the identified proteins also vary from proteins localized in the cytosol, such as enolase and triosephosphate isomerase, to proteins like swc <dig> and uth <dig> that are associated to the cell wall  <cit> . one common feature for all beer proteome studies, so far, is that commercial beers have been used where no information on raw materials, choice of brewer’s yeast strain, or fermentation conditions have been given.

in this study, we used two ale brewer’s yeast strains, differing in their ability to consume fermentable sugars, for brewing beer under controlled conditions to determine the protein changes caused by fermentation, and to explore if there are any yeast strain dependent changes of the beer proteome.

methods
yeast strains and media
the yeast strains  used in this study were ale brewer’s yeast strains, belonging to the species saccharomyces cerevisiae, obtained from white labs  and our own collection  at the department of food science, food microbiology, university of copenhagen, respectively. yeast strains were grown in  <dig> % malt extract,  <dig> % yeast extract,  <dig> % peptone, 1% glucose, ph <dig>   or in standard hopped wort  from skands brewery .

beer fermentation
aerobic propagation of yeast was started from a single colony on a mygp-agar plate in 10 ml mygp, in duplicate. after incubation at 20°c for 24 h, the yeast suspensions were transferred to 100 ml mygp in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks with aeration at 200 rpm. yeast suspensions were transferred after two days at 20°c to 400 ml double concentrated mygp and incubated for 24 h at 20°c. yeast cells were harvested  and inoculated at 7 ×  <dig> cells/ml in  <dig> litres of wort saturated with air. fermentations were carried out in biological duplicates in  <dig> -liters european brewing convention  tubes at 18°c for 155 hours. to monitor the fermentation, samples of culture broth were collected aseptically twice on a daily basis from the top of the ebc-tubes for 155 hours. yeast growth was followed by measuring the optical density at 600 nm  and ph .

sugar and ethanol determination
samples were filtrated using a  <dig>  μm sterile filter and kept at -20°c until analysis. sugar and ethanol concentrations were determined using a hplc  with a microguard cation h cartridge followed by an aminex hpx-87h column  connected to a ri detector . the column was eluted with a degassed mobile phase containing  <dig>  mm h2so <dig>  ph  <dig> , at 50°c and at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/min.

beer protein sample preparation
samples of beer proteins were collected aseptically from the top of the fermentation vessel at the end of fermentation . the culture broth samples were filter sterilized using a  <dig>  μm filter to remove yeast cells and degas the sample. salts and free amino acids were removed on a sephadex g <dig> desalting column  using 20% mcllvaine buffer  ph  <dig>  added 5% ethanol in all steps. after desalting, proteins were concentrated by lyophilisation and dissolved in 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea and 3% 3--1-propanesulfonate . protein concentrations were determined using the 2d quant kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with bovine serum albumin as a standard.

two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 
2-de was run according to jacobsen et al.   <cit>  with minor modifications. prior to 2-de, rehydration buffer , 1%v/v destreak reagent ) was added to samples of beer proteins  to a final volume of 350 μl. samples were centrifuged  and applied to an ipg strip . isoelectric focusing  was run on an ettan ipgphor  for a total of  <dig>  vh as described in  <cit> . after ief, ipg strips were reduced for 20 min by 10 mg/ml dtt in equilibration buffer  and  <dig> %  bromophenol blue) followed by alkylation for 20 min with 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide in equilibration buffer  <cit> . electrophoresis in the second dimension was carried out using  <dig> % acrylamide gels  and was run on an ettantm dalt six electrophoresis unit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. proteins were stained by blue silver stain over night and de-stained in water until background was negligible  <cit> . each biological replicate was done in technical triplicates to ensure reproducibility.

in-gel trypsinolysis and maldi-tof-ms
protein spots were manually excised from the blue silver stained 2d-gels and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion according to  <cit> , omitting the reduction and alkylation steps as this was done prior to 2-de. briefly, protein spots were de-stained in 40% ethanol, dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile, rehydrated in 10 mm nh4hco <dig> with  <dig>  ng ng/μl trypsin , incubated on ice for 45 min, and finally diluted five fold with 10 mm nh4hco <dig> and incubated at 37°c over night. supernatant was removed from the gel and stored at -20°c until analysis.

samples were added on an anchorchip™  as described by  <cit> . mass determinations were determined by an ultraflex ii maldi-tof mass spectrometer  in positive reflector mode for peptide mass mapping or peptide fragment ion mapping. spectra were externally calibrated using a tryptic digest of β-lactoglobulin. the obtained spectra were analysed using flex-analysis  <dig> . <dig> and biotools  <dig>  software program before searching an in-house mascot server  against the genomes of saccharomyces cerevisiae and hordeum vulgare. the following parameters were used for protein identification: allowed global modification; carbamidomethyl cysteine; variable modification; oxidation of methionine; missed cleavages - 1; peptide tolerance – 80 ppm and ms/ms tolerance ±  <dig>  da. trypsin autolysis products were used for internal mass calibration. proteins were positively identified, when a significant mascot score and at least three matched peptides in ms analysis, or one matched peptide in ms/ms analysis , occurred.

statistical analysis
beer properties are represented as the mean values ± standard error of the mean  from two biological replicates with at least duplicate measurements. statistical analysis was performed by a two tailed t-test using statplus software . probabilities less than  <dig>  were considered significant.

RESULTS
beer fermentation
to investigate the influences of fermentation and brewer’s yeast on the beer proteome, we used two different ale brewing yeast strains  to produce beer. the yeast strains were chosen based on their different attenuation degrees; i.e. their different abilities to deplete fermentable sugars. the strain kvl <dig>  which is an industrial ale brewer’s yeast strain, is reported to have an attenuation degree of 85%, while the wlp <dig>  which is a micro brewer’s yeast strain, is reported to attenuate 73–80% .

the two beers were brewed using standard hopped wort  in ebc tubes. as expected, some fermentable sugars were still present in the beer brewed with wlp <dig>  while all fermentable sugars were depleted by the kvl <dig> yeast strain . in both beers, the yeast cells were growing for 60 hours, reaching od <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for wlp <dig> and kvl <dig>  respectively, before onset of flocculation . the flocculation ability of wlp <dig> was higher than for kvl <dig>  as ten fold less yeast cells were in suspension for the beer brewed with yeast strain wlp <dig> after 130 hours compared to the beer brewed with kvl <dig> .

for both yeast strains, the ph dropped from  <dig>  to  <dig>   and the ethanol concentration increased from  <dig> to  <dig> - <dig> %   after 60 hours of fermentation. furthermore, a decrease in the protein concentration was observed during fermentation. in the beginning of the fermentation, the wort contained  <dig>  mg/ml, while in the final beer the protein concentration was  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml for beers brewed with yeast strain wlp <dig> and kvl <dig>  respectively .

the ethanol and protein concentrations between the two beers were not significantly different .

protein identification
proteins from the unfermented wort and the two beers were separated by 2-de to estimate differences in protein composition, caused by different yeast strains during the fermentation process with the unfermented wort as a reference . all distinct protein spots from each proteome were analysed by maldi-tof-ms or ms/ms. from the  <dig> distinct protein spots picked, we identified  <dig> spots that originated from  <dig> unique proteins. the most dominant proteins found in wort and beer were identified as protein z, ltp <dig> and the barley-derived inhibitors pup <dig>  cme, cma and bdai-i . ltp <dig> was identified in four discrete protein spots with a pi ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in wort , as compared to five locations in the wlp <dig> and kvl <dig> beers . a fragment of the barley storage protein d-hordein was only detected in wort .

aprotein identifications were confirmed with a significant mascot score of  <dig> for peptide mass fingerprint and anova p ≤  <dig> , and a minimum of three matched peptides.

bsignificant ms/ms score is >  <dig> for searches in saccharomyces cerevisiae. spectra’s for single peptide identifications are supplied in additional file  <dig> 

a general feature for all proteomes was that the proteins clustered in two regions on the gel, a region in the range of 36–42 kda and one low molecular region from 8–20 kda. furthermore, a massively stained protein cluster at about pi  <dig> - <dig>  with a mr of 37–42 kda was identified in all gels. this protein cluster corresponded to the most abundant protein in beer - protein z . during fermentation of both beers, wort protein changes occurred. the protein spots identified as ltp <dig>  on the wort 2-de gel were more intense, than the corresponding spots on the 2-de gel for the two beers. in the same pi range as ltp <dig> was detected, two lower molecular protein spots  were detected in wort and identified as ltp <dig>  these two ltp <dig> spots were undetectable in beer . another feature that occurred during fermentation was that the serpin protein cluster of protein z was shifted towards the acidic area, dividing the serpin protein cluster into two . this was not observed on the wort protein 2-de gel .

three protein spots found exclusively in beer were identified to be cell wall associated yeast proteins, uth <dig> – involved in cell wall biogenesis , exg <dig> – an exo-β- <dig> -glucanase,  and bgl <dig> - endo-β- <dig> -glucanase . in both beers, two higher molecular protein spots with a pi of  <dig>  were observed and identified by maldi-tof-ms as uth <dig>  and exg <dig> . although protein spots corresponding to uth <dig> were observed in both beers, uth <dig> was only identified in beer brewed with wlp <dig> . in beer brewed with kvl <dig> a protein spot of 34 kda  was identified as bgl <dig>  which was not observed in the proteome of beer brewed with wlp <dig>  however, exg <dig> was identified in the beer brewed with both brewer’s yeast strains .

discussion
several proteome analyses of beer  <cit> , malt  <cit>  and beer related processes  <cit>  have been made, but none seem to have considered the influence of fermentation and brewer’s yeast strains on the beer proteome. to investigate if proteome changes from wort to beer were yeast strain dependent, proteins from wort and beer brewed with two different ale brewer’s yeast strains were separated by 2-de and identified by maldi-tof-ms. it should be noted that the beers in this study are immature, that is beers that have not matured after fermentation. in the following, however, they will be referred to as beer.

the protein content of the beers were  <dig>  mg/ml for kvl <dig> and  <dig>  mg/ml for wlp <dig>  placing them in the lower end of the range for a normal beer  <cit> . the concentration of wort proteins  is higher than for the brewed beers, indicating that proteins are either degraded proteolytically by the yeast during fermentation and/or precipitate with the yeast slurry.

the most recent proteome studies have identified 20– <dig> barley proteins in wort and beer  <cit> . in our study, nine unique proteins are identified out of  <dig> distinct protein spots analysed . many of the proteins have multiple spots, probably due to different protein modifications taking place during germination of barley grain, killing or wort boiling  <cit> . for example, protein z appears as a dominant diffuse zone in a 2-de gel probably due to glycosylation of lysine residues by maillard reactions occurring under the roasting of malt  <cit> . all identified barley proteins are reported as protease resistant and heat stable, as most of them are protease inhibitors and have survived a more than one hour long hop boiling   <cit> .

in the wort proteome, protein z appears as a cluster of many spots, while in both beer proteomes this cluster is divided into two clusters . division of the protein z cluster into two in both beers indicates that yeast has an influence on the modifications of protein z. this, however, remains to be further investigated.

ltp <dig> is present in two spots in the wort proteome  but absent in the two beer proteomes, although a faint spot is observed in beer brewed with kvl <dig> but not identified . many studies have shown that denatured and unfolded ltp <dig> in beer is degraded by yeast-derived proteinase a  <cit> , which can explain why ltp <dig> disappears and a decrease in ltp <dig> intensity is observed in our study. degradation of ltp <dig> is not a desired trait in beer production, as ltp <dig> is a key foam protein and in addition acts as an antioxidant in beer  <cit> .

the three high molecular weight proteins, uth <dig>  exg <dig> and bgl <dig>  found exclusively in beer after fermentation, are identified to be yeast proteins. uth <dig> is involved in the cell wall biogenesis, oxidative stress response, and the protein resembles β-glucanases but no activity is reported  <cit> . exg <dig> and bgl <dig> are involved in the modification of the glucan network of the yeast cell wall  <cit> . it is reported that exg <dig>  bgl <dig> and uth <dig> are anchored to the yeast cell wall by di-sulphide bridges, as they are released from yeast cells upon treatment with reducing agents as dtt  <cit> . during wine fermentations, yeast cells release exg <dig> and bgl <dig> from the cell wall to the wine  <cit> . in beer, fasilo et al.  identified exg <dig>  bgl <dig> and uth <dig> among the  <dig> protein fragments, originating from s. cerevisiae <cit> , and very recently the presence of these three full-length proteins have also been identified in different commercial beers  <cit> . these data correspond well with our findings here.

in addition, we report for the first time that different brewer’s yeast strains render different beer proteomes; i.e. exg <dig> and bgl <dig> are identified in the kvl <dig> beers, whereas in the wlp <dig> beer only exg <dig> is identified. these data strongly indicate that changes in the beer proteome are strain dependent.

identification of released yeast di-sulphide anchored proteins uth <dig>  exg <dig> and bgl <dig> in beer indicates the existence of a reducing environment which can be beneficial for the beer quality by reducing and liberating cell wall anchored yeast proteins. overexpression of β-glucanases, like exg <dig> and blg <dig>  in genetically modified brewer’s yeast strains, have shown positive effects on filtration of beer, due to increased degradation of β-glucans interfering with filtration  <cit> . also in wine fermentations, an elevated production of exg <dig> has positive effects on the quality of the end product due to an increased production of volatile products  <cit> . uth <dig> could be speculated to function as an antioxidant or chelator of transition metals in beer due to its conserved cysteine residue motive with a putative fe-binding motive  <cit> . a controlled release of these cell wall anchored proteins could contribute to improved beer quality.

it should be stressed that our study, using immature beer, only reveals a very limited number of yeast proteins in the beer as compared to the reports of e.g. fasoli et al.  and konecna et al. . these authors investigate commercial beers that are most likely fully mature and pasteurized  <cit> , although not specifically stated, thereby explaining the higher number of identified yeast proteins due to cell lysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we find that the proteome of immature beer is dependent on the brewer’s yeast strain used. these data suggest a potential of using different yeast strains to gain wanted protein-related traits of beer, such as e.g. filtration ability and oxidative stability.
