BACKGROUND
micrornas are small single-stranded endogenous rnas, approximately  <dig> nucleotides in length, which are involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation in a wide variety of species  <cit> . mirnas function as a component of an rna-induced silencing complex  by guiding it to specific targets through base-pairing interaction between the mirna seed region and a complementary sequence in the 3'-utr of a target transcript  <cit> . in humans and other animals, the seed region normally extends from the second to eighth positions of mature mirna  <cit> .

all known mirnas originate from a single-stranded rna precursor shaped as a hairpin loop structure  <cit> . in animals, the hairpin is excised from a longer precursor by drosha and subsequently cut by dicer, which produces an rna duplex with 3' overhanging ends, each  <dig> nucleotides long  <cit> . this duplex structure is shared between mirna and small interfering rna  processing pathways  <cit> . for both mirnas and sirnas, one of the duplex strands is then incorporated into the risc and the other eliminated. since the selected strand determines the functional specificity of an risc, this is a crucial step in the rna interference  pathway.

commonly, the two strands are incorporated into an risc with different probabilities  <cit> . in sirnas, strand selection probability depends on the relative thermodynamic stability of the ends of the precursor duplex: a strand with lower duplex stability at the 5'-end is preferentially selected  <cit> . a single mismatch within the first four nucleotides of an sirna duplex is sufficient to determine strand selection specificity. further, a single nucleotide substitution at the 5'-end of an sirna that changes thermodynamic asymmetry of a duplex is sufficient to completely reverse it  <cit> . in flies, the thermodynamic asymmetry of the sirna duplex is recognized by preferential binding of the dcr-2/r2d <dig> protein heterodimer to its more stable end, thus promoting asymmetric strand loading into the ago2-risc complex ,  <dig> worm ,  <dig> mouse, and  <dig> human mirnas has shown that their mirna precursors exhibit a thermodynamic stability bias similar to that of sirnas, i.e. the strand with the less stable 5'-end is preferentially represented  <cit> . based on this observation, it was proposed that mirnas and sirnas might share the same strand selection determinants  <cit> . recent analysis of human and mouse mirna expression profiles, however, has shown that the relative expression levels of the two strands vary widely among tissues  <cit> . notably, in some tissues tested, mirnas originating from a thermodynamically unfavourable strand are present at levels comparable to or greater than that of their thermodynamically favourable counterparts.

in this study, we determine sequence elements associated with preferential mirna strand selection and/or rejection by analyzing the sequence composition and relative expression levels of mirna pairs originating from two strands of the same precursor duplex in high-throughput sequencing data from humans and flies.

RESULTS
single precursor commonly generates two mature mirnas
to quantify human mirna expression levels, we isolated total small rnas  from the cerebral cortex of  <dig> healthy adult human males and sequenced the pooled sample using illumina high throughput sequencing technology. we then mapped the resulting  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads from a single sequencing lane to the human genome . of these sequences,  <dig> , <dig> map to  <dig> annotated human mirnas with a sequence copy number per mirna ranging from two to  <dig> , <dig> . as reported previously, the majority of mirnas  originate from precursors  containing two annotated mirnas  <cit>  . further, for  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> precursors with one annotated mirna, we find at least two sequence reads that correspond to their unannotated mirna counterparts . thus, by examining data from a single illumina sequencing lane, we can substantially reduce the number of mirna precursors that generate one expressed mature mirna. given that mature mirnas originate from a double-stranded precursor, it is likely that sufficient sequencing efforts will uncover the mirna counterparts of all known mirnas.

although each mirna precursor can potentially produce two mature mirnas, these mirnas are not expressed in a tissue at the same level. in fact, we find no correlation between expression levels of two mirnas originating from the same precursor in our data, indicating that relative strand abundance within mirna pairs differs widely among precursors  . this absence of any correlation within mirna pairs starkly contrasts with the strong positive correlation observed between mirna expression measurements in technical and biological replicates  . further, excluding  <dig> mirna precursors known to undergo posttranscriptional regulation  <cit>  or posttranscriptional editing  <cit>  did not affect the result .

to investigate the pattern of expression differences within mirna pairs further, we determined expression ratios between high- and low-expressed mirnas in all  <dig> pairs, including precursors with one of the two annotated mirnas not detected in our dataset, but annotated in the mirbase. we find a broad range of differences, with an expression ratio greater than  <dig> for  <dig> mirna pairs, and less than  <dig> for  <dig> mirna pairs . the mir-let-7f precursor shows the largest difference between high- and low-expressed mirnas:  <dig> , <dig> copies and three copies, respectively.

notably, in agreement with previous observations  <cit> , although the observed expression level differences agree somewhat with the existing annotation of mirna pairs as 5p/3p or mirna/mirna*, many deviations occur. in addition, considering high expression of some mirnas*  <cit> , the classification of all mirnas originating from the same precursor as 5p and 3p mirnas proposed in  <cit>  might be more forthcoming than the current one.

strand selection determinants of human mirnas
expression level differences between two mirnas originating from the same precursor cannot result from differential transcription efficiency; therefore, they must be caused by differential stability due to biased strand incorporation into the risc. to test whether particular sequence features may explain this bias, we compared the sequence composition of the  <dig> mirna pairs that exhibit an expression difference greater than 1000-fold between high- and low-expressed duplex strands to all  <dig> annotated human mirnas, as well as the  <dig> new mirnas identified in this study . we find three characteristic sequence features:  a u-bias at the 5'-end of the highly expressed strand ;  a c-bias at the 5'-end of the low expressed strand ;  an excess of purines  in the highly expressed strand and, consequently, an excess of pyrimidines  in the low expressed strand  .

in contrast, we find no specific sequence features characteristic of the mirna pairs originating from the  <dig> precursor duplexes with an expression difference between the strands less than 10-fold  . further, when the entire range of the expression differences within mirna pairs is considered, rather than only the two extreme groups, we find a gradual increase in the 5'-nucleotide preference and the purine/pyrimidine content bias as the expression difference within pairs increases . this result was not caused by low expression of the mirna pairs, as restricting the analysis to  <dig> mirna pairs with each mirna represented by more than  <dig> sequence reads did not affect the result.

to test reproducibility of this finding, we examined mirna sequences in a technical replicate of the pooled cerebral cortical sample, as well as in a cortical sample from a single adult human male . in both cases, we can identify the same sequence features characterising high- and low-expressed strands from precursors with a large strand selection bias, but not strands from precursors showing little bias . further, all three features can be reproduced in another four samples representing other tissues and species: in the human cell line   <cit> , human embryonic stem cells  <cit> , human embryoid bodies  <cit> , and mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit>  . thus, all sequence features we find associated with mirna strand selection in human brain are common among mammalian tissues.

although reproducible, the observed sequence features might potentially be explained by factors other than strand selection bias within mirna pairs. first, it is conceivable that illumina sequencing itself is biased towards rnas with a 5'-terminal u and a high purine content, and discriminates against rnas with a 5'-terminal c and a high pyrimidine content. after examining all  <dig>  unique sequences that can be mapped to the precursor region of known human mirnas, we find neither a purine/pyrimidine bias, nor a terminal u/c bias  .

second, the identified sequence features could reflect a common origin for the  <dig> examined mirna pairs within the mirna families. to assess this possibility, we retained only one randomly chosen mirna pair to represent a family. after doing so, we still observe all three sequence features among the remaining  <dig> mirna pairs .

third, the observed sequence features could be associated with the high expression level of mirnas, rather than with strand selection bias. indeed, one of the mirnas within a pair must be highly expressed to produce a greater than 1000-fold expression level difference. to assess this bias, we analyzed the sequence composition of  <dig> mirna pairs with an expression level higher than  <dig> copies for at least one of the two mirnas, and an expression difference within the pairs less than  <dig>  similarly, we sub-sampled  <dig> of the  <dig> mirna pairs with an expression difference greater than  <dig> -fold, while retaining a similar copy number distribution . we find that while all three sequence features are still clearly observable for the  <dig> mirna pairs with a large strand selection bias , none of the features are present among the  <dig> high-expressed mirna pairs with little strand selection bias . taken together, these results indicate that the identified sequence features are likely to be associated with strand selection bias within the human mirna pairs.

strand selection determinants of fly mirnas
to test whether the same sequence features determine expression differences within mirna pairs in another organism, we used published data containing  <dig> , <dig> roche/ <dig> sequence reads corresponding to  <dig>  unique sequences collected from fruit fly  s <dig> cells and from three tissues at  <dig> developmental stages  <cit> . after mapping these reads to the fly genome, we find sequences corresponding to  <dig> known fly mirnas with a copy number equal or greater than two . in addition, we identify  <dig> novel counterparts of known mirnas . thus, in flies as well as in humans, most mirna precursors produce two expressed mature mirna sequences.

we then determined whether specific sequence features determine strand selection bias in fly mirna pairs. since the fly sequence data has a smaller number of reads, we used expression differences greater than  <dig> as the strand selection bias cutoff for pairs, resulting in  <dig> mirna pairs -- comparable to the number used in the human data analysis. despite the smaller magnitude of expression differences within these mirna pairs, we find a significant preference for the 5'-terminal u in the high-expressed duplex strand when compared to all expressed mirnas . as in humans, the preference for a terminal uridine increases as the expression difference in mirna pairs increases . in contrast to humans, however, we find a preference for both c and g at the 5'-end of the low-expressed strand . further, we find no detectable bias in the purine/pyrimidine composition between the high- and the low-expressed strands within  <dig> mirna pairs  . analyzing an additional d. melanogaster dataset containing sequences from  <dig> small rna libraries and processed using illumina platform  <cit> , we obtain almost identical results . thus, sequence elements associated with preferential strand selection in humans and flies are not the same.

strand selection bias and mirna processing
can these additional sequence features found in humans facilitate asymmetric strand incorporation into an risc? the presence of specific nucleotides on the 5'-end of both selected and excluded mirnas is the first feature. in the plant arabidopsis thaliana, the 5'-terminal nucleotides determine the sorting of various small rnas into different argonaute protein complexes  <cit> . it is intriguing to speculate that despite the vast differences between rnai systems in humans and plants, human argonaute proteins may have retained the ability to discriminate 5'-terminal nucleotides, even though for a different purpose.

another feature is the preference for purine nucleotides in the high-expressed strand. we speculate that purine residues may facilitate strand loading into the risc through sequence-independent interactions. intriguingly, the paz domain of argonaute proteins, which is involved in the initial steps of rna recognition and binding, contains a large number of invariant aromatic residues involved in rna binding  <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that the stacking and hydrophobic interactions between these residues and the purine-rich strand of the mirna precursor duplex may contribute to strand selection.

finally, as strand selection specificity can result in enormous expression level differences within some mirna pairs, which in extreme cases can exceed one million copies, it is tempting to speculate that some of the sequence features we find may actively target the excluded mirna strand for degradation. it is important to mention, however, that sequence features identified here show significant associated with strand selection bias, but do not explain all strand selection preferences found among mirnas. notably, recent observation that strand selection preferences may vary among tissues implies that strand selection factors other that sequence features might exist  <cit> .

strand selection bias and mirna-based regulation
next we asked why strand selection bias exists for some mirna pairs and, conversely, why some mirna pairs are not biased. in our dataset,  <dig> of the  <dig> highest expressed mirnas have a greater than 1000-fold expression difference between high- and low-expressed mirna, while  <dig> showed a greater than 100-fold difference. similarly, among the  <dig> most highly expressed mirnas,  <dig> and  <dig> have a greater than 1000-fold and 100-fold expression difference, respectively. thus, a large proportion of highly expressed mirna precursors tends to generate only one highly expressed mature mirna. this is intuitively understandable, since in the absence of strand selection bias each precursor would generate a pair of highly expressed mature mirnas, collectively affecting the expression of the two groups of target genes. this condition must impose a strong constraint on the expression of an mirna pair, as two different groups of target genes would have to be regulated in a coordinated fashion among various tissues and developmental stages.

if strand selection bias serves to limit the influence of a second mature mirna on gene regulation, we expect to find fewer target genes for the low-expressed mirna strand as compared to high-expressed one. using the targetscans algorithm to identify evolutionarily conserved target sites  <cit> , we indeed find that the high-expressed mirnas have significantly more potential target genes than their low-expressed counterparts . this result confirms the notion that strand selection bias limits the regulatory role of a second mature mirna that can be generated from a highly expressed precursor. it also indicates that the strand selection bias observed in the examined dataset is likely to persist throughout various tissues and various evolutionary lineages of vertebrates.

in contrast to the  <dig> mirna pairs exhibiting a large strand selection bias, we find no significant difference in the target gene numbers between the high- and low-expressed mirnas originating from the  <dig> pairs showing little bias . further, the numbers of target genes for these mirnas were significantly lower on average than the corresponding numbers for the high-expressed mirnas from the  <dig> biased pairs . thus, expression of a single mirna per precursor may be more compatible with the regulation of a large number of target genes due to lesser constraints imposed by the second mirna. in fact, many of these mirnas, such as the let- <dig> family, mir- <dig> family, mir- <dig> family, mir-140-3p, mir-30d, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-15a, and mir- <dig>  play an important role in development and differentiation  <cit> .

strand selection and precursor hairpin arms bias
finally, we asked whether highly expressed mirnas preferentially originate from the 5p or 3p strand of the hairpin precursor. in humans we indeed find such a bias: highly expressed mirnas originate more frequently from the 5p strand of the hairpin precursor for both the  <dig> biased mirna pairs and for all expressed mirnas . in fruit flies, however, we find no such tendency .

why would such a bias exist? one distinction between the two precursor arms is that the 5'-end of the mirnas originating from the 5p hairpin arm is determined by drosha, while for the 3p arm it is determined by dicer. since it is the 5'-end of a mirna that determines its target specificity, incorrect cleavage may result in an accumulation of aberrant mirna molecules. indeed, during mirna maturation, the 5'-end is cut more precisely than the 3'-end . still, if present in sufficiently high numbers, mirnas with an aberrant 5'-end are likely to have a detrimental effect. in humans, we find highly expressed mirnas to be biased towards the 5p hairpin arm. based on this observation, we speculate that the cutting accuracy of the 5p-specific enzyme, drosha, might be higher than that of dicer. indeed, we find that significantly fewer mirna sequences with an incorrect 5'-end originate from the 5p precursor than from the 3p precursor strand in humans  . we obtain the same result excluding all mirna precursors containing possible alternative 5'-end isoforms  <cit>   . other factors, such at non-template nucleotide addition or rna editing may influence heterogeneity of mirna ends. still, we do not expect these factors to differ in effect between 5p and 3p strands of mirna precursors. in contrast to humans, we did not observe any bias of highly expressed mirnas towards the 5p or 3p precursor strand in flies. in agreement with our hypothesis, in flies we also do not find any significant differences in mirna 5'-end cutting accuracy between the 5p and 3p hairpin arms  . this finding highlights another variation in mirna maturation machinery between humans and flies.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, analyzing sequence features underlying mirna strand selection bias in humans and flies, we find several outstanding features characterising human, but not fly mirnas. these features include a bias towards specific nucleotides at the 5-ends of both selected and excluded strands , and a pronounced purine/pyrimidine content difference between the two strands. we speculate that these additional sequence features may have evolved to facilitate discrimination between the two stands of the precursor duplex. such a mechanism might be particularly important for highly expressed precursor duplexes, when specific selection of one mirna species and elimination of the other one are required for efficient target gene regulation. further, we identify another feature distinguishing human and fly mirna processing machinery: the relative accuracy of the drosha and dicer enzymes. these findings indicate that human and fly mirna processing pathways are more distinct than currently recognized. further, as both accurate processing and correct selection of the mirna strand are crucial for rnai performance, the mirna sequence features described here are instrumental for the rational design of efficient mirna-based expression regulators.
