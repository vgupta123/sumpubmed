BACKGROUND
spore forms of bacillus anthracis once inhaled, germinate and multiply rapidly in lymph nodes that are in close proximity to lungs. subsequently the bacteria and its lethal toxin circulate into the blood stream, thereby causing death to the exposed subjects if untreated on time  <cit> . because of this lethal effect on humans and animals, b. anthracis is classified as a category-a bioweapon  <cit> . there are a number of double-stranded dna bacteriophages that specifically bind, infect and lyse host bacteria through the action of a family of enzymes called lysins that they encode  <cit> . one such enzyme, the γ-phage derived lysin plyg , was previously shown both in vitro and in a balb/c mouse model to selectively search and kill both b. anthracis and a rare variant susceptible to γ-phage, b. cereus- <dig>  <cit> .

the plyg like other members of the lysin family contains two domains, an n-terminal catalytic domain and a c-terminal domain that demonstrates high degree of binding specificity to the cell wall peptidoglycans of b. anthracis and its nonlethal surrogates  <cit> . previous analysis of plyg c-terminal region suggested that a domain spanning residues  <dig> to  <dig> of plyg is sufficient for binding to the b. anthracis cell and useful as a probe in detecting the bacteria  <cit> . deletion analysis of plyg 156– <dig> region further indicated that a plyg polypeptide lacking amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  lost its ability to bind to the bacteria, suggesting that this short region imparts binding activity to the plyg polypeptide  <cit> . by further mutational analysis, both l <dig> and q <dig> residues of lkmtadfilq sequence proved to be important for the binding activity of plyg  <cit> . in all these studies, larger polypeptides of plyg served as probes to detect the bacteria. however, whether short synthetic peptides containing lkmtadfilq amino acid sequence alone can selectively bind to the bacteria with similar specificity or the 10-amino acid sequence imparts cell wall binding capability only in the context of larger plyg protein is not known. if the former turns out to be true by experimental verification, then such short synthetic peptides will be useful in developing novel detection methods for b. anthracis by using its known surrogates, b. anthracis  vaccine strain and another γ-phage susceptible rare bacillus strain, b. cereus- <dig>  the advantage with short synthetic peptides is that large quantities of peptides in pure form can be synthesized. whereas, achieving purity of larger recombinant proteins often associates with inherent problems such as protein denaturation and misfolding, leading to loss of function  <cit> .

in this report, using four different methods, we evaluated six synthetic peptides representing the 10-amino acid plyg putative binding motif and its variant forms for the bacterial cell wall binding capacity. we successfully identified three synthetic peptides that are effective in selectively binding to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis  in spiked plasma.

RESULTS
synthetic plyg peptides that include lkmtadfilq residues demonstrate binding to both b. cereus- <dig> and vaccine strain of b. anthracis 
to test whether short synthetic peptide lkmtadfilq by itself can bind to the cell wall of b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis , we synthesized six peptides ranging between 10–20-mers within the c-terminal region of plyg between amino acid positions  <dig> to  <dig>  which encompass residues 190lkmtadfilq <dig> or its variants where l <dig> and q <dig> had substitutions. figure  <dig> illustrates the description of each peptide. we examined the binding capacity of these peptides to b. cereus- <dig>  b. anthracis-sterne, b. cereus- <dig>  b thuringiensis- <dig> and b. cereus- <dig> by four independent methods:  <dig>  dot-blot assay,  <dig>  elisa method,  <dig>  fluorometry and  <dig>  fluorescence-microscopy. in the later two methods, using bacteria-spiked plasma as the detection medium, the peptide bound to bacteria was detected by qdot-nanocrystal cores conjugated with streptavidin.

dot-blot based binding specificity analysis of the peptides
our results revealed that peptides plyg-p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> selectively bind to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne in the dot-blot assay while peptides plyg-p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> did not do so . none of the six peptides bound to b. cereus- <dig>  b. thuringiensis and b. cereus- <dig>  although these strains belong to bacillus group, which clearly demonstrates the binding specificity of the plyg-based peptides for b. anthracis-sterne and b. cereus- <dig> 

elisa based binding analysis of the peptides
since plyg peptides demonstrated specific binding to both b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne in the dot blot assay, we further evaluated the binding ability of these peptides to the bacteria in an elisa based assay. results of this assay method illustrated that peptide plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig> are strong binders  to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne while plyg-p <dig> has relatively lower binding; binding of rest of the peptides including the mutant forms were below the detection level . in this assay, none of the six peptides demonstrated binding to b. cereus- <dig>  b. thuringiensis and b. cereus- <dig> as is the case with the dot-blot method. statistical evaluation of the elisa results revealed that binding of plyg-p <dig>  plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig> to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne was significantly higher  than the binding of plyg-p <dig>  plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig> to the same bacteria.

streptavidin-conjugated quantum dot -based binding specificity analysis of the peptides
all six plyg peptides  were incubated individually with b. cereus- <dig>  b. anthracis-sterne, b. cereus- <dig>  b. thuringiensis, and b. cereus- <dig> cultures and binding of each peptide to the bacteria was detected using qdot-nanocrystal cores conjugated with streptavidin. analysis of human plasma spiked with the bacterial suspensions in a micro-well plate was performed using a fluorescence plate reader . excitation was set to a spectral range of 360– <dig> nm and emission was at  <dig> nm. fluorometric analysis revealed that in this experimental setting, plyg-p <dig>  plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig> were able to bind to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne as indicated by the significantly higher levels of fluorometric counts  compared to the samples containing plyg-p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  the analysis also confirmed that binding of peptides plyg-p <dig>  plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig> to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne was highly specific, as they did not cross-react with b. cereus- <dig>  b. thuringiensis, and b. cereus- <dig> .

fluorescence microscopy combined with qd-based binding sensitivity and specificity analysis of plyg-p3
experiments so far described in this report indicated that among the six peptides evaluated, plyg-p <dig> was the best binder with significantly higher binding  compared to others. therefore, we further attempted to confirm this peptide's binding and the limit of detection by a visual method such as fluorescence microscopy. briefly, human plasma samples spiked with ten-fold dilutions of bacillus cultures were incubated with plyg-p <dig> peptide for each dilution. following incubation, the bacteria-peptide complex was detected with the qdots under a fluorescence microscope . the analysis clearly identified that plyg-p <dig> peptide specifically binds to the outer surface of b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne bacterium, providing visual evidence that plyg-p <dig> peptide in combination with the qdot labeling method clearly enhances the detection sensitivity to a single bacterium in the spiked plasma .

discussion
in this study, our goal was to refine the previously known b. anthracis cell wall binding c-terminal 156– <dig> region of γ-phage lysin plyg by employing the minimal sequence as a synthetic peptide that would be useful as a bioprobe for the detection of b. anthracis. we have utilized an animal vaccine b. anthracis  and a rare γ-phage susceptible b. cereus- <dig> as surrogates for the strain, b. anthracis with respect to the cell wall binding ability of the synthetic peptides. in this analysis, we have also included other bacillus members, b. cereus- <dig>  b. thuringiensis and b. cereus- <dig> to serve as controls to illustrate the binding specificity of the synthetic peptides to the two surrogates. site-directed deletion analysis of plyg in the past has demonstrated that deletion of a short amino acid sequence in the c-terminal region encompassing a 10-amino acid motif  abrogated its binding activity targeted to the cell wall of bacillus anthracis. however, whether short synthetic peptides containing the 10-amino acid putative binding motif flanked by surrounding n- and c-terminal residues also selectively bind to the bacterial cell wall has not been evaluated.

as a first step, we synthesized six peptides derived from the plyg lysin polypeptide sequence encompassing the 185galtslkmtadfilqsdglt <dig> amino acid region  <cit> . the synthetic peptides were analyzed for their bacterial cell binding capability by using two surrogate strains in spiked plasma as a model for b. anthracis detection under bio-safety level  <dig>  conditions. previously it was shown that plyg protein bound to both b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis with equal affinity due to the identical nature of the cell wall surface as both these bacteria are the monomorphic isolates within the b. cereus lineage  <cit> .

our results clearly show that the 20-aa peptide plyg-p <dig> , the 15-aa plyg-p <dig>  and the 10-aa plyg-p <dig>  consistently demonstrated selective binding to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne in the membrane based dot-blot method . though all three peptides were able to show reactivity to the bacteria, the membrane assay does not reveal the quantitative nature of this binding. therefore, this estimation was achieved by the elisa and fluorometry assays wherein it was further confirmed that the plyg-p <dig>  plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig> not only bound very efficiently to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne but in addition there was a noticeable quantitative difference between their binding capacity as well. among the three peptides, plyg-p <dig> binding was significantly higher  than plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig>  the inability of the mutant peptides plyg-p <dig>  and plyg-p <dig>  binding to b. cereus- <dig> reaffirms a previous report that the l <dig> and q <dig> residues within the binding motif 190lkmtadfilq <dig> are critical in order for the larger plyg protein to bind to the bacterial cell wall  <cit> . however, it is interesting to note that plyg-p <dig>  lacking five residues 185galts <dig> also demonstrated its inability to bind to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne. this result suggest that while these five residues were not identified to be necessary for the binding of recombinant plyg 156– <dig> protein to the bacteria in a previous report  <cit> , in the context of shorter synthetic peptide binding ability to the bacteria, addition of these five residues to the n-terminus of 190lkmtadfilq <dig> sequence positively contributed to the binding activity. this further suggests that while 190lkmtadfilq <dig> region  is a deemed essential motif of lysin plyg for its binding to the host cell wall, a peptide containing additional five residues on the n-terminal side of this minimum motif seems to be a better peptide for bioprobe development. fluorometric analysis indicated that plyg-p <dig> and plyg-p <dig> were the strongest binders to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne. when combined with qdots, the detection sensitivity of plyg-p <dig> was enhanced to a single bacterium in the spiked plasma by florescence-microscopy. these findings are encouraging and open up novel strategies in the usage of some of these peptides coupled with qdots in developing diagnostics for b. anthracis.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of plyg-derived synthetic peptides suggest that three peptides  selectively bound to b. cereus- <dig> and b. anthracis-sterne, suggesting the validity of using these peptides as bioprobes for the detection of the two strains that serve as surrogates for b. anthracis with respect to their cell wall binding capacity. in addition, we identified a self-sufficient stand-alone bacterial cell-binding domain derived from the plyg protein to be useful as a bio-probe. the sensitivity of detection can be enhanced by using qdots in combination with the peptides.
