BACKGROUND
genome wide association studies  have greatly increased our understanding of the genetic basis of many complex diseases and traits by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms  that act as susceptibility factors for these diseases  <cit> . however, the results of gwas only give us a genomic region associated with a particular disease or trait, and the causal snp, gene and importantly, mechanism of action remain elusive. to date, only a handful of snps have been demonstrated as causal for a particular disease and the mechanism whereby the snp confers disease risk identified. for example, gwas has identified hundreds of loci associated with susceptibility to inflammatory or autoimmune diseases such as crohn’s disease, asthma, multiple sclerosis  and type  <dig> diabetes , furthering our understanding of the genetic basis of these diseases and identifying areas of the genome for further study  <cit> . however, apart from a variant in the immunity-related gtpase family, m  gene, which has been shown to confer susceptibility to crohn’s disease by altering mirna binding at the site of the snp  <cit> , the causal genes and mechanisms in most cases remain to be identified. the slow rate of progress in converting advances made by gwas into a fuller understanding of which genes are associated with disease, and their mechanistic actions, could be a reflection of the focus on protein coding variants, whereas most snps are in fact within non-coding regions of the gene  <cit> . at least 80% of the human genome has now been demonstrated to contain important regulatory sequences such as enhancers, silencers, small rna binding sites and chromatin modifiers  <cit> . an important mechanism of gene regulation, alternative splicing, is a complex process requiring over  <dig> splicing factors that recognise regulatory elements such as exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers , which bind trans-acting splicing regulatory factors  <cit>  that bind to the mrna secondary structure  <cit> . regulatory elements include the splice acceptor ag, the polypyrimidine tract, the splice donor gt and the branch site adenosine residue  <cit> . in addition disruption of any of these sequences has the potential to alter splicing by re-directing the spliceosome or by altering binding of auxiliary factors to exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers.

in this study, our aim was to follow a bioinformatic pipeline in order to identify autoimmune disease-associated variants with the potential to effect splicing, and to follow up interesting candidate variants by mrna analysis in whole blood, an appropriate tissue for the analysis of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. in this article, we report two variants in two genes that exhibit a genotype-associated effect on mrna processing of their host genes.

RESULTS
snps associated with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases are enriched for splice site variants
we performed a series of bioinformatic analyses to identify genetic variants that could potentially alter splicing of their host genes .  <dig> snps associated with one or more autoimmune diseases or inflammatory traits were identified that reached genome wide significance, and  <dig> proxies were identified to these index snps. of these,  <dig> snps were annotated as ‘splice_region_variant’ using the biomart program . when compared to  <dig> sets of  <dig> random snps and their proxies, we found that  <dig> % variants associated with autoimmune or inflammatory phenotypes were located in splice regions, compared with a mean of  <dig> % for randomly selected variants , indicating that inflammatory or autoimmune snps were enriched for splice site variants.

two snps in splice site regions were shown to produce alternative splice products
 <dig> variants were prioritised for further analysis on the basis that they had the potential to create cryptic splice sites, interrupt polypyrimidine tract sequences or disrupt regulatory elements involved in splicing. the  <dig> variants prioritised for further analysis using this pipeline are shown in table  <dig>  unusual bands were identified for half of the variants tested upon rt-pcr , rs <dig> , rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . two bands  were artifactual, and the remaining two  were further characterized and sequenced. we found no evidence of altered splicing caused by the remaining variants, although we cannot rule out splicing changes not identified because of primer placement or transcript levels.

the table shows the  <dig> snps that lie within splice sites of the genes listed. the index gwas autoimmune/ inflammatory snps that are in ld  with the splice site snps are shown, as well as the splice site prediction/location. pid pubmed accession, ld linkage disequilibrium.

rs <dig> causes two separate splicing changes in the gasdermin b  gene
we found two separate splicing changes associated with the variant rs <dig> in the gene gsdmb. these changes include production of a novel transcript of gsdmb and a change in isoform ratio. the novel band associated with rs <dig> was found upon sequence characterisation to be a large deletion product lacking exons 5– <dig> of the gene gsdmb . to determine whether this deletion was associated with genotype and therefore caused by the variant rs <dig>  we designed taqman assays to the wild-type and novel transcripts as described above from the custom assay service available from life technologies . we found evidence to suggest a genotype-associated effect on the expression levels of this deletion product; with homozygotes for the major  allele, showing increased expression of this alternate Δ5- <dig> transcript, and homozygotes for the minor  allele showing negligible expression of the transcript compared with heterozygous individuals or those homozygous for the a allele .

moreover, four reference transcript sequences are described for this gene in expressed sequence tag  databases; two transcripts  include exon  <dig>  whilst this exon is deleted in the remaining two . therefore, we quantified relative expression of these different isoforms according to genotype using taqman assays  . although there was no significant change in expression of the isoforms lacking exon  <dig>  we found that the isoforms which include exon  <dig> have almost no expression in homozygotes for the minor allele of rs <dig> compared with heterozygous individuals, and those homozygous for the a allele . this striking genotype-specific expression difference suggests that rs <dig> or an associated variant may be altering exon  <dig> inclusion in the gsdmb transcript. the alamut mutation interpretation software  predicted that rs <dig> would result in deletion of exon  <dig>  we also quantified expression of the wt transcript and overall expression of gsdmb, to determine whether these were altered by genotype. the expression differences between genotypes showed decreased expression for those individuals carrying the minor allele, although they did not reach statistical significance .

rs <dig> creates a cryptic donor splice site and alters splicing of the ts translation elongation factor, mitochondrial  gene.

we identified a novel band in carriers of the ‘t’ allele for rs <dig> which we were unable to isolate by conventional means due to the large size of the product. the size of the band  corresponded to a tsfm transcript with the inclusion of a short exon, where the donor site is created by rs <dig> and which has est  evidence of use  <cit> , but which is not present in the reference sequence  transcripts. this donor site is preceded by a strong acceptor site that is present 38 bp upstream of the variant, which also has evidence of use in est databases  <cit>  . we therefore designed rt-pcr primers specific to the predicted novel transcript, to confirm its identity. by this method, we were able to sequence the product and verify that the transcript includes a short 38 bp exon insertion within intron  <dig> of tsfm . expression of the novel transcript was found to be associated with genotype, with individuals carrying two minor  alleles expressing the novel transcript at levels approximately 2-fold higher than individuals carrying two major  alleles . however, we found no significant differences in expression between individuals of different genotypes for expression of total tsfm and tsfm wt.

variant rs <dig> is associated with two separate splicing changes in the gene gsdmb, which could possibly be of functional significance, whereas, the effect of rs <dig>  within tshm most likely has little functional consequence, since it is not affected by genotype. for the remaining  <dig> snps, we found no evidence for altered splicing. this could indicate that the snps in or near these splice sites were too weak to re-direct the splicing machinery, although it cannot be overlooked that the sensitivity of the assays may have affected identification of splice variants . alternatively, these genes may be differentially expressed in a tissue other than blood. nevertheless, variation in splicing regulatory sequences leading to aberrant splicing is a relatively common occurrence and may explain some of the signals identified by gwas  <cit> .

variant rs <dig>  a c > t change in intron  <dig> of the tsfm gene, was predicted to create a cryptic donor splice site within the intron, and transcripts derived from the use of this cryptic splice site, 38 bp downstream of a strong acceptor splice site, are represented in est databases  <cit> . we confirmed that the minor allele of the snp leads to the production of this alternative splice product, which includes the 38 bp short exon within intron  <dig>  negligible amounts of the insertion product  were expressed from the transcripts carrying the major  allele . the difference in age between genotypes in our cohort for the variant rs <dig> reached statistical significance, so it is possible that the effects we note for tsfm splicing could be driven by differences in mean age rather than genotype. the insertion of the novel 38 bp intron causes a frameshift event leading to the generation of a premature termination codon at a position 85 bp downstream of the insertion. this would in all probability render the novel transcript susceptible to the nonsense-mediated decay mrna surveillance pathway  <cit> . tsfm has been identified as a likely candidate gene in multiple sclerosis susceptibility  <cit> , and its expressio <dig>  para 2n was recently found to be correlated with a variant that alters an enhancer region  <cit> . therefore, since overall expression of all tsfm isoforms and of the four reference sequence isoforms  was not significantly altered by genotype, we conclude that the exon inclusion caused by the snp is unlikely to be of functional significance.

the genotype-specific splicing changes of the gsdmb gene may be of more potential importance. variant rs <dig>  an a > g change in the acceptor splice site of intron  <dig> of the gsdmb gene, is associated with two separate alternative splicing events. firstly the major  allele of rs <dig> is associated with exon skipping, resulting in a splice product missing exons 5– <dig> , whereas this does not occur in individuals carrying the minor  allele. the cause of the deletion is not easy to ascertain, but could be attributable to changes in the rna secondary structure induced by this snp, which could alter binding of the splicing machinery . it is also possible that another snp or snps in linkage disequilibrium  with rs <dig> may be causing this splicing alteration. although wt gsdmb and total gsdmb expression was decreased in those carrying the minor allele, these changes did not reach statistical significance, indicating that the disease susceptibility may be attributable to a gain of function effect from the novel transcript, rather than the amount of the gsdmb transcript pool . it is difficult however to speculate as to the effect of this large deletion on gsdmb protein function, since little is known about the structural function of this protein. secondly, we identified that subjects carrying the minor  allele of rs <dig> exhibit skipping of exon  <dig> of the gene, with homozygotes for the minor allele expressing very little full length product .

taken together, these changes indicate that whilst individuals homozygous for the major  allele do express the Δ5- <dig> deleted gsdmb product, they also express the full length exon 6-containing isoforms. conversely, individuals homozygous for the minor  allele do not express either the deleted gsdmb product or the full length product , as reflected in their lower overall expression. this may suggest some functional importance of the region of the gsdmb protein encoded by exon  <dig>  but there is very little information on the nature of this region in the current literature.

gsdmb encodes for the protein gasdermin b, which is a member of the gasdermin-domain containing protein family. although the exact function of gsdmb remains unclear, members of the gasdermin-domain containing family have roles in epithelial cell apoptosis and in maintaining a differentiated state of epithelial cells  <cit> . gsdmb has also been shown to be important in cancer pathogenesis, with alternative splicing of the gene being involved in gastrointestinal and hepatic cancers  <cit> . the gsdmb gene contains several conserved amino acid sequences in the n and c terminal regions as well as several conserved leucine-rich motifs throughout the sequence  <cit> . the deletion product described here, gsdmb nv, is in frame so would not be subject to nonsense-mediated decay and could plausibly be translated into the protein.

variant rs <dig> is located on chromosome 17q12- <dig>  in an area which was identified in  <dig> to be associated with asthma susceptibility , as well as susceptibility to developing several autoimmune diseases, including ulcerative colitis , crohn’s disease , type  <dig> diabetes  and primary biliary cirrhosis    <cit> . it is interesting to note that the risk alleles for allergic disease susceptibility are the alternative to that for autoimmune disease susceptibility, indicating opposite effects of the variants on pathogenesis of these diseases  <cit> . the minor allele for rs <dig>  increases risk for developing these autoimmune traits  and confers a decreased risk to developing asthma. this association has been replicated several times by independent groups and in different populations, and there has been much debate over potential mechanisms of action and which is the causal gene in that locus.

gsdmb, ormdl <dig>  and zpbp <dig>  have all been considered good candidates, as they are all expression quantitative trait loci, with opposite directions of expression seen with genotype for ormdl3/gsdmb and zpbp <dig>  at present, the best functional evidence of the mechanism by which the 17q12- <dig> locus may alter asthma and autoimmune disease susceptibility comes from two studies by the same group, who identified a  <dig>  kb region overlapping the zpbp <dig> gene, which is associated with several gene regulatory marks, including allele-specific chromatin interactions, dna methylation and promoter activity  <cit> . it has been hypothesised that this regulatory region may be involved in long-range chromatin interactions and may influence the expression of any one or all of the genes gsdmb, ormdl <dig> and zpbp <dig> <cit> .

zpbp <dig> has a well-known role in fertilisation and male fertility, and it has been proposed that this gene may play a role in influencing the prevalence of asthma in the population  <cit> . ormdl <dig> has so far been thought to be the most promising candidate at this locus, since it has a role in mediating inflammation, and also has expression in bronchial epithelial cells, where slightly higher ormdl <dig> expression was found in individuals with asthma compared to controls  <cit> . gsdmb shows a diverse expression pattern in tissues, including expression in the lung, liver, intestine and colon, but with very low expression in bronchial epithelial cells. however, it has been suggested that the effect of the chromosome 17q12- <dig> locus on multiple diseases may reflect a more direct role on immune function rather than any tissue-specific effect  <cit> . the expression of gsdmb in the thymus and cd8+ and cd4+ t-cells would increase the plausibility of this inference, especially given the involvement of type  <dig> and type  <dig> immune responses in autoimmune and allergic disease respectively  <cit> .

although genome-wide analysis of transcript isoform expression in the ceu hapmap population found no differences in the expression of gsdmb isoform ratios associated with the asthma haplotype in lcls   <cit> , the splicing of gsdmb has been shown to be associated with genotype of the related variant rs <dig> in brain and in peripheral blood mononucleated cells  <cit> . rs <dig> is in the same ld block as rs <dig> , and our data thus suggest the effect on splicing noted in this, and in our study may be an effect of the splice site snp rs <dig>  interestingly heinzen et al. found an overrepresentation of autoimmune traits associated with splicing quantitative trait loci , which could indicate the importance of splicing differences in these diseases  <cit> . finally, lcls may not offer a realistic representation of regulation of in vivo gene expression  <cit> , explaining the differences in gsdmb splicing patterns seen in primary cell types and lcls.

these data are of course preliminary in nature, and require further work to assess the potential consequences of a reduction in gsdmb expression, or an alteration to the pool of transcripts expressed from the gsdmb gene to the function of tissues involved in immune function and inflammation. future studies should focus on the effect of alterations to the gsdmb isoform pool on factors such as the inflammatory milieu in other appropriate cell types to prove causality and further define mechanism. it remains to be seen also if gsdmb splicing changes are also noted in individuals with asthma and autoimmune diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, we have demonstrated that a proportion of genetic variants identified as susceptibility loci for inflammatory or autoimmune disease may act by disrupting the native splicing patterns of their host genes. using bioinformatics to identify variants likely to interfere with splicing patterns, followed by functional evaluation in whole blood, we have demonstrated alterations in the splicing of the gsdmb and tsfm genes, which is associated with genotype at rs <dig> and rs <dig> respectively. although the exon inclusion caused by the variant in tsfm is unlikely to have any functional significance, our data suggest that rs <dig> is associated with the production of a novel gsdmb transcript lacking an internal segment, together with a change in the ratio of some known isoforms. this is predicted to result in an almost complete lack of full length gsdmb mrna in individuals homozygous for the minor allele. although the functional significance of these changes remains to be determined, our study provides further evidence that gsdmb is a promising candidate gene at the 17q12- <dig> locus, in altering susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, and asthma.
