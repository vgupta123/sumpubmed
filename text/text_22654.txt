BACKGROUND
apoptosis is the most common process of programmed cell death  in eukaryotes. it is vital for the fast elimination of useless or injured cells, and for the differential development of tissues and organs. in humans the malfunction of this process leads to severe diseases, namely neurodegenerative disorders, aids and cancer. the existence of pcd processes in lower eukaryotes or bacteria was for long disregarded due to the absence of obvious benefits for unicellular organisms. nonetheless, numerous works contributed to evidence pcd occurring in single cell organisms  <cit> , as well as to the establishment of yeast as a good model to study mechanisms of apoptotic regulation  <cit> . multicellular aggregates of microbial cells, like colonies or biofilms, are spatially organized and require the specialization of cells differentially localized to ensure supply of nutrients and water to the whole cell ensemble  <cit> . the growing concept that microbial multicellular aggregates form functional and higher organized structures, as a kind of proto-tissue, supports the notion that pcd may be a much more spread and conserved mechanism of cellular altruistic behaviour.

the characteristic apoptotic markers, as dna fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, chromatin condensation, release of cytochrome c, and/or caspases activation are also valid to assess apoptotic yeast cells  <cit> . furthermore, an increasing list of homologues of apoptotic regulators in metazoans has been identified in yeast, such as yca1p, the proposed yeast caspase  <cit> ; aifp, the apoptosis inducing factor  <cit> ; endog, an endonuclease which regulates not only life but also death in yeast  <cit> ; nma111p, a yeast htra-like protein  <cit> ; bir1p, an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein  <cit>  and ybh3p, a yeast protein that interacts with bcl-xl and harbours a functional bh <dig> domain  <cit> . additionally, the expression in s. cerevisiae of the mammalian bcl- <dig> family and pkc isoforms  <cit> , led to the same phenotypes observed in mammalian cells, providing evidence that apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. several agents can induce yeast pcd, like hydrogen peroxide, uv radiation, the absence of nutrients, hyper-osmotic stress, acetic acid  <cit>  and aging  <cit> . aging in yeast can be studied assessing either replicative or chronological lifespan. replicative lifespan is defined as the number of daughter cells a single yeast mother cell produces before senescence; chronological lifespan is defined by the length of time cells can survive in a non-dividing, quiescence-like state  <cit> . chronological aged yeast cells also exhibit typical apoptotic markers. during chronological aging, the old yeasts die and release certain substances  into the medium in order to promote survival of other aged cells, yet fitter ones  <cit> .

on the other hand, it has been demonstrated that apoptotic s. cerevisiae cells display changes in the expression of some genes associated with the sphingolipids metabolism  <cit> , which is consistent with changes in the proportions of the various sphingolipid types in dying cells  <cit> . carmona-guitierrez and co-authors  <cit>  observed the apoptosis induction by external addition of c2-ceramide, whereas barbosa and co- authors reported changes in sphingolipids during chronological aging, namely a decrease of dihydrosphingosine levels and an increase of dihydro-c -ceramide and phyto-c -ceramide levels  <cit> . also, a role in apoptosis and aging of ydc1p ceramidase was described  <cit> , and a yeast homologue of mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase  <dig> was associated with apoptosis  <cit> . moreover, some intermediates in sphingolipids biosynthesis act as signalling molecules and growth regulators  <cit> . nevertheless, modest attention has been paid to the involvement of sphingolipids in yeast pcd.

in s. cerevisiae, sphingolipids are mainly located in the plasma membrane, being more concentrated along the sphingolipid-sterol rich domains  <cit> , commonly named rafts. these domains play fundamental roles in connecting the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton, er and golgi, and therefore in the correct protein sorting and trafficking through exocytosis/endocytosis  <cit> . moreover, rafts harbour signalling molecules besides sphingolipids, like kinases, pi2p , and gpi -anchored proteins  <cit> . the latter, are proteins attached to the plasma membrane via a lipid anchor that contains either a ceramide or diacylglycerol  <cit> . gup1p is a membrane-bound o-acyltransferase  <cit>  involved in lipid metabolism, rafts integrity and assembly  <cit>  and gpi anchor remodelling  <cit> . this protein was primarily identified associated with phenotypes on glycerol metabolism and transport  <cit> , but has further been implicated in a vast number of distinct processes, namely cell wall structure, composition and biogenesis  <cit> , plasma membrane assembly and composition  <cit> , cytoskeleton polarization and bud site selection  <cit> , and telomere length  <cit> , all of which directly or indirectly associated with apoptosis. this work presents evidence that cells lacking gup <dig> are not able of undergoing apoptosis, as revealed by the analysis of several apoptotic markers . instead the mutant appears to be experiencing a necrotic cell death process, upon both chronological aging and acetic acid induction. this result adds to the growing view that as in higher eukaryotes, lipids are involved in signalling pcd in yeast.

RESULTS
gup <dig> is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, some of which are associated directly or indirectly with apoptosis, such as rafts integrity and lipids metabolism  <cit> , cytoskeleton polarization  <cit> , and telomere length  <cit> . in the present work, we assess apoptotic markers for gup1∆ mutant strain and compare them with wt, under two different conditions documented to induce apoptosis in yeast: chronological aging and acetic acid  <cit> .

gup1∆ mutant cells exhibit a reduction in chronological lifespan
yeast chronological lifespan is described as the length of time a population remains viable in the non-dividing/stationary phase  <cit> . chronologically aged yeast cells die exhibiting specific markers of apoptosis  <cit> . we checked the survival of gup1∆ chronologically aged cells in comparison to wt, continuously for  <dig> days throughout stationary phase until complete death of the culture.

the growth curve  showed an apparent similar growth rate for both strains during exponential phase, as well as an almost coincident transition to diauxic and stationary phases. on the other hand, the survival curve  showed that gup1∆ mutant cells died considerably sooner than wt. after day  <dig> the survival rate of gup1∆ mutant started to decrease, reaching 50% around day  <dig>  and in day  <dig> we observed that only a small number of gup1∆ mutant cells stayed alive. conversely, wt strain begins to die around day  <dig>  reaches 50% survival at day  <dig> and on day  <dig> the culture was practically dead.

chronological aged gup1∆ mutant seems to be incapable of dying by apoptosis but rather by necrosis
in order to investigate whether chronologically aged wt and gup1∆ mutant cells die by apoptosis, we analyzed several apoptotic markers in exponentially growing and chronologically aged cultures on both strains  <cit> . we choose  <dig> hours growth to assess exponential cells, and day  <dig> or day  <dig> to test chronologically aged cells of gup1∆ mutant and wt, respectively.

in yeast, as in mammalian cells, the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity during cell death is an indicator of apoptosis. in this work, we evaluated the integrity of plasma membrane, in exponential and aged wt and gup1∆ mutant strains, by pi staining. in gup1∆ mutant, we observed a substantial increase in the number of cells stained with pi over time, until every cell presented pi positive. still, although the pattern is identical, in wt the percentage of pi positive cell was proximally 2-fold less . yet, the percentages of pi positive cells can be over evaluated since apoptotic cells can become leaky during further cultivation, increasing pi positives. to distinguish this secondary necrosis from primary necrosis further tests were performed.

phosphatidylserine has an asymmetric distribution in the lipid bilayer of the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . the exposure of phosphatidylserine at the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane occurs at the early stages of apoptosis  <cit> , when membrane integrity is still retained. we checked this through the fitc-coupled annexin v reaction followed by flow cytometry of co-labeled annexin v/pi cells. we observed that gup1∆ mutant aging cells presents a significant percentage  of necrotic cells /pi). in contrast, in wt cells the exposure of phosphatidylserine /pi ) increased in aged cells  .

in order to evaluate the mitochondrial membrane depolarization, dioc <dig> was used. at a concentration of  <dig> ng/ml this dye accumulates specifically at mitochondrial membranes and can be observed by fluorescence microscopy. nonetheless, cells that have low mitochondrial membrane potential will fail to accumulate dioc <dig> <cit> . both gup1∆ mutant and wt exponential cells stained with dioc <dig> revealed intact mitochondrial networks, confirming a normal polarization of mitochondrial membranes . aged cells , showed a decrease in green fluorescence of approximately 40% in wt and 50% in gup1∆ mutant, reflecting a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential . moreover, some cells exhibited a strong green fluorescence all over the cell, mainly in gup1∆ mutant strain, suggesting that these cells possibly had the plasma membrane altered, which in turn resulted in the accumulation of dioc <dig> on the cytosol .

finally, we evaluated chromatin condensation through dapi staining . moderate chromatin condensation upon dapi staining was observed in 80% of old gup1∆ mutant cells, which can be visualized by the fluorescent semicircles formed by the chromatin fragments . regarding wt aged cells, we observed some cells with chromatin condensation, but we also detected cells without stained nucleus or even with multiples nucleus . these are probably due to an endomitosis process  <cit> . in contrast, in exponentially growing cultures, both wt and gup1∆ mutant cells presented integral chromatin mirrored as single round fluorescent circles in the middle of the cell .

gup1∆ mutant cells are sensitive to acetic acid
in a previous work, it was described that gup1∆ mutant cells were sensitive to weak acids  <cit> . however, the concentrations of acetic acid that induce apoptosis in yeast are considerably higher than the ones studied at that time . therefore, we investigated gup1∆ mutant and wt sensitivity to a wide range of acid concentrations . with the lowest concentration of acetic acid , no effect was observed; however, when the concentration was increased both strains were affected, being gup1∆ mutant strain the most sensitive one. at the highest concentration tested,  <dig> mm of acetic acid, the difference between the two strains was more obvious, with gup1∆ mutant showing growth only until the second dilution, whereas wt presents growth up to the fourth dilution . additionally, we determined the death kinetics of both strains treated with  <dig> mm of acetic acid , as commonly assayed to evaluate apoptosis induced by acetic acid  <cit> . for that, wt and gup1∆ mutant cells at exponential growth phase were exposed to acetic acid, and the survival rate measured by c.f.u. counts. in both cases, the yeast cells died in response to acetic acid, but the cell death patterns were different. until  <dig> min of acetic acid treatment, no significant difference was found between wt and gup1∆ mutant strains, presenting around 90% and 85% cell viability, respectively. these percentages progressively decreased in both strains, being this reduction more accentuated in the gup1∆ mutant strain. after  <dig> min in the presence of acetic acid, only 15% of gup1∆ mutant cells remained alive, whereas wt presented a survival rate of around 75%. at the last time-point analyzed,  <dig> min, the dissimilarity among strains sharpened up; only a few cells of gup1∆ mutant strain were viable, whereas wt strain displayed a survival rate of around 55% .

acetic acid induces cell death by necrosis similar to that triggered by chronological aging in the gup1∆ mutant strain
in order to assess whether cell death induced by acetic acid treatment followed a programmed process of apoptosis, we analyzed several apoptotic markers. the first marker analyzed was pi staining to estimate the loss of membrane integrity. acetic acid treatment led to a pronounced increase of gup1∆ mutant pi positive cells, reached nearly 100% after  <dig> min of treatment, while in the wt strain this percentage did not exceed 10% . in addition, we examined the phosphatidylserine exposure by simultaneously fitc- coupled annexin v/pi staining . similarly to what was observed with the aging experiment, a substantial increase  in necrotic cells /pi) were observed after treatment with acetic acid . in opposition, wt strain presents an increase  in apoptotic cells /pi) after the treatment with acetic acid .

yeast mitochondria undergo both structural and functional changes after the incubation with acetic acid  <cit> , including mitochondrial membrane depolarization. in order to evaluate this phenomenon, dioc <dig> staining was used to visualize mitochondrial membranes . just before apoptosis induction with acetic acid, most of wt and gup1∆ mutant cells presented intact mitochondrial networks . after the treatment, it was possible to visualize depolarization of mitochondrial membranes in approximately 40% and 30% of gup1∆ mutant and wt cells, respectively, mirrored by the absence of fluorescence . furthermore, we observed a considerable number of gup1∆ mutant cells displayed an increase in dioc <dig> green fluorescence, similarly to the results obtained when the apoptotic inductor was chronological aging .

additionally, we checked for chromatin condensation during acetic acid treatment by staining cells with dapi . nearly no chromatic condensation was observed in both gup1∆ mutant and wt untreated cells, as reflected by the single round fluorescent circles in the center of the cells . yet, after the treatment with acetic acid, we observed a significant increase in gup1∆ mutant cells exhibiting moderate chromatin condensation along the nuclear envelope . in wt, ~25% of cells presented chromatin condensation .

gup1∆ mutant cells accumulate large amounts of ros during chronological aging and acetic acid treatment
it is well documented that the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential can lead to increased production of ros in higher eukaryotes, which is seen as an apoptotic-related process in yeasts  <cit> . on the other hand, several points of evidence indicate that, in yeast, the accumulation of ros is a major factor determining aging  <cit>  and triggering pcd  <cit> . the accumulation of ros is commonly measured by incubating cells with dihydroethidium , which is oxidized  to the ethidium. ros were measured on both chronologically aged and acid acetic treated gup1∆ mutant and wt cells. regarding chronological assay, this covered exponential, stationary and death phases . a significantly higher increase of ros levels over time was observed in gup1∆ mutant in comparison to wt cells. the biggest difference was on day  <dig> , when the percentage of gup1∆ mutant cells exhibiting ros accumulation was the twice  that of wt cells . the mutant reached 100% of cells with ros accumulation on day  <dig>  while wt took  <dig> days to reach that state . still regarding gup1∆ mutant, the 100% ros was maintained till the end of experiment , which is in agreement with the observed death of these strain cells . the difference between wt and gup1∆ mutant strains was also extremely notorious in acetic acid treated cells . soon after acetic acid addition, gup1∆ mutant exhibited ros accumulation in ~ 8% of the cells, whereas wt presented less than 1%. this difference was accentuated with time. at one hour treatment gup1∆ mutant cells with ros accumulation was higher than 30% and wt cells less than 5%. two hours treatment led to a substantial rise of ros positive gup1∆ mutant cells  compared with only ~10% of wt. at the end of the treatment, almost all gup1∆ mutant cells exhibited ros accumulation, in clear contrast with the ~15% of ros accumulation displayed by wt strain .

discussion
the finding of an endogenous pcd process with an apoptotic phenotype has turned yeast into a powerful model for apoptosis research  <cit> . in fact, s. cerevisiae commits to cell death showing typical features of mammalian apoptosis, in response to different stimuli. however, how cell compounds participate in the processes leading to cell death in yeast remains to be established. gup1p, an o-acyltransferase, is required for several cellular processes that are related to apoptosis development, namely, rafts integrity and stability, lipid metabolism including gpi anchor correct remodeling, proper mitochondrial and vacuole function, and actin dynamics  <cit> .

in this work we used two known apoptosis-inducing conditions, chronological aging  <cit>  and acetic acid  <cit> , to assess several apoptotic markers in gup1∆ mutant strain. we found that, when compared with wt, gup1∆ mutant presents a significant reduced chronological lifespan, showing almost no viability after  <dig> days incubation. chronologically aged yeast cultures were shown to die exhibiting typical apoptotic markers  <cit> . accordingly, we showed that chronologically aged wt cells predominantly commit to an apoptotic death, as revealed by a) pi negative cells; b) phosphatidylserine externalization; c) depolarization of mitochondrial membrane; and d) chromatin condensation. yet, gup1∆ mutant aged cells seem to be incapable of undergoing apoptosis. instead, these cells appeared to be experiencing a necrotic cell death process. the gup1∆ mutant aged culture exhibited a higher number of cells with loss of membrane integrity, and did not reveal an increase of phosphatidylserine exposure on the surface of the plasma membrane. such observations discredit the possibility that these cells are dying through an apoptotic process, being more likely that the reduction in lifespan is due to a necrotic death. furthermore, both loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and moderate chromatin condensation that we observed in this mutant have already been described in necrotic phenotypes  <cit> . lately, several points of evidence suggest that necrotic cell death also occurs in yeast. moreover, that can occur under normal physiological conditions or in the presence of cell death inducing substances, and not necessarily resulting from brutal chemical or physical damage, as previously thought  <cit> .

we also used acetic acid as an apoptotic inducer of cell death in both wt and gup1∆ mutant strains. our results revealed that acetic acid induces a cell death process similar to that observed in aging cultures. these results are in accordance with the hypothesis proposed in a previous work, in which the toxicity of acetic acid produced during aging was suggested as the major cause of chronological aging in yeast  <cit> . reinforcing such idea are the acidified cultures that we observed during aging, probably resulting from acetic acid production and release to the medium . moreover, it was also reported that the signaling of acetic acid-induced apoptosis is linked to amino-acid metabolism as well as to the tor pathway  <cit> , as it happens in the aging process  <cit> . a necrotic death induced by acetic acid was already observed in other yeast mutants, namely in mutants in class c vps genes that code for proteins essential for vacuolar and endossomal vesicle function  <cit> .

accumulation of ros has predominantly been associated to yeast apoptosis under numerous conditions  <cit> . some studies have addressed a fundamental role of ros on the execution apoptotic death, after treatment with low doses of hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  and on the superoxide-mediated altruistic program of aging  <cit> . interestingly, however, many studies have suggested a crucial involvement of ros during necrosis of mammalian cells  <cit>  as well as in yeast necrosis  <cit> . this evidence is in accordance with our results. we observed a significant difference in ros accumulation between wt and gup1∆ mutant strain in both chronological aging and acetic acid treatment. gup1∆ mutant cells, which present a necrotic phenotype, have an extremely higher accumulation of ros. if ros can contribute, apart from its role on apoptosis, to the necrotic cell death in yeast as well, or if it is rather a byproduct that accumulates as a result of cellular demise, remains to be elucidated.

gup1p has been described to have an important function on lipid rafts assembly/integrity  <cit> . in the literature, rafts have been increasingly implicated on regulation of apoptotic signaling in mammalian cells  <cit> . in response to intra or extracellular stimuli, lipid rafts can include or exclude proteins to variable extents. this favors specific protein-protein interactions and modulates the activity of signalling apoptotic cascades. moreover, in mammalian cells a number of proteins involved in apoptotic signals have been found to locate in lipid rafts, namely fas/cd <dig> receptor  <cit>  and the pro-apoptotic protein of bcl- <dig> family, bad  <cit> . our results showed that the pcd processes in s. cerevisiae is altered by gup <dig> deletion and reinforce the importance of lipid rafts on the regulation of apoptotic signaling in yeast. moreover, our findings point to that these membrane domains seem to be indispensable for a proper development of pcd, under aging and acetic acid conditions, namely in the switch from a necrotic to an apoptotic death phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that gup1∆ mutant strain present a significantly reduced chronological lifespan comparing to wt. moreover, this mutant showed to be highly sensitive to acetic acid. yet, while chronologically aged and acetic acid treated wt cells die exhibiting apoptotic markers, gup1∆ mutant cells under the same conditions seems to be incapable of undergoing apoptosis. instead, these cells appeared to be experiencing a necrotic cell death process. in addition, those cells also present extremely high levels of ros. being gup1∆ mutant affected in lipid rafts integrity/assembly, lipid metabolism and gpi anchor remodeling we propose that the integrity of rafts may be essential for apoptosis induction and/or signaling. this provides for the first time the possible participation of lipid rafts in yeast apoptosis, giving new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this particular process of pcd, and highlighting the complex network of cellular structures that interact, cooperate and compete to regulate cell death.
