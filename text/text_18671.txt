BACKGROUND
pyrethroid-treated bednets are the mainstay of malaria control programs in sub-saharan africa  <cit> . pyrethroids are a class of fast acting and highly effective insecticides showing low mammalian toxicity levels. currently no other insecticide class with similar efficacy and specificity is available for use on bednets. therefore the emergence of pyrethroid resistance threatens to compromise the successful use of insecticide-treated materials  <cit> .

two mechanisms of insecticide resistance play an important role in mosquitoes, target site insensitivity and metabolic resistance  <cit> . target site insensitivity to pyrethroids in anopheles gambiae is associated with a single point mutation, commonly referred to as knock-down resistance . the kdr allele leads to a modification of the voltage-gated sodium channel protein resulting in reduced sensitivity to both ddt and pyrethroids  <cit> . metabolic resistance is generally associated with three enzyme families: cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , carboxylesterases , and glutathione-s-transferases   <cit> . in a. gambiae a total of  <dig> putative p450s,  <dig> coes, and  <dig> gsts genes have been identified  <cit> . though the groups contain large numbers of genes, these enzyme families have multiple roles in the insect and only a small number are thought to be directly involved in insecticide metabolism. enzymes from all three families have been implicated in conferring resistance to pyrethroids in other insect species . in a. gambiae increased levels have been observed for the gste <dig> transcript in the permethrin tolerant rsp strain from western kenya  <cit> . increased expression of gste <dig> was also observed in the zan/u strain, from zanzibar, resistant to ddt  <cit> . gste <dig> transforms ddt into a non-toxic product by dehydrochlorination  <cit> . however, its role in detoxifying pyrethroids requires further investigations. in addition to elevated expression of gste <dig>  over-expression of two p <dig> genes, cyp6z <dig> and cyp325a <dig>  was observed in adult mosquitoes of the rsp strain  <cit> .

current data on gene expression levels related to metabolic resistance in a. gambiae is limited to strains from east africa that were colonised over a decade ago. despite the high levels of pyrethroid resistance found in malaria vectors in west africa  <cit>  there have been no previous studies on gene expression patterns associated with metabolic resistance mechanisms operating in this region.

noteworthy, studies on kdr revealed different alleles to be predominant in east and west african field populations suggesting that alternative mutations may evolve in response to insecticide exposure  <cit> . given the differences in selection pressures due to variations in the use and type of insecticide, and possible restrictions to gene flow across the african continent  <cit> , we would predict similar differences in metabolic resistance mechanisms.

the presence of multiple resistance mechanisms within a. gambiae would have considerable implications for the success of vector intervention and the monitoring of ongoing control programs, demanding the development of appropriate tools to monitor resistance in field populations. the development of such tools requires the identification of candidate genes, and with this goal in mind, we used the detox chip, a custom-made dna microarray chip, developed in our laboratories  <cit> , to measure expression patterns in a recently colonised pyrethroid resistant strain from southern ghana.

RESULTS
gene expression associated with resistance status
the expression levels of genes putatively involved in insecticide resistance were compared by co-hybridising labelled rna from the pyrethroid resistant odumasy strain and the standard susceptible kisumu strain to a custom made microarray  <cit> . as both sexes of the resistant odumasy strain showed high resistance to permethrin hybridisations were performed for both females and males. percentage survival after a one hour exposure to  <dig> % permethrin, although statistically significant , differed only slightly between sexes with 74%  for females and 62%  for males. out of  <dig> gene probes on the microarray,  <dig> genes were significantly  differentially expressed among females, and  <dig> genes among males, between the two strains . among these genes  <dig> are common to both sexes and showed the same expression patterns . of particular interest are genes that show increased transcript levels in both sexes of the resistant strain. we set a cut-off value of two-fold differential expression to select biologically relevant candidate genes among those showing a significant difference in transcript levels, and focus on genes that are over-expressed in both sexes of the resistant strain.

in total, ten genes showed a greater than two-fold difference in expression between the strains . six of these genes were expressed at higher levels in the odumasy strain and four showed higher expression in the susceptible strain. the genes over-expressed in the resistant strain include three cytochrome p450s , a sigma class gst , a carboxylesterase, coejhe5e, and a superoxide dismutase . gsts1- <dig> was over-expressed in females while cyp6z <dig> over-expression was detected in males only. in both males and females, the most pronounced differences were in the expression of two cyp <dig> p450s, cyp6m <dig> and cyp6z <dig>  cyp6z <dig> was significantly over-expressed  in males but the data for the female comparison was not significant. this may reflect the very low expression levels of this gene in adult mosquitoes rather than any sex specific differences in expression . indeed the female-male comparisons did not detect any differential expression of this gene . all three p450s over-expressed in the resistant strain are clustered in a group of  <dig> cyp <dig> genes on chromosome arm 3r  <cit> .

two of the transcripts over-expressed in the resistant strain are derived from genes with alternative splicing. two transcripts have been detected from the superoxide dismutase gene, sod <dig> , one of which  shows elevated expression in both males and females from the resistant strain. both sod3b and the alternative transcript sod3a share a common n terminal but differ in their c termini. sod3a transcripts are detectable in both male and female a. gambiae although in the kisumu strain, the sod3b transcript is consistently found at higher levels . the sigma class gst, gsts <dig>  also contains a common 5' exon that can be spliced to alternative 3' exons generating two distinct transcripts, gsts1- <dig> and gsts1- <dig>  <cit> . as for sod <dig> both transcripts are detectable by quantitative rt-pcr in adults from both sexes  <cit> . the data from this study shows elevated expression of both transcripts in females from the resistant strain versus females from the susceptible strain  but no significant difference between the males.

four genes were expressed at higher levels in the susceptible versus the resistant strain . surprisingly these include gste <dig>  the gene associated with both pyrethroid and ddt resistance in a. gambiae from east africa  <cit> . one p <dig>  cyp6p <dig> is a member of a cluster of nine p <dig> genes on chromosome arm 2r  <cit>  while the second, cyp6aj <dig> , is located on chromosome arm 3l and has also been found under-expressed in the ddt resistant zan/u strain  <cit> . the fourth gene, px <dig>  is a peroxidase. as for cyp6z <dig>  px <dig> is expressed at very low levels in both strains. hence it is possible that small differences in absolute transcript levels, which could be an outcome of genetic drift, may have resulted in the strong differentiation in expression of this gene between the strains.

gene expression associated with sex
in two strains of a. gambiae from east africa, rsp and kisumu, females were found to be intrinsically more tolerant to permethrin than males  <cit> . in the present study, the survival rates between the sexes in the resistant odumasy strain differed only marginally. in order to assess whether this similarity in permethrin tolerance was correlated with expression of specific detoxification genes, labelled rna from both sexes of the susceptible kisumu strain was co-hybridised to the detox chip. gene expression profiles between females and males of the pyrethroid resistant odumasy strain were then indirectly estimated by comparing the data sets of all three microarray experiments, i.e. odumasy females vs. kisumu females, kisumu females vs. kisumu males, and kisumu males vs. odumasy males.

out of  <dig> gene probes on the microarray  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between the sexes in the kisumu strain and  <dig> in the odumasy strain . among these genes ten showed a difference over two-fold in the kisumu strain and  <dig> in the odumasy strain . if one or more of the three enzymes, cyp6z <dig>  cyp6m <dig> and sod3b, played a major role in permethrin resistance we would expect similar levels of expression in both sexes of the resistant strain, given that the resistance phenotype between females and males differed only slightly. none of these candidate genes was differentially expressed between females and males of the resistant odumasy strain .

eight genes found to be over-expressed by two-fold are common to both strains only in males . of these eight genes the p450s, cyp307a <dig> and cyp314a <dig>  show particularly high male biased expression. orthologs of these genes along with cyp306a <dig> have been implicated in ecdysteroid metabolism in other insects  <cit> . the expression of genes involved in ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone synthesis is tightly regulated and it is unlikely that these p450s play a major role in xenobiotic detoxification. in contrary, the five additional genes cyp6s <dig>  cyp6s <dig>  cyp6z <dig>  cyp12f <dig> and cyp325a <dig> belong to p <dig> families in which individual genes are associated with permethrin resistance .

the over-expression of cyp307a <dig> in males is confirmed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr . nikou et al.  <cit> , using quantitative rt-pcr, found cyp6z <dig> also being over-expressed in males over females in the susceptible kisumu strain in accordance with the microarray results in this study. over-expression of cyp6m <dig> in kisumu males over females was slightly higher in the semi-quantitative rt-pcr but was statistically not significant . however, the semi-quantitative rt-pcr is limited to the detection of very large fold changes and may not be sensitive enough to detect the lower fold change of cyp6m <dig>  we are confident in our microarray results as the quantitative rt-pcr  <cit>  and the overall pattern of the semi-quantitative rt-pcr are consistent with the microarray measurements.

discussion
monitoring of metabolic resistance to insecticides in field populations currently relies on biochemical assays. these assays measure the correlation between increased enzymatic activities towards model substrates in resistant mosquitoes and are a general indicator of the enzyme families putatively involved. however, the sensitivity of these assays is questionable. for example, recently lumjuan et al.  <cit>  have shown that the gst responsible for ddt resistance, gste <dig>  has very low levels of activity against the model substrate cdnb used to detected gst-based resistance mechanisms. synergists, such as piperonyl butoxide can also be used to indicate the enzyme class involved although these require large numbers of live insects and hence are not practical for routine monitoring of resistance in field populations. molecular tools such as the allele specific pcr  <cit>  or the hola  <cit>  assay developed to detect kdr mutations enable the frequency of resistance alleles to be measured directly. we still lack such tools to monitor metabolic resistance. yet, this information is extremely valuable to mosquito control managers as it enables resistance to be detected when it first emerges in a population and before it may have a detectable effect on the resistance phenotype. however, the development of such molecular assays requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms conferring resistance.

in the present study we identified six genes whose expression levels are associated with pyrethroid resistance in a recently colonised strain of a. gambiae from west africa. three of these six genes were over-expressed in both sexes of the resistant strain; two cytochrome p450s, cyp6z <dig> and cyp6m <dig>  and a member of the superoxide dismutase gene family, sod3b. in females of the resistant strain the carboxylesterase coejhe5e and a sigma class gst, gsts1- <dig>  were also found to be over-expressed while another p <dig>  cyp6z <dig>  was over-expressed in the resistant males only.

cytochrome p450-dependent monooxygenases are an important metabolic mechanism by which several insect species become resistant to insecticides  <cit> . biochemical characterisation implicate p450s conferring pyrethroid resistance in the resistant east african a. gambiae rsp strain  <cit> . in a. gambiae p <dig> loci associated with pyrethroid resistance are mapped within a cluster in chromosome arm 3r  <cit> . this cluster also encompasses the three p450s, cyp6z <dig>  cyp6z <dig> and cyp6m <dig>  identified in this study among a subfamily of  <dig> cyp <dig> p450s. as survival rates after exposure to permethrin between females and males of the resistant strain vary only marginally, genes that are over-expressed in both sexes are more likely to be involved in conferring metabolic resistance. arguably cyp6z <dig> and cyp6m <dig> showing the highest transcript levels in both sexes are good candidate genes involved in metabolic detoxification of permethrin.

the cyp <dig> class of p450s is a rapidly evolving gene family  <cit>  and there are no recognised orthologs for cyp6z <dig> and cyp6m <dig> outside of the mosquito taxa. the most similar p450s to cyp6z <dig> as retrieved by blast  <cit>  found in other insect species are cyp6d <dig> in musca domestica  and cyp6d <dig> in drosophila melanogaster . intriguingly cyp6d <dig> is over-expressed in several housefly strains resistant to permethrin  <cit>  while deletion of cyp6d <dig> in d. melanogaster did not alter the toxicity of several insecticides including pyrethroids  <cit> . p450s most similar to cyp6m <dig> identified using blast  <cit>  in a. gambiae are the cyp6n <dig> in aedes albopictus , cyp6bb <dig> in the eastern saltmarsh mosquito, ochlerotatus sollicitans, , and cyp6a <dig> in m. domestica . in d. melanogaster the protein showing the highest similarity with cyp6m <dig> is cyp6a <dig> . to our knowledge these putatively related genes have yet not been associated with pyrethroid resistance. enzymes of the cyp <dig> family are, however, generally involved in detoxification of xenobiotics in insects  <cit> . functional characterisation of these enzymes is required to demonstrate the biological role of cyp6z <dig> and cyp6m <dig> in pyrethroid resistance in a. gambiae.

along with the neurotoxic effect, pyrethroids may induce oxidative stress which increases the toxicity of the insecticide  <cit> . elevated levels of the sod3b might increase pyrethroid resistance as superoxide dismutase enzymes show antioxidant properties protecting organisms from the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . while sod3b was up-regulated in the odumasy strain superoxide dismutases were not found to be differentially expressed in the permethrin resistant rsp strain  <cit> . among the three candidate genes apparent in both sexes of the resistant strain, sod3b shows the lowest expression levels and higher variability – indicated by its higher p-value – across measurements, assigning this gene a lower rank. likewise, gsts1- <dig> – over-expressed in females of the resistant strain – although unlikely to be directly involved in pyrethroid metabolism may confer increased pyrethroid tolerance as a result of its antioxidant properties. in d. melanogaster a sigma class gst, dmgsts <dig>  is thought to have a function in protection against oxidative injury  <cit>  although it was initially subscribed a structural function in the indirect flight muscle  <cit> . females of the permethrin resistant odumasy strain also show higher transcript levels for coejhe5e which is similar to the d. melanogaster gene product drome-cg <dig>  drome-cg <dig> has been identified as a juvenile hormone esterase  <cit> . to our knowledge there is no implication that this gene is involved in pyrethroid detoxification and may rather reflect strain specific differences in the metabolism of the female reproductive system.

the comparison between females and males in each strain revealed a larger set of genes being differentially expressed than the strain comparison within each sex. this is not surprising as many traits such as reproduction, host seeking, blood feeding etc. differ between the sexes. in a. gambiae, whole genome arrays show sex-biased gene expression pattern  <cit> , and a comprehensive microarray experiment looking at the contribution of sex, genotype and age to transcriptional variance in d. melanogaster found that most of the variation is attributed to sex  <cit> . while no gene has been found to be consistently above two-fold over-expressed in females among both the susceptible and resistant strain, eight p <dig> genes were over-expressed in males over females in both strains. five p450s, cyp6s <dig>  cyp6s <dig>  cyp6z <dig>  cyp12f <dig> and cyp325a <dig>  belong to families implicated in xenobiotic detoxification. the cyp <dig> members are implicated in pyrethroid resistance, cyp6m <dig>  and cyp6z <dig>  <cit> , while expression of cyp325a <dig> and cyp12f <dig> have not been correlated with insecticide resistance. however, expression of another member of the cyp <dig> family, cyp325a <dig>  has been associated with insecticide resistance in the pyrethroid resistant rsp strain  <cit> . putatively all five p450s may play a role in xenobiotic detoxification. orthologs of the other three over-expressed p450s in males, cyp307a <dig>  cyp314a <dig>  and cyp306a <dig>  are all involved in the ecdysteroid hormone biosynthesis in d. melanogaster  <cit> . ecdysteroid hormones control a range of biological functions including molting, behaviour, the development of the nervous system, reproduction, and production of sex pheromones  <cit> . it is possible that the biosynthesis of ecdysteroid hormones such as those triggering spermatogenesis are increased in males over females during the early stages in adult anopheline mosquitoes.

field studies in western kenya revealed the presence of target site insensitivity and metabolic resistance in the same a. gambiae population where pyrethroid-treated bed nets are being widely used  <cit> . measurements of transcript levels in the permethrin resistant rsp strain originating from the same region showed elevated levels of cyp6z <dig> and gste <dig>  <cit> . in the west african odumasy strain neither of these genes is associated with permethrin resistance. in contrast gste <dig> levels are depressed in males from the resistant versus the susceptible strain. here, two alternative p450s, cyp6z <dig> and cyp6m <dig>  are highly over-expressed in females and males.

the odumasy strain also shows high frequency  of the west african type kdr allele in field populations  <cit> . this kdr allele differs from the east african type by a different mutation at the same amino acid position conferring permethrin resistance  <cit> . the present data implies that, as for target site insensitivity, metabolic resistance to the same insecticide class may be due to alternative mechanisms. in contrast to target site insensitivity – where only a few set of alternative alleles are possible as most alleles would alter the protein's overall structure – extensive gene duplication within the mosquito detoxification gene family may enable up-regulation of various enzymes that alternatively contribute to insecticide resistance. analyses of expression patterns in a series of susceptible and resistant d. melanogaster strains revealed that p450-mediated metabolic resistance evolves via the differential selection of multiple p450s through selection to the same insecticides  <cit> . similarly in house flies, scott and kasai  <cit>  found different p450s being selected against permethrin in different populations. one of the factors causing evolutionary plasticity to the same insecticide could be differential selection pressures as a function of actual insecticide dosages encountered by mosquitoes in the field. it has been suggested if selection takes repeatedly place within the normal response of an insect population such doses of insecticide will select for polygenic resistance while those outside the normal response will select for monogenic resistance  <cit> . selection pressures may be higher where insecticides are widely used in agriculture as opposed to pyrethroid-treated bed nets. while the intensity of application certainly plays an important role, temporal fluctuations in insecticide dosages may be equally important. for example, diabate et al.  <cit>  found seasonal variation of insecticide resistance in a. gambiae field populations in relation to the use of insecticides in agriculture. given the overall heterogeneity in insecticide coverage it may well be that in some circumstances selection will favour either mono- or polygenic resistance.

barriers in gene flow such as the rift valley between east and west kenyan populations or geographical distance between populations may also favour multiple origins of insecticide resistance. such barriers have been suggested to explain variation in the genetic diversity among african a. gambiae populations  <cit> . noteworthy, the east african kdr allele type reported from the permethrin resistant a. gambiae in western kenya is not found in coastal kenya  <cit> . likewise some of the differences in gene expression patterns found in this study may be attributable to geographic variation rather than the observed phenotype. nevertheless, both loci, cyp6z <dig> and cyp6m <dig>  identified in this study are mapped within a cluster of p450s on chromosome 3r previously associated with pyrethroid resistance  <cit> .

an unresolved issue is how much of the observed resistance phenotype is attributable to kdr. target site and metabolic mechanisms may act synergistically  <cit>  and the detection of both mechanisms is therefore crucial. the contribution of the two mechanisms in the odumasy strain and other populations needs further research. selection experiments on field collected mosquitoes where both kdr frequencies and gene expression levels are measured would provide the most complete evidence. additionally, studies comparing selected and parental strains from various field sites across africa are needed to shed more light on the origin and evolution of metabolic resistance in field populations of a. gambiae.

CONCLUSIONS
to date pyrethroids are the only highly effective class of commercially insecticides available to treat bednets. the present data suggest that there may be multiple metabolic resistance mechanisms found in a. gambiae populations which pose a severe challenge to the sustainability of malaria vector control programmes. new insecticides and a comprehensive screening tool for the detection and management of insecticide resistance are urgently required for use in malaria epidemic regions.
