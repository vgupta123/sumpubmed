BACKGROUND
soil salinity is one of the most significant abiotic stresses limiting plant growth, productivity, and geographical distribution  <cit> . approximately 20% of the world’s cultivated lands, and nearly 50% of irrigated lands, are affected by salinity  <cit> . high salt levels impose two stresses on plants: osmotic stress, resulting from the lowered water availability because of the high osmotic pressure in the soil; and ionic stress arising from solute imbalance, in which there are increased levels of na+ and cl- in the cytosol and changes to the intracellular k+/na+ ratio  <cit> . halophytes are the natural inhabitants of highly saline soils, and have evolved resistance strategies including efficient control of the uptake and compartmentalization of salt ions, synthesis of organic ‘compatible’ solutes, and unique morphological structures such as succulent leaves, salt glands, and bladders  <cit> . such remarkable adaptations to salty soil make halophytes excellent candidates to investigate salt-tolerance mechanisms and to identify effective salt-response genes in this type of flora  <cit> .

studies on the salt-tolerance mechanisms of halophytes have been carried out recently in several model plants, such as thellungiella halophila, mesembryanthemum crystallinum, suaeda, and populus. excellent progress has been made in understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying stress tolerance. however, knowledge about halophytes and their physiology is rather limited with respect to their wide taxonomic occurrence. it remains unclear whether halophytes have unique tolerance mechanisms, and whether such mechanisms are taxonomically linked, and/or have evolved to respond to interactions between salinity and other environmental variables. therefore, studies on several species from different salt-stressed environments should be performed to answer these questions  <cit> .

reaumuria trigyna  is an endangered dicotyledonous shrub with the features of a recretohalophyte. it is regarded as a living fossil owing to its tethys ocean origin  <cit> . this species is endemic to the eastern alxa–western ordos area , a salinized desert in inner mongolia, china. the area is characterized by its high soil salinity , hyper-drought conditions , and low temperature   <cit> . to adapt to the semi-desert and salty soil environment, r. trigyna has developed a distinct morphology that is characterized by succulent leaves and sunken stomata. these features are typical of a recretohalophyte—a halophyte with salt excretion glands. according to our previous studies, the concentrations of na+, cl-, and so42- in the soil where r. trigyna grows are higher than those of k+, mg2+, and ca2+. the na+ concentration in the soil is as high as  <dig>  mg/g, with a na+/k+ ratio of approximately  <dig>  r. trigyna excretes na+ and cl- via its multicellular salt glands, but little k+ is excreted, with a na+/k+ ratio of only  <dig> . when seedlings were treated with  <dig> mm nacl, r. trigyna showed a rapid increase in glutathione  from nearly  <dig>  to  <dig>  nmol·g- <dig> fw, and showed significant increases in the activities of superoxide dismutase  and peroxidase    <cit> . as a typical recretohalophyte growing in this area, r. trigyna could be considered as a reference species to represent those that survive in the severely adverse environment of the ordos desert. knowledge about the unique adaption strategies employed by r. trigyna will provide valuable references to the salt-tolerance mechanisms in these species and possibly in other halophytes growing in different environments. however, these objectives are difficult to achieve without detailed genetic and sequence information for this species. fortunately, powerful high throughput sequencing technologies are now available to sequence the genome of plants de novo. therefore, it is now possible to obtain the required sequences of r. trigyna to address important questions about its physiology, such as its mechanisms of salt-tolerance.

next-generation sequencing  technology has developed rapidly in recent years. it not only provides rapid, cost-effective, and comprehensive analyses of complex nucleic acid populations for model plants or species closely related to model plants, but also provides opportunities to analyze non-model plants whose genomes have never been sequenced  <cit> . this technology has been used widely in comparative transcriptomics to identify differences in transcript abundance among different cultivars, organs, and different treatment conditions  <cit> . in the present study, we generated a transcriptome dataset to provide genetic information to explore the salt-tolerance mechanisms of r. trigyna using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform. we compared transcriptomes of salt-stressed and control plants to identify genes showing transcriptional changes, and identified the functions of the transcripts and the kegg pathways that showed changes. we speculate that the assembled, annotated transcriptome sequences and transcript abundance patterns will provide a valuable genetic resource for further investigations of the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in this species, and possibly in other recretohalophytes.

RESULTS
sequencing output and assembly
two sequencing libraries were prepared from control  and nacl-treated samples  to investigate the transcriptomic responses to salt-stress in r. trigyna. in total,  <dig>  million raw reads were generated from c <dig> and  <dig>  million raw reads were generated from t <dig> . the raw reads had an average length of  <dig> bp. among all the raw reads, more than 92% had phred-like quality scores at the q <dig> level . these were used for de novo assembly. as a result,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  scaffolds, were generated. after removal of redundancy,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were clustered using the gene indices clustering tools  program . the random distribution of reads in the above-assembled unigenes indicated that the 3’ ends of all assembled unigenes contained relatively fewer reads compared with other positions within these unigenes, which showed greater and more even distributions .

mean length: mean length of assembled sequences.

n50: 50% of the assembled bases were incorporated into sequences with length of n <dig> or longer.

using the cap <dig> assembler, we obtained  <dig> all-unigenes with an average length of  <dig> bp and an n <dig> of  <dig> bp by combining c <dig>  and t <dig>  clean reads . of the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig> were clustered from the assembled c <dig>  and t <dig>  unigenes. the remaining  <dig> sequences were singletons with  <dig> from c <dig> and  <dig> from t <dig> unigenes. the length distributions of the unigenes from both c <dig> and t <dig> were similar with sequences in the 200– <dig> bp range making up  <dig> % and  <dig> % of c <dig> and t <dig> unigenes, respectively. the length of all-unigenes was dramatically increased following further assembly of the c <dig> and t <dig> unigenes, resulting in assembled sequences with lengths of >  <dig> bp . ultimately,  <dig> gap-free sequences were obtained by assembling all of the c21- and t43-unigenes.

functional annotation of assembled unigenes
all assembled high-quality unigenes were first blasted against the ncbi non-redundant  database using blastx with a cut-off e-value of 10- <dig>  of the  <dig> all-unigenes,  <dig>  returned at least one match at the e-value > 10- <dig>  because of the lack of genome and est information for r. trigyna or closely related taxa,  <dig> % of the unigenes did not match to known genes in the database. based on sequence homology,  <dig> unigenes were categorized into  <dig> gene ontology  terms . in each of the three main go classifications, i.e., biological process, cellular component, and molecular function, “cellular process”, “metabolic process”, “cell”, “cell part” and “binding” terms were dominant among the returned terms. many of the identified unigenes were classified in the categories “response to stimulus”, “organelle” and “catalytic activity”, whereas only a few genes belonged to “biological adhesion”, “cell killing”, “locomotion”, “viral reproduction”, “virion” and “virion part”. interestingly,  <dig> unigenes were classified into the category “transporter activity” and  <dig> unigenes into the category “antioxidant activity”.

to further evaluate the integrity of our transcriptome library and the effectiveness of our annotation process, unigene sequences were subjected to clusters of orthologous groups  classification. out of  <dig> nr hits,  <dig> sequences showed a cog classification . among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for “general function prediction only”  was the largest group, followed by “replication, recombination and repair” , “transcription” , “signal transduction mechanisms” , and “carbohydrate transport and metabolism” . the categories “nuclear structure”  and “extracellular structures”  had the fewest corresponding genes.

the  <dig> annotated sequences were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes . among those,  <dig> unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the pathways most strongly represented by mapped unigenes were “metabolic pathways” , “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” , and “plant-pathogen interaction” , indicating that these were the active pathways in r. trigyna. finally,  <dig> unigenes were annotated in the transcriptome of r. trigyna, of which  <dig> were generated by blast analysis and  <dig> were annotated using the estscan program.

identification and annotation of potential differentially expressed genes 
the analysis showed that  <dig> unigenes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated upon treatment of r. trigyna seedlings with salt solution. in total,  <dig> degs were identified in both libraries, including  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes . among those degs responding to salt-stress treatment,  <dig> were annotated and  <dig> had no blast hits.

enrichment analysis was conducted to clarify the biological functions of the identified degs. the results indicated that  <dig> degs were enriched in  <dig> go terms, using a corrected p-value ≤  <dig>  as the threshold . among these go categories, “oxidoreductase activity” , “catalytic activity”  and “response to stress”  were significantly enriched among degs compared with the whole transcriptome background. in total,  <dig> degs were enriched in  <dig> metabolic pathways  . the most enriched metabolic pathways were “metabolic pathways” , “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” , and “plant-pathogen interaction” . the pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis were very active, while those associated with ascorbate, aldarate, and nitrogen metabolism were strongly suppressed in salt-treated plants .

genes related to ion transport
among the unigenes, we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes related to regulation of k+ uptake, h+ pumping, and na+ efflux, respectively . clearly, genes associated with k+-transport formed the largest proportions of screened genes, suggesting that these genes played important role in reestablishing na+/k+ homeostasis in salt-stressed r. trigyna. among  <dig> k+ transport genes,  <dig> were degs, including  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes in response to salt-stress. kup  and cngc  transcripts were present at high levels in both libraries, but were down-regulated by nearly 2-fold under salt-stress. seven hkt <dig> genes, which are responsible for na+ influx, were salt-responsive, of which three  were suppressed by more than 2-fold. we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes encoding plasma membrane h+-atpases , vacuolar h+-atpases  and h+-pyrophosphatases , respectively. out of  <dig> v-atpase homologs, four showed down-regulated transcription under salt treatment while the other  <dig> did not. transcripts of six pm-h+-atpase homologs were highly abundant in both libraries. two pm-h+-atpases  were up-regulated by salt, showing increases in their reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads  values from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively. five ppases showed high transcript levels in both libraries, but their transcriptions did not change under salt-stress. among  <dig> na+ efflux genes, one pm-na+/h+ antiporter gene  showed moderate transcript levels and two showed low transcript abundance. transcription of unigene <dig> was slightly up-regulated by salt-stress . among  <dig> genes encoding v-na+/h+ antiporter family proteins, four  were highly abundant. the transcript levels of unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> were up-regulated by nearly 2-fold, whereas those of unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> were unchanged under salt-stress. there were abundant nha  transcripts in both libraries .

genes related to the ros scavenging system
in total,  <dig> unigenes were predicted to encode enzymes related to reactive oxygen species  scavenging . there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unigenes categorized into the gsh-ascorbate cycle, the peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin  pathway, the glutathione peroxidase  pathway, and the catalase  pathway, respectively. the largest group was genes encoding thioredoxins , glutathione s-transferases , glutaredoxins , and pods . we detected  <dig> genes encoding sods; three were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated by salt treatment. in the gsh-ascorbate ros removal pathway, seven ascorbate peroxidase  genes , two glr genes , one monodehydroascorbate reductase gene , one dehydroascorbate reductase gene , and two glutathione reductase genes  showed relatively abundant transcript levels . we identified five prxrs, which play a role in the prxr/trx pathway in the antioxidant defense system. two prxr genes  showed high transcript levels in both control and salt-treated plants . out of  <dig> trxs, five transcripts  were expressed at high levels in both libraries. in the gpx pathway, there were  <dig> unigenes encoding gpxs but  <dig> unigenes encoding gsts. ten gst showed increased transcription under salt-stress, with rpkm values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the t <dig> library but from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the c <dig> library. in addition,  <dig> genes belonging to the tau family of gsts showed increased transcription under salt stress.

*deg was filtered by using threshold of false discovery rate  ≤  <dig>  and absolute value of log2ratio ≥  <dig>  ug represents unigene. rpkm means rpkm values of unigenes in c <dig> or t <dig>  “fold change” equals to log <dig> . “+” indicates up-regulated transcription and “-” represents down-regulated transcription. homologous species is that identified from blast search of nr database using cut-off e-value of ≤ 10- <dig> 

experimental validation
pcr amplification showed that all qpcr primers produced only single fragments of the expected lengths . the qpcr results for  <dig> selected unigenes showed general agreement with their transcript abundance changes determined by rna-seq, suggesting the reliability of the transcriptomic profiling data. however, moderate discrepancies between the expression levels and rpkm values were observed in ten unigenes, i.e., unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  unigene <dig>  unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> . on the other hand, amplifications of longer sequences  had a lower success rate. among the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig> unigenes yielded fragments >  <dig> bp and the other four failed to produce amplification products, yielding a success rate of  <dig> %. all positive clones from the validation studies were sequenced by sanger sequencing, and the results completely confirmed the illumina results.

discussion
construction of an informative transcriptome dataset for r. trigyna
for many non-model species, there is no background genomic information available for researchers to conduct comprehensive investigations into the genetic mechanisms underlying their unique features. therefore, the newly developed ngs technique has been used widely to explore genomic solutions to important physiological questions. gene annotation is an important element of ngs in which biological information is attached to the predicted genes or unigenes. a high proportion of unigenes with high-confidence blastx similarity to protein sequences from annotated gene catalogs of other plant species is considered to indicate the integrity of transcript sequences assembled from illumina short-read data  <cit> . this assumption was also verified by the results generated in the present study. in r. trigyna,  <dig> % of  <dig> unigenes were annotated by blast analysis and functional bioinformatics analyses . overall, the top five species with blast hits to annotated unigenes were arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, arabidopsis lyrata, populus trichocarpa, and vitis vinifera, species for which the annotations of their genomes are comprehensive and largely accepted. this suggested that the sequences of the r. trigyna unigenes generated in the present study were assembled and annotated correctly.

the lengths of the assembled sequences are crucial in determining the level of significance of a blast match  <cit> . out of all the assembled unigenes,  <dig> % had lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, among which  <dig> % had significant blast hits in the public databases. there were  <dig> unigenes showing strong homology with the sequences hit in the database . among  <dig> unigenes with sequence lengths >  <dig> bp,  <dig> % had significant blast scores and  <dig> % showed e-values less than  <dig> e- <dig>  out of all the unannotated unigenes ,  <dig> % were longer than  <dig> bp, demonstrating that the lack of annotation for these unigenes was not because of a shorter sequence length but because of a genuine lack of hits to sequences in the database. therefore, we can speculate that these unannotated unigenes represent a specific genetic resource of r. trigyna, which warrants further investigation.

in this study, we also used other strategies to enhance the effectiveness of the short reads assembly, apart from the use of bioinformatics methods. these included preparation of high-quality rna samples, removal of dirty raw reads, blast assembly of unigenes using multiple databases, and the large sample population for sequencing  <cit> . first, rna was isolated from sterile r. trigyna seedlings to minimize the risk of contamination by foreign rnase. second, three seedlings were used to extract rna samples, not only to reduce sample bias, but also to ensure comprehensive coverage of the r. trigyna transcriptome. last, two sequencing libraries  were merged to generate longer sequences and to increase the sequencing depth. these strategies were an effective way to improve the quality of assembly and annotation of assembled unigenes  <cit> .

in summary, an extensive and diverse expressed gene catalog, representing a large proportion of the transcribed genes in r. trigyna, was successfully sampled in the present study. the gene catalog provided a comprehensive understanding of the gene transcription profiles of r. trigyna, and laid a solid foundation for further study of salt-tolerance mechanisms and identification of novel genes in this species.

transcriptome comparison identified genes related to salt-stress in r. trigyna
gene transcription and/or expression is often compared among different developmental stages, among different plant organs, or among plants under different growth conditions  <cit> . in this study, many genes showing transcriptional changes under salt stress were identified by comparing nacl-treated seedlings with untreated controls. there were  <dig> unigenes showing differences in transcript abundance, and  <dig> were defined as degs using the thresholds of false discovery rate  ≤  <dig>  and |log2ratio| ≥  <dig>  go clustering analysis suggested the potential biological functions of these degs. for example, many degs were enriched in go terms such as “oxidoreductase activity”, “catalytic activity” and “response to stress”. this information will be useful to elucidate salt-tolerance mechanisms and to find new salt-stress-related genes specific to r. trigyna. kegg enrichment analysis identified significantly enriched metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways involving degs. surprisingly, genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were transcribed at much high levels under salt stress than in the control in r. trigyna, which was not expected from the results of previous studies. this result suggested that genes in these two pathways may play vital roles in resisting oxidation and maintaining membrane integrity.

an outstanding advantage of ngs is the detection of transcripts present in low copy numbers. among the  <dig> identified degs, almost half were detected as low-abundance transcripts that were up-regulated after exposure to salt-stress. for example, only  <dig> reads from c <dig> could be mapped to unigene <dig>  encoding flavanone 3-hydroxylase , compared with  <dig> reads from t <dig>  nearly 30-fold up-regulation suggested that this gene may act as a key element in the salt-stress response. overall, transcriptome comparison analysis provided sufficient information to study the salt-responsive mechanisms and genes related to salt-tolerance related in r. trigyna.

ion transport genes are important for salt tolerance in r. trigyna
ion transport is a crucial element in response to salt stress in plants. this is particularly true in halophytes  <cit> . it has been shown that halophytes are able to grow under extreme salinity conditions because of their anatomical and morphological adaptations and/or their avoidance mechanisms  <cit> . r. trigyna is a representative recretohalophyte with unique morphological characteristics, such as salt glands and succulent leaves, allowing it to adapt to the salinized conditions of the ordos desert. our previous study showed that the salt glands of this species functionally excrete salt ions under normal and salt-stressed conditions. however, the amount of na+ and cl- excreted significantly increased under salt treatment. in addition, r. trigyna shows a strong ability to uptake k+ from barren soil. therefore, it is possible that the ion transport mechanisms and their gene expression patterns in this plant differ from those of other plant species to some extent.

once na+ is taken up into the cell, atpases  are induced to create the driving force for na+ transport. this results in not only extrusion of na+ into the external environment by na+/h+ antiporters in the plasma membrane, but also in compartmentalization into vacuoles by tonoplast na+/h+ antiporters, which are essential for reestablishing cellular ion homeostasis in salt-stressed plants  <cit> . in this study, five v-h+-ppases were detected in r. trigyna, and were proposed to generate a proton electrochemical gradient. taking the morphological characteristics of this plant into account, the largest share of the driving force generated by such enzymes is likely to be consumed by the succulent leaves and the salt glands, which include two mesophyll-like collecting cells with obvious vacuoles, and six secretory cells  <cit> . all mesophyll cells in leaves need v-h+-atpases and v-h+-ppases to generate an electrochemical gradient to compartmentalize excess na+ ions into the tonoplast, as a mechanism to cope with physiological drought conditions and ion toxicity  <cit> . when na+ is excreted via secretory cells, both v-h+-atpases and v-h+-ppases are required to produce an h+ electrochemical gradient to pump na+ into collecting cells. pm-h+-atpases generate sufficient driving force to exchange na+ ions out of the cells. in addition, higher h+-pumping activity may be indispensable to maintain the high concentration of k+ in salt-stressed r. trigyna. the activation of pm-h+-atpases in salinized populus euphratica led to repolarization or hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and thus decreased nacl-induced k+ loss through depolarization-activated outward rectifying k+ channels   <cit> . in r. trigyna,  <dig> out of  <dig> rtkocs showed high homology with those of populus, demonstrating similar functions of these genes. the analysis of transcripts related to k+ uptake showed that the outstanding potassium uptake capacity of r. trigyna was probably conferred by enhanced kup/hak  and akt k+ uptake systems, among which the number of up-regulated unigenes  far exceeded that of down-regulated unigenes  under salt stress. in summary, proton electrochemical gradient-dependent k+ maintenance, ions secretion, compartmentalization, and enhanced k+ uptake systems may represent important components in reestablishing ion homeostasis in r. trigyna.

on the other hand, we detected  <dig> nhxs that were probably responsible for na+ sequestration. the significantly up-regulated unigene <dig> and  <dig> showed high homology to the citrus reticulata nhx <dig> and a salsola komarovii na+/h+ antiporter, respectively. the slightly down-regulated unigene <dig> and  <dig> had a highly significant blast hit to the na+/h+ antiporter of m. crystallinum and the nhx <dig> of tetragonia tetragonioides, respectively. these four unigenes also showed strong homology to the nhx <dig> of a. thaliana, suggesting that these atnhx2-like proteins play an important role in avoiding or mitigating the deleterious effects of high na+ levels in the cytosol or in regulating intravacuolar k+ and ph, which has been demonstrated in arabidopsis <cit> . our prediction is also supported to some degree by the studies of succulent leaves of the halophytes suaeda salsa and halostachys caspica <cit> .

in r. trigyna, we identified only one moderately expressed and up-regulated pm na+/h+ antiporter , named rtsos <dig>  the transcript profile of this gene was consistent with those of thsos <dig> and pesos <dig>  which remained relatively constant or were slightly up-regulated under salt-tress  <cit> . escherichia coli complementation experiments with penhad <dig> rescued salt-exposed bacteria by lowering salt accumulation  <cit> , suggesting that the p. euphratica gene penhad <dig> also functions as an na+⁄h+ antiporter. interestingly, a highly abundant transcript  encoding an nha protein was identified in our dataset. this may play a role in na+ exclusion in r. trigyna. at present, it is still unknown how the moderately up-regulated rtsos <dig> achieves effective efflux of excess salt ions under extreme salt-stress, and whether any other gene products are also involved in this process. this requires further investigations in the near future.

ros scavenging plays a key role in salt-stress response in r. trigyna
salt stress causes a rapid increase in ros, including superoxide radicals , hydrogen peroxide , and hydroxyl radicals , which perturb cellular redox homeostasis and result in oxidative damage to many cellular components and structures  <cit> . according to our previous studies, ·o2- increased rapidly in r. trigyna seedlings treated with  <dig> mm nacl, as did the concentrations of other antioxidants, for example, gsh. at the same time, increased activities of antioxidant enzymes  were also detected. this suggested that r. trigyna probably has a similar ros scavenging system to that of other plant species, and that this system can be enhanced to increase its antioxidative ability. as the first line of defense against oxidative damage, sods are usually induced by salinity to rapidly dismutate ·o2- into oxygen and h2o <dig>  which is subsequently removed through various pathways  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> sods were identified. two of them  were transcribed at high levels, and showed up-regulated transcription under salt stress. therefore, they were probably associated with enhanced sod activity and responsible for converting the increased ·o2- into h2o <dig>  on the other hand, increased gsh could be consumed in the ascorbate-gsh cycle and the gpx cycle  <cit> . in the ascorbate-gsh cycle, the oxidized ascorbate  can be converted into dehydroascorbate ; dha is then reduced to ascorbate at the expense of gsh, yielding oxidized gsh . in the gpx pathway, gpx can reduce h2o <dig> to the corresponding hydroxyl compounds using gsh. however, to fulfill its function as an antioxidant, gsh must be catalyzed by gsts, which have gpx activity and can use gsh to reduce organic hydroperoxides of fatty acids and nucleic acids to the corresponding monohydroxy alcohols  <cit> . interestingly, in our dataset, there were  <dig> salt-induced gsts genes that likely participated in such catalytic processes, especially the  <dig> tau family gsts  <cit> . this finding was similar to the results of other studies on salt-stressed plants  <cit> . therefore, the interaction between gsh and gst may be an important factor in the ros scavenging system of r. trigyna. in addition, we identified  <dig> genes encoding components of the prxr/trx defense system, which employs a thiol-based catalytic mechanism to reduce h2o <dig> and is regenerated using trxs as electron donors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes a platform in which publicly available information was matched to the r. trigyna transcriptome using ngs technology. the substantially assembled sequences represented a considerable portion of the transcriptome of this plant. transcriptome comparison identified the transcripts and metabolic pathways that play significant roles in the response to salt stress. these results will prompt studies on the molecular mechanisms of salt resistance, facilitate the analysis of expression profiles of genes related to salt tolerance, and accelerate the discovery of specific stress-resistance genes in r. trigyna. the information provided here can also further extend the knowledge on the salt tolerance of halophytes that survive in high sodic stress in areas such as the semi-desert saline areas in ordos, inner mongolia, china.
