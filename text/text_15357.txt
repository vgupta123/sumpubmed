BACKGROUND
bacteria-mediated tumor therapy has been investigated for over a century  <cit> . the ability of bacteria to colonize malignant tissue has been exploited in different therapeutic approaches  <cit> .

the delivery of therapeutic agents by bacteria to the tumor represents a promising approach to eradicate the tumor from the inside  <cit> . a major prerequisite is the specific bacterial colonization of tumor tissue without simultaneous colonization of healthy tissue.

obligate anaerobic bacteria like clostridia or bifidobacteria colonize solely the anoxic parts of tumors due to their inability to tolerate oxygen  <cit> . for facultative anaerobic bacteria like salmonella, escherichia, vibrio or listeria, specific tumor colonization has been described and different therapeutic approaches were investigated  <cit> . in general, virulence-attenuated gram-positive bacterial pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes, may be better suited for the systemic application of bacteria in tumor therapy as these bacteria lack the lps of gram-negative bacteria. lps may induce strong immune reactions culminating in septic shock after release into the blood stream.

listeria monocytogenes  has been successfully studied as carrier for the delivery of dna and rna into mammalian cells  <cit> . in this case pathogenicity of the listerial carrier strain was attenuated by the deletion of aroa  <cit> . in contrast to most other applied virulence-attenuated lm strains  <cit> , the aroa mutant possesses all virulence factors, thus enabling the carrier bacteria to invade mammalian cells, escape from the phagosome, and replicate in the cytosol of infected host cells. the intracellular replication rate of the aroa mutant was, however, lower compared to the according wild-type strain and the capability of cell-to-cell spread was drastically reduced  <cit> .

the cytosolic life cycle of lm poses an advantage for the delivery of nucleic acids harboring eukaryotic expression cassettes compared to other intracellular bacteria like salmonella, which reside and replicate in phagosomal compartments. the utilization of lm as a carrier for the direct delivery of prodrug-converting-enzymes and for the introduction of dna encoding these enzymes into tumor cells in vitro was successfully assessed recently  <cit> . internalization of lm into non-phagocytic mammalian cells is mainly triggered by the two internalins a and b encoded by the inlab operon . the deletion of inlab thus strongly reduces the ability of lm to actively invade such host cells, but does not change their passive uptake by phagocytic cells.

the targeting of carrier microorganisms to cell surface proteins of specific cells was first performed in viral gene therapy  <cit> . by genetic fusion of staphylococcus aureus protein a  to viral coat proteins monoclonal antibodies recognizing specific receptors on the target cells were fixed to the viral surface. due to the thereby achieved specific virus/cell interaction, uptake of the viral carrier by the selected target cells could be obtained. alternatively, single chain antibody fragments  were expressed on the viral surface which - by the interaction with specific receptors on the host cell surface - led to preferential viral infection of the specific target cells as well.

many tumor cells overexpress specific marker proteins on their surface which include oncoproteins. her <dig>  and her <dig> , members of the egfr/her family, represent such prominent surface proteins  <cit> . enhanced expression or mutational activation of these cell surface proteins leads to tumor progression and generally correlates with poor prognosis in tumor therapy . both tumor markers, her <dig> and her <dig>  are specifically recognized by the chimeric/humanized monoclonal antibodies, erbitux  and herceptin  which are approved for therapy of colorectal carcinoma and breast cancer, respectively.

antibody-mediated targeting of bacteria to tumor cells was described so far only for salmonella enterica serovar thyphimurium expressing a scfv against carcino-embryonic-antigen cea. antibody expression resulted in a 2-fold increase of these bacteria in the tumor tissue  <cit> .

as a novel approach we describe in this study the construction of a virulence-attenuated lm strain with deletions in inlab and aroa which expresses functional spa anchored to the cell wall. this strain, when coated with herceptin or erbitux, triggered a highly efficient, inlab-independent internalization into tumor cell lines over-expressing her <dig> and her <dig>  respectively, but not into cell lines lacking these receptors. in a xenograft murine tumor model we could also observe a significant increase in tumor colonization of this lm strain after intravenous injection when the respective antibody was covalently crosslinked to the surface-exposed spa.

RESULTS
expression of recombinant spa by internalin a and b deficient l. monocytogenes and its correct orientation on the listerial cell surface
a s.au reus protein a -expressing lm strain was constructed by replacing the non-essential phage integrase/recombinase gene int in the genome of the listerial mutant Δtrps,aroa,inla/b × pflo-trps by the spa gene . spa is controlled by the listeriolysin  promoter . the phly carrying dna fragment contained the signal sequence of hly which was fused in frame to the spa gene. the spa gene sequence encodes all five fc binding domains and the lpxtg motif for sortase-dependent anchoring of the spa protein to peptidoglycan  <cit> . the expressed spa protein thus contains all regions necessary for efficient translocation across the bacterial cell membrane and for anchoring spa to the cell wall of lm. this lm strain  is named lm-spa+ in the following.

expression of spa by the constructed lm strains was analyzed by western blotting using polyclonal protein a antibody. bacterial cell surface and cytoplasmic protein fractions were examined after growth of lm-spa+ in bhi containing 1% amberlite xad- <dig>  addition of xad- <dig> to the culture medium enhances the activity of the virulence gene activator prfa and hence leads to an enhanced transcription of the spa gene which is under the control of the prfa-dependent hly promoter  <cit> . spa was readily detected in the cell surface protein fraction of lm-spa+ and to a lower extent in the internal protein extract fraction. . as expected, no spa was present in the parental strain Δtrps,aroa,inla/b × pflo-trps, termed lm-spa- .

fc-mediated binding of antibodies to spa on the surface of l. monocytogenes
the functionality of fc-mediated binding of antibodies to spa on the surface of lm-spa+ was first tested by immunofluorescence microscopy of lm-spa- and lm-spa+ after incubation of the bacteria with polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against ovalbumin . after addition of fitc-conjugated ova no fluorescence was detected with lm-spa-, while the lm-spa+ strain showed a strong fluorescence .

a more quantitative analysis of spa expression was performed by flow cytometry after staining lm-spa+ and lm-spa- with fitc-conjugated rabbit-anti-goat-antibodies. lm-spa- bacteria showed no staining while the lm-spa+ bacteria were stained almost completely .

in addition, the number of spa molecules per bacterial cell was determined indirectly. for this goal lm-spa+ was incubated simultaneously with a primary antibody against native albumin as model protein in the presence of an excess of albumin. the bacteria bound the albumin-loaded antibody to their surface via spa and later on the amount of bound protein was quantified. therefore the samples were denatured in laemmli buffer and size separated by sds-page. subsequently the amount of bound albumin was determined by western blot analysis using a primary antibody recognizing denatured albumin. untreated lm-spa+ did not bind albumin, while lm-spa+ coated with the albumin-specific antibody bound albumin .

computer aided comparison of the band intensity of bacterially bound albumin with the known protein amount of the positive control revealed a  <dig> times higher signal intensity. thus  <dig> ng albumin were bound to  <dig> ×  <dig> bacterial cells. with albumin having a protein mass of  <dig> kda  <dig> ng correspond to  <dig> * <dig> molecules. divided by the number of bacteria employed for the coating  approximately  <dig> albumin molecules were bound per bacterial cell. assuming two bound albumin molecules per antibody and one antibody per spa molecule, this means that at least  <dig> spa molecules are exposed in the correct orientation on the surface of each lm-spa+ cell.

internalization of antibody coated lm-spa+ into cancer cell lines expressing the respective antibody ligand
after the successful demonstration of spa binding to the bacterial surface, it was important to investigate whether the binding of tumor receptor-specific antibodies to spa on the surface of lm-spa+ can mediate specific cell recognition and internalization of the bacteria into the tumor cells. the mouse mammary gland cell line 4t <dig>  and the isogenic cell line 4t1-her <dig>  were used in these experiments as well as the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and trastuzumab directed against her <dig> and her <dig>  respectively. both mabs belong to the same igg <dig> subclass of immunoglobulins, but cetuximab is a mouse/human chimeric antibody whereas trastuzumab is almost completely humanized. cetuximab is therefore a control for unspecific antibody coating of lm-spa+ when analyzing the interaction of these bacteria with murine 4t1-her <dig> cells.

the lm egde wild-type strain was able to efficiently enter both cell lines 4t <dig> and 4t1-her <dig> . as expected, the lm-spa- strain  was not internalized by 4t <dig> or 4t1-her <dig> cells regardless of whether these bacteria were incubated with cetuximab or trastuzumab . lm-spa+ was also unable to enter 4t <dig> and 4t1-her <dig> cells without antibody coating or with cetuximab coating. however, high internalization of lm-spa+ into 4t1-her <dig> cells was observed when these bacteria were coated with trastuzumab .

lm-spa- was also not internalized by the human sk-br- <dig> and sk-ov- <dig> cancer cells  in the presence or absence of the two mabs . in contrast lm-spa+ coated with either cetuximab or trastuzumab, but not the uncoated lm-spa+, was able to enter these cells efficiently .

as shown in figure 2a and 2b the coating of lm-spa+ with the receptor-specific antibody led to a highly significant increase of lm-spa+ internalization  into tumor cells expressing the respective receptor on the surface. antibody mediated internalization was followed by bacterial escape into the host cell cytosol and replication as examined by immunofluorescence .

herceptin-mediated internalization of protein a coated beads into the 4t1-her <dig> cell line
trastuzumab coated beads of  <dig>  μm diameter were used to assess whether this antibody alone is able to induce internalization of large particles into a cell line expressing the her <dig> receptor. alexa fluor  <dig> labeled trastuzumab  was efficiently bound by dynabeads protein a , while the goat α-human cy <dig> antibody could not be bound directly . if the beads were preincubated with trastuzumab or cetuximab, α-human cy <dig> antibody efficiently bound to this antibody, indirectly labeling this beads . beads depicted in green were labeled with trastuzumab-alexa <dig>  while red ones bound α-human cy <dig> antibody.

beads were coated with trastuzumab-alexa <dig> and incubated with 4t1-her <dig> cells. following this incubation cy <dig> labeled α-human antibody was added into the supernatant, resulting in a double staining of extracellular beads. beads without antibody treatment prior to incubation with eukaryotic cells were found to remain completely extracellular . in contrast some of the beads treated with trastuzumab or trastuzumab-alexa <dig> were located intracellular . only pretreatment with trastuzumab and its labeled derivate allowed internalization of beads into this cell line, cetuximab did not trigger internalization . thus, trastuzumab is sufficient to mediate internalization of beads, larger than bacteria, into the 4t1-her <dig> cell line.

serum strongly reduces the internalization of antibody-coated lm-spa+
for the evaluation of antibody-mediated targeting in vivo lm-spa+ was coated with trastuzumab and  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria were injected i.v. into balb/c scid mice bearing 4t1-her <dig> tumors. in a control group equal numbers of uncoated lm-spa+ were used. in contrast to the in vitro data where lm-spa+ coated with trastuzumab showed highly significant internalization into 4t1-her <dig> cells compared to uncoated lm-spa+ , no significant difference of the bacterial counts in liver, spleen or tumor was observed when the mice were treated with antibody-coated or -uncoated lm-spa+ . to rule out the possibility that during the blood passage the non-covalently bound mabs on the surface of the coated lm-spa+ bacteria might be displaced by the igg antibodies of the blood serum fresh murine serum was added to trastuzumab-coated lm-spa+ bacteria prior to in vitro infection of 4t1-her <dig> cells. this treatment completely abolished the specific internalization and the coated lm-spa+ behaved like uncoated lm-spa+ bacteria .

to prevent the displacement of the spa-bound antibody by serum antibodies we covalently linked trastuzumab to spa on the bacterial surface with dimethyl pimelinediimidate dihydrochloride , a homobifunctional imidoester cross-linker. the concentration of dmp and the incubation conditions were evaluated to achieve optimal crosslinking and bacterial viability . treatment of lm-spa+ with dmp under these conditions did not alter the internalization efficiency significantly, but largely prevented the negative effect of murine serum on the internalization of trastuzumab-coated lm-spa+ into 4t1-her <dig> cells in vitro .

targeting of lm-spa+ coated with covalently bound antibody to 4t1-her <dig> tumors in mice
the above described in vitro data showing that the antibody can be covalently linked to spa on the surface of lm-spa+ without losing the bacterial viability encouraged us to modified antibody-targeted bacteria in the mouse tumor model system. briefly, balb/c scid mice carrying 4t1-her <dig> tumors were injected i.v. with  <dig> ×  <dig> lm-spa+ bacteria coated with trastuzumab crosslinked to spa. similarly treated cetuximab-coated lm-spa+ bacteria were included in this in vivo experiment as a negative control. one day after infection the bacterial counts were determined in liver, spleen and tumor. for the distinction of intra- and extracellularly replicating bacteria, the tumor tissue was enzymatically digested to obtain a single cell-suspension, part of which was treated with gentamicin to kill the extracellular bacteria while the other part remained untreated to allow the determination of the total bacterial counts in the tumor. both fractions were plated in serial dilutions to obtain viable bacterial counts . as shown in figure  <dig> injection of tumor bearing mice with lm-spa+ coated with covalently bound trastuzumab resulted in significantly increased cfu per cell of tumor tissue compared to lm-spa+ with covalently bound cetuximab and uncoated lm-spa+ . this difference was observed in the gentamicin treated as well as in the untreated fractions but the increase is more pronounced in the untreated fractions. the coating with trastuzumab increased the amount of bacteria 8- to 10-fold, while the amount of intracellular bacteria was elevated only 3- to 4-fold . in liver and spleen a 2-fold increase of bacteria was observed with the trastuzumab-coated but not with the cetuximab-coated lm-spa+.

discussion
in this study we describe a novel approach for cell targeting which uses an inla- and inlb- deficient lm mutant expressing spa anchored to the cell wall. antibodies bind to these bacteria via their fc part thereby enabling interaction of the bacteria with receptors  exposed on the surface of target cells recognized by the antibodies. in spite of a relatively low coverage of the bacterial surface with spa-bound antibodies, a highly efficient targeting of the bacteria to the antibody-recognized tumor cell receptors  is observed. two clinically approved humanized and chimeric monoclonal antibodies, trastuzumab and cetuximab, respectively, directed against the cell surface receptors her2/neu and egfr/her <dig> respectively, were applied in this study. these receptors are overexpressed in several types of cancer, thus representing excellent specific targets for lm coated with trastuzumab or cetuximab  <cit> . antibody coated lm strains not only showed specific binding to tumor cell lines but also a highly efficient internalization into tumor cell lines. this internalization was clearly independent of the known inla and/or inlb-mediated invasion machinery of lm, as these two major invasion factors  were deleted in the antibody-coated lm strains. experiments showing internalization of trastuzumab-coated beads into her <dig> expressing cells indicate that the internalization may be completely independent of listerial virulence factors. the bacteria may be taken up by the host cell passively, as a consequence of receptor recycling. the cellular recycling rate of the egf-family receptors has been shown to increase upon ligand interaction and antibody-mediated dimerization  <cit> . after trastuzumab- mediated internalization lm was able to escape into the cytosol, replicate and spread to adjacent cells as demonstrated by immunofluorescence. the efficiency of these intracellular steps was comparable to that of the corresponding Δaroa attenuated wild-type strain.

transfer of antibody-mediated targeting into xenograft mouse tumors was initially unsuccessful. subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that the incubation of the antibody coated bacteria with murine serum completely abrogated the specific internalization, but this effect was largely prevented by crosslinking of the antibody to spa on the surface of live bacteria.

crosslinking enabled also the targeting of the antibody-coated bacteria to a 4t1-her <dig> xenograft mouse tumor. the number of trastuzumab-coated bacteria in the tumor tissue increased  <dig> to 10-fold when compared to uncoated bacteria. although less than 5% of these bacteria were intracellular, the bacterial count was significantly increased relative to bacteria not coated with trastuzumab. this 3-fold increase in the number of intracellular bacteria was antibody specific, since bacteria coated with a second antibody , that recognizes the related receptor egfr, did not show a significant increase compared to uncoated bacteria.

the bacterial counts in liver and spleen were 2-fold increased with the trastuzumab-coated lm compared to the uncoated bacteria, while the cetuximab-coated bacteria colonized liver and spleen with a similar efficiency as the uncoated ones. the humanized trastuzumab contains a larger portion of non-mouse peptide sequences than the human/mouse chimeric cetuximab. thus a stronger immune reaction against trastuzumab might lead to an enhanced uptake of bacteria coated with trastuzumab by phagocytic cells in liver and spleen.

recently bereta and coworkers  <cit>  described an alternative approach of antibody-mediated targeting of bacteria whereby a single chain antibody  was expressed by salmonella vnp <dig>  in this study the scfv directed against cea caused only a low increase  of the targeted bacteria in a cea overexpressing tumor seven days post infection. our approach, which crosslinks the antibody to the surface-exposed spa, shows not only a better uptake of the targeted bacteria by the tumor , but is also more versatile, since it requires only a specific antibody against a cell surface-exposed ligand to specifically target the bacteria to the ligand-producing cells. whether these bacteria will be subsequently internalized by the target cells will presumably depend on the cell receptor recognized by the antibody.

CONCLUSIONS
certainly, further studies are needed to test this promising cell targeting technology for possible therapeutic applications  but the experiments shown here successfully demonstrate the proof of principle of the approach.
