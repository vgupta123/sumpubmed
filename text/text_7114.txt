BACKGROUND
spore-forming bacilli are aerobic, gram positive organisms sharing a common attribute of being able to differentiate into an endospore , a quiescent cell form characterized by several protective layers surrounding a dehydrated cytoplasm  <cit> . this structural organization makes the spores extremely resistant to external physical and chemical insults and able to survive almost indefinitely in the absence of water and nutrients  <cit> .

the soil is generally indicated as the main habitat of aerobic spore-formers, however, spores have been found in diverse environments including rocks, dust, aquatic environments, and the gut of various insects and animals  <cit> . recent reports have highlighted the fact that large numbers of aerobic spore-formers can be isolated from fecal and intestinal samples of healthy animals  <cit> , including humans  <cit> . hong and colleagues  <cit>  have reported that an average of  <dig> colony forming units  of aerobic spore-formers are isolated from human feces collected in different countries and from people with different dietary habits. these observations, together with a series of reports indicating that b. subtilis, the model system for spore-formers, can conduct its entire life cycle in the animal gut  <cit> , have suggested the hypothesis that the gut is the real habitat of spore-formers  <cit> . these spore-forming bacteria would enter the mammalian gi-tract in the spore form, safely transit across the stomach, germinate and grow in the upper part of the small intestine, sporulate in the lower part of the intestine and finally be excreted in the spore form  <cit> .

it has long been known that some aerobic bacilli are pigmented and examples include strains of b. megaterium  <cit> , b. atrophaeus  <cit> , b. indicus  <cit> , b. cibi  <cit> , b. vedderi  <cit> , b. jeotgali  <cit> , b. okuhidensis  <cit> , b. clarkii  <cit> , b. pseudofirmus  <cit>  and b. firmus  <cit> . more recently, a large number of pigmented bacilli have been isolated and their pigments identified as carotenoids  <cit> . those carotenoids, found associated with either vegetative cells or spores  <cit> , are thought to provide resistance to uv irradiation and reactive oxygen species. for their strong antioxidant activity carotenoids of plant, microbial or synthetic origin have several potential applications in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries. for example, carotenoids have been proposed to prevent the onset of chronic diseases  <cit>  and reduce cancer-risk  <cit>  in humans and, also for this reason, are widely marketed as dietary supplements. non-pathogenic bacteria, able to colonize the human gut and able to produce carotenoids are, therefore, particularly desirable as food supplements and/or functional food ingredients.

two pigmented bacilli, b. firmus gb <dig> and b. indicus hu <dig>  producing pink and yellow/orange carotenoids, respectively  <cit> , have been characterized in detail and their genomes completely sequenced  of b. firmus gb <dig> and b. indicus hu <dig>  cazymes are enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of carbohydrates that, for the great variability of their substrates, comprise an extremely vast family of proteins. cazymes are organized by the cazy database http://www.cazy.org into five main classes: i) glycoside hydrolases , comprising glycosidases and transglycosylases  <cit> , ii) glycosyl transferases , that catalyse the formation of glycosidic bonds between phospho-activated sugar residues and an acceptor such as a polysaccharide, a lipid or a protein  <cit> , iii) polysaccharide lyases  that eliminate activated glycosidic linkages present in acidic polysaccharides  <cit> , iv) carbohydrate esterases , that remove ester-based modifications  <cit> , and v) carbohydrate binding modules , non-catalytic protein domains  <cit> . each of those classes are then sub-divided into several families, that group together enzymes on the base of structural and functional properties. the number and type of cazymes carried by an organism has been used as a marker to assess the adaptation of that organism to a specific environment. examples are species of the bacteroides genus  <cit>  and the archaeon methanobrevibacter smithii  <cit>  identified as adapted to the human gut mainly based on their cazy profile.

RESULTS
b. indicus hu <dig> and b. firmus gb <dig> genomes contain high numbers of cazymes
putative cazymes in b. firmus gb <dig> and b. indicus hu <dig> were identified using the cazy annotation pipeline  and compared to those of a selection of spore-forming bacilli . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> cazymes were identified in the b. firmus and b. indicus genomes, respectively. this value is similar to the number of cazymes found in strains of the b. subtilis/b. amyloliquefaciens group, all having a total number of cazymes ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> . a lower total number of cazymes was found in the other spore-forming species considered in this study . among the analyzed species, thermophilic strains of geobacillus and alicyclobacillus and the facultative alkaliphile strain of b. pseudofirmus showed a total number of cazymes significantly lower than the other bacilli . a comparison of the five cazyme classes mostly confirmed the results obtained analyzing the total number of cazymes. in particular, like strains of the b. subtilis/b. amyloliquefaciens group, b. indicus and b. firmus showed a high number of glycoside hydrolases  and carbohydrate binding modules  and average numbers of glycosyl transferases , polysaccharide lyases  and carbohydrate esterases  .

next, we extended the analysis to the various families that constitute each of the five cazyme classes . this analysis showed that in comparison with the other bacilli considered in this study, b. indicus and b. firmus have a high number of cazymes of the gh <dig>  gt <dig> and gt <dig> families and have some cazymes of families not common in other bacilli  .

in addition, we observed the presence in gb <dig> and hu <dig> of candidate enzymes for the potential degradation of animal glycans. in particular, gb <dig> has two candidate β-n-acetylhexosaminidases  which can target host glycans as well as bacterial cell walls  <cit> , while both gb <dig> and hu <dig> have various candidate n-acetylglucosamine deacetylases  and n-acetylglucosaminidase-6p-deacetylases  that can catalyze the elimination of an acetyl group from peptidoglycan n-acetylglucosamine as well as from animal glycan containing o-acetylated sugars   <cit> .

the hydrolytic potential of b. firmus and b. indicus genomes correlates with growth on selected carbohydrates
the cazy annotation results were compared to the growth profile of b. firmus gb <dig> and b. indicus hu <dig> . overall the growth profiles of both strains on minimal medium supplemented with selected monosaccharides, disaccharides or cellulose correlated with the presence of related cazymes in their genome . b. firmus gb <dig> was able to grow efficiently in minimal medium supplemented with glucose, fructose, arabinose, mannose, xylose, sucrose or trehalose, as expected by the presence of candidate specific ghs . weak growth was observed with galactose, lactose, maltose and cellulose, while growth was not supported only by fucose . b. indicus hu <dig> was able to grow efficiently in minimal medium supplemented with glucose, fructose, mannose, maltose, sucrose or trehalose, as expected by the presence of candidate specific ghs . weak growth was supported by galactose while growth was not observed in the presence of arabinose, fucose, xylose, lactose or cellulose as sole carbon sources in agreement with the absence of candidate specific ghs .

we never observed carotenoid formation in solid minimal medium supplemented with any of the carbohydrate analyzed . when the same selected carbohydrates were used to supplement rich  medium, growth was always allowed but carotenoid formation was inhibited by all sugars able to support efficient growth as sole carbon source . galactose that, as sole carbon source, weakly supported growth of both b. firmus and b. indicus did not affect carotenoid synthesis in either organisms , while lactose, maltose and cellulose were also able to support a weak growth of b. firmus and showed a partial negative effect on carotenoid production .

results of table  <dig> are, therefore, suggestive of a catabolite repression-like control on carotenoid biosynthesis in both pigmented bacilli. a negative effect of carbohydrates on carotenoid production was not totally unexpected. although little is known about the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis in non-photosynthetic bacteria, it has been previously observed that carotenoid synthesis is repressed by glucose in various species of the genus erwinia  <cit> . genes of erwinia herbicola cloned in escherichia coli have been shown to be controlled by a camp-dependent catabolite repression mechanism  <cit> . in the gram-positive myxococcus xanthus a strong light-dependent induction of carotenoid production only occurs under conditions of carbon starvation  <cit> .

the hydrolytic potential of b. firmus and b. indicus genomes correlate with biofilm production
both b. firmus gb <dig> and b. indicus hu <dig> form biofilm in liquid and solid  media. wild strains of b. subtilis, the model system for spore-formers, form a robust extracellular matrix in which diverse subpopulations of cells involved in sporulation, motility and matrix formation are encased  <cit> . the extracellular matrix of b. subtilis is composed of two proteins, tasa and tapa  <cit>  and by an exopolysaccharide . the most common esp found in biofilm produced by b. subtilis is levan  <cit>  which can be formed by either β- <dig> -linked d-fructose units  or a fructose polymer with a glucose residue linked to the terminal fructose by α-glycoside bond . levan is synthesized outside the cell following the secretion of an extracellular levansucrase , able to transfer the fructose residue to the acceptor levan when sucrose is used as a substrate  <cit> . biofilm formation also requires the action of extracellular levanases , responsible for levan degradation  <cit> . genes for a candidate secreted levansucrase  and a candidate secreted endo-levanase  are present in the genome of b. indicus hu <dig> . the genome of b. firmus gb <dig> did not reveal the presence of enzymes involved in the synthesis of levan but contained the potentials to encode a candidate exo-inulinase  . exo-inulinases are enzymes that hydrolyze terminal, non-reducing  <dig> -linked and  <dig> -linked β-d-fructofuranose residues in inulin, levan and sucrose releasing β-d-fructose. a candidate fructan exo-inulinase  is also contained in the genome of b. indicus hu <dig> .

based on these observations we suggest that b. indicus hu <dig> produces a levan-based biofilm. additional experiments will be needed to clarify the nature of the carbohydrate present in the biofilm of b. firmus gb <dig> 

in b. subtilis levansucrases are induced by sucrose  <cit>  and levanases by low concentrations of fructose  <cit> . based on this we analyzed biofilm formation by b. firmus gb <dig> and b. indicus hu <dig> in the presence of sucrose, fructose or both sugars together. as shown in figure 3b, while in hu <dig> cells production of the levan-based biofilm was not significantly affected by the presence of fructose, sucrose or both carbohydrates, in gb <dig> cells biofilm synthesis was about two-fold induced by sucrose and this induction was reduced by the concomitantly presence of the two carbohydrates . in our standard conditions  b. indicus hu <dig>  was more efficient than b. firmus gb <dig>  in producing a biofilm.

the hydrolytic potential of b. firmus and b. indicus genomes correlate with mucin binding and degradation
mucins are a family of high molecular weight, heavily glycosylated proteins produced by epithelial cells and forming the viscoelastic gel-like layer that covers the epithelial surfaces in the mammalian gi-tract. the glycosidic part of mucin is formed by linear or branched oligosaccharides that form up to 85% of the molecule by weight. although chemically and structurally diverse, mucins invariably contain large quantities of galactose, amino sugars, fucose, have strongly polar groups, such as neuraminic  acids and sulphate at the end of the polysaccharide moiety. mucins can be degraded by several different hydrolytic enzymes to smaller oligomers, monosaccharides, and amino acids and used as carbon, nitrogen, and energy sources by colonic bacteria. it is commonly accepted that the breakdown of mucins occurs as a cooperative activity in the gut microbiota with different bacteria able to synthesize the variety of hydrolytic enzymes  needed for a complete degradation of mucins  <cit> . also important in this regard is the action of deacetylases, enzymes needed to remove o-acetylated sugars that are present at the termini of host glycans to prevent direct cleavage by microbial glycoside hydrolases. bacteria that have these enzymes therefore produce deacetylated sugars available for them and other components of the microbiota  <cit> .

the cazy annotation results are consistent with the ability of both pigmented bacilli to adhere and degrade mucin. the b. firmus gb <dig> genome encodes a candidate polypeptide n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, belonging to the gt <dig> family  and several candidate deacetylases  of the ce <dig> family and a phosphate-deacetylase  of the ce <dig> family . the b. indicus hu <dig> genome encodes a candidate secreted n-acetyl β-glucosaminidase  of the gh <dig> family, has a carbohydrate-binding module  of the cbm <dig> family and several candidate deacetylases  of the ce <dig> family and phosphate-deacetylases  of the ce <dig> family . polypeptide n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases of family gh <dig> catalyze the transfer of n-acetylgalactosamine  from the sugar donor udp-galnac to a serine or threonine residue of an acceptor polypeptide and in mammalians are involved in the initial step of o-linked protein glycosylation. the presence of a gene coding for a candidate polypeptide n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase in the genome of gb <dig> is a surprising finding and suggests the possibility that gb <dig> is able to either remodel host glycans or synthesize carbohydrate epitopes mimicking those of the host at the bacterial cell surface.

to experimentally validate those bioinformatic predictions we analyzed the ability of both pigmented bacilli to bind and degrade mucin. adhesion to mucin was assayed as previously described  <cit> . in brief,  <dig> cfu were incubated in polystyrene tubes pre-treated with mucin, washed extensively and bound bacteria released by treatment with triton x- <dig> and plate-counted . mucin degradation was assessed by a previously described plate assay  <cit> . together with the two pigmented bacilli we analyzed, as control strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg , known to bind and degrade mucin  <cit>  and l. gasseri sf <dig>  previously shown to be unable to degrade mucin  <cit> . as reported in table 4b. firmus gb <dig> adhered to mucin with the same efficiency of lgg but was unable to degrade mucin while b. indicus hu <dig> was about 10-fold more efficient than lgg in binding mucin and was also able to efficiently degrade the mammalian glycan.

CONCLUSIONS
the primary result of this work is the annotation of the cazymes of two carotenoid-producing bacilli. the genome of both the two spore formers contains an elevated number of putative cazymes, in particular of glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate binding modules. the total number of cazymes and the number of putative members of each of the five classes of cazymes indicated that both bacilli are, and in this respect, similar to the b. subtilis/b. amyloliquefaciens group of spore formers and different from thermophilic or facultative alkaliphile strains, presumably living in restrictive environmental niches.

the experimental analysis of the hydrolytic potential of b. firmus and b. indicus confirmed the genomic analysis and indicated that both bacilli are able to degrade and use as sole carbon source several different carbohydrates. this experimental analysis also allowed us to propose that in both strains a catabolite repression-like mechanism controls carotenoid biosynthesis and that the produced carotenoid is essential to fully protect the growing cells against oxygen reactive forms.

cazy analyses of the genomes of the two pigmented bacilli, validated by experimental data, also indicated that both strains are able to form biofilm and adhere/degrade mammal mucin. biofilm formation has been previously associated to a longer persistance in the gi-tract of intestinal bacilli  <cit> , while the ability to bind to and degrade mucin is believed to be a beneficial feature of intestinal bacteria enabling faster mucin turnover and, as a consequence, contributing to the integrity of the intestinal epithelium  <cit> . the ability to degrade mucin may also be an adaptive advantage for intestinal bacteria, where using mucin as a source of nutrients, can more efficiently colonize the epithelial cell surface underneath the mucus layers  <cit> .

in conclusion, our results suggest that the two pigmented bacilli, isolated from human feces  and a human ileal sample , are adapted to the intestinal environment and suited to grow and colonize the human gut.
