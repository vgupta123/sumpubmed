BACKGROUND
synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides  and bacterial dna containing unmethylated cpg dinucleotides flanked by specific base sequences  have significant immunomodulatory effects on b lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells  <cit> . experimental evidence suggests that cpg-dna induces the regulation of th1/th <dig> immune responses, antigen-presenting cell activity, and immunoglobulin  isotype switching  <cit> . therefore, cpg-dna has gained attention for its potential use as an immune adjuvant and in therapeutics for allergic and infectious diseases  <cit> .

phosphorothioate-modified types of cpg-dna , which are resistant to nuclease activity and can be efficiently delivered into cells  <cit> , have been utilized in clinical applications  <cit> . the immunomodulatory activities of ps-odn are enhanced by liposome-encapsulation  <cit> . however, several studies have suggested that ps-odn induces backbone-related side effects, such as transient splenomegaly  <cit> , lymphoid follicle destruction  <cit> , arthritis  <cit> , and ps-odn-specific igm production  <cit>  in ps-odn-treated mice. investigators consequently developed phosphodiester bond cpg-dna  as a natural counterpart of ps-odn to induce optimal innate immune responses without severe side effects. in contrast to ps-odn, the immunomodulatory effects of po-odn are found only in mouse cells and not in human cells  <cit> . however, induction of an effective immune response has been reported in human cells stimulated with po-odn and non-cpg-dna encapsulated in cationic liposomes such as n--n,n,n-trimethylammonium methylsulfate  and lipofectin  <cit> .

in previous studies, we screened natural po-odn with immunomodulatory activity from mycobacterium bovis genomic dna  <cit> . our experimental analyses demonstrated that a potent po-odn, namely mb-odn  <dig>  which contains three cpg motifs, has functional effects as a powerful adjuvant for the induction of ag-driven th <dig> responses without causing severe side effects in mice  <cit> . in this study, we compared the ability of mb-odn  <dig> encapsulated in several different liposomes to stimulate immune responses in human and mice cells, finding that mb-odn  <dig> encapsulated in a phosphatidyl-β-oleoyl-γ-palmitoyl ethanolamine :cholesterol hemisuccinate  complex ) was most potent in human as well as in mice. furthermore, we extended the research to the selection of a synthetic peptide-based b cell epitope and revealed that complexes of several peptides and lipoplex without carriers significantly enhanced the each peptide-specific igg production depending on tlr <dig>  in this study, we identified a b cell epitope peptide from hepatocellular carcinoma -specific transmembrane  <dig> superfamily member  <dig>  protein  <cit>  that potently induced epitope-specific antibodies. we also noticed that the monoclonal antibody produced by immunization with a complex consisting of antigenic peptide  and lipoplex had functional effects on cells expressing the antigen. our results suggest that the selection of b cell epitope can be facilitated by the delivery of the dope:chems complex and by the adjuvant effect of mb-odn  <dig>  our strategy may be promptly used for the development of epitope-based peptide vaccines and production of therapeutic antibodies.

RESULTS
effects of cpg-dna encapsulated in liposomes on il- <dig> promoter activation
to identify the conditions driving the effective immunomodulatory activity of po-odn in humans, we encapsulated mb-odn  <dig> in several different liposomes and compared the abilities of the complexes to stimulate immune responses in human and mouse cells. first, we confirmed that il- <dig> promoter was activated in human and mouse cells treated with cpg-dna encapsulated in liposomes. when po-odn was encapsulated in a dotap, dope:chems  complex, or  <dig> -dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine :chems:phosphatidylethanolamine-poly   complex, it activated the il- <dig> promoter in human rpmi  <dig> cells as well as in mouse raw  <dig>  cells. to confirm the significance of cpg motif of mb-odn  <dig>  we synthesized mb-odn 4531gc which has gpc dinucleotides instead of cpg dinucleotides in the mb-odn  <dig> sequence. the luciferase activity was not enhanced by mb-odn 4531gc in the mouse and human cell lines, proving that the il- <dig> promoter activation is cpg sequence-dependent . the highest activity was produced by po-odn encapsulated in dope:chems  complex. here, we named mb-odn  <dig> encapsulated in dope:chems  complex as lipoplex .

enhanced intracellular uptake of cpg-dna by encapsulation in a dope:chems complex
depending on the delivery vehicles, cpg-dna can elicit enhanced intracellular uptake, endosomal localization, and biological activity of cpg-dna  <cit> . to chase the process, we used facs to analyze the intracellular uptake of fitc-labeled mb-odn  <dig>  as shown in figure 2a, the intracellular uptake of mb-odn  <dig> is enhanced markedly when the mb-odn  <dig> is encapsulated in a dope:chems complex ). tlr9-mediated cytokine production by cpg-dna requires acidification and maturation of endosomes  <cit> . as shown in figure 2b, pretreatment with chloroquine, an inhibitor of endosomal processing, inhibits the il- <dig> promoter activation induced by lipoplex. these results confirm that the efficacy of po-odn can be enhanced by encapsulation in a dope:chems complex via the improved intracellular uptake of cpg-dna and endosomal localization.

effects of cpg-dna encapsulated in dope:chems complex on cytokine production
to determine the effects of lipoplex  on cytokine production, we treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  or mouse splenocytes with  <dig> μg/ml of nonencapsulated cpg-dna or lipoplex for  <dig> h. the cpg-dna failed to induce the release of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-γ in human pbmcs when treated as a free form. in contrast, lipoplex induced the release of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-γ in a cpg sequence-dependent manner from human pbmcs and mouse splenocytes . when mb-odn  <dig> or lipoplex was applied in vivo, lipoplex induced secretion of il- <dig> and ifn-γ for much longer periods than mb-odn  <dig> did . it may be related with the enhanced stability of mb-odn  <dig> in vivo when encapsulated in dope:chems complex. as expected, the immunomodulatory activity of lipoplex was entirely tlr9-dependent; cytokine production was not found in tlr9-/- mice . these results confirm that cytokine secretion was increased by lipoplex in a cpg sequence- and tlr9-dependent manner.

adjuvant activity of cpg-dna encapsulated in dope:chems complex
to evaluate the adjuvant activity of cpg-dna encapsulated in liposomes, we immunized balb/c mice with different combinations of hen egg lysozyme , mb-odn  <dig>  and dope:chems complex . immunization of balb/c mice with hel only or with hel encapsulated in dope:chems complex did not induce hel-specific igg. immunization with a mixture of hel and mb-odn  <dig>  there was increased production of hel-specific total igg, which can be resulted from the adjuvant effect of mb-odn  <dig>  most importantly, immunization with a complex consisting of hel and lipoplex  + hel) resulted in a markedly greater abundance of hel-specific total igg than other mice. amount of hel-specific total igg induced by a complex of hel and lipoplex was approximately four times higher than that induced by a mixture of hel and mb-odn  <dig> . titers of hel-specific total igg also show similar results . next, we confirmed the igg isotype of anti-hel-specific antibodies. remarkably, immunization with a complex of hel and lipoplex or a mixture of hel and mb-odn  <dig> induced more igg2a than igg <dig>  indicating that mb-odn  <dig> affects isotype profile independently of encapsulation . however, immunization with a mixture of hel and incomplete freund's adjuvant  induced higher level of igg <dig> than igg2a. based on the result from the lipoplexgc plus hel, we confirmed that lipoplex-mediated hel-specific antibody production is cpg sequence-dependent which is in accordance with the data in figure  <dig>  when we performed the same experiments with another antigen ovalbumin , lipoplex plus ova appears to induce more igg2a and hence a more balanced response than ifa plus ova as shown in figure 4c and 4d.

th1-dominated humoral immune response induced by peptide epitope and cpg-dna encapsulated in dope:chems complex
as the potent adjuvant effect of lipoplex was identified in figure  <dig>  we applied this system to the screening of b cell epitopes against tumor-specific antigen. specifically, we aimed to screen b cell epitopes originated from human tetraspanin transmembrane  <dig> superfamily member  <dig> of human hcc    <cit> . six candidate peptide sequences were selected from extracellular domain of htm4sf <dig> protein on the basis of their hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, secondary structure, antigenicity index as described in "methods" .

first, we screened the b cell epitopes of htm4sf <dig> protein. we analyzed the amounts of igg in the serum of balb/c mice injected i.p. with complexes of each predicted htm4sf <dig> peptide and lipoplex. as shown in figure 5a, the production of peptide-specific igg was most enhanced by a complex consisting of htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide and lipoplex. anti-htm4sf5r2-3-specific antibodies were mostly composed of igg2a . we evaluated the kinetics of igg production in immunized mice in response to the complex of htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide and lipoplex. the mice produced larger amounts of peptide-specific igg  during the secondary and tertiary responses . when the mice were immunized with htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide and mb-odn  <dig> co-encapsulated in other liposomes, the production of peptide-specific igg was much lower, which demonstrates the superior effect of lipoplex . however, mb-odn 4531gc containing a reversal sequence of the cg dinucleotide lost its ability to stimulate production of igg . igg production by htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide and lipoplex was dependent on tlr <dig>  whereas igg production by antigen and ifa was not . these results indicate that the complex of htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide and lipoplex without carriers significantly enhanced production of peptide-specific igg2a in a cpg sequence-dependent and tlr9-dependent manner.

functional effect of anti-htm4sf <dig> monoclonal antibody on hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro
the expression of tm4sf <dig> induced uncontrolled growth of human hcc cells via loss of contact inhibition  <cit> . to evaluate the functional effects of igg produced by immunization with the complex of htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide and lipoplex, we screened monoclonal antibody against htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide and confirmed its specificity by competition elisa using htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide . we then analyzed the expression of htm4sf <dig> in human hcc cell lines and evaluated the monoclonal antibody-mediated htm4sf <dig> targeting in the cells. the expression of htm4sf <dig> was detected in huh- <dig> and snu- <dig> cells at the mrna by rt-pcr  and protein levels by immunoblotting and facs analysis with the htm4sf5-specific monoclonal antibody . to investigate the effect of the anti-htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide monoclonal antibody on cell growth, we performed mtt assay. the growth of huh- <dig> cells expressing htm4sf <dig> was markedly delayed by antibody treatment. however, there was no significant reduction in the growth of snu- <dig> cells, which did not express htm4sf <dig> . the population of cells in s phase was also reduced in huh- <dig> cells but not snu- <dig> cells  to further investigate the effects of the anti-htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide antibody on dna synthesis, the brdu incorporation assay was performed. as shown in figure 8c, the rate of dna synthesis in huh- <dig> cells treated with anti-htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide monoclonal antibody was weakly affected one day after treatment and further suppressed in three days by approximately 40% compared to normal igg treated-huh- <dig> cells . in contrast, there was no effect in snu- <dig> cells. next, we investigated whether the anti-htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide antibody induces apoptotic response of huh- <dig> cells. as shown in figure 8d, the treatment of anti-htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide antibody did not lead to an increase in the number of apoptotic cells containing double-stranded dna breaks in huh- <dig> cells or snu- <dig> cells. therefore, we conclude that the anti-htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide antibody has anti-proliferative effect rather than pro-apoptotic effect in huh- <dig> cells. these results confirm that the monoclonal antibody produced by immunization with htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide and lipoplex complex was useful for htm4sf <dig> protein detection and antibody-mediated htm4sf <dig> targeting in hcc cells.

discussion
the application of cpg-dna to therapeutics can be optimized via sequence rearrangement and backbone modification  <cit> . the recognition of cpg-dna by tlr <dig> varies from mice to human immune cells due to a 24% difference at the amino acid level between the tlr <dig> molecules of mice and humans  <cit> . ps-odn stimulates the human and mouse immune systems in several ways: efficient uptake into cells, endosomal acidification and maturation, and enhanced recognition by tlr <dig> in endosomes and lysosomes  <cit> . however, po-odn, which exhibits immunomodulatory activity in mice, shows poor activity in hpbmcs  <cit> . recently, the cationic liposome dotap was used as a vehicle for delivery; it was found to improve the uptake of po-odn as well as the production of ifn-α in hpbmcs  <cit> . here, we examined the effects of liposome-encapsulated po-odn on cytokine promoter activation and cytokine production in mouse and human cells. after stimulation with po-odn encapsulated in liposomes such as dotap, dope:chems complex, and dspc:chems:peg-pe complex, the il- <dig> promoter was significantly activated in human and mouse cells and maximum activity was seen with po-odn encapsulated in dope:chems complex ) .

recent studies by several investigators have shown that cpg-dna has functional effects as a th1-responsive adjuvant and that its potent adjuvant effects are enhanced by liposome encapsulation  <cit> . in this report, we found that lipoplex surpassed ifa in terms of the potency of antigen-specific igg production and th1-type immune responses in mice : higher titers and more igg2a. this outstanding adjuvant effect of lipoplex in mice is very interesting and suggests that lipoplex could have a promising adjuvant effect in humans. the potency of lipoplex seems to be derived from the improved intracellular uptake of cpg-dna and endosomal localization , and enhanced or prolonged production of cytokines such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-γ .

the screening of synthetic peptide-based epitopes has been studied extensively for the purpose of developing therapeutic antibodies and vaccines that have potential as prophylactics for cancer and infectious diseases such as influenza virus, malaria, hepatitis b, and hiv  <cit> . although peptide vaccines have been actively studied in various animal models, their efficacy in the treatment of humans is limited. to improve the efficacy of peptide vaccines, researchers have evaluated liposomes as a means of delivering vaccines  <cit> . adjuvants such as flagella  <cit>  and cpg-dna  <cit>  have also been formulated in order to enhance the magnitude of the immune responses. in this study, we performed peptide-based epitope screening and used complex of synthetic peptide and lipoplex without carriers to produce antibodies that act against htm4sf <dig> in human hcc. we successfully screened a potent b cell epitope  from htm4sf <dig> . we found that lipoplex surpassed ifa and other forms of liposome-encapsulated cpg-dna in terms of the potency of peptide-specific igg production and th1-type immune responses in mice . therefore, our data offer a powerful tool for practical use: lipoplex is a potentially applicable universal adjuvant for peptide-based epitope screening and antibody production, and it obviates the need for other adjuvants and carriers. however, further study is needed to investigate whether or not igg production induced by a complex of b cell epitope and lipoplex is dependent on mhc type, cd4+ cells and th <dig> differentiation and if a novel mechanism is involved .

examination of the igg isotype levels demonstrates that the peptide and lipoplex complex induced higher levels of igg2a than igg <dig>  indicating a predominant th <dig> response. it is well-known that differential induction of th1-type or th2-type immune response by a vaccine is important for protective immunity in specified infectious diseases. for example, several studies have reported that formalin-inactivated human respiratory syncytial virus  vaccine was not effective because of its ability to induce an allergy-like th <dig> immune response against the virus infection  <cit> . therefore, our formulation may be applied as an effective adjuvant for peptide-based rsv b cell epitope screening and effective rsv vaccine: the formulation may decrease susceptibility to rsv and induce th1-biased or balanced th1/th <dig> adaptive immune response leading to the production of neutralizing antibodies.

this study suggest that lipoplex is a potent adjuvant and that complexes of epitope and lipoplex without carriers are extremely useful for b cell epitope screening and peptide-specific antibody production. as our novel vaccine strategy using lipoplex and synthetic peptide does not require protein antigen production and carrier conjugation, it is cost effective and enables rapid application. for example, tm4sf <dig> protein has gained attention as a target for hcc therapy since it is overexpressed in hcc  <cit> . tm4sf <dig> is also important in hcc formation by inducing morphological elongation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, abnormal cell growth in multilayers in vitro, and tumor formation in vivo. but there was no report regarding epitope-specific monoclonal antibody against tm4sf <dig> yet. as indicated in a detailed study, we successfully produced monoclonal antibody without production of recombinant protein. the anti-htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide-specific antibody can detect native protein and induce functional changes in cells expressing tm4sf <dig> protein, which suggests possible application in therapeutics . we are currently investigating whether or not anti-htm4sf5r2- <dig> peptide-specific antibody can reduce hcc tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model after huh- <dig> cells have been injected. we applied our strategy to monomeric peptide and produced antibody recognizing native protein in this study. whether our technology can also be applied to conformationally dependent epitopes or poorly immunogenic peptides is to be determined in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
our overall results show that lipoplex is a potent adjuvant and that complexes of epitope and lipoplex without carriers are extremely useful for b cell epitope screening and peptide-specific antibody production. therefore, our strategy may be promptly used for the development of therapeutic antibodies by rapid screening of potent b cell epitopes .
