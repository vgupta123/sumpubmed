BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium is an environmental mycobacterium that can be divided into the subspecies avium, hominissuis, paratuberculosis and silvaticum  <cit> . m. avium is ubiquitous in nature and can be isolated from natural sources of water, soil, plants and bedding material  <cit> .

m. avium subsp. avium and hominssuis are opportunistic pathogens for animals and humans  <cit> . they can cause generalised tuberculosis in poultry and wild birds, while mammals, especially pigs, usually develop localised lesions limited to the lymph nodes of the digestive tract  <cit> . previously, lung infections were the most common manifestation of disease due to m. avium in humans. most of these patients had predisposing lung disorders or underlying immunodeficiency. since the emergence of aids, disseminated disease has become more common  <cit> . however, the bacterium can also infect otherwise healthy people, and children can develop subacute lymphadenitis. in norway, about  <dig> people get infected with mycobacteria other than those of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex each year. the majority of these are infected with m. avium  <cit> .

the m. avium subspecies are a heterogeneous group and strain identification and classification has been based on serotyping and also on molecular methods based on different genomic targets including the presence and distribution of various insertion sequences . differences between isolates of m. avium from birds and the human and porcine isolates have been described. most avian isolates belong to serotype 1– <dig>  <cit> , contain is <dig>  and have a distinct pattern by is <dig> and is <dig> rflp. they have one copy of is <dig> and two copies of is <dig> when using the shorter and more specific probes as previously described  <cit> . occasionally, humans and pigs may get infected with strains with the classical bird pattern, but generally isolates from humans and pigs do not harbour is <dig>  might harbour ismpa <dig>  <cit>  and show another distribution of is <dig> and is <dig> elements  <cit> . it was recently proposed to reserve the term m. avium subsp. avium for strains with the bird pattern, and to call the other strains for m. avium subsp. hominissuis  <cit> . both is <dig> and is <dig> rflp have been used to compare isolates from humans and animals in different regions of the world  <cit> , and their discriminatory power has been judged to be almost equal  <cit> . information about what kind of m. avium strains that infect human patients, animals and birds in norway has not been obtained until now.

is <dig> shares an 85% dna sequence homology with is <dig>  <cit>  and the  <dig> bp is <dig> probe used for rflp by the proposed standardised method  <cit>  share an identity of 82% with is <dig> at the dna level. a problem with the standardised is <dig> rflp method in m. avium has been the occurrence of several weak and inconsistent bands, probably due to cross hybridisation  <cit> . we previously designed specific probes for is <dig> and is <dig> that eliminated the possibility of cross hybridisation. both probes were chosen from the 5' end of each insertion element where there is a 75% homology between the two elements  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate and compare the typing potential of the new probes for is <dig> and is <dig> rflp  <cit> , by typing a large number of isolates from different hosts. furthermore we wanted to examine isolates of m. avium subsp. avium and hominssuis from humans, pigs and wild birds in norway, in order to determine which type of strains that infect the different hosts. the isolates were compared both by is <dig> and is <dig> rflp, and the presence of is <dig> and ismpa <dig>  <cit> . the study demonstrated that the new probes for is <dig> and is <dig> rflp performed well, and that a wide range of m. avium subsp. hominissuis strains were present in pigs and humans in norway, and that some of these isolates were very similar.

RESULTS
the resulting dendrogram of the cluster analysis is generated from the composite data sets of both the is <dig> and is <dig> rflp as described in the bionumerics manual . clusters where isolates shared 80% or greater similarity were framed and designated with the capital letters a-n. the m. avium isolates demonstrated a high diversity . the degree of clustering was high  when the 80% cluster cut off was used. on the other hand, when the cluster cut off was set at 100%, the degree of clustering was very low .

rflp typing with the new and shorter probes reduced the problems of low intensity bands. the m. avium isolates included in the current study, carried between one and nine copies of is <dig>  the rflp patterns were clear and low intensity bands were only observed for a few isolates. the analysis could be done manually. the current isolates carried between one and  <dig> copies of is <dig> that could be identified by rflp. since the isolates carried more copies of is <dig> and because this probe produced more low intensity bands than is <dig>  the is <dig> rflp was more complex and difficult to analyse than the is <dig> rflp. the discriminatory power of the rflp was, however, higher when the is <dig> probe was used. figure  <dig> illustrates that a set of eleven isolates with indistinguishable banding pattern by is <dig> rflp, could be differentiated using the is <dig> rflp.

bird isolates
nine bird isolates and the reference strain r <dig> had identical banding profile with two copies of is <dig> and one copy of is <dig>  this profile is illustrated by only one isolate  in figure  <dig>  cluster n. the last isolate, # <dig>  which originated from a black grouse, was of the multibanded type with both probes. by use of rflp, we identified  <dig> copies of is <dig>  in addition to  <dig> copies of is <dig>  the rflp patterns of this isolate clustered with two porcine isolates, # <dig> and # <dig> . the three isolates were identical by is <dig> rflp but slight differences were observed when is <dig> rflp was used. the cluster analysis from the composite data set showed 92% similarity between isolate # <dig> and isolate # <dig> and 89% similarity between # <dig> and # <dig> . all bird isolates except # <dig> harboured is <dig>  and none harboured the ismpa <dig> element.

porcine and human isolates
all isolates from swine and humans were m. avium subsp. hominissuis; they lacked is <dig>  and none of them showed the bird pattern on is <dig> and is <dig> rflp. the majority of the isolates were multibanded; however, some had only one or two copies of is <dig> that could be identified by rflp. one copy of is <dig> and two copies of is <dig> were observed for the porcine isolate # <dig>  but the pattern was different from that observed in isolates from birds.

several different rflp patterns were detected, and a few isolates with identical patterns were found. the isolates of porcine and human origin were grouped into thirteen clusters, named a-m, . the largest cluster, cluster e contained  <dig> isolates. among them,  <dig> were of porcine origin, and  <dig>  of these originated from the same county; rogaland . among the remaining  <dig> porcine isolates that were not included in cluster e, only six  originated from rogaland. two sets of the porcine isolates in cluster e were identical by both rflps, # <dig> and # <dig>  and # <dig> and # <dig>  these isolates originated from rogaland, but not from the same farms. the  <dig> isolates of human origin that were assigned to cluster e were distributed between the porcine isolates, and the patients lived in different counties in norway. one of these  was identical to one isolate of porcine origin  by is <dig> and is <dig> rflp. the pig originated from rogaland and the person was a resident of the neighbouring county aust-agder. all isolates in cluster e were negative for ismpa <dig> 

the remaining  <dig> clusters, a-d and f-m, included 2– <dig> isolates. two clusters included three porcine isolates  that carried 100% identical is <dig> and is <dig> rflp patterns. also, cluster a included two porcine isolates that were identical by both rflp methods. the identical isolates originated from the same counties, but not from the same farms.

among the porcine isolates, ten were positive for ismpa <dig>  none of the isolates of human or avian origin harboured this element. all ismpa <dig> positive isolates were grouped separately from most of the other isolates. the branch that includes these ten isolates is labelled with an asterisk  in figure  <dig>  the porcine isolates in this branch all came from the same part of norway, mainly from vestfold, but also from the two neighbouring counties akershus and buskerud .

four farms were represented by more than one porcine isolate. of these, # <dig> and # <dig> were isolated from one farm, # <dig>  # <dig> and # <dig> from a second farm, # <dig> and # <dig> from a third farm and # <dig> and # <dig> from a fourth farm. none of them were identical to other isolates from the same farm, and the similarity between them was quite low, ranging from 66%  to 28% . interestingly, among these nine isolates, four carried rflp patterns that were 100% identical to at least one isolate from another farm in the same county.

the isolates of human origin were distributed randomly among the isolates from pigs. there was no clustering of isolates according to type of clinical symptoms or to geographical location of the patients' home addresses .

discussion
the new short probes performed well for typing m. avium isolates. based on these probes, it was demonstrated for the first time in norway that isolates from birds were mainly m. avium subsp. avium and that isolates from humans and pigs were m. avium subsp. hominissuis. a geographical distribution of isolates of porcine origin was found, and similar isolates from humans and pigs were common.

the two probes differed in their typing potential and could have different areas of application. the is <dig> rflp gave fewer bands than the is <dig> rflp on the majority of the human and porcine isolates. this made the interpretation of the analysis easier, but the discriminatory power was weaker than for the is <dig> rflp. in other studies the discriminatory power of the two rflp methods have been almost equal  <cit> . the is <dig> rflp patterns can be analysed manually, if expensive software is not available. comparison of is <dig> rflp and is <dig> rflp showed that is <dig> rflp can be a good choice for several typing purposes. one can improve the separation of m. avium isolates by combining the two methods. for example, the is <dig> rflp could be useful when comparing isolates of m. avium from different countries or parts of the world. the interpretation of results from this method is fairly easy to calibrate, since it generates fewer bands and because low intensity bands are uncommon. in an international setting the is <dig> rflp may be applied to detect major differences between isolates within m. avium. the is <dig> rflp is also considered to be well suited for a primary screening when isolate comparison is needed. when the discrimination of isolates has to be of a higher level, such as in outbreak investigations, inquiries of possible laboratory contamination and in contact tracing, the combination of the two rflp methods appears to be the ideal.

nine of ten avian isolates in our material belonged to the well described bird type of m. avium subsp.avium. the isolate # <dig> that originated from a black grouse was negative for is <dig> and had a multibanded profile with is <dig> and is <dig> rflp. the finding of a m. avium subsp. hominissuis isolate from birds seems to be an exception, but has been described earlier  <cit> . m. avium subsp. avium is the cause of avian tuberculosis and is known to be a contagious disease among birds  <cit> , while m. avium subsp. hominissuis probably behaves as an opportunistic environmental pathogens in birds like it does in mammals.

the isolates of human and porcine origin in our material were all m. avium subsp. hominissuis. most of these isolates had multibanded rflp profiles on both is <dig> and is <dig> and none harboured is <dig>  a few isolates showed a low copy number, especially with is <dig> rflp, and one isolate  had only one copy of is <dig>  however, these isolates were all easily differentiated from the bird type. m. avium subsp.avium has been detected in human patients  <cit> , pigs and other animals  <cit> , however this seems to be rare. many m. avium subsp. hominissuis isolates of human and porcine origin were clustered together when the cut off was set at 80%, and one porcine and one human isolate were identical .

the isolates from human patients did not show any significant clustering with respect to clinical symptoms, age or immune status. this was in accordance with earlier studies; since differences between isolates from children and adults and isolates from hiv infected and not hiv infected patients could not be detected  <cit> .

the porcine isolates that were grouped into the same clusters with 80% or greater similarity generally originated from the same geographical areas. a total of  <dig> of  <dig> isolates from rogaland  belonged to the largest cluster, cluster e. in this county, there was a special focus on environmental mycobacteria in the period from  <dig> to  <dig>  an unusual number of children at the schools of karmøy, rogaland showed hypersensitivity reactions when challenged with the tuberculin skin test without any signs of infection with bacteria in the m. tuberculosis complex. the reactions were suspected to be due to a sensitisation to environmental mycobacteria, especially m. avium. at the same time personnel at a slaughter house in rogaland showed increased reactions to the skin test following a period of an unusually high occurrence of mycobacteriosis in swine at the same slaughterhouse  <cit> . the number of swine with tuberculous lesions in norway varies between areas and from year to year. there have been few investigations to find the prevalence of these lesions, but one investigation at the meat inspection in haugesund  performed between  <dig> and  <dig> found tuberculous lesions in about  <dig> – <dig> % of the swine slaughtered  <cit> .

our data suggest that birds are not a natural source of infection with m. avium for humans or swine in norway, and our findings are similar to those reported in other studies  <cit> . however, in a swedish study, about half of the isolates from pigs were of the bird type, indicating that birds might be the cause of infection for pigs  <cit> . in the present study, humans and swine might have infected each other, although we consider it more likely that the two species are infected from similar environmental sources. this was strengthened by the observation that among animals from the same farms, different m. avium subsp.hominissuis isolates were found. the geographical clustering of the porcine isolates in our material also suggest that bacteria in the same area are more closely related to each other than to bacteria in another areas, and that pigs on different farms may have been infected from the same environmental source. m. avium has been isolated from different kinds of vegetables  <cit> , and a food isolate was identical to an isolate from a human patient when compared by a pcr based typing method  <cit> . other potential environmental sources of mycobacteria for both humans and swine are soil and water. m. avium has been isolated from potted plants  <cit> , and from peat  <cit> . identical isolates of m. avium have been found in samples from peat and human patients  <cit>  and in samples from peat and pigs  <cit> . it appears that soil and water may represent the m. avium reservoir for mammals, including humans, in norway as in other countries  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrated that the new probes for is <dig> and is <dig> rflp performed well for typing the isolates, and that m. avium subsp. avium were detected only among birds in norway. in pigs and humans, however, a wide range of m. avium subsp.hominissuis are present and some of these isolates are very similar. it remains to be determined whether humans are infected from pigs or if they are infected from common environmental sources.
