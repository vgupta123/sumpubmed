BACKGROUND
mitochondria participate in a number of essential cellular functions, for example they are key players in atp production, via the process of oxidative phosphorylation, which can produce up to  <dig> times more atp from glucose than glycolysis alone. they are also central to metabolic regulation and facilitate diverse cell signaling events  <cit> . mitochondria are therefore essential for the maintenance, adaptability and survival of eukaryotic cells. in addition, these remarkable organelles have been conclusively shown to play a role in the regulation of programmed cell death processes , and act as an important determinants of cellular senescence and ageing  <cit> . the importance of understanding how mitochondria influence the metabolic status of cells becomes apparent when we consider that many muscular and neurodegenerative diseases have been linked with their dysfunction. the current list of disease pathologies in which mitochondrial function is thought to be a major contributing factor is extensive and includes diabetes  <cit> , cancer  <cit> , multiple sclerosis  <cit> , alzheimer's  <cit>  and parkinson's  <cit> . good evidence also exists that indicates a loss of mitochondrial function occurs during the progression of normal ageing  <cit> . mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species , which are implicated in both ageing and apoptosis  <cit> , presumably as a result of their ability to damage macromolecules.

the control of mitochondrial biogenesis is complex, requiring coordinated transcription of a large number of nuclear and mitochondria encoded genes. in addition, there must be concerted control of the synthesis, import, and incorporation of proteins and lipids to existing mitochondria alongside appropriate replication of the mitochondrial dna . in mammalian cells a number of have been indentified that act to co-ordinate tissue specific mitochondrial biogenesis in the face of altered metabolic demand and environmental change, including; nuclear respiratory factor- <dig>  and ga-binding protein , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors , mitochondrial transcription factors tfam, tfb1m and tfb2m, estrogen-related receptors  . the mitochondria of yeast are also adapted to respond to rapidly changing metabolic demands. for example switching between fermentative and non-fermentative carbon sources requires adjustment of mitochondrial activity and density  <cit> . however despite the importance of the mitochondria to cellular function, the signaling mechanisms by which their activity is co-ordinated with environmental conditions in yeast are not well documented.

previous studies in yeast have established links between ras signaling and mitochondrial function, via camp/pka dependent and independent routes  <cit> . within yeast ras/camp/pka signaling also controls cellular processes that include cell growth and proliferation and the induction of stress responses  <cit> , making this pathway a good candidate to integrate environmental signaling with mitochondrial regulation. in yeast, protein kinase a  consists of a single regulatory subunit encoded by the bcy <dig> gene  <cit>  and three catalytic subunits tpk1p, tpk2p and tpk3p  <cit> . pka is activated by an increase in camp concentration, which is generated in the cell from adenylyl cyclase, cyr1p  <cit> . the three catalytic subunits of yeast exhibit high similarity and have been shown to have both specific and overlapping functions. for instance tpk2p has been shown to influence iron uptake, trehalase synthesis, water homeostasis  <cit>  and pseudohyphal growth  <cit> . tpk1p has been implicated in the branched chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway, mitochondrial iron homeostasis and mtdna stability  <cit> . excessive pka activity can prove deleterious, for instance the overexpression of tpk <dig> has been shown to inhibit growth  <cit> . an important regulator of cyr1p activation is the small regulatory gtpase ras  <cit> . the regulation of camp production from cyr1p in response to ras activation also requires the protein srv2p/cap  <cit> , which is able to bind both adenylyl cyclase and actin structures. we have shown previously that the accumulation of stable actin aggregates leads to the hyperactivation of the ras/camp/pka pathway  <cit> . the result of actin aggregation induced ras/camp/pka signaling is that ros are produced from dysfunctional mitochondria, facilitating cell death that displays hallmarks of yeast apoptosis  <cit> . the deletion of tpk <dig> is sufficient to prevent the production of ros in actin aggregating strains, implicating this pka subunit as a regulator of mitochondrial function  <cit> . further evidence for a role of tpk3p in the regulation of mitochondrial function comes from a study in which cells lacking tpk3p showed reduced respiratory activity  <cit> .

here we demonstrate that increased tpk3p activity is sufficient to induce formation of dysfunctional mitochondria with striking morphological abnormalities that produce high levels of ros. we provide evidence that the loss of mitochondria function and ros production associated with elevated tpk3p activity arises as a result of transcriptional changes that inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis, corrupt the electron transport chain and inhibit stress response mechanisms. we also show that the loss of mitochondrial function and production of ros requires the activity of the transcriptional regulators hap <dig>  sok <dig> and sko <dig>  this paper therefore establishes important links between camp/pka signaling, nutritional sensing, mitochondrial biogenesis and ros production.

RESULTS
camp/pka regulation of respiratory function
our previous studies have shown that aggregation of the actin cytoskeleton results in hyperactivation of the ras/camp/pka signaling pathway, leading to the loss of respiratory function, ros production and an apoptotic cell death  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae genome encodes for three pka subunits, encoded by tpk <dig>  tpk <dig> and tpk <dig>  in order to establish which pka subunits were required to induce the loss of respiration and ros production, we generated a series of mutant strains expressing either a single pka isoform, or combinations of multiple subunit encoding genes. using this genetic approach we were able to assess the influence of individual pka isoforms on respiratory function during normal growth, or under conditions of elevated camp. elevation of camp levels was achieved by the deletion of the high affinity camp phosphodiesterase, pde <dig>  which catalyses the breakdown of camp. the loss of pde2p function allows manipulation of levels of this secondary messenger by exogenous camp addition  <cit> . we performed high resolution respirometry on pka mutant strains grown for  <dig> h to diauxic shift in the presence or absence of  <dig> mm camp, using an oroboros oxygraph, which accurately measures changes in oxygen concentration in a sealed system. by measuring the fall in oxygen concentration within the chamber the oxygen flux can be determined. oxygen consumption, which occurs at the cytochrome c oxidase complex , is a direct measure of electron transport system  activity. using this sensitive technique it was possible to detect a significant reduction in respiratory activity in wild type cells grown in the presence of exogenous camp . interestingly, the loss of pde <dig> led to a significant increase in respiration, while addition of further camp in this background led to a dramatic reduction in oxygen consumption. these results suggest that the level of respiratory activity is modulated in response to variation of intracellular camp levels.

the addition of camp to cells lacking both pde <dig> and the tpk <dig> subunit genes led to a reduction in respiration similar to that observed in the Δpde <dig> single mutant. however while the level of routine respiration differed between strains , triple mutant Δpde2Δtpk2Δtpk <dig>  Δpde2Δtpk1Δtpk <dig> or Δpde2Δtpk1Δtpk <dig> strains did not exhibit the collapse of respiratory activity observed Δpde <dig> or Δpde2Δtpk <dig> cells when camp levels were elevated . similarly Δpde2Δtpk <dig> or Δpde2Δtpk <dig> double mutant cells were resistant to the effects of elevated camp. collectively these data suggest that the collapse of respiration observed in Δpde <dig> cells when grown in the presence of exogenous camp requires the presence of both tpk <dig> and tpk <dig>  but occurs independently of tpk <dig> 

we then examined the accumulation of ros in response to camp elevation within cell populations expressing tpk1p, tpk2p or tpk3p as their sole source of pka activity . we found that the elevation of camp in strains expressing tpk <dig> only resulted in no difference in the number of cells producing high ros levels within a population . in contrast, cells expressing tpk <dig> or tpk <dig> only did show an increase in the number of ros producing cells when camp levels were increased . these data are in accordance with the findings in figure 1a, that both tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> play a role in the regulation of respiratory activity in response to camp elevation. however it should be noted that cells expressing tpk <dig> only displayed the most significant increase in the number of ros producing cells , indicating that this pka subunit may play a more fundamental role in the regulation of radical production.

tpk3p activity is sufficient to induce respiratory collapse and ros production
although tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> would appear to be essential to induce the collapse of respiration under conditions of elevated camp , our previous data points to the loss of tpk3p as sufficient to prevent ros production from the mitochondria when camp levels are raised  <cit> . we therefore sought to characterise in detail the mitochondrial defects associated with elevated tpk3p activity. wild type, Δpde <dig>  Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> and Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> + tpk <dig> strains were cultured for  <dig> hours in media supplemented with 2% glucose to the diauxic shift phase of growth. during the diauxic shift cells sense a reduction in glucose and prepare to shift to a non-fermentative metabolism, which requires functional mitochondria. at this stage the basal, or routine, level of respiration was assessed . following stabilisation of routine respiration, the atpsynthase/complex v inhibitor, triethyltin bromide  was used to determine leak flux  which represents non-phosphorylating respiration due to proton leakage back across the inner mitochondrial membrane. oligomycin is commonly used for this purpose  <cit>  but we found that the by <dig> background was resistant to its effects. tet can also be utilised to inhibit complex v  <cit>  and following titration studies a concentration of  <dig> μm was found to be effective for this purpose in our strain background. following treatment with tet, cells were exposed to  <dig> μm fccp, a protonophore, which is able to dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential. the proton gradient is a major control point of the ets and its removal allows quantification of the maximum capacity of the ets . a second dose of  <dig> μm fccp  was administered to demonstrate that  <dig> μm fccp was sufficient for complete uncoupling and the induction of maximal respiration. finally, cells were exposed to the complex iii inhibitor antimycin a which prevents all mitochondrial related oxygen consumption . this allows quantification of nmt mediated respiration for subtraction from all data. however in our experiments no oxygen consumption was recorded in this respiratory state, indicating that no non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption was detectable in our system using this strain background.

typical respirometry profiles for wild type and Δpde <dig> cells cultured in the presence of  <dig> mm camp are presented . significant differences were apparent between the respirometry profiles obtained for wild type and Δpde <dig> strains when grown in the presence of exogenous camp. while wild type cells typically demonstrated a routine respiration of around  <dig> pmols/s/ <dig> cells under these conditions, cells lacking pde <dig> showed a significant reduction, typically less than  <dig> pmols/s/ <dig> cells . this suggests that high levels of camp signaling suppress the respiratory activity of yeast mitochondria. to investigate this further we examined the respirometry profiles of wild type, Δpde <dig>  Δpde2Δtpk <dig> and Δpde2Δtpk <dig> + tpk <dig> grown in the presence or absence of camp . when cultured in the absence of camp both wild type and the double mutant  displayed similar routine respiration rates and maximal ets levels upon fccp addition. interestingly the single mutant, Δpde <dig>  showed a 20% increase in routine respiration and a maximal ets that appeared higher than wild type when grown in the absence of additional camp . overexpression of tpk <dig> from a plasmid in Δpde2Δtpk <dig> resulted in a significant reduction in routine respiration, and notably cells failed to significantly increase respiration rate upon fccp addition. in all strains the leak level of respiration appeared to be constant .

the addition of  <dig> mm camp did appear to have a small effect on respiratory activity in wild type cells using this highly sensitive assay. we observed a 17% reduction in routine respiration when compared to wild type cells cultured without camp. a similar reduction was observed in the leak level of respiration, but the maximal ets level remained unchanged. when cells lacking pde <dig> were grown in the presence of exogenous camp we consistently observed a dramatic fall in routine respiration and maximal ets rate . confirmation that tpkp <dig> was responsible was obtained as respiratory activity was largely restored in Δpde2Δtpk <dig> cells grown under the same conditions . further evidence was obtained by the re-expression of tpk <dig> in Δpde2Δtpk <dig> cells which resulted in the loss of respiration in the presence of exogenous camp. in addition, the addition of fccp did not elevate respiration in either Δpde2Δtpk <dig> or Δpde2Δtpk3+tpk <dig> cells, pointing to a loss of proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, further supporting the notion that elevated tpkp <dig> activity leads to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. the data provided may also suggest that elevated levels of tpk3p activity leads to reduction in the levels of complete and functional electron transport complexes.

effects of tpk <dig> on ros production and mitochondrial morphology
to establish whether elevated tpk3p activity was sufficient to induce ros production, wild type, Δpde <dig>  Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> and Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> + tpk <dig> cultures were grown in the presence of the fluorescent indicator dye h2dcf-da. samples were anlaysed by flow cytometry as well as visually under a fluorescent microscope . in the presence of camp wild type cells were found to be generally unaffected, presumably as they were able to breakdown additional camp . however the loss of pde2p, and hence the ability to efficiently break down camp, resulted in a significant increase in ros accumulating cells . the additional loss of tpk <dig> in cells lacking pde <dig> resulted in a significant reduction in the number of ros positive population . importantly the re-expression of tpk <dig> on a plasmid in Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> cells restored production of ros .

in order to investigate the effects of tpk3p on mitochondrial morphology we made use of a plasmid that allows the expression of a mitochondrial targeted rfp protein  . while a reticular network was seen in wild-type cells, mitochondria in Δpde <dig> mutant cells appeared reduced in number, were fragmented and visibly enlarged when grown in the presence of exogenous camp . the abnormal mitochondria observed could be restored to a wild type appearance in cells lacking both pde <dig> and tpk <dig> . we also noted that in the Δpde <dig> mutant only a few enlarged structures of mtdna could be seen when compared to the numerous structures visible in wild type . in line with the improvement in mitochondrial morphology, the number of mt nucleoids was increased in Δpde2Δtpk <dig> cells . in addition fragmentation of genomic dna  was apparent in Δpde <dig> cells, a phenotype indicative of apoptosis. in contrast nuclear dna fragmentation did not appear in Δpde2Δtpk <dig> cells , consistent with our previous reports that tpk3p induced mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger an apoptotic form of cell death  <cit> . in line with the ros accumulation result , the re-expression of tpk <dig> in Δpde2Δtpk <dig> was sufficient to restore the highly fragmented mitochondrial appearance observed in Δpde <dig> cells.

to confirm that the kinase activity of tpk3p is responsible for the respiratory and morphological defects observed in dpde <dig> cells when camp levels are elevated we generated a kinase dead version of the enzyme. deminoff et al  demonstrated that the mutagenesis of residues k <dig> and h <dig> to alanine in the yeast pka, tpk1p produced a protein lacking kinase activity. as the catalytic domain of tpk <dig> and tpk <dig> are highly conserved, we mutagenised the equivalent k <dig> and h <dig> residues of tpk3p to alanine. in line with these mutations rendering tpk3p inactive, the expression of tpk3kd in dpde2dtpk <dig> cells did not lead to the collapse of respiration  or to the manifestation of a highly fragmented mitochondrial network . these data further suggest that elevated kinase activity of tpk3p is sufficient to induce respiratory collapse and ros production in yeast mitochondria.

camp/tpk3p signalling regulates cell death in yeast colonies
it has recently emerged that regulated cell death is employed within yeast colonies to facilitate multi-cellular communication and simple differentiation  <cit> . we therefore assessed the effects of tpk3p activity on the patterning of cell death within colonies. we grew colonies for five days on ypd medium supplemented with  <dig> mm camp and the cell death indicator phloxine b, which accumulates within dead or dying cells  <cit> . wild type cells of this background display an accumulation of phloxine b within the centre of the colony, which is most visible in the dissected cross section view presented in figure  <dig>  colonies grown from cells lacking pde <dig> were smaller, disordered and accumulated phloxine b throughout the colony, indicating widespread death. small regions of phloxine b exclusion were apparent at the very growing edge of the colony. the deletion of tpk <dig> in Δpde <dig> cells resulted in a restoration of colony size and a central staining pattern that was slightly enlarged when compared to wild type but which represented a significant rescue of the camp induced colony death phenotype observed in single mutant Δpde <dig> colonies. these data suggest that camp/pka signaling regulation of cell death plays a significant role in yeast colony patterning.

microarray analysis of changes in gene expression mediated by tpk3p activity
our data indicate that elevated levels of tpk3p activity have a profound effect on the respiratory capacity and function of yeast mitochondria. in an attempt to identify the regulatory mechanisms involved we conducted a microarray experiment. single mutant Δpde <dig> and double mutant Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> strains were grown to diauxic shift in the presence of  <dig> mm camp, and mrna levels analysed as described in materials and methods. comparison of the data sets obtained allowed us to assess the impact of tpk3p activity on transcriptional regulation. two natural internal controls within the microarray data, namely the deletion of pde <dig> and tpk <dig> in the single and double mutants compared to the wild type, allowed us to confirm the reliability of the data obtained. expression of pde <dig> in both the single and double mutant was  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively compared to the wild type; tpk <dig> expression levels were 98% in the single Δpde <dig> mutant and  <dig> % in the Δpde2Δtpk <dig> double mutant, confirming the genotype of the strains used in this study . interestingly expression levels of tpk <dig> were virtually unchanged in either mutant  whereas tpk <dig> levels were reduced to 60% of wild type levels in Δpde <dig> and 66% in the double mutant. in line with this tpk1p protein levels were also markedly reduced in Δpde <dig> cells when grown in the presence of exogenous camp . of the  <dig> transcripts screened,  <dig> were up-regulated by at least  <dig> fold and  <dig> down-regulated at least  <dig> fold when comparing Δpde <dig> and Δpde2Δtpk <dig> strains . gene ontology anaylsis, using the go-slim mapper software http://www.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/go/goslimmapper.pl, allowed allocation of these genes to intracellular compartments . we found that 41% of the down-regulated transcripts encoded mitochondrial genes. closer inspection of the down-regulated mitochondrial genes revealed a number of interesting targets that are involved directly in the mitochondrial ets . both external mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenases, nde <dig> and nde <dig>  which represent complex i in yeast, were down regulated by  <dig> and  <dig> fold respectively. similarly sdh <dig>  a component of complex ii - succinate dehydrogenase; cyt <dig> and rip <dig> complex iii subunits; cyc1-isoform- <dig> cytochrome c; cox <dig> a subunit of complex iv - cytochrome c oxidase and atp <dig> a component of atpsynthase were all down regulated. in addition, the expression of a number of regulatory components of the ets was also reduced, including coq <dig>  which is required for ubiquinone biosynthesis; cyt <dig>  an enzyme required for cytochrome c maturation; cox <dig> and sco <dig>  both required for cytochrome c oxidase formation and nca <dig> which regulates expression of the mitochondrially encoded atp synthase subunits  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition to the loss of crucial elements of the ets the microarray revealed ros detoxification enzymes  were not transcriptionally up-regulated despite the increase in ros .

selected genes involved in ets and ros detoxification that were downregulated in Δpde <dig> cells but not in Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> when grown in the presence of exogenous  <dig> mm camp. gene lists were obtained as a ratio of statistically significant expression levels in Δpde2/Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> cells when grown in the presence of  <dig> mm camp.

examination of up-regulated genes did not reveal any components of the ets however genes involved in cellular respiration and mitochondrial regulation were identified . these include puf <dig>  which links mitochondria to actin cables and is important for inheritance and morphological regulation  <cit> . certain genes associated with cellular stress response were also up-regulated in a tpk3p dependent manner. for example an  <dig> fold increase in transcripts encoding the dna damage response gene hug <dig> was found. interestingly, several transporters involved in glucose uptake, hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> were also upregulated . these transporters are induced when the cell senses high glucose levels. another gene that supported the idea that nutrient sensing in terms of glucose was compromised included mig <dig> which has been shown to inhibit suc <dig> expression in the presence of high glucose levels .

genes involved in mitochondrial function, dna damage response and nutrient sensing that were upregulated in Δpde <dig> cells but not in Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> when grown in the presence of exogenous camp. gene lists were obtained as a ratio of statistically significant expression levels in Δpde2/Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> cells when grown in the presence of  <dig> mm camp.

a known feature of pka activity is the ability to suppress the activation of biosynthesis of the storage carbohydrates glycogen and trehalose. this effect was noted in our array data. several genes whose products are involved in glycogen and trehalose biosynthesis were downregulated in a tpk3p dependent manner . as a further control to verify the validity of our microarray data we investigated whether elevated tpkp <dig> activity resulted in the suppression of glycogen accumulation as cells enter the stationary phase of growth. wild type, Δpde <dig> and Δpde <dig> Δtpk <dig> cells were grown for  <dig> h and stained for glycogen accumulation as described in materials and methods. wild type cells start to accumulate glycogen at this point of growth , however we found that cells lacking pde <dig> fail to accumulate glycogen. this failure to accumulate glycogen could be reversed by the additional deletion of tpk <dig> .

the microarray data also suggested that the elevation of camp levels leds to a tpk3p dependent reduction in cox <dig> transcript levels, a core component of cytochrome c oxidase. we tested whether this observation could be re-capitulated at the protein level by conducting a western blot using wild type, Δpde <dig> and Δpde2Δtpk <dig> strains were grown to diauxic shift in the absence or presence of  <dig> mm camp. in all strains grown without the addition of exogenous camp there appeared to be similar levels of cox4p . however upon addition of camp cox4p was barely detectable in Δpde <dig> cells and a partial restoration was observed in Δpde2Δtpk <dig> cells. as cox4p is essential for complex iv stability, these data suggested that high levels of camp and tpk3p activity may lead to a loss or respiration as a result of the loss of cytochrome c oxidase from the mitochondria. in line with this the level of cox2p, which is encoded by the mitochondrial genome, was also greatly reduced upon camp elevation in Δpde <dig> cells .

camp/pka signaling regulates mitochondrial function and cell death via transcription factor activity
our microarray data suggest that elevated tpk <dig> activity leads to considerable remodeling at the level of transcription, with particular emphasis on genes involved in mitochondrial function. in an attempt to identify transcription factors involved we utilised the bioinformatics analysis package yeastract http://www.yeastract.com/ to identify potential transcription factor involvement. using this analysis software, which utilizes  <dig>  characterised associations between known transcription factors and target genes, several candidate transcription factors were selected for further analysis, these were sok <dig>  sko <dig> and hap <dig> . the collapse of respiration observed in cells lacking pde <dig>  when grown in the presence of  <dig> mm camp, was partially rescued by the deletion of either sko <dig> or sok <dig> . however in both cases a significant reduction in routine respiration rate was observed in response to camp addition. in contrast, although exhibiting a low starting routine rate of respiration, Δpde2Δhap <dig> cells did not respond to the addition of camp . in line with a partial restoration of mitochondrial function, both Δpde2Δsko <dig> and Δpde2Δsok <dig> showed a significant reduction in the number of cells accumulating high levels of ros when compared to Δpde <dig> single mutant cells . strikingly the addition of camp to Δpde2Δhap <dig> did not induce significant ros production . we also examined the effects of camp elevation on cell death in colonies in these strains . we found that the loss of sko <dig> or sok <dig> in a Δpde <dig> background renders cells partially unresponsive to camp addition, resulting in increased colony size and reduced cell death as assessed by phloxine b uptake . cells lacking both pde <dig> and hap <dig> appeared to be resistant to camp exposure and did not exhibit signs of widespread cell death .

hap <dig> activity leads to the camp/pka dependent biogenesis of dysfunctional mitochondria prone to ros production
our data points to a mechanism whereby camp induced ros production and cell death occurs as a result of the modulation of multiple transcription factor activity. however the activity of hap <dig> would appear to be of particular importance. it has been demonstrated that the hap <dig> gene product is involved in stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and elevating respiration during glucose de-repression, by enhancing the transcriptional activity of the hap2/3/4/ <dig> complex  <cit> . we therefore investigated the effects of hap <dig> overexpression on mitochondrial function in wild type and Δpde <dig> cells grown in the presence of camp. to do this we overexpressed hap <dig> from plasmids that utilized either an endogenous promoter or repressible tetracycline, tet o, promoter. both of these plasmids were able to fully restore the inability of a hap <dig> deletion strain to grow on the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol, indicating that both could restore mitochondrial function . initially we examined the ability of hap <dig> overexpression to suppress the mitochondrial morphology defects associated with high pka activity. as both plasmids yielded exactly the same results we present data for a single hap <dig> expressing plasmid, that utilizing the tet o promoter . mitochondria in cells lacking pde2p develop fragmented and swollen mitochondria that fail to respire when grown in the presence of camp . the overexpression of hap <dig> was found to partially restore mitochondrial morphology to Δpde <dig> cells, in that a tubular array could be observed. however this network was never observed to be as elaborate as that seen in wild type cells . the overexpression of hap <dig> in Δpde <dig> cells was also able to increase the expression of nuclear  and mitochondrial encoded  components of the cytochrome c oxidase complex  of the electron transport chain . this indicates that expression of hap <dig> is able to promote mitochondrial biogenesis in Δpde <dig> cells grown in the presence of camp. however the overexpression of hap <dig> was insufficient to improve the poor oxygen consumption level observed in Δpde <dig> cells when treated with camp . in addition, only a small reduction in the number of cells accumulating ros could be observed when comparing Δpde <dig> cell grown in the presence of camp in the presence or absence of the hap <dig> overexpression construct . it should be noted that the overexpression of hap <dig> in wild type cells also resulted in a significant reduction in oxygen consumption  and an increase in the number or ros positive cells . these results suggest that although increased expression of hap <dig> can lead to an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, it does not by itself lead to the production of healthy and fully functional organelles.

discussion
the activity of camp/pka signalling pathways appears to play an important role in the regulation of cell death in eukaryotes. for example it has been shown in lymphoid cells that elevated camp/pka levels cause transcriptional changes that promote mitochondrial dependent apoptosis  <cit>  andcan induce apoptosis via the up-regulation of smac/diablo in cultured hela cells  <cit> . our previous studies suggest that in yeast excessive pka activity can also trigger, albeit via distinct signalling mechanisms to those observed to date in mammalian systems, mitochondria dependent apoptosis  <cit> . in yeast camp/pka stimulated apoptosis involves the production of ros from mitochondria. the mitochondrial state that leads to ros production in actin aggregating cells requires pka activity, and in particular the function of one of the three pka subunits found in s. cerevisiae, tpk3p  <cit> . our data presented here supports a role for pka signalling in regulating the activity of mitochondria via transcriptional control. in support of this our microarray analysis of the effects of camp elevation revealed a tpk3p dependent suppression of a significant number of genes involved in mitochondrial function. of particular note were genes whose products contribute to the electron transport system. the tpk3p dependent downregulation of genes required for respiration also resulted in a significant reduction in respiratory capacity. both the regulation of transcription and respiration could be restored by deletion of tpk <dig>  implicating this single enzyme as an important regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. another possibility that must be considered is that tpk3p localises to the mitochondria and regulates function directly via phosphorylation of protein targets. pka activity within the mitochondria has been widely reported in mammalian systems and is known to modulate the activity of the respiratory chain  <cit> . interestingly a fully functional carbon dioxide sensing camp/pka signalling system has recently been identified within human hela and cos- <dig> cell lines  <cit> . in yeast, the mitochondrial histone-like protein abf <dig> has been shown to be phosphorylated by pka, suggesting that activity of camp dependent phosphorylation also occurs within mitochondria of lower eukaryotes  <cit> . phosphorylation of abf2p by pka was shown to inhibit its ability to interact with dna, and the loss of abf <dig> resulted in mtdna instability  <cit> . however fluorescence microscopy studies suggest that tpk1p, tpk2p and tpk3p do not co-localise with the mitochondria . in addition to this, the published mitochondrial proteome from s. cerevisae, despite identifying a number of protein kinases within the organelle, did not reveal the presence of pka enzymes  <cit> . further studies are required to fully address whether, as is the case in mammalian cells, camp/pka signalling occurs within yeast mitochondria.

further evidence that camp/tpk <dig> signalling regulates mitochondrial biogenesis at the level of transcription comes from our finding that respiratory function, ros production and cell death can be manipulated by rescued to varying degrees by the transcription factors sok <dig>  sko <dig> and hap <dig>  which were predicted to play a role via bioinformatic analysis of our microarray data. both sok <dig> and sko <dig> are transcription factors that have been previously implicated in camp signalling systems, and act as suppressor elements within stress signalling pathways. sok <dig> is known to be regulated by camp/pka activity  <cit>  and to play an important role in the regulation of cell death in colonies in response to ammonia signalling  <cit> . sko <dig> is a repressor that mediates hog pathway-dependent regulation by binding to camp response elements  sites in target promoters  <cit> . it is also known to play a regulatory role within camp/pka stress signalling and can be phosphorylated by both hog <dig> and pka at independent sites  <cit> . it is likely that some of the toxicity associated with elevated camp/pka activity occurs as a result of increased stress response suppression via the activity of sok <dig> and sko <dig>  in line with this, the deletion of either sok <dig> or sko <dig> led to a partial restoration of respiratory activity and reduction in ros production in Δpde <dig> cells grown in the presence of camp.

more significantly, the deletion of hap <dig>  a known mitochondrial biogenesis factor  <cit> , prevented ros production and cell death in Δpde <dig> cells grown in the presence of camp. this suggests that the activity of hap <dig> present within cells experiencing high camp/pka signalling is responsible for the production of ros. the overexpression of hap <dig> led to the partial restoration of mitochondrial biogenesis in Δpde <dig> cells grown under conditions of camp elevation. however the additional mitochondria produced were not competent to respire and continued to produce high levels of ros. we found that the overexpression of hap <dig> in wild type cells also gave rise to mitochondria with reduced respiratory capacity, which were prone to ros production. these data suggest that as yet unidentified factors aside from hap <dig> are required to ensure the biogenesis of fully functional mitochondria. as the loss of tpk <dig> led to the restoration of fully functional mitochondria in Δpde <dig> cells grown under conditions of camp elevation it is likely that pka function regulates mitochondrial activity via more than one effector to co-ordinate biogenesis in response to environmental change and metabolic demand. the search for further downstream targets of tpk3p that are involved in mitochondrial regulation and biogenesis is currently underway. elevation of tpk3p activity also led to striking morphological defects, with mitochondria appearing fewer in number and as larger swollen structures. these mitochondria also exhibited reduced membrane potential and a reduction in respiratory chain components. very similar features were reported to occur in mutants lacking mdm38p and were attributed to the role that this protein plays in k+/h+ exchange  <cit>  raising the possibility that elevated tpk3p induces a loss of homeostasis within the organelle.

our observations suggest that elevated tpkp <dig> activity induces a novel mitochondrial state that results in non-respiring mitochondria prone to the production of ros. a key question arising from this research is therefore, why do mitochondria damaged by elevated tpk3p activity produce ros? interestingly a previous study has proposed that constitutive activation of the ras pathway, via expression of the rasval <dig> allele, leads to a state  <dig> non-phosphorylating respiration that is prone to ros production  <cit> . this study also suggested that the respiratory activity and mitochondrial membrane potential of rasval <dig> cells becomes elevated, offering a plausible explanation as to the origin of ros  <cit> . however in actin aggregating cells, which also exhibit constitutive ras activation, and in Δpde <dig> cells grown in the presence of  <dig> mm camp, there exists little or no mitochondrial membrane potential  <cit> . this was confirmed by treatment of cells with fccp, a proton ionophore, that allows protons to flow back through the inner mitochondrial membrane into the matrix. this releases the inhibition caused by the build up of a proton gradient and allows the electron transport system to operate at its maximal rate . in cells with functional mitochondria, fccp treatment normally results in an increase in oxygen consumption of around 30-40% . however cells lacking pde <dig> failed to respond to fccp when grown in the presence of exogenous camp. this supports our suggestion that elevated tpk3p activity results in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. we would argue that the constitutive activation of ras/camp/pka signalling can lead to altered mitochondrial function prone to ros function that does not occur as a result of state  <dig> respiration.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study has revealed that the loss of regulation of camp/pka signalling leads to cell death that requires tpk <dig> dependent transcriptional remodelling that suppresses stress response signalling and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction. tpk3p appears to facilitate cell death via action on several downstream targets, notably hap <dig>  which induce the formation of dysfunctional mitochondria which fail to respire and produce high levels of ros. the loss of respiratory capacity within mitochondria has been associated with a wide range of human disorders including stroke, cardioencephalomyopathy, hepatic failure and leigh's syndrome  <cit>  and is also associated with aging and aging-related degenerative diseases such as alzheimer's  <cit> . we hypothesise that the increased production of respiratory incompetent mitochondria that are prone to ros production may contribute to the pathology of a variety of age related disease states. further research in this area utilising yeast as a model eukaryote may well provide insights of important medical relevance.
