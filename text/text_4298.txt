BACKGROUND
human epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig>  is one of the tyrosine kinase receptors in egfr family, which includes egfr/erbb <dig>  her2/erbb <dig>  her3/erbb <dig> and her4/erbb <dig>  <cit> . since there is no natural ligand specific to her <dig>  her <dig> tends to form heterodimer with other ligand-induced members  <cit> . after dimerization, the complex can trigger downstream pathways such as ras/raf/mapk and pi3k/akt pathways to increase cell growth, cell survival and cell differentiation  <cit> . considerable evidencesshowed that her <dig> over expression was involved in many types of cancer such as breast, ovarian, gastric and prostate cancers  <cit> . therefore, her <dig> is considered as a drug target for cancer therapy focusing on inhibiting her <dig> to reduce tumor growth.

at present, there are two main approaches used to inhibit her <dig>  namely; monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab, and small molecule inhibitors such as lapatinib  <cit>  and syr <dig>   <cit>  targetingon tyrosine kinase domain . although trastuzumab can downregulate her expression, cardiotoxicity and drug resistance can be found in trastuzumab-treated patients  <cit> . moreover, side effects such as diarrhea, rash or nausea can be observed in lapatinib treatment  <cit> . hence, new inhibitors are urgently required for her2-overexpressed cancer treatment.

recently, in  <dig>  the first her2-tk structure complex with pyrimidine compound syr was released , providing the new understanding of the kinase structure  <cit> . unlike the active- or inactive-conformations of egfr-tk, her2-tk configuration was somewhat in the middle of these typical conformations. it was named “the active-like conformation”, due to, the orientation of the helix-αc-out, the dfg-in and unformed secondary structure of the activation loop. the second crystal of her2-tk complex with tak- <dig>  adopted the similar conformation as mentioned above  <cit> .

curcumin  is generally found as the major compound in rhizomes of turmeric plants; curcuma longa linaeusas yellow residue. it has been used as spice and ingredients in folk medicinal remedies in many asian countries. the curcumin and its three natural analogs, curcumin ii , curcumin iii  and cyclocurcuminpossess the remarkable pharmacological effects for centuries, such as anti-inflammatory  <cit> , antioxidant  <cit> , anti-carcinogenesis . moreover, curcumins is safe to use in high dose with non-toxic report  <cit> . despite many advantages of curcumins, the poor stability and bioavailability profiles of curcumins are questionable when it comes to directly using crude curcumin as the potent and selective cancer drug. many researchers have been focusing on the developing the curcumin analogs to enhance their stability and bioavailability. in particular, the novel series of curcumin-analog compounds have been synthesized and studied their effect in various cell targets . they possess several properties, potent activity against parasite in trypanosoma and leishmania species  <cit> , antimycobacterial activity  <cit> , inhibiting nitric oxide production from lps-activated microglial cells  <cit>  and estrogenic properties  <cit> . thus, in this paper, we aimed to investigate the effect of this set of curcumin analogs on the her2-tk activity using both experimental and computational methods.

curcumin has been shown to inhibit cancer growth by means of inhibiting several tyrosine kinases including egfr, her <dig>  mapk, phosphorylase kinase, pp60c-src tyrosine kinase, protein kinase c, and protein kinase a . furthermore, the curcumins can inhibit various types of cancer including breast cancer cells  <cit>  and also induce the internalization of her <dig> from cell surface  <cit> . recently, curcumin analog cyclohexanone has shown to selectively inhibit tyrosine kinase domain of egfr, in vitro, in vivo and in silico studies  <cit>  which reveals an opportunity for direct binding between curcumins and tyrosine kinase domains of other egfr family members. furthermore, the in silico screening of the natural database against her <dig> kinase showed that such curcumins could interact with kinase through benzene rings for hydrophobic interactions and carboxyl groups for hydrogen bond formation  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated interactions between curcumin analogs and her2-tk by using virtual screening based on molecular docking in order to find potential compounds against her2-tk. the hit compounds have been validated by different inhibitions between two types of breast cancer cell-lines with both her2-overexpression and her2-non-overexpression. such findings might be useful for further development of curcumins as a new her <dig> inhibitor in the future.

methods
computational procedures
the preparation of ligand
the two dimensional  structure of  <dig> curcuminoid analogs were collected from the previous studies  . the ionization states, tautomers, stereochemistries, and ring conformations of all curcuminoid structures were calculated and opls- <dig> force field was applied using ligprep module in schrödinger package. these structures were used as an initial material during computational docking procedure to study interactions with the binding site of the her <dig> tyrosine kinase domain.

the preparation of protein
the atomic coordinate of her <dig> tyrosine kinase domain  was obtained from the crystallographic structure, accession no. 3pp <dig> in protein data bank   <cit> . this structure contains asymmetric dimer of her2-tk complex with selective inhibitor her2-tk, pyrrolopyrimidine-based potent, syr. in order to perform the docking calculations, only chain a was selected as the target template. another chain of her2-tk as well as the co-crystalized ligand and crystal water molecules were removed. hydrogen atoms were assigned and parameterized with optimized potential for liquid simulation version  <dig>  using the protein preparation wizard, which continuously minimized the whole structure by the impref module in the schrödinger package.

docking procedure using glide standard precision mode 
the structures of protein and ligands were prepared as previously described. the opls- <dig> force field was applied to both protein and ligands. the complexes of her2-tk and each curcuminoid, including the co-crystal ligand were generated with molecular docking approach using grid-based ligand docking with energetics with standard precision mode   <cit> . the grid map was generated in receptor grid generation by setting the center of the grid map around the catalytic site. self-docking between her2-tk and syr was performed to validate all parameters before being applied to the study of interactions between her <dig> and curcumins.

post-docking analysis
in order to handle considerable number of docking results, the sub-groups of modified core structure of curcuminoids were classified. top ranks docking score of each sub-group were selected to further test in cell-based assay. in addition, the poor scores of each curcumin sub-groups were also chosen to be the control set in breast cancer cell-line assay.

molecular interaction and stability in binding pocket
all simulation steps were performed using the sander module of the amber  <dig> package and amber ff <dig> force-field parameters  <cit> . the partial atomic charges of ligand were computed by using am1-bcc method as implemented in the antechamber module of the amber package. their atom types and missing force field parameters were assigned based on the general amber force field . each complex was immersed in an isomeric truncated-octahedron box of tip3p water molecules  and neutralized by additional cl- anions. the system was then minimized with the five-step procedure . all steps included  <dig>  steepest-descent minimization cycles and  <dig>  conjugate-gradient minimization cycles with different restraints on the protein structure. for the first step, harmonic restraints with a force constant of  <dig> kcal/ were used to immobilize the heavy atoms of protein coordinates, excluding hydrogen atoms, at the starting positions, while solvent molecules were allowed to relax the unfavorable contacts with other solvent and solute molecules. for the second, third and fourth steps, harmonic restraints with force constants of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  kcal/, respectively, were used to restrain the backbone of the protein. in the last step, the entire system was minimized with no positional restraints.

with weak positional restraints on the protein ), all systems were heated from  <dig> to  <dig> k during a  <dig> ps md simulations. after removing the restraints from the protein, we equilibrated the system with constant volume and set the constant temperature at  <dig> k for  <dig> ps. note that we observed the equilibrium of energy , temperature, pressure, volume, density and rmsd before moving on to the production runs. the production md simulations were performed from  <dig> ns while maintaining constant pressure and temperature. with a collision frequency of  <dig> ps- <dig>  the temperature in all simulations was controlled by langevin dynamics. using an isotropic position scaling algorithm with a relaxation time of  <dig> ps, the pressure in npt simulations was maintained at an average pressure of  <dig> atm. the random number generator was reseeded  <cit>  for every simulation. a cut-off of  <dig> Å and the particle mesh ewald method were employed with the default parameters to calculate long-range non bonded interactions. with the tolerance parameter of 10- <dig> Å, shake constraints  <cit>  were used to eliminate bond-stretching freedom for all bonds involving hydrogen, thereby allowing the use of a  <dig> fs time step. to monitor the stabilities of all systems, the cα root-mean-square deviations  were calculated. the rmsd of binding residues within  <dig> Å of the inhibitor were examined. the ptraj modules in the amber software were used to calculate the hydrogen bond occupancy and hydrogen bond distance between inhibitors and proteins  <cit> . all md simulations were calculated on 22-node linux high performance computer cluster with  <dig> cores of amd  <dig>  ghz.

the energy calculations were done as implemented in the mmpbsa.py script in ambertools. the mm-pbsa approach is an acceptable method to compute the free energies of binding of ligands to proteins or to estimate the absolute free energies of molecules  <cit> . one hundred frames from the last  <dig> ns of each  <dig> ns md studies were selected for the analysis of ligand binding energies, sampled at  <dig> ps intervals. binding free energy was estimated from each energy terms as following equations ,
  <dig>    <dig>    <dig>    <dig>  

‹∆gmmpbsa› is referred to final calculated mm-pbsa binding energy. it is described by the difference of Δgcomplex by the summation of Δgprotein and Δgligand . the free energy of each molecular system is given by the expression in the terms of equation . ‹∆emm› is the total molecular mechanics energy in the gas phase, ‹∆gsolv› is a correction term  of each system surrounded by solvent, and ‹t∆s› is the entropy. ‹∆emm› includes electrostatic ‹∆eele›, and van der waals ‹∆evdw› energies, while ‹∆gsolv› is the sum of electrostatic solvation energy ‹∆gpb›, and the non-electrostatic solvation component ‹∆gnp› . the polar contribution is calculated using pb model, while the non-polar energy is estimated by solvent accessible surface area . in this study, ‹t∆s› term was excluded.

experimental procedures
proliferation and viability assay
cell proliferation and viability were measured by tetrazolium 3-- <dig>  5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide  assay. the reaction was catalyzed by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenease and requires nadh, which must be supplied by living cells. skbr <dig> and mcf <dig> cell line were seeded in flat-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates as  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well/ <dig> μl and cultured overnight. pure curcumin extracts and its analogs with different concentrations were dissolved in  <dig> μl 10% fbs-rpmi  <dig> medium and added into the cells and incubated for  <dig> h. then  <dig> μl of medium was removed and  <dig> μl of mtt dye  was added, followed by 4hourof incubation. subsequently, the supernatant from each well was aspirated off, leaving the purple form azan crystals. optical density was measured by an elisa micro plate reader at  <dig> nm with a reference wavelength of  <dig> nm. percentage of cell survival was calculated by the formula below. each assay was done in triplicate and the standard deviations were calculated.

RESULTS
selection of the curcumin analogs and structure analyses
considering to the core structures of all  <dig> curcuminoid compounds, the middle-linear seven carbon linkage between two phenyl rings can be classified into four sub-groups,β-diketone, monoketone, pyrazole , and isoxazole . schematic diagram of the workflow is shown in figure  <dig>  all  <dig> curcumin analogs were docked against tyrosine kinase of her <dig> by glide sp docking. a few compounds of each sub-group in the docking top ranks were selected. all  <dig> chosen compounds were classified into four groups based on their core structures. from table  <dig>  compounds as-ktc <dig> to as-ktc <dig> were classified into β-diketone group. monoketone composed of two compounds, as-ktc <dig> and as-ktc <dig>  for as-ktc <dig> to as-ktc <dig> were categorized as pyrazole curcumin analogs. the last group, isoxazole curcumin analogs consisted of seven molecules, as-ktc <dig> to as-ktc <dig>  the docked conformations of all curcumin compounds were well oriented in the atp-binding pocket of her2-tk . one phenyl-end of curcuminoids compounds oriented well in deep hydrophobic pocket, while another phenyl-end exposed to the open gate. they could form interactions either with met <dig>  or with cys <dig> , depending on each configuration of analog . according to the revealed three dimensional structure of her2-tk adopted the active-like conformation, the binding cave stayed in the tunnel shape rather than the opened cave as presented in egfr-tk. this pocket possesses approximately the volume of  <dig> Å <dig>  as the binding pocket adopted the tunnel-like shape, the curcuminoid structures are also in the linear cylinder shape that can fit into this pocket quite well. the hydrophobic-i site merged with the phosphate binding region  as the deep semi-closed site of atp-binding pocket. this pocket is occupied by the trifluoromethyl-phenoxy fragment of syr, the co-crystal ligand . furthermore, one of the phenyl rings and its hydrophobic substituent groups of curcuminoids compounds were perfectly fit to this deep hydrophobic pocket. the functional groups of modified middle-linear seven carbon linkage of curcurmin analogs pointed to the dfg motif, especially the adjacent residue thr <dig>  in addition, another phenyl-end and its hydrophobic substituent groups of curcumin analogs could span around adenine region to hydrophobic-ii site . this observation was found as the common interaction among curcuminoid compounds, conformed to the pyridine and amine fragments of syr pointed to the same residues . these occupancy and interactions were considered important to increase selectivity and affinity for her <dig> inhibitors . however, the curcumin analogs could not interact with met <dig> as any other egfr/her2-tk inhibitors, which contain 4-anilinoquinazoline, pyrrolopyrimidine, pyrrolotriazine and cyanoquinoline cores. the carbonyl group of the linkage chain, from β-diketone or monoketoncurcumins, could form a hydrogen bond directly with one of the key residues thr <dig> . this interaction differed from that of syr <dig> and other her <dig> inhibitors that was a water-mediated hydrogen bond between n <dig> of quinazoline and thr <dig>  <cit> . as the direct hydrogen bond formation at this position was crucial to enhance binding affinity, n <dig> of quinazoline was modified to nitrile group to form the direct hydrogen bond  <cit> . these occupancy and interactions mimicked those of a heterocyclic core of her <dig> inhibitor in an adenine ring of atp  <cit> . all  <dig> selected compounds have been processed in further experiments, to investigate the bioavailability profiles of curcumin analogs on two types of human breast cancer cell lines.figure  <dig>

the bioavailability profiles of curcumin analogs on two types of human breast cancer cell lines
the her2-tk inhibitory assay was performed using a commercialized her2-tk, but unfortunately, activity of the her2-tk could not be detected . moreover curcumins were stable and soluble in very low ph which is not suitable for her2-tk to stay active. therefore, the cell-based assay was chosen instead of the purified protein based assay to investigate the inhibitory effect of curcumin analogs to her2-tk. in order to identify the curcumin analogs against her2-tk, two different types of human breast cancer cell lines, mcf- <dig> and skbr <dig> were performed. the skbr <dig> is a breast cancer cell line which over-expresses the her <dig> gene product while the mcf- <dig> is in absence of her <dig> protein overexpression . therefore, such compounds should be more effective against skbr <dig> than mcf- <dig>  the lapatinib which was tested on both breast cancer cell lines showed the ic <dig> on skbr <dig> lower than mcf- <dig>  <cit> . twenty-four selected compounds were determined ic <dig> on both breast cancer cell lines by mtt assay as shown in table  <dig>  although most of curcumin analogs have very similar structures, each analog showed different activities on both cells. in the β-diketone group from table  <dig>  only as-ktc <dig> showed the effective inhibiting to her2-positive cancer cell-line , vice versa, lack of inhibiting to her2-negative cancer cell-line . the core structure of this group composes of β-diketone which is modified substituent from natural curcumins. on the other hand none of curcumin analogs in monoketone and pyrazole groups showed selectively inhibiting activity among both cancer cell-lines. in the last group, as-ktc <dig> also presented the outstanding suppress on skbr <dig> but not mcf <dig> among isoxazole analogs. the ic <dig> for as-ktc <dig> and as-ktc <dig> in skbr <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively, and ic <dig> for both compounds in mcf <dig> were higher than  <dig> μm. since both as-ktc <dig> and as-ktc <dig> were selected from docking results, they could inhibit the breast cancer cells through blocking of her2-tk activities. therefore, the as-ktc <dig> and as-ktc <dig> were chosen for further investigation the interaction mechanisms by molecular dynamics simulations.table  <dig>

molecular interaction, stability binding free energy via mm-pbsa
the molecular dynamics  simulations were performed to examine the molecular interaction of the bothas-ktc <dig> and as-ktc <dig> curcuminoids in the atp-binding pocket of her2-tk. as mention in the previous section, the x-ray crystal structure of her2-tk, 3pp <dig> has been used as the model reference template of this study. the complexes of her2-tk-as-ktc <dig> and her2-tk-as-ktc <dig> which were constructed using molecular docking procedure have been used as starting coordinates for md calculations. the root mean square deviations  of all systems  seemed to fit nicely in the binding pocket of her2-tk . the structure of curcuminoid distinguishes from other known tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which generally containing either quinazoline or pyrrolopyrimidine based structures  <cit> . the structures of curcumin analogs adopted the long thread with two knots at each end, resulting in freely flexible structure in the tunnel-like binding pocket. interestingly, the md results revealed that the hydrogen bonds between h-n atom of met <dig>  and n-atom at position n <dig> of syr existed about  <dig> % along the entire  <dig> ns of simulation time. on the other hand, the curcumin analogs possess the interesting hydrogen bond pairs in both as-ktc <dig> and as-ktc <dig>  rather than forming hydrogen bond with met <dig>  the β-diketone curcumin analog  formed hydrogen bonds to thr <dig>  cys <dig> and asp <dig>  in the binding pocket of her2-tk. the formation with these three amino acids existed approximately  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively along the entire md simulations . distances chromatograms of each pairwise atom from h-bond analyses were shown in figure  <dig>  one of these three residues is dfg-motif , and another is adjacent residue of dfg-motif . for as-ktc <dig> , the hydrogen boding with cys <dig> and thr <dig> existed about  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, along the entire md simulations. as illustrated in figure 2c and 2d, one of the phenyl-end of curcumin compounds were well oriented in the atp-binding pocket of her2-tk, while the other-end exposed to solvent giving a chance to interact with cys <dig>  while the linker in the middle of cucurmin structure could interact with thr <dig>  the binding residues of syr-her2-tk systems appear to be stable along the md simulations . the system started to converge since  <dig> ns of simulations time . in addition, the simulation systems of as-ktc006-her2tk and as-ktc021-her2tk seem to converge after  <dig> ns of simulations time . from the molecular dynamic results suggested that as-ktc <dig> had better binding affinity with her2-tk than that of as-ktc <dig>  considering at the curcuminoids structures, as-ktc <dig> is more flexible than as-ktc <dig>  in particular, as-ktc <dig> possesses β-diketonemoiety on both sides providing the flexibility of the molecule and allowing o-atom of ketone to interact with thr <dig>  the binding energy calculations were performed to further understand the interactions of each system. it is to be noted that protein–ligand entropy contributions were not included in these free energy values since the present mm-pbsa are typically time consuming and unreliable. considering the intermolecular interaction of the ligands with her2-tk in contribution terms , non-polar contributions, the summation of Δevdw and Δgnp, are significant with all ligand-her2tk systems. interestingly, ligand as-ktc <dig> shows the most favorable electrostatic interaction with the binding pocket of her2tk. there are the agreement between mm-pbsa binding energy calculations, docking and md simulations. the consistent observations were presented in all three different computational approaches, namely, focusing on o-atom of ketone to interact with thr <dig> of the system as-ktc006-her2tk complex. recently, the computational model of anti-her <dig> ligands, the analogous of 4-anilinoquinazoline were reported  <cit> . these works showed that the vdw term could be a major factor of the ligand-protein interactions; hence, the deep hydrophobic pocket would be the selectivity pocket of her2-tk  <cit> . rather than focusing on the 4-anilinoquinazoline core structure , we focused on the curcuminoid core structure in this study. both selected curcumin analogs form the distinguish interaction moiety from the known inhibitors of her2-tk. furthermore, they occupied well in the deep hydrophobic pocket of her2-tk.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we screened a series of curcumin compounds using a computational molecular docking. then, the bioavailability assay of curcumin analogs, were conducted on two types of human breast cancer cell lines to select the specific active her <dig> kinase inhibitors. the results suggested that bisdemethylcurcumin compound  and  <dig> -bis- <dig> -dimethoxystyryl)isoxazole  could inhibit breast cancer cell lines though her2-tk. in addition, the intermolecular studies from md simulation suggested that both selected curcumin analogs form the distinguish interaction moiety from the known inhibitors of her2-tk. mm-pbsa binding calculation suggested that non-polar contributions are not only significant with all ligand-her2tk systems but also a major factor of the ligand-protein interactions.
