BACKGROUND
genome-scale models  are the collection of gene to protein to reaction associations , charge and elementally balanced reactions, and constraints on molecular functions found within a cell  <cit> . the constraints placed on molecular function define the possible phenotypes of an organism under specific conditions  <cit> . there are a number of applications for gsms beyond the prediction of wildtype phenotypes in varying environments. these include the identification of optimal gene and medium modifications, non-native routes for metabolite production, and lethal gene deletions  <cit> . a genome-scale model of cyanothece atcc  <dig>  icyt <dig>  was recently published  <cit> . it contains four compartments, with  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> charge and elementally balanced reactions. icyt <dig> is an improvement upon the previously published icce <dig> model  <cit> , and contains  <dig> genes and  <dig> reactions unique from icce <dig>  <cit> . further comparison of the two models can be found in the work by saha et al.  <cit> . icyt <dig> also models the diurnal rhythm of the cyanothece metabolism. since cyanothece atcc  <dig> is closely related to all five cyanothece species discussed in this paper  <cit> , it was used in the development of the reconstructions for five organisms, cyanothece pcc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  as icyc <dig>  icyn <dig>  icyj <dig>  icyp <dig>  and icyh <dig> respectively . all models were named using their associated kegg organism code. the objective of this study is to expediently generate models for a collection of members of a genus, using as a foundation an existing high-quality metabolic model for a representative member of the genus, while integrating information from a range of available sources.

the genus cyanothece belongs to the phylum of cyanobacteria. cyanobacteria have a number of properties that make them ideal candidates for bio-production. photosynthetic cyanobacteria bypass the need for sugar carbon substrates while having higher solar energy conversion efficiencies  than c <dig>  and c <dig> plants   <cit> . cyanothece generate not only hydrogen  <cit>  but also fix atmospheric nitrogen by temporally segregating the photosynthesis and nitrogenase activities  <cit> . in addition, cyanothece possess the potential to grow in air and can be easily fixed to solid matrices  <cit> . all five species discussed in this paper are capable of fixing nitrogen and producing hydrogen, while cyanothece pcc  <dig> is the only species that is not capable of accomplishing this task in an aerobic environment  <cit> .  <dig> also varies in a number of physical characteristics, enough so that it has been suggested that it should be reclassified to another genus pending further review  <cit> .

cyanothece pcc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were all sequenced following the promising discoveries made concerning the metabolic capabilities of cyanothece atcc  <dig>  <cit> . these five species exhibit unique metabolic characteristics that motivated the development of five separate reconstructions. fragments of a butanol producing pathway have been postulated to exist in all strains through an inspection of the cyanothece genomes  <cit> . metabolic capabilities such as the alkane biosynthetic pathway and alternative pathways for breaking down arginine across species  <cit>  have been hypothesized to exist as well. given differences in metabolism, developed genetic systems  <cit> , and variations in growth characteristics, phenotype, and rhythms of nitrogen fixation and respiration  <cit> , it is important to globally assess the metabolic repertoire of each strain separately.

there exist numerous databases devoted to gene annotations for a wide variety of organisms  <cit> . however, the number of gene annotations is skewed towards a handful of extensively studied organisms. escherichia coli k- <dig>  the strain modeled in the iaf <dig> metabolic reconstruction  <cit> , has approximately  <dig> times the number of reviewed annotations  in the universal protein resource  compared to cyanothece pcc  <dig>   <cit> . for most  organisms uniprot contains only a small subset of required gene annotations . faced with this paucity of organism-specific gene annotation information, most metabolic reconstructions rely on a single database  from which to pull gene annotations  <cit> . this may introduce errors in the reconstruction as absent functionalities could be included in the model due to permissive homology cutoffs or errors in the original annotation source. in addition, specific and non-specific references to the same metabolite  and generic or unbalanced reactions  <cit>  may also affect the consistency of the reconstruction. integrating and contrasting information from multiple databases can remedy many of these shortcomings.

a systematic workflow is put forth that addresses the aforementioned challenges. it allows for the parallel reconstruction of genome-scale models for organisms that have a sequenced genome and are closely related to a species with a curated genome-scale model. using this workflow, reconstructions were developed for all five cyanothece species using icyt <dig> and reviewed annotations from uniprot  <cit> , ncbi protein clusters  <cit> , and the rapid annotations using subsystems technology  method  <cit> . these annotations were used to retrieve charge and elementally balanced reactions from both the icyt <dig> model and the seed database  <cit>  for the construction of draft models. no reconciliation between the icyt <dig> and seed reactions or metabolites was required as icyt <dig> was initially constructed using seed notation when possible. the five models are all capable of producing biomass using the icyt <dig> biomass equations under diverse nutrient conditions. all five models are free of thermodynamically infeasible cycles, and the fractions of reactions mapped to specific genes  are within the range of manually curated reconstructions. the use of multiple annotation sources helps to mitigate errors that may arise from a single source. unlike automated draft models , organism-specific metabolites such as pigments are included in the biomass equation and light reactions are fully traced. this workflow is also more adept at excluding metabolites present in related species but absent in the reconstructed organism. for example, menaquinone and ubiquinone are known to not exist within cyanothece <cit> , but are often pulled into draft models generated by automated software.

RESULTS
model comparisons
the five models were developed by combining reactions from the curated metabolic model, icyt <dig>  with reactions taken from the seed database whose presence in that organism were confirmed by reviewed annotations. the statistics for the five developed models are shown in table  <dig> . the model development workflow identified reactions that are in some cases unique to each reconstruction. however, closely related cyanothece  <dig> and  <dig> have no unique reactions though they do contain a set of  <dig> reactions that are not found in any other reconstruction. all five models contain four compartments: cytosol, periplasm, thylakoid lumen, and carboxysome. the number of genes present in each reconstruction is similar to the number of open reading frames  associated with the icyt <dig> and isyn <dig> models. the percentage of non-exchange reactions without associated genes falls within ranges comparable to those of numerous manually curated models   <cit> . biomass yields were also calculated for each of the five models using the same photoautotrophic conditions used to calculate the biomass yield for icyt <dig>  <cit> . all five models had an identical yield of  <dig>  mole biomass/mole carbon fixed.

figure  <dig> shows the number of reactions shared between icyt <dig> and each one of the models. a total of  <dig> reactions from icyt <dig> are shared with at least one of the five models while  <dig> reactions have been added to all five models during the seed reaction retrieval step of the workflow. the removal of these  <dig> reactions only affects biomass production in icyn <dig>  it does not grow when the reactions are removed since one of the reactions is essential as it is the only fe oxidoreductase present within icyn <dig>  the other four models contain another fe oxidoreductase. the number of reactions shared between each of the five models and icyt <dig>  generally matches the phylogenetic relationships between the organisms  <cit> . cyanothece  <dig>  which is the farthest removed of the five species from cyanothece  <dig>  also has the fewest identified homologs with cyanothece  <dig>  the two most closely related pairs, cyanothece 7424/ <dig> and 8801/ <dig>  have the highest reaction similarities  while the farthest removed species, cyanothece  <dig>  has the lowest similarity. this divergence lends support to the possibility of reclassification  <cit> .

model validation using published findings
the effect of a gene knockout on an organism’s phenotype is frequently used in assessing gsm quality  <cit> . however, unlike the cyanomutants database for synechocystis pcc  <dig>  <cit> , none of the five species have a detailed repository of known mutants. the Δnifk mutant for cyanothece  <dig> was shown to not be able to grow without the presence of combined nitrogen   <cit> . this finding implies the critical involvement of nifk in the fixation of nitrogen. in icyj <dig> this gene is involved in the gpr of the nitrogen fixation reaction present within the model. given that the gpr describes nifk as one of three critical subunits of the enzyme, its deletion results in the inability for that reaction to carry flux. upon its removal from icyj <dig>  the model is unable to grow without the addition of nitrate or ammonium, showing that the model reacts to the knockout in the same manner as the organism does in vivo.

despite the many similarities between the five species, significant differences also exist  <cit> . genes that code for isocitrate lyase and malate synthase  are present only in cyanothece  <dig> and  <dig> as reflected in the models. 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, found in many cyanobacteria, complete the tca cycle despite the absence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase  <cit> . both of the enzymes in the alternate pathway are present within icyt <dig>  and were transferred to all five models. the associated genes are also bidirectional best hits with the two genes in synechococcus pcc  <dig> that are associated with the aforementioned enzymes  <cit> . icyn <dig>  icyp <dig>  and icyh <dig> all contain an alkane biosynthetic pathway similar to what is present within icyt <dig>  while icyt <dig> contains the pathway that enables the production of pentadecane from hexadecenoyl-acp, schirmer et al. have measured heptadecane but not pentadecane production from cyanothece  <dig>  <cit> . icyn <dig> contains only heptadecane production, while icyp <dig> and icyh <dig> contain pathways for both pentadecane and heptadecane . the two enzymes required, hexadecenoyl-acp reductase and hexadecenal decarbonylase  numbers  <dig> . <dig>  and  <dig> . <dig>  respectively per icyt773), have no corresponding annotations or orthologous genes in cyanothece  <dig> or  <dig>  <cit> .

polyhydroxyalkanoates  are a complex family of polyesters that can be synthesized by a wide variety of bacteria  <cit> . cyanothece  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> all contain the enzymes keto-thiolase and acetoacetyl-coa reductase, which are necessary for the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoic acids  <cit> . there are rast and unreviewed uniprot annotations that identify genes within each of these three organisms associated with a pha synthase. the non-fermentative pathway for higher alcohols exist in the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> strains  <cit> . the same pathway has been seen in e. coli <cit>  after the addition of the kivd gene from lactococcus lactis <cit>  and the adh <dig> gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . the pathway uses the 2-keto acid intermediates of amino acid biosynthesis and diverts them towards the synthesis of alcohols  <cit> . the kivd gene codes for a 2-keto acid decarboxylase that acts on a wide range of substrates and enables the conversion of the 2-keto acids into aldehydes. the workflow identified genes in cyanothece  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> which are bidirectional best hits with the kivd gene from lactococcus lactis, and also annotated as being associated with the same ec number as kivd. an alcohol dehydrogenase, such as adh <dig>  then converts these aldehydes into alcohols. the adha gene  in synechocystis pcc  <dig> has been found to have wide substrate specificity that includes the aldehydes associated with butanol and propanol  <cit> . all five species contained a gene that was a bidirectional best hit with slr <dig>  while both the forward and reverse blast searches for cyanothece  <dig> had e-values on the order of 10- <dig> and percent identities of 30%, the searches, both forward and reverse, for the other four organisms had e-values ranging between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> with percent identities ranging from  <dig> to 61%. the presence of orthologs to both a 2-keto acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase with wide ranges of specificity in cyanothece  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> provides annotation evidence for the hypothesized presence of non-fermentative higher alcohol pathways  <cit> .

significant variations in nitrogen metabolism between the five species has been documented  <cit> . arginine decarboxylase is present in all five reconstructions, but differences arise in the subsequent agmatine catabolism. cyanothece  <dig> does not contain the associated genes for the conversion of agmatine to putrescine, and this is reflected in the icyt <dig> model  <cit>  as these reactions are absent. both icyc <dig> and icyj <dig> contain agmatinase and urease. the proposed pathway for agmatine breakdown into putrescine in cyanothece  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> is through n-carbamoylputrescine. the two reactions required for this degradation can be found in all three associated models. finally, as predicted by bandyopadhyay et al.  <cit> , icyc <dig>  icyj <dig>  icyp <dig>  and icyh <dig> contain the reactions required to break putrescine down into spermidine and spermine.

validation of proposed reconstruction workflow
additional reactions retrieved using reviewed annotations have provided a number of insights into the five species that would not have been either found or confirmed if reactions were only pulled from icyt <dig>  the diverging nitrogen metabolism reactions were retrieved using seed, as agmatine is the preferred polyamine for cyanothece  <dig>  <cit> . an alternative butanol pathway is present in varying stages of completion in the five models. while butanol can be produced from a 2-keto acid as previously discussed, it can also be produced through the coenzyme a dependent pathway  <cit> . the coenzyme a dependent pathway was found to exist within a clostridium species  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the comparative level of completion of the fermentative butanol pathway within each of the five species. cyanothece  <dig> is the only organism to contain the complete pathway. the alcohol dehydrogenase exists within the models given the identification of homologs to the synechocystis adha gene  <cit> . the 7424/ <dig> and 8801/ <dig> pairs have the same enzymes. figure  <dig> also shows e-values for the blast searches between the genes and the genes in the fermentative butanol pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  given the lower e-value for butanoyl-coa dehydrogenase, it is the gene most likely to not be present or functional within cyanothece  <dig>  the enzymes present in the five pathways mirror the phylogenetic relationship trends of the five species in a manner comparable to what was initially seen in the reaction similarities from figure  <dig>  as well as with the glyoxylate shunt and nitrogen metabolism.

the proposed workflow also served to complete unfinished pathways from icyt <dig>  all five models are capable of converting galactose-1-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate as in icyt <dig>  three of the models, icyn <dig>  icyj <dig>  and icyh <dig>  also include the reaction that converts galactose into galactose-1-phosphate, enabling them to process galactose in the glycolysis pathway. tetrahydrobiopterin  is a pteridine compound that acts as a cofactor for nitric oxide synthases and aromatic amino acid hydrolases in higher animals  <cit> . pteridine glycosides have been found in cyanobacteria, although their function is still unknown  <cit> , and the first isolated pteridine glycosyltransferase from synechococcus pcc  <dig> acted on bh <dig>  <cit> . even though icyt <dig> does not contain the complete bh <dig> pathway as described by thony et al.  <cit> , our workflow completed the pathway in all five species, identifying a gene that is a bidirectional best hit with the gene in synechococcus pcc  <dig>  the reaction was not included in the models, as it does not exist within the seed reaction database. all enzymes that were retrieved from annotations but were not included in the model because of a lack of associated reaction in the subset of the seed database used for model development are listed in additional file  <dig> 

reactions not transferred from icyt <dig> offer insight into divergences between the metabolism of the new organism and the reference model. two of the reactions that were not transferred from icyt <dig> to the models for cyanothece  <dig> and  <dig> are responsible for the conversion of hexa- or octadecenoyl-acp to n-hepta or pentadecane. as previously mentioned it is accepted that the alkane biosynthetic pathway does not exist in these organisms  <cit> . another compound that is generally not found in the five species is xanthine, a purine base involved in the breakdown of purine ribonucleotides such as inosine-5′-phosphate and xanthosine-5′-phosphate, into uric acid. icyt <dig> can produce xanthine from either hypoxanthine or xanthosine, icyc <dig> only contains the reactions for production from xanthosine and cannot break xanthine down into uric acid. icyn <dig> only contains the reactions for production from hypoxanthine, but can convert xanthine into uric acid. the other three species do not contain any reactions involving xanthine and thus cannot process purine ribonucleotides through this pathway. six reactions involved in transporting metabolites between the cytoplasm and periplasm or extracellular space were not transferred, such as molybdate transport via the abc system. given the likelihood that such reactions still exist within the other cyanothece strains, it is possible that the associated gpr in icyt <dig> should be reevaluated for these reactions.

comparisons with other model development methods
current model development methods can be generally characterized as manual, semi-automated, or automated. the workflow presented in this paper is best classified as semi-automated. this workflow allows for more expedited model development while avoiding some of the sources of error plaguing automated model generation and allowing for a wide range of customization. this workflow can be adapted for use with any models, annotation sources, and additional reaction sets given annotation availability and user preferences.

many draft models are nowadays generated through the identification and comparison of homologs with the gprs of curated models  <cit> . hamilton et al. identified the possibility for bidirectional blast searches to identify false positive ortholog pairs  <cit> . the e-value cutoff for the searches performed for the test was 10- <dig>  here we use a more conservative cutoff of 10- <dig> to safeguard against such instances. when the cutoff was relaxed from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> for the bidirectional blast between cyanothece  <dig> and the five species there were between  <dig> and  <dig> additional best hit pairs for each of the organisms. the number of these pairs that involved genes present in icyt <dig> varied between  <dig> for cyanothece  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> for cyanothece  <dig>  the reliance of manually constructed models on reviewing every annotation and manually curating the model greatly increases the time spent on development. this workflow helps to mitigate the need for manual review of each annotation by only using annotations that are reviewed or are derived from reviewed sources. manual curation can then be reserved for certain key steps. some of these models only include additional reactions beyond those retrieved from the curated models if the reactions are required for biomass production  <cit> . this restricts the inclusion of reactions unique to either that organism or a subset of organisms that the reference models do not belong to. this introduces the risk of not including secondary metabolism pathways, which could be of great interest. the workflow presented here aims to overcome this through the use of outside annotations to retrieve seed reactions.

there are a number of approaches for the automated development of metabolic reconstructions  <cit>  affording significant gains in development time, however, at the expense of some omissions and erroneous additions. the cyanothece models created using the mirage method contain generalized lipids along with a non-specific acceptor metabolite  <cit> . both the kbase and mirage models constructed for cyanothece  <dig> contain menaquinone and ubiquinone, compounds shown to not exist within that organism  <cit> . conversely, there are a number of metabolites present in the biomass composition of the five reconstructed models that do not exist within either in the kbase or mirage models . the model produced through kbase also does not contain the pigment β-carotene. many of these models do not have specified compartments apart from cytoplasm and extracellular space  <cit> . automated model development can exclude unique metabolic pathways if they are absent from the training set of models. specifically, both the mirage and kbase models generally lack light reactions.

other methods that combine manual and automated steps provide their own distinct approach to model reconstruction. the raven toolbox  <cit>  allows for the curation of a reconstruction from models of related species using homologs identified through blast bidirectional best hits, and additional unique functions supplied through annotations taken from kegg orthology  <cit> . this method was employed for the construction of the penicillium chrysogenum model ial <dig>  <cit> . our workflow can currently pull from up to three sources, with the ability to quickly expand the number of sources sampled, resulting in more identified ec numbers with higher confidence.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we presented a workflow that was used to rapidly develop curated models for five cyanothece strains using the previously published icyt <dig> model and reviewed annotations from numerous sources. the comparisons between these five models line up with the established phylogenetic relationships between the species. specific reactions that were both kept from being taken from icyt <dig> or added from the seed database demonstrate the efficacy of this workflow and provide insights into the metabolism of the five species, as well as suggesting areas for further curation in the icyt <dig> model. this workflow can easily be adapted to work with other metabolic models, annotation sources, and reaction databases. all five models  are included in the supplementary material.
