BACKGROUND
the human gut harbours a complex microbial ecosystem which may encode ~ <dig> times as many genes as the human genome and reaches a population density of 1013- <dig> cells in the distal colon  <cit> . this ecosystem is composed predominantly of bacteria belonging to the firmicutes , and bacteroidetes   <cit> , and it is estimated that the majority of species comprising this community  remain uncultured  <cit> . metagenomic studies have begun to provide valuable insights into the metabolic activities undertaken by this community and the impact of this microbial ecosystem on host physiology and health  <cit> .

activities of the gut microbiota are the product of a long co-evolutionary relationship between host and microbe, which has resulted in a community that undertakes many functions beneficial to the human host  <cit> . the resident population of mobile genetic elements  associated with the human gut microbiota  will also reflect the co-evolution of host and microbe in this community, with functions encoded by plasmids and other mge shaped according to key environmental stresses, and host-microbe interactions important to life in the human gut  <cit> .

characterisation of cultivatable members of the human gut microbiota has highlighted the role of mobile genetic elements  in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in this community  <cit> . in particular, the spread of erythromycin resistance genes among bacteriodes sp. is well documented and attributed to mobilisation by conjugative transposons  <cit> . evidence also exists for horizontal gene transfer  of tetracycline resistance genes in the gut microbial community  <cit> . furthermore, the transfer of plasmids and transposons between diverse and disparate members of the mammalian gut microbiota has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

genes involved in survival and persistence in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as activities that impact on host-microbe or microbe-microbe interactions, are also likely to be encoded by the gut mobile metagenome. as such elucidation of the functions encoded by the mge associated with this community will be important in defining key aspects of this ecosystem. in addition, future attempts to manipulate this complex community for the enhancement of human health will require the genetic dissection of constituent species, for which plasmid vectors and other genetic tools are currently lacking. exploitation of plasmids and other mge populating the gut ecosystem will provide the raw genetic material for the development of such tools.

however, the large proportion of uncultivated species comprising the human gut microbiota has impeded study of this community, including the associated mobile metagenome. overall little is known about the population of mge that reside within this ecosystem, the genes and pathways they encode, or their contribution to ecosystem maintenance and function. owing to the difficulty in accessing many members of this community, the application of culture-independent approaches to study mge are required to further study this flexible gene pool. this has resulted in the development of metagenomic approaches aimed at investigating a range of mge, including bacteriophage, plasmids, and integrons  <cit> .

in this study we employed the culture independent transposon aided capture  system to isolate novel plasmids from the human gut microbiota  <cit> . subsequently a comparative metagenomic analysis was undertaken to investigate the distribution of these plasmids among individual gut metagenomes, as well as the relative abundance of plasmid encoded functions in the human gut microbiome.

RESULTS
plasmid annotation and prediction of encoded functions
plasmids were acquired from the gut microbiome of a healthy volunteer using the traca system as previously described  <cit> . the complete nucleotide sequences of four plasmids designated ptraca <dig>  ptraca <dig>  ptraca <dig> and ptraca <dig> were obtained and annotated. these plasmids ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb in size with g+c contents of  <dig> % to  <dig> % .

genes assigned putative functions in replication and mobilization were identified on all plasmids along with open reading frames  of unknown function, many of which exhibited no significant homology to sequences present in the databases . this result indicates that a large number of uncharacterized activities, which may be relevant to ecosystem function, are encoded by plasmids in the gut community. for plasmids ptraca <dig> and ptraca <dig> the only functions encoded by these plasmids that could be assigned a putative function were those related to plasmid replication and mobilisation. however, further study is required to confirm the functional assignments of the genes encoded by these plasmids.

in the case of ptraca <dig> and ptraca <dig>  orfs predicted to encode systems involved in segregational stability and site specific integration or recombination were also identified . plasmid ptraca <dig> was predicted to encode a putative para type atpase  with high identity to the para plasmid segregation protein from lawsonia intracellularis plasmid  <dig> , as well as a tyrosine site specific integrase  belonging to the int family of recombinases . this integrase may mediate site specific recombination either within the same molecule of dna or between distinct molecules of dna  <cit> . as such, orf30- <dig> may be involved in the resolution of plasmid dimers   <cit> , or mediate the site specific integration of ptraca <dig> into the chromosome of the host bacterium. the presence of a putative excisionase on ptraca <dig>  strengthens this integration hypothesis.

plasmid ptraca <dig> was also predicted to encode genes involved in plasmid stabilization and a relbe toxin/anti-toxin  addiction module was identified . in addition, a putative entericidin toxin was also identified in this plasmid  but no corresponding antitoxin was detected . orfs encoded by plasmid ptraca <dig> exhibited a striking homology to sequences from the draft genome of blautia hydrogenotrophica dsm  <dig> . all ptraca <dig> orfs were found to be between 98-100% identical at the amino acid level to orfs from b. hydrogenotrophica . homologous orfs identified in b. hydrogenotrophica appeared to be contiguous based on gene locus identifiers , however it is unclear at present if these correspond to a plasmid present in b. hydrogenotrophica as a finished genome sequence for this organism is currently unavailable.

comparative metagenomic analysis of plasmids and encoded functions
the presence of these plasmids, and the relative abundance of their encoded functions in the human gut microbiome was investigated using metagenomic data sets derived from fifteen human gut microbiomes, the sargasso sea, soil, and the combined gut metagenomes of lean and obese mice  <cit> . initially metagenomes were searched for nucleotide sequences homologous to newly characterised plasmids , as well as two previously characterised plasmids  isolated from the same individual also using the traca system  <cit> .

no significant hits were found for ptraca <dig>  ptraca <dig>  or ptraca <dig> in any of the metagenomes examined, and only limited homology to ptraca <dig> was observed in one human gut metagenome . in contrast, for plasmids ptraca <dig> and ptraca <dig> nucleotide sequences with high identity to regions of these plasmids were detected in multiple human gut metagenomes which included both american and japanese individuals . searches of marine, terrestrial, and murine gut metagenomes failed to identify any nucleotide sequences with significant homology to any of the plasmids analysed .

nucleotide sequences with high identity to ptraca <dig> were detected in  <dig> of the  <dig> human gut metagenomes examined. in total  <dig> % of the ptraca <dig> nucleotide sequence was represented at 90% identity or greater in the collective human gut metagenomes examined, while  <dig> % was represented at 80% identity or greater . nucleotide sequences with high identity to ptraca <dig> were identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> human gut metagenomes searched, and these sequences all related to a distinct region of the ptraca <dig> plasmid. this region encodes a putative phosphohydrolase/phophoesterase belonging to cog <dig> , with high identity to an orf from the draft genome sequence of collinsella aerofaciens atcc <dig> .

due to the detection of nucleotide sequences homologous to ptraca <dig> and ptraca <dig> among multiple human gut microbiomes, the relative abundance of functions encoded by these plasmids in the human gut microbiome was assessed. this analysis revealed that functions encoded by ptraca <dig> and ptraca <dig> are more common in the human gut microbiome when compared to the non-human metagenomic datasets analysed. several of these orfs were found to be significantly more prevalent in the combined human gut metagenomes when compared to murine, marine and soil metagenomes . of these the most highly enriched functions were the ptraca <dig> phosphoesterase/phosphohydrolase  along with orf10- <dig> , and the ptraca <dig> relbe toxin-antitoxin addiction module .

variation between individuals was explored using searches of the  <dig> individual human gut metagenomes to identify amino acid sequences homologous to plasmid encoded orfs. this revealed that orf10- <dig>  orf22- <dig>  and orf22- <dig> also appeared to be widely distributed among the individual human gut metagenomes examined . while the increased abundance of proteins involved in functions such as dna replication are expected and in line with findings from other metagenomic studies  <cit> , the significance of the increased prevalence observed for other plasmid encoded functions in this ecosystem is unclear.

in particular the greater incidence of relbe addiction modules in the human gut microbiota was unexpected. ta modules have previously been demonstrated to be highly abundant in free living bacteria and archaea from a wide range of habitats, and absent in obligate intracellular prokaryotes  <cit> . as such the high relative abundance of the identified relbe ta modules in the human gut microbiota compared to other metagenomic datasets is surprising, and may indicate the development of a gut associated relbe sub type, rather than an absence of relbe genes in microbial populations from other environments.

alternatively, ta modules such as mazef, parde, and higba may be more prevalent in natural environments with relbe modules present at a lower abundance. to test this hypothesis the relative abundance in human gut, marine, terrestrial and murine metagenomes of ta modules from other families was assessed and compared to the ptraca <dig> relbe module . no other ta modules were found to be as prevalent in the human gut microbiome as homologues of the ptraca <dig> relbe. the relative abundance of each module in non-human metagenomes were similar but generally lower in human gut metagenomes . however, the mazf toxin component of mazef modules appeared to be more prevalent in human gut metagenomes than the corresponding antitoxin or other ta genes, and this was also the case in the marine and murine metagenomes .

phylogenetic analysis of ptraca <dig> and metagenomic rele sequences
to further explore the distribution of relbe ta modules in the gut metagenome and the relationship between the ptraca <dig> relbe module, homologous ta modules from combined human gut metagenomes, and those encoded on plasmids or bacterial chromosomes, a phylogenetic analysis using rele toxin components was undertaken.

human gut metagenomic nucleotide sequences were retrieved and both rele and relb orfs were identified . the majority of metagenomic sequences were found to encode complete relbe addiction modules exhibiting characteristic genetic architecture, in which relb genes are encoded upstream of and overlapping the start codon of the rele gene  <cit> . in the majority of sequences where a cognate relb was not detected this could be attributed to truncation of the sequence, or the presence of orphan toxin genes . however several sequences were identified in which a suitable relb candidate orf was detected up stream of the identified rele gene, but lacked relb conserved domains or significant homology to relb proteins .

the resulting set of  <dig> full length rele homologues were initially affiliated with bacterial phylogenetic divisions based on the species identified in blastp or tblastn searches of the nr dataset . the majority of rele homologues identified were found to exhibit highest identity to sequences from bacteria belonging to the firmicutes,  and proteobacteria . firmicutes have been estimated to represent a significant proportion of the gut microbiota and co-dominate this ecosystem with members of the bacteroidetes division  <cit> . as such the large proportion of human gut metagenome derived rele affiliated with this division is not unexpected, however, in comparison few sequences were affiliated with the bacteroidetes division .

in contrast, proteobacteria account for a relatively minor proportion of the adult gut microbiota  <cit> , but may co-dominate with actinobacteria in the infant gut  <cit> . interestingly the majority of gut metagenomic rele types assigned to this group exhibited high identity to the escherichia coli pars <dig> plasmid . the pars <dig> plasmid was originally identified in a clinical isolate of e. coli designated ars <dig>  which was obtained from the urine of an inpatient in a japanese general hospital  <cit> . subsequent characterisation revealed pars <dig> to be a large  conjugative plasmid encoding a novel 16s methyltransferase, that functions as a broad spectrum amino glycoside resistance determinant  <cit> .

overall,  <dig> distinct full length putative rele "types"  were retrieved from combined human gut metagenomes , and aligned with the ptraca <dig> rele, and homologous plasmid and chromosomally encoded sequences retrieved using standard blastp and tblastn searches of the nr dataset . notably, searches of the public databases encompassed by the nr dataset did not identify any homologous sequences originating in archaea, and specific searches of the genome sequences of the gut associated archaeal species methoanobrevibacter smithii and methanosphaera stadmanae, also failed to identify any homologues.

alignments of rele amino acid sequences revealed conserved residues, and highlighted regions of similarity as well as regions predominantly conserved among metagenomic sequences . overall metagenomic sequences generally showed less divergence from the ptraca <dig> rele than other sequences included in the alignment, and the c terminus l and f residues appeared completely conserved among these sequences .

construction of phylogenetic trees using the aligned rele sequences showed that the  <dig> distinct metagenomic rele "types" are associated with all major bacterial divisions in the human gut . the ptraca <dig> rele was most closely related to sequences from blautia hydrogenotrophica dsm  <dig> , but was also closely related to sequences from human gut metagenomes  and the e. coli pars <dig> plasmid . the association of the e. coli pars <dig> rele with ptraca <dig> and other gut derived sequences in our phylogenetic analysis , rather than sequences originating in e. coli , other gram negative enteric species, or other plasmid encoded sequences, indicates that this plasmid may be closely related to ptraca <dig> 

furthermore, both chromosomally encoded and plasmid encoded sequences originating in gram negative enteric genus such as escherichia, salmonella, shigella, and yersinia appeared distinct from both human gut metagenomic sequences, and those derived from draft genomes of gram negative and gram positive gut associated species . in particular, plasmid encoded rele were observed to form a discrete clade, and were largely distinct from the chromosomally encoded rele represented in our dataset . similar observations have been noted previously for the ccdab ta system, where plasmid encoded and chromosomally encoded toxins formed distinct clusters in phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . while it is unclear whether the sequences obtained from human gut metagenomes are encoded chromosomally or by plasmids, as chromosomal dna represents the vast majority of the metagenomic datasets utilised it is most likely that chromosomally encoded ta modules have been retrieved.

the e. coli pars <dig> is <dig> composite transposon is closely related to ptraca22
due to the close association between the ptraca <dig> and pars <dig> rele observed in our phylogenetic analysis, the potential relationship between these plasmids was further explored. comparison of ptraca <dig> and the available pars <dig> sequence  using the artemis comparison tool  revealed that ptraca <dig> shares high identity with a region of pars <dig> encoding a  <dig>  kb is <dig> based composite transposon . notably the regions of ptraca <dig> encoding the plasmid replication protein  and the relbe ta addiction module  exhibited very high identity to the available pars <dig> is26tn region at the nucleotide level, but no homology to other plasmids from e. coli or closely related enteric organisms was observed for the is26tn sequence .

as several of the ptraca <dig> orfs mapped to the homologous region of pars <dig> did not correspond to any orfs identified during the original characterisation of this plasmid  <cit> , or currently annotated in the genbank record, the available pars <dig> sequence was re-annotated for this study . this analysis identified several additional orfs with high identity to orfs encoded by ptraca <dig>  and revealed similar gene architecture . wachino et al.   <cit>  also reported the presence of a mobilization protein in the pars <dig> is26tn designated orf <dig>  which was truncated by the insertion of an is <dig> element. it is likely that this corresponds to the ptraca <dig> mobilisation protein orf22- <dig>  but as the sequence data for these regions of the pars <dig> is26tn are not currently available, this hypothesis cannot be confirmed.

in contrast to the pars <dig> is26tn, ptraca <dig> does not encode the npma aminoglycoside resistance gene or the adjacent abc transporter binding protein  and the region of the pars <dig> is26tn encoding these shows no homology to ptraca <dig>  furthermore, no is <dig> elements were detected in ptraca <dig> 

overall the pars <dig> is26tn appears to have originated from a plasmid related to ptraca <dig>  and encodes genes with high identity to those found in the draft genomes of gut associated firmicutes, particularly b. hydrogenotrophica dsm  <dig> . this also raises the possibility that the novel aminoglycoside resistance mechanism encoded by the pars <dig> is26tn originated in the human gut microbiome. however, tblastn searches of the human gut datasets used for comparative metagenomic analysis  <cit>  did not yield any significant hits to the pars <dig> npm a protein.

discussion
in this study we have applied a metagenomic approach to isolate and characterise novel plasmids from the human gut microbiome. these plasmids ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, and at present it is unclear if this size range represents a limitation of the traca system used to isolate them, a pre-dominance of smaller plasmids in the gut microbiome or a combination of these factors  <cit> . the range of g+c contents of plasmids isolated corresponds with the overall range in genomic g+c content observed among the major bacterial divisions comprising the human gut microbiota. the actinobacteria constitute a major phylogenetic division within the human gut comprising high g+c gram positive species  <cit> . in contrast other major phylogenetic groups, firmicutes and bacteriodetes, are comprised of low g+c gram-positives and gram-negatives respectively  <cit> . as such plasmids of a high g+c content  are likely to originate from bacteria belonging to the actinobacteria.

of the six complete plasmid sequences utilised in this study, no significant homology to ptraca <dig>  ptraca <dig> or ptraca <dig> was identified in any of the metagenome data sets examined. this may simply be due to a low abundance of these plasmids in the human gut microbiota, the generally low coverage of bacterial communities offered by current metagenomic data sets, or may reflect intra-individual variation in plasmids associated with the gut community. alternatively, the apparent absence of these or closely related plasmids in the human gut metagenomes examined, may be attributed to a general incompatibility of plasmid dna with the standard metagenomic approach used to generate many of the currently available datasets, which is focused on acquisition and sequencing of bacterial genomic dna  <cit> .

in contrast sequences homologous to plasmids ptraca <dig> and ptraca <dig> were identified in multiple human gut metagenomes. in particular, ptraca <dig> appeared well represented in the combined human gut metagenomes analysed, and the absence of nucleotide sequences homologous to this plasmid in the non-human datasets, coupled with its presence in human gut datasets from geographically isolated individuals with a broad global distribution, suggests that ptraca <dig> may be unique to the human gut microbiota. this has also been observed for bacteriophage present in the human gut community and recently ebdon et al.  reported that bacteriophages isolated from human faecal material were specific to the human gut, and absent in the general environment, as well as faecal samples from horses, sheep, pigs, cattle, rabbits and poultry  <cit> . furthermore the general enrichment of certain mge in the human gut microbiome has also been reported in recent metagenomic studies  <cit> .

investigation of the relative abundance of functions encoded by ptraca <dig> and ptraca <dig> revealed that several show a higher abundance in the human gut microbiome . in particular the increased prevalence of the ptraca <dig> ta addiction module in the human gut microbiome was unexpected, and the significance of this observation is currently unclear. ta modules have been shown to contribute to plasmid stability and maintenance through a post segregational killing mechanism, and consist of a stable toxin component which is inactivated by an unstable antitoxin  <cit> . loss of the plasmid from daughter cells ultimately results in a loss of the antitoxin component and the killing of plasmid free cells  <cit> . in the case of the relbe system, rele encodes an rna interferase which cleaves mrna in a site specific manner at ribosomes, blocking translation  <cit> . plasmid encoded ta modules are also involved in plasmid-plasmid competition  <cit> , and plasmids harbouring a ta module have been shown to outcompete counterparts from the same incompatibility group lacking a ta module  <cit> . these attributes of ta modules may facilitate the maintenance of plasmids, or other dna molecules harbouring them, in the human gut microbiome, and contribute to the observed prevalence of relbe modules in this ecosystem . however, this explanation does not account for the lower prevalence observed for non-human metagenomes.

ta modules that are active and functional in surrogate cloning hosts may also generate bias in metagenomic libraries by enhancing stabilisation of constructs  harbouring them. any such effects of ta modules could also account for the increased prevalence of the ptraca <dig> relbe and homologous modules in the human gut microbiome, as well as the differences between the relative abundance of toxin and antitoxin homologs . however, considering that orphan rele toxin genes were identified on sequences retrieved from human gut metagenomes, and no increase in relative abundance was observed for the other ta modules analysed in this study, this explanation seems unlikely .

it is also possible that bias between the metagenomic data sets due to variation in methods for construction of metagenomic libraries, such as efficiency of dna extraction protocols, may account for the observed differences in prevalence of plasmid encoded functions between human and non-human metagenomes. however, the data sets utilised in this study were generated using comparable approaches, and in the case of the  <dig> human gut metagenomes utilised, which were generated by  <dig> distinct research teams  <cit> , no demarcation between data sets from different groups was identified during our analysis. this is despite the observed paucity of sequences from bacteriodes sp. in the metagenomes generated by gill et al.   <cit> . furthermore, analysis of other ta modules revealed a similar prevalence among the all metagenomic data sets, with few significant differences between human and non-human data sets .

plasmids and other mge are also potentially involved in the maintenance of ecosystem functions, and retention of genes within this community in the absence of any selective pressure for the functions they encode. many plasmids are highly stable even when providing no obvious survival advantage to the host cell, and numerous explanations have been suggested for the apparent stability of plasmids encoding traits such as antibiotic or heavy metal resistance, in the absence of direct selective pressure. these include the existence of unidentified selective pressures acting directly on the resistance or other genes encoded by a plasmid, or provision of a survival advantage sufficient to overcome the metabolic burden imposed on plasmid carrying cells, when selective pressure is removed  <cit> .

however, ta modules may also constitute a mechanism by which plasmids and the genes they encode are retained in the absence of direct selective pressure  <cit> . it has also been proposed that chromosomally encoded ta modules may stabilise regions of adjacent dna and maintain their vertical transmission  <cit> . thus both plasmid and chromosomally encoded ta modules may be important in maintaining functional stability of microbial ecosystems such as the human gut microbiome.

the wide distribution and high prevalence of chromosomally encoded ta modules in both bacteria and archaea  has also lead to the hypothesis that these systems are advantageous to the host bacterium  <cit> . since the majority of sequence data in the metagenomic libraries utilised will be derived from chromosomal dna, most of the relbe ta modules identified in the human gut microbiomes will be chromosomally encoded. therefore it is also plausible that the increased abundance of these ta modules in the human gut microbiome is due to effects on the fitness of the bacterial host. interestingly, while assessment of other ta modules did not reveal the prevalence observed for the ptraca <dig> relbe, the mazf toxin, which also functions as a ribonuclease and blocks translation by the same mechanism as rele  <cit> , did exhibit an increased prevalence in the human gut microbiome as well as other environments, albeit to a lesser extent . diverse functions have been proposed for chromosomally encoded ta modules in bacteria and archaea, and it is possible that these functions are also important in gut associated bacterial species.

relbe and mazef ta modules have been shown to modulate gene expression, undertake quality control of this process, and facilitate bacterial survival under nutrient limiting conditions or other environmental stresses  <cit> . the involvement of ta modules in gene expression may also be relevant to adaptation of prokaryotes to new environments, and ta modules have been implicated in the formation of persister cells which can survive exposure to antimicrobials and other stresses that are otherwise fatal  <cit> . it has also been proposed that chromosomally encoded rele and pare toxins are exploited as cellular regulators, and that the acquisition of these elements through hgt mediates the rapid development of novel regulatory pathways which facilitates adaptation to new environments through modulation of gene expression  <cit> . the formation of persister cells and the development of new regulatory pathways via ta have important implications for colonization of the gut, as well as survival of bacterial cells in the external environment, or during transmission to new hosts. however, the exact function of relbe ta modules in bacteria inhabiting the human intestinal tract is currently unknown, and will require further detailed study to elucidate.

interestingly, no rele sequences homologous to the ptraca <dig> rele were identified in gut associated archaeal species. since ta modules such as relbe have been observed as highly prevalent and widely distributed in free living archaea, and were identified in bacterial species from all major phylogenetic divisions in the gut microbial community, the lack of sequences homologus to the ptraca <dig> rele in dominant gut archaeal species  was surprising. this may reflect differences in selective pressures imposed on bacteria and archaea colonising the human gut, or the adoption of alternate strategies to cope with the same environmental stress. while the exact nature and source of the observed difference between gut archaea and bacteria remain unclear, the identification of functions shared or distinct to each lineage will be important in developing a full understanding of the gut microbiota, and the contribution of constituent species to the development and output of this community.

the putative relbe ta addiction module identified on ptraca <dig> also has potential to impact on eukaryotic cells present in the human gut through activity of the rele toxin component. while no eukaryotic homologues of rele have been identified, this toxin has been shown to be active against both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. the rele toxin is functional in eukaryotic cells and has been shown to induce apoptosis in cultured human cell lines  <cit> , inhibit the growth of yeast  <cit> , and to cleave eukaryotic mrna in the a site of eukaryotic ribosomes in a similar fashion to that described in bacteria  <cit> . however, studies demonstrating the activity of rele in eukaryotic cells are currently limited to artificial expression of the toxin using a specialised vector  <cit> . as such further study is required to identify the in vivo effect, if any, of rele toxins on eukaryotic cells, particularly in light of the increased prevalence of this ta module in the gut human gut microbiome.

as well as a wide distribution among human metagenomic data sets, ptraca <dig> was also found to illuminate the transfer of genetic material between diverse members of the gut microbiota . the high identity of ptraca <dig> to the e. coli pars <dig> is26-like transposon, indicates that this region of pars <dig> is derived from a plasmid closely related to ptraca <dig> , raising several intriguing possibilities. in particular the presence of the ptraca <dig> putative replication protein on the pars <dig> is26tn may allow pars <dig> to function as a natural shuttle vector and replicate in disparate bacterial hosts. considering the high identity of ptraca <dig> encoded genes to b. hydrogenotrophica, this scenario would likely encompass replication in both gram -ve and gram +ve species. furthermore, the presence of a relbe addiction module  in the pars <dig> is26tn could stabilise pars <dig> during transition between bacterial hosts, and provide this plasmid with a competitive advantage over other related elements in the same incompatibility group  <cit> .

while the site of gene exchange that resulted in the formation of the pars <dig> is26tn cannot be determined with complete certainty, several factors indicate the human or mammalian gi tract: i) both species involved in the genetic exchange  naturally inhabit the human gut; ii) the high oxygen sensitivity of many cultivated firmicutes comprising the gut microbiota points to an anaerobic environment such as the human gut  <cit> ; iii) the paucity of sequences homologous to ptraca <dig> in the non-human gut metagenomes analysed here. overall the high identity of ptraca <dig> with the pars <dig> is26tn supports the hypothesis that the human gut is a potential hotspot for hgt between disparate bacterial species  <cit> , and highlights the potential for gene transfer from commensal organisms to clinically relevant pathogenic speices.

in light of the observed prevalence of relbe ta modules in the human gut microbiome, the reported functionality of the rele toxins in eukaryotic cells, and the potential role of this system in mediating bacterial survival in the gut environment, the relbe module encoded by ptraca <dig> merits further investigation, and these studies are currently underway in our laboratory. furthermore, continued analysis of the mobile metagenomes associated with microbial communities will be important in understanding many aspects of microbial community function and evolution. a greater knowledge of the mge associated with bacterial communities will also facilitate the development of novel strategies and tools to dissect and manipulate these complex ecosystems.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrate the application of a metagenomic approach to isolate and analyse plasmids resident in the human gut microbiota. the use of the culture independent traca system to capture novel plasmids from the human gut mobile metagenome, coupled with subsequent comparative metagenomic analysis of complete plasmid nucleotide sequences have highlighted the increased prevalence of unexpected functions in the gut ecosystem, and provided new insights into plasmids associated with the human gut microbiome.

the existence of plasmids encoding functions prevalent in the gut microbiome demonstrates the mobility of the relevant genes within this community, and considering the proposed role of hgt in the convergence and expansion of enriched community gene sets  <cit> , the identification and characterisation of such plasmids will be important in understanding the development and evolution of the human gut microbiome. furthermore, as plasmids and other mge frequently encode genes advantageous to survival in a particular environment, the analysis of plasmid encoded genes from the human gut mobile metagenome is likely to provide important insights into challenges faced by microbes colonising the human gut, and the mechanisms by which these are overcome.
