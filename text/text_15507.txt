BACKGROUND
primiparous holstein-friesian cows are the most energy-challenged animals on a typical pasture-based dairy farm, because in such a herd, they are at the bottom of the social hierarchy  <cit> . this is because primiparous cows are always the last to be milked and by implication, arrive last in the paddock, thus potentially reducing grazing time. this pattern, coupled with incidences of bullying and competition for grass in the paddock, contributes to low feed intake. given that most first-time calvers are still heifers that are not fully grown at the time of calving , they have to regain post-partum weight loss  and also continue to grow and produce milk  <cit> . therefore, primiparous cows tend to suffer more negative energy balance  than all the animals in the herd. with all these pressures and mating occurring fairly soon after calving, it is no wonder that they tend to have diminished milk production and reproduction performances.

canola plant has been engineered to produce oil with greater concentrations of omega- <dig>  omega- <dig> and adequate omega- <dig> fatty acids. metabolism of canola oil in the rumen is facilitated by rumen microorganisms, particularly bacteria and protozoa. bacterial lipase hydrolyses the triacylglycerols and phospholipids in the consumed dietary oil. once the fatty acids are liberated from their ester linkages, the end products  are utilised in the biohydrogenation process. biohydrogenation is an extensive microbial process that involves the addition of hydrogen molecules to unsaturated free fatty acids concentrated in the rumen. during biohydrogenation, unsaturated fatty acids  are extensively hydrogenated to form saturated fatty acids . the biohydrogenation of linoleic acid to stearic acid is demonstrated in figure  <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
biohydrogenation of linoleic acid to stearic acid.




following biohydrogenation, the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids that escape this process are subsequently absorbed in the small intestine. as a result of rumen biohydrogenation, approximately 85% and 15% saturated and free fatty acids respectively, are transported into the small intestine and this process illustrates the efficiency of rumen microbes. rumen biohydrogenation is the major factor affecting the delivery of fat in the small intestine and subsequent transportation in the blood of ruminants. fat consumption by cows leads to the productions of volatile fatty acids . these volatile fatty acids are the precursors for the production of glucose, carbohydrates and fats.

the energy status of a cow is mostly reflected by its plasma non-esterified fatty acids  and β-hydroxybutyrate  profiles  <cit> . a reduction in the level of plasma glucose can also be used as an indicator of nebal in cows. previous studies have suggested that nefa concentration should be less than  <dig>  mmol for normal cows  <cit> . however, values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mmol postpartum are indicative of nebal  <cit> . to prevent nebal in lactating cows, supplementation with limited amount of dietary fat in a pasture setting to boost postpartum energy intake has been of increasing research interest  <cit> . the effect of dietary fat supplements on plasma metabolites in dairy cows has been inconsistent and highly variable in the published literature. for instance, some studies found increased glucose, nefa, bhba and cholesterol  <cit> , while others found no change  <cit>  or had inconsistent results  <cit> . this suggests that further studies in different production systems are required to enable informed choices and tailored decisions when feeding lactating cows with specific dietary fat supplements, hence the justification for our study in a typical australian pasture-based dairy production system.

the australian dairy industry has increasing interest in crude degummed canola oil  because of its ease of local availability and affordability. however, limited information currently exists in the published literature on the effect of cdco on plasma metabolites. therefore, this study intends to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the effect of dietary inclusion of cdco at incremental levels for eight weeks on the plasma metabolite profiles of primiparous holstein-friesian cows in a pasture-based system. we hypothesized that feeding grazing primiparous holstein-friesian cows for eight weeks with incremental levels of cdco supplement will decrease plasma nefa and bhba, but increase cholesterol and glucose levels.

discussion
enormous remobilization of nefa from adipose tissues postpartum occurs in high merit cows as a sign of transition from gestation to milk production  <cit> . however, high concentrations of nefa in the blood can be toxic and compromise the production and reproduction performances of cows  <cit> . plasma nefa can provide the body tissues with energy when not in excessive quantities. however, when the animal is suffering from negative energy balance, excessive amounts of nefa in the blood can be toxic to the animal. most of the nefa in the liver can be metabolised into triacylglycerols. accumulated nefa leads to excess triacylglycerols accumulating in the liver and the unutilised residual acetyl-coa from the oxidation of fatty acids in the tricarboxylic acid cycle is converted into ketone bodies, such as acetone, acetoacetate and bhba. the results of our current study found no significant effect of feeding cdco on nefa concentration in contrast to andersen et al.  <cit>  and douglas et al.  <cit>  who reported increases in nefa. these previous studies utilized different forms and higher dosages of dietary fat sources which could explain the observed differences. the cdco levels utilised in our study were tailored to avoid feeding greater than the 7% total fat allowed in the diets of grazing animals  <cit>  because it can affect dry matter intake and ruminal fibre digestion  <cit> . another explanation for the lack of observable differences between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups of animals in our study could be related to the metabolisable energy component of the cdco which was very similar for both the control and basal diet . secondly, the result also suggests that the ryegrass pastures that were grazed by the cows were of high quality and provided adequate energy to the postpartum cows to prevent massive adipose tissue remobilisation. the similarity across weeks and between treatment groups  in plasma nefa suggests similar energy intake and utilisation. it has been suggested that three weeks pre-partum to three weeks post-partum is the most energy deficit period for high merit cows  <cit> , but the cows in our study were already  <dig> dim  and might have well passed the critical energy deficit periods, hence the lack of observable treatment differences. it has also been reported that the level of plasma nefa was greater in primiparous cows soon after calving  <cit> , implying that fat supplementation studies on nefa should be carried out during the early calving period  <cit> .

plasma bhba is a product of nefa that is converted into triacylglycerols in the liver  <cit> . in the present study, feeding cdco significantly influenced plasma bhba concentration where a slight, but significant increase in bhba was observed as the level of cdco increased from low to high . our results are in contrast with those of  <cit>  who found that when rumen inert fat was fed to dairy cows, plasma bhba decreased prepartum. this disparity could be linked to the differences in the physiological states of the experimental cows. in our study, the cows were only 40 days in milk coinciding with the early lactation phase, while in their study, the cows were 300 days in milk almost at the end of their lactation. another major area of difference between the two studies lies in the type of fat fed. while we supplemented the cows with crude degummed canola, they fed an inert fat that is rumen-protected. the effect of fat supplementation on plasma bhba has been associated with the availability of carbohydrates  <cit>  and the impact of long chain fatty acids  on hepatic gluconeogenesis  <cit> . it would thus appear that in our study, as the level of cdco supplementation increased, hepatic gluconeogenesis also increased due to a likely influx of available dietary carbohydrates and docosahexaenoic acid.

cholesterol contains lipoproteins and the high and low density lipoproteins  <cit> , which are all precursors for progesterone metabolism  <cit> . progesterone is one of the hormones essential for fertility in cows. fat supplements have been used efficiently to alter the plasma cholesterol concentration of dairy cows  <cit> . however, in the current study, dietary fat did not influence plasma cholesterol concentration. this can partly be explained by the fact that canola is known to contain mainly phytosterol  <cit> . phytosterol contains low levels of cholesterol  <cit> . previous studies have also reported that phytosterol can significantly reduce cholesterol in humans with hypercholesterolemic condition  <cit> . therefore, the lack of significant effect observed in the present study could be explained by the hypocholesterolemic effect of cdco.

the demand for glucose rises sharply post-partum due to increased energy requirements for lactation  <cit> . however, due to low dry matter intake after parturition, the amount of glucose produced is not enough to support the cow’s lactation requirements. ruminal propionate produced during ruminal fermentation is used as a substrate in the gluconeogenesis pathway to produce glucose  <cit> . the effect of dietary fat supplements on plasma glucose has been associated with their ability to provide adequate rumen propionate  <cit> . in the current study, there were no significant differences between cdco-supplemented and unsupplemented cows. the lack of significance in the present result indicates that the dietary fat treatment supplied adequate propionate to the rumen to affect plasma glucose concentration. additionally, the effect of biohydrogenation of unprotected supplementary fat in the rumen was not any different between supplemented and control group of cows  <cit> , hence the availability and levels of substrates necessary for glucose metabolism were similar in all cows.

week of supplementation had a significant influence on nefa, bhba and glucose. this seems to suggest that the longer cows are supplemented with cdco, the greater the impact on plasma metabolite profiles. the negative correlation between nefa and cholesterol, and the positive correlation between cholesterol and glucose in the present study corroborate the theory that negative energy balance can impact negatively on production parameters in a pasture based setting.

when plasma glucose levels decrease, body fat remobilization is instigated from nutrient accrual to provide sufficient energy that can maintain continuous milk production until the animal returns to a positive energy balance. it has been found that cows suffering from negative energy balance have increased concentrations of serum glucagon and growth hormones, whereas the concentrations of insulin and insulin growth factor-i are decreased. some proposed theories postulate that dietary fat supplement favours lower blood nefa concentration by providing extra energy postpartum. other research findings indicate that feeding dairy cows with fat supplements could promote increased insulin production because of the amount of increased energy provided through the production of acetate, propionate and butyrate . however, studies investigating the response of plasma insulin to fat supplementation are inconsistent. for instance, some studies reported decreased plasma concentrations of insulin, while others reported steady insulin increases postpartum in cows fed six different diets containing fats. therefore the mechanism of fat supplementation and relationship with insulin production is still poorly understood and warrants further elucidation.

CONCLUSIONS
canola supplements are effective dietary energy sources because they are involved in the production of volatile fatty acids which serve as lipid metabolic substrates for the synthesis of glucose, fats and carbohydrates for lactation. the concentrations of plasma nefa, bhba and glucose are indicators for gauging the energy balance status of a lactating cow. week of supplementation was a more significant factor than level of cdco supplementation in influencing plasma metabolite profiles, thus suggesting that the duration of supplementation with cdco has a greater impact on all the plasma metabolites investigated in this study. it was also apparent from this study that primiparous cows grazing high quality pasture at about 40 days in milk , had adequate energy intake to overcome any extreme negative energy balance scenario at this stage of lactation. it also implies that fat supplementation may not be necessary in spring when there is abundant and lush pasture, but may be needed during winter or summer when pasture is scanty to boost the energy intake of cows. the hypothesis that feeding grazing primiparous holstein-friesian cows for eight weeks with incremental levels of cdco supplement will decrease plasma non-esterified fatty acid  and β-hydroxybutyrate , but increase plasma cholesterol and glucose metabolites does not hold true and should be rejected. therefore, it is concluded that primiparous holstein-friesian dairy cows in a pasture-based setting have enough energy intakes from grass in spring to maintain adequate production and reproduction performances. however, there is the need for further investigation into the interaction between circulating plasma hormones and gene expression profiles of supplemented cows to provide a better understanding of cdco’s role in future applications as a dietary fat supplement for lactating cows.
