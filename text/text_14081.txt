BACKGROUND
conifers represent over  <dig> species  <cit> , some ranking as the largest, tallest, and longest living terrestrial organisms on earth. they dominate many terrestrial landscapes, represent the largest terrestrial carbon sink, and provide significant ecological services to human societies. they are also of great economic importance, as they are primarily used for biomass, timber and pulp production worldwide. domestication of conifers started about  <dig> years ago through traditional genetic improvement programs  <cit> , which have resulted in substantial improvements of overall growth, wood quality, pest resistance and adaptation to present and future climatic conditions. however, the long generation intervals and the difficulty of accurately evaluating traits in early stages have hampered progress through breeding  <cit> . furthermore, their extraordinary large genome size  prohibits classical map-based cloning approaches of major-effect quantitative trait loci .

during the past  <dig> years, many sophisticated genomic tools have been developed to accelerate the domestication process by exploring in depth their genetic diversity. linkage maps represent a major tool in genomic-based breeding because of their central role in dissecting the genetic architecture of quantitative trait variation  <cit> . moreover, the relatively well conserved genome organization in conifers makes it possible to transfer genetic information from one species to another by comparative mapping . genetic mapping activities, therefore, will continue to dominate research in conifer genetics  <cit>  at least until a conifer genome sequence has been completely decoded.

the progress of genetic mapping in conifers is reflected by the development of different generations of molecular markers. the first  and second generation  markers made it possible to construct genetic linkage maps for twelve pine  and four spruce species  . furthermore, over the last decade, the increasing availability of expressed sequence tags  has provided a valuable source of new pcr-based molecular markers, such as est-derived microsatellites , est-based polymorphisms  and single nucleotide polymorphisms . because of their abundance, higher availability and stability compared with simple sequence repeats , and the ease with which data can be standardized due to their bi-allelic nature, snp markers provide enhanced possibilities for genetic and breeding applications, such as construction of linkage maps and detection of genotype/phenotype associations  <cit> . several snp genotyping approaches have been developed in the last few years. these approaches vary in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility, accuracy, capability of multiplexing and throughput  <cit> . among the snp genotyping technologies available to date, the goldengate assay developed by illumina has demonstrated high success rates within plant genomes of differing complexities, such as pea  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , barley  <cit> , maize  <cit> , spruces  <cit>  and pines  <cit> .

in the present study, a custom goldengate assay containing  <dig>  snps derived from gene sequences was designed to genotype two maritime pine  mapping populations, while earlier studies have heavily relied on anonymous markers such as rapds  <cit>  and aflps  <cit> . the information contained within each individual map was then synthesized into a single consensus map, from which a set of orthologous markers allowed the alignment with the reference pinus taeda linkage map. the present study is therefore an important step for advancing comparative genomics in conifers.

methods
mapping populations
two maritime pine mapping populations were used in this study:  a three-generation outbred pedigree  , comprising  <dig> offspring, and  a three-generation inbred pedigree  obtained by the self pollination of an inter- "landes × corsica" provenance hybrid , resulting in a total number of  <dig> offspring. trees of both mapping populations were measured for a series of quantitative traits related to biomass production and wood properties, for which some qtls have already been detected . the sample size used for mapping was  <dig> and  <dig> offspring for the g <dig> and the f <dig> pedigree, respectively.

dna extraction and quality control
young needles were harvested in spring and conserved at -20°c before dna extraction. pieces of frozen needles  were crushed using a mixer mill . isolation of dna was performed using invisorb dna plants  <dig> kit from invitek  following kit's specific instructions. all concentrations were measured using the fluorescence assay . low values were systematically checked by a second measurement, and all samples with high initial concentrations were diluted to concentrations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> ng/μl. in addition, dna quality was checked on a subset of samples  by loading dna on agarose gel to estimate its integrity. all samples that did not met the concentration and quality criteria recommended by illumina for goldengate assay were excluded from further steps.

est production and assembly
a total of  <dig>  ests were obtained from wood forming tissue, root, needles and vegetative bud . base calling and quality assessment were determined using the phred software  <cit> . vector and adaptor sequences were trimmed using cross-match  <cit>  and custom perl scripts. as sequence data vary in quality, an automatic inspection was performed and sequences >  <dig> bp long and containing more than 90% of nucleotides with high quality  were kept. finally,  <dig>  informative reads were used for the assembly using stackpack™  <cit> , resulting into a unigene set comprising  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons.

snp discovery
a first set  of in vitro polymorphisms was detected in  <dig> different gene fragments involved in plant cell wall formation or drought stress resistance . for each fragment, an average of  <dig> megagametophytes  from different populations covering the natural range of the species were sequenced . the chromatograms were aligned with codoncode aligner  and visually checked. nucleotides with phred scores <  <dig> were considered as missing data. the use of megagametophytes lowered the risk of confusing polymorphism at a unique locus with differences between paralogous loci, as amplification of two or even more members of a gene family would have been easily detected by the visualization of double peaks in the "haploid" chromatograms. a second set  of in vitro polymorphisms was detected in  <dig> different amplicons re-sequenced in the frame of the crsp project  <cit> . the discovery panel in this case consisted of  <dig> megagametophytes , including the parents of the g <dig> and f <dig> progenies. sanger sequencing was externalized  and followed custom protocols in 384-well format. the seqqual pipeline  <cit>  was used to assemble the sequences for each fragment and to mask nucleotides with phred scores below  <dig>  the chromatograms and alignments were visually checked and only those resulting in a single, well-aligned contig without double peaks at polymorphic sites were kept for further applications. then, we used the perl script snp2illumina  <cit> , to automatically extract polymorphisms  and output them as a sequencelist file compatible with the illumina assay design tool  software  <cit> . the snp2illumina script also recorded for each polymorphism the number of sequences considered for the detection  and the minor allele frequency , two parameters that proved critical for high validation rate of est-derived snps  <cit> . the minimum detection depth was set to four. singletons were discarded in order to minimize the number of false positives, as it is highly unlikely to obtain sequencing errors twice at the same base location.

a from lepoittevin et al.  including  <dig> snps detected in  <dig> fragments from in vitro polymorphisms, set  <dig> 

finally, a set of in silico polymorphisms  was detected in the maritime pine est assembly. only the  <dig>  unigene elements containing at least four sequences were considered. the seqqual pipeline was also used to mask nucleotides with phred scores below  <dig>  and the snp2illumina script was used for automatic polymorphism detection .

snp selection for customized  <dig> -goldengate array construction
for the  <dig> -snps goldengate array design, we first included  <dig> snps previously validated on maritime pine aquitaine populations with the same genotyping technology  <cit> , including  <dig> in vitro polymorphisms from  <dig> of the  <dig> re-sequenced candidate gene fragments previously described, and  <dig> in silico snps detected in a maritime pine unigene assembly. for the additional  <dig>  snps, priority was given to in vitro polymorphisms. we only included polymorphisms showing designability score above  <dig> , which is the lower limit for genotyping success according to the manufacturer. this score is provided by adt software and is similar to a predicted probability of genotyping success, taking into account the sequence conformation around the snp and the lack of repetitive elements in the surrounding sequence  <cit> . following illumina's recommendation, the main technical constraint was that the selected polymorphisms should be separated by at least  <dig> nucleotides from each other. when several polymorphisms occurred within this limit, it was decided to filter out the lowest frequency variants and polymorphisms showing high level of linkage disequilibrium with other selected polymorphisms of the same fragment. finally, with the goal of mapping as many different loci as possible, emphasis was given to breath of coverage  versus depth of coverage . we used blastn analysis  <cit>  to ensure that in vitro and in silico polymorphisms belonged to different genes. we also blasted each amplicon to avoid including in the array members of the same gene family that had high homology in the sequence surrounding the target snp.

snp genotyping assay
genotyping of snps was carried out at the french national genotyping center  using the illumina goldengate assay according to the manufacturer's instructions . this assay is based on the use of  <dig> allele-specific and one locus-specific oligonucleotide per snp locus. after the step of allele specific extension and ligation, a pcr reaction is performed with universal primers labeled with either cy <dig> or cy <dig> dye to distinguish each snp allele. fluorescent products are hybridized to precoded beads on an array matrix. the fluorescent signals are read using the illumina bead array reader software. from the initial set of  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  were excluded by the cng quality control procedure, because of weak or ambiguous signal. the remaining  <dig>  snps  were individually inspected after visualization of the b allele frequency  versus the log r ratio  to screen out non-segregating markers in the studied pedigrees. for each snp, a homozygous genotype displays a signal in either the cy <dig> or cy <dig> channels, and a heterozygous genotype displays signals in both channels. the snps for which  <dig> or  <dig> scatter plots  were clearly identified, were classified as "polymorphic snps" . then, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> offspring were genotyped for the g <dig> and f <dig> mapping populations, respectively.

linkage mapping strategy
g <dig> map construction
linkage analysis was conducted using the "two-way pseudo-testcross" mapping strategy  <cit>  and independent linkage maps were constructed for each parental tree. polymorphic snp markers were classified into two categories according to their segregation proportions:  test-cross markers segregating 1/2: 1/ <dig>  or  inter-cross markers segregating 1/4: 1/2: 1/ <dig> . the polymorphic snps were combined with  <dig> other markers  available from previous studies  <cit> . mendelian segregation ratios were tested using χ2-square tests . linkage analyses and map estimations were performed with joinmap v  <dig>   <cit>  using cp  as population type. recombination frequencies were converted into map distances in centimorgans using the kosambi mapping function  <cit> . all available markers were first grouped at a minimum lod threshold of  <dig> . linkage groups  were named according to the nomenclature used for loblolly pine, as homologous lgs to this reference species were identified . once the different groups were determined, the female and male maps were built independently using the regression algorithm. the procedure is basically a process of building a map by adding loci one by one, starting from the most informative pair  <cit> . when using a high number of markers genotyped on a variable number of offspring, this procedure generally leads to the construction of  <dig> different maps with decreasing statistical support , indicating difficulties to reliably order markers within linkage groups. because the different types of markers were genotyped on different number of samples , we followed a framework mapping approach, where framework markers segregating 1/2: 1/ <dig>  were selected  and used as anchor points to localize poorer fitting loci . the relative position of each accessory marker to its most probable framework marker was then provided using the two-point lod scores and recombination fractions available in the "maximum linkage" table of joinmap.

total genome size, g, was estimated from hulbert et al.  <cit>  modified by chakravarti et al. , as g = /k in which n represents the number of framework markers in the map, x is the maximum observed map distance between two markers for which the expected value of lod score is z  and k is the observed number of locus pairs with lod score ≥ z.

f <dig> map construction
for the f <dig> pedigree, no previous marker data were available, therefore the map only relied on the snps segregating 1/4: 1/2: 1/ <dig> . linkage analysis was performed with joinmap v  <dig>  using f <dig> as population type and the regression algorithm. in many cases, all the markers belonging to a given lg were ordered with a minimum lod score of  <dig> , except for linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for which some markers had to be excluded  if the threshold lod score of  <dig>  was to be maintained . genome size was estimated as explained above, with n representing the number of unique framework snp markers.

consensus map construction
one of the objectives of this study was to construct a consensus map of the species based on snp markers. to this end, the two datasets  were combined assuming homogeneous recombination rates between the two studied populations and between the male and female linkage maps of the g <dig> mapping population . the construction of an integrated map required the estimation of a single recombination rate for each snp marker pair based on all available meioses, irrespective from which crosses the genotypic data had been derived. heterogeneity of recombination rate between snp marker pairs was tested between the two pedigrees using the "heterogeneity test" implemented in joinmap v  <dig> .

comparative mapping between maritime and loblolly pines
homology between loblolly  and maritime pine sequences, from which snps were derived for linkage mapping in maritime pine, was established using sequence similarity as assessed with megablast  <cit> . resequenced data from maritime pine were queried against the  <dig>  est contigs in loblolly pine, of which approximately 20% are located on its consensus linkage map. visual inspection of blast results was carried out to eliminate results due to small regions of homology , as was observed among different members of the same gene family. in this case, a small to moderate portion  of the maritime pine sequence was similar to multiple loblolly pine est contigs. these est contigs in loblolly pine also shared strong sequence homology  among themselves in the same region as the blast hit, suggesting that this region was conserved across paralogs. in these cases, the loci were excluded because orthology was difficult to establish.

this a posteriori approach yielded poor results . with the main goal of providing a priori a wider set of comparative anchor sequences  between the two most studied gymnosperm genera  we carried out the following bioinformatic analysis. the pine and spruce unigene datasets were downloaded from the tgi  version  <dig>  and  <dig>  with  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique sequences, respectively. single copy cos markers were detected using a two-step approach, starting with the filtering of paralogous sequences within genera, followed by the identification of conserved sequences between genera. in the first step, single copy genes within species were identified as follows:  each unigene was self-blastn against itself using parameters of word size  <dig>  penalty for a nucleotide mismatch - <dig>  reward for a nucleotide match  <dig>  filter off and the e_value < 1e- <dig> with megablast search,  we then used the tribemcl clustering algorithm  <cit>  to identify homolog sequences in each dataset. based on the tribemcl clustering result, we defined the sequence that did not form a gene family with other sequence as a singleton. in the second step, shared single-copy genes between pinus and picea were searched by joining singletons from both genera into one dataset and self-blastn using the same parameters as described above. alignments for which coverage was less than 60% of the shortest sequence and identity did not exceed 80% were removed. tribemcl clustering was then conducted on the post-processed blastn result to construct gene families. a cos marker was finally defined as a sequence presenting one single unigene from pinus and picea within the same family.

the cos marker dataset was finally searched against the maritime pine est assembly to identify the orthologous sequences in our dataset. in order to eliminate false-positive cos markers, the pine and spruce unigenes were searched against two plant protein databases using blastx: plaza  and ncbi non-redundant  protein database. cos markers were divided into five categories according to the presence or absence of hits in the queried databases, providing a range of confidence level in representing the cos markers: cos markers in category a display best hits either with plaza or ncbi nr protein databases; in category b, cos only hit in the ncbi nr protein database; for category c, cos are only found in the maritime pine unigene set; for category d, cos are only present in the pine and spruce tgi unigene; and in category e, cos most likely correspond to paralogs or to alternative splice events in the pine and spruce genome. thus, these five categories provide a range of sequence conservation and possible duplication history of cos markers .

RESULTS
snp array construction
a total of  <dig>  in vitro snps  and  <dig>  in silico snps were detected in the different data sets . about 61% of the in vitro snps had acceptable designability scores , as opposed to 33% for in silico snps. a  <dig>  goldengate snp array was built from the  <dig> snps  located in  <dig> different gene fragments previously validated in a goldengate array on the maritime pine aquitaine populations  <cit> , the  <dig> in vitro snps detected in either resequenced candidate genes  or in data from the crsp resequencing project , and, the  <dig> in silico snps detected in  <dig> contigs from the maritime pine est assembly. these  <dig>  snps were distributed in  <dig> non-redundant gene fragments or contigs.

snp genotyping statistics
out of the  <dig>  snps,  <dig> and  <dig> markers were classified as in vitro or in silico snps . the average sample success rate  was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the g <dig> and the f <dig> mapping populations, respectively. after the first screening step which excluded failed markers, a total of  <dig>  in vitro and  <dig>  in silico snps remained and were made available through the ncbi database . there was a statistical association between snp origin  and the proportion of failed snps, which was greater for in silico snps .

before the construction of the snp bead array, a designability score  was given to each snp by the illumina assay design tool. this score ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  with higher values reflecting greater ability to design a successful assay, and  <dig>  being the lowest threshold recommended by illumina to design the goldengate opa . in our study, the mean illumina snpscore for successfully genotyped snps  and failed snps were  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively, which indicates that  <dig> % of the successful and  <dig> % of the failed snps corresponded to illumina's recommendation . a chi-square test for independence confirmed earlier findings  <cit>  that there is a significant correlation between snpscore and the success rate for the conversion of a snp into a successful genotyping assay . we also found a higher proportion of snps with snpscore ≥  <dig>  for in vitro than for in silico snps , suggesting that failed assays for in silico snps were due, at least in part, to lower designability scores. this being said, it should be pointed out that several snps with relatively low snpscore  were still successful. a relaxed criterion could thus be attempted especially for those non model species for which few snps are available or for some snps in candidate genes of interest.

identification of informative snps
after visual inspection of successfully genotyped snps that allowed assignment of individual trees to their respective genotypic classes, we declared  <dig> and  <dig> polymorphic snps for the g <dig> and f <dig> mapping populations, respectively . the conversion rate, corresponding to the number of polymorphic snps divided by the total number of snps in the assay  <cit> , was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, for the g <dig> and f <dig> populations, respectively. a total of  <dig> snps were available for mapping. while  <dig> were pedigree specific,  <dig> snps were shared between both populations. in the g <dig> mapping population, there were  <dig> polymorphic in vitro snps  and  <dig> polymorphic in silico snps . in the f <dig> mapping population,  <dig> of the polymorphic snps came from the in vitro set  and  <dig> from the in silico set . there was no correlation between the snp origin and the proportion of polymorphic snps .

validation of the snp genotyping assay
the presence of several snps within the same amplicon  or contig  provided a unique opportunity to validate the genotyping assay by checking the inconsistency between offspring genotype assignments of physically linked snps. for the g <dig> population,  <dig> contigs presented more than one snp. from a total of  <dig>  data points we only detected  <dig> recombination events between snps belonging to the same contig, which translates to a genotyping error of  <dig> %, if we consider that the probability of crossover within a contig of a few hundred base pairs long is null. for the f <dig> population, there were  <dig> contigs containing more than one snp totalizing  <dig>  data points, from which  <dig> recombination events were observed . these results confirm the goldengate assay reproducibility in maritime pine as previously reported  <cit> .

construction of individual genetic linkage maps
for the g <dig> mapping population,  <dig>  out of  <dig> polymorphic snps were mapped with a lod ≥  <dig>  on the female and male parental maps . this map includes  <dig> markers segregating 1: <dig>  and  <dig> markers segregating in the 1:2: <dig> ratio. from these  <dig> shared markers,  <dig> were mapped on both parental maps. overall, these  <dig> snps represented  <dig> different contigs. for the f <dig> pedigree,  <dig> out of  <dig> polymorphic snps were mapped onto  <dig> lgs that aligned subsequently to the g <dig> lgs by using the  <dig> common markers between both pedigrees as anchor points. these  <dig> snps  represented  <dig> different contigs. the main features of the g <dig>  and f <dig> maps are summarized in table  <dig> 

comparative mapping between f <dig> and g <dig> linkage maps
a total of  <dig> snps  were mapped in both mapping populations. their distribution along the  <dig> lgs is shown in additional file  <dig>  and varies from  <dig> anchor marker for lg <dig> to  <dig> for lg <dig>  on average, homologous lgs between the f <dig> and g <dig> maps were assigned based on  <dig> common snps  per lg. marker order between the two maps was generally consistent when taking into account the regions covered by homologous markers . only six marker pairs showed significant heterogeneity in recombination rate at the 1% level, out of the  <dig> pairwise comparisons derived from snps simultaneously mapped in both populations, which is close to the number expected by chance alone. this result suggests that recombination fraction is homogeneous between the two studied populations, and that the consensus map is a reasonable approximation of the marker order that can be used for comparative mapping.

consensus map construction
when the three individual maps were merged into a single consensus map,  <dig> snps  were mapped onto  <dig> lgs, with a minimum of  <dig> snps in lg <dig> and a maximum of  <dig> snps in lg <dig>  the  <dig> consensus lgs covered a distance of  <dig>  cm, with a length ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> cm, and the distance between adjacent markers  averaging  <dig> cm. the marker order was generally well conserved between the individual and consensus maps.

genome size estimation
observed map lengths ranged from  <dig> cm for the f <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm for the g <dig> male and female maps, respectively. estimated genome sizes computed for different statistical support for linkage  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm for the g <dig> female map, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm for the g <dig> male map, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm for the f <dig> map, with an average of  <dig>  cm. given a physical size of  <dig>  pg/2c  <cit> ,  <dig> cm would correspond to  <dig>  mb/cm on average.

comparative mapping between maritime and loblolly pines
based on a stringent sequence homology search between the  <dig> mapped contigs in maritime pine  and the  <dig>  mapped contigs in loblolly pine ,  <dig> cos markers were identified, from which  <dig> made it possible to align  <dig> linkage groups  between both species maps with at least  <dig> orthologous markers. in four cases, there were inconsistencies in the linkage group assignments of snp markers, which could be attributed to paralogy rather than to alternative splice events, as they were found in different linkage groups. taking into account the est-p markers that were already identified as anchor points between these two species  <cit> , all linkage groups are now aligned. figure  <dig> shows an example of homologous linkage groups between loblolly and maritime pines anchored by  <dig> cos markers . overall, the total number of anchor loci amounts to  <dig> markers.

identification of cos markers between pinus and picea
a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  single-copy genes from pine and spruce tgi unigenes were identified in the first clustering attempt. a second attempt, with more stringent blastn filtering parameters, resulted into  <dig>  cos markers , that were split into five categories:   <dig>  cos markers presenting a best hit either with plant or ncbi nr protein database,   <dig> cos markers showing a hit only with the ncbi nr database,   <dig> cos markers with no hit with both protein databases but showing at least one homolog with the maritime pine dataset,   <dig> cos markers only present in the pine or spruce tgi unigenes, and   <dig> cos markers potentially corresponding to duplicated genes within the pine or spruce genomes. markers in the first class should be considered as the main target for further development in view of comparative genomic surveys in conifers.

discussion
genotyping assay
the global success rate  obtained for the snp array developed in the present study was  <dig> %. this result is similar to that achieved for a 384-goldengate snp array on the same species . such similar success rate indicates that higher multiplex levels of goldengate arrays do not affect the assay's effectiveness. however, the success rate was statistically different between in vitro  and in silico  snps. there are many causes of genotyping failures in est-derived snps  <cit> . first, in est sequences, sequencing errors can lead to the identification of false-positives. in the present study this factor was however minimized by setting a minimum detection depth of  <dig> sequences for in silico snps and by removing singletons. second, low quality of snp flanking sequences, non-identified polymorphisms nearby the targeted snp and the possible presence of exon-intron junctions close to targeted polymorphic sites can also lead to genotyping failures. screening for phred scores above  <dig> allowed coping with the former source of failure, while the two latter were controlled for in vitro polymorphisms only and may have contributed to the observed difference in success rate. finally, as indicated by shirasawa et al.  <cit> , failed snps may be designed on multi copy genes and may disrupt the fluorescent signal cluster on the analysis software. because in vitro snps were obtained from single copy locus , in silico snps were certainly affected to a greater extent by this problem.

the conversion rate  in this study was  <dig> % for the g <dig> and  <dig> % for the f <dig> mapping populations. we did not find statistical differences in terms of percentage of polymorphic snps between in vitro and in silico derived snps. in fact, snps were not a priori screened for their polymorphism in the mapping pedigrees, which resulted in a relatively low percentage of polymorphic markers. these figures are quite similar to those obtained by jermstad et al.  <cit>  for two sugar pine mapping populations, which had a conversion rate of  <dig> % and  <dig> %. on the other hand, higher snp conversion rates  were obtained by resequencing amplicons of parental lines of mapping populations of white and black spruce, respectively  <cit> . such an approach is thus an efficient method for tracking informative snps for linkage analyses  <cit> .

consensus linkage map and genome size  estimation
the genome size of pinus pinaster was first estimated from low coverage protein based linkage maps by gerber and rodolphe  <cit>  who obtained sizes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm depending on the method and the data set used. later on, echt and nelson  <cit>  narrowed down this estimate to  <dig> - <dig>  cm with an extended marker dataset. in the present study, genome size was estimated for two other mapping populations and three different lod score thresholds following method  <dig> of chakravarti et al.  <cit> . on average, our genome size estimate amounted  <dig>  cm, which is higher than earlier reports on the same species but in the range of estimates obtained for other pines from partial linkage data:  <dig>  cm for pinus sylvestris  <cit> ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm for pinus palustris  <cit>  and  <dig>  cm for pinus contorta subsp. latifolia  <cit> .

comparing genome size estimates between three species, pinus pinaster, pinus strobus and pinus palustris, echt and nelson  <cit>  showed that pines have similar genome lengths, suggesting a highly conserved genomic rate of recombination across species. the differences in genome size estimations observed in the literature may be due to the choice of the mapping function and to variations in the recombination rates of pollen and seed parents  <cit> . furthermore, the use of different methods to estimate genome size, such as method  <dig> of hulbert et al.  <cit>  or method  <dig> modified by chakravarti et al.  <cit>  can also bias the estimations  <cit> , while discrepancies can also be produced by either genotyping errors that inflate the hulbert genome size estimator and/or the non-random clustering of markers such as aflps  <cit> .

in the present study, a consensus map of maritime pine was generated from segregation data obtained in full-sib  and selfed  populations. the integrated map provided the relative position of  <dig> framework and unique snps, as well as additional  <dig> markers . the consensus map comprised  <dig> markers in total, with two adjacent markers spaced by  <dig> cm on average. with these parameters, we estimated, the coverage of maritime pine genome using the formula: c = 1-e-2dn/l  <cit> , with c representing the proportion of the genome within d cm of a marker, where l is the estimated genome length and n is the number of markers. assuming a random distribution of markers, a genome size of  <dig>  cm and an average marker spacing of  <dig> cm, the estimated proportion of the maritime pine genome covered by our analysis was  <dig> %. in order to evaluate the number of markers needed to cover 95% of the expected maritime pine genome , we used an additional formula developed by lange and boehnke  <cit> , i.e. n = , where n is the minimum number of randomly distributed markers needed to cover a proportion p, of a genome size k, at a maximum distance of 2c between two adjacent markers. we estimated that  <dig> and  <dig> markers were necessary to cover 95% of the genome with a maximum distance of  <dig> or  <dig> cm between markers, respectively.

the consensus map was comprised of  <dig> linkage groups, while the haploid number of chromosomes for pinus is  <dig>  however, the  <dig> markers mapped are not far away from the number of markers expected to cover 95% of the genome for a maximum distance of  <dig> cm between markers. this suggests that the markers are probably not distributed randomly along the genome and that more markers should be needed to saturate the map. as suggested by sewell et al.  <cit> , the gaps between the split linkage groups belonging to the same unit may represent a non-random sampling of the genome resulting from an under-representation of markers from these regions. li and yeh  <cit>  indicated that small pedigree size and low linkage information content can also cause undetected linkages when a small number of genetic markers are used. when a large number of markers are used, unresolved linkages can be observed because markers are clustered into large regions separated by several gaps. in the present study, the consensus map integrated linkage data of only  <dig> shared snp loci from two mapping populations of about  <dig> offsprings, the  <dig> other snps segregating in only one pedigree. in order to fill in the gaps between split linkage groups and thus saturate the consensus map, we should increase the sample size  and the number of anchor markers between mapping populations.

comparative mapping between loblolly and maritime pines and resource development for comparative genomics in conifers
comparative mapping consists of studying the conservation of gene content  and order  in the genome of related species and allows inferring chromosome evolution and transferring genetic information between species. comparisons are generally made by detecting orthologous loci through sequences homology or conserved map regions  <cit> . loblolly pine has emerged as a reference species for comparative mapping in the pinaceae  <cit> . comparative mapping was already investigated between p. taeda and other pinus species using putatively orthologous markers  <cit> . macro-synteny was also reported between maritime and loblolly pines  <cit>  and  <dig> shared est-ps made it possible to identify  <dig> homologous lgs. in the present study, we made an a posteriori search for additional orthologous loci between markers mapped on loblolly and maritime pines. we identified  <dig> putative cos markers of which  <dig> showed multiple parallel linkages between  <dig> linkage groups; the remaining  <dig> cos markers mapped in non orthologous linkage groups, thus suggesting that they belonged to different members of the same gene families. altogether,  <dig> cos markers  allowed alignment of all  <dig> homologous linkage groups between both pine species. macro-synteny and macro-colinearity were generally well conserved, but some inconsistencies in the marker order within lgs were observed. such inconsistencies can be attributed either to different members of gene families with different map positions within the same lg, or to the low resolution of the marker order in the consensus map, because of a low number of anchor loci. to ensure that future comparative mapping studies will rely on an a priori defined set of orthologous markers instead of defining orthology between mapped markers a posteriori, we have provided a set of cos markers between the two most economically important conifer genera pinus and picea.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates the usefulness of highly multiplexed snp genotyping arrays to rapidly generate informative molecular markers showing mendelian segregation in different mapping pedigrees and to establish the first snp-based genetic linkage map in non-model species such as maritime pine. the genotyping of five other maritime pine mapping populations is underway and will allow us to create a more precise and denser consensus map for this species. the sequencing of parental lines of these mapping pedigrees has recently been carried out using 454-roche sequencing to extend the set of informative snps . crossing this extended set of snps to the cos markers identified in this study will provide new resources for high resolution comparative genomics at the dawn of the first conifer full-genome sequences.
