BACKGROUND
as a tool for genetic research and breeding, genetic linkage maps have been widely used to discover the position and to clone genes controlling biotic and abiotic stress resistance, agronomic and seed quality traits and to facilitate marker-assisted selection of the traits with low heritability and/or high phenotyping cost. in soybean, the first molecular genetic linkage map was reported in  <dig>  <cit> . the map contained  <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers that were mapped using an f <dig> population with  <dig> progeny derived from a cross of a81- <dig>  × pi <dig> . subsequently, a map with  <dig> rflps was constructed based on an f <dig> population with  <dig> progeny from a cross of minsoy × noir  <dig>  <cit> , and a map with  <dig> rflps,  <dig> random amplified polymorphic dna  markers and  <dig> amplified fragment length polymorphisms  based on  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  from pi437654 × bsr <dig>  <cit>  were reported. the early genetic linkage maps were primarily based on rflp or aflp markers and due to the lack of polymorphism or the complexity of the multiple banding patterns with these markers, simple sequence repeat  or microsatellite markers were proposed and then evaluated for the construction of genetic linkage maps  <cit> . cregan et al.   <cit>  developed three separate linkage maps containing a total of  <dig> markers including  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> rflps,  <dig> rapds and  <dig> other markers. these markers were mapped using three ril populations: the minsoy × noir  <dig> population with  <dig> rils, the a81-356022 × pi <dig> population with 57 f <dig> plants, and the clark × harosoy population with 59 f <dig> plants and resulted in  <dig> linkage groups which were assumed to correspond to the  <dig> pairs of soybean chromosomes. song et al.   <cit>  constructed an integrated soybean linkage map using the three mapping populations used by cregan et al.   <cit>  as well as two additional mapping populations from minsoy × archer with  <dig> rils, and archer × noir  <dig> with  <dig> rils. the consensus map contained  <dig> markers including  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> rflps,  <dig> rapds and  <dig> other markers  <cit> . as large numbers of expressed sequence tags  and genomic sequence became available in later years, choi et al.   <cit>  discovered > <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  markers by comparing dna sequences acquired from a set of diverse genotypes after pcr amplification and sequence analysis of the est or genomic sequences. a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> snps were mapped using three mapping populations including the minsoy × noir  <dig> with  <dig> rils, minsoy × archer with  <dig> rils as well as the evans × pi  <dig> with <dig> rils  <cit> . hyten et al.   <cit>  added  <dig> additional snps to the linkage maps created by choi et al.   <cit>  using the same minsoy × noir  <dig>  minsoy × archer and evans × peking populations  <cit> . all of the molecular markers on these linkage maps were developed before the soybean whole genome sequence was available, thus, the markers were not evenly distributed and did not sufficiently cover all of the genomic regions of the soybean genome with a total sequence length >1100 mb  <cit> .

the williams  <dig> glyma <dig>  whole genome sequence was completed and published in  <dig>  <cit> . the genome sequence is widely used for the study of gene structure , syntenic relationships among legume species , identification of genes , the development of additional molecular markers and for other uses. song et al.   <cit>  identified  <dig>  snps by mapping short reads from each of eight soybean accessions which included six cultivated  merr.) and two wild soybean  genotypes and selected  <dig>  snps for the design of the soysnp50k illumina infinium beadchip  <cit> . the beadchip has been successfully used to genotype the entire usda soybean germplasm collection containing  <dig>  accessions including  <dig> wild and  <dig>  cultivated soybean accessions  <cit> , the dataset is available at soybase, the usda, ars soybean genetics and genomics database, http://www.soybase.org/snps/download.php) and is being used for genome-wide association analysis , quantitative trait loci  analysis  <cit> , genetic diversity analysis and the identification of regions associated with domestication and selection imposed by modern breeding. in addition, song et al.   <cit>  identified a total of  <dig>  ssrs with di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats of five or more in the soybean whole genome sequence which included  <dig>  ssrs consisting of repeat units of di- , tri- , and tetranucleotide , and developed a database  of locus-specific ssr markers with a high likelihood of polymorphism. a database with the primer sequences and their genome positions for  <dig>  ssrs in the glyma <dig>  assembly was created  <cit> . the database also included the physical positions of  <dig> snps in the glyma <dig>  build, which were mapped by hyten et al.   <cit> . these molecular markers plus the markers developed previously  are being used by researchers in the soybean community. however, with the updating of the glyma <dig>  build based on the high-resolution linkage maps resulting from this research, the genome positions of these markers need to be redefined.

the glyma <dig>  build captured approximately 975 mb of sequence across the  <dig> chromosomes. the glyma <dig>  whole genome sequence contained  <dig> unanchored scaffolds with lengths ranging from  <dig> to 100 kb and  <dig> unanchored scaffolds with lengths greater than 100 kb. the assembly was basically built based on the integrated linkage maps  <cit>  and a genetic map with additional markers specifically selected to aid in the pseudomolecule assembly  <cit> . however, the marker density on any one of these linkage maps was still insufficient to fully cover all regions of the soybean genome. in addition, the number of rils genotyped for the construction of the previous linkage maps was relatively small   <cit> . these deficiencies may result in low resolution, large gaps, and incorrect marker order in the linkage maps, and in turn, may cause incorrect orientation or misplacement of scaffolds in the glyma <dig>  whole genome sequence assembly of soybean.

the objectives of this research were to construct high resolution linkage maps using large mapping populations, to identify misplaced or incorrectly orientated genomic regions, to anchor additional scaffolds in the glyma <dig>  assembly, and to position ssr and snp markers in the wm <dig> a <dig> v1assembly.

RESULTS
construction of high resolution linkage maps
a total of  <dig>  snps were polymorphic among  <dig> rils in the williams  <dig> x pi <dig>  and  <dig>  snps among the  <dig> rils in the essex x williams  <dig>  population. after elimination of snps with missing >10 % or segregation distortion significant at the 1 % level based on χ <dig> tests,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps were mapped in the wp, ew and wp + ew populations, respectively. the number of mapped snps in each linkage group ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in the wp, 132– <dig> in the ew and 938– <dig> in the wp + ew populations. the total genetic linkage map distance was  <dig>  cm in the wp and  <dig>  cm in the ew population .table  <dig> number of snps mapped to each linkage group, linkage group length based on the williams 82 × pi <dig>  and the essex × williams  <dig>  populations and the number of snps common to the two populations and snps unique to one population



identification of misassembled genomic regions or anchorable scaffolds in glyma <dig> 
of the  <dig>  snps mapped in wp and  <dig>  in ew,  <dig> snps were present in both populations and the number of common snps per chromosome ranged from  <dig> on chromosome gm <dig> to  <dig> on chromosome gm <dig>  marker order on the genetic linkage maps was used to identify major genomic regions of the glyma <dig>  that required reorientation and/or re-positioning. analysis showed that the order of the common markers on the two linkage maps was highly consistent and the order of the snps was generally consistent with their physical positions along the corresponding chromosomes of glyma <dig>  . however, there were  <dig> regions or single markers that required re-positioning or reorientation based upon marker orders supported by both the wp and ew mapping data . in these regions, the snp markers had consistent order along the linkage maps in both mapping populations but their order was not consistent with physical position in glyma <dig> . for example, there were regions on gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig> and gm <dig> where the order of snps on both linkage maps was identical, but the order of those snps in the glyma <dig>  assembly was reversed . in addition, a number of individual markers or sets of markers identified sequence that was placed on the wrong chromosome . there were a total of  <dig> regions that required re-positioning or reorientation based upon marker orders available from either the wp or ew mapping data . in addition,  <dig> unanchored scaffolds with a total length of  <dig>  mb in glyma <dig>  were anchored as a result of markers in either the wp or ew map, or both, that defined the scaffold genome position .table  <dig> regions or single markers in glyma <dig>  that required re-positioning or reorientation based upon marker orders supported by both or either the w <dig> x pi <dig> and/or the essex x w <dig> mapping data



the wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> assembly
based on the two dense linkage maps and additional analyses, sequence breaks from glyma <dig>  were identified and reassembled. the new build of the  <dig> chromosomes captured  <dig>  mb. the total sequence including the  <dig> unmapped scaffolds was  <dig>  mb. the plots of the genetic on physical distance of the snps in glyma <dig>  and wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> showed that major regions, such as on gm <dig> and gm <dig> with an inconsistent order of snps on linkage maps vs. physical position in the glyma <dig>  build were corrected in the wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> assembly . further comparison of the physical positions of the snps in glyma <dig>  vs. wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> showed that sequence assembly errors in the regions indicated in table  <dig> and table  <dig> were all corrected in wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> . in addition, a total of  <dig> scaffolds with mapped snp markers were anchored to the new build. the new assembly which is completed at the department of energy, joint genome institute is available at http://www.phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html.

based upon the plots of genetic distance on physical distance of the snps in wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> and mapped in either the wp or ew population, the regions with high and low recombination rate were defined. these plots allowed the delimitation of the approximate positions of euchromatic and heterochromatic regions along each chromosome . the two regions covered approximately 43 % and 47 % of the total estimated genome sequence, respectively.table  <dig> approximate positions of heterochromatic and euchromatic regions in the wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> whole genome sequence



positions of commonly used markers in the wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> assembly
of the  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig> snps in the barcsoyssr_ <dig>  database,  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig> snps were unambiguously positioned in the wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> assembly. a total of  <dig> snps and  <dig> ssrs were in the genes defined in wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> and the total number of unique genes in which these ssr and snp markers resided was  <dig> .

among the  <dig>  snps originally selected for inclusion in the soysnp50k beadchip  <cit> ,  <dig>  snps were positioned in the new assembly and a total of  <dig>  snps were in  <dig>  different genes. the positions of  <dig> snps in the wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> assembly could not be determined .

discussion
the two linkage maps created in this study have the highest density of markers and are based on the largest number of recombinant inbred lines that have been reported in soybean to date. simulation studies indicated that a low number of rils in a population frequently caused inversions of marker order and breakage in linkage groups and that the precision of the maps is highly dependent on the number of rils  <cit> . for the purpose of integrating large numbers of markers into a linkage map, the wp population which was derived from the cross of cultivated by wild soybean accessions was developed. the large genetic divergence between the two subspecies allowed us to identify and map large numbers of snps in a single population. one concern with the linkage maps from g. max x g. soja was the possibility of paracentric inversions and reciprocal translocations between the cultivated soybean and certain wild soybean accessions  <cit> . however, we did not observe such regions in the linkage maps of wp based on the order of approximately  <dig> common snps mapped in both the wp and ew populations.

besides the number of markers and size of the ril populations, utilization of evenly distributed markers across the whole soybean genome was also essential to ensure maps with high resolution. the snps in the soysnp50k beadchip were carefully selected in order to equalize the distance between selected snps in the euchromatic and heterochromatic regions along each chromosome and the beadchip was able to generate high quality genotyping data  <cit> . the resulting two linkage maps had better coverage and higher resolution than any other soybean linkage maps reported previously. the high quality of the two linkage maps is supported by the very consistent order of the common markers in the two maps.

even though the glyma <dig>  build was well constructed, we identified regions where the marker physical order was inconsistent with the wp and ew linkage maps. most of these regions either had insufficient marker numbers or lacked markers with recombination in the previous linkage maps  <cit>  on which the glyma <dig>  assembly was based. the misassembled or improperly oriented regions identified by our linkage maps covered all of the major regions reported by lee et al.   <cit>  and the regions were moved or re-assembled in the wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> assembly. of course, refinement of some regions may still be required especially in the heterochromatic regions where limited recombination was observed.

in order to determine the approximate positions of the euchromatic and heterochromatic regions of the genome, the cumulative genetic distances  were plotted against their corresponding cumulative physical distance  via the mapped snp loci positions on the genetic linkage map and their genome sequence position along each chromosome. the region between the two inflection points of the cumulative genetic distance against cumulative physical distance on the plot was defined as the heterochromatic region  <cit> . the reliability of defining heterochromatic regions using this method was validated by the conventional  <dig> -diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining method in rice  <cit> .

because of the many reports of genes/qtl in the soybean genome positioned using ssr or snp markers, the corresponding physical position of the molecular markers in the new assembly vs. the older assembly is frequently requested by users. we identified physical positions for almost all of the markers in the barcsoyssr_ <dig>  database and the soysnp50k beadchip in the wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> vs. the glyma <dig>  assemblies. the updated information is anticipated to facilitate the identification of molecular markers in desired positions of the genome and make the ssr and snp databases more user-friendly.

CONCLUSIONS
two high density genetic linkage maps of soybean based on  <dig>  snp loci mapped in the g. max x g. soja population with  <dig> recombinant inbred lines and  <dig>  snp loci mapped in the g. max x g. max population with  <dig> rils were constructed. the maps contained the highest number of markers and were constructed based on the largest mapping populations in soybean to date. with the high density genetic linkage maps, false joins or mis-placed scaffolds and unanchored scaffolds in the first version of the soybean whole-genome sequence assembly  were identified and the corresponding scaffolds were broken or reassembled to a new wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> assembly which is available at the site http://www.phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html/ of the department of energy, joint genome institute. in addition, the euchromatic and heterochromatic regions along each chromosome of the soybean were delimited and the positions of commonly used soybean ssr and snp markers were determined based on the wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig> assembly. the information will facilitate the genetic and genomics research in soybean.
