BACKGROUND
so-called amoeba-resistant bacteria are characterized by the ability to survive within free-living amoeba  trophozoites  <cit> . some amoeba-resistant species have been further demonstrated to survive within the amoebal cyst which may act as a "trojan horse" protecting the organisms from adverse environmental conditions  <cit> . the amoebal cyst is comprised of the nucleus and the cytoplasm embedded into three successive layers, i.e. the endocyst, the clear region and the outer exocyst. despite the fact that specific location of amoeba-resistant bacteria into the amoebal cyst could modify the outcome of the organisms, precise location of intracystic organisms has not been systematically studied.

most of environmental mycobacteria have been demonstrated to be amoeba-resistant organisms also residing into the amoebal cyst  <cit>  . the mycobacterium avium complex  organisms have been used as model organisms for environmental mycobacteria, comprising of mycobacteria that are responsible for opportunistic infections and zoonoses  <cit> . m. avium and mycobacterium intracellulare have been recovered from various sources, including fresh water  <cit>  and hospital water supplies, in which fla are frequently isolated  <cit> . several experimental studies have further demonstrated m. avium-fla interactions, including acanthamoeba spp.  <cit>  and dictyostelium spp.  <cit> . m. avium and m. intracellulare have also been grown in the ciliated, unicellular protist tetrahymena pyriformis  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that m. avium subsp. avium and m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis are able to survive within fla  <cit> , which results in their increased virulence  <cit>  and protection against adverse situations including exposure to antibiotics  <cit> . the habitat of the recently described mycobacterium chimaera , isolated from respiratory tract specimens  <cit> ; mycobacterium colombiense , isolated from the blood of an hiv-positive patient  <cit>  and from enlarged lymph nodes in non-immunocompromised children  <cit> ;mycobacterium arosiense isolated from bone lesions  <cit> ; and mycobacterium marseillense, mycobacterium timonense and mycobacterium bouchedurhonense isolated from respiratory tract specimens  <cit> , remains however unknown. mac species exhibit on-going evolutionary divergence as evidenced by the  <dig> - <dig> % ani  between the genomes of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis k <dig>  and m. avium strain  <dig> , the  <dig> % 16s rrna gene divergence between m. avium and m. timonense and between m. avium and m. chimaera, and the  <dig> % rpob gene sequence divergence between m. avium and m. colombiense  <cit> .

using optic microscopy, electron microscopy and culturing methods, we herein used the mac species as model organisms to study the location of environmental mycobacteria into the amoebal cyst and we further compared these observations with previously published data to find out that residing into the exocyst is a unique characteristic of environmental mycobacteria among amoeba-resistant organisms.

RESULTS
the  <dig> mac strains  studied survived, but did not grow, after a 24-hour incubation in page's modified neff's amoeba saline  at 32°c. microscopic examination of infected amoeba demonstrated that all mac organisms were entrapped in a. polyphaga trophozoites and were visible in 3- to 5-μm large "mycobacterium containing vacuoles" as early as  <dig> hours post-infection;  <dig> to  <dig> such vacuoles were observed per infected amoeba . the mean number of "mycobacterium containing vacuoles" was not statistically different between the various mac species. electron microscopy observations revealed that, in the "mycobacterium containing vacuoles" containing only one organism, there was a close apposition of the vacuole membrane all over the mycobacterial cell surface , which was tightly apposed all over the organism cell wall, in contrast to organisms in vacuoles that contained several organisms as previously described in macrophages  <cit> . in this study, we did not resolved whether the presence of several mycobacteria within one vacuole resulted from the uptake of clumped mycobacteria, the replication of mycobacteria or the coalescence of several, single-organism vacuoles remains undetermined. in any case, our observations agree with previous studies that m. avium is initially entrapped in the vacuoles of amoebal trophozoites  <cit>  and macrophages  <cit>  . in dictyostelium, m. avium accumulated within vacuoles decorated with vacuolin, the dictyostelium flotilin homologue, but it did not break the vacuole membrane, in contrast to mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium marinum. this result was linked to the absence of a particular region of difference , which in m. tuberculosis and m. marinum, encodes a type seven secretion system along with secreted effectors  <cit> .

electron microscopy further disclosed that the  <dig> mac strains under study were entrapped inside of the a. polyphaga cysts . in all cases, the intracystic organisms were localized within the exocyst. in addition, m. marseillense could be observed in the clear region between the exocyst and the endocyst and in the inner side of the endocyst, and this was also the situation for m. intracellulare  . we further observed that a 36-hour exposure of the cysts to hcl did not affect the viability of the cysts, as new trophozoites emerged after 7-day incubation in peptone yeast extract-glucose  media at 32°c as determined by light microscopy. sub-culturing such trophozoites on middlebrook 7h <dig> agar yielded mycobacteria for all of the  <dig> mac species  under study after a 15-day incubation, whereas the cyst washing fluid remained sterile. interestingly, we observed that these mycobacteria occupied a preferential location within the amoebal exocyst, where they were found in-between the two layers of the exocyst. among the several mycobacterium species reported to survive within amoebal cysts, such a particular feature has been previously illustrated only for m. avium in a. polyphaga cysts  <cit> ; m. smegmatis  <cit> ; m. abscessus, m. chelonae and m. septicum  <cit> ; and m. xenopi  <cit> . among intra-amoebal bacteria, location within the exocyst has also been reported for simkania negevensis  <cit> , despite the fact that s. negevensis organisms could also be observed within the cytoplasm of the cyst, depending on the strain under study  <cit> . location within exocyst wall contrasts with the observation of legionella pneumophila, which was found within the cytoplasm of pre-cysts and mature cysts of a. polyphaga  <cit>  or non-entrapped within amoebal cysts  <cit> . reviewing published data regarding amoebal-resistant bacterial species  <cit>  found that 11/ <dig>  mycobacterium species versus 1/ <dig>  non-mycobacterium amoebal-resistant bacterial species have been reported to survive within a. polyphaga exocyst  . as both l. pneumophila and mycobacteria are pathogens, the intracystic location of organisms may not influence their virulence. the mechanisms and biological significance of this particular location remain to be studied. it has been established that a. polyphaga exocyst is composed of cellulose  <cit>  and the authors have observed that mycobacteria encode one cellulose-binding protein and one or two cellulases which are indeed transcribed  <cit> . cellulase encoded by mycobacteria may play a role in their unique exocyst location.

moreover, we observed that all mac species can survive within such a. polyphaga cyst. this occurrence did not merely result from the potential contamination of the amoeba by extra-amoebal mycobacteria, since we destroyed any mac organism left on the surface of cysts by incubating the cysts in hcl, a method previously demonstrated to kill remaining trophozoites, immature cysts and extra-amoebal m. avium  <cit> . we checked the efficacy of this process by incubating the rinsing buffer on middlebrook and found no growth of mycobacteria, which indicated that the hcl had indeed destroyed any extracystic mac organisms. the fact that all of the mac species survived in the exocyst may be relevant to the persistence of these organisms in the environment despite adverse conditions. non-tuberculous mycobacteria, including m. avium, have been shown to persist up to  <dig> months in drinking water systems despite filtration and ozonation  <cit> . also, m. intracellulare and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria have been shown to be protected against  <dig> mg/liter of free-chlorine for  <dig> hours by entrapment within a. polyphaga cysts  <cit> . therefore, free-living amoeba cysts may be a "trojan horse" for mac organisms and protect them from adverse environmental conditions, including high concentrations of chlorine, as previously reported for other environmental mycobacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented herein on mac species illustrate that survival within the amoebal exocyst is a significant feature of environmental mycobacteria. this particular location, preserving mycobacteria from adverse environment, nevertheless allow them to rapidly escape from the amoebal cyst. the mechanisms for such unique location remain to be established in environmental mycobacteria.
