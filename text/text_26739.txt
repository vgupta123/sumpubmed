BACKGROUND
recently, clusters of enhancers termed stretch- or super-enhancers  were identified as large cis-acting elements in the genome that uniquely regulate cell lineage-specific gene transcription and define cell identity  <cit> . ses are characterized by potent transcriptional enhancer activity that correlates with high occupancy by transcription factors  and co-activators, and pronounced sensitivity to perturbation  <cit> . additionally, non-coding disease-associated genetic variation is enriched in ses  <cit> . to identify ses, the binding density of med <dig>  a subunit of the transcriptional mediator protein complex, was originally used  <cit> . similarly, brd <dig>  a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal  family of transcriptional coactivators that interact with mediator, can also be used to identify ses  <cit> .

since ses are central to cell identity, they may help find factors for direct reprogramming of cells, or identify drug targets to treat diseases. we explore this latter notion by analyzing p <dig> density at enhancer sites in cell transition states. pioneering studies have demonstrated that chromatin immuno-precipitation followed by deep sequencing  can reliably measure binding of p <dig>  a histone acetyltransferase and transcription activator, across the genome to predictively map transcriptional enhancer elements active in vivo .

although ses have been shown to regulate cell identity genes in resting steady state, the role of ses in regulating transition states such as cell differentiation and activation is not well appreciated. several epiblast stem cell ses have been reported to arise from ‘seed’ enhancers in embryonic stem cells  <cit> , however this observation has not been analyzed systematically in other cell types. since these transition states are frequently targeted in therapies for inflammatory disease and cancer, we characterized the dynamic regulation of enhanceosome assembly using the well known transcriptional co-activator protein p <dig>  first, we establish p <dig> as a reliable mark of ses, then show that high-density p <dig> ses are induced in cell transition states and are located near cell identity and disease susceptibility genes.

we also find that non-coding transcription is often associated with ses. long non-coding rnas , which associate with chromatin modifying complexes and play roles in gene expression regulation either in cis or trans  <cit> , are much more likely to be located in proximity to ses than conventional enhancers . lncrnas are rna transcripts greater than  <dig> base pairs in length, and are often spliced and polyadenylated. a category of non-coding rnas arising from enhancer regions, known as enhancer rnas , participate in enhancer activity and regulate neighboring genes  <cit> . these erna transcripts often lack polyadenylation, as well as the typical h3k4me <dig> promoter signature present in the loci for other classes of lncrna genes  <cit> . here, we show that some ernas are coincident with some se regions.

finally, we found that the tlr <dig> stimulated inflammatory response led to drastic remodeling of ses in macrophages. many se-associated genes are highly induced, suggesting that inflammation can be targeted by blocking ses. small molecule bet inhibitors effectively disable ses in tumor cell lines and stop cell growth  <cit> , and we show that chemical inhibitors that abrogate se function also block expression of inflammatory genes, as well as affect cell fate decisions in macrophages and t helper cells.

RESULTS
characterization of p300-marked super-enhancers
p <dig>  also known as e1a-binding protein,  <dig> kd , has been previously used to identify enhancers , and it was recently suggested that p <dig> may also mark ses  <cit> . to determine whether p <dig> can be used to identify ses, we analyzed p <dig>  med <dig>  and h3k27ac chip-seq data in mouse embryonic stem cells . we found that p <dig> is especially dense at previously reported se sites, including the important pluripotency genes pou5f <dig> and sox <dig> . when enhancers were ranked by density, p <dig> had a similar distribution plot to med <dig> and h3k27ac, recovering 88 %  of med <dig> ses . there is a high correlation of p <dig> and med <dig> at these shared sites . the non-coding pvt <dig> gene neighboring myc that harbors a se was recently shown to contribute to high expression of this locus in cancer cells  <cit> . a p300-marked se overlaps this locus, and may contribute to its expression in mescs . genes near ses are highly expressed in mescs relative to genes associated with conventional enhancers   and all expressed genes on average  . we also observed that ses are closer to transcription start sites than ces are, on average, and it is possible that this property is related to the increased gene expression associated with ses . furthermore, ses are large on average, as expected . in the examples that we show, the p <dig> ses are co-bound by oct <dig>  nanog, and sox <dig> , which has been reported to be a feature of ses in general in mescs  <cit> .fig.  <dig> identification of p <dig> dense super-enhancers. a ranked distribution plot of p <dig>  med <dig>  or h3k27ac binding density identifies a small subset of ses  in mouse escs. venn diagram  shows the overlap between p <dig>  med <dig>  and h3k27ac marked ses. chip-seq data are from  <cit> . b genome browser screenshot depicting mesc rna-seq and chip-seq data as labeled.  the myc gene is adjacent to pvt <dig>  a lncrna overlapping with a se identified by p <dig>  med <dig> and h3k27ac.  oct <dig> is encoded by the pou5f <dig> locus which harbors a se marked by p <dig>  med <dig>  and h3k27ac. in addition, p <dig> co-localizes with the core pluripotency factors oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog in both cases. c expression of genes near p <dig> ses and ces. genes that are located within 100 kb of a se are expressed at higher levels than those near a ce, and all expressed genes. d  chia-pet reveals that a p <dig> se loops ~100 kb to physically associate with the promoter  of the esc-specific l1td <dig> gene.  chromatin interaction between a se and a gene highly expressed in mescs, epha <dig>  chia-pet data are from  <cit>  and depicted as grey lines with blue ends. e in mescs,  <dig> additional ses were identified from p <dig> density than from med <dig> density. igf2bp <dig> is shown as an example of a p300-specific se . in contrast, there are only  <dig> ses identified by med <dig> in mescs but not by p <dig>  for example, a med1-specific se near the gene macf <dig> is shown . there are two ses in close vicinity to macf1; both were identified as ses by med <dig>  while only one qualified as a se by p300



p <dig> ses participate in long-range chromatin interactions by looping to promoters , a known mechanism of action for transcriptional enhancers and ses  <cit> . for example, we show such an interaction between the promoter of a stem cell self-renewal gene l1td <dig>  <cit>  and a se 110 kb 3' , detected from rna-polymerase ii chia-pet data  <cit> . the gene kank <dig> is located in between the se and l1td <dig> but appears to be completely bypassed and accordingly is not expressed in mescs. as another example, we detect chromatin interaction between the promoter of epha <dig> and a se 15 kb 5' . finally, we found that p <dig> was able to detect one putative se that was not detected by med <dig> in mescs   <cit> . it is possible that other ses may not have been detected by med <dig>  however this remains to be determined. this suggests that p <dig> may assist in identifying additional ses that are important biological targets not found in previous analysis using med <dig> alone. binding of p <dig>  med <dig>  and h3k27ac is present in this se, suggesting that ses are marked by all three factors; however, they do not necessarily have enough factor density to make the se cutoff for all three factors. a closely related paralog to p <dig>  cbp, has also been used to mark ses  <cit> , and we show that it can identify a highly similar se repertoire as p <dig>  suggesting that these two factors have similar associations with ses .

since p <dig> chip-seq appears to be a robust method for systematic identification of ses, we analyzed all available p <dig> chip-seq data sets from multiple cells and tissues, in both human and mouse, and integrated the results with previously reported ses, increasing the total number of se datasets to > <dig> . datasets for the p <dig> paralog cbp are included as well  <cit> . these catalogs can be explored via our website . next, we demonstrate the power of this resource using t helper cells and macrophages as systems undergoing cell state transitions.

role of ses in t helper cell gene expression programs
th <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> cells differentiate from a common progenitor, naïve cd4+ t helper cells. they are important in the adaptive immune response and many immune-related diseases. lineage specification of t helper cells first requires cell activation, provided by stimulation of the t cell antigen receptor and co-stimulatory molecules such as cd <dig>  as well as cytokine signaling. t helper cells serve as a well-characterized model system for understanding cell differentiation  <cit> .

to determine how ses regulate gene expression programs during t helper cell differentiation, we integrated chip-seq and rna-seq data from various studies  . we found that 44 % of ses were shared by all three t helper cell subsets and 75 % by two or more cell types . when we compared more distantly related cells, less ses were shared: only 10 % of ses were shared between th <dig> cells and mescs, and 27 % were shared between th <dig> cells and activated b cells .fig.  <dig> super-enhancers in t helper cells. a ternary plot of p <dig> density at ses in th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> cells  or gene expression in the same cells . each dot is a se or gene. t helper cell ses are largely shared between all three subsets. axes indicate relative factor density between th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> cells. color scale indicates concentration of ses . chip-seq data are from  <cit> . rna-seq data are from  <cit> . b ternary plot of p <dig> density at ses in mesc, stimulated b cells, and th <dig> cells. color scale indicates concentration of ses. some ses are shared between b cells and th <dig> cells, but are distinct from mescs, a distantly related cell lineage. b cell chip-seq data are from  <cit> . c  il17a and il17f are regulated by a th17-specific se spanning both genes. also, a non-coding rna is transcribed 3' of il17f.  cd <dig>  ctla <dig> and icos are regulated by two ses active in th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> cells. similar levels of expression and p <dig> density are seen in all three cell types. d genes from both the th <dig> se module and the th <dig> gene expression module which have lower expression when treated with the rorγt inhibiting drugs, tmp <dig> or tmp <dig>  they are also expressed lower in rorγt-deficient th <dig> cells. ce-genes from th <dig> cells are generally unaffected . data are from  <cit> 



to see if ses are associated with cell-specific gene expression, we divided t helper cell ses and expressed genes into seven modules based on cell specificity . when ses were compared to expressed genes in a corresponding module , strong enrichment was seen: th <dig> genes were closer to th1-unique ses . in th <dig> cells, th <dig> genes were closer to th2-unique ses , and th <dig> genes were closer to th17-unique ses .

as validation, known signature cytokines and transcription factors were found in this enrichment analysis. for example, tbx <dig> and ifng, two signature th <dig> genes, are found near ses that are inactive in th <dig> and th <dig> cells, while rorc and il17a, th <dig> signature genes, are near th17-unique ses . cd <dig>  icos, and ctla <dig> share expression in th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> cells, and p <dig> ses are seen in all three cell types . overall,  <dig>  of all  <dig>  protein-coding genes expressed in t helper cells were located within 100 kb of a t helper cell se . a list of se-associated genes in t helper cells is provided in additional file 5: table s <dig> 

the transcription factors stat <dig>  rorγt, irf <dig>  and batf are required to drive the th <dig> gene expression program  <cit> . to determine whether these transcription factors control cell fate through ses, we analyzed rna-seq expression data from th <dig> cells treated with the rorγt inhibitors tmp <dig> and tmp <dig>  <cit> , and th <dig> cells missing key transcription factors  <cit> . se-associated genes from the th <dig> modules, such as the autoimmune susceptibility genes il23r and il17a, were strongly down-regulated as a result of these perturbations, and we hypothesize that rorγt, stat <dig>  and possibly irf <dig> and batf may be important for mediating th <dig> se activity . further analysis of the constituent regions of ses in th <dig> cells indicates that ses are highly enriched for sites co-bound by stat <dig>  batf, irf <dig>  c-maf and rorγt  . stat <dig> is capable of recruiting p <dig>  <cit>  and may play a direct role in assembly of super-enhanceosomes. in th <dig> cells missing stat <dig>  for example, there is a greater decrease in expression of genes associated with ses than ces .

transcription of non-coding rnas in relation to ses
since non-coding rnas are emerging as integral components of genetic regulatory networks, we explored their association with ses in t helper cells. we looked at mirnas and lncrnas, two classes of non-coding rna that are known to be cell specific and to be involved in gene regulation. we divided t cell lncrnas and mirnas into subset-specific modules  and looked at enrichment for ses  <cit>  . overall, enrichment was higher than for protein-coding genes, as 63 % of lncrnas vs 47 % of protein-coding genes were enriched for ses .fig.  <dig> non-coding rnas are frequently near or overlapping ses. a ternary plot of lncrna expression in th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> cells. color scale indicates concentration of lncrnas. notable examples of lncrnas that are lineage specific and located near ses are shown. rna-seq data are from  <cit> . b ternary plot of mirna expression in th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> cells. color scale indicates concentration of mirnas. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are labeled as examples of mirnas located near ses. small rna-seq data are from  <cit> . c lncrnas expressed from ses are cell-type specific.  nest, a lncrna  that is expressed from the se at the ifng locus. nest, ifng, and the se are active in th <dig> cells, but not in th <dig> or th <dig> cells.  mir- <dig> is expressed in th <dig> cells and is located near multiple ses that are active in t helper cells. d a se is more likely than a ce to be associated with a lncrna. proportion of ses or ces that are located within 100 kb of a lncrna expressed in th <dig>  th <dig>  or th <dig> cells . proportion of lncrnas  that are directly transcribed from ses or ces, in th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> cells  



we report that three previously described lineage-specific t cell lncrnas are in fact transcribed from lineage-specific ses. for example, nest is a lncrna important for protection from salmonella  <cit>  that is transcribed from a se 3' of ifng in th <dig> cells . interestingly, although the nest se is moderately enriched for p <dig> in th <dig> and th <dig> cells, it appears to only be active in th <dig> cells. additionally, there were two th2-specific lncrnas that were associated with th <dig> ses: lincr-epas1-3'-as and lincr-gata3-3' . these lncrnas are regulated by stat <dig> in th <dig> cells  <cit> .

next we focused on lncrnas that are directly transcribed from ses, as ses were much more likely to have lncrna transcription than ces  . for example, a se overlapping ccr <dig> has at least three non-coding transcripts arising from it . notably, two regions of the ccr <dig> ses are conserved between mouse and human . the expression of ccr <dig> and its lncrnas are reduced in the absence of stat <dig> and batf, tfs that bind throughout this locus, suggesting that they are directly regulating transcription of this locus. ccr <dig> is an important chemokine receptor for t cell lymph-node homing, and has a role in t cell mediated pathogenesis of inflammatory disease  <cit> . it is a possibility that many of these transcribed regions within ses represent ernas, however additional datasets such as gro-seq are necessary in order to validate this.

a microrna, mir- <dig>  highly expressed in all t helper cell subsets, is associated with a shared se . in contrast, mir- <dig>  appears to be regulated by a conditional th17-specific se , and as such, mir- <dig> has a pro-inflammatory role in th <dig> cells  <cit> . the mir <dig> locus contains moderate p <dig> binding in all three t helper cell lineages, despite the fact that expression of mir- <dig> is highest in th <dig> cells. however, one peak located 68 kb 5' of mir- <dig> is highly enriched in th <dig> cells relative to th <dig> and th <dig> cells, and may be responsible for the cell lineage specificity of this gene.

pharmacologic perturbation and genetic variation of ses blocks inflammatory response
we analyzed ses in unstimulated and stimulated mouse macrophages and explored their relation to inflammatory gene expression . macrophages activated by tlr <dig> signaling had a strikingly different se profile than unstimulated macrophages. in all, only 26 %  of ses were shared between the two macrophage states . genes that increase expression following tlr <dig> stimulation were closer to an induced se than pre-existing ses  or no se  . the top  <dig> most highly induced or repressed ses in activated macrophages were examined further .fig.  <dig> super-enhancers in unstimulated and activated macrophages. a a scatterplot of p <dig> density at enhancer sites in resting versus stimulated macrophages. b the density of p <dig> at many enhancers and ses is dynamically changed upon stimulation of macrophages. chip-seq data are from  <cit> . analysis of top  <dig> most highly induced ses upon macrophage activation  or repressed ses . density of p <dig> in activated macrophages is shown compared to resting macrophages. for those ses located within 100 kb of a macrophage inducible gene, the name of the gene is shown along with the fold change in expression . the absence of a gene name denotes the absence of an annotated protein-coding gene within 100 kb of the se. rna-seq data are from  <cit> . *continued from figure due to lack of space: fam63a , golph3l , lysmd <dig> , prune , scnm <dig> , vps <dig> , tmod <dig> . c the expression of many genes from  is blocked when tlr4-stimulated macrophages are treated with ibet. gro-seq data are from  <cit> . d a se near pim <dig> is induced following tlr <dig> stimulation. gro-seq reveals that this se is also transcribed when active. e  shown is a local association plot for a cis-eqtl that regulates the sgk <dig> gene. the most significantly associated snp from the linkage disequilibrium  region is rs <dig>  dotted line designates the r-squared value of  <dig>  used as a cutoff for determining linked snps. blue line indicates genomic recombination rate . the entire ld region is also located within a se active in human cd14+ monocytes. eqtl data are from naïve cd14+ cells  <cit> .  expression of sgk <dig> in human cd14+ monocytes, along with h3k27ac density . f enrichment of human monocyte eqtls in ses vs. ces. 550/ <dig> monocyte ses overlapped a naïve monocyte eqtl ld region , compared to only 5471/ <dig> ces . eqtl data are from  <cit> 



among the top  <dig> most highly induced ses, most were located in the vicinity of genes that are strongly expressed after macrophage activation . many of these genes are known to be essential players in the macrophage inflammatory response, such as il1a, il1b, ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  <cit> . the most highly activated se is near rsad <dig>  a gene encoding viperin, an antiviral protein that is induced in primary human macrophages  <cit> .

in contrast, many genes which maintain the naïve macrophage state are located near repressed ses, and are expressed at lower levels following macrophage stimulation . for example, slc29a <dig>  setdb <dig>  and tnfaip8l <dig> all serve to negatively regulate macrophages . these findings provide further insight into the gene expression program that controls macrophage homeostasis.

inhibitors of brd <dig> slows tumor cell growth by blocking se-mediated activation of cancer driver genes  <cit> . to determine whether the inflammatory response can be attenuated through inhibition of ses in a similar manner, we looked at tlr4-stimulated macrophages that were exposed to the brd <dig> inhibitor, ibet. se-associated gene expression decreased in macrophages upon exposure to ibet . these findings provide further understanding as to why such a drug can confer protection against systemic inflammation  <cit> .

ses induced by tlr <dig> stimulation in macrophages initially exhibit weak p <dig> binding in resting macrophages, suggesting that many ses originate at low density in unstimulated cells . erna expression coinciding with p <dig> peaks can also be seen at ses in some of these examples . gbp proteins are critical in host defense and can activate the inflammasome .

we found that non-coding expression quantitative trait loci  identified by fairfax et al.  <cit> , are often located within a monocyte se , providing human genetic evidence for se-mediated regulation. eqtls are nearly twice as enriched in ses, compared to ces  , although it remains a possibility that this enrichment is due to the fact that both ses and eqtls are enriched near promoters. as an example, we identify a se that is associated with sgk <dig>  which encodes a salt-sensing kinase recently implicated in th <dig> development   <cit> . the role of sgk <dig> in macrophages is not fully understood, although it has been implicated in disease  <cit> . additional examples include notch <dig> and litaf, which also perform important functions in macrophages .

discussion
by showing that p <dig> is a useful marker of ses in diverse cell types, we have established a widely applicable approach for prioritizing functionally important genomic regulatory regions. we provide evidence that p <dig> ses are generally similar to med <dig> ses in mescs. the ses we identified will be useful for understanding the regulation of genes important for defining cellular identity, which we demonstrate in our analysis of ses and gene regulation in multiple cell state transitions. we report that during macrophage activation, the se landscape is substantially remodeled, an observation that was not appreciated in previous studies  <cit> .

by showing that there are differences in the se repertoire between resting and activated macrophage cells, we suggest that inhibiting these elements could be a useful strategy to curb inflammation in disease processes such as obesity-induced insulin resistance  <cit> . specifically, genes regulated by ses can be selectively repressed by brd <dig> inhibitory drugs, such as ibet, with little effect on expression of other genes  <cit> . genes that are induced by tlr <dig> signaling and associated with ses in macrophages were strongly repressed by ibet. since ibet and similar drugs are currently being clinically evaluated as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer therapeutics, understanding their genetic targets in this way could lead to a better understanding of their mechanisms of action and possible side effects. in light of our findings, it would also be interesting to test p300-specific small molecule inhibitors  <cit> .

ses have been proposed to regulate genes important for cell identity. by examining p <dig> ses in several immune cells and escs, we show that a large number of ses are shared between closely related cells. however, genes important for cell identity, such as master regulator tfs, are often located near cell-specific ses. these results are consistent with the notion that cell-specific ses may play an important role in fate decision by regulating key genes, and could represent a novel approach for reprogramming cell fates. interestingly, the bet inhibitor jq <dig> has been demonstrated to inhibit th <dig> cells in mouse and human  <cit> . our work suggests that its mechanism of action may be to perturb ses in th <dig> cells. the findings in macrophages and th <dig> cells suggest that bet inhibitors should be useful in curbing inflammation and autoimmunity. however, it has also been proposed to treat cancer, and it is important to monitor that those patients do not become immunodeficient.

another acetyltransferase, cbp, a closely related paralog of p <dig>  may mark a se repertoire that is nearly identical to ses found using p <dig>  often, p <dig> and cbp are considered synonymous and redundant  <cit> . due to the similarity between these proteins, the antibody used to detect p <dig> may also bind to cbp, and vice versa, a possibility that must be considered when interpreting our results. in humans, heterozygous inactivating mutation of cbp results in rubinstein-taybi syndrome  <cit> . it would be interesting to determine whether pathogenesis of this disease is related to disruption of ses. in addition, there is the p300/cbp-associated factor  and its paralog, general control of amino acid synthesis nonrepressed protein  <dig> , both lysine acetyltransferases. their roles in relation to ses are unknown.

it has been shown that transcription activity at enhancers is important for neighboring gene expression  <cit> . several lncrnas that were found to be needed for the maintenance of pluripotency in a recent screen  <cit> , are identified here as associated with ses. similarly, the lncrna nest, which promotes ifng expression and the cd8+ t cell response to infection by salmonella  <cit> , could be classified as a se-associated lncrna or erna. we found that ses are widely transcribed relative to ces, sometimes producing multiple distinct non-coding transcripts . it is possible that many of these transcripts may be enhancer rnas , which may aid in enhancer regulation of nearby genes  <cit> . we propose that ernas emanating from ses should be categorized as sernas. if these sernas contribute to se function, they could represent an additional avenue for manipulating se activity. further, disease-associated genetic variation at se sites could lead to disease by disrupting non-coding rna and/or se function.

CONCLUSIONS
p <dig> chip-seq data can be leveraged to produce catalogs of ses in diverse cell types and provide a useful resource to reveal key nodes in genetic regulatory networks that govern cell fate determination. our findings illustrate the effectiveness of analyzing and integrating diverse datasets to make novel insights into biological processes, and our curated ses will serve as an important resource to the scientific community.
