BACKGROUND
expression quantitative trait loci  are genetic polymorphisms that affect the expression level of a gene. a variety of methods are commonly used to detect eqtls in individual tissues  <cit> . the identification of eqtls is important for dissection of human disease, by providing hypotheses for how genetic alterations translate to individual differences in biological function and risk for disease.

gene expression levels are known to vary widely between different types of tissue. consequently, the result of gene expression analysis often depends strongly on the type of tissue examined for any given experiment, and this too is applicable to the identification of eqtls. the study of tissue-by-tissue variation is an ongoing and dynamic area of research. in particular, the genotype-tissue expression  project  <cit>  is a large-scale collaborative effort to catalogue gene expression variation and genetic association with expression among several tissue types. the gtex database now includes expression measurements and candidate eqtls for over  <dig> different types of tissue. from a clinical perspective, it would be helpful to identify potential commonalities between gene expression profiles in accessible tissue  versus more inaccessible tissue  as this information could lead to the development of biomarkers for human diseases.

despite strong tissue-to-tissue variability in gene expression, results from the gtex project suggest that eqtls are often, but not always, shared across multiple tissues. therefore, when expression levels for multiple tissues are available, integrative methods that detect eqtls across all tissues simultaneously are preferable to simply analyzing each tissue separately. recent methods  <cit>  allow for the borrowing of information across tissue types for more accurate detection of eqtls. in this study, we present tissue-by-tissue analysis of eqtls separately for blood and dura mater tissue, and a joint analysis across the two tissues simultaneously. we compare these two approaches to determine if the gain in statistical power from the joint analysis reveals similar or different eqtls between the tissues.

this article describes the detection of eqtls for both blood and dura mater tissue for  <dig> individuals with chiari type  <dig> malformation . cmi is characterized by herniation of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum  and is estimated to affect 1% of the united states population  <cit> . cmi is a heterogeneous condition as the extent of tonsillar herniation, hypothesized mechanisms, and associated neurologic symptoms vary. the most common cause of cmi is cranial constriction resulting from an underdeveloped posterior fossa ; other proposed mechanisms include cranial settling, spinal cord tethering, intracranial hypertension, and intraspinal hypotension  <cit> . the mechanism of cranial settling and joint instability may explain the co-occurrence of connective tissue disorders in some patients with cmi  <cit> . symptoms of cmi vary widely in severity and often include headache, dizziness, neck pain, fatigue and difficulty swallowing  <cit> .

several lines of evidence exist that support a genetic contribution to cmi. these include twin studies, familial clustering, and co-segregation with known genetic syndromes . however, little is known about the underlying genetic factors, and the clinical heterogeneity of cmi suggests that it is also genetically heterogeneous. a case–control candidate gene association study identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the caudal type homeobox  <dig>  fms-related tyrosine kinase  <dig> , and aldehyde dehydrogenase  <dig> a <dig>  genes that were significantly associated  with cmi when the study population was restricted to  <dig> patients. these patients were determined to have a small pf by mri measurement  <cit> . a whole genome screen conducted in  <dig> reported evidence for linkage to regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> using  <dig> non-syndromic cmi multiplex families  <cit> . our group has carried out two additional whole genome screens. in the first screen, we used  <dig> non-syndromic cmi multiplex families and conducted a stratified linkage analysis using clinical criteria to reduce the genetic heterogeneity  <cit> . specifically, families were stratified based on presence of hereditary connective tissue disorders. this approach resulted in a marked increase in evidence for linkage to multiple regions of the genome. in particular, those families without presence of connective tissue disorders showed regions of linkage in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  both of which contain growth differentiation factors . in the second genome screen, an ordered subset analysis  using heritable and disease-relevant cranial morphologic traits identified increased evidence for linkage within subsets of families with similar cranial morphology. results from osa identified multiple genomic regions showing increased evidence for linkage, including regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> which implicated several biological candidates for disease  <cit> .

dura mater tissue surrounds the brain and spinal cord and is the final layer of the meninges, being located between the pia-arachnoid and bone. it is also a connective tissue, which is important because of the previously observed co-occurrence of cmi and connective tissue disorders  <cit> . therefore, dura is a reasonable candidate tissue to examine in order to better understand the genetic causes of cmi.

another study that used the same patient cohort as the present article identified cmi subtypes based on a clustering analysis of blood gene expression, dura gene expression, and cranial morphometrics  <cit> . these subtypes helped explain the clinical heterogeneity of cmi and implicated biological candidates responsible for this heterogeneity. nonetheless, there was generally little concordance observed between the blood and dura mater gene expression profiles. importantly, this study did not incorporate the patients’ genotypes in the analysis.

the goals of the present study were three-fold:  <dig>  to illustrate the relative advantages of a joint-tissue approach to eqtl analysis,  <dig>  to assess the concordance of eqtls in blood and dura tissue, and  <dig>  to explore the potential relevance of the identified eqtls to cmi pathogenesis. all study participants underwent decompression surgery of the skull and dura samples were obtained during surgery. however, because dura tissue is much less accessible than blood, studies have preferentially analyzed eqtls in blood for a range of clinical phenotypes, leaving dura expression under studied and also not represented in the gtex project. by collecting both dura and blood expression levels for a common cohort we may determine where it is appropriate to use blood as a proxy for dura expression. moreover, the integration of genotype and expression data through eqtl analysis provides novel information about potential candidate genes involved in the etiology of cmi.

RESULTS
tissue-by-tissue eqtl analysis
separate eqtl analyses for blood and dura tissue were performed as described in the methods section. the analyses included data for  <dig> individuals, with expression for  <dig>  genes and genotype for  <dig> , <dig> snps. a distinction was made between local  and distant  gene-snp pairs. a histogram of p-values for significance of each cis gene-snp association is shown in figure  <dig>  separately for dura and blood. a histogram of p-values for significance of each trans gene-snp association is shown in figure  <dig>  separately for dura and blood. all plots are relatively uniform with a marked increase in frequency near  <dig>  this indicates that some gene-snp pairs have a highly significant association, but the vast majority of the pairs have no detectable association. the cis analyses have a much more pronounced peak near  <dig>  indicating that for both tissues local eqtls are substantially more likely to be active than trans-eqtls, as expected.figure  <dig>

there were  <dig> genes with a highly significant cis-eqtl in blood, and  <dig> genes with a highly significant cis-eqtl in dura tissue ; of these,  <dig> genes were significant in both blood and dura tissues. there were  <dig> genes with a highly significant trans-eqtl in blood, and  <dig> genes with a highly significant trans-eqtl in dura tissue ; of these,  <dig> genes were significant in both blood and dura tissues. these data are summarized in table  <dig>  fisher’s exact test for association was highly significant for both the cis and trans tables , suggesting that the overlap in eqtls between the two tissues is not due to chance. data for all trans-eqtls are provided in additional file  <dig> table  <dig>

for cis-eqtls the partial variability in expression that is explained by the given snp  must be greater than  <dig> % to satisfy fdr <  <dig>  for dura and  <dig> % to satisfy fdr <  <dig>  for blood. thus, using stringent thresholds we only identify those eqtls with a large effect. further inspection suggested that the number of cis-eqtls shared by both tissues was drastically underestimated by considering the intersection of separate analyses. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of correlations between blood and dura expression for all  <dig>  genes considered, for the  <dig> genes with significant trans-eqtls only, and for the  <dig> genes with significant cis-eqtls only. the distribution of correlations for all genes is centered near  <dig> and nearly symmetric, the distribution for trans-genes is centered near  <dig> with a slight right skew, the distribution for cis genes is shifted dramatically to the right and 88% of cis genes have a positive correlation. hence, the vast majority of genes show no detectable association of expression between tissues, with the exception of genes with a cis-eqtl. this suggests that most cis-eqtls are shared between the two tissues, and that the separate eqtl analyses are underpowered. these results motivated the joint-tissue analysis described below.figure  <dig>

joint-tissue eqtl analysis
joint analysis of blood and dura tissue allowed for more accurate assessment of which eqtls are active in blood only, dura only, or both tissues. permutation testing under the joint model identified  <dig> genes with a highly significant  cis-eqtl in either tissue. the majority  of these genes were also identified by at least one of the tissue-specific analyses. for these  <dig> genes we focused on model comparison using bayesian posterior estimates to determine if that gene had an active eqtl in blood only, dura only, or both tissues. posterior probabilities that each gene had an active eqtl in blood only or dura only, as determined by the most highly associated snp, are shown in figure  <dig>  of these eqtls,  <dig> had a higher probability of being active in blood only ,  <dig> had a higher probability of being active in dura only, and  <dig> were predicted to be active in both tissues. a contingency table showing the agreement in gene classification between the joint-tissue and separate analyses is given in table  <dig>  for a more direct comparison, we also performed gene-level permutation-testing with the same software used for the multi-tissue analysis but with no inter-tissue dependence; this gave  <dig> cis-eqtls in dura and  <dig> cis-eqtls in blood , with  <dig> shared by both tissues. for both comparisons many more genes were predicted to have jointly present eqtls using the multi-tissue analysis than by simply considering the intersection of separate analyses. this result was expected, given the high level of between tissue correlation for genes with eqtls.figure  <dig>

additional file  <dig> gives results from the multi-tissue analysis for all genes considered. additional file  <dig> lists each of the  <dig> significant genes with additional information for each gene. we compared the strongest eqtl for each gene with association p-values from the gtex database for blood. as expected, most  of eqtls that were identified as active in blood only also had a gtex p-value <  <dig>  and less  of eqtls that were identified as active in dura only were significant in the gtex database. interestingly, only 37% of eqtls that were determined to be active in both blood and dura had a p-value <  <dig>  in the gtex database.

among all genes considered,  <dig> % had a measured snp in at least one of its probe targets. among the  <dig> genes identified,  <dig>  had a snp in a probe, and in  <dig> such genes  the eqtl snp was in ld  with at least one snp in a probe for that gene. these eqtls were flagged as potential artifacts due to hybridization, and this information is given in additional file  <dig>  we prioritized those genes that had eqtls active in dura only, or that were strongly active in both tissues, but not significant in the gtex database, because we deemed these eqtls more likely to be relevant to cmi pathophysiology. among these prioritized eqtls, the genes importin  <dig> , xylosyltransferase i , and protein kinase camp-dependent regulatory type i alpha  were all found to have a very strong eqtl in both blood and dura tissue. these eqtls had an fdr <  <dig>  in the joint and tissue-by-tissue analyses, and the snp-gene association showed a strong linear trend in both tissues . all three eqtls did not show a significant association in the gtex database. however, ipo <dig> expression was associated with a snp in its probe target. we elaborate on the biological function and potential relevance to cmi for each of these genes in the discussion.figure  <dig>

family-based association test 
a fbat was performed on an independent familial population to assess the presence of genotype associations with the occurrence of cmi. neither a full fbat including over  <dig> million snps, or a reduced fbat analysis restricted to those  <dig> snps identified by the joint-tissue eqtl analysis above, resulted in any highly significant associations after an fdr adjustment . nevertheless, p-values resulting from the fbat analysis for  <dig> snps are listed in additional file  <dig>  and provide additional support for certain candidate genes. in particular, ribosomal protein  <dig>  had a strong eqtl in both tissues , no significant eqtl in the gtex database, and a small fbat nominal p-value . together these data suggested a potential role of rps <dig> in the development of cmi.

furthermore, we considered those eqtls within a linkage region for cmi, as identified by the previous stratified linkage  <cit>  and ordered subset  <cit>  analyses. of all snps considered,  <dig> % belong to such a region. of the  <dig> eqtls identified by the joint tissue analysis,  <dig> belonged to such a region and these are annotated in additional file  <dig>  the enrichment of snps belonging to such a region among these  <dig>  relative to all snps, was not significant .

network and pathway analyses
a functional protein interaction network based on the joint-tissue eqtl analysis is shown in figure  <dig>  for relevance to cmi, only those genes with a strong eqtl in both dura and blood  or a significant eqtl in dura only were included in the network . the majority of genes do not interact with one another based on interactions within string . however, a common network connects several genes associated with ribosome function. these genes include the ribosomal proteins rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl36al, the ribosome biogenesis homolog nsa <dig>  and the ribosome production factor homolog rpf <dig>  of the  <dig> genes that are included in this network,  <dig> have their strongest eqtl predicted to occur in dura only . of the remaining  <dig> genes,  <dig> did not have their strongest eqtl replicated in the gtex database  ; only rps <dig> occurred in both dura and blood and shared its most significant eqtl with the gtex database. a pathway enrichment analysis of genes predicted to have eqtls in blood and dura or dura only  was performed using both go and kegg pathways. the only pathway that was significantly enriched in this gene set at fdr <  <dig>  was the kegg ribosome pathway, including genes rps <dig>  rpl36al, rpl22l <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig> figure  <dig>

together, these results indicate that coordinated activity among multiple genes from the joint-tissue eqtl analysis is primarily related to ribosomal function. the eqtl associated with most of these genes occurs in dura only, or is not significant in the gtex database, suggesting that these eqtls may be related to cmi.

discussion
a comparison of the tissue-by-tissue and joint-tissue analyses illustrates the advantages of an integrative multi-tissue approach to eqtl analysis. the joint-tissue analysis identified more significant eqtls overall, suggesting that borrowing information across tissue types increased statistical power. in particular, the combined use of exploratory plots and the joint-tissue analysis suggested that the number of eqtls shared by both blood and dura was vastly underestimated when simply taking the intersection of tissue-by-tissue analyses. consequently, the number of tissue-specific eqtls was overestimated. the joint-tissue analysis gives a more principled way to assess whether an eqtl is shared or specific to a given tissue.

we found substantially higher between-tissue correlation in genes with cis-eqtls than genes with trans-eqtls; this agrees with studies of eqtl specificity on other tissues  <cit> . approximately 79% of cis-eqtls that were detectable in either dura or blood were predicted to be shared by both tissues. the only previous comparison of expression levels for blood and dura, using the same sample set, found little concordance between the two tissues  <cit> ; however, this analysis did not investigate eqtls. we similarly found that the association between expression in blood and dura tissue was generally negligible, but importantly, we found high levels of association in expression of genes with cis-eqtls. this is almost certainly because most cis-eqtls are shared across the tissues. we posit that genes with eqtls are more likely to play an important role in conditions with a genetic component, such as cmi. thus, our conclusions provide some support for the utility of future biomarker development for cmi in less invasive tissues, such as blood.

we identified three genes with strong eqtls in both blood and dura tissues that were not significant in the gtex database and had function that was potentially relevant to cmi: ipo <dig>  xylt <dig>  and prkar1a. ipo <dig> expression was previously associated with osteoblast differentiation  <cit> , and found to be increased 25-fold in patients with os odontoideum in a comparative twin study  <cit> . these results suggest that ipo <dig> may play a role in bone development, a process believed to underlie the etiology of cmi in at least some cases  <cit> . xylt <dig> activity has also been implicated in ossification  <cit> , specifically as a regulator of chondrocyte maturation  <cit> . mutations in prkar1a have been associated with acrodysostosis, a genetic disorder of bone growth  <cit> . these candidate genes all relate to bone growth and development, and their relevance to cmi is supported by evidence that cranial morphometrics are heritable within cmi families and associated with cmi case status  <cit> .

several genes with strong eqtls were related to ribosomal function. these genes had eqtls primarily in dura tissue only, or had an eqtl in both blood and dura tissue, but were not significant in the gtex database. this suggests that ribosomal expression may be relevant to the etiology of cmi. mutations and expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins have been implicated in a variety of conditions related to bone marrow dysfunction and disorders of skeletal development. these include the bone marrow disorders diamond-blackfan anemia and schwachman-diamond syndrome, and the skeletal development disorders cartilage-hair hypoplasia and treacher collins syndrome  <cit> . treacher collins syndrome is characterized by craniofacial abnormalities  <cit> . there is also a link between ribosomal bone marrow disorders and skeletal conditions, as both diamond-blackfan anemia and schwachman-diamond syndrome have been associated with craniofacial and skeletal anomalies  <cit> . several cases have been reported where cmi and bone marrow disorders co-occur  <cit> . however, the causal association between ribosomal function and cmi, if any, requires further examination. our study participants were examined for the presence of anemia based on a review of medical records, and only two patients were identified with low mean corpuscular volume  values . it remains unclear if the ribosomal protein associations observed in the present study are representative of a link between cmi and underlying anemia.

gene expression of dura tissue has not been well studied, in part because of its inaccessibility without invasive surgery. while the present study allowed a unique opportunity to examine dura expression, its scope of inference is limited to young patients with cmi. dura tissue is a natural candidate for the study of cmi because of its proximity to cranial bone, and the co-occurrence of cmi and connective tissue disorders  <cit> . however, there may be important genetic factors in the development of cmi that are not manifested in blood or dura tissue, but are best characterized within the bone itself, or other tissue types.

while the joint–tissue analysis improves power, it is still limited by the study sample size and conservative criteria for significance. only eqtls with strong relative effects on gene expression are identified, and so these results do not represent a comprehensive catalogue of eqtls in blood and dura tissues.

the interpretation of eqtl results requires caution, as not all observed gene-snp associations may be caused by true regulatory effects. some associations may be due to technical artifacts such as rna hybridization issues, and we have attempted to flag suspect associations. furthermore, because the present study was restricted to patients with cmi it is subject to the effects of conditioning on a “collider”  <cit> . specifically, an association may be observed in a gene-snp pair if both the gene and the snp are independently associated with cmi status, even if there is no true regulatory effect.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented the first joint-eqtl analysis of dura mater and blood. we demonstrated that the integrative statistical approach of joint-eqtl analysis is more powerful than identifying the intersection of single tissue analysis. our significant eqtls revealed functionally relevant and novel candidate genes for the pathology of cmi and provide the basis of further exploration.
