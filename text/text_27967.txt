BACKGROUND
cornea is composed of five separate layers i.e. an outer stratified layer of squamous non-keratinized epithelium, bowman’s membrane, stroma layer, descemet’s membrane and the innermost endothelial layer. corneal epithelium serves as the first line barrier against infections or insults from harmful environmental agents. in superficial corneal injury such as corneal abrasion which is often caused by mechanical injuries such as trauma or chemical burn  <cit> , the corneal epithelial integrity is affected  <cit> . thus, a faster rate of wound healing of the corneal epithelium is vital for optimal function and protection of the inner structures of the cornea. corneal epithelial wound healing occurs in three phases i.e. migration, cell proliferation, and remodelling  <cit> .

migration and proliferation of epithelial cells are essential for wound closure during initial phase of corneal epithelial wound healing. epithelial cells express the specific corneal epithelial differentiation marker, cytokeratin  <dig>  and cytokeratin  <dig>  once the cells left the limbal basal layer during centripetal migration  <cit> . these cells also expressed fibronectin, a prototype of cell adhesion protein required for cell attachment, migration, differentiation, wound healing and cytoskeletal organization  <cit> . the migration phase in cornea wound healing is influenced by the synthesis of cluster of differentiation  <dig> , the primary cell surface receptor for hyaluronate  receptor  <cit> .

the standard treatment for corneal abrasion is application of topical antibiotic or antifungal eye drop in order to prevent secondary infection. however, these antibiotics can cause microbial resistance in the long run  <cit>  while preservative such as benzalkonium ammonium chloride  in eye drops may result in disruption of corneal epithelium, thereby delaying wound healing  <cit> .

honey has been documented to have wound healing properties on skin as it possesses antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions  <cit> . it has high sugar content flavonoids, phenolic acids, organic acids and mineral in different compositions depending on its floral and geographical source  <cit> . since cornea and skin are both derived from surface ectoderm embryologically, we hypothesized that honey could have the same potential effects in accelerating the migration and proliferation of cec during corneal epithelial wound healing.

acacia honey  is a local honey in malaysia collected by apis mellifera honeybees from acacia mangium trees  <cit> . ah was reported to promote wound contraction resulting from burn injury  <cit>  but its therapeutic effects on corneal epithelium still remains unknown. in the present study, we have established an in vitro corneal abrasion wound healing model aiming for quantitative evaluation of the effects of ah on the migration and healing properties of cec during wound healing.

methods
this study was conducted following approval obtained from the research and ethical committee, faculty of medicine, universiti kebangsaan malaysia  and universiti kebangsaan malaysia animal ethics committee .

acacia honey 
acacia honey  was purchased from ministry of agriculture, malaysia and gamma irradiated at 25 kgy at ministry of science, technology and innovation, malaysia. the optimal concentration of ah was identified as  <dig> % according to our previous study  <cit> .

rabbit corneal epithelial cells isolation and culture
cec from six new zealand white strain rabbits’ corneas were removed, isolated and culture expanded as described previously  <cit> . in brief, the corneas were cut 2 mm beyond the cornea-scleral junction. the unwanted connective tissue such as ocular muscles, iris and conjunctiva were removed. the endothelium was gently scraped off. the corneas were rinsed with phosphate buffered solution  before incubation in dispase solution 2 mg/ml  at 4°c for 18 hours to separate the epithelium from the stroma. using a fine surgical blade, the epithelial layer was gently removed followed by digestion with 5 ml of  <dig> % trypsin-edta  in a centrifuge tube to obtain single cell suspension. five ml of define trypsin inhibitor  were added to neutralize the reaction of trypsin-edta and was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 minutes. the resultant pellet was suspended in complete cornea medium  containing human corneal growth supplement  and antibiotic antimycotic . viable cec were seeded in six well-plates  with seeding density of 1 ×  <dig> cells per well. cells were cultured in 5% co <dig> incubator  under 95% humidity at 37°c. upon 80% confluence, cells were trypsinized with 1 ml of versene  and  <dig> % trypsin-edta and subcultured until passage  <dig> . media were changed every 2 days. the cec morphological changes were examined everyday with inverted phase contrast microscope .

discussion
migration of the corneal epithelial cells following injury occurs in two ways. daughter cells of the epithelium called transient amplifying cells  migrates centripetally with convex leading border into the basal layer of the corneal epithelium and differentiate into the upper layers of the corneal epithelium to become post-mitotic cells. simultaneously, the epithelial cells undergo preferential circumferential migration which encircles the limbus until the migrating cells meet together  <cit> . using our in vitro corneal abrasion model, the cec was found to migrate centripetally following 24 hours post wound creation. an earlier in vivo study reported the migration of epithelium from limbus to the centre of the cornea took  <dig> to 72 hours following chemical injury  <cit> .

the migration phase in the corneal epithelium are greatly metabolic and depends on the glucose provided in the aqueous humor and epithelial glycogen stores as the main source of energy  <cit> . during wounding, glucose transporter protein  <dig>  expression was elevated in the corneal epithelial cell membranes and limbal basal to facilitate and transport glucose to the glucose-starved epithelium  <cit> . it was documented that the expression of glut <dig> doubled at wound area following 4 hours of injury and continued to rise even after epithelial wound closure  <cit> . in the present study, we showed the migration of cec was accelerated in the ah-supplemented media. glucose, the main composition in honey is responsible for energy production through glycolysis  <cit> . ah possesses the highest total sugar contents  compared to any other local honey  <cit> . glucose in ah may have provided additional energy resources via glut <dig> accelerating the migration of cec for wound closure in the corneal abrasion in vitro model.

honey efficiently produces a slow-release supply of hydrogen peroxide, a component in honey activated by the enzyme glucose oxidase when honey is diluted  <cit> . hydrogen peroxide in honey is well known for its antibacterial property. bacterial infection is also known to delay wound healing  <cit> . the activation of hydrogen peroxide in ah-supplemented media serves as an ideal culture condition for cec, thus accelerating the migration of cec in closing the wounded area. previous study reported that hydrogen peroxide in low concentration was found to assist wound healing by stimulating epithelial cells migration from wound edges and promoting fibroblasts growth during inflammatory stage  <cit> . during in vivo wound healing, hydrogen peroxide was reported to provide sufficient oxygen and nutrient to the healing tissues via angiogenesis  <cit> .

ah is known to possess the highest total contents of trace elements, i.e. aluminium , chromium , caesium , copper , ferum , indium , potassium , magnesium , manganese , sodium , rubidium , strontium , uranium  and zinc  compared to other local honey  <cit> . it has been documented that zn accelerates wound contraction in full-thickness incision wound during the initial stage of wound healing  <cit> , which further support the results from the present study.

ck <dig> is a basic keratin pair of ck <dig> and its expression is an indication of terminally differentiated epithelial cells  <cit> . higher expression of ck <dig> gene in cec cultured in ah-supplemented media proved that ah promotes centripetal migration of cec for wound closure. these findings were in agreement with the cell migration study. the expression of ck <dig> was higher in ccm group which contains human corneal growth factors , epidermal growth factor  and bovine pituitary extract . egf has been documented to stimulate proliferation, migration and differentiation of epithelial cells  <cit> . the ck <dig> protein expression was in accordance with the gene expression analysis. ck <dig> protein expression indicates that epithelial cells had differentiated during wounding and maintains the corneal epithelial cell phenotype  <cit> . a recent study showed an increase in the in vitro migration rate of human corneal epithelial cells cultured in egf-enriched media showed elevated expression of ck <dig> gene and protein  <cit> .

following injury, fibronectin was expressed abundantly and rapidly in the wounded region which marked the initiation of corneal epithelial wound healing mechanism  <cit> . fibronectin acts as temporary extracellular matrix for the attachment of the migrating corneal epithelial cells towards the wounded region  <cit> . fibronectin was expressed within one to eight hours after injury by fibroblasts and basal cells adjacent to the wounded region  <cit> . this study revealed that the fibronectin gene was expressed abundantly during initial day of wound creation especially in ah-supplemented media. other studies also reported the increase expression of fibronectin in cornea after photorefractive keratectomy   <cit>  and mechanical abrasion injury  <cit> . increase in the fibronectin expression is regulated by modulators namely cyclic adenosine 3’,-5’phosphate , glucocorticoids, and growth factors such as egf, tgf, and pdgf  <cit>  which explained the increase in the expression of fibronectin in ccm group in the present study. protein fibronectin reduced progressively during re-epithelisation  <cit>  and three weeks after prk as evidenced in immunohistology staining  <cit> . these results were in accordance to our study which showed reduction in fibronectin expression as the re-epithelialisation occurred.

cd <dig> gene expression is increased during injury to human eyes and mouse lens indicating its significance during inflammatory phase during wound healing  <cit> . transcription of cd <dig> gene increased encircling wound margin three hours following epithelium injury and was the highest at 18 hours in the basal epithelial cells corresponding to the initiation of active migration  <cit> . our findings revealed that ah supplemented in culture medium promoted migration during initial phase of wound healing. a significant up-regulation in the level of total cd <dig> mrna at day  <dig> compared to initial day of wound creation, particularly in bm supplemented with ah. this is consistent with the hypothesis that the expression of cd <dig> offers adhesive strength for the epithelial sheet and cell-substratum interactions which mediates cell migration during corneal re-epithelialisation  <cit> . it has also been proposed that cd <dig> gene expression declines when epithelial cells proliferate and differentiated to restore the multi-layered epithelium  <cit> . in this study, re-epithelialisation through cell proliferation and differentiation was greater in the ccm supplemented with ah group compared to that of bm supplemented with ah group at day  <dig> causing reciprocal reduction of cd  <dig> gene expression. a reduction in cd <dig> gene expression in cec cultured in ah-supplemented media at day  <dig> further suggests ah stimulated cell differentiation during re-epithelialisation. an increase in immunodeposition of cd <dig> protein has been reported after four hours at wound region in vivo alkali burn corneal injury, but reduced towards normal level after 7 weeks following complete wound closure and re-epithelisation  <cit> .

admittedly, there was a limitation in the study. a group comprising mixture of glucose and fructose equivalent to ah may have served as a good control. this would have further strengthened the healing effects of ah on the in vitro corneal abrasion wound healing model.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study showed acacia honey  accelerates wound closure of cultured cec of the in vitro corneal abrasion wound healing model which were evident via migration study, morphology, gene and protein expression analyses. acacia honey is a potential candidate for the establishment of acacia honey based pharmaceutical eye drop for the treatment of corneal abrasion in the near future.
