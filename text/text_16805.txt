BACKGROUND
fo has been, and still remains, the principal lipid source for fish diets in intensive aquaculture <cit> . because the wild fisheries, from which fo is obtained, are currently fished to the maximal sustainable levels there is pressure to utilise alternative lipid sources in aquaculture diets. currently the most practical alternatives are vos and recent studies have demonstrated that vo can be used to replace up to 75% of fo without significant effects on growth in atlantic salmon  <cit> . however the effects of vo-based diets on normal metabolism and physiology and ultimately fish health and welfare are not yet understood. a variety of potentially deleterious effects have been reported in vo-fed fish. these include cardiac lesions  <cit> , liver histopathology  <cit> , compromised immune function  <cit>  and disruption of intestinal function  <cit> . there is good reason to suspect that feeding of vo may have a major impact on fish physiology since vo differ considerably in composition compared to fo. for example vos are rich in shorter chain, c <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids  and devoid of n-3hufa. indeed, fatty acid compositions in fish, including salmon, fed vo are characterised by increased levels of c <dig> pufa and decreased levels of n-3hufa, which could compromise their nutritional value to the human consumer  <cit> .

massively parallel gene expression profiling technologies such as cdna or oligonucleotide microarrays are powerful tools for discovering genes which change their tissue or cellular expression levels in response to changed conditions and thence enable the physiological mechanisms underlying such changes to be elucidated. until recently there have been few such resources for commercially important fish species. the recent development of high density cdna microarrays for atlantic salmon , linseed oil  or soybean oil .

RESULTS
growth and biometry
slightly, but significantly, lower final weights were obtained with fish fed the lo diets compared to fish fed fo . however, no effect of dietary oil was observed in the specific growth rate  obtained for individually pit-tagged fish. dietary vos had no effect on feed efficiency as measured by feed conversion ratio , hepato-somatic index  or viscero-somatic index  or condition factor .

initial and final weights , sgr  , vsi , hsi  and cf  moisture, protein, lipid, ash  are all means ± sd. significance of differences between means were determined by one -way anova followed, where appropriate, by tukey's multiple comparison test as described in the materials and methods. values within a row with a different superscript letter are significantly different . cf, condition factor =  <dig> × 3; fcr, feed conversion ratio = feed consumed /weight gain ; hsi, hepato-somatic index =  <dig> × ; sgr, specific growth rate  =  <dig> × ; vsi, viscero-somatic index =  <dig> × . p/l, protein:lipid ratio.

proximate, lipid and fatty acid compositions
all the vo diets significantly increased the relative percentage of protein in the whole fish compared to fish fed the fo diet . there was also a tendency for the vo diets to decrease whole body lipid, and increase the protein:lipid ratio although these parameters were only significant in fish fed lo . liver total lipid content was not significantly affected by dietary vos, but there was a trend towards increased free fatty acids in fish fed lo and increased total neutral lipid and triacylglycerol in fish fed so and lo . dietary vo had only a few significant effects on the lipid class composition of liver with the most obvious being fish fed lo and so showing reduced proportions of phosphatidylethanolamine compared to fish fed fo . differences in phosphatidylcholine levels were also observed between ro and lo, although none of the vo diets showed significant differences compared to fo. increases in total unknown neutral lipid were also apparent in ro and so fed fish compared to fo. in general the fatty acid compositions of liver and flesh total lipid  reflected the fatty acid compositions of the diets. thus fish fed the fo diet were characterised by high levels of 16: <dig>  20:5n- <dig>  and 22:6n- <dig> , with 20:4n- <dig>  as the major n- <dig> fatty acid. feeding the vos resulted in increased proportions of 18:1n- <dig> and total monoenes, 18:2n- <dig> and total n-6pufa, and 18:3n- <dig>  and decreased the proportions of 16: <dig> and total saturated fatty acids, ara, epa and dha. specifically, the major fatty acids in fish fed ro, so and lo were 18:1n- <dig>  18:2n- <dig> and 18:3n- <dig>  respectively. fish fed the vegetable oils also showed increased proportions of the metabolites of these fatty acids, namely 20:3n- <dig> and 20:4n- <dig> in fish fed lo, 20:2n- <dig> and 20:3n- <dig> in fish fed so, and 20:1n- <dig> in fish fed ro.

values are means ± sd of  <dig> samples each of tissue pooled from  <dig> fish. significance of differences between means were determined by one-way anova followed, where appropriate, by tukeys multiple comparison post hoc test. values within a row with a different superscript letter are significantly different . cl, cardiolipin; lyso-pc, lysophosphatidylcholine; pg, phosphatidylglycerol. all values are expressed as percentage total lipid, except total lipid which is expressed as percentage of wet weight.

values are means ± sd of  <dig> samples each of tissue pooled from  <dig> fish. significance of differences between means were determined by one-way anova followed, where appropriate, by tukey's multiple comparison test as described in the materials and methods. values within a row with a different superscript letter are significantly different .  <dig>  contains 15: <dig>  20: <dig> and 22: <dig>  present in some samples at up to  <dig> %;  <dig>  predominantly n- <dig> isomer;  <dig>  predominantly n- <dig> isomer;  <dig>  predominantly n- <dig> isomer;  <dig>  totals include 18:3n- <dig>  22:4n- <dig> and 22:5n- <dig> present in some samples at up to  <dig> %.

liver enzyme activities
no effect of diet was detected on the activity of liver carnitine palmitoyl transferase  <dig>  activity, although fatty acid β-oxidation was increased in lo and ro fed fish. hufa synthesis was increased in liver microsomes from fish fed all the vos compared to fish fed fo. the activity of malic enzyme  was increased in fish fed the ro diet in comparison to fish fed fo .

microarray gene expression profiling
comparison of each experimental diet to fo identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> features from ro, lo and so respectively which were significantly different . these lists from each vo were then compared and features which were significantly changed relative to fo in two or more vo diets  were retained. this resulted in a list of  <dig> features. features were then eliminated which were changed in different directions in different vo diets, resulting in a list of  <dig> features,  <dig> of which could be tentatively identified according to blast results. these genes whose expression was changed, and whose identity could be indicated from blast similarity, in two or more vo diets compared to fo, are listed in table  <dig> 

numbers indicate expression ratio and a significant change  is indicated by bold type. lo, linseed oil; so, soyabean oil; ro, rapeseed oil. accession numbers of array features are provided. tc numbers are also provided, as described in text.

gene ontology  terms for biological processes were available for  <dig> of the  <dig> features with significant blast similarities that were changed in vo diets. the biological process go terms associated with these  <dig> genes were compared with the total go list for the traits/sgp, and tested for significant  overrepresentation as implemented in genespring gx  <dig> . <dig> . only go categories represented by more than one gene from the final gene list were considered significant and are reported in table  <dig>  overrepresented go categories included lipid metabolism, sterol biosynthesis, isoprenoid biosynthesis, fatty acid desaturation, mrna processing, and translational elongation. it should be noted that the current gene ontology annotations  for the traits/sgp array are only available for  <dig> of the  <dig> features. notably amongst those genes in the final list which were overrepresented after go analysis, were genes showing the greatest increase in expression. these included Δ5/ <dig> fatty acyl desaturases which function in hufa biosynthesis  and isopentenyl-diphosphate Δisomerase , lathosterol oxidase, and squalene epoxidase, all genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway . levels of other genes associated with lipid metabolism  or transport were also changed. these included increases in apoliporotein b  and decreases in an apob-like gene in lo and so. effects were seen in levels of expression of genes involved in transcription, rna processing and translation .

many of the remaining genes from the final list could also be grouped into distinct biological process categories, although they were not identified as such by go analysis. changes in carbohydrate metabolism genes included an increase in the expression of glycogen phosphorylase in all vo, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in so and ro. several changes in expression levels of genes of protein degradation associated with the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway were observed, and also in the protease calpain <dig> which was upregulated more than five fold in all vo. signal transduction genes were also changed and marcks-like  <dig> was increased in all vo treatments and protein phosphatase 1β decreased in all vo treatments. genes for proteins with extracellular locations which changed in vo included the protease inhibitors cystatin, spint <dig> and tissue factor pathway inhibitor  <dig>  as well as decreased expression of collagen1a <dig>  in addition there were  <dig> features changed by vo for which no identity could be confirmed by blast .

quantitative pcr 
results for qpcr are presented in table  <dig>  three genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway were upregulated in vo fed fish. one of these, ipp, represented by two microarray features, was selected for qpcr, another 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase was also on the array but was not significantly changed . a further two genes, mevalonate kinase  and srebp <dig> were selected for qpcr because they were not present on the microarray, but were identified in blast searches of atlantic salmon est collections. mk was upregulated in all three vo, whilst srebp <dig> mrna was significantly increased in lo and ro, although not in so . hmg-coa reductase , another gene in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was not changed, either on the basis of microarray data or by qpcr. Δ <dig> fatty-acyl desaturase mrna was also confirmed by qpcr to increase in all vo diets. a number of other lipid metabolic genes, selected on the basis of the microarray data were also assayed by qpcr. qpcr confirmed the microarray result that carnitine palmitoyl transferase a  mrna was not changed, whilst qpcr of apolipoprotein b mrna  demonstrated upregulation in lo and ro, whereas the array results indicated upregulation in so and lo. three other genes  whose expression was not different between fo and vo by array analysis were also confirmed not to be changed after qpcr. however pparγ which showed altered expression levels on micorarray analysis was not changed as measured by qpcr.

the identity of the genes tested is indicated. those genes which were significantly changed  in fish fed linseed oil , soyabean oil  or rapeseed oil  compared to fish oil are indicated in bold. expression numbers indicate fold change relative to fish oil.

discussion
although there were some relatively small differences, no great effects of diet on growth were observed in the present trial. nevertheless, the effects of diet on tissue fatty acid composition are very clear with vo having highly significant effects. these effects are as expected and as reported in several previous trials on salmon  <cit> .

as a means of more fully investigating the possible effects of vo substitution, liver was chosen to undertake a gene expression profiling experiment using the recently developed traits/sgp microarray for atlantic salmon. liver integrates a large part of the nutritional uptake from the diet and has particular roles in distributing dietary lipid, and synthesising lipid de novo as well as participating in detoxification and excretion pathways. the use of high density cdna microarrays is now a well established method, and we sought to use the traits/sgp array to discover genes, and indicate biochemical and physiological pathways whose expression patterns might change during adaptation to vo-based diets. in this dna microarray hybridisation experiment, application of anova indicated that  <dig> features were changed at p ≤  <dig>  across all diet groups. however, application of either multiple testing correction  or a post hoc test  reduced this list of features  <dig> fold. nevertheless, it was apparent that amongst the features from the list generated by anova which passed filters for multiple testing correction or post hoc testing, were genes for Δ5/Δ <dig> fatty acyl desaturases. given that these desaturase genes were known from prior experiments to be up-regulated in vo fed salmon  <cit>  we filtered genes according to the criteria of having expression changed in the same direction in two or more of the vo dietary conditions after individual t-tests. in support of this approach it is notable that of the  <dig> genes which were scored as being changed in two or more vo diets, only  <dig> showed expression changes in opposite directions, far less than would be expected by chance alone. we tested the validity of the list of commonly changed candidates by a combination of compositional, biochemical and independent gene expression measurement by qpcr. the overall consistency of gene expression and physiological data demonstrates the validity of our approach to interpreting the microarray results presented here.

the most consistently and highly up-regulated genes that could be identified by homology or had previously been characterised and were clearly overrepresented after go analysis were those of the Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> fatty acyl desaturases. desaturases are encoded by several genes in salmon and each of them were represented on the array. every one of these showed significant up-regulation in two or more of the vo diets. qpcr confirmed that desaturase mrnas were increased and in addition the biosynthesis of hufa was increased in liver microsomes from vo-fed fish. however, despite this clear increase in desaturase mrna and hufa biosynthesis, the amount of hufa in salmon tissue was still considerably reduced when fo was replaced by vo in the diet. these results confirm previous reports describing the expression of salmon Δ5/Δ <dig> desaturase, where feeding of vo has been shown to increase desaturase expression and hufa biosynthesis  <cit> .

in addition to the increase in fatty acyl desaturase expression, increases in mrna for three enzymes  of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway were also evident from microarray data and from qpcr for ipp. to test the hypothesis that the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway was up-regulated following vo feeding the atlantic salmon est collections were searched for genes which are known to participate in cholesterol biosynthesis, but were not present on the traits/sgp array. two genes were identified and assayed by qpcr, mk and srebp <dig>  mk is known to be highly regulated by cholesterol level in mammalian liver and srebp <dig> is a master transcriptional regulator of both cholesterol and hufa biosynthesis  <cit> . messenger rna for both of these genes was increased by a similar amount to that seen for ipp. the activity of srebp <dig> is controlled by cellular cholesterol status, such that reductions in membrane cholesterol trigger proteolytic cleavage of membrane bound srebp <dig> and lead to its translocation to the nucleus where it drives the transcription of the genes for cholesterol and hufa biosynthesis  <cit> . of the  <dig> genes involved in lipid metabolism which were changed on the microarray after feeding vo,  <dig> are known to be regulated by srebps   <cit> . another gene in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which by qpcr was upregulated in all vo, was on present the traits-sgp array, but was not present in the final output gene list. one other gene critical for cholesterol biosynthesis, hmg-coa reductase was present on the array but remained unchanged and qpcr analysis confirmed that vo had no effect on levels of hmg coa reductase mrna. this is surprising since in mammals hmg-coa reductase is regulated directly by cholesterol levels, by hormonal stimuli, and transcriptionally by srebps, and therefore our results suggest some differences in the regulation of this gene between fish and mammals. nevertheless, taken together the effects on genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway strongly suggests that salmon fed vo respond to reduced cholesterol levels in the diet. although we did not measure cholesterol contents of the diets, a recent report, which quantifies cholesterol and total sterol levels in the raw ingredients used to formulate the diets, confirms the deficiency of cholesterol in vo diets  <cit> . moreover, it is known that in vegetable oils the bulk of sterol is present as sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol or brassicasterol depending on source  <cit> . these plant sterols are not taken up by mammals, and indeed inhibit cholesterol uptake  <cit>  and, although not proven, are unlikely to be taken up by fish. therefore one of the major responses of salmon liver during adaptation to vo is up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis to compensate for deficiencies in the diet. importantly, and in contrast to the situation with hufa, lower levels of dietary cholesterol were fully compensated for, since no differences were observed in cholesterol content, in liver or in flesh between fish fed fo or vos. from the data presented here the compensation for reduced dietary cholesterol is due to up-regulation of hepatic cholesterol biosynthetic pathways, although other pathways such as decreased bile acid synthesis might also contribute. it should be noted, however, that this experiment consisted of a  <dig> week trial but in a longer term trial, after feeding vo for up to  <dig> months, both liver cholesterol and plasma ldl cholesterol were lower compared to fo  <cit> .

further to the up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes, apob- <dig> which is a component of low density lipoprotein  required for the transport of cholesterol from liver to other tissues, also showed increases in expression level, both from microarray and qpcr measurement. furthermore, from the microarray results angiopoietin-related protein  <dig>  was down-regulated in vo fed fish. angptl <dig> is a liver derived factor which suppresses lipid uptake from ldl by tissues and promotes fatty acid release from adipocytes  <cit> . thus the reduction in angptl <dig> observed in salmon fed vo is consistent with the increase in apob- <dig> and taken together indicates increases in lipid transport to tissues from liver via ldl. interestingly an apob-like protein, which is related but clearly distinct from apob- <dig> was down-regulated in vo fed fish, and a protein which is suggested to act as an "anti-freeze" in fish blood  <cit> , but which resembles apoa, another lipid transport molecule, is up-regulated in all vo. several other genes which showed changes in expression levels in vo fed fish have also been linked to lipid transport. for example cystatin, which was increased in all vo fed fish, is involved in tissue lipid uptake, suggested to be related to its role in controlling elastin and collagen breakdown in the extracellular matrix  <cit> . notably in this regard there were also decreases, in two microarray features identified as a collagen subtype, col1a <dig>  in all vo fish.

overall these changes indicate a change in the function of the liver with respect to cholesterol synthesis and distribution, with an increase in cholesterol biosynthesis and an increase the transport processes which distribute cholesterol from the liver to other tissues. in animals fed normal cholesterol in the diet, the majority of cholesterol in the liver, from endogenous or exogenous pathways, is transported in the bile, as cholesterol or as bile acids, and thence to the gut where, together with phosphatidylcholine, it assists in the uptake of dietary lipid. in this regard, levels of hepatic phosphatidylcholine and its precursor phosphatidylserine were one of the few lipid compositional measures to vary between dietary treatments. these compositional changes might be related to changes in so and ro diets of phospholipase d mrna, which encodes an enzyme which releases choline from pc. changes in bile transport, if occurring, may have consequences for lipid digestion, uptake and transport in the intestine which might explain the accumulation of lipid droplets in intestinal cells previously been observed in salmonids fed vo  <cit> . interestingly, similar intestinal lipid accumulation is observed in rodents with deficiencies in bile transport  <cit> .

also notable from the microarray data was an increase in mrna for glycogen phosphorylase  and also in expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. these systems are involved in nadph production  <cit>  and suggests that the requirement for reducing power for cholesterol and hufa biosynthesis is provided by breakdown of glycogen and up-regulation of nadph generating systems. another enzyme of importance for biosynthetic nadph production, me, was also shown to have increased activity in ro fed fish.

some reports have indicated an increase in β-oxidation in vo compared to fo fed fish  <cit> . from our microarray data we did not see increases in the expression of any genes linked to mitochondrial β-oxidation, indeed mrnas for components of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation  were decreased. furthermore, qpcr and enzymic activity measurement confirmed that cpt <dig>  an important rate limiting step in mitochondrial β-oxidation, was not significantly altered by vo feeding. however, it is known that peroxisomal β-oxidation predominates in salmon liver  <cit>  and so the mrna expression level of a critical enzyme of peroxisomal activity, acyl-coa oxidase  <cit>  was also measured. acyl-coa oxidase mrna was increased in salmon fed the lo and ro diets, and this was consistent with the increased peroxisomal β-oxidation observed in fish fed lo and ro.

of course this experiment represents a "snapshot" of gene expression  <dig> hours after final feeding and in liver only. at different prandial states and in different tissues the expression of genes for metabolic enzymes may be different. for example, shortly after feeding, when energy is in abundance, it is possible that the pentose phosphate pathway might be fuelled by gluconeogensis rather than glycogen breakdown, and these differences between fo and vo diets may be masked. with regard to fatty acid β-oxidation, sea bream exhibit differences in mitochondrial and peroxisomal activity depending on whether they are measured at  <dig> or  <dig> h after feeding  <cit> .

the microarray data also indicated down-regulation of pparγ, although, after qpcr no effect of vo feeding was apparent. ppars are critical transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and are encoded by three genes in mammals known as pparα, pparβ and pparγ <cit> . however, in salmon at six ppar genes have so far been discovered and they share considerable homology  <cit> . therefore it is possible that the microarray results reflect cross-hybridisation of different, but related transcripts, although a previous microarray study has also reported a decrease in pparγ mrna following vo feeding in salmon  <cit> . in general cdna microarrays are unlikely to be specific tools for measuring the expression of multiple closely related genes and this problem is exacerbated in atlantic salmon which have polyploid genomes, often possessing more members within each gene family than the majority of diploid vertebrates. similar issues been pointed out for the Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> fatty acyl desaturase genes which are 95% identical at the nucleotide level in salmon  <cit> .

increased lipid content, which might be an indication of health problems, in the livers of salmon fed vo has been observed previously  <cit> . in our study, although there were no significant increases in hepatic lipid, a trend for increased lipid was supported by higher tag and free fatty acid in vo fed fish and levels of mrna for a marker for intracellular lipid accumulation, adipophilin  <cit> , were increased in so and lo, supporting the idea that at least some vo diets cause increases in hepatic lipid accumulation.

finally from the microarray results, although not directly addressed by qpcr or biochemistry, were changes in the expression of genes involved in rna and protein processing and turnover. these changes may be a reflection of changes in cholesterol biosynthetic pathways and in lipid transport, reflecting a requirement to export cholesterol to tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion the present study demonstrates the utility of transcriptomic tools for studies on non-model commercially important fish species. although, there were limitations in the statistical power of the design due largely to the inherent variability amongst recently domesticated farmed atlantic salmon, by using appropriate filtering of microarray data, independent gene expression tests and biochemical and compositional data we were able to physiologically anchor a significant proportion of the gene expression results. this combined approach leads to the hypothesis that the major lipid metabolic effects of replacing fo with vo in salmon diets are mediated by srebp <dig>  a transcription factor which responds to reductions in membrane cholesterol level caused by reduced cholesterol in vo based diets. furthermore, the application of the traits/sgp microarray indicated several genes significantly altered by vegetable oils which suggest mechanisms to explain previously observed health impairment in vo fed salmon.
