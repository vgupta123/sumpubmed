BACKGROUND
plants are exposed to various abiotic and biotic stresses because of their sessile life style. therefore, for improved survival, plants develop a system that can rapidly sense signals from a changing environment and respond adaptively and/or defensively by modulating the internal physiological, biochemical, and molecular processes  <cit> . for most crops, water deficit causes a major limitation to the yield. it has been well documented that water deficit results in several physiological changes, including wilting, stomatal closure, hormone imbalance, and suppression of cell growth and photosynthesis  <cit> . after dehydration, plants are able to recover quickly once water is available again via the rehydration process .

although signal reception and the transduction pathway of dehydration have been extensively reported, they remain largely unknown for the rehydration process. using a dna microarray, oono et al.  <cit>  found that rehydration-responsive genes included genes related to both stressed status release and growth recovery in arabidopsis. in addition, ethylene-biosynthetic genes and genes responsive to jasmonic acid, gibberellin, and auxin were activated by rehydration, suggesting hormone balance is involved in the water recovery of plants.

in plants, the mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade plays an essential role in the signaling pathway of multiple abiotic and biotic stress cues . the mapk cascade is initiated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase , which reversibly phosphorylates a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase  and subsequently phosphorylates the mitogen-activated protein kinase . then, mpk phosphorylates its downstream target proteins to modulate various developmental and physiological processes  <cit> . in arabidopsis, several components of the mapk cascade, such as mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  were reported to be activated by drought  <cit> ; a recent report showed that mpk <dig> could be activated by drought, but inactivated by rehydration in arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> .

cut roses  are an important ornamental crop globally. dehydration is a considerable postharvest problem for cut roses because their market supply is highly dependent on long-distance transportation, resulting in severe dehydration for this duration. recently, we reported that in rose  flowers, rehydration following dehydration triggered rapid, but transient, ethylene production in the gynoecia, namely all the carpels and pistils in a flower  <cit> . during dehydration and rehydration, the protein level of a specific map kinase, rhmpk <dig>  was maintained at a constant high level. however, rhmpk <dig> activity was only detected within 1 h of rehydration  <cit> . furthermore, activated rhmpk <dig> phosphorylated and stabilised rhacs <dig>  a rate-limiting enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis, and resulted in an ethylene burst in gynoecia. ethylene plays an important role in flower opening and senescence in roses ; thus, we speculated that the rhmpk6-rhacs <dig> module might be crucial to sense the rehydration signal and transmit it to ethylene to regulate flower opening and senescence in roses.

previously, we found that a mapkk protein, rhmkk <dig>  could phosphorylate the rhmpk <dig> protein in vitro  <cit> . however, to date it is unknown whether rhmkk <dig> is the actual upstream component activating rhmpk <dig> in gynoecia during rehydration. in the present study, we isolated the possible mapk kinases upstream from rhmpk <dig> from roses and monitored their expression pattern during dehydration and rehydration. we found that rhmkk <dig> is the specific mapk kinase that phosphorylates rhmpk <dig> and is responsible for the rehydration-induced ethylene production in gynoecia. furthermore, methylation-sensitive pcr showed that dna methylation of the promoter of rhmkk <dig> contributes to rehydration-induced upregulation of rhmkk <dig> expression.

RESULTS
rhmkk <dig> expression is rapidly and strongly induced by dehydration in rose gynoecia
we previously reported that ethylene production could be rapidly but transiently induced by rehydration in rose gynoecia when the flowers were subjected to dehydration-rehydration treatment  <cit> . moreover, temporal- and spatial-specific activation of an rhmpk6-rhacs <dig> cascade is responsible for this rehydration-induced ethylene production  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, mpk <dig> could be activated by mapk kinases mkk2/4/5/ <dig>  <cit> . thus, we searched the rose homologues of atmkk <dig>  atmkk <dig>  atmkk <dig>  and atmkk <dig> in a rose transcriptome database  <cit> , and cloned their full-length sequences. we designated these sequences as rhmkk <dig> , rhmkk <dig> , rhmkk <dig> , and rhmkk <dig> , respectively . the full-length cdna of rhmkk <dig> is  <dig>  bp and contains a 975-bp open reading frame flanking with a 59-bp 5′-untranslated region  and a 333-bp 3′-utr. for rhmkk <dig>  rhmkk <dig>  and rhmkk <dig>  the cdna full-length was  <dig>   <dig>  and 1508 bp, respectively .fig.  <dig> alignment  and phylogenetic tree assay  of rhmkk <dig>  a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the predicted rhmkk2/4/5/ <dig> amino acid sequences and mkk homologues from various plant species. the tree was constructed using mega  <dig> . bootstrap values indicate the divergence of each branch and the scale bar represents the branch length at  <dig>  substitutions per site




to identify which mkk gene was the major contributor to rehydration-induced ethylene biosynthesis in rose gynoecia, we firstly detected the expression level of all four genes in response to dehydration and rehydration in gynoecia. rhmkk <dig> expression was induced by 24 h dehydration in gynoecia, whereas expression of rhmkk <dig> and rhmkk <dig> was almost not affected. when the flowers were subjected to rehydration, rhmkk2/4/ <dig> transcription appeared to be slightly induced 30 min after rehydration. however, rhmkk <dig> expression was rapidly and strongly induced within 30 min after rehydration. after 12 h of rehydration, rhmkk <dig> transcription decreased to a relative low level . meanwhile, rhmpk <dig> expression was retained at a relatively constant level during dehydration and rehydration, consistent with rhmpk <dig> protein accumulation in our previous report  <cit> . furthermore, rehydration-induced activation of rhmpk6-rhacs <dig> and consequently ethylene biosynthesis occurred during  <dig> –1 h of rehydration and then dropped quickly  <cit> . according to the timing of the expression, we speculated that rhmkk <dig> might be the mapk kinase responsible for the activation of the rhmpk6-rhacs <dig> cascade in rose gynoecia.fig.  <dig> expression pattern of rhmkk <dig>  rhmkk <dig>  rhmkk <dig>  rhmkk <dig>  and rhmpk <dig> in gynoecia of rose flowers during dehydration and rehydration processes. rhubi was used as an internal control. three biological replicates were tested for each time point and representative results were demonstrated




silencing of rhmkk <dig> suppressed ethylene production and petal senescence in rose flowers after dehydration and rehydration treatment
to further confirm the potential role of rhmkk <dig> in rehydration-induced ethylene production in gynoecia, we silenced rhmkk <dig> -using a virus-induced gene silencing  approach. an rhmkk9-specific fragment was chosen to construct the trv2-mkk <dig> vector to avoid cross silencing of other mkk genes. we screened positive rhmkk9-silenced flowers by detecting rna <dig>  rna <dig>  and rhmkk <dig> transcription. both rna <dig> and rna <dig> transcripts were detected in ~28% flowers, indicating that trv successfully infected these flowers. rt-pcr analysis revealed that rhmkk <dig> expression was significantly reduced in gynoecia of rhmkk9-silenced flowers than those of the trv <dig> controls, especially at 1 h after rehydration treatment . in addition, we detected rhmkk2/4/ <dig> expression in rhmkk9-silenced flowers to confirm whether their expression was affected by silencing rhmkk <dig>  as expected, rhmkk2/ <dig> expression in rhmkk9-silenced samples was similar to that in the trv <dig> controls , indicating that silencing of rhmkk <dig> did not influence the transcript accumulation of rhmkk2/ <dig>  interestingly, rhmkk <dig> transcription appeared to reduce in the silenced flowers relative to the controls. because rhmkk <dig> shared 54% homology of the nucleotide sequence with rhmkk <dig>  we assumed that the relatively low level of rhmkk <dig> should not result from the rhmkk <dig> fragment triggered cross silencing, which requires a high nucleotide sequence homology .fig.  <dig> effects of rhmkk <dig> silencing in rose flowers. a expression pattern of rhmkks and rhmpk <dig>  upper panel, semi-quantitative rt-pcr assay of rhmkk <dig>  rhmkk <dig>  rhmkk <dig>  rhmkk <dig>  and rhmpk <dig> in trv- and trv-mkk9-infected flowers. rhubi was used as an internal control. bottom panel, quantification of rhmkk <dig> expression. at least three biological replicates were tested for each time point. asterisks in the bottom panel indicated significant differences calculated using the t test . b the rhmpk <dig> phosphorylation level and rhmpk <dig> and rhacs <dig> protein levels in trv- and trv-mkk9-infected flowers. the rhmpk <dig> phosphorylation level was monitored using the phos-tag reagent. a coomassie brilliant blue-stained blot is shown below to confirm equivalent sample loading. d <dig>  dehydration for 16 h; r <dig> , r <dig>  and r <dig>  rehydration for  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 12 h, respectively




in addition, we monitored the accumulation pattern of rhmpk <dig> transcript and protein, as well as the kinase activity of rhmpk <dig> in rhmkk9-silenced flowers. we tested the rhmpk <dig> activity and protein level after 30 min of rehydration and rhacs <dig> protein level after 1 h of rehydration, respectively. this was based on the results from our previous study, which showed that the highest level of rhmpk <dig> activity and rhacs <dig> protein appeared at 30 min and 1 h of rehydration, respectively  <cit> . as expected, the transcript and protein level of rhmpk <dig> were not affected by rhmkk <dig> silencing. however, phos-tag sds-page demonstrated that rhmkk <dig> silencing largely weakened rhmpk <dig> phosphorylation during rehydration . thus, we considered that low level of rhmpk <dig> activity caused low level of rhacs <dig> protein and consequentially low ethylene production in rhmkk9-silenced flowers during rehydration. interestingly, we also detected a weak level of rhmpk <dig> kinase activity in rhmkk9-silenced lines. this could be attributed to the activity of residual rhmkk <dig> kinase because the rhmkk9-silenced lines were knock-down instead of knock-out lines. these results confirmed that rhmkk <dig> functioned upstream from rhmpk <dig> during rehydration.

next, we compared the morphological changes of rhmkk9-silenced flowers with the trv controls. on the first day after rehydration, petal loosening of the inner whorls of the trv control was more obvious than that in the rhmkk9-silenced flowers, implying that rhmkk <dig> silencing delayed the flower opening process. on the third day after rehydration, petals of the trv <dig> flowers, especially in the inner whorl, faded to a bluish colour and the petals tended to droop in side view, indicating the flowers entered the phase of senescence  . however, suppression of rhmkk <dig> expression obviously inhibited the petal bluing and drooping, implying that petal senescence was delayed . we also detected ethylene production in gynoecia of the trv control and rhmkk9-silenced flowers, respectively, during the dehydration and rehydration process. similarly to the untreated flowers, ethylene production was triggered rapidly by rehydration in gynoecia of trv control flowers  <cit>  . however, silencing of rhmkk <dig> significantly decreased the rehydration-induced ethylene production in gynoecia, indicating that rhmkk <dig> was required for the rehydration-caused increase of ethylene production in gynoecia .fig.  <dig> phenotype  and ethylene production in gynoecia  of trv control and rhmkk9-silenced flowers. at least  <dig> flowers were used for each time point. representative results are shown. asterisks indicated significant differences calculated using the t test . d <dig>  dehydration for 16 h; r <dig>  rehydration for 1 h.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> d, the day after rehydration. note, compared with the rhmkk9-silenced flower, the trv flower showed obvious senescence symptoms on d  <dig>  such as drooped  and bluing petals 




silencing of rhmkk <dig> downregulated the expression of genes associated with senescence and induced by ethylene in petals
previous reports showed that rehydration-caused ethylene production in rose gynoecia could accelerate petal senescence by regulating the expression of genes downstream to ethylene signalling  <cit> . to obtain further insights into rhmkk9-silencing-delayed petal senescence, we monitored the expression of four genes in petals of trv control and rhmkk9-silenced flowers during dehydration and rehydration. these four tested genes were all ethylene-induced and included two transcription factor genes involving abiotic response and senescence, rhwrky <dig> and rhmyb <dig>  <cit> , a senescence-associated marker gene rhsag <dig>  <cit> , as well as an unknown gene, which was highly induced by ethylene  <cit> . we found that the expression of these four genes was significantly reduced in petals of rhmkk9-silenced flowers in the first hour of rehydration than those of the trv controls . during the twelfth hour after rehydration, rhwrky <dig> and rhmyb <dig> expression in trv control flowers was decreased to a relatively low level, which was similar to that of rhmkk9-silenced flowers, possibly owing to the low ethylene production level at this time . however, rhsag <dig> expression was still significantly higher in trv controls than in rhmkk9-silenced flowers, indicating that the senescence process of trv control petals might be accelerated. these results implied that rehydration-caused ethylene production, which was a required action of rhmkk <dig>  promoted the transcript accumulation of genes related to petal senescence and resulted in earlier petal senescence.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of four ethylene-responsive genes in petals of trv control and rhmkk9-silenced flowers. at least three biological replicates were tested for each time point. asterisks in the bottom panel indicate significant differences calculated using the t test . d <dig>  dehydration for 16 h; r <dig> and r <dig>  rehydration for 1 h and 12 h, respectively




dna methylation status of the rhmkk <dig> promoter and gene body is altered during rehydration
epigenetic modification has been reported to regulate multiple tolerances of plants to environmental stresses, including heat stress, cold, and dehydration . recently, a report showed that histone modification was associated with inactivation of dehydration-inducible genes by rehydration in arabidopsis  <cit> . here, we tested the dna methylation status of the rhmkk <dig> promoter and gene body by dna methylation sensitive chop-pcr. five pairs of primers were designed to cover the ~500 bp upstream region to rhmkk <dig> orf and gene body . dna methylation-specific mcrbc digestion showed that the f1 + r <dig> region was heavily methylated during dehydration, whereas they were de-methylated when the flowers were subjected to rehydration . however, the dna methylation level of rhmkk <dig> orf, including the f2 + r <dig>  f3 + r <dig>  and f4 + r <dig> regions, was slightly elevated during rehydration . dna methylation was further tested by digestion with alu i. the results further supported that the f1 + r <dig> region of the rhmkk <dig> promoter was hypomethylated, whereas the rhmkk <dig> gene body was hypermethylated during rehydration . in general, dna methylation on the promoter region was considered to play an inhibitory role in gene transcription, whereas dna methylation on the gene body indicated the activation of gene expression  <cit> . thus, the results of the dna methylation assay further supported the gene expression analysis of rhmkk <dig> during dehydration and rehydration, revealing that the induction of rhmkk <dig> expression by rehydration might result from rehydration-caused dna demethylation in the rhmkk <dig> promoter.fig.  <dig> effects of dehydration and rehydration on dna methylation of the rhmkk <dig> gene. the effects of dehydration and rehydration on cytosine dna methylation in rhmkk <dig> gene  were determined by mcrbc digestion  and alu i-mediated  chop-pcr assays. a schematic structure of rhmkk <dig> gene. the primers used for the chop-pcr assay are indicated as f1 + r <dig>  f2 + r <dig>  f3 + r <dig>  f4 + r <dig>  and f5 + r <dig>  b

discussion
despite its simple structure, ethylene is functionally complex and plays a crucial role in a broad spectrum of plant developmental and environmental responses  <cit> . ethylene acts as an essential mediator in post-pollination fertilisation and ovule development, as well as associated petal senescence in various plants . in arabidopsis, ethylene was reported to be indispensable for fertilisation by inducing synergid cell death and establishing pollen tube block  <cit> . in phalaenopsis, a pollination-induced ethylene burst in the stigma and style ensured appropriate ovary development, and considerably promoted perianth senescence  <cit> . similarly, in carnation  flowers, removal of gynoecia repressed the production of ethylene and delayed petal senescence  <cit> .

among the various abiotic stresses, dehydration is known to influence ethylene production in plants, although the underlying regulatory mechanism seems complex. in plants such as cotton  petioles and bolls  <cit> , wheat  leaves  <cit> , orange  flowers  <cit> , as well as persimmon , and avocado  fruit, dehydration induces ethylene production  <cit> . in detached persimmon fruit, water-loss induced ethylene burst in the calyx triggered ethylene production in other tissues and accelerated fruit ripening and softening  <cit> .

in rose flowers, dehydration gradually increased ethylene production in sepals, whereas rehydration following a period of dehydration triggered rapid ethylene production in gynoecia  <cit> . moreover, the ethylene production in gynoecia, although very transient, is essential for the flower to fully open, suggesting that ethylene is naturally required for the water recovery of dehydrated flowers  <cit> . considering that continuous ethylene production is very harmful to flowers, the timing of ethylene production should be tightly regulated. biochemical analysis demonstrated that protein phosphorylation-dependent accumulation of rhacs <dig>  a rate-limiting enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis, is responsible for controlling the timing of ethylene production. in addition, rhacs <dig> protein phosphorylation is attributed to rhmpk <dig>  a map kinase, which is also precisely regulated by rehydration in rose flowers  <cit> . more important, rhmpk <dig> abundance is retained at a relatively constant level during both dehydration and rehydration, whereas rhmpk <dig> activation only occurs within 1 h of rehydration. thus, these results indicate that appropriate ethylene production is important for the natural recovery process of rose flowers during rehydration. therefore, it is not necessary for constant rhmpk <dig> accumulation during dehydration and rehydration, which is an energy-consuming process. moreover, because mapks must be activated by mapk kinases, it is reasonable to speculate that an upstream component should be involved in the rehydration-activation of rhmpk <dig> 

in arabidopsis, mpk <dig> has been reported to be activated by different mapk kinases in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . cold and salinity stress caused activation of mpk <dig> is, at least partially, dependent on mkk <dig>  <cit> , whereas mkk <dig> is required for oxidative-triggered mpk <dig>  <cit> . for drought stress, although mpk <dig> is activated by drought-induced ros accumulation  <cit> , the corresponding mapk kinase has not been identified. expression of the active version of mkk <dig> promotes mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> kinase activity and ethylene production, and enhances the sensitivity of transgenic arabidopsis to salt stress  <cit> .

here, we isolated the homologues of mkk <dig>  mkk <dig>  mkk <dig>  and mkk <dig> from roses and detected their expression during dehydration and rehydration. it is noteworthy that rhmkk <dig> expression, which could phosphorylate rhmpk <dig> in vitro  <cit> , was relatively lower during dehydration, but significantly and sharply induced at the onset of rehydration, and then rapidly decreased to similar level before rehydration. furthermore, specific silencing of rhmkk <dig> led to a significant reduction of rehydration-induced ethylene production in gynoecia. the rehydration-responsive expression pattern and function identification suggested that rhmkk <dig> is possibly the upstream component regulating the rehydration-activated rhmpk6-rhacs <dig> cascade and ethylene production in rose gynoecia. interestingly, rhmkk <dig> silencing delayed both flower opening and senescence, further supporting that rehydration-caused ethylene production accelerated flower opening and senescence. detection of gene expression showed that rehydration led to the rapid expression elevation of several ethylene-inducible genes, which were involved in abiotic stress-response and senescence, in trv control flowers. consistently, expression of ethylene-inducible genes was significantly inhibited in rhmkk9-silenced flowers. it is worth noting that the expression of two transcription factor genes, rhwrky <dig> and rhmyb <dig>  decreased after 12 h of rehydration in trv controls to a relatively low level, similarly to rhmkk9-silenced flowers. therefore, rhwrky <dig> and rhmyb <dig> might be closely associated with ethylene production. however, expression of the senescence-associated rhsag <dig> gene in the trv control was significantly higher than that in rhmkk9-silenced flowers at 12 h after rehydration, implying that rehydration-caused ethylene production might also initiate the petal senescence process.

in the last decade, increasing evidence has shown epigenetic modification plays crucial roles in tolerance, adaption, and memory of plants to various abiotic stresses . in arabidopsis, histone modification of h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac were enriched in drought stress-induced genes  <cit> . in the rehydration process, h3k9ac was rapidly removed, correlating to the inactivation of drought-inducible genes. interestingly, h3k4me <dig> was removed more slowly than the h3k9ac mark, suggesting that h3k4me <dig> may be responsible for the epigenetic memory of drought  <cit> . in rice, drought stress induced gene expression of the histone acetyltransferase  family and enhanced acetylation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig>  <cit> .

dynamic dna methylation and demethylation has also been broadly reported to be involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses . in maize, cold stress-induced zmmi <dig> gene expression is associated with dna hypomethylation in the nucleosome cores  <cit> . here, we found that rehydration also resulted in hypomethylation on the rhmkk <dig> promoter, whereas elevated methylation on the rhmkk <dig> gene body. the factors involved in this rapid methylation and de-methylation process should be the subject of further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a mapk kinase, rhmkk <dig>  is the upstream component responsible for activating the rhmpk6-rhacs <dig> cascade. rhmkk <dig> expression was specifically and rapidly induced by rehydration in gynoecia. rhmkk <dig> silencing inhibited rehydration-caused ethylene bursts and delayed flower opening and senescence. in addition, we found that changes of dna methylation status on the rhmkk <dig> promoter and gene body were associated with rhmkk <dig> induction by rehydration. these results explained how the flower, the reproductive organ, could quickly recover from dehydration using ethylene as a mediator.
