BACKGROUND
circadian rhythms are recurring fluctuations with a period of about  <dig> hours that can be observed in the physiology and behavior of most living organisms from cyanobacteria to humans  <cit> . they are controlled by an autonomous circadian clock, which can be synchronized to the environmental day-night cycle. in mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus , a structure in the ventral part of the hypothalamus, appears to be the main coordinator of the circadian timing system  <cit>  synchronizing peripheral clocks present in all tissues throughout the body  <cit> .

the oscillatory mechanism underlying the circadian clock has been unraveled by means of genetic analysis in drosophila and mammals  <cit> . in the latter, a heterodimeric complex of two transcriptional activators, clock and bmal <dig>  binds to e-box enhancer elements present in the promoters of target genes and thereby activates the expression of three period  and two cryptochrome genes . per and cry proteins translocate to the nucleus where cry proteins act as potent  inhibitors of clock-bmal1-induced transcription  <cit> . the positive  and negative  arms of the feedback loop are coupled via the nuclear orphan receptor rev-erbα  <cit>  generating a stabilized feedback loop that drives recurrent rhythms in mrna and protein levels of clock components.

transcriptional reporter assays, yeast two-hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation experiments have been successfully used to identify molecular interactions of clock components at the protein level  <cit> . interactions of bmal <dig> with clock, npas <dig>  dec <dig> and dec <dig> have been identified. furthermore it has been suggested that the transactivation activity of bmal <dig> is mediated by interaction with creb binding protein  or p <dig>  <cit> .

many different approaches have been employed to characterize the interactions between the repressors per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> and the bmal1-clock heterodimer, but still the picture is far from being clear. it is thought that cry <dig> plays a key role in repressing the transcriptional activation potential of the heterodimer, and recently, various attempts have been made to elucidate the mechanism by which interaction of cry <dig> with bmal <dig> and/or clock inhibits transcription  <cit> . however, many of these studies use multimeric protein complexes, which do not always satisfactorily identify the exact interactions between two individual components of the complex.

we decided to choose a complementary approach and to investigate the interactions of per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> with bmal <dig> and clock using a mammalian two-hybrid system where we only overexpressed two of the components – one part of the activating heterodimer and one repressor – at a time. all interactions identified in the two-hybrid system were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. our results indicate that in our conditions, cry <dig>  cry <dig> and per <dig> proteins interact with bmal <dig> by binding to different sites of bmal <dig>  but that only per <dig> interacts with clock alone. moreover, in keeping with the idea that the cry proteins are more potent inhibitors than per <dig>  we found that cry <dig> and cry <dig> both modify the interaction between per <dig> and bmal <dig>  but not vice versa.

RESULTS
interaction of per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> with bmal1
we first sought to identify the interactions between each of the repressors with bmal <dig> using a mammalian two-hybrid system. her <dig> cells were co-transfected with bmal <dig> fused to the gal <dig> dna binding domain  and either per <dig>  cry <dig> or cry <dig> fused to the activation domain of the viral protein vp <dig>  in this system, an interaction of the two clock components reconstitutes a functional transcription factor that will activate a luciferase reporter under the control of a gal4-based promoter. for gal4-bmal1/per2-vp <dig>  a 1000-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed . similar values were obtained for gal4-bmal1/cry1-vp <dig> and gal4-bmal1/cry2-vp <dig> . however, only a minimal activation of the reporter was seen when gal4-bmal <dig> was expressed alone or together with an unrelated fusion protein  or when the vp <dig> fusions were co-transfected with the gal <dig> dbd alone .

both per <dig>  and the cry proteins  could be co-immunoprecipitated from extracts of her <dig> cells co-transfected with bmal1-gfp and the respective interaction partner using an anti-gfp antibody. we therefore conclude that all three proteins are able to bind to bmal <dig>  which is in line with previous reports  <cit> . the fact that each of the three repressors can interact with bmal <dig> and thus has the potential to influence bmal1-clock mediated transcription would also explain why per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> mutant mice all display an altered expression of genes regulated by bmal <dig> and clock  <cit> .

interactions with clock
when repeating the same experiments using gal4-clock instead of gal4-bmal <dig>  we still found a 75-fold transactivation of the reporter in the case of co-transfection with per <dig> . however, co-transfection with cry1/2-vp <dig> did not induce luciferase more than transfection with gal4-clock alone . using an anti-ha antibody, were we able to co-immunoprecipitate per <dig> from extracts of cells co-transfected with per <dig> and ha-tagged clock . our results hint at a binding of per <dig>  but not cry <dig> or cry <dig>  to clock. per2-clock interactions have been observed in the scn and piriform cortex as well  <cit> .

cry, especially cry <dig>  binding to bmal <dig> has been described many times in various systems. for cry binding to clock, however, contradictory findings have been published. griffin et al. do not observe clear interactions between cry1/ <dig> and clock in a yeast two-hybrid system  <cit> , whereas shearman et al. do  <cit> . kiyohara et al.  <cit>  report that they were not able to co-immunoprecipitate clock with cry <dig> in the absence of bmal <dig>  and also in other cases bmal1/clock/cry <dig> complexes, rather than individual components, have been used to characterize interactions  <cit> . in the scn and the piriform cortex, though, cry <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with clock  <cit> , and the same group was able to demonstrate cry <dig> binding to clock in co-transfected hela cells. therefore, it appears likely that in this case the respective results depend strongly on the system and cell type used and that cell-specific factors might be involved in mediating the interaction. in the mammalian two-hybrid system we employed in her <dig> cells, cry <dig> and  <dig> do not interact with clock.

cry <dig> and cry <dig> influence the interaction between per <dig> and bmal1
since in our system, all three repressors bind to bmal <dig>  we wanted to know whether these proteins mutually influence each other's binding to bmal <dig>  we first analyzed the influence of cry <dig> and  <dig> on the interaction between per <dig> and bmal <dig>  her <dig> cells were co-transfected with gal4-bmal <dig>  per2-vp <dig> and different amounts of cry1/ <dig> expression vectors . for cry <dig>  we observed only a very slight increase in reporter luciferase activity when low amounts  of the plasmid were co-transfected, starting from  <dig> ng luciferase activity decreased markedly . when we co-transfected cry <dig>  however, the increase in reporter activity was markedly higher and sustained over a much wider dose range , a decrease was observed only with the two highest amounts of co-transfected plasmid .

our results indicate that cry <dig> and cry <dig> have different effects on per2-bmal <dig> interaction. we wished to find out whether this would still be true in the presence of clock and repeated the co-transfections as described above, but additionally co-transfected clock. we observed an overall higher reporter activity but were able to reproduce the differences between cry <dig>  and cry <dig> . a two-way anova analysis of the data showed highly significant differences between cry <dig> and cry <dig> , a highly significant dose-dependence  and an equally highly significant interaction between the two parameters .

to exclude that the modulations of reporter activity were only due to an increase or decrease in gal4-bmal <dig> or per2-vp <dig> expression, we analyzed the total expression levels of the two proteins by western blot. co-transfection of  <dig> ng- <dig> μg cry <dig> expression plasmid led to a dose-dependent increase in per2-vp <dig> expression whereas it did not influence gal4-bmal <dig> levels, co-transfection of cry <dig> caused a slight increase in both per2-vp <dig> and gal4-bmal <dig> expression only with the highest amount tested . additional co-transfection of clock had no effect on gal4-bmal <dig> levels. per2-vp <dig> expression levels were slightly elevated when clock, but not cry, was co-transfected whereas no further increase was seen with clock in the presence of cry .

a crucial role of cry proteins in the nuclear entry of per1/ <dig> has been reported  <cit> . it has also been described that cry expression has an effect on bmal <dig> localization  <cit> . since in the mammalian two-hybrid system used in this study only fusion proteins that are present in the nucleus can activate the transcription of the reporter, we determined the subcellular localization of gal4-bmal <dig> and per2-vp <dig>  to this end, we performed western blots on nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of her <dig> cells transfected as described above . the effects of cry1/ <dig> and clock basically followed the pattern observed in total extracts for both fractions, we did not detect any gross redistributions of the fusion proteins. if anything, the influence was stronger in the cytoplasm, which would not influence mammalian two-hybrid results.

in summary, fusion protein expression levels do not correlate with the degree of reporter activation, since e.g. the highest amount of cry <dig> leads to a marked increase in per2-vp <dig> expression and nonetheless significantly decreases luciferase activity. we therefore conclude that the modulations of luciferase activity we observe in the mammalian two-hybrid system reflect true modulations of per2-bmal <dig> interaction by the respective co-expressed proteins. in this scenario, clock would strengthen the interaction because the increase in luciferase activity caused by co-transfection of clock  is markedly higher than the slight increase in per2-vp <dig> expression. a similar effect has in fact been observed by kiyohara et al. for the interaction of cry <dig> with the heterodimer  <cit> . given that in our system, per <dig> interacts with both bmal <dig> and clock , a stabilization of per2-bmal <dig> interactions by clock might be envisaged through the formation of a heterotrimer where each component interacts with the other two. the increase in per2-vp <dig> expression after co-transfection of cry <dig> is very likely due to a stabilization of per2-vp <dig> by cry <dig>  an effect that has been reported before  <cit> .

cry <dig> appears to be more effective than cry <dig> in disrupting per2-bmal <dig> interactions. the observed decrease in luciferase activity is not due to less per2-vp <dig> or gal4-bmal <dig> available, on the contrary, there is clearly elevated per2-vp <dig> expression. for cry <dig>  a less pronounced increase in expression is observed, especially with low amounts of co-transfected cry <dig>  which, however, already cause a marked increase in reporter activation. of course, these effects might be cell-specific; however, they fit in with previous observations. recently, cry <dig> has been proposed as the main repressor of bmal1-clock-mediated transcription  <cit> , and previous studies in mice also show that the cry <dig> gene has a dominant role over cry <dig>  because one normal cry <dig> allele sustains normal circadian rhythms in behavior, while one cry <dig> allele leads to arrhythmicity  <cit> . since the per proteins have been reported to be weaker repressors than cry1/ <dig>  <cit> , the ability of cry <dig>  to disrupt per2-bmal <dig> interactions might be important to allow stronger repression of the transcription activation potential of the heterodimer.

per <dig> does not significantly affect the interaction between cry and bmal1
if the cry proteins, especially cry <dig>  act as the main repressors, per <dig> should not be able to destabilize the interactions between the cry proteins and bmal <dig>  preliminary experiments showed that co-transfection of small amounts of per <dig> indeed did not reduce cry1/2-bmal1-mediated luciferase activation in the mammalian two-hybrid system . to further test this hypothesis, we co-transfected cry1/2-vp <dig> together with gal4-bmal <dig> and an excess of per <dig>  since the dna amount that can be transfected is limited, we decreased the amounts of co-transfected cry1/2-vp <dig> rather than increased that of per <dig>  for cry <dig>  as well as for cry <dig>  we found a dose-dependent reduction in luciferase activity as co-transfected plasmid amount decreased, both in the presence  and the absence  of per <dig>  co-transfection of per <dig> actually increased luciferase activity instead of diminishing it, which might hint at a stabilization of cry-bmal <dig> interactions by per <dig>  alternatively, it could be due to increased protein expression or nuclear availability of the fusion proteins; we were, however, not able to determine expression levels of the fusion proteins in this experimental set-up. the currently transfected amounts of cry1/2-vp <dig> were too low to yield any signal in a western blot, and we were not able to increase them in a way that would allow a detection of the lowest amount without exceeding the transfection limit with the highest amount, which is 50-fold higher. we tried to at least assess the influence of co-transfection of per <dig> on the expression levels of gal4-bmal <dig> and cry1/2-vp <dig> using only one amount of each expression plasmid. per <dig> co-expression did not affect cry1/2-vp <dig> levels and had only a small effect on gal4-bmal <dig> expression, which was slightly decreased . consequently, the increase in luciferase activity observed when per <dig> is co-transfected very likely is not due to elevated fusion protein levels.

although in our system, we could not detect any interaction between cry <dig> and clock, it has been described in other systems, indicating that clock might have an impact on cry1-bmal <dig> interaction. indeed, when we co-transfected increasing amounts of clock expression plasmid together with gal4-bmal <dig> and cry1-vp <dig>  we observed a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity  whereas gal4-bmal <dig> and cry1-vp <dig> expression levels remained almost constant . clock thus appears to stabilize the interaction, possibly by inducing conformational changes in bmal <dig> that facilitate cry <dig> binding. as for per <dig>  a heterotrimer might be formed that is more stable than the cry1-bmal <dig> complex alone, even in the absence of direct cry1-clock interactions. the results of kiyohara et al.  <cit>  support a heterotrimer formation as well, since they co-immunoprecipitate cry <dig> with clock only in the presence of bmal <dig> 

lee et al. report impaired nuclear translocation of cry proteins in the livers of per1/per <dig> double mutant mice  <cit> , and it has been demonstrated that per <dig> lacking the nuclear localization signal can retain cry proteins in the cytoplasm  <cit> . however, overexpressed cry <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to be nuclear proteins in cells  <cit> . co-transfection of  per <dig> should therefore in principle not influence the sub-cellular localization of at least the cry proteins. to our knowledge, no dependence of sub-cellular localization of bmal <dig> on per <dig> has been reported, either, and since bmal <dig> is a predominantly nuclear protein  <cit> , its nuclear availability should not drastically vary. thus, we did not perform any cell fractionations for cry1/2-vp <dig> and gal4-bmal <dig> 

per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> bind different domains of bmal1
to map the regions of the bmal <dig> protein that are critical for interactions with cry1/ <dig> and per <dig> we constructed three deletion mutants of bmal <dig> fused to the gal <dig> dbd . we confirmed that their expression levels were comparable to those of full-length gal4-bmal <dig>  and tested their capacity to activate the luciferase reporter in the mammalian two-hybrid system when co-expressed together with per2-vp <dig>  cry1-vp <dig> or cry2-vp <dig>  respectively.

co-transfection of gal4-bmal1Δc-term with per2-vp <dig> led to a strong increase in luciferase activity , indicating that the c-terminus of bmal <dig> is not essential for per <dig> binding. cry1-vp <dig> was also able to augment luciferase activity significantly above background; however, the effect was not as strong as that observed with per2-vp <dig> . no significant increase was observed for cry2-vp <dig>  we therefore conclude that cry <dig> is still able to weakly interact with this truncated version of bmal <dig>  whereas cry <dig> binding is completely abolished .

when we tested gal4-bmal1Δpas b/c-term, a deletion mutant lacking not only the c-terminus but also the pas b domain, only co-transfection with per2-vp <dig> led to a slight  elevation in luciferase activity. neither cry1-vp <dig> nor cry2-vp <dig> had any statistically significant effect . per <dig> consequently still appears to be able to bind to this bmal1-mutant, although to a much lesser extent than to gal4-bmal1Δc-term, which indicates that the pas domain of bmal <dig> might be involved in per <dig> binding. it also seems to play a role in cry <dig> binding since the residual reporter transactivation observed with gal4-bmal1Δc-term and cry1-vp <dig> disappears when the deletion in bmal <dig> is extended to the pas b domain.

gal4-bmal1Δhlh/pas a was able to activate the luciferase reporter to a considerable extent already in the absence of any vp <dig> fusion protein. co-transfection with all three vp <dig> fusion constructs thus caused only slight, but nonetheless significant, increases in luciferase activity . although it is difficult to draw any conclusions due to the high background activity of this bmal <dig> mutant, these results confirm the observations made using the other two truncated forms, namely that the n-terminal portion of bmal <dig> appears to be most important for per <dig> binding, less crucial for the binding of cry <dig> and not essential for interactions with cry <dig> 

in summary, our interaction data leads to a model where per <dig> binds to the n-terminus of bmal <dig>  where the pas a domain is located. since per <dig> itself also contains a pas domain, a direct interaction between these two domains could be envisaged. cry <dig> would bind more towards the pas b domain and cry <dig> even further c-terminally. this hypothesis is in line with observations of kiyohara et al.  <cit>  who report normal binding of per <dig>  but not of cry <dig>  to a c-terminally truncated version of bmal <dig>  others have also identified mutations in the c-terminus of bmal <dig> that weaken bmal1-cry <dig> interactions  <cit> . to our knowledge, the binding site for cry <dig> has not been mapped in bmal <dig> so far. however, given that cry <dig> was less effective than cry <dig> in disrupting per2-bmal <dig> interactions in our system, it can be expected to be further away than the binding site for cry <dig>  which, in our model, would actually be the case.

cbp and p <dig>  transcriptional co-activators found to interact with bmal <dig>  have also been hypothesized to bind to the extreme c-terminus that harbors a putative transcription activation domain  <cit> . thus, the fact that cry <dig> and cry <dig> bind more c-terminally to bmal <dig> than per <dig> might also explain why they have a stronger capacity to inhibit bmal1-clock-mediated transcriptional activation.

confirmation of the interactions in cos- <dig> cells
we were not able to confirm the interactions identified in the mammalian two-hybrid system by co-immunoprecipitation of in vitro transcribed/translated proteins . this might be due either to the presence of bridging proteins in her <dig> cells or to post-translational modifications of the interaction partners, which are vital for circadian clock function in vivo  <cit> . we tried to precipitate one in vitro expressed interaction partner together with one expressed in her <dig> cells in order to reconstitute potential post-translational modifications on at least one of the proteins. however, in our hands, this was not possible either , indicating that modifications of both partners might be necessary for interactions.

as the primary interaction partners of clock components are other clock components, we wanted to find out whether clock genes, whose products might act as bridging proteins, were endogenously expressed in her <dig> cells. we performed rt-pcr for hper <dig>  hper <dig>  hbmal <dig>  hclock, hcry <dig> and hcry <dig> and were indeed able to detect transcripts of all six genes . we did not detect any expression on the protein level, however . still, this does not necessarily mean that they are truly absent because their levels might just be below the detection limit. consequently, it cannot be excluded that endogenous oscillator components are present and contribute to the interactions observed in her <dig> cells. we therefore tried to reproduce our results in cos- <dig> cells that have been reported to express hardly any endogenous clock genes  <cit> .

we performed the mammalian two-hybrid assay as described above to identify interactions of per2-vp <dig>  cry1-vp <dig> and cry2-vp <dig> with gal4-bmal <dig> and gal4-clock, respectively. as in her <dig> cells, all three vp <dig> fusions were able to significantly increase luciferase activity when co-transfected with gal4-bmal <dig> . this increment was not observed when they were co-expressed with the gal <dig> dbd or when gal4-bmal <dig> was co-transfected with vp <dig> . thus, per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> interact with bmal <dig> also in cos- <dig> cells.

gal4-clock activated the reporter to such a high extent already in the absence of interaction partners that no further significant increase in luciferase activity could be detected upon co-expression of per2-vp <dig>  cry1-vp <dig> or cry2-vp <dig> .

to be able to analyze interactions with clock, we constructed plasmids that encoded fusions of the gal <dig> dbd to per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig> and a fusion of vp <dig> to clock and repeated the two-hybrid assay. neither one of the gal <dig> dbd fusion proteins caused a more than 10-fold increase in luciferase activity as compared to the reporter alone. when clock-vp <dig> was co-transfected, significantly enhanced  activity values were only observed for gal4-per <dig>  indicating that indeed only per <dig> interacts directly with clock. co-transfection of gal4-cry <dig> with clock-vp <dig> also led to higher luciferase values; however, there were considerable inter-experimental variations, and moreover, luciferase activity was already elevated when vp <dig> alone was co-transfected. this hints at an interaction between cry <dig> and vp <dig> rather than between cry <dig> and clock. the difference in luciferase activity between co-transfection of clock-vp <dig> and vp <dig> was not statistically significant .

we wished to confirm the results obtained using the new plasmids in her <dig> cells and performed the same two-hybrid assay as in cos- <dig> cells. in this cell line, however, all three gal <dig> dbd fusion proteins in combination with clock-vp <dig> significantly augmented reporter activity levels .

since the interaction between cry <dig> and clock can only be observed in her <dig> cells, and only when using gal4-cry <dig> and clock-vp <dig> but not with gal4-clock and cry2-vp <dig> , we think that it might actually be an artefact arising from an interaction of cry <dig> with endogenous per <dig> and/or bmal <dig> that, in turn, interacts with clock-vp <dig>  since for cry <dig> and clock, the results were not quite clear in cos- <dig> cells, either, we co-transfected her <dig> cells with cry <dig> and ha-clock and tried to co-immunoprecipitate cry <dig> with an anti-ha antibody, which did not work, however . we therefore believe that also this alleged direct interaction is rather indirect and mediated by endogenous per <dig> and/or bmal <dig> 

co-transfection of the newly generated gal <dig> fusion constructs with bmal1-vp <dig> confirmed the results obtained previously both in her <dig> and in cos- <dig> cells. all three proteins, gal4-per <dig>  gal4-cry <dig> and gal4-cry <dig>  caused a significant increased in luciferase activity when co-expressed together with bmal1-vp <dig> .

in summary, our two-hybrid assays in cos- <dig> cells confirm the interactions identified using the same system in her <dig> cells, namely per2-bmal <dig>  per2-clock, cry1-bmal <dig> and cry2-bmal <dig>  we still cannot exclude the involvement of endogenous bridging proteins that are present in both cell lines. however, the fact that the interactions still take place in a cell line devoid of endogenous clock genes strongly argues against the notion that endogenous clock components are necessary to stabilize the observed interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we identify interactions between bmal <dig> and clock, the two components of the positive feedback loop of the mammalian circadian clock, and the repressors per <dig>  cry <dig> and cry <dig>  we show that per <dig> binds to both bmal <dig> and clock whereas in our system, cry <dig> and cry <dig> are only able to bind to bmal <dig>  these interactions can be observed in transfected cells also in the absence of endogenous clock proteins, but not in vitro, indicating that post-translational modifications of the interaction partners and/or not clock-related bridging proteins are necessary to stabilize them. analysis of deletion mutants of bmal <dig> reveals that per <dig> interacts with n-terminal regions, in contrast to cry <dig> and cry <dig> that both need c-terminal motifs to be able to bind to bmal <dig> . the cry proteins moreover seem to have a higher affinity to bmal <dig> than per <dig>  taken together, our results provide new insights into the interactions between activating and repressing components of the circadian clock. they also confirm the notion that the cry proteins are more potent inhibitors of bmal1-clock mediated transcriptional activation than the per proteins, which might be due both to their higher affinity to bmal <dig> and their binding to the c-terminus of bmal <dig>
