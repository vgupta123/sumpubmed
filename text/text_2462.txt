BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  are pluripotent cells that have been reported to reside in virtually all postnatal organs and tissues . they are defined by their ability to adhere to plastic, to differentiate into bone, cartilage and fat, and by expression of specific sets of cell-surface markers. the apparent plasticity of mscs within the bone marrow and their similarity to subendothelial pericytes have lead to suggestions that these two cell types are closely related and possibly even the same  <cit> . pericytes and actively proliferating mscs both express alpha-smooth muscle actin , a marker of vascular smooth muscle cells, and both cell types reside within the domain of the microcirculation  <cit> . the pluripotential nature of mscs has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. when systemically injected, mouse mscs migrate to multiple tissues and differentiate into parenchymal cells of muscle, cartilage, skin, bone, liver, heart, brain, intestine and lung  <cit> . in vitro, defined conditions promote the differentiation of mscs into skeletal muscle, endothelial cells, neurons, and cardiac myocytes in addition to bone, cartilage and fat  <cit> . it has been proposed that mscs contribute to tissue and organ repair and have therapeutic potential in the regeneration or repair of multiple target tissues  <cit> . several clinical trails have been launched to evaluate mscs for the treatment of musculoskeletal, neurological and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> .

the process of msc aging is important from the perspective of tissue regeneration and repair because there is evidence that these beneficial functions may become handicapped with age. age-related decline in the number of mscs in the bone marrows of rodents, monkeys, and humans have been reported  <cit> . most studies to date focused on the effects of aging on the ability of mscs to enter osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic programs. some, but not all studies suggest that aging reduces osteogenesis and chondrogenesis while enhancing adipogenic potential  <cit> . these changes could provide an attractive explanation for the increased adiposity of bone marrow that is seen with age, and may be a factor in senile osteoporosis  <cit> . other studies including some on humans suggest that the adipogenic potential of mscs increases at mid-age but declines in old age  <cit> . programs of senescence have been extensively studied particularly during passage of human mscs, and these may provide clues to the mechanism of age-related decline of mscs in the bone marrow  <cit> . however it is not known how aging affects growth factor, cell cycle or tumor suppressor genes despite the possible relevance to senescence and self-renewal. in fact to date there has been no comprehensive effort to analyze the effect of age on global gene expression of non-committed mscs. in the present study, we harvested bone marrow from mice aged  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> months, and obtained homogenous populations of mscs from each age group. comparisons of the transcription profiles of these mscs reveal significant age-related changes in the expression of more than  <dig> genes. we found that marker genes associated with adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation displayed a generalized decline with age. there were parallel declines of the cell cycle inhibitors p <dig> and p <dig>  and the growth factors vegf and hgf. these observations suggest that molecular genetic changes accumulate in bone marrow mscs during aging that may affect functions, including differentiation and proliferation of these cells.

methods
cell culture and isolation
mesenchymal stem cells  were isolated from c57bl/ <dig> wt mice aged  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> months as described  <cit> . briefly, femur and tibia were removed from both legs, four mice per age group, and the bone marrow flushed with culture medium using a syringe needle. the cells were filtered through a 70-micron strainer and centrifuged at  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes. red blood cell lysis buffer  was added, and the cells were plated on falcon tissue culture plates in mouse mesenchymal stem cell basal media with supplements . non-adherent cells were removed by rinsing and replacing the media after  <dig> hours and culture medium was replaced every  <dig> days. at  <dig> days post-harvest, the cells were removed with  <dig> % trypsin-edta solution  and replated on new culture plates at a dilution of 1: <dig> . non-detached cells were discarded. media was replaced twice weekly and cells were grown for  <dig> passages before harvest.

flow cytometry
cells were resuspended at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml in pbs containing 2% fetal bovine serum,  <dig> mm edta, and  <dig> % sodium azide  and incubated at 4°c for  <dig> minutes with apc-or pe-conjugated antibodies against cell surface markers sca- <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd11b . labeled cells were centrifuged, resuspended in  <dig>  ml of facs buffer, and analyzed using an lsrs <dig> flow cytometer and quantified with cellquest software.

rna isolation
passage  <dig> mscs from each age group were harvested at the same degree of confluence using identical procedures. rna was purified using trireagent , and qiagen rneasy columns following the manufacturer's instructions. rna integrity and concentration were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis, uv nanodrop spectrophotometry.

microarray
equal amounts of rna from  <dig> animals per age group were combined to generate a pooled sample for each experimental group. the pooled rna samples were labeled for hybridization to the affymetrix mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  genechip array, using standard affymetrix protocols. this chip contains roughly  <dig>  transcripts. a total of  <dig> chips were run including triplicates of 2-month samples and quadruplicates of  <dig> month and  <dig> month samples. arrays were pre-hybridized with 1× hybridization buffer for  <dig> minutes at 45°c. the labeled samples were added to the genechip arrays and hybridized for  <dig> hours at 45°c. the arrays were stained and washed according to affymetrix fluidics station  <dig> protocol eukgews2v5_ <dig>  the intensity values were collected from the genechips by scanning the arrays with a genechip scanner  <dig> 7g. the resultant images were analyzed with the mas <dig> algorithm for quality control checks. pearson correlation coefficients taken from plotting signal intensity values of duplicate chips across all genes validated that triplicate experiments were similar . chip intensity values were calculated using the gcrma algorithm. chips were normalized with the quantile normalization procedure. normalized expression values from the raw data were generated using default settings for the gc-robust multi-array average  method that provides the best balance of accuracy and precision  <cit>  within genespring . subsequent statistical analysis was also performed in genespring. the cross-gene error model was applied with replicates. the acceptance criterion for gene array expression changes was a minimum fold change of  <dig>  and a t-test p-value of <  <dig> . venn diagrams and scatter plots were generated within genespring.

western blotting
western blots were performed using previously described protocols  <cit> . briefly, equal amounts of proteins were fractionated on 10% sds-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose . blots were stained with ponceau red to monitor the transfer of proteins. membranes were blocked with 5% milk and incubated with p <dig> and actin antibodies  overnight at 4°c. blots were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence .

quantitative rt-pcr
rna was reverse-transcribed using an rt <dig> pcr array first strand kit  with random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions. power sybr green pcr master mix  was used according to manufacturer's instructions. the reaction mixtures were run in 96-well rt <dig> profiletm pcr arrays  each containing primers for  <dig> genes. detection was performed using an abi prism 7900ht fast sequence detector system, and data analysis was carried out using the software provided. cycle thresholds for each transcript  were related to the relative standard curve. ct values were compared from different age groups and the mean and standard errors were calculated from two separate rna extractions run in duplicate. statistical analysis was carried out using a standard t-test.

differentiation assays
osteogenesis: confluent monolayers of each cell group were incubated in osteoblast differentiation media containing dmem-low glucose , 10% heat-inactivated fbs, 1% penicillin-streptomycin,  <dig> mm beta-glycerophospate,  <dig>  μm dexamethasone, and  <dig>  mm ascorbic acid 2-phosphate  <cit> . the culture media was replaced every  <dig> days and after  <dig> days the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with alizarin red s . adipogenesis: confluent monolayers of each cell group were incubated in adipogenic induction medium consisting of dmem-low glucose  supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum , 1% penicillin-streptomycin,  <dig> μm dexamethasone,  <dig>  mm ibmx,  <dig> μm indomethacin, and  <dig> mg/ml insulin. after 6-days the medium was switched to adipogenesis maintenance media consisting of basal media 10% heat-inactive fbs, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and insulin. cultures were alternated weekly between induction media and maintenance media for  <dig> more weeks and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with oil-red-o . control plates were incubated in parallel with dmem-low glucose supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fbs and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and subjected to the same fixing and staining procedures.

RESULTS
characterization of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , early passage cultures were heterogeneous with cells displaying spindle-shaped, flat, and fibroblast-like morphologies ). during passage, cells with a flattened morphology were retained and were visually predominant by passage  <dig> . passage  <dig> cells were characterized by facs analysis for the expression of sca- <dig>  cd <dig>  cd11b and cd <dig> . sca- <dig> and cd <dig> are cell surface markers previously assigned to mouse mscs. cd11b is a marker for granulocytes, monocytes, and natural killer cells and cd <dig> for hematopoietic lineage cells. consistent with an msc phenotype, all cells were sca- <dig> and cd <dig> positive  and negative for cd11b and cd <dig> . to confirm facs cells were fixed stained with fluorescent lagged sca- <dig> and cd <dig> antibodies. msc from all ages were positive for these markers ).

age-related decline of msc osteogenic differentiation
cultures from each age group were exposed to osteogenic differentiation as described in methods. figure  <dig> shows representative plates of cells stained with alizarin red s after differentiation treatments. all differentiated cultures stained positive  whereas no stain was detected in the controls . microscopic visualization identified >95% of cells from each age as positive for alizarin red s after  <dig> days exposure to differentiation medium . these results indicate that cells from all age groups were competent for osteogenic differentiation. to quantify osteogenic differentiation we measured secreted alkaline phosphates 10-days after exposure to differentiation medium as described in methods. as shown in figure  <dig> there was a progressive decline in alkaline phosphatase secreted, with 26-mo cells secreting ~25% compared with 2-mo cells. these results suggest that the potential for osteogenic differentiation declines with age. to determine whether the cells were competent for adipogenesis mscs from each age group were exposed to adipogenic differentiation medium for  <dig> days, stained with oil-red-o and examined microscopically for cytoplasmic lipid droplets. consistent with previous work in murine as well as human mscs, we found that adipogenic differentiation decreased with passage number  <cit> . clusters of cells with lipid droplets, positive for oil-red-o were found in mscs of all age groups at passage number  <dig> or less . however adipogenic potential was lost with increasing passage; when mscs from each age group were subjected to adipogenic differentiation conditions at passage >  <dig>  only mscs from 8-month old mice differentiated . interestingly mscs from 8-month old mice also expressed the highest levels of adipogenic markers .

distinct non-overlapping trends in gene expression during phases of aging
results of microarray analyses using the affymetrix mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> and tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . hierarchical clustering of mrnas from each set of time points indicated excellent reproducibility between samples . venn diagrams of differentially expressed genes using a threshold of 2-fold are shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> transcripts declined between  <dig> and  <dig> months and  <dig> transcripts between  <dig> and  <dig> months. eighty-six transcripts corresponding to  <dig> genes were common to both groups.  <dig> transcripts were elevated in the 2- to 8-month group and  <dig> in the 8- to 26-month group; there was no overlap between these groups. the low degree of overlap between groups indicates that transcripts that change significantly during 2- <dig> months do not continue to change in the same direction during 8- <dig> months, but rather remain at the 8-month level, whereas different sets of transcripts change during 8- <dig> months. scatter plots indicating up and down-regulated genes are shown in figure  <dig> 

age-related trends in differentiation, growth factor and cell cycle genes by cluster analysis
differentially expressed genes between  <dig> and  <dig> months
a series of osteogenic, homeobox, and integrin gene transcripts decreased significantly between  <dig> and 8-months, see table  <dig> . the osteogenic markers included, osteoadherin , periostin osteoblast specific factor , osteoglycin , osteonectin , osteonitogen , and osteoblast stimulating factor . down-regulated integrins included, integrin α- <dig> , α- <dig> , α- <dig> , α- <dig> , and β- <dig> ; integrin linked kinase  and adams- <dig> also decreased by 3-fold. adams are transmembrane proteins that have metalloprotease, integrin-binding, intracellular signaling and cell adhesion activities  <cit> . down-regulated homeobox genes included homeobox msh-like , homeobox b <dig> , paired-related homeobox , homeobox b <dig> , homeobox  <dig> , and hoxb <dig> . the levels of tgfβ signaling pathway transcripts tgf-β <dig> and the receptor endoglin increased. endoglin is an accessory receptor for several growth factors of the tgfβ family that is expressed in adult bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . igf-1bp <dig> and igf-2bp <dig> transcripts were also increased between  <dig> and  <dig> months. there were increases of lipoprotein lipase  and collagen type-viia . lpl is a marker of adipogenesis; col7a is a component of the epidermal basement membrane  <cit> .

differentially expressed genes between  <dig> and  <dig> months
cell cycle regulators and apoptosis
microarray analysis revealed significant declines in the transcripts encoding cell cycle regulators trp <dig> , cdkn1a , chek <dig> and retinoblastoma gene product , and multiple apoptosis genes over the entire 2- <dig> month period. these trends were confirmed by rtpcr using a cancer pathway superarray, ). p <dig> and p <dig> transcript levels decreased by  <dig> and 50-fold respectively. chek <dig> transcripts decreased by 2-fold and rb <dig> by 4-fold. fas decreased by 2-fold and bax, bad, caspase  <dig>  and apaf <dig> by 2-4-fold. when the same superarray was used to compare transcripts from hearts of 2-month versus 24-month mice only minor age-related changes were observed in these transcript . western analyses were implemented to determine whether the changes in p <dig> were reflected at the protein level. as shown in figure  <dig>  p <dig> was reduced at 8-months compared with 2-months and was almost undetectable at  <dig> months. in contrast there was no change of p <dig> expression in the spleen of  <dig> month versus 24-month mice .

growth factors
microarray analysis identified five pro-angiogenic growth factor genes with decreased expression during aging, hgf, igf- <dig>  vegf-a and c and angiopoietin- <dig> . these changes were confirmed by rtpcr . e2f <dig> and the vegf receptor flt <dig> were elevated in 26-month cells . it is noteworthy that all of the gene expression changes detected by the microarray analysis that were represented in the rt-pcr arrays were confirmed, and quantification of individual transcripts was usually within the same range. to confirm mrna transcript results we measured vegf protein levels by elisa . vegf secretion by 26-month mscs was significantly reduced in 8-and 26-month cells.

discussion
we compared global gene transcriptional profiles of uncommitted bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells from mice at  <dig> different ages and across  <dig> intervals of the murine lifespan. changes of gene expression occurring between  <dig> and  <dig> months have little in common with those between  <dig> and  <dig> months. the small overlap of down-regulated transcripts  and no overlap of up-regulated genes , is consistent with the biologically distinct stages represented by these time periods that correspond roughly to young, mature, and aged. an important and novel aspect of this study is that distinctive patterns of gene expression were apparent between the cells despite  <dig> passages and culture for 6-weeks in defined msc proliferation medium. the cells were cultured in parallel under identical conditions, harvested at the same degree of confluence and displayed homogeneity as reflected by similar cell-surface markers at the time of rna isolation. therefore, it seems likely that the differences in transcript profiles are age-related and reflect molecular genetic modifications that are retained during cell division.

despite reciprocal changes in the transcript levels of multiple genes including those associated with tgf-β and igf- <dig> signaling pathways over the 2- <dig> month and 8- <dig> month periods, there was an overall trend of decreased osteogenic and adipogenic marker expression over the entire 2- to 26-month period of aging. the increase of lpl transcripts apparent between  <dig> and  <dig> months was lost at  <dig> months in parallel with a dramatic decline of fabp <dig> transcripts. the osteogenic and homeobox markers that declined between  <dig> and  <dig> months remained depressed at  <dig> month. several bone morphogenic protein  family transcripts including bmp- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  bmp receptor-1b, and bmp activation membrane bound inhibitor were elevated at  <dig> months. however multiple other osteogenic markers that declined in the 2- <dig> month age group did not recover. integrins and smooth muscle-related transcripts  decreased during 2- <dig> months and increased again at  <dig> months, whereas transcripts of sfrp <dig>  a key component of wnt signaling, and a possible modulator of osteogenic versus adipogenic differentiation  <cit>  decreased progressively. these results are consistent with declines in osteogenic and perhaps adipogenic potential with age, although passage number may be more important than age for the latter. the results are also consistent with previous reports that osteogenesis and adipogenesis decline with age and passage of murine mscs  <cit> . the situation may be different in humans where mscs from aged subjects display more rapid senescence in culture, but do not appear to have reduced osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation potentials at least at early passage in culture  <cit> .

as noted above, only  <dig> gene transcripts were down regulated over the entire 2- <dig> month period. importantly, these down-regulated transcripts included multiple cell cycle and growth factor genes. vegf, hgf and igf- <dig> were all significantly decreased in mscs from 26-month old mice relative to cells from either  <dig> or 8-months . rt-pcr confirmed 4- and 3-fold decreases of vegf-a and -c respectively, 272-fold decrease of hgf, and 22-fold decrease of igf- <dig> transcripts over 2- <dig> months . elisa further confirmed the decrease of vegf secretion of cells from aged mice   <cit> . p <dig> inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  causing cell cycle arrest in g <dig>  if dna is successfully repaired, p <dig> is degraded and cell division can be restarted. in somatic cells the p53/p <dig> pathway is progressively activated during aging as telomeres are lost and cells accumulate dna damage, eventually promoting senescence  <cit> . conversely, the p53-pathway is inactive in >50% of oncogenically transformed cells accounting at least in part for the resistance of these cell to senescence  <cit> . in embryonic stem cells  p <dig> is expressed at low levels and does not induce p <dig> because translocation to the nucleus is blocked . therefore escs also evade p53-mediated senescence. genome integrity in escs is maintained by enhanced telomerase activity, efficient dna repair, and highly active p53-independent apoptosis  <cit> . our observations that aged msc lost expression of p <dig> and p <dig>  as well chek <dig>  may explain how these cells avoid age-related senescence. loss of rb <dig> may also contribute to this; rb, p <dig> and p <dig> are all required for replicative senescence of primary somatic cells  <cit> . these results may also be quite relevant to oncogenesis; an age-related loss of p <dig> may predispose these cells to oncogenic transformation, perhaps generating cancer stem cells  <cit> . aging is a well-established risk factor for oncogenesis  <cit> . the relevance of flt <dig> induction is not clear, however it has been reported that bone marrow derived hematopoietic progenitor cells that express high levels of flt <dig> have an enhanced potential to home to tissues that express vegf  <cit> .

there have been conflicting reports on the effect of age on the adipogenic potential of msc . muraglia et al  <cit>  isolated  <dig> clones of human mscs and showed that  <dig> of these differentiated along an osteogenic lineage, whereas fewer clones showed chondrogenic or adipogenic potential, and the potentials of the latter decreased with passage number. msc from human adipose were also reported to become more osteogenic at late passage  <cit> . other studies suggest that age affects senescence but not differentiation potential of human mscs  <cit> . msc from rats rapidly loose chondrogenic potential during aging from immature to mature or old, and this is paralleled by lower basal expression of related genes  <cit> . there is also evidence that mesenchymal stem cells committed to an adipogenic program can be induced to trans-differentiate to the osteogenic pathway and vice versa  <cit> . moreman et al  <cit>  reported recently that freshly isolated bone marrow of 26-month old mice contains significantly greater numbers of cells committed to the adipogenic lineage than does the bone marrow of 8-month mice. these changes were paralleled by increased adipogenic and decreased osteogenic marker gene transcripts. these studies do not necessarily conflict with our findings because moreman et al studied freshly isolated cells whereas we used passaged cells. culture in vitro may eliminate or reverse the programming of cells that are committed at the time of isolation  <cit> . we found that transcript levels of osteogenic markers decreased between  <dig> and  <dig> months whereas adipogenic markers increased at 8-months but decreased at 26-months. differentiation studies were consistent with a biological consequence of these changes . these trends are reminiscent of the aging process in humans where adiposity tends to increase at mid-age while both adiposity and osteogenicity decrease during old age  <cit> . of note mice aged 8-months are equivalent to a human age between 30- <dig> whereas a 26-month old mouse is equivalent to > <dig> human years  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our studies indicate dramatic changes in the expression of multiple genes during aging with some of the greatest fluctuations represented by adipogenic and osteogenic markers, growth factors and cell cycle regulator genes. major trends included higher adipogenic gene markers and lower osteogenic markers at 8-months compared with 2-months, loss of adipogenic markers at 26-months, and globally decreased transcripts for growth factors and cell cycle regulators p <dig> and p <dig> over the entire aging period. the results suggest that maturation and aging of the bone marrow define distinctive gene expression patterns that effect both tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. the loss of growth factor, survival, and cell cycle control genes implies that aged mscs may loose some of their migration and repair properties while avoiding age-induced senescence. the retention of age-determined expression profiles of tissue specific genes during passage in vitro suggests that certain gene sets may be irreversibly affected by aging in vivo, such that they are refractive to reprogramming signals after isolation.
