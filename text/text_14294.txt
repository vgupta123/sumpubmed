BACKGROUND
agrestal weeds are the major biotic cause for crop yield losses  <cit> . most weeds are annual or short-lived wild plant species. they thrive in agricultural ecosystems because they have evolved traits enabling them to withstand crop competition and cultural practices, including herbicide applications, aimed at disrupting their demography  <cit> . understanding weed success requires unravelling the genetic basis of these traits, a task far from being achieved today  <cit> . prominent among those traits is resistance to herbicides that has now evolved in  <dig> weed species  <cit>  in response to the powerful and recurrent selective pressure exerted by herbicide applications  <cit> . the evolution of herbicide resistance in weed populations can ultimately result in the disruption of herbicide efficacy, leading to crop failure  <cit> .

basically, mechanisms of resistance to herbicides can be categorised into two classes according to their genetic control  <cit> . monogenic resistance is governed by allele of a single gene, while polygenic resistance is governed by allele of a set of genes, with “allele” meaning a variant of a wild-type gene displaying differences in its protein-coding sequence and/or its regulatory region  <cit> . target-site-based resistance endowed by mutations at the gene encoding the herbicide target protein is an example of monogenic resistance that is now well elucidated in weeds  <cit> . non-target-site based resistance  endowed by mechanisms neutralising the herbicide or compensating for its action is most often a case of polygenic resistance  <cit> . ntsr can confer resistance to herbicides with different modes of action and is considered the most agronomically noxious type of herbicide resistance  <cit> . ntsr is overall the most widespread and frequent type of resistance in grass weeds  <cit> . the literature available suggests that ntsr mechanisms are part of the pathways involved in the response of weed plants to the herbicide stress. accordingly, ntsr is considered to be largely driven by inheritable differences in the expression patterns of one or more genes between resistant and sensitive plants  <cit> . these differences can be constitutive and/or induced by herbicide application  <cit> . cytochromes p <dig>  glutathione-s-transferases, glycosyltransferases, esterases, abc transporters and/or peroxidases have been shown to play a major role in herbicide response and in ntsr . while a few ntsr genes belonging to these families have recently been identified , the majority of the genetic mechanisms underlying ntsr remain to be elucidated  <cit> .

elucidating the genetic basis of ntsr requires being able to unravel the genetic bases of herbicide stress response in weeds, and to identify genetic differences between resistant and sensitive plants before and after herbicide application  <cit> . this is now feasible thanks to the tremendous development of the next-generation sequencing technologies  that enable establishment of transcriptomic resources for plant species without the need for associated genomic resources  <cit> . next generation sequencing technologies allow comprehensive transcriptome sequencing  that produces both qualitative data  and quantitative data  with an unprecedented level of sensitivity and accuracy . accordingly, rna-seq is considered a highly promising way of unravelling the genetic control of complex traits in weeds  <cit> . yet, despite the acknowledgement of the potential of transcriptome-wide sequencing to study weed response to herbicides and ntsr  <cit> , only a few studies have implemented this approach to date .

alopecurus myosuroides l.  is a diploid grass  weed with no associated genomic or transcriptomic resources. a. myosuroides is a major weed of winter crops in north-western europe that can be responsible for substantial yield losses  <cit> . a. myosuroides has evolved resistance to six herbicide modes of action  <cit> , including leaf-applied herbicides that are the herbicides most used to control this species. in a. myosuroides, resistance to leaf-applied herbicides is mostly due to polygenic ntsr mechanisms  <cit> . the major group of leaf-applied herbicides used against a. myosuroides are acetolactate synthase  inhibitors. als is a key enzyme in the branched-chain amino acids  biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . physiological effects of als inhibitors on the cellular amino-acid pools, protein turnover and carbohydrate metabolism have been described in crop or model species . to the best of our knowledge, the transcriptomic response of a plant to the stress caused by an als inhibitor had so far only been investigated in a few studies considering model or crop species .

our purpose was to establish the first transcriptome resource for a. myosuroides  using illumina sequence data obtained from a time-course experiment. to check the relevance of alomybase for the identification of genetic determinants of ntsr to als inhibitors, the transcriptomic response of a. myosuroides plants resistant or sensitive to an als inhibitor was investigated. five contigs potentially involved in ntsr to als inhibitors were identified as an additional outcome of this study.

RESULTS
establishing alomybase: a. myosuroides transcriptome sequencing and data assembly
the expected phenotypes of all plants used for rna-seq  were confirmed by rating the corresponding phenotype control clones  <dig> weeks after herbicide application. raw 100-base single-end sequence reads were subjected to quality control using phred scaled quality score. overall,  <dig>  % of the sequenced bases had a quality score ≥  <dig> and  <dig>  % of the sequence reads passed quality filters and matched illumina’s quality requirements. the proportion of undetermined bases was  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in the two flow cells used for sequencing. after filtering out low quality reads, homopolymers and short reads,  <dig> , <dig> 100-base single-end reads were generated from the  <dig> cdna libraries. the number of reads was similar in the different libraries .

de novo assembly of the 100-base reads yielded  <dig>  unique sequences ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  nucleotides in length . the length distribution of the assembled contigs is shown in fig. 1a. the proportion of contigs with at least one mapped read was similar in all experimental modalities, except the resistant pool at  <dig> h after treatment  where only 50 % of the contigs assembled had at least one mapped read . this experimental modality was thus considered dubious, and the whole 48hat time-point was removed from further analyses.table  <dig> alomybase statistics

functional annotation and contig expression data
automated search for coding sequences in all the assembled contigs using framedp identified  <dig>  predicted peptides with an average length of  <dig> amino-acids. peptide size ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amino-acids. overall,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the predicted peptides could be assigned a go term, an interpro domain or a pfam family, respectively . small contigs and predicted peptides of small size that probably corresponded to truncated contigs were poorly annotated . thus, assembled contigs shorter than  <dig> nucleotides or encoding predicted peptides shorter than  <dig> amino-acids were considered as assembly waste and discarded.

rpkm counts were computed in each experimental modality for every contig. contigs with low rpkm values could be assembly artefacts. as proposed before , a contig was considered potentially expressed if it had an average 2-fold sequencing coverage. as the reads used for de novo a. myosuroides transcriptomic data assembly were 100-base long, this corresponded to a rpkm value of  <dig> . accordingly, only contigs with a rpkm count ≥ <dig>  in at least one experimental modality were considered expressed. all the other contigs were discarded. of the  <dig>  assembled contigs with a length ≥ <dig> nucleotides,  <dig>  that had a rpkm value ≥  <dig>  in at least one library were considered potentially from expressed genes and used for subsequent analyses. these contigs had a n <dig> value of  <dig> nucleotides and were predicted to encode  <dig>  peptides with a length >  <dig> amino-acids, of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  % could be assigned a go term and/or an interpro domain, respectively . in the following, the name “alomybase” will refer to the  <dig>  contigs and the corresponding  <dig>  predicted peptides sequences.

the  <dig> go terms in the molecular function and biological process categories most represented in alomybase are shown in fig.  <dig>  terms related to oxidation-reduction process, protein phosphorylation and metabolic process contained the highest number of predicted peptides in the biological process category. “protein binding” and “atp binding” contained the highest number of predicted peptides in the molecular function category .fig.  <dig> alomybase top  <dig> go terms in the categories biological process  and molecular function 



comparison of the predicted peptide contents of alomybase with other grass species
the  <dig>  predicted peptides in alomybase were compared to those encoded in the genomes of all grass  species with a fully sequenced genome, i.e., b. distachyon, h. vulgare, z. mays, o. sativa and s. bicolor that contained  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  predicted peptides, respectively. a total of  <dig>  orthomcl groups were identified among the five species and alomybase. of these,  <dig>   were found in alomybase, while  <dig>   to  <dig>   were found in any of the individual species . overall,  <dig> orthomcl groups  were present both in alomybase and in all the five grass genomes. the highest number of orthomcl groups exclusively shared by alomybase and one of the grass genomes was observed for h. vulgare and b. distachyon  . a total of  <dig> orthomcl groups were specific to alomybase. based on their interpro annotation, they mostly contained putative cytochromes p <dig> and regulatory proteins.

a total of  <dig> pfam families were identified among the five grass genomes and alomybase. among these,  <dig> were identified in alomybase, while  <dig> to  <dig> were identified in the five grass genomes. considering the number of predicted peptides assigned to each pfam family, the  <dig> pfam families most represented in alomybase had a similar ranking in all grass genomes . three of these families were potentially involved in herbicide response: cytochrome p <dig>  udp-glycosyltransferase and abc transporter. overall, considering the  <dig> pfam families, pearson correlations of the rankings of pfam families were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  between alomybase and b. distachyon, s. bicolor, o. sativa, z. mays or h. vulgare genomes, respectively.

considering pfam families potentially involved in herbicide response and/or in ntsr, alomybase contained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> putative peptides assigned to cytochromes p <dig>  glycosyltransferases, glutathione-s-transferases, abc transporters, peroxidases or esterases, respectively . the number of putative peptides assigned to these pfam families were roughly similar in alomybase and in the five grass genomes, except cytochromes p <dig> or abc transporters that were particularly numerous in alomybase.fig.  <dig> peptides assigned to six pfam families potentially involved in herbicide response and/or in ntsr. the number of peptides in these families is given for alomybase and the five fully sequenced grass genomes. p <dig>  cytochromes p450; gt, glycosyltransferases; gst, glutathione-s-transferases; alomy, alomybase; brcdi, b. distachyon, sorbi, s. bicolor; horvu, h. vulgare; zeamx, z. mays; orysa, o. sativa




the comprehensiveness of alomybase was assessed using cegma. cegma checks the presence in genome or transcriptome assemblies of a set of  <dig> proteins from housekeeping genes considered widely conserved among eukaryotes  <cit> . cegma analysis of alomybase identified  <dig> of the  <dig> eukaryotic core proteins  as “complete”, “complete” being defined as >70 % alignment length with a core protein. as a comparison, cegma analysis of the transcript sets available for each of the five grass genomes identified  <dig> proteins  in b. distachyon,  <dig> proteins  in s. bicolor,  <dig>  in o. sativa,  <dig>  in z. mays and  <dig>  in h. vulgare as complete.

rt-qpcr validation of alomybase expression data
rna-seq-based contig expression data were validated by measuring the expression of  <dig> contigs over the time-course using rt-qpcr. these contigs were randomly selected. two had a stable rna-seq expression pattern and  <dig> had a rna-seq expression pattern varying over time or between phenotypes . the expression level of the  <dig> contigs in the  <dig> individual samples showed substantial variation among experimental modalities and among individual plants within modalities. variation was also observed among plants with the same phenotype in the same experimental modality . despite this variation, the average contig expression levels computed for the three plants in the resistant pool and for the three plants in the sensitive pool at each time-point matched the corresponding rna-seq expression data  .

transcriptomic response to the herbicide application
the untreated , 6hat, 12hat, 24hat, 36hat and 48hat time-points originated from the same time-course experiment. the 73hat time-point originated from a different time course experiment. at 73hat,  <dig>  contigs were up-regulated compared to ut and  <dig>  contigs were down-regulated compared to ut . these numbers were not different from those at the five other time-points after herbicide application . furthermore, the rpkm values computed for the three reference genes used for rt-qpcr data normalization at 73hat in the resistant pool and in the sensitive pool were not different from those in the other  <dig> experimental modalities . including the 73hat time-point in the subsequent analyses was thus deemed relevant.fig.  <dig> number of contigs regulated by herbicide application. venn diagrams show the number of contigs up-regulated  or down-regulated  in the resistant pool , in the sensitive pool  or in both phenotypes after herbicide treatment. each herbicide-treated modality was compared to the ut of the corresponding phenotype. xhat, x hours after herbicide application



a total of  <dig>  contigs  were up- or down-regulated in the resistant and/or in the sensitive pool in at least one herbicide-treated modality compared to the respective ut modalities. among these,  <dig>  contigs were up-regulated and  <dig>  contigs were down-regulated in the resistant and/or in the sensitive pool in at least one herbicide-treated modality compared to the respective ut experimental modalities.

investigating the transferability of arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional markers for the response to als inhibitors to a. myosuroides
a previous study investigating arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome-wide response to four herbicides inhibiting als identified a set of  <dig> genes which expression pattern was linked to the response to these herbicides in a. thaliana and brassica napus  <cit> . in both species, a subset of  <dig> genes had a similar regulation pattern in response to four als inhibitors , while the regulation pattern of the remaining  <dig> genes varied with the herbicide   <cit> . to investigate whether this transcriptional signature was conserved in a. myosuroides, identification of putative homologues to the  <dig> a. thaliana genes in alomybase was conducted using blastp. for each a. thaliana gene, the predicted peptide in alomybase with the best blastp hit  was retained and considered the most likely homolog. only predicted peptides with a significant homology  were considered . two a. thaliana genes  shared the highest homology with the same predicted peptide in alomybase, and seven had no significant homolog in alomybase. thus,  <dig> alomybase contigs were identified that encoded predicted peptides with a significant homology to one of the  <dig> “group 1” or “group 2” a. thaliana genes. expression ratios were calculated for the corresponding alomybase contigs for the sensitive pool and for the resistant pool at each time-point in the time-course experiment as described  <cit>  and compared to those obtained for the a. thaliana genes.

the regulation patterns of the  <dig> alomybase homologs of the a. thaliana genes was highly similar in both the sensitive and the resistant a. myosuroides pools over the whole time-course . the similarity in the regulation patterns of the  <dig> alomybase contigs and of their a. thaliana counterparts increased with the time elapsed since herbicide application and was highest at 73hat. at this time-point,  <dig> alomybase homologs of a. thaliana group  <dig> markers showed a similar regulation in response to the herbicide application in the sensitive and in the resistant pool . twenty-four of these contigs were up-regulated in both pools. they belonged to the  <dig> alomybase homologs of the  <dig> a. thaliana “group  <dig> marker” genes up-regulated after herbicide application. the remaining five contigs were down-regulated in both pools. they belonged to the  <dig> alomybase homologs of one of the  <dig> a. thaliana “group  <dig> marker” genes down-regulated after herbicide application. three additional alomybase homologs of one of the  <dig> a. thaliana “group  <dig> marker” genes down-regulated after herbicide application also showed a trends in down-regulation in both pools. among the  <dig> alomybase homologs of the  <dig> a. thaliana “group  <dig> marker” genes,  <dig> had a similar regulation pattern in the sensitive and in the resistant pool at 73hat. overall, the regulation pattern of these contigs was most similar to the regulation pattern observed for a. thaliana “group  <dig> marker” genes in response to the als inhibitor sulfometuron .

transcriptional response to the als inhibitors iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron common to both phenotypes 
respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs were up-regulated or down-regulated in both the resistant and the sensitive pool in at least one treated modality compared to the respective ut modalities . the number of contigs regulated in both pools after herbicide application is shown in fig.  <dig>  overall,  <dig> contigs were up-regulated in all treated modalities in both pools, of which  <dig> could be assigned an interpro domain annotation . they included four putative cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases, two abc transporters, four glutathione-s-transferases, one peroxidase and  <dig> udp-glycosyltransferases. nine contigs were down-regulated in all treated modalities in both pools, of which one could be assigned an interpro domain annotation .

among the  <dig> go biological processes significantly enriched  in up-regulated contigs in both pools ,  <dig> were enriched in several treated modalities. “multidrug transport” that was mostly enriched in contigs predicted to encode multi antimicrobial extrusion proteins  and “branched chain family amino acid biosynthesis” were significantly enriched from 24hat on. the other enriched go terms were mostly involved in gene expression regulation, stress response, respiration or amino-acid biosynthesis.

among the  <dig> go biological processes significantly enriched  in down-regulated contigs in both pools , five were enriched in several treated modalities, including “photosynthesis”. go terms linked to stress response  were also enriched in at least one treated modality.

specificities of the transcriptional response of the sensitive pool to the als inhibitors iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron 
respectively  <dig>  and  <dig> contigs were up-regulated or down-regulated only in the sensitive pool in at least one treated modality compared to ut . the number of contigs regulated after herbicide application is shown in fig.  <dig>  among the annotated contigs,  <dig> that had an annotation related to peptide phosphorylation had an expression level higher than in the resistant pool.

among the  <dig> go biological processes significantly enriched  in up-regulated contigs only in the sensitive pool , nine were enriched in several treated modalities. they were involved in gene expression regulation, protein, amino-acid, lipid or carbohydrate metabolism, stress response or cell cycle control. among these, the go term most significantly enriched was “protein amino acid phosphorylation” that included  <dig> contigs predicted to encode kinases. “response to oxidative stress” was also highly significantly enriched in three treated modalities, with the  <dig> up-regulated contigs assigned to this term predicted to encode peroxidases. other go terms linked to stress response or amino-acid-metabolism were also enriched .

among the  <dig> go biological processes significantly enriched  in down-regulated contigs , two were enriched in several treated modalities . go terms associated with biosynthesis pathways , gene expression regulation, photosynthesis or stress response were also significantly enriched.

specificities of the transcriptional response of the resistant pool to the als inhibitors iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron 
respectively  <dig> and  <dig>  contigs were up-regulated or down-regulated only in the resistant pool in at least one treated modality compared to ut . the number of contigs regulated is shown in fig.  <dig>  seventy-four contigs were up-regulated in all treated modalities, of which  <dig> could be assigned an annotation. even after up-regulation, these contigs had a very low expression level .  <dig> contigs were down-regulated in all treated modalities, of which  <dig> could be assigned an annotation. thirty-seven of these contigs had an expression level lower than in the sensitive pool. the most down-regulated contigs were annotated as one cytochrome p <dig>  one inosine/uridine-preferring nucleoside hydrolase and one ribonuclease.

among the  <dig> go biological processes significantly enriched  in up-regulated contigs in at least one treated modality , three were enriched in several treated modalities . overall, the enriched go biological processes were involved in gene expression regulation, atp metabolism, photosynthesis and lipid metabolism .

among the  <dig> go biological processes significantly enriched  in down-regulated contigs in at least one treated modality , four were enriched in several treated modalities  . go terms linked to stress response were significantly enriched in one treated modality.

contigs showing differences in expression between phenotypes 
a total of  <dig>  contigs were differentially regulated between the resistant pool and the sensitive pool in at least one experimental modality . seeking constitutive differences in contig expression between phenotypes identified  <dig> contigs up-regulated in all modalities in the sensitive pool , of which  <dig> could be assigned an annotation. they included six cytochromes p <dig>  one glutathione-s-transferase and one peptidase/thiolesterase. ten go biological processes mostly involved in stress response and post-translational protein modification were significant enriched in up-regulated contigs in the sensitive pool .table  <dig> go biological processes significantly enriched in contigs up-regulated in the resistant pool compared to the sensitive pool and in the sensitive pool compared to the resistant pool

conversely,  <dig> contigs were up-regulated in all modalities in the resistant pool, of which  <dig> could be assigned an annotation. they included two cytochromes p <dig>  five go biological processes were significantly enriched in up-regulated contigs in the resistant pool . contigs assigned to these biological processes were predicted to encode two rna-directed dna polymerases, three reverse transcriptases, three disease resistance proteins, one tubulin, one expansin and one haem peroxidase.

identification of candidate ntsr contigs
a commercial herbicide containing iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron was used in our experiments because commercial formulations, and not solely the herbicide molecule, exert the pressure selecting for resistance in weed populations. to avoid possible confusing effects due to the formulation, candidate ntsr contigs were selected on the basis of an up-regulation ≥ 2-fold in the resistant pool compared to the sensitive pool at each time-point including ut. affiliation of candidate contigs to one gene family presumably involved in ntsr was an additional selection criterion. eleven candidate ntsr contigs were identified. five were annotated as cytochromes p <dig>  three as glycosyltransferases, one as a peroxidase, one as a helix-loop-helix dna-binding  and one as a disease resistance protein. the expression level of the  <dig> contigs was measured in all  <dig> individual rna samples used to generate the  <dig> pooled samples subjected to rna-seq . variation in contig expression that could be substantial was observed between phenotypes, among modalities, and also within modalities . despite this variation, all  <dig> contigs were up-regulated in the resistant pool compared to the sensitive pool at each time-course point, in agreement with alomybase expression data .

the expression levels of the  <dig> candidate contigs was measured using rt-qpcr in  <dig> additional, untreated f <dig> plants:  <dig> were resistant and  <dig> sensitive to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron. five of the  <dig> contigs displayed a significantly higher expression level in the resistant plants . they putatively encoded cytochromes p <dig> from families 71a, 71b or 81d , one peroxidase  and one disease resistance protein . there was a 4919-,  <dig> -, 122-, 1008- and  <dig> -fold difference in expression between the highest and lowest relative expression levels observed for cyp71a, cyp71b <dig>  cyp81d, perox <dig> and dp <dig>  respectively . this was due to the expression of each of the five contigs being almost undetectable in a few plants, and very high in a few others. for all these plants, both biological replicates showed the same extreme expression level and an expression level of the reference genes similar to those of the other plants analysed. no plant displayed an extreme expression level for more than one contig.fig.  <dig> expression of the  <dig> candidate ntsr contigs in  <dig> resistant or sensitive f <dig> plants. comparison of the relative expression levels  measured by rt-qpcr of the  <dig> contigs in f <dig> plants resistant  or sensitive  to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron. the p-values of the wilcoxon test for pairwise comparison between resistant and sensitive plants are given . cyp, cytochrome p450; perox, peroxidase; gt, glycosyltransferase; helo, helix-loop-helix dna-binding protein; dp, disease resistance protein



although some sensitive plants had expression levels higher than some resistant plants for a given contig, the highest expression levels for each contig were always observed in resistant plants . the  <dig>  three, nine,  <dig> and  <dig> plants most transcribing cyp71a, cyp71b <dig>  cyp81d, perox <dig> or dp <dig>  respectively, were all resistant to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron. principal component analysis implemented using expression data obtained for the five contigs allowed clear separation of most, but not all, resistant f <dig> plants from the sensitive f <dig> plants . separation occurred along axes determined by the expression levels of two groups of contigs: cyp71a, cyp71b <dig>  perox <dig> and dp <dig> for one axis, and cyp81d for the other .fig.  <dig> principal component analysis of candidate contig expression data. expression data was obtained using rt-qpcr for five contigs  in  <dig> a. myosuroides f <dig> plants. red dots, resistant plants; green dots, sensitive plants. “*” indicate the plants used for rna-seq



several ntsr genes or candidate genes had previously been identified in grasses . among them, the glutathione-s-transferase amgstf <dig> plays a significant role in a. myosuroides ntsr to acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase  inhibitors, a group of leaf-applied herbicides distinct from als inhibitors  <cit> . in lolium rigidum, another major grass weed, four contigs annotated as two cytochromes p <dig>  one monooxygenase and one glycosyl-transferases were also proposed to have a link with ntsr to accase inhibitors  <cit> . more recently, four additional lolium sp. contigs annotated as two cytochromes p <dig>  one glycosyl-transferase and one glutathione-s-transferase were proposed to be associated with ntsr to als inhibitors  <cit> . these contigs were different from those linked to ntsr to accase inhibitors in lolium rigidum  <cit> . last, one rice cytochrome p <dig> and one echinochloa phyllopogon cytochrome p <dig> were also recently demonstrated to confer ntsr to als-inhibiting herbicides  <cit> . a blastp search in alomybase identified the most probable alomybase homologs of these genes or contigs . the alomybase homologs identified did not include any of the five candidate contigs identified in our work. overall, rna-seq expression patterns of the six alomybase homologs of genes or contigs associated to ntsr to accase inhibitors  constantly increased with the time after herbicide application in both phenotypes, and their difference in expression between phenotypes was above two-fold in at most one herbicide-treated modality only. this was also true for the homologs of two of the contigs associated to ntsr to als inhibitors in lolium sp. the rna-seq expression levels of the alomybase homologs of the two other contigs associated to ntsr to als inhibitors in lolium sp. was either stable in both phenotypes, or stable in the sensitive phenotype and variable in the resistant phenotype without reaching a two-fold difference in expression between phenotypes . rna-seq expression level of the alomybase homolog of the two genes associated to ntsr to als inhibitors in rice or in e. phyllopogon was highest in the sensitive pool. this contig was up-regulated by herbicide application in the sensitive pool only . alomybase homologs of known ntsr genes or candidate contigs could therefore not be considered as contigs potentially involved in ntsr to als inhibitors in our study.table  <dig> alomybase most probable homologs of published ntsr genes or candidate genes identified in grasses and their rna-seq expression patterns

discussion
alomybase, the first a. myosuroides transcriptomic resource
our main aim was to establish a resource to study transcriptomic patterns in a. myosuroides plants resistant or sensitive to leaf-applied herbicides in the absence of herbicide and at the early stages of response to herbicide, using experimental conditions as similar as possible to realistic field conditions. herbicide damage to plants starts occurring  <dig> to 8 h after herbicide application . to be efficient, ntsr must be implemented before herbicide damage is irreversible, and must be upheld long enough to allow resistant plants to recover  <cit> . accordingly, rna-seq data was obtained from a time course experiment ranging from ut until 73hat. a commercial iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron formulation that is applied in the field was used together with its recommended adjuvant in our experiments, because ntsr is selected for in the field by recurrent applications of not only herbicide molecules, but also associated formulations and adjuvants. last, resistant and sensitive f <dig> plants derived from a pairing between a sensitive plant and a resistant plant from a population where ntsr had evolved under herbicide selective pressure were used as starting plant material because using plants with a similar genetic background was expected to facilitate identification of transcriptomic differences related to ntsr  <cit> .

as there is no genomic resource for a. myosuroides, the illumina technology was selected for sequencing because it is the technology of choice for de novo transcriptome deep sequencing and assembly without a reference genome  <cit> . after discarding assembly waste, alomybase contained  <dig>  contigs potentially from expressed genes that encoded  <dig>  putative peptides . this is to be compared to the  <dig> nucleotide sequences from a. myosuroides that had been deposited in genbank/embl to the 5th of june  <dig>  our work therefore tremendously increased the sequence data available for a. myosuroides.

the contigs in alomybase were assembled for rna-seq data obtained from the aerial part of six f <dig> plants at the vegetative growth stage. thus, alomybase was not expected to be a comprehensive a. myosuroides transcriptomic resource. accordingly, the completeness of alomybase as estimated by cegma analysis was  <dig>  %. considering our starting material and cegma estimates of completeness for the transcript sets associated to the five grass genomes , a. myosuroides transcriptome representation in alomybase was deemed satisfactory for our purpose.

as a. myosuroides genetic variability is high  <cit> , the two parental plants used to generate the f <dig> population were most likely genetically different. thus, nucleotide variation was certainly present among the f <dig> plants used for rna-seq, which likely introduced some redundancy among the assembled contigs: more than one contig in alomybase may represent a same unigene and/or several contigs may represent different segments of the same unigene. the precise size of a. myosuroides genome is unknown. estimations based on dna cell contents give an expected genome size between  <dig> and 4330 mb  <cit> , i.e., a relatively large genome. large genomes have a low proportion of transcribed sequences encoding proteins . from the range of a. myosuroides genome size estimates, alomybase sequence data would represent  <dig>  to  <dig>  % coverage of the a. myosuroides genome. even though redundancy was present in alomybase, this value was deemed acceptable for a transcriptomic resource obtained only from the aerial part of young plants. five grass species currently have a fully sequenced genome: the weed b. distachyon , and the crops o. sativa , s. bicolor , h. vulgare  and z. mays . the genomes of these species contain  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes encoding proteins per mb genome, respectively. depending on a. myosuroides genome size estimate, the  <dig>  peptides predicted to be encoded by the potentially active contigs in alomybase corresponded to seven to  <dig> potential genes encoding proteins per mb genome. even considering partial transcriptome coverage and occurrence of redundancy, this is in the range of values observed for the grass species with genome sizes similar to that of a. myosuroides .

the n <dig> size value of the contigs in alomybase was  <dig> nucleotides , a value higher than those obtained for other recent plant de novo transcriptome assemblies based on illumina sequence reads  <cit>  or on a combination of illumina and  <dig> pyrosequencing reads  <cit> , and similar to that obtained with  <dig> sequence reads  <cit> . the average contig size in alomybase  matched the average length of gene coding sequences in grasses .

the predicted peptide content of alomybase was compared to those of the five fully sequenced grass genomes. in total,  <dig>  % of the protein families identified using orthomcl were shared among alomybase and the five grass genomes . the five grass genomes shared  <dig>  % of the protein families identified. these proportions were in agreement with a previous genome-wide study showing that genome peptide contents was largely shared among grass species, including peptide family representation  <cit> . while alomybase only represents a part of the total a. myosuroides transcriptome, these results suggest a good coverage and a correct representation of the protein families of a. myosuroides genome in alomybase. considering the number of shared protein families, alomybase content was closer to those of h. vulgare and b. distachyon genomes . similarly, rank correlation for the number of predicted peptides assigned to pfam families was highest between alomybase and b. distachyon genome. the six grass species considered belong to three major subfamilies in the poaceae: pooideae , panicoideae  and ehrhartoideae   <cit> . thus, similarities in protein family representation are consistent with phylogenetic proximity, as already observed  <cit> .

peptide annotation identified  <dig> alomybase contigs potentially encoding peptides assigned to major families involved in ntsr  <cit> . peptides annotated as cytochrome p <dig> or abc transporters were particularly abundant in alomybase. this could be due to the probable heterozygous status of the plants sequenced. heterozygosity has been reported to cause redundancy during assembling, especially in fast-evolving gene families like cytochromes p <dig>  <cit> . other possibilities would be gene evolution via duplication and divergence, a process particularly frequent for cytochromes p <dig>  <cit> , or occurrence of splice variants, which is expected in plants undergoing a stress because alternative splicing is involved in the regulation of stress response  <cit> . even with redundancy present in alomybase, our data suggests a. myosuroides genome would be rich in genes encoding proteins potentially involved in ntsr, which could be a reason why ntsr is so widespread and frequent in this species  <cit> .

particularities in functions such as stress response generally imply particularities in gene expression regulation  <cit> . a good representation of the transcriptome of the aerial part of a. myosuroides young plants and confirmation of the relevance of rna-seq-based expression data using rt-qpcr make alomybase a reliable resource to investigate the transcriptomic response to herbicides inhibiting als in a. myosuroides using rna-seq data.

a. myosuroides general response to the als-inhibiting herbicides iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron
als inhibitors are among the most broadly and frequently used herbicides. yet, their effects are still not totally elucidated  <cit> . most studies addressing plant response to als inhibitors were performed on broadleaved plants, particularly a. thaliana  <cit>  and pisum sativum . briefly, als inhibition is followed by plant growth arrest and the subsequent slow death of treated plants  <cit> . application of als-inhibiting herbicides causes a rapid induction of specific stress response pathways, including detoxification-related genes  <cit> . the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids  is interrupted, causing a decrease in the cell contents in free amino-acids, including bcaas, and a reduction in protein synthesis  <cit> . this is rapidly followed by an increase in the cellular free amino-acid contents resulting from increased protease-mediated protein degradation and reduced protein synthesis rates . other effects of als inhibitors include carbon metabolism impairment leading to an increase in the leaf cell carbohydrate contents and induction of aerobic fermentation  <cit> . central energy pathways are also modified in response to oxidative damage  <cit> .

using a time-course experiment designed as recommended  <cit>  to sample the transcriptome at different times of the day during the early response of a. myosuroides to als inhibitors allowed analysis of the part of the transcriptomic response to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron common to resistant and sensitive plants . the transcriptional response started at 6hat with an up-regulation of contigs assigned to thiamin biosynthesis process and oxidative stress response. thiamin had been proposed to be involved in several abiotic and biotic stress responses, including protection against oxidative stress . oxidative stress associated to als inhibitor action had been reported to be transient and moderate, and not a cause for plant death  <cit> , which is consistent with the early and transient response observed here in a. myosuroides plants. from 24hat on, there was a strong up-regulation of contigs assigned to protein and bcaas biosynthesis. this is likely a direct consequence of als inhibition. contigs assigned to “multidrug transport” were up-regulated from 24hat on, especially multi antimicrobial extrusion proteins , which is similar to a previous finding of mate-encoding contigs being up-regulated in a. thaliana in response to three als inhibitors  <cit> . contigs assigned to “respiratory gaseous exchange” were also up-regulated. they included seven putative alternative oxidases that are part of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. this may reflect the activation of the alternative respiratory pathway, i.e. aerobic fermentation consecutive to carbohydrate accumulation. this is consistent with previous studies  <cit> . from 36hat on, contigs assigned to processes driving gene regulation were up-regulated, while contigs assigned to photosynthesis were down-regulated. this is consistent with plant growth arrest following als inhibition. at the latest time-point studied , there were few additional changes in the processes enriched in up-regulated contigs. however, there was a drastic increase in the biological processes enriched in down-regulated contigs. in particular, many contigs assigned to various stress response pathways, including oxidative stress response, were down-regulated at 73hat, as were contigs assigned to oxygen transport and carbon fixation. the effects of als inhibitor action on a. myosuroides plants reflected by their transcriptional response were consistent with the literature. they can also be considered to reflect the two first phases of herbicide stress response  <cit> : the initial shock phase when stress-signalling pathways are triggered , and the acclimation phase when plant resources are re-oriented towards the establishment of defences .

similarities in the response to als inhibitors were observed between a. myosuroides and a. thaliana. the expression patterns of the  <dig> probable alomybase orthologs of a. thaliana genes used as markers for the signature of the response to als-inhibiting herbicides were established. alomybase orthologs of a. thaliana marker genes in groups 1a and 1b showed expression patterns remarkably similar to those of their a. thaliana orthologs in both the resistant and the sensitive pools . similarities in the expression patterns increased with time, with a maximum similarity observed at 73hat. our data thus support previous findings that grasses and broadleaved plants share common regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> .

from all the foregoing, it is clear that alomybase quantitative and qualitative data are reliable and relevant to study the response to als inhibitors in a. myosuroides. plants resistant to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron because of ntsr reacted to the stress exerted by the herbicide application, with a part of their transcriptomic response being similar to that of sensitive plants and consistent with the effects of als inhibitors described in the literature. this is in contrast to a previous study where, following als inhibitor application, no transcriptomic changes were observed in plants resistant because of a mutant herbicide-resistant als, while their sensitive counterparts showed extensive transcriptomic changes  <cit> . here, a. myosuroides plants resistant because of ntsr were affected by herbicide action in a first step, but ultimately overcame it, as previously proposed  <cit> . as expected, determinants of the mechanisms allowing ntsr plants to withstand herbicide action are clearly to be sought in the part of herbicide response that is specific to the resistant phenotype.

differential response of resistant and sensitive plants to the als-inhibiting herbicides iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron
overall, there were many more up-regulated contigs than down-regulated contigs in the sensitive plants following herbicide application, while the opposite was observed for the resistant plants . this could reflect a random response to the herbicide stress in the sensitive plants, while the response in the resistant plants would be more focused and associated with a down-regulation of functions not crucial to overcome als inhibitor action. in the sensitive plants, the induction of oxidative stress response seemed more marked, with a specific up-regulation of contigs assigned to this process that could reflect an herbicide stress stronger than in the resistant plants. in the resistant plants, contigs assigned to energy production were up-regulated from 12hat on, while no significant up-regulation was observed in the sensitive plants. plant acclimation to stress is an active process that requires extra energy  <cit> . this observation may thus correspond to an earlier and stronger onset of the phase of acclimation to the herbicide stress in the resistant plants. general analysis of contigs differentially expressed between the resistant and the sensitive plants did not allow identification of biological processes that could directly explain ntsr.

candidate ntsr contigs
the primary aim of this work was to identify as many as possible of the contigs presents in plants resistant and/or sensitive to als inhibitors before herbicide application and at the early stages of herbicide response, in order to establish a transcriptomic resource as comprehensive as possible to allow subsequent studies of a. myosuroides response and ntsr to als inhibitors. for this purpose, and because performing rna-seq on  <dig> rna samples was not affordable, the  <dig> individual rna samples studied were sequenced as pooled samples. transcriptomic data from each pooled sample reflected the average variation in gene expression induced by biological variation among individuals  and by the environment . the pooled samples used for rna-seq did not contain distinct biological replicates, as is generally recommended to identify contigs differentially expressed among experimental modalities . this experimental design was thus not optimal for the purpose of identifying contigs specifically up-regulated in resistant plants that could be candidate ntsr contigs  <cit> , especially because we observed that variation in gene expression could be substantial among the individual samples constituting each pooled sample . however, a. myosuroides transcriptomic response to als inhibitor action obtained from alomybase expression data was fully consistent with the literature. despite the limitations inherent to our experimental design, this encouraged us to seek potential ntsr determinants using alomybase expression data. contigs with a constitutive up-regulation in the resistant plants that was maintained during the early phases of the transcriptional response to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron were targeted because ntsr is expected to be most effective in avoiding irremediable physiological damage if constitutive, and because contigs that could be used for ntsr detection would be most useful if constitutively differentially expressed in resistant plants .

the five contigs identified herein with a potential link to ntsr were predicted to encode three cytochromes p <dig> , one peroxidase  and one disease resistance protein . cytochromes p <dig> in families cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> had been shown to be directly involved in herbicide degradation in crop or model species  <cit> . in particular, wheat cyp71c <dig> had been shown to catalyse degradation of a range of als inhibitors  <cit> . cyp71a, cyp71b and cyp81d are thus potentially interesting candidate ntsr contigs in a. myosuroides. the possible roles of perox <dig> and dp <dig> in ntsr are unclear. als inhibitors directly cause oxidative stress, but only as a transient side-effect of als inhibition  <cit> . thus, a direct role of perox <dig> in ntsr is dubious. peroxidases are involved in a variety of plant physiological processes, including abiotic stress response  <cit> . perox <dig> would rather be a ntsr marker, i.e., a contig which expression level is correlated with ntsr but that has no direct role in ntsr  <cit> . the same applies to dp <dig>  which potentially encodes a peptide with homologies to a protein involved in response to a biotic stress.

the contigs identified herein differed from ntsr genes or candidate transcripts identified in previous studies. conversely, previously identified ntsr genes or candidate contigs could not be linked to ntsr in the plants studied in our work . in particular, the glutathione-s-transferase amgstf <dig> that had been shown to be a major player in a. myosuroides ntsr to herbicides inhibiting accase  <cit>  was not identified in our work as a potential candidate contig involved in ntsr to als inhibitors. the same applies to the alomybase homologs of other genes or candidate transcripts associated to ntsr to accase inhibitors  <cit>  . however, these genes or contigs were regulated by herbicide application . this suggests that they may be involved in the broad response to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron, but not directly in ntsr to these herbicides. a. myosuroides response pathways to accase inhibitors and to als inhibitors, and thus ntsr to each group of herbicides, may be interrelated, as suggested previously  <cit> . the alomybase homologs of previously identified genes or contigs associated to ntsr to als inhibitors  <cit>  were also not involved in ntsr to als inhibitors in the a. myosuroides plants studied herein, which is fully consistent with ntsr being underlain by a diversity of mechanisms that vary among species, populations and individuals  <cit> .

in summary, we identified five contigs that are potential ntsr genes or markers. the expression levels of the five contigs varied among the f <dig> plants analysed: some resistant plants showed a low level of expression for these contigs, and some sensitive plants displayed a high level of expression for some of these contigs. such variation among individual plants in the expression of genes with a link with ntsr had previously been observed  <cit> . principal component analysis suggested two groups of ntsr mechanisms could be present in the f <dig> plants studied, but did not allow separating all resistant plants from all sensitive plants. our data suggested that the resistant f <dig> plants studied were not all resistant because of the same ntsr mechanisms, and that not all contigs with a role in ntsr were identified in our study. as all f <dig> plants studied herein derived from a single parental plant with ntsr to als inhibitors, this suggests the occurrence of a set of genes endowing ntsr in the parental plant with ntsr. this is in accordance with previous data showing that ntsr is under polygenic control in a. myosuroides  <cit> . further investigation is clearly necessary to confirm the link of the five contigs identified with ntsr, and in particular whether the three putative cytochromes p <dig> have a degrading activity against iodosulfuron and mesosulfuron.

CONCLUSIONS
we obtained rna-seq data from the aerial part of young herbicide-resistant and herbicide-sensitive a. myosuroides plants that provided substantial transcriptome coverage. this data was assembled to generate alomybase, the first a. myosuroides transcriptomic resource. alomybase was used to get insight into the transcriptomic variation occurring in plants resistant or sensitive to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron following the application of this herbicide. in both resistant and sensitive a. myosuroides plants, the transcriptomic response to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron mirrored known effects of als inhibitors and were consistent with the literature data. striking similarities with the transcriptomic response of a. thaliana to als inhibitors were observed. specificities in the response to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron were observed in the resistant and in the sensitive a. myosuroides plants, but our experimental design did not allow identification of processes involved in ntsr. our data confirmed that gene regulation is at the root of herbicide response and of ntsr. considering the limitations in our experimental design, contigs potentially involved in constitutive ntsr were tentatively identified. high expression levels of five contigs, of which three potentially encoded cytochromes p <dig>  were correlated with ntsr in the f <dig> population studied. these contigs are potential ntsr candidates that remain to be fully validated. alomybase is thus a transcriptomic resource for a. myosuroides that will be of great use for future research aiming at unravelling the complex, quantitative genetic bases of constitutive and herbicide-induced ntsr to leaf-applied herbicides in this species, understanding its evolution and devising efficient and long-lasting a. myosuroides control strategies.
