BACKGROUND
mouse embryonic stem cells , which are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, are valuable for studying pluripotency. indeed, these cells recapitulate the complete mouse developmental program when injected into fertilized eggs and are widely used to introduce targeted mutations in mice  <cit> . in addition, they can be induced to differentiate in vitro to various cell types of the three germ layers and are therefore of great interest for study signalling pathways leading to specialized cell differentiation  <cit> . knowledge of molecular determinants that regulate stem cell fate and understanding their functions are key challenges for future therapy based on stem cells in which their plasticity has to be properly controlled.

two major pathways have been characterized so far, leading to the identification of "master genes" critical for the maintenance of mouse es cell pluripotency: the lif/stat <dig> pathway, which synergizes with bmp2/ <dig> and/or wnt family members , to maintain es cell pluripotency alone  <cit> , and the oct4/sox <dig> and nanog pathways, the last one identified in cells in which the lif pathway has been knocked-down  <cit> . the many known regulators of es cell pluripotency, like c-yes,  <cit> , c-myc,  <cit> , foxd <dig>  <cit>  and those characterized by gene profiling studies  <cit>  might be classified in one or the other pathway. however, the exhaustive characterisation of transcriptional targets of lif in es cells and in their early differentiated derivatives has not been reported and the specificity of lif targets versus those of oct <dig> or nanog has not yet been investigated  <cit> .

lif is a member of the interleukin- <dig>  family of cytokines, which displays pleiotropic functions, depending on both cell maturity and cell type  <cit> . indeed, while lif maintains es cell pluripotency and is a critical cell survival factor in myocytes, embryonic germ cells, particular subtypes of neurons and osteoblasts, it induces differentiation of the m <dig> leukemic myeloid cell line, can switch the identity of neurons  <cit> , induces cell cycle arrest in cancer cells  <cit>  and has a key pro-apoptotic role during the post-gestation process of mammary gland involution  <cit> .

in mouse es cells, lif induces signalling pathways including jak1/stat3/myc/cd9/socs3/pi3k and erk/rsk/creb leading to activation of both anti- and pro-differentiative signals  <cit> . the transcriptional targets of lif are the outcomes of these signalling cascades and their identification is a critical step for understanding the control of es cell pluripotency. also, lif-dependent gene profiling performed in various cell states , should help to define different groups of lif responsive genes, leading to a better understanding of pleiotropic effects of this cytokine.

the aim of this study was to characterize the lif transcriptome of mouse es cells as well as to identify novel regulators of the transition from pluripotent to irreversibly committed cells. by gene profiling studies, performed on es cells cultured under various conditions, we have identified eight independent gene clusters including a novel gene category whose expression level varies transiently in reversibly committed cells only. moreover, our strategy allowed us to identify different sets of lif-regulated genes and to define those ones also regulated by oct <dig> or nanog. the effects of selected genes on es cell differentiation were also investigated.

RESULTS
1) – lif targets in mouse es cells: experimental design
to identify lif targets in pluripotent and committed-derived es cells as well as key genes regulated during the transition from pluripotent to early differentiated cells, we carried out an experimental strategy based on these three facts i) a complete change of cell culture medium  is required every  <dig> h to induce a boost in stat <dig> phosphorylation allowing cells to remain pluripotent, ii)  <dig> h after lif withdrawal, stat <dig> is inactivated by dephosphorylation and if incubated for longer in the absence of lif, es cells will differentiate. however, if lif is added back  <dig> h after its withdrawal, differentiation is prevented and cells maintain their pluripotent state. cells generated following  <dig> h of lif starvation can therefore be categorised as in a state of reversible commitment, iii)  <dig> h following lif withdrawal, while remaining lif-sensitive, cells are irreversibly committed to differentiate. indeed, even if lif is added back, cells differentiate and a proportion of them die by apoptosis  <cit> . the lif-dependent kinetic experiments of stat <dig> activation showed a maximal stimulation at  <dig> min., which corresponds to the maximal level of phospho-tyr <dig> and phospho-ser <dig> stat <dig> protein leading to the formation of active stat3-dna complexes .

gene profiling experiments were carried out with mrna extracted from the cgr <dig> mouse es cell line cultured under growth conditions as defined in figure 1b. cells in pluripotent , reversible  or irreversible  commitment states were treated with serum or serum and lif,  <dig> min. before harvesting. protein lysates were also prepared in parallel with rna samples. analysis of lif-dependent induction of stat <dig>  as detected by the extent of its phosphorylation, confirmed lif responsiveness of pluripotent, reversibly, and irreversibly committed cells. in addition, we observed a progressive decrease in the levels of stat <dig> protein after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of lif starvation, which correlates with the loss of cell pluripotency. in contrast, no changes in oct <dig> protein level was observed at these early times of cell differentiation. as expected, the amount of erk <dig> proteins was unaltered under these various conditions and therefore, it was used as a protein loading control . the quality of mrna hybridized to microarrays was checked by rt-pcr experiments on a control  and known lif-induced genes as socs <dig>  junb and fos and the pluripotent klf <dig> gene,  <cit> , .

2) gene expression profiling in the absence or presence of lif
five independent total rna preparations from each condition, , were processed and hybridized on the mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  array  which includes  <dig> probe sets. after rma normalisation  <cit>  and outlier removal, pairwise comparisons have been performed using the paired student t-test . this allows the classification of genes into  <dig> tables . in addition, multiple testing correction has been performed using the benjamini and hochberg procedure  <cit> , as described in the methods section.

tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the sets of the lif-regulated genes detected in es cells reversibly and irreversibly committed to differentiate following acute treatment with lif. genes whose expression was induced by lif, named hereafter lifind genes, belong to various gene families including the early growth response genes , members of immediate early response , and of kruppel-related gene  families, ras-dex <dig>  ypel <dig> and the pi3k regulator dapp <dig>  in addition, an est of unknown function, 1459961_at, encoded by a gene localized at proximity of the stat <dig> locus  has also been retrieved . a subgroup of genes induced after  <dig> h of lif withdrawal was also induced after a  <dig> h period of lif starvation . in addition, few lif-repressed genes , with the extent of repression less than 2- fold, were retrieved  <dig> h after lif withdrawal , and no repressed genes were identified after  <dig> h of lif starvation. while our stringent criteria of gene selection by the t-test analyses do not lead to the identification of lif-modulated genes in pluripotent cells , we detected a lif-dependent increased expression of some genes, including ypel <dig>  plscr <dig>  dapp <dig>  junb, stat3loc and klf <dig>  in pluripotent cells, by semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis . altogether, these results showed that the lif response was different in pluripotent, reversibly and irreversibly committed cell populations, suggesting that lif outcomes do not rely on the sole activation of stat <dig>  similarily induced in these three conditions.

tables  <dig> and  <dig> depict pair-wise comparisons of genes whose expression was significantly diminished after  <dig> h  or  <dig> h of lif starvation  in comparison to pluripotent cells . in this analysis, lifind genes, as defined in table  <dig>  were also retrieved  indicating that some cell fate-regulated genes could also be reinducible by lif, a property not shared by the majority of genes retrieved in these tables. this analysis allowed to identify the core "pluri" genes including known pluripotent markers such as stat <dig>  nanog, klf <dig>  yes, zfp42/rex <dig>  bcl <dig>  spp <dig>  cd <dig>  esrrb, tbx <dig>  tcl <dig>  <cit>  and members of gene families not yet described to be regulated in the es cell model. we identified genes encoding for proteins involved in cell adhesion , wnt , ras , notch , interleukin <dig>  and tgfb  signalling pathways, in cytoskeleton organization , and in lipid  and superoxide anion metabolism . many transcription factors  and chromatin regulators  were also identified.

tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gather genes whose expression increases upon lif withdrawal. twenty genes, whose expression level was up regulated in irreversibly committed cells versus pluripotent cells, were also expressed in reversibly committed cells . this findings suggest that irreversible commitment maybe linked to the sustained expression of a set of genes expressed at earlier time following lif withdrawal. in table  <dig>  we noted that the majority of genes  has a particular expression profile characterized by low level of expression in pluripotent cells, high level of expression in reversibly committed cells and low level of expression again in irreversibly committed cells . these genes, including bhc <dig>  bicd <dig>  six <dig>  bmi <dig>  aire, jmjd1c, jmjd2c and tle <dig>  define a new category of genes, whose expression is transiently induced in reversibly committed cells . table  <dig> includes genes induced at  <dig> h versus  <dig> h of lif starvation. some of these genes are specific of the irreversibly committed cells.

3) gene clustering of all conditions
we performed an anova  on data obtained under the different cell growth conditions. the expression profiles of highly significant differentially expressed genes  have been categorized using hierarchical clustering. this allowed to group genes with similar expression profiles, an indication of potential co-regulation and common functions  <cit> . tree view representation of the clusters led to the identification of eight independent groups of genes . the upper dendrogram shows the expected clustering of the different cell growth conditions with the pluripotent state in one branch , and the reversibly  and irreversibly  committed conditions in the other branch. the complete list of genes of the cluster analysis is available .

cluster  <dig>  includes genes whose expression, induced at  <dig> h of lif starvation, is sustained at  <dig> h . cluster  <dig>  defined the differentiated markers specific of the irreversibly committed cells, like car <dig>  embigin, fgf <dig>  ptpn <dig>  irx <dig>  fgfr <dig>  rbp <dig>  some of them corresponding to known cell lineage markers such as fgf <dig> 

clusters  <dig>  and  <dig> , are the mirror image from each other and define new atypical gene behaviors. modulation in the expression level of these genes was only detected in the reversibly committed cell population. indeed, the expression profile of these genes is: "high-low-high"  or "low-high-low"  in "pluri – r.com – ir.com" cell growth conditions. among genes from cluster  <dig> we identified vimentin, hspb <dig> and jund <dig>  genes from cluster  <dig> include transcription factors like mlr <dig>  aire, tle <dig> and chromatin regulators as bhc <dig>  smarca <dig>  genes from these clusters might be necessary to regulate the transition from pluripotent to irreversibly committed cells and their identification would not have been possible without the clustering of all data obtained in our experimental conditions.

clusters  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  define genes highly expressed in pluripotent cells and whose expression level, was i) abruptly decreased  <dig> h following lif starvation , ii) progressively decreased,  or iii) decreased only  <dig> h after lif starvation . genes from cluster  <dig> are named "pluri" genes thereafter.

cluster  <dig>  includes genes whose expression was induced by lif in both reversibly or irreversibly committed cells. only one gene  was found repressed by lif in this analysis.

the regulated expression of a selection of genes from each cluster and tables  <dig> and  <dig>  was validated by semi-quantitative rt-pcr .

4) cell fate-independent and cell-specific lifind genes
to determine whether the lifind genes from table  <dig>  are modulated by lif in other cellular context, we analysed their expression profile with the heatmapper tool, under our set of conditions , and in an embryoid body  kinetic analysis following lif withdrawal, from day  <dig> to day  <dig> . indeed, we had previously shown that some lif targets  are expressed, several days after lif withdrawal, in differentiated cells  <cit> . in this study, we extended this analysis and showed that almost all the genes induced by lif in reversibly and irreversibly committed cells, are re-expressed, concomitantly with the re-expression of lif and of its receptors  at day  <dig> of eb differentiation . in contrast, genes marked with an asterisk in figure 5a are not re-expressed . therefore, we have characterized two types of lifind genes: those induced by lif at  <dig>   <dig> h and  <dig> days after lif withdrawal and which correspond to cell fate-independant lif targets  and genes whose induction by lif is cell-restricted  and which were not known, so far, as lif targets.

5) regulation of "pluri" genes in embryoid bodies kinetic following lif withdrawal
genes from cluster  <dig> , were also analysed with the heatmapper tool in the time course of eb differentiation . master genes, oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog, whose expression is stable up to day  <dig>  or day  <dig>  and which are therefore not present in cluster  <dig>  were manually added for this analysis. three groups of genes were identified: i) those strictly expressed in pluripotent cells , including pluripotent cell marker like esrrb; ii) those re-expressed at day  <dig> of the eb diffentiation kinetic , including the lif-dependent cd <dig> gene  <cit> , and iii) genes whose expression was higher in differentiated than in pluripotent cells , including stat <dig>  this analysis helps to identify relevant new genes potentially involved in the maintenance of es cell pluripotency, since known pluripotent markers are present in each of these clusters.

6) analyses of lifind and pluri gene expression in oct <dig> and nanog knock-down experiments
the overall expression level of oct <dig> and nanog was unaltered up to three days upon lif withdrawal in the kinetic of embryoid bodies . however, the recent finding that es cells are heterogeneous for the expression of many markers, like nanog but no oct <dig>  prompted us to determine whether the expression level of genes identified in this study could be directly modulated by these master genes. this should help to find a specificity of these core "pluripotent master genes"  <cit> . we have analysed expression profiles of lifind and pluri genes after knock-down of nanog and oct <dig> by rnai. availability of affymetrix data, from loh et al,  <cit> , performed with mouse es cells infected with lentivirus expressing shnanog or shoct <dig> silencing rnas, allowed such an analysis. heatmapper analyses were performed with lifind  or pluri genes . the expression of lifind genes are either repressed like ier <dig>  socs <dig>  klf <dig> or egr <dig>  or induced like zfp <dig>  fos and rasd <dig>  by oct <dig> knock down. remarkably, ier <dig> is the only lifind gene whose expression is repressed by nanog silencing. in addition, this analysis emphasizes the particularity of some spe-lifind genes  and of junb, sbno <dig> and egr <dig> whose expression is altered neither by oct <dig> nor by nanog silencing.

a similar analysis has also been conducted with the pluri genes , highlighting their differential regulation by oct <dig> or nanog. indeed, we identified  <dig> groups of genes whose expression is down  or up  regulated following oct <dig> but not nanog silencing or down regulated by independent silencing of both genes . the expression of only one gene  was increased by nanog silencing . these analyses define novel gene categories, not similarly regulated by master genes, which might be part of novel sub-networks involved in the regulation of es cell pluripotency.

7) effects of knock-down of a selection of lifind and pluri genes in pluripotent cells
in silico analyses allowed us to select genes among the lifind and pluri genes for further functional studies. we focused our efforts on a selection of spe-lifind genes  and also included ier <dig> owing to its particular expression profile in oct <dig> and nanog silencing experiments. concerning the pluri genes, we performed the experiments with genes specifically expressed in pluripotent cells such as irak <dig>  susd <dig> and ly <dig> and whose expression was affected by only one master gene , except ly <dig>  which behaves as esrrb, a recently identified pluripotent marker  <cit> . we have also included tcfcp2l <dig>  a transcription factor strictly expressed in pluripotent cells .

we have tested the function of these genes using an rna interference strategy. endoribonuclease prepared  sirnas  <cit>  were generated, targeting the different genes. es cells were transfected twice with each esirna and stained with alkaline phosphatase  five days after the first transfection . knock-down of stat <dig> and oct <dig> led to morphological cell differentiation , and proliferative defects similar to that observed when lif was withdrawn for  <dig> to  <dig> days, consistent with their known function in maintaining pluripotency . knock-down of the various genes tested did not induce significant morphological changes, as shown for ier <dig> as well as for the other genes tested . however, alteration in gene expression level  occurred much earlier than morphological changes, which are observed at three days upon lif withdrawal  and as morphological changes, which are observed at three days upon lif withdrawal, as shown in figure 3a and as reported in other es cell lines,  <cit> . this prompted us to analyse the effects of gene silencing on the expression of early differentiation markers. expression level of lef <dig>  pak <dig>  car <dig> and dnmt3a, all induced at  <dig> or  <dig> h of lif withdrawal , was analysed after  <dig> days of transfection in es cells grown with lif. the expression of nestin, gata <dig>  gata <dig> and sox <dig>  induced at later times of lif withdrawal, was also studied. the efficiency of the silencing of each esirna was determined by rt-qpcr and shown to be in the range of  <dig> to 80% . the expression of almost all the differentiation markers tested was modulated by the silencing of stat <dig> or oct <dig>  however, individual silencing of the selection of lifind or pluri genes led to no effects or modest up regulation of some of the tested differentiation markers .

discussion
from pluripotent to irreversibly committed cells: the lif impact
by gene profiling studies performed with pluripotent murine es cells and with reversibly or irreversibly es-derived committed cells, treated or not with lif, we end up with a new global view of the genetic program leading from pluripotent to differentiated cells, as summarized in figure 8: when lif is withdrawn for  <dig> h, cells enter the commitment phase and the expression of  <dig> genes declines , while the expression of  <dig> genes increases . when lif is added back at this stage, twenty genes are induced  and twelve are repressed. this type of treatment allows cells to maintain their pluripotent state, as illustrated by their ability to colonize blastocysts and produce chimera almost as efficiently as cells kept under the continuous presence of lif  <cit> . when lif is withdrawn for  <dig> h, the set of genes repressed, in comparison with the pluripotent cells, is larger than at  <dig> h of lif starvation. some of these genes  are already expressed by reversibly committed cells suggesting that their sustained expression might be critical for the establishment of the differentiated state. among them, otx <dig> was recently shown to be a critical regulator of early cell differentiation  <cit> . lif treatment of cells starved of lif for  <dig> h does not reset the stemness program as shown by their inefficiency to form teratomas or colonize blastocysts  <cit> . our statistical study reveals differences in the set of lif targets induced after a  <dig> h or a  <dig> h period of lif starvation. indeed, only a portion of the genes identified in reversibly committed cells was induced by lif in irreversibly committed cell population. in addition, the extent of lif induction was less than half that observed in reversibly committed cells, despite the fact that stat <dig> phosphorylation and activity remained very high in both situations. this suggests that activated stat <dig> could regulate a cell-state-dependent pathway which locks cells in a differentiated state.

three lif-dependent signatures
our analysis has allowed also to distinguish between spe-lifind , pleio-lifind  and pluri genes. this last category corresponds to lif-dependent genes, not reinducible by lif in the first  <dig> h of differentiation . some of the pleio-lifind genes are known for their impact on stemness, , in trophoblast differentiation  and for their activation in the m <dig> myeloid cell line, in which lif is pro-differentiative . however, none of the spe-lifind genes have previously been identified as lif targets. many of these genes are not well characterized, and their potential responsiveness to lif could help unravelling their function. in addition, the comparison of lif regulated genes identified in our study with those reported in microarray analyses, performed on other cell types or tissue , shows no overlap except stat <dig> . however, both the different timing of lif induction  and cell context,  <cit> , might account for this absence of overlap. our screen reveals also a partial overlap between lif targets identified in this study, and stat <dig> targets, previously reported  <cit>  suggesting that lif and stat <dig> pathways might have various outcomes which are not yet fully identified, and that lif-dependent response might not be under the sole control of stat <dig> 

our screen revealed that there are few lif-repressed genes. this emphasizes the point that lif effects are regulated through the synthesis of repressors . mereover, new lif-induced negative regulators might be critical for maintenance of cell pluripotency. such a candidate could be zfp <dig>  which encodes for a protein involved in mrna stabilization through the are  sequence  <cit> . we found that a proper level of this protein was necessary to ensure survival of pluripotent cells since its overexpression led to cell death . along with the recent finding that zfp <dig> regulates directly the stability of ier <dig> mrna  <cit> , a new lifind gene identified in that study, it is tempting to propose that differential stabilisation of mrnas could have an impact on the survival of pluripotent es cells.

lifind genes regulation by oct <dig> or nanog
we have classified lifind genes into different sub-groups depending on their differential regulation by oct <dig> or nanog . expression of almost none of the spe-lifind genes is modulated by the silencing of these two master genes, emphasizing their belonging to a lif specific pathway  <cit> . however, the individual knock-down of four of these genes  does not lead to morphological changes nor to a significant alteration in the expression of a selection of early differentiation markers. disruption of all four genes together might be required before any effect becomes apparent. alternatively, these genes could be involved in the reversibility of committed cells grown without lif for  <dig> h,  <cit> , a potentiality not tested in the present study.

novel characteristics of pluri genes and differential regulation by oct <dig> or nanog
the pluri genes retrieved in this analysis include genes previously shown to maintain cell pluripotency like yes, cd <dig>  esrrb, tcl <dig> and tbx <dig>  <cit> ) and many novel genes . we show that pluri genes could be endowed with new features, which might be relevant to explain cell fates. indeed, while expression of known master genes  is maintained for  <dig> or  <dig> days following lif withdrawal, expression of almost all the genes identified in our analysis  is decreased on the first day of lif withdrawal like esrrb or pim <dig>  recently identified as new pluripotent genes  <cit> . the direct targets of esrrb and tcfcp2l <dig>  was recently characterized, allowing the identification of novel regulatory complexes and stressing the potential importance of sub-networks to regulate cell pluripotency  <cit> . also, some of these genes are re-expressed  <dig> days after lif withdrawal, therefore becoming lif responsive in these differentiated cells. in addition, the silencing of oct <dig> or nanog decreases the expression of many of these genes together, potentially explaining why the individual knock-down of some of these pluri genes does not affect cell pluripotency.

we have identified genes whose expression depends of oct <dig> only  or of both oct <dig> and nanog  or of none of them. genes whose expression is induced by oct <dig>  or nanog silencing , have also been identified . however, for unknown reasons, these genes were almost not expressed in pluripotent cells used in the study of loh et al.,  <cit>  while highly expressed in the cgr <dig> cells used in our study and could be among genes whose expression fluctuates between various types of es cells, as already described  <cit> .

 <dig> h without lif: a critical window for cell fate choices
in this study, we also demonstrated that upon lif withdrawal, cells go through a transition phase in which the expression of a new set of genes is modulated. hierarchical clustering analysis was of fundamental importance for the characterization of two types of gene clusters, which displayed "high-low-high"  or "low-high-low"  expression levels in the three cell fates analysed "pluripotent, reversibly and irreversibly committed". some of these genes, , from the jumonji family, encoding for specific histone demethylase, have recently been reported as being essential for the maintenance of es cell pluripotency  <cit> . in addition, among genes from cluster  <dig>  transcription factors  and chromatin regulators  might be critical for the regulation of the expression of genes of cluster  <dig>   <cit> . the functional role of these new gene clusters, to drive the transition from pluripotent to irreversible differentiation, will be a future goal.

CONCLUSIONS
our work has provided a novel global view of lif reponses in mes cells and in their early-derived derivatives and allowed the identification of various sets of lif-induced  and pluripotency  genes. we have also characterized sub-networks of genes whose expression is modulated while the master knot  is still expressed, and which are partly under oct <dig> and/or nanog control. furthermore, our study has led to the identification of gene clusters with atypical expression profiles, which desserve to be studied in details for their potential function in es cell physiology. the recent demonstration that mouse es cells are heterogeneous for the expression of different genes, like rex <dig>  <cit> , nanog  <cit>  and many others characterized by in situ hybridization  <cit> , along with the identification of new genes from this study, open new roads for understanding and controlling es cell plasticity.
