BACKGROUND
southern forests dominated by pines contain one third of the entire forest carbon in the contiguous u.s.  <cit> . among the southern pines, loblolly pine is the most common, productive and valuable commercial timber species due to its rapid growth and vast territory, comprising 80 % of the planted forestland and over one half of the standing volume in the southern u.s. the native range of loblolly pine extends south from new jersey to central florida, and west to central texas, occupying  <dig> million acres of forest land  <cit> . since forests capture and store carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, the widely planted loblolly pine in the southern u.s. provides great value in offsetting atmospheric carbon dioxide and mitigating climate changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions  <cit> .

genomic tools and resources that focus on the dissection of complex traits are revolutionizing traditional loblolly pine breeding and assist with the breeding and deployment of genotypes better adapted to climate change and able to sequester greater amount of carbon. two key prerequisites for development and application of genomics-assisted breeding are the characterization of the genetic variation and the collection of genome-wide molecular markers. a high level of genetic polymorphism is expected in loblolly pine due to its life traits, typical for conifer species, such as longevity, wide geographic distribution, large effective population size and high outcrossing rate. this was confirmed in early studies with isozymes  <cit> , dna-based markers , and especially more recently with snp  markers. about  <dig> snp markers have been genotyped in the previous association genetics studies  <cit> , but many more markers are needed for genomic selection .

in the previous loblolly pine association mapping studies, an illumina infinium high-throughput snp genotyping array developed for multiplex genotyping of  <dig> snp markers was used to dissect genetic control of diverse phenotypic traits . these snps were derived originally from amplicon sequencing data based on a relatively small, but range-wide sample of  <dig> loblolly pine megagametophytes and using pcr primers that were designed using unigene contig sequences assembled from expressed sequence tag  sequences. finally, about  <dig> snps from this 7 k snp array were polymorphic or could be genotyped in follow-up studies .

given adequate geographic distribution sampling, the genetic structure underlying loblolly pine populations could also be elucidated using snps. for instance, eckert et al.  <cit>  analyzed snp and simple sequence repeat  markers among  <dig> rangewide loblolly pine trees and found that the population structure reflected mainly the mississippi river discontinuity.

efficiency of marker-assisted breeding and genomic selection depends largely on genome wide linkage disequilibrium . brown et al.  <cit>  found substantial historic recombination between snps in the sampled alleles sequenced in  <dig> genes and demonstrated that ld significantly declined within  <dig> kb in loblolly pine. a genome wide study by chhatre et al.  <cit>  confirmed rapid ld decay in loblolly pine. these studies suggested that a very large number of markers would be required to link phenotypes to genotypes in association mapping studies and in genomic selection of this species. therefore, for a species such as loblolly pine with a large genome and rapid ld decay, even thousands of markers cannot meet the requirement of identifying all important functional genomic regions. fortunately, genotyping by sequencing , which enables simultaneous marker discovery and genotyping, has facilitated the generation of large numbers of molecular markers  <cit> . nevertheless, the large size and complex structure of the loblolly pine genome pose challenges for the whole genome resequencing. the loblolly pine genome assembly v.  <dig>  spans  <dig>  gbp and contains  <dig>  million scaffolds  <cit> . tentatively,  <dig>  putative genes with an average length of  <dig>  kbp have been annotated in the current loblolly pine genome assembly  <cit> . moreover, various highly repetitive dna elements compose up to 82 % of the loblolly pine genome, among which retrotransposons dominate and comprise 62 % of the genome  <cit> . therefore, reduction of genome complexity is highly desired for application of gbs to loblolly pine.

in our study, we used the entire exome region for target enrichment to limit gbs to mostly coding regions, which represent only ~40– <dig> mbp of sequence space or less than  <dig>  % of the entire loblolly pine genome. in the previous studies, technologies for solution-based enrichment of target regions of interest have been developed for loblolly pine . capture size has been significantly expanded due to the improvement in probe design and capture efficiency, making it possible to capture up to  <dig> mbp of target sequence with a single design . these developments made it possible for us to target and enrich the entire loblolly pine exome, thus greatly enlarging the available number of molecular polymorphisms in loblolly pine.

in this study, we describe the probe design and efficiency of the loblolly pine exome capture using the nimblegen seqcap ez method in a population sample containing  <dig> clonally-propagated trees from an association mapping population generated for the allele discovery of economic pine traits ii  project  <cit> . counties of origin are known for  <dig> out of  <dig> maternal trees . snps were identified by aligning the exome capture sequences to loblolly pine genome assembly v.  <dig>   <cit> . the inferred snp genotypes were then applied to study ld decay and population structure.fig.  <dig> the counties of origin of the maternal trees colored by states. this map shows the sampling sites of the  <dig> out of  <dig> maternal parents of the adept <dig> population used in this study



RESULTS
exome target enrichment hybridization probe design and assessment
sequence capture oligonucleotide probes were designed using  <dig>  exons in  <dig>   high quality tentative genes listed in gene annotation v.  <dig>  for loblolly pine genome assembly v.  <dig>   <cit> . the final probe set used in this study is available from roche nimblegen as custom seqcap ez design “140422_ptaeda_exome_ml_ez_hx3”. approximately  <dig>  million single strand oligonucleotide probes were designed and produced in total that covered  <dig>  %  of the target regions. the regions not covered  were areas where the probe selection algorithm could not find a valid probe. these gaps usually represented repetitive dna regions that, if included, could be expected to cause problems by capturing other homologous regions in the genome and, therefore, decrease capture and mapping efficiency.

in the first published study of exome capture in loblolly pine,  <dig>  probes representing  <dig>  mbp of target exome were designed using  <dig>  unique transcripts derived from the assembly of ests  <cit> . however, the unavailability of a reference genome and, therefore, lack of information on the exon-intron boundaries, negatively affected the probe design. this caused insufficient capture and cross-hybridization and decreased the capture efficiency. this problem was mitigated in our exome capture study, because the probe set covered almost the entire exome and its design took into account the exon-intron structure. the designed probe set covered ~ <dig> mbp of target exome and included previously uninvestigated genomic regions. the risk of capturing pseudogenes was decreased by using only genes classified as “high quality” to design the probes. a key concern during the probe design was the exclusion of those probes that might cross-hybridize with non-target regions and repetitive elements, especially considering that 82 % of the loblolly pine genome consists of the highly repetitive sequences  <cit> . in this study, the preliminary probes were stringently filtered to exclude possible cross-hybridization with non-target regions and repetitive elements. although the capture size could be potentially expanded, if the filtering criteria had been relaxed, the stringent filter guaranteed the hybridization specificity and prevented cross-hybridization.

exome capture sequence alignment and efficiency
we multiplexed ten individually amplified and uniquely barcoded trees per library for capture hybridization, enrichment, and sequencing. after demultiplexing and filtering, we obtained between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million sequence reads per tree. the reads of each tree were mapped to loblolly pine genome assembly v.  <dig>   <cit> . nearly 99 % of the sequence reads were mapped to the reference genome assembly. in order to improve the snp discovery accuracy, the mapped reads were further filtered and only the uniquely mapped, properly paired  and non-redundant reads were used for downstream analyses. after filtering, 62–75 % of the total reads  were used for snp calling .

capture breadth and depth were investigated to examine capture efficiency and target specificity. for the uniquely mapped, properly paired, and non-redundant reads for each tree, we calculated the number of reads that mapped to the capture target regions using the bedtools software v.  <dig> .0-20-gada04b <dig>  <cit> . on average, 67 % of the reads per tree  mapped to the capture target regions. additional non-target captured sequences included those adjacent to target or homologous regions. between  <dig> and 95 % of the capture target regions were covered by at least one read. the number of covered capture target bases was weakly and positively correlated with an increase in sequencing output .fig.  <dig> relationship between reads and capture target bases. a relationship between reads and numbers of covered capture target bases. the numbers of captured target nucleotide bases are plotted against total number of sequence reads obtained in  <dig> trees from exome capture sequencing. the linear regression coefficient  is  <dig>  . b distribution of on-target coverage ≥ 10x depth across the  <dig> trees. the numbers of capture target bases with a coverage depth of ten or greater sequence reads per target are plotted against the total number of sequence reads. the relationship seemed approximately linear within a limited range of the total number of reads at 37– <dig> million. c distribution of mean coverage depth across the  <dig> trees. the mean coverage depth is plotted against the total number of sequence reads. the linear regression coefficients  was significant  and equalled  <dig> 



coverage depth among the  <dig> trees was generally uniform and it was consistent across target regions. among all the trees, at least 83 % of the capture target bases had coverage of 5x, 72 % - 10x, and 49 % - 20x . the number of target bases with coverage depth of 10x or greater  seemed to change approximately linearly within a limited range of the total number of reads at about 37– <dig> million. below this range, the number of captured bases increased faster than within the range. but the effect of increasing became weaker above  <dig> million. the mean coverage depth  increased linearly as the total sequencing output increased , although the variance seemed slightly increased for the lower numbers of the total number of reads.fig.  <dig> cumulative distribution of coverage depth of captured target bases in  <dig> trees. each line represents a single tree



multiplexing individually and uniquely indexed samples before capturing and sequencing greatly saves time and money and has become a standard procedure in sequence capture experiments. however, sufficient sequencing depth  is still needed to guarantee a higher coverage depth on the target regions. fig. 2b and c demonstrate that the coverage depth is positively correlated with the sequencing output. therefore, multiplexing should be reasonable and should ensure sufficient on-target coverage depth to avoid problems associated with low snp detection power. in our study, an uneven number of sequencing reads across different individual tree samples could be mainly due to multiplexing of unequal amounts of the sample libraries.

some of the reads could not be mapped to the reference genome, likely due to either incomplete assembly of the reference genome or multiple sequencing errors in the reads that exceeded the mismatch tolerance threshold of the mapping parameters. although the probes were filtered for cross-hybridization prior to the actual hybridization step, further filtering of the multi- and improperly mapped reads was important in order to retain only the high quality mapped reads for downstream analyses. similarly, the redundant reads were also filtered to remove the potential pcr duplicates and to correct the coverage depth.

the read mapping results demonstrated a high level of on-target efficiency in this research. this guarantees the target regions have enough coverage depth. less than 9 % of the target regions had no matching reads. the main reason for this was that the probes covering these regions were filtered out to avoid cross-hybridization. it should also be noted that the current reference genome assembly is still under development and the target regions with no matching reads could potentially be artifacts or mis-assembled parts of the reference genome.

single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery
snps were detected in  <dig> individual trees using the samtools software v.  <dig>   <cit> . the raw snps were filtered using the selection criteria of being bi-allelic sites with at least 10x sequencing depth in at least 90 % of the individuals, and with the minor allele frequency  ≥ <dig> . a total of  <dig>  snps were acquired for downstream analyses. these snps were located in  <dig>  scaffolds of the loblolly pine reference genome assembly v.  <dig> . a maximum of  <dig> snps were detected in one scaffold. based on annotation of genomic regions, most of the identified snps resided in exons, but some resided in introns or unclassified regions. among all the snps, 58 % were located in exons with an average snp density of  <dig>  snps/kbp ; 53 % were located in coding regions ; 2 % in five prime untranslated regions ; 3 % in three prime untranslated regions  and 13 % in introns. by position relative to capture target region, 51 % of all snps were located in capture target regions with an average snp density of  <dig>  snps/kbp , and 49 % were located in off-target regions . the number of snps detected in exons was more than in on-target regions because the capture extended to the adjacent area of each target.table  <dig> number and percent of  <dig>  snps located in different genomic regions



one of the most important goals of exome sequencing is to identify the genetic variants that can be used in the association mapping analysis to dissect the phenotypes of interest. such analyses require high quality snps, and therefore we focused only on those snps, both within and outside of exons, that passed the strict filtering criteria described above.

population genetics metrics
snps with a maf less than  <dig>  were excluded, therefore snp allele frequencies ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  with a median of  <dig>  . the average transition to transversion ratio  was  <dig>  over all regions . this value was higher in cds than in utrs. the transition bias could be attributed to natural selection on the nonsynonymous transversion, and the even higher ratio for cds could be caused by the increased presence of methylated cytosine in cpg dinucleotides where the methylated cytosine can easily undergo deamination and transition to a thymine  <cit> .table  <dig> transition to transversion ratios  for  <dig>  snps categorized in different genomic regions



heterozygosity and fis were estimated on an individual basis . the results indicated a low inbreeding rate and a high level of genetic diversity. among all individuals, the fis values were generally below zero, ranging between − <dig>  and − <dig> , except in tree 634a, where it was  <dig> . heterozygosity was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  except in 634a, where it was  <dig> . these values were expected because loblolly pine is a highly outcrossing and polymorphic species. in addition, the adept <dig> population was established for association mapping with presumably unrelated trees originally sampled from across a wide part of the natural range. tree 634a may be a progeny from selfing or a mating between closely related trees.fig.  <dig>

after bonferroni correction ,  <dig>   out of  <dig>  snps significantly departed from hardy-weinberg equilibrium . nucleotide diversity  in different genomic regions was estimated in a sliding window of 50 bp with a step of 25 bp . regions out of annotated genes had higher average nucleotide diversity than in annotated genes. this could be due to selection constraints. however, it should be noted that the highly diverged sequences could not map to the reference genome, hence biasing the diversity estimates.

genome-wide linkage disequilibrium 
ld is a non-random association of alleles at different loci and may indicate the genetic forces that structure the genome  <cit> . investigations of genetic diversity and ld are prerequisites for association mapping and help in interpretation of results. we calculated the zygotic ld  values for all snp pairs within each scaffold in the genome assembly and plotted them against the physical distances between the same snp pairs in the scaffold . the average ld for linked snps was inferred from the trendlines of the nonlinear regressions and started from  <dig> , then decayed by half  at 55 bp, to  <dig>  at 192 bp, and to  <dig>  at 451 bp. the proportion of snp pairs located within the same scaffold with r2 >  <dig>  was 18 % in this population, and with r2 >  <dig>  it was 3 %.fig.  <dig> linkage disequilibrium decay plot for  <dig> trees based on  <dig>  snp markers. pairwise linkage disequilibrium coefficients  calculated for all  <dig> trees were plotted against the physical distances  between all pairs of snps within the same scaffolds  and between pairs of snps within the same scaffolds located within 4000 bp . the trendlines of the nonlinear regressions  against physical distance between the snps are indicated in red




highly outcrossing conifers are expected to have a rapid ld decay. neale and savolainen  <cit>  reported that the r <dig> decayed to less than  <dig>  within ~1500 bp based on  <dig> candidate genes in loblolly pine. in spruces, ld displayed diverse patterns among different genes or the same genes in different species, declining rapidly to half between a few base pairs and 2000 bp  <cit> . in douglas-fir , ld decayed > 50 % over relatively short segments from r2 =  <dig>  to  <dig>  within 2000 bp based on sequencing  <dig> genes  <cit> . ld estimates in this study based on the exome-derived sequences indicated an even faster decay than previously reported. this could be due to the much larger number of gene regions analyzed in this study. the discrepancies can be partly explained also by different methods used for estimating ld. the abovementioned studies calculated gametic ld statistics r <dig> using megagametophyte haplotypes, while in this study, zygotic ld between genotypes was calculated. however, gametic ld can also be calculated in our study based on the inferred  haplotypes. when we used the phased haplotypes inferred by the software beagle v.  <dig>   <cit>  for the  <dig>  snps to calculate gametic ld, a slower decay was observed, with ld decaying by half  at 79 bp and to r2 =  <dig>  at 280 bp. the rate of ld decay can vary between genes and across different genome regions  <cit> . therefore the generality of ld distribution across the entire loblolly pine genome remains to be further analyzed because only a relatively small and highly specific part of the entire genome was studied here. our study relied also on the accuracy of contig and scaffold assembly in the draft reference genome that should be verified and ordered in the future studies.

population structure
evaluation of population structure is crucial for association mapping. if not accounted for, population structure may cause spurious associations between markers and phenotypes  <cit> . the adept <dig> population trees included in this study were the clonally-propagated, open-pollinated progeny of the originally sampled trees. the maternal origins were known for  <dig> out of  <dig> trees. the  <dig> trees can be divided into two sub-samples based on the geographic location of their maternal parents: 1) the sub-sample west of the mississippi river represented by  <dig> trees from four states, and 2) the sub-sample east of the mississippi river represented by  <dig> trees from eight states. fst was estimated on a per-site basis following weir and cockerham  <cit> . the fst range was between - <dig>  and  <dig> , with a median of  <dig>  . the mean fst was  <dig> , and the weighted fst was  <dig> . generally, the genetic differentiation between these two sub-samples was relatively low, but statistically significant.

we then applied the software faststructure  <cit>  to infer the admixture proportion using our genotyping data. we thinned the marker set to no more than a single marker within  <dig> mbp on each scaffold, which resulted in a presumably unlinked set of  <dig>  snps. after testing a number of potential subpopulations  with faststructure, ranging from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig> , we ran the recommended faststructure algorithm for multiple k to choose the appropriate number of model components that explained structure in the dataset. the output showed model complexity that maximized marginal likelihood when k =  <dig>  and the model components used to explain structure in data when k =  <dig>  therefore, we considered two and seven clusters as the most likely subpopulation clustering explaining the relationship between admixture proportion and geographical sites.

a clear geographical trend could be observed when the admixture proportions of each tree across clusters were plotted on a map . the segment in each pie chart corresponds to the summarized population assignment inferred by the software. we further aligned the admixture proportion of each tree with the longitude from west to east . strong statistical correlations were observed between longitude and admixture proportion . in fig. 6c and d, vertical lines arranged from left to right correspond to the individual trees according to their original maternal parents’ geographic locations from west  to east  in the southeastern u.s. each vertical line represents admixture proportions for an individual tree partitioned when k =  <dig>  or k =  <dig> . the left  <dig> trees on the x-axis represent the trees west of the mississippi river, while the other trees are from east of the mississippi river.fig.  <dig> summarized admixture proportion distributions for k =  <dig> and k =  <dig>  a & b summarized admixture proportions plotted on the map. each pie chart is partitioned via summarized population assignments inferred by faststructure. c & d individual tree admixture proportion distributions. the trees are aligned on the x-axis according to the longitude from west to east



it has been widely recognized that the glacial advance and retreat have altered the landscape of the mississippi valley and the species became restricted into glacial refugia, thus high dissimilarity was formed between refugia populations  <cit> . a postglacial barrier to dispersal was created between populations located west and east of the mississippi river and thus decreased the gene exchange and increased the overall genetic variance in some species  <cit> . the discontinuity is also evident in loblolly pine, as can be concluded from genetic differentiation estimated in our study based on adept <dig> population, and in the earlier studies that were based on limited numbers of snp and ssr markers  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated the efficiency of exome capture for genome-wide genotyping of a species with a large, complex genome. we took advantage of target sequence capture technology as well as the recently released draft loblolly pine reference genome assembly and annotation to design the exon specific probes across a  <dig> mbp target region. the capture efficiency and specificity were high, paving the way for reliable snp calling. in total,  <dig>  snps were detected from exon associated sequences in an association mapping population adept <dig> that included clones of  <dig> loblolly pine trees originally sampled across a wide range. this population is highly heterozygous and consists of two distinct subpopulations , west and east of mississippi river, respectively. ld decayed faster than previously reported suggesting that a great amount of snps will be required for association mapping. the highly diverse genetic variation reported in this study provides a valuable resource for loblolly pine breeding through marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. further research, including genome wide association studies and functional analyses of candidate genes, is now possible and will contribute molecular tools for selection of loblolly pine genotypes adapted to changing climate scenarios.
