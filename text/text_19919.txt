BACKGROUND
atp-binding cassette  transporters constitute one of the largest protein superfamily and exists in all living organisms . these transporters share highly conserved nucleotide binding domains , which contain walker a, walker b and a signature motif, the c loop, linking the two walker boxes  <cit> . in addition to nbds, a eukaryotic abc transporter typically consists of one or two transmembrane domains , which contain 6– <dig> membrane-spanning α-helices and dictate substrate specificity  <cit> . a classic domain architecture of a full-transporter has a tmd-nbd-tmd-nbd arrangement from the n- to c-terminus, while half-transporters have only one set of nbd-tmd. based on the homology of their nbds, human abc transporters have been categorized into seven subfamilies, abca to abcg  <cit> . abch, which was first discovered in drosophila melanogaster, exists in arthropods and zebrafish but not in mammals, plants and fungi .

most abc transporters encodes membrane-bound proteins that carry a wide range of molecules  across membranes  <cit> . abc transporters use energy released by atp hydrolysis at the nbds to transport molecular cargoes across the membrane. abc transporters also function in cell signaling, ribosome assembly and translation  <cit> . for example, abce and abcf proteins do not function as classic transporters but participate in transcription, translation and ribosome assembly  <cit> . furthermore, plant abc transporters also contribute to osmolality and phytoalexin functions   <cit> .

the advent of genomics era has greatly improved our understanding of the diversity and function of invertebrate abc transporters, including  <dig> in the fruit fly d. melanogaster  <cit> ,  <dig> in the water flea daphnia pulex  <cit> ,  <dig> in the silkworm bombyx mori  <cit> ,  <dig> in the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum  <cit>  and  <dig> in the spider mites tetranychus urticae  <cit> . based on the transcriptome data, epis et al. suggested that abc transporters were involved in the permethrin resistance in a malaria vector, anopheles stephensi  <cit> . similarly, abc transporters were implicated in the degradation of plant secondary metabolites in the cotton bollworm, helicoverpa armigera  <cit> .


the sweetpotato whitefly, bemisia tabaci  , is a phloem-feeding insect pest that cause substantial damages through feeding on over  <dig> host plants as well as by transmitting over  <dig> plant viruses  <cit> . as one of the most invasive pests, b. tabaci is generally considered as a species complex consisting of many biotypes or putative species with different biological and genetic characteristics  <cit> . the two most invasive and destructive b. tabaci biotypes are the q  and b   <cit> . b. tabaci has demonstrated a remarkable ability to develop resistance to insecticides in the field, including organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids and juvenile hormone mimics . insecticide was the driving force facilitating the b. tabaci biotype replacement events in china   <cit> . the overall goal of this research is to understand the involvement of abc transporters, a family of phase iii detoxification enzymes, in the metabolic resistance in b. tabaci. to archive this goal, we 1) provided the first genome-wide analysis of the entire repertoire of abc transporters in the whitefly b. tabaci q; 2) investigated the temporal expression profiles of these abc transporters in different developmental stages; and 3) documented their transcriptomic response to imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide.

RESULTS
identification of abc transporters in b. tabaci
a total of  <dig> abc transporters was identified in b. tabaci q genome . the number of abc transporters in b. tabaci q is comparable with other arthropod species; however, subfamilies g and h expanded in phloem- and blood-sucking arthropods . for example, abcg and abch account for 58%  of abc transporters in the phloem-sucking b. tabaci, and 49%  in the blood-sucking cimex lectularius. the percentage reduces to 21%  in the red flour beetle, t. castaneum. the expansion of abcg and abch subfamilies in these polyphagous and phloem-sucking arthropods, including the whitefly b. tabaci, the wheat aphid d. noxia and the spider mite t. urticae, suggest the potential contribution of abc transporters to their adaptability and invasiveness. phylogenetic analysis categorized the  <dig> b. tabaci abc transporters into eight subfamilies . to further understand the evolutionary placement of b. tabaci abc transporters, in-depth phylogenetic analyses were conducted for each subfamily. the results of these analyses were described and discussed in the following sections.table  <dig> abc transporters identified in the b. tabaci q genome

fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship of  <dig> abc transporters in b. tabaci q. amino acid sequences of nucleotide-binding domains  were aligned using clustalw and subjected to a maximum likelihood analysis by mega <dig>  <cit> . numbers at the branch point of the node represent the value resulting from  <dig> replications. all positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated




abca subfamily
a phylogeny tree of the eight abca proteins identified in b. tabaci and other organisms was presented in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  all of the b. tabaci abca proteins are full-transporters , which is consistent with d. pulex and t. urticae  <cit> . the silkworm abca subfamily, in contrast, contains two full-transporters, one half-transporter and three incomplete abc transporters  <cit> . furthermore, no abca protein has been identified in yeast  <cit> .

the b. tabaci abca subfamily has one of the largest b. tabaci abc transporters, btabq <dig> , encoding  <dig> amino acids . btabq <dig>  clustered with the abca <dig> group, including anopheles gambiae agap010416-pa, d. noxia dnxp_ <dig>  and h. sapiens abca <dig> cluster  . although these abca5-related genes in mammalians  cluster with abca <dig> on the same chromosomes  <cit> , no counterpart of the abca5-related genes has been identified in invertebrates, such as b. mori  <cit>  and t. urticae  <cit> . besides btabq <dig> , the other seven b. tabaci abca genes  form a sister-group with a high bootstrap support. this sister-group clustered with d. noxia dnxp_ <dig>  , t. japonicas tjabca <dig> and seven t. urticae genes. these genes then clustered with d. melanogaster dmcg <dig> with a moderate bootstrap support. dmcg <dig> was down-regulated in the salivary glands of a d. melanogaster e <dig> mutant  <cit> . as an early ecdysone responsive gene, e <dig> was a primary regulator of programmed cell death in d. melanogaster development  <cit> . injection of dsrnas synthesized from the two abca genes, tcabca-9a and tcabc a-9b, led to approximately 30% mortality in the red flour beetle, t. castaneum  <cit> .

abcb subfamily
in b. tabaci q, we identified three abcb half-transporters but no full-transporters . these b. tabaci half-transporters  belong to three clades, indicating that these genes are homologous to abcb genes in human, fruit fly and other insects . btabq <dig>  clustered with abcb <dig> proteins from other species, including d. noxia dnxp_ <dig> , an. gambiae agap <dig>  d. melanogaster dmcg <dig>  t. japonicas tjabcb <dig>  and h. sapiens habcb <dig>  similarly, btabq <dig>  formed an abcb <dig> clade with d. noxia dnxp_ <dig> , d. melanogaster dmcg <dig>  t. japonicas tjabcb <dig>  and h. sapiens habcb <dig>  meanwhile, btabq <dig>  was clustered with abcb <dig> from d. melanogaster , t. urticae , t. japonicas  and h. sapiens .


in h. sapiens, habcb <dig>  habcb <dig> and habcb8/mabc <dig> are mitochondrial transporters with roles in iron metabolism and transportation of fe/s protein precursors  <cit> . drosophila melanogaster dmcg <dig>  was tolerant to cadmium  <cit> . disruption of c. elegans abtm-  <dig>  a homologue of abcb <dig>  induced oxidative stress and premature cell death  <cit> . furthermore, a homologous gene of h. sapiens abcb <dig> in aedes aegypti was up-regulated in an insecticide resistant strain  <cit> . disruption of mouse abcb <dig> decreased mitochondrial iron export and led to cardiomyopathy  <cit> . similar to d. pulex, b. tabaci q do not have homologous genes of human abcb half-transporters that were associated with antigen processing   <cit> .

abcc subfamily
insects typically have different number of abcc transporters . in b. tabaci q, we identified six abcc full-transporters, including btabq <dig> , btabq <dig> , btabq <dig> , btabq <dig> , btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig> . abcc subfamily proteins are full-transporters with diverse functions, such as cell-surface receptor, ion transport and translocation of a broad range of substrates including drugs and endogenous compounds . due to their diverse functions, human abcc subfamily members refer to multidrug resistance associated proteins , which function as transporters; the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator , which forms a chloride channel; and sulfonylurea receptors , which function as regulators of potassium channels  <cit> . in h. sapiens, “long” mrps like abcc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  have a tmd <dig>  the third n-terminal transmembrane-spanning domain, while “short” mrps like abcc <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  lack tmd <dig>  <cit> .

in our phylogenetic analysis, two b. tabaci abcc <dig> genes, btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig> , clustered with d. noxia dnxp_ <dig> , dnxp_ <dig> , d. melanogaster dmcg <dig>  t. japonicus abcc <dig> and a group of h. sapiens “long” mrps  . mrp1/abcc <dig> transports a structurally diverse range of endogenous substances , xenobiotics and their metabolites  <cit> . these mrps have been extensively studied as transporters of natural product drugs such as anthracyclines and plant alkaloids  <cit> . as a homologous gene to h. sapiens mrp <dig>  mrp <dig>  mrp <dig> and mrp <dig>  dmcg <dig> functions as a high capacity atp-dependent organic anion transporter and acts as a transporter of ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone conjugates  <cit> . the other two abcc genes in b. tabaci, btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig> , gathered with a large clade of abcc <dig> in d. noxia, an. gambiae and a cluster of drosophila abcc proteins, including dmcg <dig>  dmcg <dig> and others. mrp4/abcc <dig> can remove a wide range of endogenous and exogenous molecules from cells  <cit> . the abcc transporter encoded by cg <dig> in d. melanogaster was regulated by heavy metals and was involved in biochemical detoxification of zinc and copper  <cit> . drosophila dmcg <dig> gene, a homologue of h. sapiens mrp4/abcc <dig>  was tightly regulated by oxygen  <cit> . the human body louse abcc <dig> gene, phabcc <dig>  was up-regulated after exposed to the pesticide ivermectin. injection of female lice with phabcc <dig> dsrna significantly increased their sensitivity to ivermectin  <cit> .

btabq <dig>  clustered with d. noxia dnxp_ <dig> , t. japonicas tjabcc <dig>  d. melanogaster dmcg <dig>  h. sapien habcc10/mrp <dig> and t. urticae tu03g <dig>  habcc10/mrp <dig> was able to transport amphipathic anions and conferred resistance to some antitumor drugs  <cit> . in addition, btabq <dig>  clustered with sulfonylurea receptors  in d. noxia, d. melanogaster, t. japonicas, t. urticae and h. sapiens. unlike other abcc subfamily genes, surs help form atp-sensitive potassium  channels  <cit> . although sur was considered to be a direct target of chitin synthesis inhibitors  <cit> , it did not express in d. melanogaster epidermis, where chitin disruption was observed  <cit> . moreover, data obtained from d. melanogaster suggested that chitin synthesis was independent of sur  <cit> . similarly, rnai knockdown of sur homologue in t. castaneum did not result in a phenotype  <cit> . abcc subfamily is not only involved in detoxification and multidrug resistance in manduca sexta but also participate in host plant selection in t. urticae  <cit> .

abcd subfamily

bemisia tabaci q has two abcd transporters, btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig>  . the same amount of abcds have also been found in other insects  <cit> , while more abcds were identified in d. pulex, h. sapiens and c. elegans. members of abcd subfamily are half-transporters and involve in the import of fatty acids and acyl-coas into this organelle  <cit> . abcd transporters participated in peroxisome-related developmental progress in c. elegans  <cit> . mutations in habcd1/aldp gene resulted in adrenoleukodystrophy, a genetic disorder that occurs primarily in males  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis suggested that three clades of abcds in metazoans, with the two b. tabaci abcds distributed in two clades . btabq <dig>  clustered with d. noxia, dnxp_ <dig> , an. gambiae agap <dig>  d. melanogaster dmcg <dig>  t. japonicas tjabcd <dig>  h. sapiens habcd <dig> and habcd <dig>  meanwhile, btabq <dig>  belongs to abcd <dig> clade.

abce and abcf subfamilies
abce and abcf subfamilies contain atypical abc transporters characterized by a pair of linked nbds with no tmds  <cit> . their structure implied their roles in biological processes other than transportation. abce <dig> is one of the most evolutionarily conserved proteins and expressed in all organisms except eubacteria. because of its role in translation and ribosome biosynthesis, abce <dig> is essential for all life stages  <cit> . homo sapiens abce1/rnase l was initially identified as an inhibitor of rnase l  <cit> . members of the abce subfamily in human and yeast also have a role in translation initiation  <cit> . however, the abce and abcf transporters have not been well characterized in invertebrates. rnai knockdown of an abce gene, tcabce-3a, resulted in significant mortality in penultimate t. castaneum larvae  <cit> . abce subfamily has only one member in all metazoans studied to date  <cit> , and b. tabaci follows this rule .

for abcf subfamily, three transporters, btabq <dig> , btabq <dig> , and btabq <dig> , were annotated and showed well-supported sister clades . btabq <dig> , btabq <dig> , and btabq <dig>  were placed within the abcf <dig>  abcf <dig>  and abcf <dig> clades, respectively. in human and yeast, abcf proteins participated in gene regulation systems and ribosome assembly  <cit> . mutations in the yeast gcn <dig> gene, which was involved in the initiation and control of translation, reduced eif2α phosphorylation and translation in the ribosome  <cit> . knockdown of tcabcf-2a led to 100% mortality in penultimate t. castaneum larvae  <cit> .

abcg subfamily
abcgs have a typical reverse domain architecture, with a nbd localized at the n-terminus and a tmd at the c-terminus . the abcg transporters in metazoans are half-transporters and can be a functional transporter only after dimerization. in plants and fungi, however, abcgs are full-transporters, also called pleiotropic drug resistance proteins   <cit> . because of their duplicated domain structure, yeast pdrs were not included in the phylogenetic analyses in this study.

abcg proteins represent the largest abc subfamily  in b. tabaci  and also form the largest abc subfamily in d. noxia  <cit> , an. gambiae  <cit> , bed bug   <cit> , human body louse   <cit> , drosophila  <cit>  and a. mellifera  <cit>  . according to sturm et al.  <cit> , the expansion of abcg transporters in d. pulex and d. melanogaster genomes was resulted from extensive lineage specific gene duplications.

among the  <dig> abcg members in b. tabaci q,  <dig> are abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> transporters. these abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> proteins clustered with those in d. noxia, an. gambiae, t. urticae, and d. melanogaster  . the abcg <dig> gene has the same intron/exon structure as abcg <dig>  suggesting that they arose by a relatively recent gene duplication event  <cit> . similar to abcg <dig>  abcg <dig> can be inducible by oxysterols and retinoids  <cit> . in h. sapiens, habcg <dig> and habcg <dig> were involved in cellular cholesterol efflux  <cit> . in addition, the elevated expression of abcg <dig> in an. stephensi suggested its involvement in the degradation of a pyrethroid insecticide  <cit> .

btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig>  clustered with dnxp_ <dig> , dnxp_ <dig> , dmcg <dig>  dmcg <dig>  tu01g <dig>  tjabcg <dig>  habcg <dig> and habcg <dig>  habcg <dig> and habcg <dig> mediated the intestinal and biliary efflux of cholesterol and sterols  <cit> . a clear subclass was formed with btabq <dig> , d. melanogaster dmcg <dig>  and t. urticae tetur17g <dig>  dmcg <dig> , a 20-hydroxyecdysone -induced abc transporter, regulated metamorphosis, probably by removing 20e from cells  <cit> . similarly, abcg expression in silkworm midgut was also regulated by 20e  <cit> . rnai-based functional study confirmed a similar role in metamorphosis of tcabcg-8a, a homologue of e <dig> in t. castaneum  <cit> .

among invertebrates, the functions of abcgs were first characterized in drosophila as pigment precursor transporters   <cit> . in our phylogenetic analysis, four b. tabaci abcg proteins, btabq <dig> , btabq <dig> , btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig> , showed homologous relationships with these pigment precursor transporters in d. noxia, an. gambiae and d. melanogaster. besides transporting pigment precursors, these transporters also function in courtship behavior  <cit> , transport of biogenic amines  <cit>  and up-take of uric acid  <cit> . rnai-mediated suppression and genetic linkage analysis confirmed that down-regulation of pxwhite gene was tightly linked to cry1ac resistance in plutella xylostella  <cit> .

based on a recent review, 80% of the peer-reviewed publications involving arthropod abc transporters  linked abc transporters with insecticides-resistance  <cit> . members of abcg subfamily were over-expressed in thiamethoxam-resistant b. tabaci, suggesting the involvement of these genes in insecticide resistance  <cit> . in addition, abcg subfamily not only participated in multi-pesticide resistance in t. urticae but also reduced the chemical defense from host plants  <cit> . in b. mori, at least five abcg genes acted as 20-hydroxyecdysone -response genes and participated in hormonal regulation  <cit> . these results suggested that members of the abcg subfamily play significant roles in the development and the removal of amphiphilic xenobiotics. although abc transporters in subfamilies b, c, and g are involved in the metabolic resistance to various xenobiotics, b. tabaci q, however, contains predominantly g, but few b and c family members . this bias reflects the importance of abcg subfamily in b. tabaci to fend off xenobiotic offences derived from host plants as well as agroecosystems.

abch subfamily
as inverse half-transporters, abch proteins share the same domain architecture as abcg transporters. abch transporters were first discovered in d. melanogaster and have only annotated in arthropods and zebrafish  <cit> . abch proteins have not been identified in fungi, c. elegans, plants and mammals  <cit> . abch subfamily was documented in zebrafish but not in catfish, fugu or cod  <cit> .

a total of nine abch transporters were identified in b. tabaci. phylogenetic analysis showed that abch subfamily members were species-specific. bemisia tabaci abch clustered with genes in d. noxia with a high bootstrap value . an rnai screen of d. melanogaster genes revealed that silencing of d. melanogaster cg <dig> was lethal  <cit> . in two insecticide-resistant p. xylostella strains, an abch , was the most up-regulated abc transporter  <cit> . knockdown of tcabch-9c, an abch in t. castaneum, resulted in 100% larval mortality and a significant reduction of fecundity and hatching rate. in addition, t. castaneum larvae injected with tcabch-9c dsrna showed a lack of lipids in their epicuticle, indicating that tcabch-9c may be required for the formation of a waterproof barrier in the epicuticle  <cit> . in the cotton bollworm helicoverpa armigera and manduca sexta, the expression of abch subfamily was highly induced after larvae fed with secondary metabolites  <cit> .

expression profiles across developmental stages
based on rna-seq data, all  <dig> abc transporters were expressed with a rpkm  > <dig> in at least one of the b. tabaci life stages . members from abce and abcf subfamilies were ubiquitous and expressed highly throughout b. tabaci developmental stages . in the polyphagous spider mite, t. urticae, an abce , showed high expression level throughout the life cycle  <cit> . moreover, tcabce-3a transcripts were abundant in all developmental stages of t. castaneum  <cit> . the expression profile of abce genes in the intertidal copepod, t. japonicas, and sea lamprey, petromyzon marinus, showed similar trends as well  <cit> . btabq <dig>   had the highest expression level throughout the life cycle. abce <dig>  abcf <dig> and abcf <dig> were highly expressed in all developmental stages of b. tabaci. abcf <dig>  also ubiquitously expressed, exhibited a lower expression level. these gene expression patterns were consistent with the fundamental functions in ribosome biogenesis and translation regulation  <cit> . the results suggest that abce and abcf transporters were possibly essential to maintain “housekeeping” function in b. tabaci.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of abc transporters throughout b. tabaci q life cycle. the codes on the left are the gene id numbers of the  <dig> abc transporters in b. tabaci q. the mrna levels, as represented by log <dig>  values, are shown in the gradient heat map with colors ranging from blue  to yellow . for each stage, values are normalized data from three biological replicates. e, egg; n1- <dig>  1st- and 2nd-instar nymphs; n <dig>  3rd-instar nymph; n <dig>  4th-instar nymph; f, adult female; m, adult male




the expression levels for abca transporters in b. tabaci were relatively low with the exception of btabq <dig>  , which was highly expressed in all life stages . abca <dig> is critical for the proper formation of lamellar bodies and surfactant function and may participate in surfactant phospholipid metabolism  <cit> . btabq <dig>   expressed in all life stages of b. tabaci and highly expressed in eggs and nymphs. btabq <dig>   expressed in all developmental stages, especially in the fourth nymph stage and adult. btabq <dig>   expressed in all stages but at a lower level than other abcb genes. homo sapiens abcb half-transporters, abcb <dig>  abcb <dig>  abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  were localized at mitochondria and functioned in iron metabolism  <cit> .

expression levels of all abcc members were documented in each developmental stage of b. tabaci q, and the expression patterns were different among these genes . only btabq <dig>  was highly expressed throughout life stages . the two b. tabaci abcds, btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig> , showed stable expressional level among different developmental stages . btabq <dig>  was highly expressed while btabq <dig>  showed slight lower expression level. because the two abcds are homologous to those of mammal and insect transporters, similar functions such as roles in fatty acid metabolism can be inferred in b. tabaci q.

members of the abcg subfamily showed different expression patterns in b. tabaci q. btabq <dig> , btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig>  were ubiquitously with high expression profiles. expression levels were also high for btabq <dig> , btabq <dig> , btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig> . overall, abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> members in b. tabaci q had moderate to high expressional levels in all developmental stages. the abcg <dig> in an. stephensi showed an increased expressional level in defense against the pyrethroid insecticide  <cit> . btabq <dig>   and btabq <dig>   showed high expression in all stages of b. tabaci. homologues of abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> in d. melanogaster and t. castaneum function, respectively, in metamorphosis  <cit>  and may have a similar function in b. tabaci. furthermore, btabq <dig>  was annotated as a white gene and its expression level in nymph and adult stages was especially high. recently, a pxwhite gene was shown to be tightly linked to cry1ac resistance in p. xylostella  <cit> .

abch transporters differed in expression patterns during b. tabaci development. btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig>  were highly expressed in all developmental stages. moreover, btabq <dig> , btabq <dig> , and btabq <dig>  also showed high expression level, especially in the 4th-instar nymphs and adults. one abch subfamily gene, cg <dig>  was presumed to be involved in mortality  <cit> . silencing of t. castaneum tcabch-9c reduced oviposition and pupal molting  <cit> . abch transporters are highest expressed in the head of h. armigera when the larvae were ingested secondary metabolism  <cit> .

expansion of abcg and abch subfamilies do exist in b. tabaci q. combined with their expressional profiles, we suspect that these abcg and abch genes are involved in development-related metabolism and in the detoxification of xenobiotics including insecticides and secondary metabolites from host plant.

mrna expression of selected abc transporters by rt-qpcr
the expression profiles of  <dig> selected abc transporters were confirmed by the rt-qpcr . within abca subfamily, btabq <dig>  had the highest expressional level, followed by btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig> . this trend is consistent with rna-seq analysis. similarly, gene expression level of abcb genes from high to low was btabq <dig> , btabq <dig>  and btabq <dig> . expression profiles of abcc, abcd, abce and abcf subfamilies were also consistent with our rna-seq data. in abcg subfamily, the trend persisted. only two genes in abch subfamily, btabq <dig>  and btabaq <dig> , exhibited lower expressional level, which is not consistent with the rna-seq data. statistical analysis by spss demonstrated a significant correlation between transcriptome data and rt-qpcr data .fig.  <dig> mrna expressions of selected b. tabaci q abc transporters by rt-qpcr. the bars represent expression level of b. tabaci q abc transporters relative to the btabq <dig> . data are presented as means ± se. spots indicated log <dig>  values of abc transporters in adults. significant correlation between rt-qpcr and transcriptomic analyses were assessed by spss




transcriptional response to imidacloprid treatments
a total of five genes were significantly up-regulated in imidacloprid-treated b. tabaci . btabq <dig> , an abca <dig> gene, can regulate accumulation of cholesterol  <cit> . the other four belong to abcg subfamily, including btabq <dig>  , btabq <dig>  , btabq <dig>  , and btabq <dig>  .fig.  <dig> transcriptional response of abc transporters in b. tabaci q adults to imidacloprid. the mrna expression levels, i.e., log <dig>  values, are represented in a gradient heat map from low  to high . values were averaged from the three biological replications. the b. tabaci q adults were fed with either water  or imidacloprid at  <dig>   <dig>  and 100 mg/l concentration . an asterisk indicates a significant difference




the metabolic detoxification of xenobiotics likely involves a set of detoxification enzymes, which are general classified into three categories. besides phase i  and phase ii , abc transporters represent a major class of phase iii enzymes.

abc transporters, especially those in the abcg subfamily, facilitated h. armigera defense against secondary metabolites such as nicotine and tomatine  <cit> . the high expression of abcg <dig> in h. armigera was the results of nicotine ingestion  <cit> . in addition, abcg <dig> in an. stephensi was up-regulated in response to pyrethroid insecticide  <cit> . the expression levels of three abc transporters, abcg20- <dig>  abcg23- <dig> and abch-b, were higher in field-collected resistant populations of c. lectularius  <cit> . then knockdown of abcg20- <dig> reduced deltamethrin resistance  <cit> . abc transporters, particularly abcg <dig> and abcg <dig>  may have important role in response to xenobiotics. moreover, abcg <dig> gene has the same intron/exon structure as abcg <dig>  suggesting that they arose by a relatively recent gene duplication event  <cit> . overall, feeding on imidacloprid significantly affected the expression of abc transporters especially those in abcg subfamily, suggesting the potential involvement of these genes in the b. tabaci metabolic resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified  <dig> abc transporters in the sweetpotato whitefly b. tabaci q genome. abc transporter subfamilies g and h are expanded in b. tabaci q genome. the expression profiles of these abc transporters were validated using both rt-qpcr and rna-seq analyses. furthermore, 80% of the significantly up-regulated abc transporters in imidacloprid-challenged b. tabaci were abcgs. these combined results imply the potential contribution of abcgs to the adaptability of this emerging global invasive pest.
