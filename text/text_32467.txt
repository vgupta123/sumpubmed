BACKGROUND
the increase in throughput of next-generation sequencing  machines has enabled the use of whole-genome or targeted sequencing for biological and clinical studies at an unprecedented scale  <cit> . despite the decrease in the price of sequencing itself, the cost and time for preparation of sequencing libraries limit the affordability and feasibility of sequencing large numbers of genomes. various dna sequencing protocols have been developed to increase the throughput and decrease the price per sample preparation  <cit>  . the sample preparation pipeline  that we present here consists of a dna isolation method from yeast cells performed in 96-well plates yielding high-quality genomic dna, a dna fragmentation method performed in pcr tubes with a sonicating water bath, and a heat inactivation step to circumvent the cleanups. depending on individual requirements, individual steps of our workflow can be integrated into other workflows. we applied this pipeline to s. cerevisiae, a model organism of choice for genetic and genomic studies  <cit> . using this pipeline, we sequenced over  <dig> yeast genomes, including  <dig> meiotic segregants from a cross between two distantly related s. cerevisiae strains  <cit> , namely haploid derivatives of s288c  and sk <dig>  the quality of the libraries obtained with this method was comparable to the quality of standard methods with minor constrains that are discussed in the manuscript. the dataset of the yeast segregants was used to determine recombination sites and chromosome copy number variations. with our large set of segregants we were able to study these processes in a quantitative way. our recombination map correlated well with two independent datasets  <cit> , suggesting a conservation of recombination distribution on a chromosome-wide scale among yeast strains. furthermore, we detected chromosome-specific patterns of aneuploidy, which could be explained by structural variations between sister chromosomes and consequences of aneuploidy on fitness.

RESULTS
dna isolation
it is critical to disrupt the cell wall of s. cerevisiae before extracting genomic dna  from the cells. one can use either physical disruption , or enzymes like zymolyase and lyticase  <cit> . since strong vortexing in 96-well plates with phenol and glass beads can disrupt adhesiveness of the plate seals, this approach risks leakage and cross-contamination. hence, we used enzymatic cell wall disruption for gdna isolation. we isolated gdna from up to  <dig> samples per day in 96-well format using a biomek fx liquid handling robot. combining cell pellets from  <dig> ml of overnight culture, the method yielded ~ <dig>  μg of dna . this yield was slightly higher than from protocols that use glass beads  <cit>  and a commercial column based method  in our hands, and was highly cost-effective . for all tested protocols, the dna was of high quality as determined by gel imaging and absorbance ratios . furthermore, the isolated dna contained enough mitochondrial dna to genotype the mitochondrial genome in most of the segregants.

dna fragmentation
fragmentation of dna can be achieved by various methods, including transposon-based adapter insertion  <cit>  and digestion with restriction enzymes  <cit> ; however, physical fragmentation using afa by covaris is generally preferred because of its sharp, homogeneous, and random fragmentation  <cit> . most of the samples in this study were fragmented using the covaris e series, which allows automated processing of  <dig> samples; however, the initial capital and recurring expenses for the microtubes  makes this fragmentation method very expensive. a cheaper alternative is the use of pcr plates in combination with the covaris machine instead of  <dig> microtubes  <cit>  or the use of a bioruptor sonicator   <cit>  allowing for simultaneous sonication of  <dig> individual tubes. here we present another method, using a sonicating water bath  in combination with two 8-pcr strips. we obtained dna fragments that were similar in size range to covaris sonication with sufficient reproducibility . the resultant sequencing reads were homogeneously distributed across the genome, and the gc bias was comparable to samples fragmented by covaris sonication . besides considerable cost reduction, this method has the advantage of working with a smaller volume of  <dig> μl . similar to covaris sonication in 96-well plates  <cit> , we occasionally observed samples that were not fragmented as efficiently as expected; therefore, analyzing the fragment sizes on an agarose gel prior to library preparation is recommended. we optimized the settings for  <dig> μg of dna per sonication, which should be taken into consideration for studies where the dna amount is a limiting factor.

library preparation
most standard library preparation methods perform purification after blunt-ending, a-addition, and ligation steps to avoid carryover of enzymes. many recent high-throughput protocols  <cit>  have replaced column-based purifications and gel size selection steps with magnetic spri bead cleanups  <cit> . the reuse of the beads  <cit>  and the use of a homemade bead mix  <cit>  have also been applied to further reduce the cost of bead cleanups. here we use heat inactivation, thereby circumventing purifications after blunt-ending, a-addition, and adapter ligation. this also reduces the risk of cross-contamination and sample loss during cleanups. the yield of the heat-inactivation protocol is comparable to the standard protocol . <1% of read pairs have different barcodes on their forward and reverse sequences, indicating that the libraries obtained from this protocol have proper adapter ligation. the libraries are high-quality, with 87% mappability and  <dig> % pcr duplicates, . in addition, the coverage of the s. cerevisiae genome yielded by our heat-inactivation protocol was highly uniform and comparable to libraries prepared with the standard illumina protocol . a decrease in coverage was especially observed in regions with low gc content  when the heat-inactivation protocol was applied . this bias is slightly higher compared to the standard protocol , but was negligible for genotyping s. cerevisiae, as less than  <dig> % of the  <dig> bp bins fall in this range. genomes with a 30x coverage had 99% of the genome covered at > =1x and 97% at > =10x coverage. for the data shown here, we used  <dig> ng of fragmented dna for the library preparation. we have also prepared libraries from starting amounts as low as  <dig> ng without a major loss in quality . in principle, this would make the protocol compatible for rna-seq library preparations as well.

barcode bias
in this study, we used a set of  <dig> sequencing adapters containing  <dig> bp barcodes for ligation to the insert as reported by other groups  <cit> . after ligation, equimolar amounts of the barcoded libraries were pooled, size-selected, and amplified. the pooling of the samples before pcr resulted in moderately uneven barcode representation , similar to previous reports  <cit> ; this, however, did not adversely affect our genotyping quality. seven barcodes that displayed extremely poor performance in the pool were excluded in our subsequent studies . we did not observe any particular pattern among the poorly performing barcodes, except that three of them had an “aa” before the t-overhang. no significant barcode bias was observed when the samples were amplified individually and pooled at equimolar concentration before size selection and sequencing . for sample sets with limited dna amounts, we would therefore recommend performing the pcrs individually and to pool equimolar amounts of samples prior to size selection.

recombination map
the sequenced yeast strains were haploid cells obtained by sporulation of a diploid hybrid of s <dig>  and an sk1-derived strain . after removing false positives, approximately  <dig>  snps  were used for genotyping. the average proportion of genotyped snps per segregant was  <dig> %, and increased to  <dig> % after imputation with beagle  <cit> . with this dense marker set and  <dig> genotyped segregants , we generated the highest-resolution recombination map to date . to compare our recombination map to a map previously generated from  <dig> tetrads in an s96xyjm <dig> cross  <cit> , we estimated recombination rates directly from the genotypes of both datasets. we inferred a total of  <dig> recombination events per genome in our s96xsk <dig> segregants, which is significantly lower than the  <dig>  recombination events inferred from the s96xyjm <dig> cross . the total number of recombination events per genome estimated in our dataset is in closer agreement to the number reported by martini et al. in an s96xsk <dig> cross  <cit>  . the recombination rate in our s96xsk <dig> set is lower than the s96xyjm <dig> rate across all chromosomes and is therefore likely to be caused by differences in factors that globally affect meiotic recombination.

recombination distributions between the s96xsk <dig> set and the s96xyjm <dig> set displayed a high correlation on a chromosome wide scale . to investigate possible differences on a local scale, we identified snps that are common between yjm <dig> and sk <dig> and then partitioned the s288c genome into non-overlapping bins  based on these snps. for this window size a lower correlation  was observed. a list of  <dig> regions with the largest differences in normalized recombination rates is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

using the same partitioned bins as described above, we also compared the recombination rate with the genomic double-strand break  map generated by pan et al.  <cit>  . similar to the comparison of our dataset with the s96xyjm <dig> dataset, we observed a good correlation on the chromosome-scale , but a lower one on the finer scale . these differences in hotspot intensities could be due to s96-specific hotspots or the possibility that not all dsbs lead to a detectable recombination event. plotting the distance from the center of spo <dig> oligo hotspots to the center of the s96xsk <dig> recombination events revealed a significant drop in recombination frequency in the vicinity  of the spo <dig> hotspot . this drop could be explained by the 5′ to 3′ resection of the resulting dna ends, required for the repair of dsb by homologous recombination  <cit> .

aneuploidy
using a window size of  <dig> kb, we generated coverage plots of all segregants . in  <dig> % of the segregants , we observed an extra copy of a chromosome . for nine of these segregants, the copy number of the affected chromosome was exactly two and had a 50% allele frequency . these observations indicate a segregation error during the first meiotic division, in which one daughter cell received both sister chromosomes. four of the nine disomies occurred in chromosome  <dig>  . this chromosome might be particularly prone to missegregation because of its small size and substantial structural differences between the parental strains  <cit>  . in agreement with this explanation, a high degree of aneuploidy combined with low frequencies of genetic exchange has previously been observed in a cross between s. cerevisiae and s. paradoxus <cit> . for the other  <dig> aneuploid strains, we observed homozygous calls and a copy number less than  <dig>  suggesting that chromosomal duplications occurred after meiosis and only in a subpopulation of the particular segregant cells, which underwent 20– <dig> mitotic divisions before sequencing. chromosome  <dig> had the highest rate of missegregation . this might be due to the fact that it harbors the ribosomal gene cluster, which makes it the last chromosome to undergo segregation during mitosis  <cit> . chromosome  <dig> disomy may also confer a growth advantage compared to other chromosomal duplications, which generally pose severe consequences or even lethality as reported for chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present various optimization steps for whole dna-seq library preparation, considerably reducing the time and cost for library preparation compared to standard procedures. these include efficient high-throughput dna isolation from yeast cells, a cost-effective alternative to standard covaris fragmentation, and a library preparation that avoids most cleanup steps. the protocol was developed for the illumina platform, but most of the steps are adaptable to other sequencing platforms with minor modifications. the quality of the dna and final library was similar to that obtained by standard techniques. although our heat inactivation step resulted in a slightly reduced coverage of regions with extreme gc content, this did not interfere with genotype calling. the genotype data was also used to map quantitative traits , for which sample size and marker resolution are critical to maximize mapping resolution and statistical power. furthermore, we created a map of meiotic recombination points in yeast with a yet unprecedented resolution as well as a catalog of chromosomal aberrations. despite a high conservation of recombination at a chromosome-wide scale, our results indicate differences at the local scale. we also found an unexpectedly high degree of chromosomal aberrations in this genetic background. in conclusion, our method is a rapid, high-throughput approach for genotyping many small genomes or target-enriched dna, and our results provide a unique basis for future and current studies of aneuploidy and recombination.
