BACKGROUND
line- <dig> elements  are by far the most abundant class of active autonomous transposons in mammalian genomes  <cit> . it has been established that active, i.e. retrotransposition-competent, l <dig> elements in the mouse genome  <cit>  outnumber by many fold those found in the human genome  <cit> . this is reflected in more than an order of magnitude difference in the percentage of spontaneous mutations due to l <dig> activity in mice  compared to that in humans   <cit> . as a result, based on recent experimental and bioinformatic data, one might speculate that the high insertional activity of mouse l1s could play a significant part in shaping the structure and expression of the mouse transcriptome  <cit> . importantly, intronic l <dig> insertions have been shown to influence the expression of their host genes in a wide variety of ways including retardation of transcriptional elongation  <cit> , transcriptional control  <cit> , premature polyadenylation  <cit> , and exon skipping  <cit> .

the process by which l <dig> sequences inserted within introns are recruited into a mrna, termed exonization, has been primarily studied by analysis of the human transcriptome  <cit>  but to date little evidence has been collected for the mouse  <cit> . in this study, we have assessed the exonization potential of currently active mouse l <dig> elements. through detailed analysis of members of active l <dig> families and cdna-supported l <dig> exonization events, we show this potential to be much more significant than previously appreciated. this finding, coupled with the much greater activity of l1s in mouse, suggests that not only have these elements dynamically modified the mouse transcriptome in the past, but continue to do so.

RESULTS
potentially active line-1s in the mouse genome
using l1xplorer  <cit> , a suite of automated l <dig> annotation tools, we identified in the mouse genome sequence   <dig> potentially active l <dig> elements  . this contrasts strongly with the  <dig> potentially active l1s obtained when analyzing the may  <dig> genome release   <cit>  and reflects ongoing finishing of the mouse genome sequence.

transcription of these open reading frames is driven by the mouse l <dig> internal promoter, which is built of a variable number of ~ <dig> nt long repeats called monomers. the sequences of active mouse l1s contain related gf and tf monomers  as well as unrelated a-type monomers. consequently, mouse l1s are classified into subfamilies based on the type of the monomer they harbor  <cit> . notably we have established, by bioinformatic data mining, that whereas the number of potentially active l1s belonging to the gf subfamily agrees with earlier estimates  <cit> , the number of potentially active members of the tf and a subfamilies is ~ <dig> -fold higher than previously  estimated. as a result, based on our analysis of genomic sequence data, we conclude that perhaps as many as ~ <dig>  potentially active l1s reside in the diploid mouse genome.

since l <dig> activity is expected to correlate with l <dig> expression level and the latter has been shown to correlate with the length of the internal promoter  <cit> , we aimed to characterize the promoters of the  <dig> potentially active l <dig> elements which we had discovered . we found that the gf subfamily has the longest average promoter size , followed by the a  and tf  families. the annotation of promoter regions is available at  <cit> .

splice sites in l1s
clearly any dispersed repeat commonly found in intragenic regions has the potential to be exonized due to the fortuitous occurrence of splicing signals in its sequence  <cit> . because of their high number  and the concomitantly increased potential for insertional activity, it is of particular interest to establish whether the sequences belonging to the currently active mouse l <dig> subfamilies  contain functional splice sites. we mined cdna databases  to discover putative mouse exonization events involving these sequences . an overview of the different l <dig> exonization scenarios identified in this study is presented in fig.  <dig> 

fig. 3a contains a summary of antisense  and sense  splice sites in l <dig> sequences, as identified by analysis of cdna sequences. all of these splice donor sites  and splice acceptor sites  are consistent with the classical gt/ag splice junction motifs  <cit> . for details of  <dig> fully annotated examples see:  <cit> .

of the  <dig> discovered events  <dig> involved the exonization of antisense l <dig> sequences. similarly, the authors of a very recent study investigated exonization of transposable elements and reported the greater number of the antisense orientation l <dig> exonization events  <cit> . the observed greater number of l <dig> exonizations in the antisense may result from the antisense orientation bias of intronic l1s .

the most frequently used acceptor and donor splice sites we have identified are sa- <dig>  and sd+ <dig> , supported by  <dig> and  <dig> different cdna transcripts, respectively .

a classic example of sense orientation l <dig> exonization was previously reported when the insertion of a ~ <dig> bp 3' fragment of a l <dig> tf element within an intron of the beige gene caused a disease-specific mutation in mouse  <cit> . usage of the two sd sites, bg_sd+ <dig> and bg_sd+ <dig>  identified in the latter study, was also evident in  <dig> and  <dig> different cdnas, respectively, in our data set .

diverse lengths of exonized l1s
clearly, truncated and rearranged l1s provide different splice sites. the shortest exonized l <dig> insertion we have annotated is only  <dig> bp long  and provides the antisense sa+ <dig> site located at the polyadenylation signal . as shown in this study  the diverse range of lengths of exonized l <dig> insertions renders numerous possibilities for the combinatorial usage of the splice sites. conversely, as evidenced by cdna ak <dig>  two separate antisense  and sense  l <dig> insertions cooperatively provide sd and sa sites to create a l1-derived exon.

evidence for an antisense promoter in mouse l1s
as shown in fig. 3a , we observed an exonization scenario in which first exons are created from intronic antisense l <dig> sequences . in these cases, first exons are spliced to the downstream exons via sd sites present within antisense l <dig> sequences. this might support the existence of regulatory motifs within mouse antisense l <dig> sequences that can initiate transcription, as has been reported for the antisense promoter in human l1s  <cit> . we identified a region of transcriptional start site within the antisense sequence of orf <dig>  which is supported by  <dig> different cdnas . this region could be the site of a novel mouse l <dig> antisense promoter, but experimental studies would be required to confirm this. transcription of l1-derived first exons, that subsequently capture downstream exons which encode intact protein domains, may constitute a mechanism for the generation of novel functional coding transcripts through "gene breaking", as has been described in humans  <cit> . for example, in one of our annotated cdna examples, ak <dig>  the sd+ <dig> site present in ~ <dig> kbp l <dig> tf insertion is used to link l1-derived sequence with downstream exons encoding the c-terminus of dna directed polymerase iota . this mrna transcript, would encode a  <dig> amino acid  protein containing two ubiquitin-binding motifs   <cit> . also in this example, two more splice sites originating from the same ~ <dig> kbp l <dig> tf. insertion, sa+ <dig> and sd+ <dig> generate an l1-derived exon. a similar exonization pattern, leading to first exon generation, is also evident in the transcript ak <dig> where another ~ <dig> kbp l1gf insertion provides sd+ <dig>  sa+ <dig> and sd+ <dig> sites, as well as sa- <dig>  in the latter case sa+ <dig> is substituted for the sa+ <dig> site located nearby .

coding potential of antisense l1-derived exons
provocatively it has been proposed that, in general, repeat exonization via alternative splicing may constitute a vehicle for the exaption of repeat sequences into novel functions  <cit> . in line with this, a recent experimental study demonstrated that arbitrary sequences can evolve towards functionality when fused with other pre-existing protein modules  <cit> .

our analyses of cdnas have revealed that exonized antisense l <dig> sequences have the potential to code for parts of orfs. for example, the alternative transcripts of the gbp- <dig> gene  contain an l1-derived exon which contains sequences from three gf monomers. the antisense sequences of each of the three monomers can be translated into peptides which are ~ <dig> a.a. in length yielding a novel  <dig> a.a. long c-terminus of gbp- <dig> protein . although, clearly, the resulting protein variant is mouse-specific, it was noted that the alternative c-terminus variant of gbp- <dig> exists in humans  and that both mouse and human variants lack the c-terminal caax isoprenylation motif  <cit> , which might be of physiological importance.

exonization potential of active l1s
to examine the exonization potential of active l <dig> elements, we analyzed the residues at the positions corresponding to the cdna-identified splice sites in a set of  <dig> sequences of potentially active l1s. for this, we utilized the l1xplorer annotation pipeline and created a set of customized modules . since all of the identified splice sites were classical gt-ag sites, we defined the presence of these nucleotides as a criterion for a functional splice site. in a total of  <dig> full-length intact line- <dig> elements  <dig> donor and  <dig> acceptor splice sites were annotated .

we rendered sequence logos of the sequences corresponding to the identified acceptor and donor motifs in l1s . in analyzing logos of the acceptor sites we observed polypyrimidine tracts which are typical of consensus splice sites in mouse genes  <cit>  . the presence of these motifs supports the putative functionality of annotated acceptor sites in active l1s.

as illustrated for the case of sa- <dig> site in fig. 5a, family-specific patterns of splice motif conservations are observed in potentially active l <dig> sequences. more cases, such as that of sa+ <dig>  sd+ <dig> sites that are ag/gt intact only in f-type mouse l1s, are highlighted in fig. 5b.

we also found three splice sites sd+ <dig>  sd+ <dig> and sa+ <dig> that are not intact in any subfamily of the potentially active l <dig> sequences and have been generated by single nucleotide mutations leading to functional "gt" and "ag" motifs . the sa+ <dig> acceptor splice site contains the  <dig> bp-long polypyrimidine tract which is present in all sequences of potentially active l1s . thus the single nucleotide t->g mutation could activate this cryptic acceptor splice site in potentially active l <dig> sequences.

splice sites in intronic full-length l <dig> sequences
the amount of l <dig> sequence residing in mouse introns is ~25% of the total genomic l <dig> content and as much as 8% of all intronic sequences are l1-derived nucleotides . this sequence is comprised mostly of truncated l <dig> sequences: according to repeatmasker annotation of ncbim <dig>  more than 92% of intronic l <dig> sequences are less than  <dig> nt long. as shown above, even these short sequences can be subject to exonization. it is expected, however, that intronic full-length  l <dig> insertions have a much higher exonization potential since they contain multiple splice sites and, for example, only fl l1s will include 5' promoter regions containing splice sites.

we identified  <dig> antisense and  <dig> sense intronic fl  l <dig> insertions. as revealed by our l1xplorer annotation, these belong in large part  to the active a, gf and tf families but some  belong to the inactivated f subfamily . similar to potentially active l1s, splice sites are largely intact in intronic fl l <dig> insertions . multiple cdnas confirm exonization of antisense sequences of fl elements . in particular, antisense sequences of two intronic potentially active l <dig> tf elements are exonized via the sd+ <dig> site to create first exons in cdnas ak <dig> and ak <dig> 

by analysing three groups of gene annotations , we identified as many as  <dig> ensembl genes,  <dig> ucsc known genes and  <dig> refseq genes with at least one fl antisense intronic l <dig> insertion and  <dig> ensembl genes,  <dig> ucsc known genes and  <dig> refseq genes that contained at least one intronic fl sense l <dig> insertion. hence, the prediction of potential splice sites within fl intronic l1s may be an important consideration for researchers studying transcripts of particular genes. we have added the annotation of intronic fl l <dig> elements to l1base, which is available at  <cit> .

antisense splice sites vs. antisense l <dig> insertional bias
the existence of antisense splice sites is highly intriguing, particularly in the light of ~ <dig> fold antisense orientation bias of l1s located in introns of transcriptional units  <cit> . this orientation bias is especially evident when comparing regions immediately flanking transcriptional start sites  and transcriptional end sites  .

however, this global picture, which is based on all l <dig> insertions, does not provide information on whether the bias results from processes acting on a long time scales or rather is already reflected in young l <dig> insertions. to gain insight into this issue we specifically looked at young intronic fl l <dig> insertions.

the ratio of antisense to sense fl intronic insertions is ~ <dig>  and chi-square testing established that this ratio is significantly different from random insertion orientation model , where either orientation is equally likely.

we set out to investigate, if this insertional bias is still evident among younger intronic insertions. for this analysis we utilized the set of the potentially active l1s  that were inserted within introns. this is more stringent than analysing fl insertions with disrupted orfs, since elements with intact orfs are likely to be younger due to the l <dig> proteins' cis-preference towards their encoding rna  <cit> . ~28%  of putatively active sequences reside in introns . the chi-square test indicated that this is again highly significantly different from a random insertion model . this result suggests that if insertion orientation is random for de novo insertions, and the observed bias towards antisense insertion occurs due to selection against sense insertions, this selection process is rapid.

the family distribution for the antisense intronic l <dig> insertions  is very similar to the fl l1s in intergenic regions . this is what one would expect to see under the assumption that the sequences of all l <dig> families equally impact the genes they insert into . however, we did observe a difference in the distribution of tf and a subfamilies between intronic sense fl insertions  and intragenic fl insertions . one might argue here that negative selection appears to have acted specifically on the intronic sense l <dig> insertions belonging to the a subfamily, but it is not clear why this might be.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that active mouse l <dig> elements contain functional splice sites within their antisense sequences using evidence from exonization events in mouse cdna libraries. this is especially interesting in the light of the antisense insertional bias of de novo l <dig> insertions. a recent experimental study addressed the molecular nature of this phenomenon by showing that sense insertions of mouse l <dig> tf element reduce transcript levels and impair their structure. by contrast antisense intronic insertions have little or no effect on transcript elongation and abundance  <cit> . these data suggest that the apparently benign nature of antisense intronic insertions and the presence of functional antisense splice sites can lead to the frequent exonization of l <dig> sequences, as we have observed in our dataset. further, the conservation of these splices sites in l <dig> families known to be currently active in the mouse genome strongly implies that generation of l1-exonized transcripts is ongoing, and thus represents a driver of transcriptome evolution. however, it has to be said that this picture is complicated by many factors, particularly since the combination of intronic environment, the size and exact structure of the l <dig> insertion can impact upon its exonization potential, resulting in gene and insertion specific patterns of exonization. with this caveat, the evidence for inclusion of l <dig> sequences in transcripts and the high activity of the many line-1s in the mouse genome, suggests that their integration into introns has significant ongoing potential to shape the structure of the transcriptome, and ultimately, the proteome  <cit> , in the course of evolution.
