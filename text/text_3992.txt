BACKGROUND
during animal development, tissue growth is tightly controlled, leading to adults of defined sizes and proportions. tissue growth is regulated by a combination of patterning cues, which give each tissue a specific identity and hence size, and environmental cues, which are sensed through nutrient responsive pathways and act to proportionately scale the whole animal  <cit> . despite intense interest in understanding how tissue growth is controlled, the underlying molecular mechanisms are only partly understood. the drosophila wing has become one model system that is frequently used to study this problem. growth of the fly wing is promoted via signals emanating from the anterior/posterior  and dorsal/ventral  compartment boundaries, such as dpp and wingless respectively  <cit> . although wingless appears to be the main growth-promoting signal emanating from the d/v boundary, a second notch-induced signal at the d/v boundary also non-autonomously induces wing growth  <cit> . the wingless paralog wnt <dig> is also expressed at the d/v boundary  <cit> . therefore, we decided to test whether wnt <dig> might constitute this second signal.

drosophila is one of the model systems in which wnt signaling and function have been most intensively studied. drosophila has seven wnt genes. of these, the best understood is wingless, the founding member of the class. wingless has a myriad of functions during development. one function is to pattern epidermal cells to form repetitive patterns of naked cuticle and denticle belts, small tooth-like structures used for traction during larval crawling  <cit> . wingless is also necessary for development of all imaginal discs – the tissues resident in the larva which will give rise to adult tissues during metamorphosis. for instance, in the wing disc, early expression is responsible for specifying the wing primordium whereas later expression sets up the d/v axis of the wing  <cit> . the remaining wnts are comparatively less well studied; nonetheless, some functions are known for four of the remaining wnts: wnt <dig> is involved in axon guidance as well as salivary gland migration, wnt <dig> regulates salivary gland migration, tracheal development and testis morphogenesis, wnt <dig> is part of the toll/dorsal signaling network which both specifies the d/v axis of the embryo and participates in the immune response, whereas wnt <dig> is critical for the regulation of cell motility during ovarian morphogenesis . the functions of wnt <dig> and wnt <dig>  however, are not known.

wnt <dig> function has been studied in xenopus, where it was found to be expressed in tissues close to and inside the developing heart, where it regulates heart organogenesis  <cit> . since, to our knowledge, wnt <dig> mutant flies have not been reported, we generated wnt <dig> knockout flies. we find that wnt <dig> knockout flies, however, do not have growth defects in the wing. instead, they completely lack maxillary palps. together with antenna, maxillary palps are one of two olfactory epithelia in drosophila <cit> . recent studies suggest maxillary palps might also be involved in taste enhancement  <cit> . the function of maxillary palps as an olfactory organ is well conserved throughout insects. for instance, mosquitos use maxillary palps to smell co <dig>  which is used for host seeking behavior  <cit> . hence, since wnt <dig> knockout flies lack maxillary palps, they might constitute a useful tool for studying olfaction and behavior  <cit> .

RESULTS
wnt <dig> knockout flies lack maxillary palps
to study the developmental function of wnt <dig> in drosophila, we generated wnt <dig> knockout  flies by targeted homologous recombination, entirely removing the third exon and, hence, a substantial portion of the coding sequence , yielding flies with no detectable wnt <dig> transcript . wnt6ko flies are viable and fertile and have no obvious defects in wing size . the wing margin, specified via wingless signaling, appears intact, and there is no obvious planar cell polarity  phenotype . in sum, wnt <dig> does not seem to regulate wing size or pcp signaling. wnt6ko animals, however, completely lack maxillary palps, structures used by flies for olfaction figure 1d-d’ and additional file 2: figure s2)  <cit> . we asked whether reintroducing wnt <dig> expression via a uas transgene would rescue maxillary palp formation in the wnt6ko. to our knowledge, however, no gal <dig> drivers exist with maxillary palp-specific expression. we, therefore, expressed uas-wnt <dig> ubiquitously in the nervous system of wnt6ko flies, including the maxillary palp anlage, using elav-gal <dig>  this leads to expression both in the maxillary palp territory as well as elsewhere. although this caused morphological defects, such as small heads and glazed eyes, this rescued maxillary palp formation , confirming that the defect is specific for wnt <dig> loss of function. 

wnt <dig> can activate canonical wnt signaling and is required for proper positioning of wing margin chemosensory bristles
since wnt6ko flies do not have pcp phenotypes, we tested whether wnt <dig> can activate canonical wnt signaling. indeed, in s <dig> cells, wnt <dig> was able to induce expression of a wnt-responsive lef7-luciferase reporter  <cit>  in a manner similar to wingless . given that wnt <dig> can activate canonical wingless signaling, we were surprised that loss of wnt <dig> did not lead to obvious wing margin defects. one possible explanation could be that wnt <dig> is expressed at lower levels than wingless in the wing disc. indeed, quantitative rt-pcr on rna extracted from wing discs confirmed this to be the case . a second possible explanation that is not mutually exclusive with the first is that wnt <dig> might be less effective at activating wingless signaling in the wing disc compared to wingless. indeed, expression of wingless with patched-gal <dig> in a domain along the a/p boundary, perpendicular to its normal expression domain, caused ectopic expression of canonical target genes, such as senseless  and distalless  . in contrast, expression of wnt <dig> in this same domain had no clear effect on sens or dll expression . in sum, in the wing disc wnt <dig> appears to induce wnt signaling significantly less strongly than wingless itself. we, therefore, asked whether wnt6ko flies might have a mild wingless loss-of-function phenotype in the wing that had escaped our initial inspection. wingless signaling specifies the mechanosensory and chemosensory bristles along the anterior wing margin  <cit> , with the spacing between chemosensory bristles normally being four times larger than the spacing between stout mechanosensory bristles . we noticed that the spacing of chemosensory bristles in wnt6ko wings tends to be less precisely specified, with a reduced average distance and a broader spacing distribution, compared to controls . the same was observed for flies with reduced wingless signaling due to heterozygosity for a wingless amorphic allele  .

wnt <dig> is expressed in the maxillary palp anlage
previous work has shown that wnt signaling in the maxillary palp anlage is required for growth of the maxillary palp  <cit> . indeed, as previously reported  <cit> , anti-wingless antibody 4d <dig> detects a protein in the maxillary palp territory of the eye-antenna disc of control animals , suggesting wingless might be the ligand activating the pathway. this antibody signal, however, is gone in wnt6ko animals . one possible explanation is that induction or maintenance of wingless expression requires wnt <dig>  however, we could not find any cross-talk between wnt <dig> and wingless expression; expression of wnt <dig> using patched-gal <dig> did not induce wingless expression and vice-versa . an alternate explanation is that the anti-wingless 4d <dig> antibody might cross-react with wnt <dig> protein. indeed, expression of wnt <dig> in s <dig> cells yielded a clear signal with anti-wingless 4d <dig> antibody on an immunoblot . consistent with this explanation, by in situ hybridization we could detect wnt <dig> expression and not wingless expression in the maxillary palp anlage , suggesting that the antibody staining might be detecting wnt <dig> and not wingless. in sum it appears that canonical wnt signaling in response to wnt <dig> ligand is responsible for maxillary palp formation, although we cannot exclude the possibility that wnt <dig> is promoting maxillary palp growth via a non-canonical pathway.

evolutionary loss of wnt <dig> correlates with loss of maxillary palps
since wnt6ko flies lack maxillary palps, we asked whether the presence or absence of maxillary palps across hexapods correlates with the presence or absence of the wnt <dig> gene. hexapods include ectognaths  and entognaths . the minute, wingless entognaths have three orders, protura, diplura and collembola, and represent the sister group to insects  <cit> . maxillary palps are present in most insects and also in entognaths, indicating that the structure was present in their last common ancestor. notably among the insects, aphids and other hemipterans lack maxillary palps due to evolutionary loss . a survey of  <dig> insect species for which complete genomic information is available revealed that all of these species have a wnt <dig> gene except the aphid, acyrthosiphon pisum <cit> , and the jumping plant lice  diaphorina citri , both belonging to hemiptera. wg/wnt <dig>  the closest paralog to wnt <dig>  <cit> , and other wnts are present in a. pisum <cit>  and could also be identified it in the d. citri genome  <cit> . this finding suggests that loss of wnt <dig> may have led to the loss of maxillary palps also on the evolutionary timescale during hemipteran evolution.

discussion
wnt <dig> appears to have a specific role during drosophila development, promoting maxillary palp formation. this is surprising, given that wnt <dig> is quite ancient and present in most bilaterians  <cit> . one possible interpretation is that the wnt <dig> function might be redundant in most parts of the animal, perhaps due to overlapping expression with wingless, whereas wnt <dig> expression in the maxillary palp might have been acquired in insects in a non-redundant fashion. this specific function in promoting maxillary palp formation might serve as a useful tool for studying the contribution of maxillary palps to olfaction and behavior. the maxillary palp contribution is currently assayed by surgical removal of the palps, whereas this could now also be accomplished genetically  <cit> .

as previously noted  <cit> , the wnt <dig> gene is located directly adjacent to the wingless gene, raising the possibility that it arose as a genomic duplication of wingless. accordingly, wnt <dig> expression overlaps with that of wingless in numerous places  <cit> . one possible reason for the overlapping expression patterns could be that wnt <dig> expression is induced by wingless signaling; however, our data suggest this is not the case . instead, it is likely that they either share enhancer elements or that regulatory elements were also duplicated alongside the open reading frame. since wingless and wnt <dig> have similar expression patterns and presumably transcriptional regulation, and since the anti-wingless monoclonal antibody 4d <dig>  the most widely-used in the field to detect wingless, appears to cross-react with wnt <dig>  some caution might be warranted in interpreting results with this antibody.

given that wnt <dig> is able to induce canonical wingless signaling in s <dig> cells , we were surprised that wnt <dig> is quite poor at inducing wingless signaling in the wing disc . consistent with this observation, expression of uas-wnt <dig> with various gal <dig> drivers such as patchedts-gal <dig>  and nubbin-gal <dig> cause pupal lethality; however, this does not yield obvious morphological defects in the resulting wings , suggesting that the lethality is likely due to expression in other parts of the body. in contrast, wnt <dig> expression in the central nervous system, including the maxillary palp, induces obvious significant morphological effects. one possible explanation could be that a component required for wnt <dig> signaling might be expressed at higher levels in the nervous system compared to wing discs.

the specific absence of wnt <dig> from the aphid a. pisum and the plant lice d. citri, both belonging to the order hemiptera, a group that has lost maxillary palps, suggests that wnt6-loss could have been the underlying genetic alteration leading to this morphological change. in hemipterans, the mouthparts are modified to form a tube-like structure for piercing. the tube, formed by the labrum and labium, comprises piercing-sucking structures formed by the modified mandible and the maxilla  <cit> . the evolutionary loss of the maxillary palps was one of many structural modifications leading to the specialized hemipteran mouthparts. the loss of the maxillary palps could have compromised the sense of smell in hemipteran ancestors, but this may have been compensated by the elaboration of sensory structures on the labium  <cit> . the specific phenotype of the wnt <dig> knock-out in drosophila contrasts with the pleiotropic effects of other secreted signaling molecules including wingless. this means that the deletion of the gene, rather than tinkering with its regulatory regions, could have resulted in a subtle morphological change, the loss of the maxillary palp, contributing to the morphological evolution of the beak-like hemipteran mouthparts.

CONCLUSIONS
although wnt <dig> expression overlaps substantially with that of wingless, it appears to play a critical role in maxillary palp growth, but not wing growth. phylogenetic analysis suggests that loss of wnt <dig> also correlates with loss of maxillary palps on an evolutionary timescale.
