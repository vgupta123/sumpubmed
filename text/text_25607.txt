BACKGROUND
selective breeding to ameliorate stress susceptibility has long been established in terrestrial vertebrates of economical relevance  <cit> , but cultured fish are essentially non-domesticated species and selection programs for growth and stress traits are still in their infancy  <cit> . in salmonids, however, a genetic component exists for the stress-mediated response of cortisol  <cit> , and selective breeding for low- and high-cortisol responders has been performed in rainbow trout  after handling and exposure to a confinement stressor  <cit> . in carp , a high heritability has also been found for the stress-related increases in plasma cortisol levels after cold shock exposure  <cit> . progeny of gilthead sea bream  from parents selected for low- or high-cortisol response also show divergent responses  <cit> , although in this species low-cortisol responders can be more sensitive to handling and confinement  <cit> . this finding is indicative that parameters other than plasma cortisol levels must be considered to fully understand the regulation of stress responsiveness and susceptibility. for instance, the cortisol peak is indicative in gilthead sea bream of the intensity and duration of stressor when data found in the literature are compared, but a bimodal rise after acute stress confinement has been reported by some authors  <cit> , which would be indicative of some exhaustion of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis. by contrast, protein and transcript levels of glucose-regulated protein  <dig> , a mitochondrial chaperone of the hsp <dig> family, are increased by both acute and chronic stress confinement in liver tissue  <cit> . in addition, transcriptional and promoter analyses of duplicated growth hormone receptors  indicate that ghr-ii rather than ghr-i is a stress sensitive gene in gilthead sea bream  <cit> .

with the advent of "omic" technologies, a significant portion, if not all, of the set of transcripts, proteins or metabolites that a study wishes to consider can be determined in one assay. cdna- and oligo-arrays are in fact powerful tools for the gene expression profiling of many thousands of genes, and various zebrafish , medaka  and fugu  microarrays have been developed for toxicogenomics, immunity, development and environmental stress research  <cit> . genomic resources in fish species of interest in aquaculture are also continuously growing and species-specific microarrays are now available in salmonids  <cit> , flatfish  <cit>  and catfish  <cit> . in the case of gilthead sea bream, a highly cultured fish throughout the mediterranean, a first microarray with  <dig>  clones from a cdna library of embryonic and larval origin has been developed by sarropoulou et al.  <cit>  to analyze gene expression profile during early development and cortisol treatment. recently, a second microarray has been constructed and used in developmental studies by ferraresso et al.  <cit> . the aim of the current study is to gain more understanding of the physiology of the stress response using a third gilthead sea bream microarray, enriched by subtractive hybridization  with stress and immunorelevant genes. time series analyses of data revealed the complexity of the adaptive stress response and underscore the utility of this custom-made array to analyze homeostatic adjustments to stress. this understanding will have practical implications on fish culture and management.

RESULTS
microarray construction
a total of  <dig>  gilthead sea bream nucleotide sequences were available for the construction of a cdna sea bream microarray. most were sequenced either from tissue est collections made available by the consortium of marine genomics europe or from ssh libraries constructed, as described herein, from target tissues after stress and parasite challenges , and some were obtained from public databases. the number of assembled sequences was  <dig> :  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  contigs with two or more ests in depth . clone sequences derived from confinement and pathogen ssh libraries  were represented in  <dig>  unique sequences, and most of these  were novel gilthead sea bream sequences. the entire list of assembled sequences was annotated by blastx search on the uniprot database and  <dig>  unique sequences showed a significant similarity  to known genes. taking into account contigs that were homologous to the same gene, the final number of unique genes on the microarray was  <dig> . this platform has been assigned the gene expression omnibus  accession number gpl <dig>  it was possible to assign gene ontology  annotations to  <dig>  features and the most prevalent go categories at level  <dig>  are summarized in table  <dig> 

expression analysis
to analyze the time course of the response to stress, fish of 110- <dig> g body weight were sampled at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after transfer from 500-l tanks  to cylinder net baskets of 10-l volume . given this body weight,, the rearing density for control fish is near to optimum for gilthead sea bream. the analysis of the hepatic gene expression profile after 10-fold increase in fish density  identified  <dig> unique transcripts as differentially expressed genes . among these,  <dig> transcripts were annotated genes, and the time course of changes in up- and down-regulated genes at each sampling point is shown in figure 1a. after  <dig> h of confinement, a relative low number of genes  were differentially expressed. the maximal number of differentially expressed genes  was attained at  <dig> h, and after that the number of differentially expressed genes decreased progressively to  <dig> at  <dig> h. analysis by blast2go revealed the involvement of these differentially expressed genes in a wide variety of processes including among others biosynthetic processes, transport, cell communication, response to stress and regulation of metabolism and catabolism .

k-means clustering of differentially expressed genes identified four major expression patterns displaying distinct temporal profiles . the first cluster set was composed of  <dig> genes that showed an early up-regulation at  <dig> h after confinement. the second cluster set was composed of  <dig> genes that displayed a delayed and strong up-regulation at  <dig> h with a fast recovery to control levels by  <dig> h. the third cluster set was composed of  <dig> genes with a late but more sustained stress induction that was still evident after  <dig> h of confinement exposure. the fourth cluster set was composed of  <dig> genes that showed a persistent down-regulation at  <dig> h through to  <dig> h of confinement exposure.

in each k-means cluster, fatigo analysis for the over-representation of go-terms suggested the enrichment in some biological processes, although adjusted p-values  did not fall in the range of statistical significance . the entire list of up-regulated genes  is shown in additional file  <dig>  the most distinctive feature of set  <dig> is the presence of genes involved in tissue uptake and intracellular transport of fatty acids , cysteine metabolism  and oxidoreductase activity  in addition to a repertoire of genes related to the reset of stress response , apoptosis  and cell proliferation . many genes of set  <dig> are involved in tissue repair and remodeling processes through the enhancement of the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum  and er-associated protein degradation. this set includes among other enzymes and chaperones, derlin- <dig>  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> n, ubiquitin-protein ligase d <dig>   <dig> kda glucose-regulated protein, and  <dig> kda glucose-regulated protein. this cluster also comprises a large set of genes involved in the regulation of transcription and translation , as well as cholesterol and sterol biosynthesis . set  <dig> is abundant in inhibitors of protein breakdown , protein targeting and glycosylation  and vesicle-mediated transport . also in set  <dig>  a number of genes participate in sterol metabolism, cytoskeleton rearrangements , immune response  and antioxidant defense through their involvement in iron metabolism , oxygen transport  and glutathione synthesis and recycling .

down-regulated genes  are listed in table  <dig> and reveal a metabolic readjustment mediated by the depletion of many proteins and enzymes involved in amino acid and nucleotide metabolism , glycolysis , mitochondrial respiration , xenobiotic metabolism  and immune response through a wide range of processes: acute immune response , antigen binding and processing , lectin pathway , histamine metabolism , and inflammatory and interferon signaling .

real-time pcr validation
the  <dig> target genes selected for validation of microarray data covered the full range of signal intensity and fold-change results. their hepatic expression profiles determined by real-time pcr are represented in figure 3a. in the range of low and intermediate fold-changes, overall data revealed a good correlation between real-time pcr and microarray results . however, the dynamic range of the microarray is lower than that of the pcr assay, and gene expression changes are under-estimated by the microarray in the upper range of down- and up-regulated changes , which becomes evident when data on figure 3b are represented in a linear scale instead of a logarithmic scale.

discussion
the ssh technique has been widely used in various animal models to identify tissue-specific or differentially expressed genes between populations of interest  <cit> . the sensitivity of this methodology is lower than previously envisaged, but in gilthead sea bream this approach has been used successfully for the identification of differentially expressed genes after estradiol treatment  <cit>  and nodavirus infection  <cit> . in the present study, this technique has also proved successful for the isolation of a relatively high number of novel annotated sequences  which have been used to construct a new gilthead sea bream microarray, contributing to the improvement of genomic resources for a marine fish highly cultured throughout the mediterranean.

in fish and higher vertebrates, the stress response involves changes in plasma glucocorticoids, catecholamines and other classical stress parameters  <cit> . in the case of gilthead sea bream, endocrine and metabolic responses to handling and confinement exposure have been analyzed in some detail  <cit> , but this is the first attempt at an extensive transcriptional study to monitor the dynamics of the stress response. given the central role of liver in many homeostatic processes, this organ was targeted for the study and cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes identifying four sets of either up-  or down-regulated  genes. as summarized in figure  <dig>  this gene expression profiling shows the complexity of the stress response with early, delayed and persistent adaptive responses which underscore cell-tissue specific adjustments: a) rapid enhancement of energy supply, b) tissue repair and remodeling processes and c) re-establishment of redox balance.

metabolic rates are increased by stress  <cit> , and the concomitant high energy demand is supported by a rapid mobilization and enhanced tissue uptake of metabolic fuels. lipids are the most important energy source in carnivorous fish  <cit> , and the stress up-regulation of genes involved in lipid transport and fatty acid metabolism points toward the increased availability of energy substrates. at vascular surfaces, lipoprotein lipase  catalyzes the hydrolysis of circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins acting as a limiting enzyme on tissue fatty acid uptake  <cit> . in gilthead sea bream, the up-regulated expression of lpl is a well documented phenomenon in fish with signs of essential fatty acid deficiencies leading to increase lipid deposition rates in the liver tissue  <cit> . in the present study therefore, the increased expression of hepatic lpl as part of the early stress response was not surprising. similarly, handling stress also induces the rapid up-regulation of hepatic lpl in rainbow trout  <cit> .

in addition to lpl, other genes involved in lipid metabolism were up-regulated early at  <dig> h after stress confinement. acid cholesteryl ester hydrolase, also termed lysosomal acid lipase, hydrolyzes triglycerides and cholesterol esters after lipoprotein endocytosis leading to increases in the cell availability of fatty acids as metabolic fuels. this up-regulation is in agreement with the observations made in mouse and zebrafish models, of enhancement of lysosomal acid lipase by heat shock  <cit>  or hypoxia-associated stress  <cit> . in the present study, the up-regulation of lysosomal acid lipase coincided with the increased expression of heart-type fatty acid-binding protein. members of this protein family act as intracellular transporters of fatty acids by trafficking their ligands via interactions with organelle membranes and specific proteins  <cit> . this transport system ensures a suitable use of, and destination for fatty acids within the cell in each metabolic scenario. therefore in our model, and perhaps others of increased energy demand, the up-regulation of cytoplasmic fatty acid binding proteins could facilitate the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and may contribute to the protection of the cell against the lipotoxic effects of fatty acids in a changing and oxidative cellular environment. for instance, there are an increasing number of reports that deficiencies or altered functioning of both membrane-associated and cytoplasmic lipid binding proteins are associated with disease states, such as obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis  <cit> .

the transition from normal to stress conditions compromises cell survival and function and this fact could be in concordance with the early induction of apoptotic signals  observed in this study. at the same time, however, the expression of several mitotic and cell proliferation factors  was enhanced, which could be indicative not only of redundant and overlapping genes but also of complex homeostatic adjustments to stress. complex trade-off among apoptotic and proliferative factors were also in evidence when genes clustered in sets  <dig> and  <dig> were considered. cell specific adjustments of apoptotic/proliferative pathways seem therefore to be a part of the complex time course of the stress response in gilthead sea bream in order to aid cellular homeostasis. this complex response has been described elsewhere in mammals and other fish species subsequent to toxicological, environmental and stress-disease challenges  <cit> .

from our results it can also be concluded that cholesterol and sterol metabolism are transcriptionally mediated by stress confinement in gilthead sea bream. indeed, several genes annotated with the go-terms 'cholesterol biosynthetic process' and 'sterol biosynthetic process' belong to set  <dig> -sterol reductase, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, farnesyl diphosphate synthetase), to set  <dig>  and to set  <dig> . since cortisol is a cholesterol-derived steroid, these transcriptional changes can be viewed as extensive processes aimed to maintain cortisol and steroid production in order to meet the needs of the stress response. as a matter of fact, a recently published study by saera-vila et al.  <cit> , with plasma samples coming from the present study, demonstrated a bimodal stress-response of cortisol with a fast and transient peak at  <dig>  h followed by a second and more persistent peak at  <dig> h that would be non-transcriptionally- and transcriptionally-mediated, respectively. the same trend is found when only samples from animals used for microarray analysis are considered . similarly, arends et al.  <cit>  reported a bimodal cortisol response after handling and air exposure, which might highlight some initial exhaustion of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis of gilthead sea bream when exposing fish to acute aquaculture stressors.

also at  <dig> h after stress confinement, our results suggested the overall activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, possibly as part of the acute stress response to counteract oxidative stress and the associated cellular damage. thus, chaperones  are clustered in set  <dig> and were strongly up-regulated in order to increase the cytoplasmic and er protein folding capacity. er chaperones assist the folding of nascent chains and help to achieve an active conformation for mature proteins  <cit> . in a process referred to as quality control only correctly folded proteins are exported to the golgi complex, while incompletely folded proteins are retained in the er to complete the folding process or be targeted for degradation  <cit> . er-associated protein degradation  is, therefore, a process that involves retrotranslocation into the cytosol and proteasome-mediated proteolysis. ubiquitin, a major player in the proteasomal pathway of protein degradation, is stress activated in fish  <cit>  and ubiquitin mrna levels are increased after applying a handling stressor in rainbow trout  <cit> . however, the novel observation from our study is the increased abundance  of transcripts encoding for proteins involved in erad and er translocation. of interest later in the time course  is the dominance of transcripts encoding for extracellular  and proteasomal  inhibitors of proteolysis in addition to those involved in protein glycosylation, endocytosis and vesicle-mediated transport. collectively, these findings provide evidence of shifts in protein breakdown and general protein synthesis leading to the complex homeostatic adjustments of protein metabolism to stress. of particular interest is the up-regulation of clathrin and ras-related proteins which have an accepted role as vesicle-assembly proteins  <cit> , although the physiological regulation of these proteins on intracellular protein transport and trafficking has not been reported yet in fish.

the enhanced expression of cytoskeleton and cell motility genes is also part of the late stress response that belongs to set  <dig>  these transcriptional-mediated effects are indicative of a general strategy to generate new cytoskeleton proteins for replacement of the degraded ones, or extensive cytoskeleton reorganization for overall tissue repair and remodeling processes  <cit> . this adaptive stress response also necessitates the late readjustment of the redox status, which involves a wide range of genes with oxido-reductase activity. thus, among the genes clustered on set  <dig>  some play a cytoprotective role against oxidative insults promoting the synthesis of cysteine and reducing nadph equivalents for glutathione synthesis and recycling. in addition, other genes promote the enhanced scavenging of reactive oxygen species . in this regard, the up-regulated expression of hemoglobin subunit β and ferroxidase, also named ceruloplasmin, was of particular interest. transcripts levels of α- and β-globin subunits of the hemoglobin  molecule are increased in gilthead sea bream under extreme farming conditions  <cit> , but the antioxidant effect may also be one of the essential functions of hb when expressed in the non-erythroid cells of liver tissue. indeed, the involvement of hb in the protection of cells against nitrosative stress is a long-time recognized process  <cit> , but hb can also detoxify highly oxidizing radicals, yielding the ferric state as reported by nishi et al.  <cit>  in rat mesenglial cells. likewise, ceruloplasmin is an important regulator of hepatic iron metabolism acting as well as a blood copper-carrier and ros scavenger  <cit> . in fish, a cause-effect relationship has not yet been established, but the stress-mediated effects of ceruloplasmin in antioxidant defense are supported by its up-regulated expression not only in this, but also in other models of handling and confinement stress in rainbow trout  <cit>  and of hypoxia-associated stress in cobia  <cit> .

ros production is inherent to aerobic metabolism and most of the beneficial effects of caloric restrictions are attributed to a reduced oxidative stress  <cit> . it is not surprising, therefore, that a reduced energy demand is one of the mechanisms operating in the adaptation to chronic stress  <cit> . for instance, glycolytic enzymes  and mitochondrial respiratory electron carriers  were down-regulated from  <dig> h through to  <dig> h . liver is also the most important target tissue for detoxifying processes and the depletion of xenobiotic metabolism is also one of the potential ways to reduce ros production  <cit> . in the present study, this notion is supported by the down-regulated expression of several enzymes of the cytochrome p <dig> family, which play a central role in the oxidative metabolism of many endogenous and exogenous substrates  <cit> . among these, one of the most studied enzymes is cyp p <dig> 1a <dig>  which exhibits reduced expression in the liver of gilthead sea bream with reduced loadings of feed-borne contaminants  <cit> . also, reduced expression is found in the liver of common dentex , a very stress susceptible fish of the sparidae family, when mrna transcript levels are compared to those found in gilthead sea bream  <cit> . furthermore, our results indicate that retinol-binding protein, a known estrogenic biomarker  <cit> , was persistently down-regulated over the course of stress confinement. as far as we know, there is no information in fish about the stress-mediated response of retinol-binding protein. however, the key role of this hepatic protein in fish vitellogenesis is well established  <cit> , and its lowered expression could partly explain the impaired fish reproductive performance under confinement and extreme farming  <cit> .

stress is reported to modulate the fish immune functions, although the net effect on the immune system is dependent on the intensity of the stressor. in the short term, acute stress may enhance both cellular and humoral components of fish innate defenses  <cit> . on the other hand, as glucocorticoid hormones such as cortisol have immunosuppressive effects, chronic stress is considered to be detrimental to fish immune function  <cit> . in the present work, stress adaptation after  <dig> h involves a complicated balance of up- and down-regulation of genes that activate or suppress innate and adaptive immune functions . similar results have been reported in the liver transcriptome of rainbow trout after  <dig> h of low-water stress, with a down-regulation of c-type lectins, and up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex components, interferon inducible proteins and complement factors  <cit> . bearing in mind the potential that an immune response has as a source of ros, this profile of expression for sea bream immune genes may reflect not only the maintenance of some specific immune functions, but also the necessity to prevent tissue-oxidative damage associated with a chronic stress condition.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we analyzed the time course of the stress response in gilthead sea bream and the results highlight early, delayed and persistent responses which lead to the attainment of a new steady state, and emphasize the complexity of the adaptive stress response. the er is considered an important control point for the acute and homeostatic adjustments to stress, but later changes in energy demand, oxido-reductase activity and immunological competence are also envisaged. the microarray developed in this study will therefore be suitable for the transcriptional phenotyping of gilthead sea bream welfare and performance, several studies, for example, are now underway for the multivariate analysis of stress dynamics in relation to nutrition, genotype and stress interactions. preliminary results are highly promising and practical implications for a more robust and suitable evaluation of new fish feed formulations based on plant ingredients are now possible using these newly established genomic tools.
