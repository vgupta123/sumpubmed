BACKGROUND
because of its biological importance, the pdz  domain has been intensively studied at the structural and functional level. proteins containing pdz domains frequently serve as molecular scaffolds, which assemble signaling complexes needed for efficient and specific signal transduction at defined sub-cellular sites, such as at polarized epithelial cell junctions, or synapses in neurons  <cit> . early work indicated a preferential interaction between pdz domains and the c-terminal amino acids of target proteins  <cit> . in some cases, removal of the  <dig> c-terminal residues of the partner protein abrogates interaction with the pdz domain  <cit> . much subsequent effort has been put into bioinformatic studies and small- and large-scale screens to refine the exact sequence of this presumed c-terminal motif  <cit> , leading to several consensus sequences, with different degrees of refinement . individual proteins can contain multiple pdz domains. for example, the human multiple pdz domain protein  has  <dig>  when their interactions with other proteins have been dissected, the different pdz domains of a single protein often have been found to have distinct binding partners . pdz domain proteins have also been used in the context of large-scale searches for protein partners. for example, global interactome studies with c. elegans proteins assayed the interactions of  <dig> of the nematode's  <dig> pdz domain proteins. although these  <dig> proteins were found to be involved in  <dig> interactions, whether the different pdz domains played a direct role was not addressed  <cit> . no comprehensive, proteome-wide screen using all pdz domains, however, has been reported for any organism.

here, we describe the characterization and cloning of every single one of the  <dig> pdz domains from c. elegans. we generated a versatile resource, with each domain in the gateway system, allowing facile transfer to different expression systems. as an example, we made a yeast array of the  <dig> pdz domains and provide a proof-of-principle for its application to the discovery of pdz domain targets for any protein or peptide of interest. in addition, from a separate yeast two-hybrid  screen, we identified more than  <dig> potential partners for these domains. a large number of these interactions were independently validated using a co-immunoprecipitation approach. an analysis of these interactors implicates pdz domains in a broad range of cellular functions. unexpectedly, many of the interactions did not involve a c-terminal consensus sequence, suggesting that pdz domains frequently bind their partners in a hitherto uncharacterized mode.

RESULTS
an interactome map for pdz domains
we chose to define the interaction partners of all the pdz-domain proteins in c. elegans. through an exhaustive cross-database search, we identified a total of  <dig> pdz domains in  <dig> distinct proteins, not counting isoforms sharing domains . among these pdz-domain containing proteins, only 44% were associated with any gene ontology annotation based on experimental data . the dna for all  <dig> domains was amplified and cloned. the insert for each clone was sequenced-verified, and this comprehensive clonal collection, in the gateway entry vector allowing rapid transfer into multiple other vectors  <cit> , is available as a community resource upon request. the inserts were all transferred into a db-vector and used in high-stringency y2h screens against the non-normalized cdna library ad-wrmcdna  <cit> . we pulled out  <dig> interactions involving  <dig> interacting proteins and  <dig> individual pdz domains.  <dig> pdz domains were auto-activators and therefore not included in the screen, thus 81% of the pdz domains gave at least  <dig> interaction, with a mean of  <dig> interacting proteins . as expected, there was limited overlap with the results of the previous global c. elegans y2h screens due in part to the incomplete and disparate degrees of coverage , and the domain-nature of the current screen. we did observe a clear bias towards proteins containing c-terminal class i consensus motifs . one striking observation, however, was the high frequency  of interacting proteins that did not possess a classical c-terminal consensus sequence . this trend was maintained even when interacting proteins that had multiple pdz-domain partners were counted only once in the analysis . this opened the possibility to perform a second screen using the ad-orfeome library  <cit> , which has the advantage of being highly normalized. in this library, the stop codon of each insert is replaced by the b <dig> recombination sequence, giving rise to proteins with a constant non-native c-terminal extension. these additional  <dig> amino acids  do not correspond to the consensus binding sequence for native pdz-domains. using this library, we identified a total of  <dig> interactions involving  <dig> interacting proteins and  <dig> pdz domains . these included  <dig> in common with the cdna screen. this degree of overlap  is slightly lower than that reported  <cit>  for previous screens against the two libraries , possibly reflecting the fact that our pdz domain screen is biased towards native c-terminus consensus motifs, which are not accessible in the ad-orfeome library. within these  <dig> pdz domains , the prevalence of c-terminal consensus sequences in the interacting proteins reflected that seen in the proteome as a whole . taken together, these results suggest that some pdz domains might interact with their target ligands outside the c-terminus much more often than expected.

proportions of c-terminal consensus classes for interacting proteins identified in ad-wrmcdna and ad-orfeome screens compared with proportions of c-terminal consensus classes in the complete c. elegans proteome  are given. consensus class 1: x, consensus class  <dig> x, consensus class  <dig> x . upper panel: proportions calculated using all pdz-interacting protein pairs, lower panel: proportions calculated using each interacting protein only once when interacting with multiple pdz domains .

characteristics of pdz domain interacting proteins
pooling the results from the two screens, we obtained  <dig> interactions involving  <dig> proteins and  <dig> pdz domains . in many cases, single proteins were found to interact with multiple pdz domains , consistent with the known promiscuity of ligand-pdz domain interactions  <cit> . gene ontologies   <cit>  analysis are limited by the fact that only 182/ <dig> proteins have attributes inferred from experimental evidence. we therefore opted to extend this analysis with a manual curation of our protein set based principally on wormbase  <cit>  annotations . pdz domains have long been known to be involved in the scaffolding of proteins complexes at the plasma membrane thus contributing to the signaling specificity of many receptors, notably at the synapse  <cit> , or to the establishment and maintenance of epithelial polarity  <cit> . indeed, just under half of the functionally annotated proteins are involved in signaling , structural maintenance or transport. the annotation of the other pdz interacting proteins reveals a broad range of functions ranging from metabolism, ubiquitination, rna binding and processing to transcriptional regulation . interestingly some studies indicate nuclear roles for pdz domain proteins. for example, the junctional protein zo- <dig> directly interacts in the nucleus with the dna-binding protein scaffold attachment factor-b   <cit> .

frequent use of non-consensus binding confirmed by co-ip
it is well established that some y2h interactions do not reflect a physiologically relevant binding events between proteins. ideally, these interactions need to be validated in vivo. such tests are fastidious and not compatible with large-scale studies. we therefore sought to assay a subset of our y2h interactions, using a very distinct experimental system, namely co-affinity immunoprecipitations  from human 293t cells. first, we choose  <dig> different interactions, found in the cdna screen, involving  <dig> pdz domains and  <dig> interacting proteins. all these interactions were detected by co-ip using constructs encompassing the pdz interacting full-length proteins, with their native c-terminus . we then extended the co-ip test and used b2-tagged constructs, i.e. giving proteins with a non-native and non-consensus c-terminus , to test  <dig> putative interactions. of these, we could test  <dig> interactions  detected by y2h were reproduced in these tests, including 12/ <dig> cases where the y2h interaction had originally been found only in the cdna screen using constructs with a native c-terminus . we thus confirmed many interactions between pdz domains and proteins with a non-native and/or non-consensus c-terminus. to investigate further the possibility that these pdz domains were interacting with an internal sequence in the partner protein, we returned to a set of high-confidence interactions found in the cdna screen. for  <dig> proteins  that did not possess a canonical consensus c-terminal, we cloned derivatives corresponding to the entire protein less the  <dig> last residues, or when possible the experimentally defined minimal interacting region , also without the  <dig> c-terminal residues. this was to ensure that observed interaction did not depend on the native c-terminal residues. using co-ip, we found that 52/ <dig> interactions  successfully tested could be reproduced in the co-ip system even in the majority of cases when removal of the terminal residues did not create a new consensus binding site . we are therefore confident that the dataset that we provide will be a useful source of information to direct studies of pdz-domain signaling pathways.

a y2h array as a tool to probe pdz domain binding
many true interactions protein-protein interactions are missed in y2h library screens. this high rate of false negatives can be partially alleviated by performing directed y2h assays  <cit> . we therefore decided to construct a y2h interaction array that would allow candidate proteins to be screened for their binding capacity to the comprehensive set of pdz domains. for this, we took a collection of yeast strain each expressing a single pdz-domain from an y2h ad-vector, and spotted them in a standard  <dig> ×  <dig> format on a solid agar support. the individual domains on the array can be probed by introducing into each strain a vector allowing the expression of a protein of interest, using a standard y2h approach. to test the utility of the resource, we first conducted parallel matings with a yeast strain expressing nrx- <dig>  the c. elegans ortholog of vertebrate neurexin, which plays a critical role in synaptic development . consistent with the results of our y2h screen that had identified nrx- <dig> as an interactor of syd- <dig>  we found syd- <dig> as a partner for nrx- <dig> using the array. syd- <dig> is also a regulator of synaptogenesis. we also identified an additional  <dig> binding partners, including the single pdz domain containing stn- <dig>  a gamma syntrophin, and mpz- <dig> that can be found at synapses. mpz- <dig> has  <dig> pdz domains and we detected an interaction only with the 9th domain. we also screened the array with let- <dig> and identified  <dig> proteins, including its known partner lin- <dig>  <cit>  . on the other hand, when we screened the array with pac- <dig>  we found par- <dig>  which has been demonstrated to be its physiological functional partner  <cit>  . similarly, the sole interactor identified for pry- <dig>  a negative regulator of wnt signaling, was mig- <dig>  one of three c. elegans dishevelled homologs that functions in both canonical and non-canonical wnt signaling pathways . neither of the other  <dig> dishevelled homologs were detected as interacting with pry- <dig>  consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

discussion
we constructed a comprehensive, proteome-wide interaction map for all the pdz domains from c. elegans. importantly, for a substantial proportion of the interactions, we were able to obtain independent biochemical confirmation. the interactions we characterized covered a broad range of putative biological functions, reflecting the ubiquitous involvement of pdz-domain proteins in cellular physiology. although a number of pdz-domain proteins have been functionally characterized in great details, in very few cases has a role for an individual pdz-domain been identified. we did find a small group of interactions involving pdz-domains protein for which there was prior experimental evidence, such as those involving let- <dig> and lin- <dig>  and par- <dig> and pkc- <dig>  <cit> . further, we were able to provide a molecular basis for certain previously characterized genetic interactions . there were many additional interactions that could merit directed study, such as that between pten/daf- <dig> and dishevelled/dsh- <dig>  two proteins that function respectively in the pten/akt and wnt pathway, and the multipartite interaction between lin- <dig> and csc- <dig>  and lin- <dig> with csc- <dig> and icp- <dig>  the lin-2/lin-7/lin- <dig> complex is known for its role in basolateral targeting of the let- <dig> receptor. csc- <dig> and icp- <dig> are orthologs of borealin and incenp two components of the vertebrate chromosomal passenger complex . we confirmed csc-1's interactions and the interactions between the two pdz domains of lin- <dig> with icp- <dig> using a biochemical approach . this raises the possibility of an unsuspected functional link between these two protein complexes, and is a good example of the hypotheses that can be generated through global analyses.

as a last example, both via our global screen and using the pdz-domain array, we detected an interaction between mig- <dig> and pry- <dig>  previous studies had mapped the interaction between pry- <dig> and mig- <dig> to the n-terminal half of mig- <dig>  <cit> , which does contain the protein's single pdz domain. the c-terminus of pry- <dig>  does not contain a consensus pdz-binding motif. this therefore represents a clear example of a functionally validated protein-protein interaction that we have shown to involve a non-canonical pdz domain interaction. indeed, more than half of the interactions did not involve the previously defined pdz-domain binding c-terminal motifs. by aligning and analyzing our set of pdz-interacting proteins, we were unable to identify a clear internal motif that could be uniquely responsible for pdz domain binding. nevertheless, this global study clearly indicates that non-consensus binding is a much more frequent phenomenon than previously suspected. extensive future functional studies will be needed to validate all the individual internal pdz domains interactions described here, but it is important to note that in certain isolated cases, this unconventional mode of binding has been demonstrated  <cit> .

it is clear that global y2h screens only reveal a fraction of potential protein-protein interactions  <cit> . among other factors, this is due to cdna representation in non-normalized libraries. this was one motivation for generating an array that allows direct y2h assay of any protein or peptide of interest against a complete set of pdz domains. coupled with the collection of pdz domain sequences in the gateway entry vector, allowing facile transfer to vectors for rnai, or protein expression, the array, which is available as a community resource, will allow comprehensive functional analyses of all pdz domains in c. elegans.

CONCLUSIONS
by conducting a comprehensive, domain-centered interactome study, we have clearly illustrated at the genome scale the degree of promiscuity and discrimination that governs interactions between individual pdz domains and their protein partners. this approach also revealed that pdz domains frequently interact in a non-canonical fashion. this broadens our understanding of pdz domains and should guide future functional studies.
