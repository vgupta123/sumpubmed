BACKGROUND
atopic allergy and other forms of hypersensitivity reactions pose a major concern for public health, affecting up to 25% of the population in industrial nations  <cit> . with the rapid growth in the number of genetically modified  food, biopharmaceuticals and other biotechnology-derived products, identifying potential allergenicity in proteins has become crucial in product safety assessment  <cit> .

unlike laboratory-based allergenicity assessment methods such as the skin prick test and rast , which are often rigorous and time-consuming, the use of bioinformatics tools has come in favorably for accelerating the discovery of novel allergens. guidelines to evaluate allergenicity potential of proteins have been jointly proposed by the food and agriculture organization /world health organization  expert consultation on allergenicity of foods derived from biotechnology  <cit> . according to the bioinformatics section of the guidelines, a protein is a potential allergen if it either has an identity of ≥  <dig> continuous amino acids or ≥ 35% sequence similarity over a window of  <dig> amino acids with a known allergen.

although useful in some cases, it has been shown that the fao/who joint recommendation produces a large number of false positives, resulting in specificities that are too low to be of practical use  <cit> . to address these drawbacks, more sophisticated bioinformatics tools have been developed. these include support vector machines   <cit> , gaussian classification algorithms  <cit> , wavelet transform models  <cit> , allergen motifs  <cit> , ige sequence comparisons  <cit>  and the use of allergen-representative peptides   <cit> . while these systems are effective for high similarity allergen sequences, they are less effective for when the overall similarity is low  <cit> .

position-specific scoring matrices  have been very successful for detecting distantly related protein sequences  <cit> , but have yet been applied for assessing allergenic potentials in proteins. in this study, we shall examine the feasibility of using pssm as a basis for developing an effective allergenicity prediction system. as will be seen below, the use of an iterative psi-blast in combination with various filters for accuracy optimization shows great promise for constructing general and group-specific profiles suitable for allergenicity assessment.

RESULTS
the performance of both profile-based approaches was evaluated using eight different e-value thresholds . we consider values of sp ≥ 80% and se ≥ 80% useful in practice  <cit>  and assessed suitability of both methods using the above cutoffs.

general profile model
the predictive performance of the general allergen profile approach is in accordance with expected allergenic patterns in proteins and provided an accuracy  of greater than 85%  for e-value cutoffs of ≤ 10- <dig>  this approach is shown to perform best at the e-value threshold of 10- <dig> . at this threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of the model is  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.

group-specific profile model
allergen sequences are currently classified into  <dig> major groups by the iuis allergen nomenclature sub-committee  – i) weeds, ii) fungi, iii) grasses, iv) trees, v) mites, vi) animals, vii) insects, viii) food, and ix) others  <cit> . we constructed group-specific profiles based on all  <dig> major allergen groups, and tested their capability in predicting allergen sequences. as illustrated in table  <dig>  the approach achieved similar performance as the general profile model, and can predict allergens with high accuracy  at e-value thresholds of ≤ 10- <dig>  the best performance is observed at the e-value threshold of 10- <dig> . at this threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of the model is  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.

next, we tested the ability of group-specific profiles in identifying allergens that belong to their respective group category . among the  <dig> group-specific profile models,  <dig> are capable of predicting allergens with accuracy greater than 80%. mite profile model achieved the best performance with an accuracy of  <dig> % , followed by grass profile model , and insect profile model . the poorest performance was observed for food model . this may be attributable to the fact that food allergens contain highly diverse protein sequences that do not share much common features and sequence patterns.

comparison with existing methods
to benchmark the performance of the profile-based prediction methods, the five testing datasets, each consisting of  <dig> allergen sequences and  <dig> non-allergen sequences, was used to evaluate six available techniques – the fao/who evaluation scheme  <cit> , svm global description approach  <cit> , svm amino acid composition approach  <cit> , svm dipeptide composition approach  <cit> , meme motif discovery tool  <cit>  and arp technique  <cit> . the overall performance of each technique is indicated by the average performance over the five datasets.

as illustrated in table  <dig>  the overall performance of both general and group-specific profile-based models outperforms all other existing prediction systems investigated in this study. both svm amino acid and dipeptide composition methods  <cit>  and the arp technique  <cit>  achieved high sensitivity  but low specificity  was also observed. the svm global description approach  <cit>  achieved the closest performance to the profile-based models in terms of accuracy . however, it exhibits high specificity  but low prediction sensitivity . the meme motif discovery approach is shown to produce the lowest sensitivity , which is lower than the reported sensitivity of 7%   <cit> . this may be due to several reasons: i) differences in the testing dataset; and ii) the derived meme motifs did not manage to capture essential features in allergen sequences. in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , the fao/who evaluation scheme predicts allergens with low specificity  and low accuracy . in contrast to pssm, the fao/who similarity-based evaluation scheme incorrectly predicts a large proportion of proteins derived from bacteria , viruses  and yeasts  as positives. it is possible that some of these proteins may contain ig-binding epitopes, though not necessarily demonstrate ige binding. among the false negatives, majority are distant homologues derived from fungi , food  and insect .

CONCLUSIONS
it is shown that profile-based methods are highly promising for assessing potential allergenicity and cross-reactivity in proteins with sensitivities and specificities of over 80%. the strength of such models lies in its ability to detect distantly related protein homologues through the use of iterated profiles  <cit> . to date, the exact mechanisms of allergy remains unclear as the structural, functional or biochemical properties of allergens that leads to allergic responses have yet to be elucidated. the allergen profiles that are constructed in this study may also be used as a basis for identifying common amino acid residues or physicochemical properties that support allergenicity  <cit> .
