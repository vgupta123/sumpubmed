BACKGROUND
sporothrix schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that produces lymphocutaneous lesions in humans and animals. it is the etiologic agent of sporotrichosis, a subcutaneous lymphatic mycosis with a worldwide distribution  <cit> . in its saprophytic form it develops hyaline, regularly septated hyphae and pyriform conidia which can be found single or in groups in a characteristic daisy-like arrangement. the yeast or parasitic form shows ovoid cells with single or multiple budding.

in s. schenckii, dimorphism is both a proliferative and morphogenetic process. we have reported that in response to different environmental stimuli, s. schenckii unbudded synchronized yeast cells, either proliferate  or engage in a developmental program that includes proliferation accompanied by morphogenesis . dimorphism in s. schenckii, depends on transmembrane signalling pathways that respond to cell density  <cit> , external ph  <cit> , cyclic nucleotides  <cit>  and extracellular calcium concentration  <cit> .

dimorphism is an adaptation response to changing environmental conditions. the morphology displayed by dimorphic fungi is probably the result of the stimulation of membrane receptors by extracellular ligands. heterotrimeric  guanine nucleotide binding proteins have been associated with membrane receptors and with morphogenetic transition signalling in many eukaryotes, and play a crucial role in fungal morphogenesis as well  <cit> . they constitute a family of gtp hydrolases involved in signal transduction pathways. these proteins are coupled to membrane receptors  that recognize different extracellular signals. the α subunits of the heterotrimeric g proteins bind gtp. the interaction of a ligand with the gprc initiates the exchange of bound gdp for gtp in the gα subunit resulting in the dissociation of the heterotrimer into α-gtp and βγ subunits. the dissociated α-gtp subunit and the βγ dimer, relay signals to different targets resulting in changes in cytoplasmic ionic composition or in second messenger levels  that ultimately lead to a cellular response  <cit> .

genes encoding proteins that are similar to the gα class of the heterotrimeric g proteins have been described in filamentous fungi such as aspergillus nidulans  <cit>  and neurospora crassa  <cit> , as well as in fungal plant pathogens like cryphonectria parasitica  <cit> , ustilago maydis  <cit>  and magnaporthe grisea  <cit> , among others. in s. schenckii, a  <dig> kda gα subunit homologous to the gαi subunit and sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin was described previously by us  <cit> . this was the first gαi subunit described in a pathogenic dimorphic fungus.

in higher eukaryotes, members of the gα class are known to regulate adenylate cyclase  <cit> , cgmp phosphodiesterase  <cit> , phosphoinositide-3-kinase  <cit> , calcium and potassium channels  <cit> , and the activity of phospholipases  <cit> . in fungi, gα subunits have been shown to regulate adenylate cyclase, morphogenesis and pathogenicity  <cit> . most of the studies related to determining the role of the heterotrimeric g protein subunits in fungi involved the observation of the morphological effects produced in the fungus when these genes are deleted  <cit> . nevertheless, the full scope of the processes that gα subunits regulate in fungi is still not known and interactions between these subunits and cellular proteins have seldom been reported in pathogenic fungi.

a large number of g protein coupled receptors have been observed to induce activation of phospholipase a <dig> in higher eukaryotic systems  <cit> . the pla <dig> superfamily can be classified according to cellular location or biological properties  <cit> . the phospholipase a superfamily includes the calcium dependent-secretory pla <dig> , the calcium independent-intracellular pla <dig>  and the cytosolic pla <dig> . they differ in terms of calcium requirements, substrate specificity, molecular weight and lipid modification. the spla <dig> is usually a  <dig> to  <dig> kda protein while the cpla <dig> is a  <dig> kda protein in human macrophages. the cpla <dig> possesses characteristics that suggest that it is associated to receptor-activated signal transduction cascades  <cit> . this pla <dig> is known to translocate to the membrane in response to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration  <cit> . cytosolic pla <dig> hydrolyses the sn- <dig> position of phospholipids, resulting in the release of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. the most commonly released fatty acid is arachidonic acid, which in turn is converted to eicosanoids that regulate multiple processes including calcium channels, mitogenic signals and most important, the inflammatory response of macrophages  <cit> .

the present study was undertaken to identify the presence of and characterize additional gα subunits in s. schenckii, to identify any important interacting partners of the new gα subunit, and finally to determine the involvement if any of the interacting protein, in this case cpla <dig>  in the control of dimorphism in this fungus. here we give details of the identification and sequencing of the ssg- <dig> gene, including gene organization, the presence and position of introns, derived amino acid sequence and conserved polypeptide-encoded domains. using ssg- <dig> as bait, we identified a cpla <dig> homologue interacting with this g protein α subunit. we give the genomic sequence of this gene and the complete derived amino acid sequence. we also report the effects on the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle of phopholipase effectors in s. schenckii.

this work constitutes the first report of the presence of multiple g protein α subunits in s. schenckii, the presence of a cpla <dig> homologue interacting with this g protein α subunit, and the involvement of cpla <dig> in the control of dimorphism in s. schenckii. in addition to being a very important determinant of pathogenicity in fungi and other organisms, cpla <dig> is shown to have a direct effect in the control of dimorphism in this fungus. this information will ultimately help us construct the signal transduction pathway leading from the g proteins onward and the role of g proteins and its interacting partners in fungal pathogenesis.

RESULTS
identification of the ssg- <dig> gene
most fungal gα subunit genes vary only slightly in size within the region encoding the gesgkst and kwihcf motifs where primers for pcr are usually made because of the conserved nature of these regions. in the region comprised between these primers size variations are usually due to the presence of introns of slightly different sizes. two pcr products were obtained when using fungal dna as template and the gesgkst/kwihcf primer pair one belonging to ssg- <dig> and the other to ssg- <dig> of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. the ssg- <dig> pcr product  established the presence of a new gene encoding another gα subunit in s. schenckii. figure 1a shows the sequencing strategy used for the identification of this new g protein α subunit gene. once the coding sequence was completed, it was confirmed using yeast cdna as template and the mgacms/kdsgil primer pair. a  <dig>  bp orf was obtained, containing the coding region of the ssg- <dig> cdna as shown in figure 1b. using the same primer pair and genomic dna as template a  <dig>  bp pcr product was obtained. sequencing of this pcr product confirmed the sequences obtained previously and showed the presence and position of  <dig> introns. these introns had the consensus gt/ag junction splice site and interrupted the respective codons after the second nucleotide. the first intron interrupted the codon for g <dig> and consisted of  <dig> bp, the second intron interrupted the codon for y <dig> and consisted of  <dig> bp, the third intron interrupted the codon for h <dig> and consisted of  <dig> bp, the fourth intron starts interrupted the codon h <dig> and consisted of  <dig> bp. with the exception of the regions where introns were present in the genomic sequence of the ssg- <dig> gene, the cdna sequence and genomic sequence were identical. the overlapping of these two sequences confirmed the presence of the introns in the genomic sequence. the cdna and genomic sequence of ssg- <dig> have genbank accession numbers af <dig> and ay <dig>  respectively.

bioinformatic characterization of ssg-2
the derived amino acid sequence  revealed a gα subunit of  <dig> amino acids as shown in figure 1b. the calculated molecular weight of the ssg- <dig> gene product was  <dig>  kda. blocks analysis of the amino acid sequence of ssg- <dig> revealed a g-protein alpha subunit signature from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> with an e value of  <dig> e- <dig> and a fungal g-protein alpha subunit signature from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> with an e value of  <dig> e- <dig>  <cit> . ssg- <dig> has the motifs encoding the gtpase domain  <cit>  with the corresponding consensus sequences involved in gtp binding shaded in gray in figure 1b. the phosphate binding loop which includes the sequence gxgxxgks is found in ssg- <dig> as gsgesgks. the magnesium binding residues with the consensus sequence dxxg is present as dvgg in ssg- <dig>  while the guanine ring binding sites are those with the consensus sequence nkxd is present as nkvd. the txat consensus sequence is present as tqat in ssg- <dig>  another region involved in phosphate binding includes the consensus sequence rxxt that in ssg- <dig> is present as rtkt. in addition to these conserved domains, the protein derived from the ssg- <dig> cdna sequence has the n-terminal glycine that is myristoylated in gα subtypes and is needed for membrane association. the  <dig> residues that identify the adenylate cyclase interaction site according to blast analysis  <cit>  are in red in figure  <dig>  these include i <dig>  k <dig>  i <dig>  h <dig>  and e  <dig>  the putative receptor binding site includes amino acids l <dig> to r <dig> and is shown in blue letters in figure  <dig> <cit> .

the derived amino acid sequence alignment of ssg- <dig> to that of the several fungal homologues is shown in figure  <dig>  this figure shows more than 85% identity to maga of m. grisea  <cit> , cpg- <dig> of c. parasitica  <cit>  and gna- <dig> of n. crassa  <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes the percent identity of ssg- <dig> to some members of the fungal gα homologues and ssg- <dig> 

ssg- <dig> is included as reference. analysis was carried out using iprotclass database and the blast algorithm. overlap refers to the number of residues used to determine ssg-2% identity when doing pairwise comparisons.

yeast two-hybrid screening
two independent yeast two-hybrid screenings, using different s. schenckii yeast cells cdna libraries were done with the complete coding sequence of ssg- <dig> as bait. in both screenings,  <dig> blue colonies growing in quadruple drop out  medium  were identified as containing the same pla <dig> homologue insert. the expression of the ade+, his+ phenotypes and α galactosidase activity are considered by the manufacturer as corroborative of true interactions. the inserts from all three colonies were found to contain the carboxy-terminal residues of a protein homologous to pla2's from a. nidulans. our results indicated that the last  <dig> amino acids of the s. schenckii cpla <dig> homologue interacted with ssg- <dig> 

co-immunoprecipitation 
the ssg-2-sspla <dig> interaction was corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation. figure  <dig> shows the confirmation of the interaction observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay between ssg- <dig> and sspla <dig> by co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-cmyc antibody that recognizes ssg- <dig>  this band is of the expected size  considering that ssg- <dig> was expressed fused to the gal- <dig> binding domain. the two high molecular weight bands present belong to the anti-cmyc antibodies used for precipitation. lane  <dig> shows the results obtained in the western blot when the primary anti-cmyc antibody was not added . lane  <dig> shows the band obtained using anti-ha antibody that recognizes the original sspla <dig> fragment isolated from the yeast two-hybrid clone. this band is of the expected size  considering that only the last  <dig> amino acids of the protein were present and that this fragment was fused to the gal- <dig> activation domain. lane  <dig> shows the results obtained in the western blot when the primary anti-ha antibody was not added .

sequencing of the sspla <dig> gene
bioinformatic characterization of sspla2
the panther classification system identified this protein as a member of the cytosolic phospholipase a <dig> family   with an extremely significant e value of  <dig>  e- <dig>  <cit> . blast analysis of the derived amino acid sequence of the s. schenckii sspla <dig>  showed a phospholipase domain extending from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . pfam analysis shows similar results, and in this domain the pla <dig> signature gxsg   is present as gvsgs in the active site   <cit> . the amino acids needed for catalytic activity r <dig>  s <dig> and d <dig> are given in red in this same figure  <cit> . s <dig> is essential for the formation of arachidonyl serine needed for the transfer of the arachidonyl group to glycerol or to water. the amino acids d <dig> to l <dig>  d <dig> to g <dig> and d <dig> to a <dig>  comprise putative ef hand domains of the protein . in figure 4b a putative calmodulin binding domain was identified from amino acids q <dig> to l <dig> using the calmodulin target database  <cit>  and highlighted in gray. a serine protease, subtilase family, aspartic acid active site motif was identified using scan prosite with an e value of  <dig> e- <dig> from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> and is shaded in blue green in figure 4b <cit> . this motif is characteristic of both yeast and fungal cpla <dig> homologues  <cit> .

effects of pla <dig> effectors on the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle
s. schenckii is not a genetically manageable organism, therefore, effectors of pla <dig> were tested for their effects on the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle. arachidonic acid is the primary product of cpla <dig> activity on phospholipids, while aacocf <dig> and isotetrandrine are inhibitors of pla <dig> activity. aacocf <dig> is a known competitive inhibitor of pla <dig>  <cit> . it is an analogue of arachidonic acid and presumably binds directly to the active site of the enzyme. it is a potent and selective inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase a  <cit> . isotetrandrine on the other hand is an alkaloid that has been reported to interfere with g protein activation of pla <dig>  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the percentage of yeast cells forming germ tubes in the presence and absence of arachidonic acid, aacocf <dig> and isotetrandrine. this figure shows that these latter compounds significantly stimulated the yeast to mycelium transition at  <dig> and  <dig> h of incubation when the control cells are in the process of dna synthesis and germ tube emergence  <cit> . the percent stimulation was approximately 68% and 33% at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of incubation in the presence of both aacocf <dig> and isotetrandrine. in the presence of arachidonic acid a slight  non-significant inhibition was observed at  <dig> h of incubation. the degree of stimulation caused by the addition of aacocf <dig> and isotetrandrine was similar even though the mechanism of action of these compounds is completely different.

discussion
the heterotrimeric g protein family ranks among the most important protein families identified as intracellular recipients of external signalling. the present study was conducted in order to describe new gα subunit encoding genes in s. schenckii, identify any important protein interacting with this g alpha subunit and determine the effects on dimorphism in s. schenckii of the protein or proteins identified.

the results presented here, together with our previous report  <cit>  corroborate the existence of more than one heterotrimeric g protein α subunit gene in s. schenckii. unpublished results indicate that this protein is one of at least  <dig> gα subunits present in s. schenckii. in this sense, s. schenckii is behaving more like the filamentous fungi and plant pathogens such as n. crassa  <cit> , c. parasitica  <cit>  and m. grisea  <cit> , where genes that encode  <dig> different gα subunits similar to the gα class of animals rather than to the gpa group present in yeasts and plants. computational sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the gα subunits in filamentous fungi shows the existence of  <dig> distinct subfamilies of g protein alpha subunits  <cit> . according to the classification offered by li and collaborators, ssg- <dig> belongs to group iii of the fungal g protein alpha subunits  <cit> . the group iii considered by them to be gαs analogues because they positively influence camp levels although they have more sequence similarity to gαi  <cit> .

the nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis of this new g protein α subunit gene are different from the previously identified ssg- <dig> gene. the nucleotide conservation of the coding region of ssg- <dig> is less than 50% when compared to that of the previously reported ssg- <dig> gene, confirming that ssg- <dig> and ssg- <dig> are two different genes . the derived amino acid sequence of ssg- <dig> is 50% identical to that of ssg- <dig>  but they have differences in the motifs that are characteristic of the g protein alpha subunits, the most important difference being that ssg- <dig> lacks the cysteine residue in domain  <dig> that characterizes the pertussis binding domain of ssg- <dig> . for this reason, ssg- <dig> belongs to the gα class but cannot be strictly considered a gαi, even though it is 46% identical to mammalian gαi class members. this shows the high degree of conservation in gα subunits even among phylogenetically distant organisms.

the work done in order to identify the role of gα subunits in the filamentous fungi has been mainly concerned with the phenotypes observed when these genes are knocked-out . in this paper a different approach was used. we wanted to identify important protein-protein interactions between ssg- <dig> and the complex signalling system that regulates the flow of information from the environment through the heterotrimeric g proteins into the cell in s. schenckii. using the yeast two-hybrid technique we identified a cpla <dig> homologue as interacting with ssg- <dig> in two independent experiments, using two different cdna libraries. this ssg-2-pla <dig> interaction was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. up to date, protein-protein interactions of these gα subunits have not been reported in the pathogenic fungi, and the exact proteins with which these gα subunits interact have not been identified. this is the first report of a cytosolic pla <dig> homologue interacting with a g protein α subunit in a pathogenic dimorphic fungus, suggesting a functional relationship between these two important proteins. other proteins interact with ssg- <dig> , but the ssg-2-pla <dig> interaction is very important as it connects this g protein α subunit with both pathogenicity and lipid signal transduction in fungi  <cit> .

this pla <dig> homologue belongs to the group iv pla <dig> family that has been highly conserved throughout evolution. blast searches of the amino acid sequence of sspla <dig> against the homo sapiens database shows that it is phylogenetically related to the human group iva pla <dig> family. this same analysis using the fungal databases revealed that sspla <dig> is more closely related to the phospholipases of the filamentous fungi than to plab of yeasts. the similarity to both human and fungal phospholipases is found primarily in the catalytic domain with a great deal of variation contained in the first and last  <dig> amino acids. in the catalytic domain we find an important difference between sspla <dig> and the human homologues. the former has one continuous catalytic domain, rather than the more typical cpla <dig> structure where two homologous catalytic domains are present, interspaced with unique sequences  <cit> .

sspla <dig> lacks the c <dig> motif found in cpla <dig> of higher eukaryotes. this domain is involved in the translocation of the enzyme to the membrane in response to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration  <cit> . nevertheless, sspla <dig> has  <dig> putative ef hand motifs suggesting that it could also be calcium modulated. ef hand motifs are also present in the pla <dig> homologues of m. grisea, g. zeae, n. crassa and a. nidulans in different areas of these proteins. it is interesting to note that a. nidulans pla <dig> has been reported to be responsive to calcium even though it also lacks a c <dig> domain  <cit> .

also contributing to the possible modulation by calcium of this protein is the presence of a putative calmodulin binding domain  <cit> . as in the case of the ef hand-motifs, analysis of the pla <dig> homologues of m. grisea, n. crassa, g. zeae and in a. nidulans show the presence of possible calmodulin binding domains in different areas of the proteins  <cit> . in s. schenckii the putative calmodulin binding domain is at the c terminal end of the protein, while in m. grisea, n. crassa and g. zeae it is within the first  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids.

in addition to the identification of pla <dig> as interacting with ssg- <dig>  we inquired as to the effects of pla <dig> in s. schenckii dimorphism. as mentioned previously, pla <dig> hydrolyses the sn- <dig> position of phospholipids, resulting in the release of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. the most commonly released fatty acid is arachidonic acid. we tested the effects of exogenously added arachidonic acid on the kinetics of germ tube formation or the yeast cell cycle in s. schenckii. our results show that exogenously added arachidonic acid had no significant effect on the kinetics of the yeast to mycelium transition, but a significant stimulation  in the percentage of budding in cells induced to re-enter the yeast cell cycle was observed at  <dig> h of incubation in the presence of this compound. the observed stimulation of the yeast cell cycle by arachidonic acid is consistent with the inhibitory effects on this same cycle observed in the presence of aacocf <dig> and isotetrandrine in s. schenckii, inhibitors of pla <dig>  these inhibitors have different mechanisms of action as stated previously. aacocf <dig> is a competitive inhibitor of pla <dig>  <cit>  and an analogue of arachidonic acid, while isotetrandrine interferes with g protein activation of pla <dig>  <cit> . both aacocf <dig> and isotetrandrine increased significantly the percentage of cells with germ tubes at  <dig> and  <dig> h after inoculation and decreased budding in cells induced to re-enter the yeast cycle. the aacocf <dig> results are consistent with our hypothesis that pla <dig> activity is needed for the yeast cell cycle in s. schenckii, specifically at the start of dna synthesis  <cit> . furthermore, the isotetrandine results support the hypothesis that the interaction of ssg- <dig> with pla <dig> is required for these processes to occur.

it is of interest to note that we recently reported similar results in the presence of calmodulin inhibitor w <dig> and inhibitors of calcium-calmodulin kinase in s. schenckii  <cit> . inhibiting calmodulin or calmodulin-dependent kinase also inhibited the re-entry of yeast cells into the cell cycle. we can speculate that by inhibiting the calmodulin dependent kinase we are also inhibiting the migration of cpla <dig> to the membrane and/or its activation.

we cannot fully ascertain the functional consequences of the observed interaction between pla <dig> and ssg- <dig> at this time. future work will help us clarify this relationship. nevertheless, two important processes that have a bearing in cell cycle progression have been identified as subjected to cpla <dig> activity in other systems: 1) the production of biologically active molecules and 2) membrane remodeling  <cit> .

there is very little information regarding the effects of the primary metabolites released from the action of pla <dig>  in fungi, arachidonic acid was reported to stimulate adenylate cyclase  <cit>  in s. cerevisiae. if this is also true for s. schenckii, addition of arachidonic acid to the medium would be expected to stimulate the yeast cell cycle and this was what we observed. we had previously reported that dibutyryl derivatives of camp inhibit the yeast to mycelium transition in s. schenckii  <cit> .

on the other hand, membrane remodeling is also an important function of enzymes such as phospholipases. this process is needed for cell cycle progression and fungal morphogenesis  <cit> . it has been reported in other systems that in order for the cell cycle to occur there must be a careful balance between membrane phospholipid synthesis and degradation. pla <dig> has an important role in the maintenance of this balance  <cit> . the lipid composition of the membrane is also essential for the correct receptor-protein interactions and plays an important role in signal transduction. g proteins are usually in molar excess when compared to the gprc's and a large number of inactive gdp-bound heterotrimeric g protein molecules must be available in receptor-rich domains associated to membrane lipids  <cit> .

g proteins can also affect pla <dig> activity by a number of different mechanisms such as: increasing the intracellular calcium concentration, transcriptional regulation and stimulation of phosphorylation through different protein kinases such as protein kinase c and map kinases .

the studies presented here constitute the first evidence of the interaction of g protein subunits of fungi with a phospholipase. these results establish for the first time a relationship between g proteins and the pathogenic determinants of fungi. the identification of such an important protein as partners of a g protein alpha subunit in fungi suggests a mechanism by which these g proteins can control pathogenicity in fungi. the existence of the interaction reported here may offer an explanation as to why fungi with decreased g protein alpha subunits such as c. parasitica, hypovirus infection  <cit>  and m. grisea with disrupted gα subunit gene, magb, exhibit reduced levels of virulence  <cit> . this information is essential if we are to understand the disease producing process of fungi. it will also help elucidate the signal transduction pathway leading from the g protein onward and will give us a better insight into signal transduction in pathogenesis and dimorphism in s. schenckii.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown the presence of a new g protein α subunit in s. schenckii, ssg- <dig>  the cdna sequence of the ssg- <dig> gene encoded a  <dig> amino acid gα subunit of  <dig>  kda containing the  <dig> consensus domains present in all gα subunits. the genomic sequence has four introns, whose positions are conserved in the other fungal homologues of this gene.

yeast two-hybrid analysis using the complete amino acid sequence of ssg- <dig> identified a pla <dig> homologue as an interacting partner of this g protein subunit. this  <dig> amino acid protein was encoded by an intronless gene. the  <dig>  kda protein encoded by this gene contained all the domains and amino acid residues that characterize cytosolic phospholipase a <dig> 

pla <dig> and other phospholipases in fungi have very diverse roles not only as virulence factors but also in membrane homeostasis and signal transduction. inhibitor studies showed that this pla <dig> homologue and its interaction with ssg- <dig> were necessary for the re-entry of s. schenckii yeast cells into the budding cycle suggesting a role for this important virulence factor in the control of dimorphism in this fungus and for the expression of the yeast form. the effects of pla <dig> on the yeast cell cycle could be viewed as resulting from the generation of lipid messenger molecules or from membrane remodelling that affects the g1->s transition and g protein activity.

the relationship reported here between these two proteins, ssg- <dig> and sspla <dig>  constitutes the first report of the interaction of a fungal phospholipase and a g protein subunit and the possible involvement of g protein in fungal virulence and morphogenesis.
