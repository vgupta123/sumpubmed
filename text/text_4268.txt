BACKGROUND
molecular phylogenetic analyses have suggested that extant sauropsids  are divided into two major groups, the lineage of testudines  and archosauria  and the lineage of lepidosauria  although phylogenetic position of testudines is still debatable  <cit> . the divergence time between the two lineages has been estimated at around  <dig> million years  <cit> . most sauropsidan species have karyotypes consisting of macrochromosomes and microchromosomes, as for birds  <cit> , except for crocodilian species, whose karyotypes contain no microchromosomes  <cit> .

whole genome sequencing of chicken revealed that the overall gc-content of chromosomes increases as chromosomal size decreases, that is, microchromosomes exhibit a higher gc-content than macrochromosomes  <cit> . in a compositional map of gc-content constructed by 100-kb window analysis for the chicken whole genome sequence, most microchromosomes were occupied by gc-rich dna segments, whereas gc-poor segments were more common in macrochromosomes  <cit> . the differences of other features such as gene density, distribution in interphase nuclei and rate of nucleotide divergence were also identified between the two chromosomal groups of birds  <cit> .

reptiles are crucial taxon for tracking genome evolution in amniotes  <cit> . intra-genomic gc heterogeneity has been found in reptiles by calculating gc-content in exonic third positions   <cit> . although the use of gc <dig> as a proxy for genomic gc-content has been controversial  <cit> , it is known that gc <dig> generally reflects the local gc-content of the introns and flanking regions of a gene  <cit> . chojnowski et al.  <cit>  analyzed the gc <dig> of more than  <dig>  ests in the american alligator  and suggested that the alligator genome has a certain level of gc heterogeneity. they also examined the isochore structure of the red-eared slider turtle  and suggested that the isochore structure of the turtle is intermediate between that of a frog and the gc-rich isochore structures of archosaurs and mammals  <cit> . however, the chromosomal distribution of the gc heterogeneity has not been fully investigated in reptiles.

we previously constructed a cytogenetic map with  <dig> cdna clones for the chinese soft-shelled turtle , which revealed that the chromosomes have been highly conserved between the turtle and chicken, with the six largest chromosomes being almost equivalent to each other  <cit> . gc <dig> of the mapped genes showed a heterogeneous distribution, and orthologs exhibited similar gc <dig> levels between the turtle, chicken and human, suggesting that the intra-genome gc heterogeneity had already occurred in the last common ancestor of extant amniotes  <cit> . furthermore, our results suggested that the turtle microchromosomes tend to contain more gc-rich genes than gc-poor genes, as in chicken  <cit> .

the green anole lizard  is the first reptilian species for which whole genomic sequence has been released  <cit> . anolis has a homogeneous genome composition compared with other amniotes  <cit>  and, unlike chicken, the gc-content is similar between macro- and microchromosomes  <cit> . however, it remains unknown whether these genomic characteristics are common to other lepidosaurs or not. snake karyotypes have been highly conserved within the group, and the usual diploid number is 2n =  <dig>  consisting of eight pairs of macrochromosomes and  <dig> pairs of microchromosomes  <cit> . the chromosome number is largely different from the chicken karyotype  because of the remarkable difference in the number of microchromosomes. the snake therefore provides an ideal system for exploring changes in gc-content between macro- and microchromosomes over the course of sauropsid evolution.

previously we constructed a cytogenetic map with  <dig> cdna clones for the japanese four-striped rat snake, elaphe quadrivirgata   <cit> . in this study, we have extended cdna-based chromosome mapping of the snake genes and consequently constructed a cytogenetic map with a total of  <dig> genes. we compared gc <dig> of the mapped snake genes with gc <dig> of their orthologs of chicken, green anole lizard, chinese soft-shelled turtle, human and xenopus tropicalis. this highlighted the chromosome size-dependent gc heterogeneity in the snake genome and the shift of gc-content possibly caused by chromosome rearrangements during sauropsid evolution.

methods
selection of est clones
a cytogenetic map with  <dig> cdna clones was constructed in our previous study  <cit> . in the present study, we searched the snake est clones isolated from the cdna library constructed from brain  <cit> , selected clones with significant similarity  to human and/or chicken genes in blastx  <cit> , and used them for chromosome mapping .

orthology assessment
we rigorously confirmed orthologies of the snake sequences to their homologs of other vertebrates by constructing molecular phylogenetic trees with the neighbor-joining method  <cit>  using xced in which the alignment algorithm mafft is implemented  <cit>  and with the maximum-likelihood method using phyml  <cit> . sequence ids of orthologs in six species  are included in additional file  <dig>  when multiple more than one potential ortholog was detected for a snake gene, we used the sequence with the greatest similarity to snake for cross-species comparison of gc-content.

chromosome preparation and fluorescence in situ hybridization
cell culture, preparation of r-banded chromosomes and fluorescence in situ hybridization  were performed as described previously  <cit> . fibroblast cells derived from lung tissues of the japanese four-striped rat snake were cultured and used for chromosome preparations. dna probes were labeled by nick translation with biotin-16-dutp . the hybridized cdna probes were reacted with goat anti-biotin antibodies , and then stained with alexa488-labeled donkey anti-goat igg .

calculation of gc-content
gc <dig> and gc-content at fourfold degenerate sites  were calculated using an original perl script with the bioperl module  <cit> . the calculation was automatically processed on the basis of the open reading frame identified by a pairwise alignment between a translated nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequences of orthologs using blastx  <cit> . when multiple alternative splicing variants were found for one gene, we used only the one that had the longest stretch of sequence homology with its orthologs of other species. we arbitrarily classified genes into gc-rich  and gc-poor  genes based on the gc <dig> 

identification of orthologous sequences in the burmese python
we conducted nucleotide blast for whole genome shotgun sequence of burmese python, python molurus bivittatus <cit>  using rat snake ests as queries. we selected python sequences  that exhibited high similarities for rat snake ests . we deduced the non-coding regions and the protein coding regions within each python genomic region using wise <dig> program  <cit> . we then calculated gc-content of non-coding regions and gc <dig> of coding regions.

gene location in sequenced genomes
chromosome locations of chicken, human and mouse orthologs were retrieved from ensembl   <cit>  and ncbi entrez gene  <cit> . in this study, we categorized chicken chromosomes 1– <dig>  z and w as macrochromosomes, and the remaining chromosomes as microchromosomes. recently the second version of the genome assembly and annotation of green anole lizard  was released in ensembl   <cit> . however, locations of about half of all a. carolinensis genes are at present annotated only at the scaffold level. we therefore did not compare the chromosome locations of orthologs between the snake and green anole lizard.

comparison of gene characteristics between chicken macrochromosomes and microchromosomes
we classified the chicken genes into two groups, macrochromosomal genes and microchromosomal genes, and examined the over- and under-representation of gene functions between the two groups by fatigo  <cit> . fatigo detects over-represented functional categories of gene ontology , kegg pathway, interpro motif and swissprot in either group between two gene lists using fisher’s exact test. the ensembl ids of all chicken genes whose chromosome locations are known were downloaded and used for comparison by fatigo.

RESULTS
cytogenetic map of the japanese four-striped rat snake
eighty-three cdna clones were newly mapped to the snake chromosomes, and finally a cytogenetic map with a total of  <dig> genes was constructed in this study . the nucleotide sequences of the newly mapped est clones were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers fs942043-fs <dig> 

of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were mapped to macrochromosomes , and the others were mapped to microchromosomes . twenty-nine segments in the snake chromosomes 1– <dig> and the z chromosome were conserved between the snake and chicken. most of them had a one to one correspondence to a particular region of chicken chromosomes. however, chromosomal homology for each of chicken chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was found on more than two snake macrochromosomes, indicating that some inter-chromosomal rearrangements occurred between the snake and chicken macrochromosomes .

chicken orthologs of  <dig> snake microchromosomal genes were located on chicken microchromosomes . pgk <dig>  atrx and stag <dig> genes on the snake microchromosomes are localized to the short arm of chicken chromosome  <dig>  which was derived from a microchromosome fused with acrocentric chromosome  <dig> of the avian ancestor  <cit> . since all the snake microchromosomes corresponded to avian microchromosomes, they have likely been retained from the ancestral karyotype of extant sauropsids without dynamic chromosome rearrangements.

linkage homologies with chicken microchromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  18– <dig> and 26– <dig> were found on the snake macrochromosomes . for example, chicken chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were homologous to the distal segments of the short and long arms of snake chromosome  <dig>  respectively. these results confirmed our previous assumption  <cit>  that the large differences of chromosome numbers between the snakes  and chicken  resulted from frequent chromosome rearrangements containing fusions between macro- and microchromosomes and also between microchromosomes in the lepidosaurian lineage. an alternative explanation is that fissions of macrochromosomes, which increase microchromosomes, may also have occurred in the lineage leading to birds.

intra-genomic heterogeneity of gc <dig> in snake
we calculated the gc <dig> for deduced protein-coding regions of the  <dig> snake genes . the average and standard deviation of gc <dig> of the snake genes were  <dig> % and  <dig> %  and a similar result was obtained when gc <dig> was analyzed . the averages of chicken, the soft-shelled turtle and human orthologs were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively . the average and standard deviation of gc <dig> of snake genes were thus somewhat smaller than those of the other amniotes. the distribution of gc <dig> of the snake genes was also relatively narrow . in order to examine bimodality of the distribution, we compared the fit of a “gaussian model” and “sum of two gaussians model” by extra sum-of-squares f test and akaike’s information criterion implemented in graphpad prism . as a result, “sum of two gaussians model” showed a better fit in both test . this suggests that gc <dig> of the snake genes exhibits a bimodal distribution.

gc <dig> was compared between macro-  and microchromosomal genes  to test for the presence of chromosome size-dependent gc <dig> heterogeneity in the snake genome . the average gc <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for macrochromosomal and microchromosomal genes, respectively. the average gc <dig> of microchromosomal genes was thus significantly higher than for macrochromosomal genes .  <dig> %  of the microchromosomal genes were gc-rich, whereas  <dig> %  of the macrochromosomal genes were gc-poor .

gc-rich isochores are known to have a clear association with r-bands  in mammals and birds  <cit> . in r-banded metaphases of rat snake, most microchromosomes showed r-positive bands . however, r-positive bands also observed on most macrochromosomal regions. thus, there was no clear correlation between r-band and gc <dig> of the mapped genes in rat snake.

correlation between gc <dig> and gc-content of non-coding regions in snakes
snake karyotypes are highly conserved among the species  <cit> , and the japanese four-striped rat snake  and the burmese python  have the same chromosome composition  <cit> . we compared the gc <dig> with the gc-content of non-coding regions in the python to examine whether snake gc <dig> reflects the local genomic gc-content . high positive correlation was found between gc <dig> and gc-content of non-coding regions  . in order to consider the differences of base composition among species  <cit> , we also compared gc <dig> of orthologs between the python and the rat snake  . strong correlation was found . these results suggest that the two species have similar genomic compositions and snake gc <dig> reflects the local genomic gc-content.

the gc-content of the python non-coding regions showed a narrow distribution with a low average  in contrast to gc <dig> . we divided the python non-coding regions into macrochromosomal  and microchromosomal regions  on the postulate that the chromosome locations of all orthologs were conserved between the rat snake and the python, and compared the gc-content between the two chromosomal groups . the average gc-content of microchromosomal regions  were significantly higher than those of macrochromosomal regions  .

cross-species comparison of gc <dig> between orthologs of amniotes
we examined the frequency distribution of gc <dig> of orthologs in green anole lizard, chicken, chinese soft-shelled turtle, human, mouse and an amphibian species x. tropicalis . in previous study, we analyzed the frequency distribution of gc <dig> with massive genes in these species except for anole lizard. the distribution patterns of gc <dig> of this study were similar to those in figure  <dig> of our previous study  <cit>  although the gene set of this study contains a somewhat higher proportion of gc-poor genes. thus we thought that gc <dig> of the gene set of this study could be used as a representative of gc <dig> of the whole genes in each species.

then, to examine whether orthologs exhibit similar levels of gc <dig> between species, we compared the gc <dig> of the snake genes with orthologs in other species . moderate positive correlations were found for snake-chicken , snake-turtle  and snake-human  comparisons with correlation coefficients r =  <dig>  . similarly, moderate positive correlations were found for chicken-human   and turtle-human  , respectively. much higher correlation was found for snake-anole lizard   and chicken-turtle  , respectively. in contrast, only weak correlation was found for snake-x. tropicalis  .

for the snake-chicken pair, we also compared the gc <dig> of orthologs with four categories: 1) genes located on macrochromosomes in both species , 2) genes located on microchromosomes in both species , 3) genes located on snake macrochromosomes and on chicken microchromosomes , and 4) genes located on snake microchromosomes and on chicken macrochromosomes  . four orthologs whose chromosome locations are unknown were excluded from this comparison. the average gc <dig> of the snake and chicken orthologs were  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in the 1st group,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in the 2nd group, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in the 3rd group, respectively . we were not able to compare the gc <dig> statistically in the 4th group because only three genes were classified into this group.

comparison of gene functions between macro- and microchromosomes
to examine the relationships between gene functions and chromosome size-dependent gc bias in chicken, we assessed over-representation of functional categories of gene ontology , kegg pathway, interpro motif and swissprot in either of two gene groups: the  <dig>  genes on chicken macrochromosomes  and  <dig>  genes on chicken microchromosomes . chromosomes 29– <dig> and 33– <dig> were excluded from analysis because of their absence from the assembled genome. no genes have been assigned to chromosome  <dig>  although the genome sequence was anchored to this chromosome. fourteen go terms or interpro domains were over-represented in either macrochromosomal genes or microchromosomal genes . over-representation of "chromatin" , "nucleosome"  and "chromosomal part"  on macrochromosomes largely depended on the abundance of members of the histone gene family on chromosome  <dig> . over-representation of "immunoglobulin c1-set"  and "mhc protein complex"  in microchromosomes came from clustering of many immune genes on chromosome  <dig> . similarly, over-representation of "keratin"  was due to the abundance of keratin-like gene family members on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . over-representation of the other eight categories in either macrochromosomes or microchromosomes was not attributable to an excess of genes on particular chromosomes .

discussion
chromosome size-dependent gc heterogeneity is a pan-sauropsida characteristic
we constructed a cytogenetic map of the japanese four-striped rat snake, which contained  <dig> genes. our cytogenetic map covered most macrochromosomal regions and at least one gene was mapped to each microchromosome on the basis of the homologies with chicken chromosomes. our map also showed linkage homologies with most chicken chromosomes, namely 1– <dig>  17– <dig>  24– <dig> and z. these results make it possible to infer the global gc heterogeneity of the snake genome and the shift of gc-content caused by chromosome rearrangements during sauropsid evolution.

we calculated gc <dig> to investigate the intra-genomic gc heterogeneity in the rat snake. the gc <dig> of the snake genes exhibited a bimodal distribution . such a bimodal distribution of gc <dig> was also observed in the genomes of the chinese soft-shelled turtle , chicken and non-rodent mammals  <cit> . this result suggests that the gc <dig> heterogeneity is a common feature of amniote genomes. however, the standard deviation of gc <dig> in snake genes was somewhat lower than that of other amniotes  <cit> , and gc-content of python non-coding regions also showed a narrow distribution, as observed in the green anole lizard  <cit> . thus the heterogeneities of base composition have probably decreased in lepidosaurian lineages over evolutionary time.

although the standard deviation of gc <dig> of snake genes was relatively small, our results suggest that snake microchromosomes contain a higher proportion of gc-rich genes than macrochromosomes, as observed in both the chinese soft-shelled turtle and chicken  <cit> . recently, chromosome size-dependent gc heterogeneity was also identified in the red-eared slider turtle  and the nile crocodile  using chromosome flow sorting technique  <cit> . chromosome size-dependent gc heterogeneity therefore seems to be a widespread characteristic in sauropsids whose karyotypes consist of macrochromosomes and microchromosomes, and possibly originated in the common ancestor of sauropsids. interestingly, the green anole lizard, whose karyotype consists of  <dig> pairs of macrochromosomes and  <dig> pairs of microchromosomes  <cit> , does not show such marked biases in gc-content between macro- and microchromosomes. this suggests that the chromosome size-dependent gc heterogeneity has disappeared in the lineage leading to the anole lizard. lepidosauria is a species-rich group consisting of about  <dig>  species, and the karyotypes are also diversified within the group. further investigation in various lepidosaurian species may help clarify the relationship between gc-content and the karyotype.

disparity between lepidosaurs and the turtle-archosaurs
the correlation coefficient of gc <dig> between the rat snake and chicken orthologs are lower than that between the chinese soft-shelled turtle and chicken . one explanation for the lower correlation is that the phylogenetic distance between the snake and chicken is larger than between the turtle and chicken. however, the divergence time between turtles and birds is estimated to be more than  <dig> million years, which is not largely different from the time of the lepidosauria-archosauria split,  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . therefore we consider the effect of the large differences of karyotypes, especially the number of microchromosomes, between the snake and the other two species.

the chromosome numbers are largely different between the rat snake  and chicken . in contrast, the karyotype of the chinese soft-shelled turtle, which consists of nine pairs of macrochromosomes and  <dig> pairs of microchromosomes , is very similar to the chicken karyotype  <cit> . our previous study demonstrated by comparative gene mapping that the chromosomes have been highly conserved between chicken and the turtle  <cit> . chicken microchromosomes were considered to extensively retain the ancestral linkage groups of genes  <cit> , and nakatani et al. <cit>  also suggested that many chicken microchromosomes  have one-to-one correspondence to ancestral proto-chromosomes of the gnathostome ancestor  <cit> . these results lead us to infer that chromosome rearrangements have occurred more frequently in the snake lineage than in the chicken lineage, that is, chromosome number has been reduced by frequent chromosome fusions between macro- and microchromosomes and also between microchromosomes in the snake lineage.

eleven chromosome segments homologous to chicken microchromosomes were localized to the snake macrochromosomes in this study . the gc <dig> of the snake orthologs on these macrochromosomal segments were lower than those of their chicken orthologs on microchromosomes . for instance,  <dig> of  <dig> snake orthologs mapped on chromosome 2q, which is homologous to chicken chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were gc-poor , whereas  <dig> of  <dig> chicken orthologs on chicken chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were gc-rich  . these results suggest that changes in chromosome sizes caused the differences of gc <dig> levels between the chicken microchromosomal genes and their snake orthologs on macrochromosomal segments derived from the ancestral microchromosomes .

impact of chromosome fissions/fusions on gc-content
what mechanisms were involved in the changes of the gc-content of the genes after the fusion of microchromosomes into macrochromosomal complement? it has been suggested that the gc-content is primarily influenced by local recombination rates via gc-biased gene conversion  <cit> . under this model, a or t is displaced by g or c through mismatch repair when an at/gc heteroduplex is formed at recombining regions. accordingly, at/gc heterozygotes produce more gc than at gametes, thus conferring predominance of gc alleles in frequently recombining regions.

recombination rate is negatively correlated with the size of chromosome arms in human and chicken  <cit> . in chicken in particular, recombination rate per unit physical length is much higher in microchromosomes than in macrochromosomes  <cit> . recombination rates per physical length are thus expected to be lower in the snake macrochromosomal segments derived from the ancestral microchromosomes than those in their homologous chicken microchromosomes. the chromosome size-dependent difference in the recombination rate thus seems to have caused the decrease of gc-content in the snake macrochromosomal genes derived from the microchromosomes of the common ancestor of sauropsids.

empirical evidence of chromosome length-driven evolution of gc-content has been shown in marsupial and monotreme species  <cit> . in contrast, chromosome size-dependent gc heterogeneity was not clearly demonstrated in eutherian species, likely because frequent chromosome rearrangements have obscured the history of gc-content changes  <cit> . in many eutherian lineages, however, intra-chromosomal gc heterogeneity has been reported  <cit> . in chicken, intra-chromosomal gc heterogeneity is not as prominent as in eutherians  <cit> , and there is no intra-chromosomal gc heterogeneity known in the anole genome  <cit> . our approach could not demonstrate whether there was intra-chromosomal gc heterogeneity in snake genome because of the insufficient sequence data provided by cdna sequencing. it is necessary to conduct whole genome sequencing and assemble the sequences into a chromosome scale in order to clarify the relationship between intra- and inter-chromosomal gc heterogeneity in the snake genomes.

when overall gc-content and recombination rates were compared among various vertebrate species, there was no clear correlation between gc-content and recombination rates  <cit> . for example, the recombination rate of chicken is about two times higher than that of zebra finch, although gc-content is almost equal between the two species  <cit> . whereas rat snake microchromosomal genes show similar level of gc <dig> to chicken microchromosomal genes, gc <dig> of rat snake macrochromosomal genes is significantly lower than chicken macrochromosomal genes . thus other factors might exert influences on overall genomic gc-content. in bacteria, genomic gc-content have been subject to natural selection but not to biased gene conversion  <cit> . modes other than biased gene conversion were also proposed for evolution of genome composition in vertebrates  <cit> . further consideration is therefore necessary for the evolution of overall genome composition in snakes.

any biological partitioning between macrochromosomes and microchromosomes?
many literatures reported existing correlations between gene function and base compositions of the genes, the genomes and the promoter regions  <cit> . the difference of global gc-content between the macro- and microchromosomes may potentially cause the biased distribution of gene functions between the chromosomes: some proteins containing more amino acids for gc-rich codons due to functional constraints may be more advantageous in being encoded in microchromosomes than in macrochromosomes. to test this possibility, we investigated functional difference between chicken macro- and microchromosomal genes on the basis of the frequencies of appearance of functional categories . over-representations found in six categories could be caused by clustering of particular gene families in short genomic stretches. these gene families may be less informative to test the hypothesis that genes are selected based on the size of chromosomes on which they are encoded. the over-representations of the other eight categories were independent from an excess of genes on particular chromosomes, implying that there could be some functional differences between macro- and microchromosomal genes.

in order to examine the relationship between the apparent localization of functional gene categories and the chromosome size-dependent gc-content, we investigated the gc-content of the gene sets assorted in the eight over-represented categories: go: <dig>  go: <dig>  go: <dig>  go: <dig>  ipr <dig>  go: <dig>  go: <dig> and go: <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 6: table s <dig>  seven of the eight categories were over-represented in microchromosomes. if most genes assorted in these go or interpro categories have high gc-content, it is likely that functional compartmentalization of genes is influenced by the difference of global gc-content between macro- and microchromosomes, i.e., some functionally categorized gene groups with high gc-content have been selectively preserved on microchromosomes. the average gc-content of the genes of the seven categories ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and most of them were lower than the average of all chicken genes  . in the other six categories , there was no clear correlation between abundance in macro- or microchromosomes and gc-content. for an example, go: <dig>  go: <dig> and go: <dig> were over-represented in macrochromosomes, but their gc-contents were relatively high . these results imply that functional differences of genes did not correlate with the global difference of gc-content between macro- and microchromosomes. further characterization of functional difference between macro- and microchromosomal genes, as well as its correlation with the general gc trend in chromosomal environments should await more extensive analyses using multiple species in future.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we constructed a cytogenetic map with  <dig> genes in the japanese four-striped rat snake, and calculated gc <dig> across all chromosomes. our results revealed cytogenetic evidence that snake microchromosomal genes tend to have higher gc <dig> than macrochromosomal genes, as found in the chicken and the chinese soft-shelled turtle, a feature apparently lost in the genome of anole lizard. by comparing gc <dig> of orthologs between snake and chicken, we show that the gc-content of genes is correlated with the size of chromosomes on which the genes are harbored. this chromosome size-dependent gc heterogeneity is particularly apparent in snake genes that have been translocated from microchromosomes to macrochromosomes since snakes and birds shared a common ancestor, some  <dig> million years. the addition of whole genome sequencing and karyotypes from wide variety of sauropsidan species will provide the fine-scale picture of timing and mode of gc shift accompanying karyotypic evolution in this important group of vertebrates.
