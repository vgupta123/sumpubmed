BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short  non-coding rna molecules, which influence gene expression mainly through degradation of coding mrna  <cit> . similar to protein coding genes, mirna genes  thus far identified are predominantly transcribed by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . new evidence, however, also indicates the involvement of rna polymerase iii for certain mirnas  <cit> . these findings suggest that pri-mirnas are regulated on the transcriptional level in a similar fashion as protein coding genes. following transcription, pri-mirnas are cleaved through the microprocessor complex drosha and dgcr <dig> to generate 60~70nt pre-mirnas  <cit> . exportin- <dig> and its co-factor rangtp then export the pre-mirnas into the cytoplasm  <cit> , where they are cleaved by dicer, an rnase iii endonuclease, to yield the mature mirnas  <cit> .

a wide range of mrnas are targeted by mirnas. numerous databases  <cit> , such as the tarbase database  <cit>  and mirtarbase  <cit> , hold experimentally validated or computationally predicted mirna targets. consequently, recent experimental and computational studies focus on the regulatory regions or transcription start sites  of mirna genes  <cit> , their associated transcription factors   <cit> , and their effects on mirna transcription  <cit> . nevertheless, the signals and mechanisms that govern mirna transcriptional regulation remain unclear.

interest in mirnas and their control is governed by the knowledge that a multitude of mirnas are implicated in a variety of human diseases  <cit> , including several human cancers  <cit> . recent studies and reviews focused on mirna involvement in the progression of the most serious gynaecological cancer, ovarian cancer , and it is now commonly accepted that mirnas play a role in oc  <cit> . experimental data shows that several mirnas exhibit altered expression levels in oc cell lines  <cit> . nevertheless, knowledge about possible mirna regulatory roles within oc initiation and progression is incomplete. the transcriptional regulation of the pri-mirnas involved in oc is an important process which, if understood, could positively impact current treatments and survival rates of patients with oc.

in the present study, we investigated the underlying network of mirnas, their targets, and their control mechanisms that are associated with oc development. changes in mirna networks between cancerous and healthy tissue have recently been illuminated  <cit> . here we concentrate on mirnas and their regulation in oc. we considered all human mirnas that are listed in mirbase  <cit> . for this set of mirnas, we extracted experimentally verified targets from tarbase  <cit>  and mirtarbase  <cit>  and selected those that have been associated with oc in accordance with the dragon database for exploration of ovarian cancer genes . in addition, we mapped transcription factor binding sites  onto extracted promoter regions of the human mirnas from mirbase to establish a link between tfs and mirnas. we considered two different sizes of promoter regions, 1000nt and 5000nt upstream of the mirna gene body. in addition, we incorporated human curated protein-protein interaction  data from several interaction databases  <cit>  to identify other proteins that may partake indirectly in the regulation of the mirnas and to establish links between all participating proteins in the network.

from these considerations, we derived two large networks  of interacting biological entities  that are centred on the mirnas and that impact oc. we combined mirnas, their downstream targets, and their upstream regulatory proteins in these networks in order to place these entities in the context of oc. subsequently, we devised a methodology to assign a rank to each node according to its potential for influencing the network's behaviour. this rank is based on the number of potential interaction partners that a network node might have as well as the type of interaction a node engages in. finally we identified regulatory network motifs in the networks. we defined regulatory network motifs to be the smallest possible group of nodes in the network that form a closed circle of interactions with each other. we propose that these network motifs are integral constituent parts of the network and the main stepping-stones that can be used to further an understanding of the networks behaviour, as well as potential targets for possible attempts to interfere with the network's behaviour.

the results of this network analysis show that mirnas and their regulation play an important role within oc and further in-depth research in this direction may be rewarding.

RESULTS
micrornas and their targets involved in oc
the focus of our study is to contribute to the current knowledge of human mirna involvement in oc. as a starting point we used all human mirnas that are listed in mirbase  <cit> . for these we extracted all experimentally confirmed mirna targets from tarbase  <cit>  and mirtarbase  <cit>  and subsequently restricted our analysis to those mirnas that have an experimentally confirmed target that is involved in the progression of oc according to the ddoc database  <cit> . in total we extracted  <dig> mirnas targeting  <dig> different human proteins. ddoc lists a total of  <dig> genes that are relevant for the progression of oc. this means that more than one third of the oc genes indentified so far are experimentally confirmed targets of mirnas. tarbase and mirtarbase together list no more than  <dig> human genes as confirmed targets of mirnas. this means that mirna targets are overrepresented among oc genes with regard to all human genes. while an explanation for this observation remains elusive, it merits a closer examination of the role of mirnas and their regulation in oc.

research by laios et al.  <cit>  suggests that various mirnas are involved in different stages of cancer progression. among the oc-relevant proteins that are experimentally proven to be targeted by these mirnas are several proteins that are key members of important cancer pathways. two examples are that mir- <dig> induces cell survival and cisplatin resistance through targeting the 3'-untranslated region  of pten, which leads to down-regulation of pten and the activation of the akt pathway  <cit> . pten is also targeted by  <dig> other mirnas. furthermore, mir-15b and mir- <dig> inhibit bcl <dig> expression thereby initiating cleavage of pro-caspase  <dig> and parp and consequently leading to apoptosis  <cit> . bcl <dig> is targeted by a total of  <dig> mirnas.

micrornas and their regulatory proteins
to increase our understanding of how the  <dig> mirnas identified above are regulated on the transcriptional level, we extracted the promoter region sequences of the mirna genes that correspond to the  <dig> mirnas identified above from the ucsc database  <cit> . two different promoter lengths of 1000nt and 5000nt upstream of the reported mirna gene were extracted thereby ensuring that one component of our analysis focuses on the transcriptional elements in the core promoter while the other considers a more comprehensive set of cis-regulatory elements operating at greater distance. differences in the resulting networks will aid in highlighting the interactions of regulatory proteins with regulatory motifs that are primarily located in the core promoter as well as regulatory processes that include more distally located regulatory sequence motifs. to do this, we mapped biobase transfac binding site motifs to the promoter regions  <cit>  and linked tfs to the mapped tfbss . we additionally extracted high-confidence transcription co-factors  that interact with these tfs from tcof-db  <cit> . we found that  <dig> tfs and  <dig> high-confidence tcofs may be involved in the core regulation  of the  <dig> oc-associated mirnas. when examining the larger and potentially more comprehensive set of tfbs ,  <dig> tfs were predicted to bind to the extended promoter regions of oc-associated mirnas. the seven additionally considered tfs  only have predicted binding sites that are more distally located from the tss and do not interact with any new high-confidence tcofs.

network construction
to generate a network, we extracted from ppi data  all interactions for the targets of all  <dig> oc-associated mirnas, relevant tfs, and tcofs. after we combined all the interactions we derived two networks of interest, one for core promoter regulatory elements  and one for the more comprehensive set of regulatory elements . table  <dig> shows the numbers of various types of nodes and numbers of interactions  in the two networks. the complete networks can be found in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  including ppis, transcriptional regulation and mirna targeting the role of mirnas in oc is seen as a complex and highly interconnected network.

the table shows the number of different nodes in the constructed networks. nw <dig> concentrates on regulatory elements in the core promoter while nw <dig> attempts to also include more distally located regulatory elements.

network hubs
to identify those components of the networks that have the most potential to influence to networks' overall behaviour, we implemented an edge-based ranking system. each node is ranked according to a score based on its outgoing edges of the first and second degree . however, there are three different types of edges within the network, two directed edge types, namely mirna to target association, and tf to mirna association, and an undirected edge of the type ppi. the latter is assumed to have the least influence on the information flow within the network. we assume that the most important edge in the network et is the interface between a mirna and its target, because this is a directed edge that has been experimentally proven. the second most important edge er is an association between a tf and a mirna, even though only predicted, has a direction. the least important edge ei is the undirected interaction between two proteins.

this means that each node in the network is ranked based on the number of potential binding partners as well as on the type of molecular interaction that it engages in. our networks thus constitute a model that attempts to describe mechanisms in the living cell in the form of a weighted directed graph. other aspects of a living cell, such as expression levels of the genes involved or the current developmental stage of the cell, are not part of our model.

applying our weighting algorithm  to the two networks nw <dig> and nw <dig> generated a ranking for each node. the complete node ranking for all nodes in nw <dig> and nw <dig> can be found in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  here we highlight nodes that were ranked high in both networks. we interpret these nodes as network hubs, potentially having the greatest influence on the regulation of mirnas involved in oc.

it is known that elements located far upstream from a gene can contribute to its regulation  <cit> . however, when sizing a gene's upstream region to study its promoter region one has to more or less arbitrarily set a length limit. any sequence length chosen is always a trade-off between excluding elements further upstream that might be relevant  and including them alongside irrelevant dna in the analysis introducing noise . while aware of these unavoidable shortcomings, we included two lengths that are frequently chosen as a compromise.

tfs that are ranked more highly in nw <dig> can be understood to have a higher concentration of binding sites close to the start of the mirna genes, while those that are ranked higher in nw <dig> can be interpreted as having a tendency to bind more distally from the gene body. naturally, the tfs appearing in nw <dig> are a subset of those appearing in nw <dig>  but the tfs that are exclusively in nw <dig> can be understood to bind to more remote binding sites. seven such tfs were identified .

there is an overlap of six tfs between the nodes ranked 1st to 10th in both networks  and therefore we regard these six tfs as the essential regulatory elements for mirna regulation in human oc. together they are predicted to regulate  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas in nw <dig>  which in turn target  <dig> out of  <dig> experimentally validated mirna target proteins. in nw <dig>  these six tfs participate in the regulation of all  <dig> oc relevant mirnas. this means that when an upstream regulatory region of 5000nt is considered, these six tfs are predicted to participate in the regulation of all oc relevant mirna genes and with that have a potential influence on the expression levels of all oc relevant genes whose mrnas are targeted by a mirna. to the best of our knowledge, brca <dig>  sp <dig>  tfe <dig>  po2f <dig> and esr <dig> have not been experimentally validated as tfs of the identified oc relevant mirnas. it has been demonstrated that esr <dig> mediated a decrease in hsa-mir- <dig> expression correlated with increased protein expression of endogenous hsa-mir- <dig> targets such as pdcd <dig>  pten, and bcl <dig>  <cit> . it has however not been validated that esr <dig> mediated this process as a tf of hsa-mir- <dig> and no binding site for esr <dig> is predicted in the hsa-mir- <dig> promoter region using our method. smad <dig> has been shown to bind and transcribe the hsa-mir- <dig> promoter during myoblast differentiation  <cit> . also, smad <dig> has been implicated in other diseases by acting as a tf for other mirnas, for example: smad <dig> drives hsa-mir- <dig> expression thereby mediating renal fibrosis  <cit>  and smad <dig> has been shown to bind the let-7d promoter thereby promoting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  <cit> .

the highest ranking mirnas according to our algorithm are hsa-mir-20a, hsa-mir-24- <dig>  hsa-mir-34a, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig>  this is the first time that hsa-mir- <dig> has been linked to the progression of oc. however, recent research is focused on designing hsa-mir- <dig> based therapies as it has been demonstrated that a moderate increase in hsa-mir- <dig> levels is observed in many types of malignancies, and transgenic over-expression of the mirna in mice results in cancer, whilst high levels of hsa-mir- <dig> expressed during immune response and hematopoietic lineage differentiation does not harm the organism  <cit> . it has recently been shown that hsa-mir-20a is differentially expressed in female oocytes  <cit> . in our networks hsa-mir-20a targets a total of nine genes that are implicated in the progression of oc. mir- <dig> has been found to regulate apoptosis in cancer cells and has already been suggested as a drug target for cancer therapy  <cit> . for graphical illustration, figure  <dig> shows a large, highly connected subnetwork of nw <dig> illuminating the interactions of six highly relevant tfs with six highly ranked mirnas and their  <dig> oc relevant targets. for simplicity the tcofs that interact with the tfs shown are omitted.

among the tcofs in the networks ep <dig>  rb, ubc <dig>  hdac <dig>  med <dig>  ctnb <dig>  hdac <dig>  pml and ncoa <dig> are ranked high and therefore have a high potential of being more influential with regard to the networks' overall behaviour than others. these nine tcofs appear in the list of best-ranked tcofs of both networks nw <dig> and nw <dig>  the human protein ep <dig> is the highest ranked tcof in both networks, nw <dig> and nw <dig>  it interacts with  <dig> tfs who in turn regulate all but five  oc-relevant mirnas in nw <dig> 

microrna regulatory network motifs
to better illustrate the cooperation of various nodes in the network we endeavoured to identify network motifs shared by both nw <dig> and nw <dig> networks. we thus searched for loop-like structures that potentially can be self-promoting, thus contributing to changed expression levels of genes and mirnas during oc progression. initially we found five mirnas in nw <dig>  that target one of their own predicted tfs.

next we identified three-element network motifs, which feature one mirna and two proteins. in this structure, one of the proteins acts as a tf by regulating the mirna, which in turn targets the other protein. the latter either simply interacts with the tf or serves as a tcof for the regulation of the mirna. this protein will also be associated with oc according to ddoc  <cit> . depending on the observed expression levels of the mirna in oc, the levels of the protein target would increase or decrease and depending on the type of interaction between the two proteins and depending on the type of tf , this type of loop structure would either be self-propagating  or self-cancelling . figure  <dig> summarises the structure under consideration. nw <dig> possesses  <dig> different loops of this type, while nw <dig> possesses  <dig> different loops. the full list of loop structures can be found in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  in nw <dig> , a total of  <dig>  tfs,  <dig>  mirnas and  <dig>  genes relevant for oc progression are involved in these feedback loops.

one interesting protein is the known proto-oncogene myc that is found up-regulated in many cancers  <cit> . it has recently been suggested that mirnas that are regulated by myc should be targeted as a possible therapeutic strategy  <cit> . in our network  myc is targeted by  <dig> different mirnas and is predicted to regulate  <dig> mirnas. according to our analysis myc is targeted by three mirnas, which are also predicted to be regulated by myc. in addition myc is part of  <dig> feedback loops. out of the  <dig> oc relevant gene targets that are involved in feedback loop structures, a significant majority  are involved in the cell cycle regulation pathway. this pathway is highly relevant for cancer development. while in general the enrichment of genes relevant to oc in the cell cycle pathway is quite high , the enrichment among genes targeted by mirnas and part of feedback loops is significantly higher. this means that the expression levels of mirnas in oc could have a significant impact on the cell cycle. for example, the tp <dig> protein acts as a cell cycle inhibitor. this protein is targeted by six mirna and is involved in  <dig> feedback loops of the type described above. another protein that is involved in the cell cycle regulation pathway is brca <dig>  <cit> . this protein is involved in  <dig> possible feedback loops either as a predicted regulator of mirnas or as a confirmed mirna target. for other types of cancer it has been shown that changed mirna expression levels have the potential to affect relevant pathways and to influence disease development  <cit> . our analysis shows that mirnas and their expression potentially play a major role in oc progression through influencing the cell cycle pathway. another pathway that is highly relevant for the progression of every cancer is apoptosis. we find five oc relevant genes to be involved in this pathway that are also targeted by mirnas and part of regulatory feedback loops. this points to another potential mechanism, by which mirnas and their regulation can possibly affect oc development and progression.

CONCLUSIONS
we have established two networks of mirna in human oc, one network that investigates core promoter elements and one that investigates a more comprehensive set of cis-regulatory elements of mirna regulation. an examination of these networks with a ranking algorithm and a search for loop-structured network motifs reveals some key players in the regulation of mirna in human oc. key mirnas in the progression of oc appear to be hsa-mir-20a, hsa-mir-24- <dig>  hsa-mir-34a, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig> and hsa-mir-hsa-mir- <dig> while key tfs are brca <dig>  sp <dig>  esr <dig>  smad <dig>  po2f <dig> and tfe <dig> among others.
