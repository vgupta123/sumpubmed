BACKGROUND
the specificity of synaptic connections in the sensory cortex is fundamental for the proper processing of sensory information. specific neural connections form according to neuron properties, such as the morphological type, laminar location, projection area, and similarity of sensory responsiveness . these specific connections can be achieved through molecular target-recognition mechanisms as well as activity-dependent mechanisms . neurons arising from the same single radial glial cell, a principal progenitor cell capable of generating neurons and glia in the cortex, are preferentially connected in the postnatal cortex  <cit> , suggesting that cell lineage contributes to connection specificity. however, little is known about the developmental process of lineage-dependent connection specificity, or how clonal neurons, which are derived from the same neural stem cell, are stamped with the identity of their common neural stem cell and guided to form mutual synaptic connections.

in epigenetic transcriptional regulation, which is important for embryonic development, dna-methylation patterns are determined by de novo methylation by the dna methyltransferases dnmt3a and dnmt3b in the embryo . in mice, dnmt3b is transiently expressed during stem-cell differentiation  <cit>  and dna methylation is inherited by cell progeny  <cit> . thus, dna methylation by dnmt3b might lead to neural stem cell labeling, which allows the descendants of individual stem cells to recognize each other. we recently demonstrated that dnmt3b predetermines the stochastic expression of clustered protocadherin  isoforms in various combinations  <cit> . in mice,  <dig> pcdh genes, which encode the cell-adhesion membrane protein cpcdhs, are organized into three gene clusters, pcdh-α, pcdh-β, and pcdh-γ  <cit> . each neuron expresses its own set of isoforms, about  <dig> of the  <dig> cpcdh-family isoforms . it seems that cpcdh isoforms, which exhibit remarkable extracellular diversity, bind homophilically in an isoform-specific manner , suggesting that they are involved in the discrimination between self and other neurons  <cit> . thus, cpcdh expression patterns predetermined by dnmt3b-dependent methylation in clonal neurons might reflect the progenitor identity and contribute to the recognition of pre- and postsynaptic partners to guide lineage-dependent synaptic connections.

in this study, we investigated the properties of lineage-dependent neural connections and the process and mechanism of their establishment. to this end, we targeted local neural connections in the whisker-related barrel in the mouse somatosensory cortex. layer  <dig> excitatory neurons within a barrel share sensory inputs from a single whisker, and they are commonly involved in information processing of the inputs. these neurons are synaptically connected with each other at a high frequency  <cit> . we here show that reciprocal neural connections are formed and selectively retained between clonal neurons, and that this connection specificity is lost in the absence of dnmt3b or cpcdhs. our results suggest that specific connections between clonal neurons are predetermined by dnmt3b-dependent gene regulation prior to neural differentiation, and that cpcdhs contribute to postnatal cortical neuron identification to guide lineage-dependent synaptic connections.

RESULTS
normal maturation of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons in chimeric mice
to visualize clonal neurons derived from a single neural stem cell, we generated chimeric mice using induced pluripotent stem  cells marked with green fluorescent protein . we established several ips cell lines from green mice , in which all the cells express gfp  <cit> , and then generated chimeric mice by injecting  <dig> ips cells into the blastocysts of wild-type mice at embryonic day  <dig>  . figure 1a shows a representative neonatal chimeric mouse with low gfp expression across the body surface. in the chimeric embryos showing relatively low expression of gfp across the body surface, the gfp-positive cells were very sparse in the cerebral vesicles at e <dig> , early in corticogenesis , indicating that the gfp-positive cells appearing in the postnatal cortex would be derived from the small number of gfp-positive stem cells observed at e <dig>   <cit> .fig.  <dig> visualization of clonal neurons using chimeric mice. a production of chimeric mice from wild-type blastocysts and green fluorescent protein -expressing induced pluripotent stem  cells. scale bar: 10 mm. b two examples of the cerebral vesicle in e <dig>  chimeric mice observed by bright field  and fluorescence microscopy . right panels are magnified views of the boxed area in the middle panels. arrowheads: gfp-labeled, ips cell-derived stem cells. scale bar: 1 mm , 500 μm , 50 μm . c distribution of gfp-positive cells in the neocortex of a postnatal day  <dig>  wild-type chimeric mouse. scale bar: 1 mm. d ips-cell-generated gfp-positive cells in the barrel cortex of a p <dig> wild-type chimeric mouse generated by implanting  <dig> ips cells  and one ips cell . the neurons  and glial cells  derived from ips cells were visualized by gfp. scale bar: 100 μm. e proportion of gfp-positive neurons in the analyzed area in each column after the implantation of  <dig> ips cells and one ips cell. the number of tested columns is shown above the plots. a bar indicates mean value. no significant difference between these two groups was observed; p =  <dig>  




around postnatal day  <dig> , gfp-positive cells in the neocortex of low-gfp-expressing mice consisted of neurons and glial cells, and were distributed vertically through all layers in a columnar fashion across wide neocortical areas . in layer  <dig> of the barrel cortex, these gfp-positive neurons represented about 10% of the neurons within a labeled columnar area . we also established chimeric mice by injecting one ips cell. these pups often showed undetectable gfp expression on the body surface. however, in the low-gfp-expressing mice, the proportion of gfp-positive cells in layer  <dig> was also about 10% . these observations are consistent with a previous study in chimeric mice generated using embryonic stem  cells showing that a single neural stem cell in a cerebral vesicle around e <dig> produces clonal neurons accounting for about 10% of the neurons in the local cortical region  <cit> . thus, in the low-gfp-expressing mice, the locally associated gfp-positive cortical neurons were likely generated from a neural stem cell that differentiated early in corticogenesis. we therefore used low-gfp-expressing chimeric mice in the following experiments.

next, using barrel cortical slices with gfp-positive neurons distributed across layers in a column-like manner, we conducted whole-cell recordings from presumed excitatory layer  <dig> neurons. the barrel structures in layer  <dig> were normal in these mice . we first examined whether the morphology of spiny stellate neurons, the major excitatory neurons in the layer  <dig> barrel, developed normally in these chimeric mice. we compared the morphology of gfp-positive spiny stellate neurons stained with biocytin after whole-cell recording in p18– <dig> chimeric mice with that of similarly treated spiny stellate neurons in age-matched wild-type nonchimeric mice , and found no differences in total dendritic length , number of branches , or expansion of dendritic territories . like the neurons in wild-type nonchimeric mice, the gfp-positive and -negative spiny neurons in the chimeric mice showed adaptive firing in response to depolarizing voltage steps , consistent with the previously reported firing patterns of layer  <dig> excitatory neurons  <cit> . no significant differences were found in the resting membrane potential , threshold of action potential generation , or input resistance  between these neuron groups. these results indicate that both the gfp-positive and -negative layer  <dig> excitatory neurons in the chimeric mice mature normally.fig.  <dig> morphological and electrophysiological properties of recorded layer  <dig> neurons. a barrel structure visualized by cytochrome oxidase reaction  in a chimeric mouse produced using green fluorescent protein -positive wild-type induced pluripotent stem cells. scale bar: 200 μm. b spiny stellate cells , and traces of the soma and dendrites from a wild-type  nonchimeric  and a gfp-positive wild-type chimeric mouse . green: gfp-positive cells without biocytin injection. dashed line: barrel. scale bar: 50 μm. c–e total dendritic length , number of dendritic branches , and sholl analysis   of spiny stellate cells in p18– <dig> wild-type nonchimeric mice  and chimeric mice . a bar indicates the mean . f representative traces of action potentials evoked by depolarizing current injection  in current clamp mode in neurons from wild-type nonchimeric mice  and in gfp-positive  and gfp-negative neurons  from chimeric mice. g–i box-and-whisker plots showing the value  of the resting membrane potential , the threshold to induce action potentials , and the input resistance  in each group at p18– <dig>  the number of cells is indicated above each plot




cell-lineage-dependent, high reciprocal connections between layer  <dig> excitatory neurons
we examined the synaptic connections between gfp-positive neuron pairs , which were presumed to be clonal neuron pairs, and between nonclonal gfp-positive and -negative neuron pairs  using dual whole-cell recordings from layer  <dig> at p9– <dig>  when synaptogenesis between layer  <dig> excitatory neurons starts in the barrel cortex  <cit> , and at p13– <dig> and p18– <dig>  we selected neuron pairs with an intercellular distance <50 μm within a barrel . excitatory neurons in the layer  <dig> barrel consist of spiny stellate neurons and star pyramidal neurons. the recorded neurons visualized successfully by biocytin were mostly spiny stellate neurons  with a few star pyramidal neurons , indicating that the recorded neurons were excitatory neurons. in each age group, the gfp-positive neurons represented about 10% of all of the neurons in layer  <dig> within 200 μm of the recorded neurons .fig.  <dig> synaptic connections between clonal and nonclonal neuron pairs in the barrel cortex. a differential interference contrast image of a brain slice with two recording electrodes in a layer  <dig> barrel. scale bar: 100 μm. b green fluorescent protein -positive cells in layer  <dig>  dashed line indicates a barrel. scale bar: 50 μm. c proportion of gfp-positive neurons in the analyzed area at each age. the number of tested columns is  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for p9– <dig>  p13– <dig>  and p18– <dig>  respectively. p =  <dig>  . d representative average traces  of action potentials evoked by brief depolarizing voltage pulses in one cell  and resultant excitatory postsynaptic currents in the other  with one-way  or reciprocal  connections between gfp-positive excitatory neurons in layer  <dig>  and gfp-positive and -negative neurons  in p18– <dig> wild-type chimeric mice. e percentage of p-p  and p-n  pairs with one-way , reciprocal , or no  connections; the number of recorded pairs is shown on each bar. number of mice for p-p pairs: p9– <dig>  p13– <dig> , p18– <dig> ; p-n pairs: p9– <dig>  p13– <dig> , p18– <dig> . *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> : connection probabilities in different age groups . f, g developmental changes in the connection probability  and the proportion of reciprocal connections in connected pairs . **p <  <dig> : p-p versus p-n pairs at the same age 




we examined the connections between simultaneously recorded neurons in both directions. figure 3d shows examples of one-way and reciprocal connections in p-p and p-n pairs. among the p-p pairs, the proportion of three types of pairs  changed significantly during the developmental stages examined, as tested using a χ <dig> test with a 3 ×  <dig> matrix after bonferroni correction . at p9– <dig>  about a third of the pairs showed one-way connections, while reciprocal connections were rare. the proportion of reciprocally connected pairs increased from p9– <dig> to p13– <dig>  while the proportion of one-way-connected pairs remained almost unchanged. if the probability of connection in one direction is independent of the presence or absence of connection in the other direction, the probability of reciprocal connections is expected to be the square of the connection probability. the proportion of reciprocal connections at p13– <dig>  was higher than the expected proportion , suggesting that reciprocal connections were preferentially established from p9– <dig> to p13– <dig>  thereafter, the proportion of one-way-connected pairs decreased, whereas that of reciprocally connected pairs remained almost the same. such clear, age-dependent changes were not observed among the p-n pairs . although the proportion of pairs with one-way, reciprocal, and no connections among p-n pairs was almost the same as that among p-p pairs at p9– <dig> , it remained unchanged during the next periods .

to further characterize the developmental changes in these connections, we calculated the connection probability, defined as the number of detected connections divided by the total number of tested connections . the connection probability was not significantly different between p-p and p-n pairs at p9– <dig> . at p13– <dig>  the probability in p-p pairs increased more than 2-fold  but that in p-n pairs remained almost the same; thus, p-p pairs connected more frequently than p-n pairs . thereafter, the connection probability became indistinguishable between p-p and p-n pairs at p18– <dig>  as observed initially, owing to the reduction of one-way connections in p-p pairs . thus, the connection probability appeared to increase transiently between clonal neuron pairs but remained almost unchanged between nonclonal neuron pairs during this period.

we also analyzed the reciprocity, which is the proportion of reciprocally connected pairs among connected pairs, and found clearly different developmental changes in the p-p versus p-n pairs. the reciprocity increased similarly in p-p and p-n pairs from p9– <dig> to p13– <dig>  thereafter, the reciprocity continued to increase in p-p pairs, whereas it remained almost unchanged in p-n pairs . consequently, at p18– <dig>  reciprocal connections accounted for the majority of the connections between p-p pairs  but for only 41% of those between p-n pairs . thus, most of the connections between clonal neurons became reciprocal by 3 weeks after birth. in p-p pairs, high connection probability at p13– <dig> and high reciprocity at p18– <dig> were commonly observed in most of the animals .

we examined whether there was any change in the morphological or electrophysiological properties of the spiny stellate cells between p13– <dig> and p18– <dig> when the dynamic, developmental change of the connectivity was observed in p-p pairs. no significant changes were found in the dendritic morphology of layer  <dig> spiny stellate neurons from p13– <dig> to p18– <dig> except that the number of branches very close to the soma increased . the small increase of branches near the soma might contribute to the transient increase of synapses in p-p pairs. in either the gfp-positive or gfp-negative neurons in chimeric mice, the resting membrane potential and threshold of action potential generation did not change from p13– <dig> to p18– <dig> . the input resistance decreased during this developmental period, consistent with a previous study   <cit> .

to examine whether the different developmental changes in p-p and p-n pairs resulted from an impaired connection development in chimeric mice, we compared the synaptic connectivity in chimeric and nonchimeric mice. the discrimination of p-p pairs from p-n pairs was not possible in nonchimeric mice, because the clonal neurons were not gfp-labeled. however, most of the cell pairs sampled from nonchimeric mice were probably p-n pairs, because clonal neurons originating from a single neural stem cell accounted for only about 10% of the neurons. the proportion of pairs with one-way, reciprocal, and no connections in nonchimeric mice  was similar to that observed among the p-n pairs in chimeric mice at both p13– <dig>  and p18– <dig>  , indicating that the neural connections developed normally in the chimeric mice.

the chimeric mice used were mostly generated by injecting ips cells derived from c57bl/ <dig> mice into bdf <dig> blastocysts, although we used chimeric mice originating from c57bl/ <dig> blastocysts in some of the experiments conducted at p18– <dig>  thus, the gfp-positive and gfp-negative neurons were derived from different mouse strains in most experiments. although this difference might have caused the connectivity to differ between p-p pairs and p-n pairs, the connectivity at p18– <dig> was similar in chimeric mice generated using c57bl/ <dig> blastocysts versus bdf <dig> blastocysts . this result suggests that the differences in connectivity arose from differences in cell lineage rather than in the mouse strains used for the ips cells and blastocysts.

the connectivity difference between p-p and p-n pairs might also be ascribed to the fact that ips cells are occasionally missing some genes  <cit> . however, we found similar high proportions of reciprocal connections in the p-p pairs at p18– <dig> for three different ips cell lines . these results strongly support the view that reciprocal connections are frequently formed between layer  <dig> excitatory neurons originating from the same stem cell during normal development.

dnmt3b is required for cell-lineage-dependent high reciprocal connections
we next asked whether epigenetic regulation of gene expression is involved in lineage-dependent reciprocal connections. in mice, the dna methyltransferase dnmt3b is strongly expressed in neural stem cells at an early embryonic stage, but it disappears in the e <dig>  cortex  <cit> . thus, dnmt3b-induced dna methylation might be involved in the labeling of neural stem cells generated around e <dig>  because the dna methylation pattern is inherited by the cell progeny  <cit> , this labeling might contribute to the lineage-dependent connectivity in the postnatal cortex. to test this possibility, we produced chimeric mice using gfp-labeled ips cells derived from dnmt3b-knockout  mice  <cit> . in these mice, the barrel structure was normal , and the proportion of gfp-positive neurons in layer  <dig> of the barrel cortex was similar to that in the wild-type chimeric mice . most of the recorded gfp-positive neurons were spiny stellate neurons , and a few were star pyramids . these spiny stellate neurons had dendritic morphologies similar to those observed in wild-type nonchimeric mice , and the electrophysiological membrane properties were similar between the gfp-positive neurons in wild-type and dnmt3b-ko chimeric mice . these results indicated that the dnmt3b-ko neurons developed normally.fig.  <dig> effect of dnmt3b deficiency on the morphology and synaptic connectivity of clonal neurons. a barrel structure visualized by cytochrome oxidase reaction  in a chimeric mouse produced using dnmt3b-knockout  induced pluripotent stem cells. scale bar: 200 μm. b, c distribution  and proportion  of dnmt3b-ko cells in the analyzed area in each column. the number of columns is  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for p9– <dig>  p13– <dig>  and p18– <dig>  respectively. p =  <dig>  . scale bar: 100 μm. d dnmt3b-ko spiny stellate cell  and traces of its soma and dendrites . scale bar: 50 μm. e–g total dendritic length , number of dendritic branches , and sholl analyses  of dnmt3b-ko  and wild-type  spiny stellate cells at p18– <dig>  a bar indicates the mean . no significant differences in morphological parameters between these two groups were observed; p =  <dig>  , p =  <dig>  , and p >  <dig>   . h–k dual whole-cell recordings from dnmt3b-ko gfp-positive excitatory neurons  pairs. h representative average  traces of presynaptic spikes  and resultant excitatory postsynaptic currents  between dnmt3b-ko p-p pairs with a one-way  or reciprocal  connection. i percentage of dnmt3b-ko p-p pairs with one-way , reciprocal , or no  connections. numbers of recorded pairs are indicated on the bars. number of mice: p9– <dig>  p13– <dig> , p18– <dig> . *p <  <dig> : connection probabilities in different age groups . j, k connection probability  and reciprocity  of dnmt3b-ko p-p  and wild-type p-p  or gfp-positive and -negative neuron   cell pairs. **p <  <dig>  compared with wild-type clonal pairs 




at p9– <dig>  the proportion of p-p pairs with one-way, reciprocal, and no connections in dnmt3b-ko chimeric mice was similar to that in wild-type chimeric mice, and most of the connections were one-way . although the proportion of reciprocal, but not one-way, connections in dnmt3b-ko p-p pairs increased to some extent from p9– <dig> to p13– <dig>  the change was insignificant , different from p-p pairs in wild-type chimeric mice. at p13– <dig>  the proportion of pairs with one-way, reciprocal, and no connections observed among dnmt3b-ko p-p pairs was not significantly different from that among wild-type p-n pairs . the proportion remained unchanged from p13– <dig> to p18– <dig> , in contrast to the notable decline in one-way connections observed in wild-type p-p pairs . there was no significant difference in the proportion between dnmt3b-ko p-p pairs and wild-type p-n pairs at p18– <dig> , indicating that dnmt3b deficiency impaired the establishment of lineage-specific reciprocal connections at the later stage.

this difference in connectivity between dnmt3b-ko and wild-type p-p pairs was clearly represented in the connection probability and reciprocity . the connection probability in dnmt3b-ko p-p pairs was slightly smaller than that in wild-type p-p pairs at p9– <dig> , and significantly increased from p9– <dig> to p13– <dig> , with a rate similar to that found in wild-type p-p pairs . as a result, at p13– <dig>  the connection probability was not significantly different from that in wild-type p-p pairs  or in wild-type p-n pairs , and was intermediate between the connection probabilities in wild-type p-p and p-n pairs. the connection probability continued to increase albeit insignificantly between p13– <dig> and p18– <dig> in dnmt3b-ko p-p pairs , unlike the steep decrease toward the initial value seen in wild-type p-p pairs. the reciprocity in dnmt3b-ko p-p pairs at p9– <dig>  and at p13– <dig>  was almost the same as that observed in wild-type p-p pairs and p-n pairs at the same ages . notably, at p18– <dig>  the reciprocity  was significantly lower than that in wild-type p-p pairs  and was indistinguishable from that in wild-type p-n pairs . these results were commonly obtained in most of the dnmt3b-ko chimeric mice . thus, dnmt3b deficiency impaired the transient increase in connections between clonal neuron pairs partially and the late removal of one-way connections totally, indicating that dnmt3b is necessary for the development of cell-lineage-dependent reciprocal connections.

requirement of cpcdh for cell-lineage-dependent high reciprocal connections
the deletion of dnmt3b causes hypomethylation of the promoter regions of cpcdh-α, cpcdh-β, and cpcdh-γ isoforms in the embryonic brain and in individual differentiated cerebellar purkinje neurons  <cit> . the dna methylation level of cpcdh genes in e <dig>  embryos is the same as that in p <dig> cortex in wild-type mice and it is correlated with the expression level of each cpcdh isoform  <cit> . these findings suggest that if the dnmt3b-dependent expression of cpcdh isoforms contributes to the establishment of lineage-dependent reciprocal connections, dnmt3b deficiency might disrupt cpcdh expression, thereby abolishing the lineage-specific reciprocal connections between dnmt3b-ko clonal cells. to test this possibility, we produced cpcdh-ko mice lacking all of the cpcdh isoforms , and established chimeric mice using tdtomato-labeled ips cells derived from the cpcdh-ko mice.

the barrel structure developed normally in cpcdh-ko chimeric mice  and the proportion of tdtomato-positive neurons in layer  <dig> of the barrel cortex was similar to that of gfp-positive neurons in the wild-type chimeric mice . most of the tdtomato-positive neurons recorded from the layer  <dig> barrel were spiny stellate neurons ; the rest were star pyramidal neurons . the dendritic morphology of the cpcdh-deficient spiny stellate neurons was similar to that observed in wild-type nonchimeric mice . the electrophysiological membrane properties of cpcdh-ko and wild-type gfp-positive neurons were similar . these results indicate that the cpcdh-ko neurons developed normally.fig.  <dig> effect of cpcdh deficiency on the morphology and synaptic connectivity of clonal neurons. a barrel structure visualized by cytochrome oxidase reaction  in a chimeric mouse prepared using cpcdh-knockout  induced pluripotent cells. scale bar: 200 μm. b, c distribution  and proportion  of tdtomato-labeled cpcdh-ko cells in the analyzed area in each column. number of columns is  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for p9– <dig>  p13– <dig>  and p18– <dig>  respectively. p =  <dig>  . scale bar: 100 μm. d a cpcdh-deficient spiny stellate neuron  and trace of its soma and dendrites . scale bar: 50 μm. e–g total dendritic length , number of dendritic branches , and sholl analyses  of cpcdh-ko  and wild-type  spiny stellate cells﻿ at p18– <dig>  a bar indicates the mean . no significant differences in morphological parameters between cpcdh-deficient cells and wild-type cells were observed; p =  <dig>  , p =  <dig>  , and p >  <dig>   . h–k dual whole-cell recordings from cpcdh-ko gfp-positive excitatory neurons  pairs. h representative average  traces of presynaptic spikes  and resultant excitatory postsynaptic currents  between cpcdh-ko p-p pairs with one-way  or reciprocal  connections. i percentage of cpcdh-ko p-p pairs with each connection type. number of recorded pairs is indicated on each bar. number of mice: p9– <dig>  p13– <dig> , p18– <dig> . developmental changes in connection probability  and reciprocity  in cpcdh-ko p-p  and wild-type p-p  or or gfp-positive and -negative neuron  cell pairs. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  compared with wild-type clonal cell pairs 




the development of synaptic connections between cpcdh-ko p-p pairs proceeded considerably differently from that between wild-type p-p pairs. at p9– <dig>  the proportion of pairs with one-way, reciprocal, and no connections was significantly different between cpcdh-ko and wild-type p-p pairs . the proportion among cpcdh-ko p-p pairs did not show any significant changes from p9– <dig> to p13– <dig>  or from p13– <dig> to p18– <dig> . the proportion among cpcdh-ko p-p pairs was not significantly different compared with wild-type p-p  or p-n pairs , at p13– <dig>  at p18– <dig>  the proportion among cpcdh-ko p-p pairs was significantly different from that among wild-type p-p pairs  but not wild-type p-n pairs . we confirmed that no significant differences were present in neural connectivity between cpcdh-ko chimeric mice generated using two different ips cell lines . the connection probability for cpcdh-ko p-p pairs was highest at p9– <dig> and decreased slightly from p9– <dig> to p13– <dig> , with no further change at p18– <dig> . compared with the wild-type p-p pairs at comparable ages, the connection probability in cpcdh-ko p-p pairs was about 2-fold higher  at p9– <dig>  significantly lower at p13– <dig> , and similar at p18– <dig> .

the reciprocity in cpcdh-ko p-p pairs showed a developmental change very different from that in wild-type p-p and p-n pairs . the reciprocity was highest at p9– <dig> and decreased from p9– <dig> to p13– <dig>  with no further change at p18– <dig> , in contrast to the continuous increase throughout this period in wild-type p-p pairs. the reciprocity in cpcdh-ko p-p pairs was significantly higher than in both wild-type p-p  and p-n pairs  at p9– <dig>  whereas at p18– <dig>  it was significantly lower than that in wild-type p-p pairs  and almost the same as that in wild-type p-n pairs . these developmental changes were commonly observed in most of the cpcdh-ko chimeric mice . these results indicate that the cpcdh deficiency impaired the development of connections between p-p pairs more severely than the dnmt3b deficiency, while the selective removal of one-way connections did not occur with either deficiency. thus, it is likely that cpcdh is indispensable for the whole process by which lineage-dependent connection specificity is established, and that dnmt3b is mainly required for the removal of one-way connections between clonal neurons.

regulation of the cpcdh expression pattern by dnmt3b in barrel cortical neurons
we finally asked whether dnmt3b indeed regulates the expression of cpcdh isoforms in layer  <dig> neurons of the barrel cortex. the expression pattern of cpcdh isoforms in clonal neurons was compared between wild-type and dnmt3b-ko chimeric mice by in situ hybridization. we observed the mrna signal for a single cpcdh isoform. in addition, we labeled all of the cells by hoechst  <dig> and clonal cells by immunostaining with an anti-gfp antibody. among the cpcdh isoforms, γa <dig> and γa <dig> were selected for the analysis because of the high detection efficiency of their probes.

the cpcdh isoforms of γa <dig> and γa <dig> were both sparsely expressed in the barrel cortical cells in wild-type chimeric mice , consistent with our previous observation in wild-type non-chimeric mice  <cit> . using cpcdh-ko chimeric mice, we confirmed the reliability of our method by comparing the mrna signals for each cpcdh isoform between cpcdh-ko  and wild-type  cells . the mrna signals for each cpcdh isoform were rarely detected in the tdtomato-positive cpcdh-ko cells, but were clearly detected in a portion of the adjacent tdtomato-negative wild-type cells.fig.  <dig> effect of dnmt3b deficiency on the expression of cpcdh isoforms. a distribution of mrna signals  for γa <dig>  and γa <dig>  in wild-type  chimeric mice. scale bar: 100 μm. b, c mrna signals  for γa <dig>  and γa <dig>  in cpcdh-knockout  chimeric mice  and γa <dig> expression at higher magnification . all cells and cpcdh-ko cells were visualized by hoechst  <dig> staining  and a probe for the td-tomato gene , respectively. scale bar: 20 μm  and 10 μm . d distribution of mrna signals  for γa <dig>  and γa <dig>  in clonal dnmt3b-ko cells visualized by immunostaining with an anti-green fluorescent protein  antibody  in dnmt3b-ko chimeric mice. scale bar: 20 μm. e proportion of γa3-positive  and γa7-positive  neurons in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dnmt3b-ko cells  and wild-type cells  observed in slices prepared from dnmt3b-ko chimeric mice and wild-type chimeric mice, respectively. the proportion of host-derived wild-type neurons that expressed γa <dig> or γa <dig> is shown in gray. the number of analyzed slices is shown above each box-and-whisker plot . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  




to assess the proportion of cpcdh-expressing neurons, the neurons were morphologically discriminated from glial cells . the proportion of γa3-expressing neurons among dnmt3b-ko clonal neurons  in dnmt3b-ko chimeric mice was about twice that among wild-type clonal neurons  in wild-type chimeric mice , whereas no significant difference was found in the proportion of host neurons  that expressed γa <dig> between the two types of chimeric mice . similar results were obtained for the γa <dig> isoform . thus, dnmt3b deficiency caused an increase in cpcdh expression in barrel cortical neurons. these results suggest that dnmt3b epigenetically regulates cpcdh expression, so that each group of clonal neurons expresses restricted subtypes of cpcdh isoforms.

discussion
here we found that the synaptic connections between clonal neurons in layer  <dig> of the barrel cortex became mostly reciprocal when they were connected during postnatal development, and that the postnatal establishment of these connections required dnmt3b and cpcdhs. our analyses suggest that the dnmt3b-mediated regulation of gene expression during embryonic development predetermines lineage-specific connectivity in the postnatal cortex and that the cpcdhs are involved in the total developmental process for establishing lineage-dependent connection specificity.

advantages of chimeric mice and the origin of gfp-positive neurons
to examine cell-lineage-dependent connections, we used chimeric mice generated using ips cells marked with fluorescent proteins. this system also allowed us to delete a particular molecule from only the ips cell-derived clonal neurons, and to analyze the effect of the deletion on lineage-dependent synaptic connections. although dnmt3b-ko mice and cpcdh-ko mice are embryonic lethal  <cit>  and perinatal lethal , respectively, chimeric mice generated using ips cells derived from these ko mice grew well, allowing us to analyze neural circuits composed of ko neurons. because ips cells are occasionally missing some genes  <cit> , an unexpected deficiency of genes might affect neural connectivity between clonal neurons labeled using ips cells. to avoid this possibility, we examined synaptic connections in chimeric mice generated using two to three different ips cell lines and confirmed similar neural connectivity between them.

the proportion of cells derived from ips cells in chimeric mice depends on the number of implanted and surviving ips cells. under our experimental conditions, the slices chosen for electrophysiological analyses included gfp-positive or tdtomato-positive neurons and glial cells that were distributed both locally and vertically though all layers in the barrel cortex. the distribution and proportion of fluorescently labeled cells within a column were indistinguishable between chimeric mice receiving one and  <dig> ips cell implants, and almost the same as those of cortical neurons arising from a single stem cell differentiated early in corticogenesis  <cit> . taken together, the fluorescently labeled neurons analyzed here appeared to originate from a single neural stem cell that differentiated at the early stage of corticogenesis.

developmental process for establishing lineage-specific connections
we found no difference in synaptic connectivity between clonal and nonclonal neuron pairs at the time point when synaptogenesis between cortical neurons normally starts  <cit> . in clonal, but not nonclonal, neuron pairs, we observed a transient increase in the proportion of connected pairs, and then a selective removal of one-way connections, resulting in high connection reciprocity, during the developmental period when dendritic spines are actively formed and eliminated  <cit> . these results suggest that the high reciprocity in clonal pairs is attained by two sequential processes: an initial addition of new connections, which establishes reciprocal connections preferentially; and a subsequent selective retention of reciprocal connections.

molecular mechanisms for establishing lineage-dependent connections
a previous study demonstrated that cortical neurons arising from a single radial glial progenitor cell, called sister neurons, are more frequently connected with each other than nonsister neurons  <cit> . in the present study, we targeted neurons residing in the same layer and characterized postnatal developmental changes of neural connectivity that occurred specifically in clonal neuron pairs. the visualized clonal neurons presumably arose from a single neural stem cell that differentiated earlier than radial glial cells generating sister neurons  <cit> ; this view is supported by the greater number of fluorescently labeled neurons in the present study than in the previous one. in both studies, neurons originating from the same progenitor cell were more specifically connected with each other than neurons originating from different progenitor cells. in the postnatal visual cortex, progeny neurons fluorescently labeled at early versus late stages of corticogenesis share a selective responsiveness to similar stimuli  <cit> . therefore, the mechanisms for establishing lineage-dependent connections may be at least partially common to groups of neurons originating from the stem cells differentiated at different embryonic stages. in the previous study, sister neurons formed a transient electrical coupling prior to establishing synaptic connections  <cit> . in this study, we found that cpcdh was required for lineage-specific reciprocal connections. to our knowledge, although the role of cpcdh in establishing gap junctions has not been determined, gap junctions might also help to establish lineage-dependent synaptic connections between clonal neurons in layer  <dig> 

the present study showed for the first time that the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in a neural stem cell was required for the postnatal establishment of lineage-dependent connections. the dna-methylation patterns determined by dnmt3b can be inherited by progeny cells  <cit> . in mice, dnmt3b is transiently expressed during stem-cell differentiation but disappears at a late stage of corticogenesis  <cit> . thus, dnmt3b-induced dna methylation may be involved in labeling the lineage of clonal cells derived from a neural stem cell differentiated during early corticogenesis. the deficiency of dnmt3b resulted in a complete failure to eliminate one-way connections established between clonal neurons, and it suppressed the initial increase in synaptic connections between clonal neurons to some extent. these findings suggest that the dnmt3b-dependent epigenetic memory in individual stem cells may be necessary for establishing lineage-dependent reciprocal connectivity in the postnatal cortex, which occurs mainly through the selective removal of one-way connections.

it has been suggested that cpcdh is involved in the formation or elimination of synaptic connections. for example, deleting all of the pcdh-γ isoforms inhibits synaptic formations in the spinal cord  <cit> , while the expression of only one type of pcdh-γ isoform in retinal starburst amacrine cells impairs the pruning of redundant synapses between these cells  <cit> . even when the pcdhs were totally deleted in the current study, synaptic connections were formed between clonal neurons at a proportion close to that observed in the presence of these genes. however, both the connection probability and connection reciprocity in these neurons were highest at the initial stage, and they decreased with development. these findings suggest that cpcdhs finely regulate the rate and timing of the synaptic formation and elimination between clonal neurons, although are not indispensable for the simple formation of connections. the earlier appearance of the peak in the connection probability and reciprocity in cpcdh-ko cell pairs might have resulted from the disorder of this regulation. because cpcdhs interact with multiple other proteins and regulate intracellular signaling pathways, they can regulate synaptic formation or elimination through these pathways . a deficiency in cpcdhs might cause the abnormal formation of connections between clonal neurons through the alteration in these signaling pathways.

the heteromer of cpcdh isoforms functions as a homophilic binding unit that induces a cell–cell interaction at the cellular membrane  <cit> . if a particular combination of cpcdhs is selectively expressed in each group of clonal neurons in the barrel cortex as a result of dnmt3b-induced dna methylation during early corticogenesis, the homophilic interactions between cpcdh heteromers may play a crucial role in the selective removal of one-way connections between clonal neurons. in line with this hypothesis, dnmt3b deficiency increased the proportion of clonal neurons expressing each cpcdh isoform in the barrel cortex, as observed previously in cerebellar purkinje cells  <cit> . this condition may disturb the expression pattern of cpcdh isoforms in each group of clonal neurons. we observed that deficiencies of cpcdh and dnmt3b both reduced the reciprocity in p-p pairs to the level in p-n pairs and hence caused clonal neurons to fail to establish lineage-specific connection reciprocity, suggesting that the expression pattern of cpcdh isoforms – presumably regulated by dnmt3b – is important for the selective maintenance of reciprocal connections. on the other hand, we observed that the peak value of the connection probability in wild-type p-p pairs was slightly higher than that in dnmt3b-deficient p-p pairs at the early stage, whereas it was far lower than that in cpcdh-deficient p-p pairs. therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the regulation of cpcdh isoform expression by mechanisms other than dnmt3b contributes to the establishment of reciprocal connections, especially the initial increase in synaptic connections between clonal neurons  <cit> . in addition, other genes methylated by dnmt3b can contribute to lineage-specific connectivity, because dnmt3b is known to regulate the expression of many genes  <cit> . to verify our hypothesis, it will be necessary to comprehensively analyze the expression of multiple cpcdh isoforms in clonal and nonclonal neurons.

functional significance of lineage-dependent specific connections
in the visual cortex, the orientation selectivity of cortical neurons is already established by the time the eyes open  <cit> , and clonal neurons respond selectively to a similar orientation of visual stimulation  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the cell-lineage-dependent establishment of neuronal connections is one of the mechanisms for the initial wiring of cell assembly underlying the selective responsiveness of cortical neurons before sensory experience.

previous studies in layer  <dig> spiny stellate neurons of the barrel cortex demonstrated that the proportion of reciprocally connected pairs was consistent with that expected from the probability of unidirectional connection, assuming that the probability of connection in one direction is independent of the presence or absence of connection in the other direction  <cit> . however, we found that the probability of reciprocal connections between clonal neurons was much higher than that expected from the probability of unidirectional connection. in the visual cortex, adjacent layer 2/ <dig> pyramidal neurons with similar visual responsiveness are preferentially connected, and visual responses are more similar in reciprocally connected pairs than in pairs with a one-way connection  <cit> . in addition, these feature-specific connections mature without visual experience to some extent  <cit> . taken together, in addition to activity-dependent mechanisms, cell-lineage-specific reciprocal connections may be involved in organizing microcircuits composed of neurons with similar sensory responsiveness.

dnmt3b and cpcdh are candidate proteins involved in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism . thus, deficiencies in lineage-specific neural connections may play a role in these neuropsychiatric disorders, and further investigation into the underlying mechanisms of lineage-dependent connectivity may shed light on the pathology of these diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that local, reciprocal neural connections are selectively formed and retained between clonal neurons in layer  <dig> of the barrel cortex during postnatal development, and that dnmt3b and cpcdhs are required for the establishment of lineage-specific reciprocal connections. these findings indicate that lineage-specific connection reciprocity is predetermined by dnmt3b during embryonic development, and suggest that the dnmt3b-dependent expression of cpcdh isoforms can at least partly contribute to postnatal cortical neuron identification to guide lineage-dependent synaptic connections in the neocortex.
