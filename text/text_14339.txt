BACKGROUND
plk <dig> , is a member of the polo-like kinase  family of serine/threonine kinases which are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, cellular response to stress such as dna damage, and the duplication and maturation of centrosomes  <cit> . deregulation of the plks by overexpression, depletion via epigenetic silencing or loss of heterozygosity  has implicated them in the development of centrosome abnormalities and has been associated with a cin  phenotype and malignancy. plk <dig> is a major regulator of centriole duplication as indicated first by an increase in the number of supernumerary centrosomes correlated with plk <dig> overexpression, and second, by a reduction in centriole duplication with the eventual development of mono-polar spindles upon repeated cell divisions observed after rna interference for plk <dig>  <cit> . homozygous null plk <dig> mice are embryonic lethal at ~e <dig>  of development, with an increase in the proportion of mitotic cells, whereas plk <dig> heterozygous mice are phenotypically normal  <cit> . interestingly aged plk <dig> heterozygous mice display haploinsufficiency with tumours developing at a high frequency in major sites such as the liver and lung  <cit> . haploinsufficiency for plk <dig> affects normal progression through the cell cycle and maintenance of the genome. for example, in a two thirds liver hepatectomy model, plk <dig> heterozygous hepatocytes had an increased rate of tri- and tetra-polar spindle complexes with frequent mitotic errors as compared to those form wild-type regenerating livers  <cit> . at 9– <dig> months post-hepatectomy all the plk <dig> heterozygous mice had abnormal liver morphology and there was an increased rate of tumourigenesis  <cit> . these results suggest that plk <dig> haploinsufficiency potentially leads to increased aneuploidy a likely tumour promoting event. plk <dig> loss also has implications in human malignancy, where loh for plk <dig> was found in the majority of a small sample of hepatocellular carcinomas  <cit> .

plks 1– <dig> in general all play important roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and the dna damage response. furthermore, several of their respective substrates are in common, with the individual plks likely placing their substrate under tighter or opposing control. for example, both plk <dig> and plk <dig> phosphorylate cdc25c and p <dig> by targeting different residues in each case. plk <dig> phosphorylates cdc25c on serine  <dig>  <cit> , a site that is also targeted by chk <dig> and chk <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylation of serine  <dig> of cdc25c is inhibitory, which is due to sequestration of the protein phosphatase in the cytoplasm by 14-3- <dig> protein, thus blocking mitotic entry  <cit> . human cdc25c is phosphorylated on ser- <dig> by plk <dig>  part of an activation amplification loop that increases the phosphatases activity to allow mitotic entry  <cit> . polo-like kinase  <dig>  is known to inhibit p <dig> function by physical interaction  <cit> , while phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser  <dig> by plk <dig> serves to functionally link dna damage with increased p <dig> activity  <cit> . chk <dig> is another protein that is phosphorylated by the plks. plk <dig> interacts with, phosphorylates and colocalizes with chk <dig>  <cit> , plk <dig> phosphorylates chk <dig> at two residues, which results in subsequent phosphorylation of chk <dig> on t <dig> by atm in response to dna damage, thus upregulating chk <dig> activity  <cit> .

similar to the other plk family members, which have established roles in dna damage pathways, plk <dig> likely functions within or is a target of dna damage pathways. this is supported by the observation that plk <dig> interacts with and phosphorylates p <dig>  <cit> . plk <dig> expression is repressed in a p <dig> dependent manner in response to dna damaging agents, with the p <dig> repression of plk <dig> activity occurring through the recruitment of a histone deacetylase  transcription repressor  <cit> . additionally, cdc25c, a key regulator of the entrance into mitosis and target of dna damage proteins, is a substrate for plk <dig>  <cit> . significant phenotypic differences are also observed between plk <dig> wild-type and heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts   <cit> . contrary to what would be expected, heterozygous plk <dig> mefs display a phenotype typified by multiple centrosomes which lead to multipolar spindles, mitotic failure and delayed proliferation  <cit> .

all the evidence published to date is consistent with a model as suggested by habendanck et al  in which reduced plk <dig> activity causes occasional cellular division failure as a result of aberrant centrosome duplication and subsequent mitotic spindle malformation <cit> , this cell division failure can lead to either aneuploidy or polyploidy, which could in turn contribute to the higher incidence of tumors in heterozygous mice. as an initial step in further characterizing the effect of lower plk <dig> levels on the cell, we utilized microarrays to provide a general survey of differences in the transcript profiles of plk <dig> wild-type and heterozygous mefs. here, we report on a spectrum of genes that are upregulated or downregulated in the plk <dig> heterozygous mefs, including the key cell cycle regulators p <dig>  p <dig> and chk <dig> and the presence of increased p <dig> levels/activity as a result of plk <dig> haploinsufficiency.

methods
establishment of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts 
mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines were established from  <dig>  day old wild-type and heterozygous plk <dig> embryos as previously described  <cit> . all experiments utilizing mice as well as embryos and cell lines derived from them were performed in accordance to ccac guidelines and approved by the university of windsor animal care committee. the mefs were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagles medium  containing 20% fetal bovine serum , 1% penicillin-streptomycin  and  <dig> ug/ml gentamicin  and maintained at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  all experiments were performed with mefs at passage 2– <dig> 

flow cytometry
wild type and heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown to approximately 80% confluency. the mefs were then harvested, fixed in 80% ice-cold ethanol, stained with pi and the cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometry on a beckman coulter cytomics fc  <dig> flow cytometer. flow cytometry results were analyzed using cytomics rxp analysis software . presented results are based on three independent experiments.

microarray analysis
mef cells were grown asynchronously to a confluency of 70–80% with total rna isolation performed using the rneasy mini kit . in order to confirm the integrity and quality of the rna, the rna was run on the  <dig> bioanalyzer  using the rna  <dig> nano assay kit. total rna extracted from mefs was subjected to microarray analysis at the university health network  microarray centre in toronto. the samples were labeled using the uhn's standard indirect labeling protocol and hybridized to a mouse  <dig> k chip. results are based on three independent replicates with subsequent analysis performed using "the institute for genomic research  microarray software suite".

semi-quantitative rt-pcr
reverse transcription  was performed using superscript ii reverse transcriptase  as per the manufacturer's instructions. all forward and reverse primers for pcr were designed to span intron/exon boundaries in order to prevent amplification of contaminating genomic dna in the cdna mixture. primers for the amplification of plk <dig>  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , prohibitin, sap <dig> binding protein , and wnt-inducible signaling pathway protein  and the size of their respective products are summarized in table  <dig>  pcr was performed using hot start taq dna polymerase  and the results of each amplification were normalized to the gapdh internal control.

exposure of mefs to dna damaging agents
wild-type and heterozygous mefs were exposed to ultraviolet light  at  <dig> mj/cm <dig> using a gs gene linker uv chamber  or ionizing radiation  of  <dig> gy using a rx- <dig> cabinet x-ray system  and rna or protein was isolated from the mefs at the specified time points.

western blot analysis
cells were lysed in lysis buffer , the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation and equal amount of total protein was loaded into 8%  sds-page gels. following separation, proteins were transferred onto a pvdf membrane, and western blot analysis was performed using standard methods. the primary antibodies were as follows, anti-p <dig> , anti-chk <dig> , anti-chk <dig>  , anti-p <dig> , anti-cdc25c  and anti-gapdh . the secondary antibodies were as follow: anti-mouse hrp , anti-rabbit hrp  and were used at dilutions recommended by manufacturers.

apoptosis assay
the level of apoptosis was determined in heterozygous and wild-type plk <dig> mefs using a tdt-mediated dutp nick-end labeling  assay as per the manufacturer's provided protocol . cells were exposed to  <dig> mj/cm <dig> to induce uv mediated dna damage and analyzed  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr, and  <dig> hr post radiation. results are based on three independent experiments.

x-gal senescence staining
mefs were grown to 70–80% confluency and then stained using a β-galactosidase staining kit . cells were washed in pbs, fixed in a 2% formaldehyde solution and incubated overnight in  <dig> mg/ml x-gal staining solution. senescent cells were identified by the presence of a typical perinuclear blue stain.

p <dig> activity assay
the activity of p <dig> from plk <dig> heterozygous and wild-type mefs was analyzed with the active p <dig> activity assay kit . cells were grown to 70–80% confluency and  <dig> ug of nuclear extracts  were subjected to the capture elisa assay as per the manufacturer's protocol. absorbance measurements were performed at  <dig> nm on a victor  <dig> spectrophotometer. results are based on three independent experiments and normalized to the wild-type controls.

RESULTS
comparison between transcript profiles in wild-type and heterozygous plk <dig> mefs using microarray
a number of phenotypic differences have been observed between wild-type and heterozygous plk <dig> mefs  <cit> . for example, heterozygous mefs exhibit a growth rate approaching one half that of their wild-type counterparts  <cit> . many of these cells contain multiple centrosomes, micronuclei and mitotic defects  <cit> . in the present study we examined the cell cycle profiles of plk <dig> heterozygous mefs in comparison to wild-type mefs and found that the heterozygous mefs displayed a decrease in cells in g0/g <dig> and an increase in the number of cells in g2/m . these results suggest that plk <dig> haploinsufficiency may also lead to impaired progression through the cell cycle with the potential to lead to abnormal chromosomal alignment and segregation. plk <dig> haploinsufficiency and loss of heterozygosity have also been implicated in the development of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in mice and humans respectively  <cit> .

the main focus of the present study was to examine global changes in transcript profiles between plk <dig> wild type and heterozygous mefs. in order to accomplish this, we utilized independent cultures of asynchronously growing age matched plk <dig> wild-type and heterozygous mefs in three replicates. quantification and normalization of the data was performed using "the institute for genomic research"  tm <dig> microarray data analysis suite. normalization and filtering of the data was performed using the tigr microarray data analysis system  application. analysis of all microarray data sets for the different microarray experiments  were performed independently.

k-means clustering analysis was performed using tigr multiexperiment viewer . within each cluster, genes having a log ratio value greater than  <dig> or less than - <dig> on each microarray chip were identified. genes having a log ratio greater than  <dig> represented genes in the heterozygous mefs that have at least a two fold increase in gene expression. as the wild-type mefs was used as the control, genes with a log ratio greater than  <dig> were classified as up-regulated in the heterozygous mefs and genes with a log ratio less - <dig> represented genes in the wild-type mefs that have at least a two fold increase in gene expression or are down-regulated in the heterozygous mefs.

from the microarray data,  <dig> genes were identified as having at least a two-fold decrease in transcript levels in the heterozygous mefs when compared to the wild-type control , while  <dig> genes were identified as having at least a two-fold increase in transcript levels in the heterozygous mefs . we ordered these genes within each functional group based on the average fold difference between plk <dig> wild-type and heterozygous mefs. in order to test the validity of the microarray results we assessed transcript levels for plk <dig> and three arbitrary genes with at least a two-fold increase in expression by qualitative rt-pcr. a graphic representation of these results is shown in figure 2a. in confirmation of previously published results  <cit> , plk <dig> transcripts levels in the heterozygous plk <dig> mefs are at about 60% of the level seen in wild-type mefs. furthermore, prohibitin, wisp <dig> and sap <dig> are upregulated in the plk <dig> heterozygous mefs thus independently confirming their altered expression profile as identified by microarray results.

shown above are ninety-seven upregulated genes and nine downregulated genes in the heterozygous mefs. "fold change" is the change in transcript level in the heterozygous mefs relative to wild-type mefs as determined by microarray analysis. the "putative p <dig> sites" are as determined by mapper and is based on the first  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site. please note that forty-six downregulated transcripts and their corresponding gene were omitted from the table as they encode hypothetical proteins or have unknown cellular functions. all the microarray data has been deposited into the miame database under accession number e-mexp- <dig> 

the presumed major cellular function for each down or up-regulated gene was identified using annotation data from the pubmed database, and/or the online mendelian inheritance in man  database. furthermore, we utilized genmapp  <dig>  <cit>  and panther  <cit>  to identify global biological trends in our gene expression data. the few genes that were downregulated in plk <dig> heterozygous mefs functionally included genes involved in development and metabolism. far more genes were upregulated than were downregulated in the heterozygous mefs. these included genes with a spectrum of known functions such as cell cycle control, the dna damage response, dna repair, epigenetic modification, development, and transcription/translation. in particular, several key genes involved in p <dig> dependent pathways, rho signaling, wnt signaling and the proteasome were upregulated in the heterozygous mefs. several of these genes have been implicated in malignancy and are of particular interest given the increased rate of malignancy previously identified in plk <dig> heterozygous mice. this includes securin  which serves to prevent premature chromosome separation through inhibition of separase activity. securin is involved in several key cellular events including mitosis, cell cycle progression, dna repair and apoptosis. furthermore, securin  is upregulated in several malignancies and in particularly, pituitary adenomas  <cit> . casein kinase ii , a serine/threonine kinase is a positive regulator of wnt signalling pathway that is also upregulated in most cancers  <cit> . phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  is an upstream regulator of akt  <cit> , both of which are aberrantly regulated in many cancer types and as such are prime targets for intervention  <cit> , wisp <dig> overexpression has been implicated in cellular morphological transformation  <cit>  and hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> .

the observation that the expression levels of genes involved in p <dig> dependent pathways were altered, coupled with the known interaction of p <dig> with plk <dig>  and since changes in p <dig> levels, like plk <dig>  may also contribute to centrosome abnormalities  <cit> , led us to further analyze this result. we therefore analyzed the promoter region of both the up and downregulated genes utilizing the mapper search engine  <cit>  and found that the majority of these genes contained numerous p <dig> responsive elements within the first  <dig> kilobases upstream of the transcriptional start site. furthermore, several of these upregulated genes are known p <dig> targets  or affect the p <dig> transcriptional machinery .

the effect of ionizing and ultraviolet radiation on the plk <dig> transcript and protein profiles in mefs
the plks are known components of dna damage pathways, affecting levels and activity of a number of key proteins including p <dig>  chk <dig>  cdc25c and others. plk <dig> is known to interact with proteins involved in the response to dna damage including p <dig>  <cit> , cdc25c  <cit>  and chk <dig>  <cit> . this characteristic, coupled with the observation that many of the upregulated genes contain numerous p <dig> responsive elements within their promoter, led us to examine the effect of dna damaging agents on the levels of key genes involved in the dna damage response in the context of plk <dig> levels. wild-type and heterozygous mefs were exposed to  <dig> gy ir or  <dig> mj/cm <dig> uv and changes in transcript levels were analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. in response to ir, we found no significant difference in plk <dig> transcript levels between wild-type and heterozygous mefs . in contrast, upon exposure to uv, there is a striking difference in transcript profile levels of plk <dig> between plk <dig> wild-type and heterozygous mefs . initially, post exposure to uv, plk <dig> transcripts are undetectable in both wild-type and heterozygous mefs. interestingly two hours post uv exposure plk <dig> transcripts levels in the wild-type mefs returned to control levels and then subsequently increase to 40% greater expression, while no plk <dig> transcripts are detectable in the heterozygous mefs. unfortunately, we were unable to detect plk <dig> protein in these mefs with the commercially available antibodies. as our array results suggest that p <dig> activity may be increased in the plk <dig> heterozygotes, we were therefore interested in examining p <dig> protein levels. we found a sharp contrast between wild-type and heterozygous mefs, with levels of p <dig> protein expression substantially higher in the heterozygotes . these results would seem to suggest that the levels of p <dig> in the heterozygous mefs may be the result of dna damage that occurs as a result of genomic instability. we also examined p <dig> levels in these cells after exposure to dna damaging agents based on the differences found for plk <dig> transcript levels  <dig> hrs post exposure. in the case of uv we did not see any additional increase in the level of p <dig> protein compared to the plk <dig> wild-type and heterozygote controls. in contrast, the levels of p <dig> in the wild-type mefs increased to the heterozygote levels when exposed to ir. the levels were stabilized at close to maximal levels for these conditions and increased insignificantly. results displayed are the representative data from three independent experiments. we subsequently examined the levels of a number of known cell cycle control and dna damage response proteins. chk <dig>  which is known to aid in the maintenance of sustained g <dig>  g2/m arrest, and apoptosis by phosphorylating p <dig>  <cit> , was also at much higher levels in the heterozygous mefs pretreatment . upon exposure to uv or ionizing radiation the levels of chk <dig> were elevated in both wild-type and heterozygous mefs. we next examined the levels of p <dig>  a downstream effector and transcriptional target of p <dig> and found that the levels were increased in plk <dig> heterozygote mefs when compared to wild-type . consistent with this result, in our microarray data, p <dig> transcript levels were also upregulated  <dig>  times  in the plk <dig> heterozygous mefs. additionally, six hours post dna damage we observed a substantial increase in p <dig> levels in the wild-type mefs, while there was no further increase apparent in the heterozygous mefs post dna damage. the observation that p <dig> protein and transcript levels were elevated in the heterozygous mefs again corresponds with the aforementioned increased levels of p <dig>  furthermore, it is also consistent with the increased levels of cdk <dig> transcripts found in the heterozygous mefs . cdk <dig> binding to p <dig> target genes is known to correlate positively with transcriptional strength. cdk <dig> is recruited to the p <dig> locus during conditions of strong p <dig> transcriptional activation  <cit> . we found minimal differences in the detectable levels of cdc25c  and chk <dig>  prior to or post treatment.

the effect of uv induced dna damage on apoptosis and cell cycle profiles in plk <dig> mefs
as p <dig> is a major regulator of apoptosis we were next interested in determining whether the levels of apoptosis were higher in the plk <dig> heterozygous mefs. since we observed a large decrease in the level of plk <dig> transcripts in heterozygous mefs upon uv exposure and since uv is a more effective inducer of both p <dig> activity and apoptosis than ir  <cit>  we examined the levels of apoptosis after uv treatment. interestingly, we found no significant difference in the levels of apoptosis for wild-type and heterozygous mefs prior to or post treatment with uv . while we were surprised that there was no difference in the level of apoptosis between wild-type and heterozygous mefs, it is consistent with the elevated level of wisp <dig> mrna seen in the heterozygous mefs. wisp <dig> is known to attenuate p <dig> mediated apoptosis through the activation of pkb/akt anti-apoptotic pathways  <cit> . this results in the protection of cells from the late stages of p <dig> mediated apoptosis. additionally, while the cell cycle profiles of wild-type and heterozygous mefs were different without treatment, their respective responses to uv irradiation were similar with an overall increase in the sub g <dig> population post exposure .

senescence and p <dig> activity in plk <dig> mefs
in most cell types p <dig> is a potential key regulator of senescence growth arrest, the maintenance of senescence growth arrest and the initiation of the senescence response following dna damage  <cit> . in order to address the possibility that elevated p <dig> levels may be correlated with a senescent phenotype in the plk <dig> heterozygous mefs, we stained the cells for β-galactosidase activity from passages 2– <dig> . we found no evidence of increased β-galactosidase activity in the plk <dig> heterzoygous mefs relative to the wild type mefs; thus suggesting that the elevated p <dig> protein levels in the plk <dig> heterozygous mefs were not correlated with an increase in cellular senescence.

p <dig> accumulation and activity is regulated by post-translational modification of at least  <dig> sites via protein phosphorylation and/or other post-translational modifications  <cit> . as previously stated, the p <dig> protein levels are markedly increased in the plk <dig> heterozygous mefs compared to wild-type. it was therefore of interest to determine whether the increase in p <dig> levels was also accompanied by an increase in p <dig> activity. in order test this possibility we utilized an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  to measure p <dig> transcriptional activity in our plk <dig> wild-type and heterozygous mefs. interestingly, in agreement with the presence of p <dig> responsive elements in the genes that were upregulated in the array data, we observed a  <dig> fold increase in p <dig> activity in the heterozygous mefs .

we propose that the increased p <dig> protein levels and activity that occur as a result of plk <dig> haploinsufficiency may in turn contribute to the over-expression of numerous genes containing p <dig> responsive elements within their promoters . the function of these genes encompasses a spectrum of cellular activities including cell cycle control and the response to dna damage. the results suggest that one function of plk <dig> phosphorylation of p <dig> may be with respect to p <dig> protein stability and/or activity. in this scenario the possibility exists that this arises through a direct effect in which lower plk <dig> levels result in reduced phosphorylation of p <dig> by plk <dig> thus leading to an increase in protein p <dig> stability and activity. alternatively, the presence of supernumerary centrosomes seen in plk <dig> heterozygous mefs may lead to an increase in genomic instability and the induction of checkpoints to deal with the ensuing dna damage. very few targets for plk <dig> have been identified thus far. however, the possibility exists that the increased levels of p <dig> and phenotypic changes observed occur as a result of indirect consequences of plk <dig> haploinsufficiency and targeting of other substrates. for example, one known plausible indirect effect of plk <dig> haploinsufficiency could be through chk <dig>  plk <dig> both interacts with and phosphorylates chk <dig>  a key regulator of the dna damage response and p <dig>  <cit> . conceivably, reduced phosphorylation of chk <dig> as a result of lower plk <dig> levels may result in altered chk <dig> levels and/or activity towards p <dig> thus resulting in p53's increased stability or activity. this is consistent with the observation that chk <dig> levels are greatly increased in the heterozygous mefs and the observation that the cell cycle profiles of heterozygous mefs are altered.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results demonstrate that plk <dig> haploinsufficiency leads to changes in the levels of rna accumulation for a number of key cellular genes as well as changes in protein levels for several important cell cycle/dna damage proteins. the majority of the upregulated genes have numerous p <dig> responsive elements within their promoter regions, thus suggesting that plk <dig> haploinsuficiency directly or indirectly leads to an increase in p <dig> activity in mefs. further studies should reveal the nature of the relationship between plk <dig> levels, p <dig> and the down and upregulated genes found in plk <dig> heterozygous mefs.
