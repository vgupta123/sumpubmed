BACKGROUND
the nutritional value of soya-derived products is high since the amino acid profile of soy protein corresponds more closely to human requirements than most other plant proteins  <cit> . in recognition of this high quality, the us department of agriculture issued a ruling in  <dig> allowing soy protein to completely replace animal protein in the federal school lunch program  <cit> . soy proteins have also been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease  <cit>  and, in this context, the us food and drug administration has approved a health claim for the cholesterol-lowering effect of soy proteins  <cit> . other key benefits of soya derive from its high content of isoflavones which are thought to exert a range of biological effects against hormone-dependent diseases such as breast and prostate cancer, menopausal symptoms, cardiovascular diseases, and osteoporosis  <cit> . taken together, these reported health benefits, along with growing consumer preference for plant-derived food rather than meat, have led to an increasing demand for soy products  <cit> . however, in addition to these positive properties, soya does have one negative characteristic limiting its use in human nutrition. as is the case with other legumes, soya contains high levels of the α-galacto-oligosaccharides  raffinose and stachyose that are composed of one sucrose moiety and one or two galactose moieties, respectively. since mammals are deficient in the enzyme α-galactosidase , which hydrolyses the α- <dig>   <dig> linkages found in these sugars, α-gos are not digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract and reach the large intestine where they are fermented by the resident microbiota. the resulting production of fermentative gases can induce abdominal pain as well as the social embarrassment associated with flatulence  <cit> . such negative aspects reduce the acceptability of soy products as a major human food source  <cit> .

one means of avoiding this problem could be to remove α-gos from the raw agricultural products. this could be achieved by fermenting soya-derived products, such as soy milk, using food grade bacteria that are able to catabolize α-gos into digestible carbohydrates. lactic acid bacteria  have long been used in food processing, and some of these are able to produce α-gal, making them good candidates to fulfil this task  <cit> . this approach is promising for the manufacture of soy yoghurts since some lab are also able to reduce the concentration of the aldehydes responsible for the undesirable beany flavour of soy milk  <cit> . however, this strategy is limited to food products that are to be fermented by lab. for soya and α-gos-rich food products that are not intended to be fermented by lab, another method of reducing the quantity of gas-producing substrates would be to use lab as a vehicle for delivering α-gal to the small intestine, allowing the enzyme to hydrolyse undigested α-gos prior to their passage to the large intestine. in previous experiments, we selected the lactobacillus  fermentum crl <dig> strain for its high α-gal activity, which allowed it to degrade raffinose and stachyose in vitro  <cit> . following oral administration of live cells or cell-free extracts of this strain, we were able to detect a short-lived α-gal activity in the small intestinal chyme of conventional rats  <cit> .

the present study was designed to assess the efficiency of l. fermentum crl <dig> to reduce gas production in rats consuming α-gos. gnotobiotic rats which were monoassociated with clostridium  butyricum, a bacterial species known to produce large amounts of gas from carbohydrate fermentation, were first used as an animal model. in a second series of experiments, we investigated the effect of l. fermentum crl <dig> in a microbiological environment similar to the human gastrointestinal tract, using human microbiota-associated rats. in all the trials, l. fermentum crl <dig> was consumed as a bolus of live cells, and h <dig> excreted through breath and flatus was used as a biomarker of gas production in the gastrointestinal tract.

RESULTS
a model experimental system to assess the potential of α-gal-producing lactobacilli to improve α-gos digestion in rats
a model system was designed in order to assess the potential of l. fermentum-delivered α-gal to improve the digestion of α-gos in rats. this system made use of respiratory chambers to monitor gas excretion in gnotobiotic rats in which the microbiota was first simplified to a single strain of c. butyricum that produces h <dig> from α-gos fermentation . in these rats, the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by c. butyricum ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> cfu/g of faeces. initial experiments showed that administration of  <dig> ml of native soy milk with raffinose and stachyose levels of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm, respectively, did not significantly induce h <dig> emission in cb rats . therefore, native soy milk was enriched with various amounts of both α-gos to yield final concentrations of up to  <dig> and  <dig> mm of raffinose and stachyose, respectively. these were the concentrations that were then used for further studies. given that legumes contain around  <dig> %  α-gos , the amount of α-gos administered to rats corresponded to an intake of about  <dig>  g of legumes per rat. when cb rats received this enriched soy milk, they excreted h <dig> in expired air and flatus at up to  <dig> μmol/ <dig> g metabolic weight as shown in fig.  <dig>  in contrast, when rats received only peptone water, only a slight h <dig> emission, probably corresponding to background dietary fermentation, was observed. these observations suggest that h <dig> emission by rats receiving enriched soy milk is linked to their consumption of α-gos. this was confirmed by preparing soy milk in which α-gos were degraded using an exogenous α-gal prior to administration. in this case, a significantly lower  h <dig> excretion was observed than when rats received enriched soy milk, indicating that the high h <dig> excretion found with the latter treatment was due to the presence of the α-gos raffinose and stachyose from soy milk. nevertheless, α-gos-free soy milk induced a significantly higher h <dig> emission than peptone water . this was probably related to the presence of non-digestible but fermentable sugars, other than α-gos, that remained in the soy milk preparation after the α-gal treatment  <cit> .

α-gal-producing l. fermentum crl <dig> is able to remove flatus-generating α-gos both in soy milk and in the gastrointestinal tract of rats monoassociated with c. butyricum dsm10702
prior to assessing the potential of l. fermentum crl <dig> to allow the digestion of α-gos in soy milk and in the rat gastrointestinal tract, the effect of the strain alone was assessed in a group of  <dig> cb rats taken from the group of  <dig> rats tested above . the administration of l. fermentum crl <dig> to these rats had no effect on h <dig> excretion . h <dig> emission following this treatment was close to that observed previously in the same rats receiving α-gos-free soy milk. l. fermentum crl <dig> was used to ferment enriched soy milk whose raffinose and stachyose content was monitored during the fermentation process. this allowed the degradation of about  <dig> % of raffinose and stachyose . the resulting product administered to cb-b rats induced a slight h <dig> emission that was significantly lower  than that observed with α-gos-rich soy milk . this suggests that the degradation of α-gos by l. fermentum crl <dig> upon the fermentation of soy milk, prevented h <dig> excretion in rats thus confirming that this excretion was due to α-gos fermentation in rats. we then tested the potential of l. fermentum crl <dig> as a vehicle for α-gal in the gastrointestinal tract of rats. to do this, α-gos-enriched soy milk and a bacterial suspension of l. fermentum crl <dig> were simultaneously given to the cb-c rats. these rats showed an h <dig> excretion that was  <dig> % lower than when they received soy milk only , and that was similar to values obtained when they were given α-gos-free soy milk . analysis of bacterial populations from the faeces up to  <dig> h after the experiment revealed that l. fermentum crl <dig> was present and stable at  <dig> cfu per g of faeces. this indicates that l. fermentum crl <dig> was able to persist in the rats monoassociated with c. butyricum dsm <dig>  therefore, the observed α-gos digestion activity was possibly caused by  delivery of α-gal to the gastrointestinal tract following l. fermentum lysis, or  consumption of α-gos by a viable and colonizing l. fermentum population.

α-gal-producing l. fermentum crl <dig> also exerts a digestive activity in human microbiota-associated rats
in order to more closely mimic conditions in the human gastrointestinal tract, the animal model described above was modified so that the rat gastrointestinal tract was colonized by a human faecal microbiota. in this complex microbial digestive environment, rats fed with the α-gos-rich soy milk used for cb rats did not excrete significantly more h <dig> than rats given α-gos-free soy milk . this may have been the result of either a low level of gas-producing bacteria in the human microbiota used as an inoculum, or, more probably, from the activity of h2-consuming microorganisms  <cit> . trials with  <dig> ml soy milk with concentrations of raffinose and stachyose that were artificially increased 2- or 3-fold higher were performed. these trials showed that human microbiota-associated -rats administered with soy milk whose α-gos concentration was enhanced 3-fold, i.e.  <dig> and  <dig> mm raffinose and stachyose, respectively, exhibited h <dig> excretion levels of the same order of magnitude as those observed in cb rats . under these new conditions, the activity of l. fermentum crl <dig> was again assessed by coadministration of the strain with the α-gos-rich soy milk. this experiment showed that h <dig> emission was reduced by about  <dig> % compared with the α-gos-rich soy milk treatment , and this reduction attained statistical significance  <dig> h after feeding . monitoring of the l. fermentum crl <dig> population present in faecal samples showed that the population decreased 100-fold each day, indicating that, in contrast with the situation observed in cb rats, this strain was unable to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of hma rats.

discussion
the primary aim of this work was to assess the potential of lab to facilitate the digestion of soy α-gos through their α-gal activity. in this context, we have previously characterized α-gals from various lactobacilli, and one from l. fermentum crl <dig> appeared to be the most active  <cit> . the present work focused on assessing the ability of the α-gal producing l. fermentum crl <dig> strain to improve the digestibility of soy α-gos via its α-gal activity expressed either during soy milk fermentation or in the gastrointestinal tract of rats. using an animal model consisting of gnotobiotic rats monoassociated with an h2-producing c. butyricum strain, we first showed that depletion of α-gos from soy milk using l. fermentum crl <dig> as a starter greatly decreased sugar fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract of rats as shown by an important reduction in h <dig> excretion. we further showed that l. fermentum crl <dig>  when coadministered with soy milk rich in α-gos, greatly reduced h <dig> excretion derived from α-gos fermentation. this suggests that l. fermentum crl <dig> α-gal is active and available in the intestine to degrade α-gos. in our animal model consisting of gnotobiotic rats monoassociated with an h2-producing c. butyricum strain, we observed that l. fermentum crl <dig> was able to colonize the gastrointestinal tract. this means that at least a fraction of the l. fermentum crl <dig> inoculum survived the conditions encountered in the upper part of the gastro-intestinal tract and found an appropriate environment to multiply in the large intestine, despite the presence of a resident species. as a consequence, the observed reduction in gas production may have been caused either by the metabolic activity of l. fermentum crl <dig> in the small intestine or as a result of the strain colonizing the large intestine and competing there with c. butyricum for α-gos utilization. to assess which of these mechanisms applied, we went on to use another animal model consisting of rats harbouring a human faecal microbiota. this latter was expected to form a natural defence barrier  <cit> , preventing l. fermentum crl <dig> to settle in the large intestine. using this system, the α-gos amount previously administered to cb rats did induce a lower h <dig> emission than that monitored in cb rats. this may result either from a poor level of gas producing bacteria in the used human microbiota, or, most likely, from the activity of h2-consuming microorganisms such as methanogenic archeae, sulfatoreducing or reductive acetogenic bacteria. therefore, the α-gos amount administered to hma rats was increased  <dig> fold. this corresponds to an average intake of  <dig>  g of legumes which is a physiologically acceptable dose for rats. under these conditions, l. fermentum crl <dig> still improved α-gos digestibility although, as expected, it was unable to colonize the large intestine. this strongly suggests that the enzyme activity occurs in the small intestinal compartment. in further preliminary experiments to distinguish between l. fermentum crl <dig> α-gos utilization and delivery of α-gal activity by l. fermentum crl <dig>  we used another α-gal+ l. fermentum strain that is deficient in α-gos transport. interestingly, this l. fermentum strain exhibited an in vivo effect similar to that of l. fermentum crl <dig>  suggesting that the latter strain acts through delivery of α-gal to the small intestine rather than via α-gos utilization . this observation is consistent with a previous study in which we found that the majority of l. fermentum crl <dig> cells did not survive the duodenal portion of the small intestine, as has been found for another lab, lactococcus lactis  <cit> . in this latter work, a significant, although short-lived, α-gal activity was found in the duodenum of rats fed l. fermentum crl <dig>  it appears that this short life of α-gal is sufficient to allow digestion of the α-gos present in the diet, as shown by the present work.

the model presented here should allow further elucidation of both the mechanisms and the parameters that govern the expression of lab enzymatic activities in vivo. few other studies have been performed in this area. lactococcus lactis strains genetically engineered to produce lipase have been shown to be capable of alleviating a lipase pancreatic insufficiency caused by ligation of the pancreatic duct in pigs  <cit> . other studies have suggested that lab improve lactose digestion of dairy products in lactase-deficient individuals by delivery of β-galactosidase to the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . however, a recent systematic review stressed the variability found in these studies and the difficulty in drawing definitive conclusions on the positive effect of lab in lactase supplementation  <cit> . the α-gal host deficiency retained in the present model system is, in contrast to lipase and lactase deficiencies, constitutive in mammals; this model should therefore reduce inter-individual variation. furthermore, the animal model described here makes it possible to perform quick analyses. this will allow the effect of different parameters such as the influence of the lab vehicle  and of the mode of administration of lab to be studied.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that a given host enzyme deficiency can be supplemented by orally administered lab that produce this enzyme at high level. this type of work opens up the possibility of using lab vehicles for delivery of other digestive enzymes to the digestive tract. labs have great potential in this field. first, since these bacteria have long been ingested by man in fermented products, the mucosal digestive immune system has developed a tolerance to these bacteria, some of which are commensal  <cit> . furthermore, labs form a heterogeneous family of bacteria originating from various ecological niches. these bacteria therefore have a diverse range of enzymatic activities required for their adaptation to those niches  <cit> . finally, their designation as gras  by the us food and drug administration, positions them as particularly well-suited organisms for this type of application.
