BACKGROUND
adverse environmental factors, such as salt, alkali, and/or drought stresses greatly limit the growth and development of plants which are sessile on the ground. the soil salinity-alkalinity causes crop yield reduction which has become a serious problem for the securities of food supplies  <cit> . plants have evolved with complex molecular mechanisms to survive and to keep normal growth under stress conditions. as a result of rna sequencing profiles of wild soybean roots which were exposed to sodium bicarbonate   <cit> , a couple of transcription factor genes like hd-zip  <cit> , myb  <cit> , wrky  <cit> , nac  <cit> , bzip  <cit> , c2h <dig>  <cit>  and tify  <cit>  were identified as alkali stress-responsive genes. although lots of the previous studies have been reported about the roles of transcription factors in plant tolerance to salt or drought stress, little is known regarding their roles in alkali stress. therefore, a deep comprehending of the essential mechanisms of plant responses to alkali stress is urgently needed and will contribute greatly to cultivating alkaline-tolerant crop varieties by biotechnology.

in our previous rna sequencing study  <cit> , we identified an hd-zip gene from the wild soybean transcriptome. this gene is highly homologous with gmhdz <dig> of cultivated soybean  and encodes a putative homeodomain-leucine zipper protein. the hd-zip family is unique to the plant kingdom  <cit> . in a previous study, chen et al. identified  <dig> hd-zip family genes from g. max genome and this family can be phylogenetically classified into i, ii, iii and iv subfamilies  <cit> . hd-zip proteins have a conserved homeodomain followed by a leucine zipper in most members or a mekhla domain only in subgroup iv members  <cit> . homeodomain is a kind of dna binding domain involved in the transcriptional regulation of key eukaryotic developmental processes and it may bind to dna as monomers or as homo- and/or heterodimers in a sequence-specific manner. leucine zipper is consist of respective amino acid sequences on an idealized alpha helix revealed by a periodic repetition of leucine residues at every seventh position over a distance covering eight helical turns  <cit> .

the hd-zip protein family has been found in a wide variety of plant species, and many efforts have been undertaken to evaluate the functions of hd-zip genes. hd-zip i proteins mainly participate in responses to abiotic stresses and the regulation of organ growth and developmental process  <cit> . for example, the expression of oshox <dig> was strongly induced by salt stress, abscisic acid , and polyethylene glycol treatment , and weakly by cold stress in rice  <cit> . athb <dig> and athb <dig> were both strongly induced by abscisic acid  and water-deficit, and functioned as negative primary regulators of aba response in arabidopsis  <cit> . zmhdz <dig>  positively regulated drought and salt tolerance in both rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . hb <dig> from hd-zip subfamily i of medicago truncatula, was strongly induced by salt stress in root apices and played as regulator of root architecture and lateral root emergence  <cit> . however, there is little information about hd-zip i genes responding to alkaline stress.

bicarbonate stress, including adverse effects of na+, co32−, hco3− and high ph, also elicits negative impacts on plant growth and development. excessive ion of organic acids such as malate, succinate and citrate were accumulated under bicarbonate  stress, leading to inhibit growth of new root and shoot  <cit> . the oxidation/reduction-related genes also participate actively in reacting to environmental stimulation which always reflect on physiological indexes such as mda content and pod activity. chlorophyll content is also a standard to assess damage of basic cell structure in green plants under stress treatment.

in this study, we explored the functions of gshdz <dig> under alkaline and osmotic stresses. the data showed that there may be different molecular mechanisms and pathways between alkaline stress and osmotic stress and gshdz <dig> functioned as a regulator of bicarbonate stress, providing new evidences to fully understand the functions of hd-zip genes.

RESULTS
identification and bioinformatics analysis of gshdz4
in our preceding work  <cit> , we noticed that one wild soybean gene which is highly homologous with gmhdz <dig> gene of cultivated soybean was induced by alkaline stress. we designed this gene as gshdz <dig>  evolution analysis implied that gshdz <dig> belongs to a conserved δ subgroup of hd-zip i subfamily  <cit> . since gshdz <dig> was more significantly up-regulated than the other hd-zip i members in transcriptome profiling analysis of glycine soja roots treated by alkali stress  <cit> , it was chosen as a further research object in term of functional analyses in this study.

the full-length cdna of gshdz <dig> was isolated from glycine soja by using homologous cloning strategy. sequence analysis confirmed that gshdz <dig> contains an open reading frame  of 648-bp that encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of  <dig>  da and a theoretical pi of  <dig> . gshdz <dig> protein has a conserved homeodomain  and leucine-zipper domains   . the cdna sequence of gshdz <dig> shares high identity to several gene cds sequences downloaded from the genome database of glycine max in phytozome , the green plants genomic database.fig.  <dig> sequence analysis of gshdz <dig>  a

a blastp search at ncbi showed that gshdz <dig> shared 66 % sequence identity with glycine max gmhdz <dig>  and  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % with arabidopsis thaliana athb <dig> , athb <dig> , athb <dig> , respectively. one putative nls  motif was predicted to be located in the n-terminus by an online software predict protein  .

spatial and temporal expression patterns of gshdz4
in order to investigate the induced expression patterns of gshdz <dig> in the roots of wild soybean under 50 mm nahco <dig> stress, we carried out qpcr  analyses. under normal condition, the expression of gshdz <dig> kept on a relatively stable level during the whole day and no peak was found . however, its transcript level in roots was significantly up-regulated by alkaline stress in a relatively early period of 6 h after treatment .fig.  <dig> expression and functional analysis of gshdz <dig>  a and b

nevertheless, the expression of gshdz <dig> in leaves was also induced by alkaline stress and reached a peak at 1 h, but reduced to valley at 12 h after treatment . it is remarkable that the induced expression level of gshdz <dig> in roots was dramatically higher than that in leaves. the possible reasons for the strong response in roots might be that the plant roots are the exact region of stress perception and the organ directly exposed to stress damage, or the responsive mechanisms for gshdz <dig> expression in roots may differ to that in leaves  <cit> . whatever, these results suggest that gshdz <dig> is an alkaline-inducible gene and plays important roles in response tonahco <dig> stress in wild soybean.

in addition, the spatial expression of gshdz <dig> was also verified in eight main tissues using qpcr. gshdz <dig> was differentially expressed in all of the tested wild soybean tissues and organs, including young and mature leaves, young and mature stems, epicotyls, hypocotyls, root tips and flowers . the results indicated that, among the eight tissues examined in this study, gshdz <dig> exhibited the highest expression level in roots, consistent with its important role of stress resistance in roots. on the contrary, the gshdz <dig> transcript level in leaves especially in old ones was relatively lower, implicating that the diverse mechanisms and roles of gshdz <dig> in roots and leaves  <cit> .

gshdz <dig> is a nucleus-localized protein
sequence analysis showed that gshdz <dig> has one putative nls motif at the n-terminus and illustrated that gshdz <dig> may target to the nucleus. to affirm the prediction, the pbsk-gshdz4-egfp construct was used to investigate the subcellular localization of gshdz <dig> protein in onion epidermal cells through biolistic bombardment. the figures showed that the gfp signal was detected in the nuclei of the onion cells by pbsk-gshdz4-egfp construct . as the control, the egfp signal produced by pbsk-egfp construct was found throughout the whole cells . these results suggest that gshdz <dig> should be a nucleus-localized protein which is one of the basic characteristics of transcription factors.fig.  <dig> nuclear localization of gshdz <dig>  gshdz4-egfp fusion protein was localized in the nucleus  and the control was found throughout the cell 



gshdz <dig> lacks transcription activation activity in yeast cells
to exam whether gshdz <dig> performs trans-activation activity, gshdz <dig> were fused to a dna binding domain , and its ability to activate transcription of lacz and his <dig> reporter genes was determined. the ah <dig> yeast strain was transformed with either pgbkt7-gsdreb , or pgbkt <dig> , pgbkt7-gshdz <dig> . the ah <dig> yeast cells carrying one of the above plasmids grew equally well on sd/-trp medium containing x-gal. however, the positive control performed high galactosidase activity , nevertheless the cells transformed with pgbkt7-gshdz <dig>  or the negative control, exhibited no galactosidase activity  . at the same time, the yeast cells carrying the positive control plasmid pgbkt7-gsdreb grew well on sd/-trp-his medium but the cells with pgbkt <dig> or pgbkt7-gshdz <dig> did not, indicating that gshdz <dig> could not activate the reporter genes expression in yeast cells. it suggested gshdz <dig> may be a transcription repressor or co-activator requires the other plant transcription components.fig.  <dig> transcription activity analysis of gshdz <dig>  a the construct of pgbkt7-gshdz <dig>  b galactosidase  assay. c

overexpression of gshdz <dig> enhanced tolerance to hco3−, but not to oh−
in order to assess the function of gshdz <dig> in alkali stress, gshdz <dig> overexpression lines of arabidopsis were generated. as a result, the gshdz <dig> transgenic plants had similar germination rates with the wild type, although their germination rates showed a little bit of fluctuation in the first 3 days after imbibition . there was no difference found in growth between the overexpression lines and wt plants in the normal condition . and then, we compared the germinations and growths of transgenic lines with wt on 1/ <dig> ms medium supplemented with 6 mm or 7 mm nahco <dig>  under nahco <dig> treatment, the seeds from both gshdz <dig> overexpression lines and wt were capable of developing healthy cotyledons following seed coat breakage and radicle emergence  and the germination rate data showed no difference . however, after 8 days on the medium containing 6 mm or 7 mm nahco <dig>  the survival rates of transgenic lines were significantly higher than those of wt. the wt plants showed sensitivity to nahco <dig> treatments. in addition, on the 20th day after germination, the transgenic lines possessed much higher average percentage of seedlings with open and green leaves  than wt, and most seedlings of wt turned white and gradually died . however, among the three transgenic lines , # <dig> line demonstrated the higher survival rate and percentage of green leaves than # <dig> and # <dig>  these results indicate that overexpression of gshdz <dig> may reduce the damage of high alkaline stress on chlorophyll degradation and may enhance tolerance to nahco <dig> to maintain plant growth and development.fig.  <dig> overexpression of gshdz <dig> enhanced tolerance to nahco <dig> stress in germination stage. a transcription levels of gshdz <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis  and wt by rt-pcr. b nahco <dig> stress tolerance of gshdz <dig> transgenic arabidopsis . plant growth under normal condition and under nahco <dig> stress . c plant survival rates under nahco <dig> stress . values represent means of three biological replicates; error bars indicate sd. significant differences are denoted with one or two stars if p <  <dig>  or p <  <dig> , by student’s t-test



gshdz <dig> ox also enhanced plant tolerance to nahco <dig> stress at the seedling stage. 7 days after germinating, the seedlings of gshdz <dig> ox and wt were transferred onto 1/ <dig> ms medium supplemented with 0 mm, 6 mm or 8 mm nahco <dig>  the result showed that the growth and development of the wt plants were severely inhibited compared with those of gshdz <dig> ox plants under nahco <dig> treatments . gshdz <dig> ox lines had longer primary roots and more total weight than wt under alkaline stress , implying that gshdz <dig> may play an important role in root development and water retention to enhance plants tolerance to nahco <dig> stress.fig.  <dig> overexpression of gshdz <dig> enhanced tolerance to nahco <dig> stress in seedling and stocking stages of transgenic arabidopsis. a

we further investigated the tolerance of gshdz <dig> ox lines and wt to nahco <dig> stress at stocking stage. the 3-week-old soil-grown plants were irrigated with 125 mm nahco <dig> every 3 days for 2 weeks. the survey data showed that the transgenic plants demonstrated better stress tolerance to nahco <dig> than the wt . under normal condition, almost no difference was found in plant growth, the contents of total chlorophyll and malondialdehyde , and pod activity of the wt and three transgenic lines. however, in the present of 125 mm nahco <dig>  the total chlorophyll contents decreased in wt more than transgenic plants . these results give evidence of that gshdz <dig> ox reduces the damage of high alkaline stress on plants and alleviated chlorophyll degradation. as an indicator of oxidative damage, the content of mda generated during peroxidation of membrane lipids is often used under abiotic stresses  <cit> . thus, the mda contents were measured in the transgenic and wt plants under alkaline stress conditions and found that the wt accumulated obviously higher levels of mda than gshdz <dig> ox lines . since the formation of reactive oxygen species  in the cells can be promoted by most abiotic stresses and subsequently hurts the plants  <cit> , we postulate that overexpression of gshdz <dig> can probably inhibit the production of ros and/or can even clean the oxidative products to protect plants from membrane damage. to confirm this observation, we determined the endogenous pod activity. the data showed that pod activity of each gshdz <dig> ox line was higher than that of wt , meaning that transgenic plants have more ability to get rid of ros products and extra free radicals to protect cell structure from damage.

in the alkaline soil, it is hco3− and/or oh−-rich environment. for the sake of further investigating if hco3− or oh− or both can generate stress to the plants, the gshdz <dig> ox and wt plants were grown on the medium with 6 mm khco <dig> or the medium with ph <dig>  and ph <dig>  adjusted by koh. the results showed that all transgenic and wt plants had normal and similar growth on the medium with ph <dig>  and ph <dig>  adjusted by koh. however, on the medium supplemented with 6 mm khco <dig>  the growths of both wt and transgenic lines were greatly inhibited, whereas the transgenic plants had a little higher survival rates than the wt . furthermore, we observed that gshdz <dig> ox and wt seeds had similar germination rates on 1/ <dig> ms medium or 1/ <dig> ms medium supplemented with 6 mm khco <dig> or koh which was used to adjust the medium to ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , although the germination were delayed to some extent on the medium with 6 mm khco <dig> and the medium with ph <dig>  . to further investigate the effect of hco3− or oh− on plant survival and root growth, we grew the 7-day seedlings for 10 days onto the medium containing 8 mm khco <dig> or the medium with ph <dig> , ph <dig>  or ph <dig>  adjusted by koh. the data indicated that the ox and wt plants had similar survival rate and root growth on normal 1/ <dig> ms medium with ph <dig> , ph <dig>  or ph <dig>  but the ox plants had higher survival rate and much better root growth than the wt on the medium containing  <dig> or 8 mm khco <dig> , implicating that gshdz <dig> overexpression can promote plant tolerance to hco3−, but not oh−.fig.  <dig>

gshdz <dig> regulated the expression of the stress-relative genes under nahco <dig> stress
the alkaline-resistant phenotypes of the gshdz <dig> ox plants indicate that the expression of the stress response genes might be changed in the gshdz <dig> ox lines. to prove this possibility, we compared the expression levels of the representative stress-inducible genes  in wt and gshdz <dig> ox plants under abiotic stress. in the presence of nahco <dig> stress, these marker genes demonstrated much higher expression levels in the transgenic plants than the wt plants , confirming that gshdz <dig> positively regulates the resistance to nahco <dig> stress in plants.fig.  <dig> relative expression levels of alkaline stress-responsive genes in transgenic arabidopsis plants  under 50 mm nahco <dig> stress. a, b, c and d showed the expression of h

overexpression of gshdz <dig> decreased tolerance to osmotic stress in transgenic arabidopsis
since there is some evidence for cross-talk between signaling pathways which regulate different responses to alkaline and drought stresses  <cit> , we investigated and compared the drought-tolerant phenotypes of the gshdz <dig> ox lines and wt plants. under 325 mm mannitol stress, the seeds of gshdz <dig> ox lines had a slower pace of seed coat breakage and radical emergence than those of wt . in additionally, the seeds of gshdz <dig> overexpression lines were unable to develop healthy cotyledons after breakage of seed coats, especially # <dig> and # <dig> . the overexpression lines exhibited less open leaves as well as green leaves than the wt at the seedling stage . at the adult stage of the wt and transgenic plants, all plants were stopped watering for 10 days to make the soil dry entirely. as shown in fig. 9e, compared to the wt plants, gshdz <dig> ox plants became severely wilted and impaired after dehydration stress. together, the data indicate that overexpression of gshdz <dig> enhanced drought sensitivity.fig.  <dig> overexpression of gshdz <dig> enhanced sensitivity to osmotic stress. a

to further confirm our observation that gshdz <dig> plays a negative role in plant drought-resistant signaling pathway, we compared the relative expression of osmotic stress response genes  in the wt and gshdz <dig> ox plants. the result showed that there was no significant difference between wt and transgenic lines in relative expression levels of these genes, suggesting that gshdz <dig> may negatively regulate plant drought-resistance through the other pathways.

discussion
the saline and alkaline stresses are the main environmental stimulation limiting crop growth and leading to crop productivity reduction around the world  <cit> . thus, understanding the mechanisms of the plant responses to alkaline or bicarbonate stress, and excavating bicarbonate-resistant genes, will promote biotechnological efforts to cultivate crop plants with enhanced resistant to bicarbonate-rich conditions  <cit> . due to its strong resistance to alkaline and salt stresses, wild soybean is an ideal model for the research of the molecular mechanisms of bicarbonate and salt tolerances. a couple of transcription factors were found to be inducible in the transcriptome profiles of wild soybean roots which were treated with alkaline stress specifically. among these transcription factors, gshdz <dig> is one of highly inducible genes by alkaline stress  <cit> . they were proved to be diversely expressed in the process of alkaline stress response based on transcriptome profile analysis.

gshdz <dig> belongs to hd-zip protein family. the name is assigned based on its high homology with the sequences of g. max reported in previous study  <cit> . hd-zip family has four subgroups . in arabidopsis, hd-zip i genes play a part in response to abiotic stresses, aba, blue-light and de-etiolation  <cit> . hd-zip ii genes respond to illumination conditions  <cit> , shade avoidance  and auxins  <cit> . moreover, several hd-zip i subfamily members, like athb <dig> and athb <dig>  <cit> , hahb- <dig>  <cit> , mthb <dig>  <cit> , oshox <dig>  <cit>  and zmhdz <dig>  <cit> , were involved chiefly in plant responses to abiotic stresses. whereas, no any hd-zip i proteins from glycine soja have been verified and their physiological and biological functions have still unknown until now. in our study, a novel hd-zip i protein from subgroup δ, gshdz <dig>  was first identified from glycine soja and then was functionally characterized for its response and tolerance to drought and alkaline stress in transgenic arabidopsis plants.

as it was shown in fig. 1a, the amino acids in red frame were homeodomain and the following leucine residues marked with red points were leucine-zip domain. and the amino acids in red were nls sequences predicted by the online software. so gshdz <dig> has basic structures similar to homologs from glycine max and arabidopsis and may locate in nucleus as common transcription factors. sequence analysis affirmed that gshdz <dig> shared high structural homology with gmhdz <dig>  a soybean hd-zip protein. the results of spatial and temporal expression patterns suggested that gshdz <dig> was significantly induced by nahco <dig> stress treatment, espposecially in roots  but not in leaves . it is possible that the plant roots are the major signal perception organ of soil stresses, which induces gshdz <dig> to express in roots but not in leaves. in analysis of tissue-specific expression patterns, we found that gshdz <dig> had higher levels in young stem, hypocotyl and especially in root tip than the other organs of wild soybean. the transient expression and yeast assays of gshdz <dig> showed that the full-length gene could not activate any reporter genes, giving the possibility that gshdz <dig> may act as a repressor, or a co-activator requiring additional factors to fulfill its function. in cotton, ghhox <dig> is an hd-zip family gene and is related with cotton fiber elongation and contributes to promoting cell expansion during leaf growth  <cit> . ghslr <dig> interferes with the ghhox3-ghhd <dig> interaction and represses target gene transcription  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the transcriptional repression of bodenlos is controlled by an hd-zip transcription factor, hb <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, maize hd-zip, zmhdz <dig>  acts as transcriptional activators  <cit> .

in this study, we first characterized a wild soybean hd-zip i subfamily gene, gshdz <dig>  which can enhance plant tolerance to hco3−, but not oh− . as shown in the phenotypic data, the transgenic arabidopsis lines  showed significant tolerance to nahco <dig> at the germination, young seedling and mature seedling stages. although there was no difference on germination rates among all lines, the transgenic seedlings possessed higher survival rate, greater root length and heavier fresh weight than the wt, suggesting that overexpression of gshdz <dig> enhanced plant tolerance to alkaline stress. the current knowledge tells us that the alkaline stress in soil is mainly caused by high concentration of nahco <dig>  <cit> . our data showed that overexpression of gshdz <dig> resulted in enhanced plant tolerance to khco <dig>  but there was no obvious phenotype difference observed in koh stress treatment at germination and seedling stages. previous study suggests that under alkaline stress, plants might may activate much complicated responsive mechanisms in comparison with the plants under other stresses  <cit> . this may be led by the multiple toxicities of alkali stress, such as high ph, hco3−, co32−, and concomitant na+ in nahco <dig> solution  <cit> . as we still don’t know the exact function of gshdz <dig> in regulating alkaline stress, the further investigation is needed to dissect the mechanisms.

our gshdz <dig> transgenic arabidopsis showed not only phenotypically increased tolerance to hco3− stress, but also transcriptionally increased expression levels of stress-responsive genes, including nadp-me, kin <dig>  rd29b and h+-ppase. most genes modulated by bicarbonate are involved in metabolism, transcription and signaling transduction  <cit> . in the previous studies, v-h+-ppase, pepcase and nadp-me were reported to be induced by bicarbonate stress  <cit> . these enzymes play significant roles in intracellular ph regulation, assisting plant cells in dealing with the potential acidification of the cytoplasm under environmental alkaline stress condition. gshdz <dig> may modulate the process of bicarbonate stress tolerance through inducing the high expression of bicarbonate defense genes, such as nadp-me and h+-ppase directly. kin <dig> and rd29b are mainly induced by abscisic acid , cold and drought  <cit> . the accumulation of these proteins contributes to adjusting physiological conditions in plant cells  <cit> . the ability of gshdz <dig> to up-regulate kin <dig> and rd29b indicates that it may act as an important regulator in the process of bicarbonate resistance and participates in coordinating the expression of plant defense genes. however, growth regulation of plants in response to environmental stresses is extremely flexible and complex, and the complete molecular basis should be investigated further.

in order to defend the oxidative stresses, redox -related genes also play a key role in environmental stresses resistance, which can scavenge the reactive oxygen and then master the redox balance  <cit> . at the cellular level, alkaline stress causes the production of active o <dig> species, which result in the peroxidation of membrane lipid. mda is an end product of lipid peroxidation. our data showed that lower mda content and higher pod activity existed in the transgenic plants than in the wt , implying that the degree of membrane injury of transgenic plants was less than that of wt, consistent with the enhanced alkaline tolerance phenotype of transgenic arabidopsis.

similarly, the transgenic plants showed greater tolerance to bicarbonate stress than the wt . in the absence of nahco <dig>  there was almost no difference no matter in growth of plants or in contents of total chlorophyll among the wt and three transgenic lines. however, after supplement with 125 mm nahco <dig>  the total chlorophyll contents in wt plants decreased more than in transgenic plants . these results suggested that overexpression of gshdz <dig> reduced chlorophyll degradation and enhanced tolerance to bicarbonate in transgenic plants. however, the exact mechanism of gshdz <dig> in this aspect is still unknown.

to our surprise, the negative regulation of drought stress by gshdz <dig> was observed. phenotypic experiments at both germination and seedling stages revealed that transgenic plants showed more sensitivity to osmotic stress than the wt, implying that gshdz <dig> regulates alkaline and osmotic stresses by different ways. to better understand the molecular basis of the impaired drought stress tolerance of the gshdz <dig> transgenic plants, the expression patterns of the stress-related genes, such as p5cs, rd <dig> and rd29a, were investigated. these genes have been used as convenient markers for monitoring the aba and stress-responsive pathways in plants  <cit> . however, there was no significant difference observed in the experiment, implying that gshdz <dig> may not regulate response to drought stress via these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a novel hd-zip i gene, gshdz <dig>  from glycine soja. gshdz <dig> encodes a protein with conserved homeodomain-leucine zipper domain and acts as a positive regulator in alkaline  stress in arabidopsis. the overexpression of gshdz <dig> displays a significant tolerance to nahco <dig> stress in the seed germination, seedling growth and stocking stage. moreover, transgenic lines showing tolerance to khco <dig> but not to koh indicated that gshdz <dig> may play an important role in bicarbonate tolerance pathway. what is more interesting is that the overexpression of gshdz <dig> showed sensitivity to osmotic stress and did not regulate the marker genes in osmotic stress-relative pathways. our studies broaden our knowledge level about hd-zip i family gene functions, and complement the evidences which was developed in previous studies.
