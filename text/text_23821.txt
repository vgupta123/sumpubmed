BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing technologies have been widely used in biology research, such as in genome-wide identification of polymorphisms, transcription factor binding sites, methylation states, and transcript expression profiles  <cit> . with these ultra high-throughput sequencing technologies, massive amounts of short sequencing reads can be generated rapidly at low cost. for example, the solexa system from illumina can generate  <dig> m reads and  <dig> g bases  or  <dig> g bases  in a single run  <cit> . the large volume of data poses serious challenges for effective data analysis.

one of the most critical analysis tasks is to map the sequencing reads to reference sequences accurately and efficiently. general alignment tools such as blast  <cit>  and blat  <cit>  suffer from long running time. new dedicated algorithms such as eland , soap  <cit> , maq  <cit> , rmap  <cit>  and seqmap  <cit>  have been developed to achieve better mapping efficiency. among these algorithms, eland, maq and soap employ similar seed index and search schema, except that eland and maq create index for query reads and soap creates index for reference sequences. eland can handle up to  <dig> substitutions, while maq can handle up to  <dig> substitutions. rmap is mainly developed for handling mutations in 3' low quality region, but it lacks the sensitivity for leading sequence mutations. while these algorithms are effective in handling near-perfect matches, their mapping sensitivity, speed, and/or memory requirement suffer when handling simultaneous multiple substitutions and indels.

while many attempts have been made to improve sequencing accuracy, the next-generation sequencing platforms still suffer from significantly higher error rate when being compared to classical sanger sequencing. statistics on the number of wrong base calls at each base position of typical solexa reads showed that the sequencing error rates range from  <dig> % at the beginning of reads to  <dig> % near the end of reads, and may reach up to  <dig> % at the last base  <cit> . moreover, recent studies have revealed that genome variations like snps and small-scale indels are common in populations and play key roles in diseases as well as individual differences  <cit> . for example, in one of the extreme known cases, sequencing of ciona savignyi in a natural population revealed a snp heterozygosity of  <dig> % and average per-base indel heterozygosity of  <dig> %  <cit> . in human, somatic point mutation rates were found to be  <dig> times higher in 13% of sporadic colorectal cancers infected by min  tumors than in normal cells  <cit> .

thus, there is a need for a new mapping algorithm that can effectively handle simultaneous multiple substitutions and indels. here we present such a new algorithm, basic oligonucleotide alignment tool . evaluations on both real and simulation datasets revealed that boat has better performance than other existing tools.

RESULTS
boat can handle several substitutions and indels simultaneously using adaptive indexing and searching strategies . it is optimized for mapping single-end and paired-end solexa reads to a reference genome, but can also map sage, mpss and  <dig> reads. boat does not require that all reads have the same length. it calculates an e-value for each hit as mapping quality assessment and provides customizable post-mapping filters for further mapping quality control. boat can be run on most unix-like platforms such as linux and solaris as a standard unix/linux command line program. it supports multiple threads scheduling and can use cpu resources effectively on both desktop pcs and large-scale computer farm. both the source code and pre-compiled binary packages of boat are available for free download at http://boat.cbi.pku.edu.cn under gnu public license .

to evaluate and compare the performance of boat, we first mapped  <dig> , <dig> solexa reads generated in rna-sequence experiments  <cit>  back to the mouse genome  using boat  and four other existing programs, maq , rmap , seqmap  and soap . since all of these four programs support three mismatches within 33-mer full read length, we allowed up to three mismatches, including substitutions and indels, during the mapping. as shown in table  <dig>  boat achieved the highest sensitivity at less memory requirement and less or comparable time cost. for example boat used only 65% of execution time  and mapped  <dig> % more reads  compared to the second most sensitive program soap.

 <dig> , <dig> rna-seq profiling solexa reads were mapped to mouse whole genome with different programs. in this comparison, the maximum mismatch number threshold was set to  <dig> . the comparison was run on a local linux box with two intel quad-core  cpus and  <dig> g ram . to handle the physical memory limitation of some of the programs boat is compared to, reads were mapped against individual chromosomes sequentially. "time" shows the sum of the execution times, and "memory" shows the maximal memory usage among those runs.

further comparison on simulation data revealed more advantage of boat over other programs. here we used the same module proposed by maq  <cit>  to generate five million 33-mer simulated reads with  <dig>  mutations  from a two-million-bp region on mouse chromosome x. the simulated reads were then mapped back to the x chromosome. as shown in table  <dig>  boat achieved higher sensitivity  and precision  compared to other tools, having mapped about 30% more reads than the second best algorithm rmap, with moderate memory and time cost. as shown in supplementary figure s <dig>  the increase in sensitivity was especially prominent when the number of mismatches was high.

 <dig> , <dig> simulated reads were mapped to an original two-million-bp mouse chrx region on a local linux box with two intel quad-core  cpus and  <dig> g ram. all programs were tuned to maximize their capability for tolerating no more than five mismatches .

* we tried to run seqmap with up to  <dig> mismatches, but failed with out-of-memory error. so only  <dig> mismatches with  <dig> indel were allowed when running seqmap.

** as only a small part of the whole genome was used as reference sequence in this benchmark, the memory usage of soap is very low. however, when mapping to the whole human genome, at least  <dig> gb memory is required to run soap  <cit> .

boat provides flexible and friendly features. a comparison of its features against other tools is shown in table  <dig>  in addition to the default mode, boat supports a "quick mode" dedicated to identify nearly perfect match, achieving over 10-fold speed-up at the cost of ignoring hits with more than one mismatch. on the other hand, to better handle low-quality reads, boat supports a "3'-end trimming mode" to construct best local alignment instead of optimizing for the global alignment between the reads and the reference sequences. this is useful in dealing with sequencing reads with low-quality tail region or small rna analysis with adaptor included in the tail region. boat also provides an auxiliary program snpcall to identify snp sites based on mapped reads. to reduce potential false positives caused by sequencing errors, snpcall masks sites with low quality scores before performing snp calling. by applying snpcall with default criteria  to the simulated dataset,  <dig> %  true snps were recovered, a much higher recovery rate than that from maq's snp discovery pipeline  . this could be partly attributed to the fact that maq did not support identification of snps around indels in single-end reads  <cit> .

* soap provided a similar mode called "iterative alignment" by iteratively trimming base pairs at the 3'-end and redoing the alignment until hits are detected or the remaining sequence is too short.

CONCLUSIONS
benchmark based on both real and simulation datasets suggested that boat offered better sensitivity with lower memory requirement and comparable or lower time cost than other existing tools. effectively handling multiple substitutions and indels simultaneously could make full use of sequencing data. boat could be a valuable tool in functional genomic studies.
