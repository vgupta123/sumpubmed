BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  is a causative agent of reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disorders in pigs and had been firstly recognized in the usa in  <dig>  <cit>  and subsequently in europe in the early 1990s  <cit> . the prrsv genome contains nine open reading frames   <cit> . the orf1a and orf1ab code for proteins with apparent replicase and polymerase activities. four minor structural proteins gp <dig>  e, gp <dig> and gp <dig> are encoded by orf2a, orf2b, orf <dig> and orf <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the major structural proteins are an envelope glycoprotein , an unglycosylated membrane protein  and a nucleocapsid  protein, encoded by orfs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. prrsv shows a high degree of genetic variation  <cit>  and some antigenic heterogeneity  <cit> . based on genetic and antigenic characteristics, prrsv is divided into a european and north american genotype  <cit> . recently, orf <dig> and orf <dig> sequences of east european prrsv isolates were found to be of the european genotype, but group separately from all other european genotype sequences  <cit> . stadejek and colleagues proposed a division of the european genotype into three subtypes: a pan european subtype  <dig> and east european subtypes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . to our best knowledge, there is no information available concerning the pathogenesis of recent east european prrsv isolates. antigenic heterogeneity between european and north american prrsv strains had been described earlier  <cit> , however this issue remains to be determined towards new east european prrsv subtypes.

the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the pathogenesis and antigenic characteristics of a recently isolated east european subtype  <dig> prrsv isolate.

RESULTS
sequence information
the nucleotide sequences of orf2a,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and deduced aa  sequences were determined for the belarusian prrsv lena  and north american prrsv us <dig>  . all sequences were compared to the european reference strain lelystad and the north american reference strain vr- <dig> . phylogenetic analysis revealed that lena is a new east european subtype  <dig> prrsv isolate. compared to previously described subtype  <dig> belarusian isolates  <cit> , prrsv  showed between 87-96% and 90-98% identity for the gp <dig> and n proteins, respectively. the lena gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gp <dig>  m and n proteins were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> aa long. prrsv  as well as other previously described subtype  <dig> belarusian isolates had the lowest n protein size for the european genotype and the largest gp <dig> protein reported so far.

clinical findings
obvious clinical differences were observed between the animals inoculated with prrsv  and the animals inoculated with prrsv . prrsv -inoculated pigs showed a rapid disease evolution. anorexia and depression were seen in all animals from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi and periocular edema was observed from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi. body temperature and respiratory disease scores are summarized in figure  <dig>  at  <dig> dpi, seven pigs out of ten had already fever which lasted until  <dig> dpi ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> Â°c. coughing was observed in some animals from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi. four pigs died during the experiment; one at  <dig>  one at  <dig> and two at  <dig> dpi. out of six pigs inoculated with prrsv , only three animals showed anorexia and fever  at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. afterwards, temperature returned to normal, animals recovered and stayed healthy and alive until the end of the experiment. respiratory disorders were not observed in these pigs.

gross lesions, bacteriology and differential diagnosis
the results of the postmortem and bacteriological examinations of pigs inoculated with prrsv  are presented in table  <dig>  arcanobacterium pyogenes was isolated from lungs of one animal that died, and streptococcus suis was isolated from lungs of one animal that was euthanized. all pigs were negative for porcine circovirus  <dig>  influenza virus, parvovirus and enteroviruses.

-: a bacteriological investigation was not done.

viremia
viral titres in sera of prrsv -inoculated animals were first detected at  <dig> dpi in nine pigs out of  <dig>  at  <dig> dpi, all pigs had viremia which lasted until  <dig> dpi . the viral load in sera reached peak levels ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tcid50/ml at  <dig> dpi and  <dig>  to  <dig>  tcid50/ml at  <dig> dpi. a high viremia was observed until  <dig> dpi. in pigs inoculated with prrsv , viremia was detected from  <dig> dpi until  <dig> dpi. at  <dig> dpi only one pig out of six was still viremic with low viral titre . the viral titres in this group were significantly lower  than in prrsv -inoculated animals at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi.

prrsv titres in different samples
prrsv  was detected in nasal swabs from  <dig> dpi until  <dig> dpi and viral titres ranged from  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg to  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg. tonsillar scrapings collected from all seven animals at  <dig> dpi had prrsv titres ranging from  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg to  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg. at  <dig> dpi, five samples out of seven were positive with viral titres between  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg and  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg. at  <dig> dpi, three tonsillar scrapings out of five were prrsv positive with viral titres ranging from  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg to  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig> mg.

the results of virus titration of bal  fluids and pams  are represented in table  <dig>  high viral titres were already detected in bals and pams at  <dig> dpi. all bal fluids and pam samples were positive until  <dig> dpi. at  <dig> dpi, pams from only one pig were positive.

pig  <dig> died at  <dig> dpi, pigs  <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig> dpi. *: day of euthanasia. nd: not done.

high viral titres were detected in lungs , tonsils  and inguinal lymph nodes  until  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively.

serology 
all animals were serologicaly negative prior to inoculation and at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. six out of nine prrsv -inoculated pigs seroconverted at  <dig> dpi and antibody titres ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  log <dig>  from  <dig> dpi until the end of experiment all pigs were seropositive with antibody titres ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  log <dig>  in animals inoculated with prrsv , the course of anti-prrsv antibody titres did not significantly differ from that in prrsv -inoculated pigs.

serological cross-reaction 
all samples collected at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi were seronegative regardless of the prrsv used . three prrsv -inoculated pigs out of ten seroconverted at  <dig> dpi and seven more at  <dig> dpi. all seven pigs inoculated with the prrsv  were seropositive at  <dig> dpi. the overall difference among the homologous antibody titres of the three groups was not significant . all sera which were negative in the ipma with homologous antigens were also negative in the ipma with heterologous antigens. heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres  for antisera against prrsv  at all sampling time points. for antisera against prrsv  and prrsv , heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi  and at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi , respectively.

discussion
in the present study, prrsv was isolated from a belarusian farm with reproductive and respiratory failure. it was designated lena. the phylogenetic analysis revealed that prrsv  is a new east european subtype  <dig> prrsv isolate. the main purpose of this investigation was to study the pathogenesis and antigenic characteristics of prrsv .

to study the pathogenesis, ten 6-week-old conventional pigs were inoculated with prrsv . a fever, lasting for several weeks, and a range of respiratory and systemic clinical signs together with gross lesions such as severe fibrinous pleuropneumonia, pericarditis and peritonitis were observed, with four out of ten animals dying within three weeks post-inoculation. the clinical and pathological picture and high mortality are similar to what is seen in the field in belarus . a comparison of the findings obtained with prrsv  with those obtained with other prrsv strains revealed similarities with some highly pathogenic american strains  <cit> . fever, prolonged viremia and co-infection with bacterial pathogens are prominent findings common to all of them. in this study, the viremia lasted for  <dig> weeks. as previously described for other prrsv strains  <cit> , antibodies produced early in infection were not effective in virus clearance. a good correlation was found between the extent of viremia and viral titres in nasal and tonsillar secretions and tissues.

the highest prrsv  titres in sera in our investigation ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tcid50/ml at different dpi. in the present study  and in most previous studies, the highest prrsv titres ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> tcid50/ml. to our knowledge, only few prrsv strains had been reported to cause abnormally high viremia   <cit> . however, the animals used in those studies were younger  than in present experiment and in most studies only a small number of pigs had high prrsv titres. two younger pigs  which were inoculated with prrsv  had also higher viral titres in sera,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tcid50/ml .

the severity of the observed clinical signs is most probably not due to a single direct effect of prrsv . secondary infections with other pathogens will have played an important role in the exacerbation of clinical signs. indeed, in the present study arcanobacterium pyogenes and streptococcus suis were isolated from lungs of two pigs. it seems that prrsv  infection paves the way for other pathogens. co-infections of certain prrsv strains with arcanobacterium pyogenes as well as streptococcus suis had been shown to increase the severity of the disease in pigs  <cit> . damaging local respiratory macrophages potentially negatively affects the immune defense and allows bacteria to grow and to cause pathology and disease  <cit> . pulmonary intravascular macrophages  are thought to be very important in the clearance of circulating blood-borne bacteria in pigs  <cit> . the detrimental effects of prrsv on pims have been demonstrated before and are considered as factors for the increased susceptibility to secondary infections  <cit> . the severity of disease caused by prrsv  as a single agent should be verified in gnotobiotics.

the appearance of new highly virulent prrsv strains and absence of effective diagnostic procedures and vaccines create a favorable environment for the emergence of devastating outbreaks. pivotal examples are the recent atypical prrsv outbreaks in china and vietnam  <cit> . sensitive and specific serological tests are important tools to control prrsv. to characterize the antigenic heterogeneity between east european subtype  <dig> lena, european subtype  <dig> lelystad and north american us <dig> strains, sets of antisera were tested in ipmas with homologous or heterologous viruses as antigens. although the three sets of antisera reacted with all strains, the homologous antibody titres were always higher than the heterologous ones. the antigenic difference between the reference european strain lelystad and lena was similar to that between lelystad and us <dig>  thus, east european subtype  <dig> lena, european subtype  <dig> lelystad and north american us <dig> prrsv strains do share common antigenic determinants that induce production of antibodies reactive with the heterologous strains, but there are clear antigenic differences.

since all present commercial kits for serological diagnosis are based on antigens belonging to european subtype  <dig> and north american prrsv, it can be assumed that the observed heterogeneity might affect the accuracy of serological assays in geographical regions where east european subtype  <dig> prrsv strains circulate. therefore, it is of major importance to validate the sensitivity of the current methods for serological prrsv diagnosis in these regions.

CONCLUSIONS
lena is a highly pathogenic east european subtype  <dig> prrsv, which differs from european subtype  <dig> lelystad and north american us <dig> strains at both the genetic and antigenic level.
