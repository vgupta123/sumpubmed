BACKGROUND
biohydrogen has great potential as a non-polluting, non-fossil fuel which can be produced at the point of end use without the release of greenhouse gases. the most efficient h2-generating catalysts are the hydrogenases which are present in several microorganisms including photosynthetic microalgae chlamydomonas reinhardtii. hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that reversibly catalyse the reaction: h2↔2h++ 2e-. there are three classes of hydrogenases: ,  and -cluster-free hydrogenases  <cit> . the  hydrogenases mainly catalyse the reduction of protons to yield dihydrogen with high efficiency. they are irreversibly inactivated by oxygen. c. reinhardtii is a eukaryotic green alga which contains two monomeric  hydrogenases: hyda <dig> and hyda <dig>  <cit> . both proteins are encoded by nuclear genes. the hyda <dig> gene encodes a protein that is 74% similar and 68% identical to hyda <dig>  hyda <dig> mediates a light-driven hydrogen evolution following anaerobic adaptation of the algae  <cit> . the structure of the hyda <dig> h-cluster is composed of a -centre bridged through a cysteine amino acid to an unusual 2fe-centre. unlike many other  hydrogenases, hyda <dig> does not have any  <dig>  electron transfer domains and is directly reduced by a  ferredoxin  <cit> . the specific function of hyda <dig> is not known. two maturation proteins, hydef and hydg, are required for the assembly of active hyda <dig>  <cit> . homologous expression of hyda <dig> leads to a low yield of active enzyme  <cit> . heterologous expression of hyda <dig> has been previously performed in clostridium acetobutylicum using endogenous maturation enzymes  <cit>  and in escherichia coli using a heterologously expressed maturation system  <cit> . the former experiments using c. acetobutylicum resulted in the purification of  <dig>  mg of hyda <dig> per liter of culture with hydrogen evolution rates of  <dig> μmol h <dig> min- <dig> mg- <dig>  <cit> . the opposite situation appeared with the e. coli expression system which resulted in a higher amount of enzyme  but with hydrogen evolution rates of  <dig> μmol h <dig> min- <dig> mg- <dig>  <cit> .

it is known that many organisms show particular preferences for one of the several codons encoding a given amino acid. a rare codon is defined as used by an organism at a frequency lower than  <dig> %. rare codons are capable of causing qualitative and quantitative expression difficulties  <cit> . in order to overcome these difficulties, we decided to search for organisms having not only a hyd maturation system, but also low rare codon usage rates for hyda <dig>  we first analysed the rare codon usage rate of hyda <dig> in different organisms carrying demonstrated or putative homologues of hyda <dig>  hydef and hydg. the closest match in codon usage between hyda <dig> and a possible host organism for expression of the protein was obtained with the bacterium shewanella oneidensis. s. oneidensis is a facultative anaerobe that can be easily and rapidly grown, and which possesses a large and diverse set of metalloproteins. it exhibits extensive respiratory versatility and can use organic, inorganic or metallic substrates during anaerobic respiration. the whole s. oneidensis genome has been sequenced  <cit> . this has shown that s. oneidensis possesses  and  hydrogenases, encoded by hyda  and hyab . global transcriptome analysis of s. oneidensis exposed to different terminal electron acceptors by beliaev et al.  <cit>  revealed that the  hydrogenase gene  is expressed under thiosulfate-respiring conditions and no induction was observed under fe, nitrate, fumarate, tmao and dmso-respiring conditions. the physiological significance of hyda gene induction in the presence of thiosulfate is not known.

in the present study, hydrogen formation by c. reinhardtii hyda <dig> expressed in s. oneidensis strain as <dig>  and grown in anaerobic conditions with six different substrates was measured, showing that s. oneidensis maturation enzymes are able to mature heterologously expressed  hydrogenase. in contrast to the transcriptome analysis by beliaev et al.  <cit> , we observed a significant increase of hydrogen formation due to the presence of the s. oneidensis  hydrogenase  with three substrates , dimethylsulfoxide  and disodium thiosulfate), compared to anaerobic conditions in the presence of other added respiratory substrates. this may be due to post-transcriptional regulation of s. oneidensis  hydrogenase synthesis.

after purification,  <dig> –  <dig> μg of catalytically active hyda <dig> were obtained from 1-liter culture  with specific activities of approximately  <dig> μmol h <dig> min- <dig> mg- <dig> under tmao, thiosulfate or dmso-respiring conditions. the enzyme contained six atoms of iron per molecule of protein, thus we can conclude that maturation was homogeneous and complete.

the plasmids used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  all the constructions were performed in e. coli  and then used to electrotransform s. oneidensis.

plasmid pbbr1-mcs <dig>  <cit>  was used for c. reinhardtii hyda <dig> cloning under control of lac promoter. expression under this promoter is repressor-independent  and is regulated only by glucose repression-derepression.

to construct pbbr1-mcs <dig> n-terminal strep tag ii, two complementary dna primers, tagf 5'-cggaggacgtttatggctagctggtcccacccgcagttcgaaaa gatcgaagggcgca-3'and tagr 5'-agcttgcgcccttcgatcttttcgaactgcg ggtgggaccagctagccataaacgtcctccggtac-3' were hybridizated, phosphorylated and cloned in kpni-hindiii sites of pbbr1-mcs <dig>  <cit> . tagf contains a ribosome binding site , a start codon, strep-tag ii and factor xa dna sequences. to construct pbbr1-mcs <dig> c-terminal strep tag ii, two complementary dna primers, tagfc 5'-tcgactggagccatccgcaatttgaaaaataag-3' and tagrc 5'-gatccttatttttcaaattgcggatggctccag-3' were hybridized, phosphorylated and cloned in sali-bamhi sites of pbbr1-mcs <dig>  <cit> . tagfc contains a strep-tag ii and a stop codon sequences.

electrotransformation of s. oneidensis was performed as previously described  <cit> , resulting in the strain as52a1n when as <dig> was transformed with pbbr-hyda1n and in the strain as52a1c when transformed with pbbr-hyda1c.

hydrogenase purification
all the purification steps were carried out under a purified nitrogen atmosphere, in a glovebox  maintained at <  <dig> ppm o <dig>  after  <dig> h of growth, the bacteria were recovered by centrifugation . the pellets were resuspended in breaking buffer  glycerol,  <dig> mm na-dithionite,  <dig>  nm avidin,  <dig> mm pmsf,  <dig> μg/ml dnase,  <dig> μg/ml rnase). cells were broken using a french pressure cell  and centrifuged . the supernatant was transferred to a q-sepharose ff  <dig> ml column  equilibrated in  <dig> mm tris/hcl,  <dig> mm na-dithionite at ph  <dig> . strep-tagii-hyda <dig> was eluted with a nacl gradient , and elution of the active fraction occurred at  <dig> mm nacl. the second purification step was affinity chromatography on a  <dig> ml gravity flow strep-tactin sepharose column as described by the manufacturer . strep-tag ii hyda <dig> was detected after gel electrophoresis and western blotting using strep-tag ap detection kit . amido-black and bradford assays were used to measure hydrogenase concentration. the assays were performed as described in references  <cit>  and  <cit> , respectively.

iron quantitation assay
iron concentration measurements were performed using a previously described atomic absorption method  <cit> , and the colorimetric method of doeg and ziegler  <cit> .

software
a short perl/tk script was written to obtain data on rare codons: upon providing the ncbi gene number and the kazusa codon usage database organism name, the script forwards the queries to the relevant databases, compiles the rare codons usage information and displays the gene with rare codons colored differently and a summary of the rare codons usage. the script is available as open-source software at: .

RESULTS
rare codons analysis
hyda <dig> rare codons were searched for in various organisms using a software that compares genes sequences from ncbi with the codon usage data from different genomes of kazusa dna research institute . rare and very rare codons were defined as used by an organism at a frequency lower than  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively .

a e. coli has no putative homologues of c. reinhardtii hyda <dig>  hydef and hydg, but was previously used for hyda <dig> heterologous overexpression. gene number was found within the following reference: , organism name was found within reference: . the script is available as open-source software at: .

the gene sequence of c. reinhardtii hyda <dig>  was compared with codon usage data from organisms which possess putative homologues of c. reinhardtii hyda <dig>  hydef and hydg and from e. coli, which was previously used to synthesize hyda <dig> but has no putative homologues of c. reinhardtii hyda <dig>  hydef and hydg.

phyla represented are: 1) the gram negative bacteria: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , desulfovibrio desulfuricans and d. vulgaris , e. coli, s. oneidensis  and thermotoga maritima ; 2) the gram positive bacteria: clostridium botulinum, c. difficile, c. perfringens, c. tetani, c. thermocellum and thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis ; and 3) protozoan:trichomonas vaginalis . it must be noted that hyda <dig> presents less rare codons in gram negative than in gram positive bacteria. the best match was obtained with s. oneidensis .

heterologous expression of crhyda1
the hyda <dig> producing strains of s. oneidensis as52a1n and as52a1c were constructed by electrotransforming the host strain s. oneidensis as <dig>   <cit>  with pbbr-hyda1n and pbbr-hyda1c respectively . pbbr-hyda1n is a pbbr1-mcs <dig> derivative carrying n-terminal strep tag ii hyda <dig> from c. reinhardtii and pbbr-hyda1c is a pbbr1-mcs <dig> derivate carrying a c-terminal strep tag ii hyda <dig> gene from c. reinhardtii. the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of hyda <dig>  which act as transit peptide  <cit>  were truncated. the pbbr1-mcs <dig> vector is a broad host range vector which has been tested and found to replicate in  <dig> gram negative bacteria  <cit> . after cell breakage using a french pressure cell and subsequent centrifugation, n-terminal strep-tag ii-hyda <dig> was detected in the cell-free extract, while c-terminal strep-tag ii-hyda <dig> was mostly found in the cell-debris pellet . it should be noted that no hydrogenase catalytic activity was detected in the pellet.

in c. acetobutylicum it was reported that after sonication, the n-terminal strep-tag ii-hyda <dig> was mostly found in the postsonication pellet, while the c-terminal strep-tagii-hyda <dig> was exclusively detected in the supernatant  <cit> . thus, the solubility of the tagged protein is most likely influenced by the tag position and by the host strain chosen for the expression. the occurrence of insoluble c-terminal strep-tagii-hyda <dig> protein could be due to non-specific interactions between hyda <dig> and the host bacterium proteins.

hydrogen evolution from s. oneidensis cells anaerobically grown in the presence of various respiratory substrates
s. oneidensis uses oxygen as final electron acceptor during aerobic respiration and various organic, inorganic or metallic substrates during anaerobic respiration. optimal conditions for synthesis of active hydrogenases in s. oneidensis were investigated.

the s. oneidensis strain as52a1n  was grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate, thiosulfate, fumarate, tmao, fe or dmso as substrates for anaerobic respiration. no hydrogenase activity was detected in extracts of cells grown aerobically . under anaerobic conditions, and in the absence of any externally added substrates, h <dig> evolution activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmole h <dig> min- <dig> ml- <dig> for od <dig> =  <dig> was measured for strain as52a1n . hydrogen formation was approximately the same using fumarate, nitrate or ferric citrate for the strains as52a1n, as <dig>  and as <dig> . we observed a significant increase of hydrogen evolution for the strains as52a1n and as <dig> grown in presence of tmao, thiosulfate and dmso . no hydrogen was detected after exposing the cells to air for  <dig> minutes . insignificantly small amounts of hydrogen were detected from the Δhyda strain  under dmso-, tmao- or thiosulfate-respiring conditions , showing that under these conditions, hydrogen evolution is only due to the presence of the  hydrogenases . no hydrogen was detected in experiments using the ΔhydaΔhyab strain  . it should also be noted that strain as52a1n produces about  <dig> times more hydrogen compared to the as <dig>  strain of s. oneidensis using dmso, tmao or thiosulfate as substrates for anaerobic respiration .

values are: result ± standard deviation .

purification and characterization of crhyda1
s. oneidensis strain as52a1n was used for the production of strep-tagged hyda <dig>  three substrates for anaerobic respiration were chosen for cell growth: tmao, dmso and thiosulfate. the purification procedure, which involves anion exchange and affinity chromatographies, was performed as previously described by girbal et al.  <cit> , except that during the stepwise elution from q-sepharose, the algal hydrogenase eluted at  <dig>  m nacl. as shown in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  strep-tagged crhyda <dig> was synthesized as an active enzyme using dmso, tmao or thiosulfate for cell growth. after purification on a strep-tactin column,  <dig>  –  <dig>  mg of pure algal hydrogenase was isolated from  <dig> liter of culture  . hydrogen evolution rates of about  <dig> μmol h <dig> min- <dig> mg- <dig> protein, were measured using a hydrogen electrode in the presence of reduced methylviologen as the electron donor . iron quantitation of hyda <dig> anaerobically expressed in s. oneidensis as <dig>  was done, showing in all cases the presence of  <dig> fe atoms/molecule of protein . interestingly, the hydrogen formation rate of purified hyda <dig> expressed in the wild type strain  of s. oneidensis under dmso-respiring conditions was about  <dig> times lower  and only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  atoms of iron were found per molecule of hydrogenase. this result may indicate the preferential maturation of the host  hydrogenase by so hydefg genes. as a consequence the proper expression of crhyda <dig> in s. oneidensis needs to be performed in the absence of the endogenous  hydrogenase.

discussion
shewanella oneidensis is a metabolically versatile bacterium that can use a diversity of organic compounds and metals to obtain the energy needed for its growth and survival  <cit> . it is a facultative aerobic gram-negative bacterium, related to e. coli. the tools and techniques that were developed over the past  <dig> years for e. coli are compatible with s. oneidensis. in addition, the ability of shewanella to tolerate oxygen allows easy genetic manipulation in contrast to strict anaerobic organisms.

the results of codon usage analysis of hyda <dig> are consistent with an eubacterial origin of this enzyme  <cit> . three of the four best codon usage matches between hyda <dig> and a possible host were obtained with eubacteria which are closely related in phylogenetic trees:d. desulfuricans, e. coli and s. oneidensis.

it is known that the regulation of bacterial hydrogenase gene expression is exerted mainly at the transcriptional level  <cit>  and responds to four major types of signals: h <dig>  o <dig>  nickel ions, and the electron donors together with available acceptors. in our work, the synthesis of s. oneidensis  hydrogenase or exogenously expressed hyda <dig> of c. reinhardtii was observed using dmso, tmao and thiosulfate as respiratory substrates during anaerobic cultivation. this induction is intriguing since, under such growth conditions, one could anticipate that cells do not need an additional respiratory pathway, such as proton reduction by hydrogenase, in order to drain off excess of electrons. no hydrogen production was observed during aerobic respiration. this fits with the well known observation that enzyme complexes that are sensitive to the presence of oxygen are usually not expressed in an aerobic environment.

during our studies of hydrogen evolution from s. oneidensis strains grown anaerobically in the presence of various respiratory substrates, we observed the absence of hydrogenase activity with fe, nitrate and fumarate. in contrast, under tmao-, thiosulfate- or dmso-respiring conditions a significant increase of hydrogen formation was detected due to the presence of the  hydrogenases . one may assume that putative  hydrogenase operon in s. oneidensis encodes maturation enzymes which are expressed and active under tmao, dmso and thiosulfate growth conditions, since mature crhyda <dig> or sohyda is produces under these conditions and not under nitrate, fumarate and fe conditions. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that the maturation enzymes of s. oneidensis  are capable of activating crhyda <dig> in a cell-free system from e. coli  <cit> . the disagreement with the transcriptome studies conducted by beliaev et al.  <cit>  concerning sohyda could be due to post-transcriptional regulation of s. oneidensis  hydrogenase synthesis.

it was previously shown that s. oneidensis can be electrotransformed directly by the puc-type universal vectors for e. coli  <cit> . in this study, vector pbbr1-mcs <dig> carrying the hyda <dig> gene of c. reinhardtii was used to electrotransform s. oneidensis strains and it was found to replicate in this bacterium.

using c. acetobutylicum, girbal et al.  <cit>  isolated about  <dig>  mg of algal hydrogenase per liter of culture with hydrogen evolution rates of  <dig> μmol h <dig> min- <dig> mg- <dig>  similar amounts of the protein were obtained for hyda <dig> isolated from cultures of c. reinhardtii and scenedemus obliquus  <cit> . heterologous expression of hyda <dig> in e. coli resulted in a higher amount of enzyme , but required a heterologously expressed maturation system and yielded a low rate of hydrogen evolution  <cit> . in s. oneidensis  <dig>  –  <dig>  mg of active hyda <dig> per liter of culture  was obtained under tmao, thiosulfate or dmso-respiring conditions. heterologous expression in s. oneidensis of another metalloprotein, cytochrome c <dig> from d. vulgaris miyazaki f, yielded  <dig> mg of protein per liter of culture, compared with  <dig>  mg per liter obtained by homologous expression  <cit> . these results confirm that s. oneidensis is a user-friendly system for heterologous expression of metalloproteins, including hydrogenase.

CONCLUSIONS
the present work shows that s. oneidensis heterologous production system appears more efficient than that of c. acetobutylicum, for matured  hydrogenase expression. the specific activities of purified strepii-tagged c. reinhardtii hyda <dig> expressed in s. oneidensis are higher than those of crhyda <dig> expressed in e. coli . the purified hyda <dig> is fully matured and homogeneous in that it bears the predicted full complement of iron . hyda <dig> isolated from cultures of c. reinhardtii contained  <dig> fe atoms/molecule  <cit> , while no result on this subject was published concerning hyda <dig> expressed in c. acetobutylicum  <cit>  or in e. coli  <cit> .

heterologous expression of algal  hydrogenase in s. oneidensis, a bacterium which is easily manipulated genetically, offers great potential to facilitate enzymatic studies of the  hydrogenases as well as investigations of their maturation processes.
