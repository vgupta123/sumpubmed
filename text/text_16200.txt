BACKGROUND
similar to most diphyodont mammals, humans have a deciduous  set of  <dig> teeth and a permanent set of 28- <dig> teeth. there are two types of permanent teeth, successional teeth, which replace primary teeth, and additional teeth , which develop behind the deciduous dentition without a primary predecessor. the successional teeth arise from the extension of the dental lamina on the lingual aspect of the deciduous teeth, and additional molars bud off from the posterior extension of the dental lamina. the number of additional molars varies among mammals. there are three additional molars in each quadrant in humans: the first molar , second molar  and third molar . m <dig> shows more evolutionary variation in morphology, size, number  and location. moreover, the process of additional molars from initiation to final eruption in humans takes a long time, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  years in different individuals.

the detailed early morphogenesis patterns of additional molars in diphyodont mammals remained unknown until very recent observations in the ferret , which has a heterodont and diphyodont dentition, very similar to humans except with only two additional molars  in each quadrant. this recent work has shown that the first additional molar buds off from the posterior-free end of the primary dental lamina, in contrast to successional teeth budding off from the secondary dental lamina  <cit> . we recently uncovered similar patterns during early diphyodont morphogenesis in chinese miniature pigs  <cit> , suggesting that they are evolutionarily conserved in most diphyodont mammals. this sequential initiation in the mandible ramus related to the specific tooth development stage of additional molars in miniature pigs further indicates that dental lamina without disruption may play a key role during the morphogenesis of additional molars  <cit> . our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling tooth development is mostly obtained from studies in mice, which have only one set of non-replaced dentition, different from humans. for this reason, the molecular mechanisms of controlling the spatiotemporal initiation patterns of additional molars, the role of dental lamina in additional molar morphogenesis and the variation of fate determination between successional and additional teeth in diphyodont mammals remain largely unknown.

a diphyodont mammal resembling humans is required for fully understanding the morphogenesis and odontogensis of additional molars. increasing evidence indicates that the miniature pig, a typical diphyodont mammal that also has three additional molars in each quadrant , could serve as an excellent pre-clinical alternative experimental model for studying tooth development  <cit> . recently, the porcine genome project was completed  <cit>  and the genome sequence of the wuzhishan miniature pig published  <cit> . we have identified the stage-specific differential gene expression profiling and functional network during early morphogenesis of successional tooth development and its primary counterpart in miniature pigs  <cit> . these advances provide the necessary tools and expertise for dissecting developmental mechanisms between the secondary teeth and additional molars.

here, the miniature pig serves as a large model animal to elucidate the relationship between morphogenesis and gene expression during the cascade initiation of additional molars. using deep sequencing methods and microarray, we have profiled the differential transcript expression and functional networks during morphogenesis of additional molars in miniature pigs. we also have identified the coding and long non-coding transcripts using cnci and annotated transcripts through mapping to the porcine, wuzhishan miniature pig, mice, cow and human genomes. our study offers a framework of dynamic gene expression profiling during morphogenesis of additional molars in miniature pigs and provides the molecular bases for understanding mechanisms controlling the initiation cascade of additional molars.

RESULTS
developmental patterns of additional molars
our previous study showed that mandibular additional molar morphogenesis in miniature pigs initiates from the distal extension of the primary dental lamina developing posterior to the third deciduous molar , which differed from replacement teeth derived from secondary dental lamina  <cit> . we further identified an interesting sequential initiation pattern of additional molars in the mandible ramus related to spatiotemporal morphogenesis, where m <dig> initiated from the posterior-free end of the dental lamina over the m <dig> at e <dig> when the m <dig> progressed to the late bell stage. similarly, m <dig> budded off from the posterior-free end of the dental lamina over m <dig>  which reached bell stage at pn <dig> . we observed that the dental lamina maintained integrity without disruption during additional molar morphogenesis, suggesting spatiotemporal control of molar morphogenesis  <cit> . additional molar germs from e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> were chosen, respectively, as three key stages to identify the differentially expressed profiling during morphogenesis of additional molars to determine the spatiotemporal control mechanisms of cascade initiation of these molars. we chose the e <dig> stage corresponding to m <dig> at cap stage without m <dig> initiation and the e <dig> stage targeting m <dig> at bell stage followed by m <dig> initiation. we also chose e <dig> as a reference, when m <dig> progresses to late bell stage but m <dig> changes little. total rna was isolated from additional molar germs at special development stages in the mandible. the transcriptome bioinformatics pipeline using sequencing and microarray revealed the regulatory network of cascade initiation of additional molars in miniature pigs .fig.  <dig> sequential initiation pattern of mandibular additional molar during morphogenesis in the miniature pig. a schematic representation of additional molar germs  in mandible dissected from e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> miniature pig embryos for transcriptome analysis, showing a sequential initiation pattern. b macro view of additional molar germ in miniature pig mandible at the different stages. c serial sagittal histological sections  show the morphogenesis of additional molars at the different stages and additional dental lamina  from the distal extension of the primary dental lamina. adl, additional dental lamina. dm <dig>  the third deciduous molar. m <dig>  the first additional molar. m <dig>  the second additional molar




sequencing and functional annotation of the transcriptome
cdna libraries were obtained from developing additional molar germs at e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> in miniature pigs and normalised to increase sequencing efficiency; a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads with an average length of 100 bp were generated using illumina hiseq  <dig>  about 35 gb of raw data were generated from these libraries .table  <dig> overview of transcriptome sequence assembly




we first used the spliced read aligner tophat  to map all sequencing reads to domestic pig . two rounds of tophat mapping were used to maximize the splice junction information derived from all samples. aligned reads from tophat were assembled into the transcriptome for each sample at e <dig>  e <dig> and  <dig> separately by cufflinks. a total of  <dig>  transcripts were identified and blasted to pig, mice and human genomes, respectively, showing that the transcriptome of the miniature pig had higher identity with human . among these transcripts, a total of  <dig>  were paralogous to pig;  <dig>  were orthologous to the mus musculus gene set ; and  <dig>  were orthologous to human with good similarity. among those blasted transcripts,  <dig> transcripts were shared among pig, mouse and human . when they were blasted to the wuzhishan pig genome  for assessing the completeness of the assembly, the transcripts showed only few unannotated sequences mapped to wzsp . therefore, the sequencing reads were re-mapped onto wzsp for transcript assembly  <cit> . after filtering out low-quality and duplicated reads , the assembled transcripts from e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> were merged into  <dig>  transcripts by running cuffmerge. after the transcripts with fewer than  <dig> exon were filtered, a total of  <dig>  of  <dig>  transcripts were chosen as candidates with a minimum number of  <dig> to a maximum of  <dig> exons  . the assembled transcripts hit  <dig>  of  <dig>  protein-coding genes from the wzsp genome using intersectbed  with 99% overlap .fig.  <dig> overview of transcriptome sequence assembly. a the assembled  <dig>  transcripts by mapping to domestic pig blasted to pig, mice and human, respectively. b venn diagrams show the shared transcripts with orthologous transcripts to human, mus musculus and pig genes. c frequency distribution of the exon number  and trinity transcript length of assembled transcripts mapping to wzsp. x axis represented exon number and y axis represented frequency of the exon number. d the assembled transcripts covered  <dig>  in  <dig>  protein-coding genes identified from the wzsp genome. e the identity of the transcript assembly–based domestic pig  and wzsp  reference genome. f the assembled  <dig>  transcripts were annotated by blasting to wzsp, human, mus musculus and cow




the tophat mapping results indicated that the hits ratio mapping to wzsp was higher than that mapping to domestic pig . through comparison of the transcripts aligned to the assembly of domestic pig  and wzsp  reference genome, only  <dig>  transcripts were found with overlap between them , and only  <dig>  transcripts aligned to the assembly of wzsp  were blasted to the domestic pig genome. a total of  <dig>  of  <dig>  assembled transcripts covered 99% of transcripts of wzsp, and the remaining  <dig>  of  <dig>  transcripts without annotation in wzsp were novel . the transcripts from the assembly-based wzsp genome were chosen for subsequent analysis.table  <dig> the hit ratio of mapping to domestic pig and wuzhishan pig 




the protein-coding or long non-coding transcript prediction with cnci  <cit>  suggested that  <dig>  of  <dig>  transcripts were likely to be protein-coding sequences  and  <dig>  to be long non–protein-coding transcripts. in addition to these  <dig>  transcripts annotated by wzsp, the remaining  <dig>  novel transcripts were blasted respectively to homo sapiens in refseq , bos taurus in  and mus musculus in refseq  for annotation using a homology-based method. orthologue identification indicated that  <dig> coding transcripts and  <dig> non-coding transcripts matched to human mrna with best hits,  <dig> coding transcripts and  <dig> non-coding transcripts matched to cow due to the incomplete cow database, and  <dig> coding transcripts and  <dig> non-coding transcripts matched to mice. after filtering out redundancies and repeats, these new annotations of  <dig>  transcripts were updated. a total of  <dig>  transcripts with functional annotation involved in additional molar germ development were eventually obtained, of which  <dig> were novel transcripts without annotation in the miniature pig .

gene expression quantification from sequencing data was performed using cufflinks with the normalized number of fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads. correlations of mean expression values among groups were calculated. microarray analysis of additional molar germs from e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> was also performed with porcine genome arrays .

our results suggested that the high-quality assembly for miniature pig used in this study had high sequence similarity with wzsp, which offered more information for understanding the spatiotemporal expression profiling of genes during odontogenesis and morphogenesis of additional molars. these assembled high-quality transcripts were employed for subsequent analysis.

differentially expressed genes
after calculation and statistical analysis of the gene expression levels from the rna-seq data using cufflinks, the differentially expressed genes with significance among three stages were screened by cuffdiff  . the differentially expressed genes filtered from microarray among the three different stages were filtered using rvm f-test with multiclassdif  after digital processing of the array data . in total,  <dig> differentially expressed genes from microarray and the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes covering three stages were chosen for pathway and go analysis . most of the qpcr results were consistent with the expression profiles observed using microarrays or transcriptome sequencing .

in the present study,  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes filtered from microarray during three developmental stages were identified by rvm f-test with multiclassdif for go and pathways analysis . furthermore,  <dig> significant go categories from  <dig> differential expression genes were enriched . the top  <dig> go categories were gene expression, mrna metabolic process, translational termination, rna metabolic process, srp-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, cellular protein metabolic process, rna splicing, mrna processing, translation, and small molecule metabolic process. some go categories, such as odontogenesis, odontogenesis of dentine-containing teeth, wnt receptor signalling pathway, negative regulation of epithelial cell proliferation, epithelial cell differentiation and smad protein signal transduction, were predicted to participate in odontogenesis of additional molars and dental lamina determinants according to current knowledge and data from mammalian analyses  .

genes with significant differential expression at three stages were investigated. the differentially expressed genes between e <dig> and e <dig> were identified from microarray  or from sequencing . the differentially expressed genes between e <dig> and e <dig> were identified from microarray  or from sequencing  . venn diagram analysis for differential expression genes during additional molar morphogenesis showed that more changes in gene expression occurred at e <dig> versus e <dig>  and relatively fewer changes between e <dig> and e <dig> . the differential gene expression patterns were consistent with the fact that m <dig> underwent dramatic morphological changes from cap to bell stage followed by initiation of m <dig> and that m <dig> morphogenesis changed little at e <dig>  without evidence of morphological changes in m <dig> fig.  <dig> analysis of differentially expressed genes. a the comparison of up-regulated and down-regulated genes from sequencing and microarray analysis during additional molar morphogenesis showing that up-regulated genes  are predominant at e <dig> versus e <dig>  while down-regulated genes  are dominant at e <dig> versus e <dig>  b venn diagram analysis for differential expression genes from sequencing and microarray during additional molar morphogenesis showing more changes in gene expression at e <dig> versus e <dig> and relatively fewer changes between e <dig> and e <dig>  c pathway enrichment from microarray and sequencing between two stages showing that the wnt, tgf-β and mapk pathways may be involved in cascade initiation of additional molars




these results suggested that some differentially expressed genes between e <dig> and e <dig> were involved in cascade initiation of m <dig> morphogenesis. the results also showed that up-regulated genes dominated m <dig> morphogenesis and m <dig> initiation. a similar pattern was obtained from microarray.

odontogenesis is regulated by epithelial–mesenchymal interactions mediated by conserved signalling pathways including shh, wnt, fgf, tgf-β and bmp  <cit> . to identify the pathways during cascade initiation of additional molars from e <dig> to e <dig>  the differentially expressed genes analysed from rna-seq and microarrays between any two given stages were further screened, as follows. we first identified  <dig> significant pathways from microarrays using pathway analysis according to kegg, biocarta and reatome  for differentially expressed genes. the wnt, tgf-β and mapk pathways were enriched, which provided additional insights into early additional molar development in miniature pigs . our results suggested that additional molar morphogenesis is also closely related to these pathways. moreover, we compared the differential pathways between e <dig> vs e <dig> and e <dig> vs e <dig>  and pathway analysis from rna-seq indicated that the wnt and tgf-β pathways were down-regulated from e <dig> to e <dig> and then up-regulated from e <dig> to e <dig> , implying that additional molar morphogenesis is mediated by fine-tuning of both pathways. the genes involved in these pathways were enriched, showing dynamic changes, and were clustered for further analysis .fig.  <dig> tuning regulation of wnt, tgf-β, hedgehog and mapk pathways during additional molar morphogenesis from e <dig> to e <dig>  a down-regulated wnt, tgf-β and mapk pathways from e <dig> to e <dig>  and up-regulated wnt, tgf-β and hedgehog  pathways from e <dig> to e <dig>  b heatmap showing the dynamics of differential genes participating in the tgf-β, wnt, shh and mapk pathways. the results are based on sequences




identification of signalling pathways during cascade initiation of additional molars
because little is known about patterning of permanent molars in diphyodont mammals, we focused on potential pathways involved in the cascade initiation for patterning of additional molars. we first selected six tendencies of gene expression from the microarray with significance from the pool of  <dig> potential tendencies using stc  to identify which expression profiling from the differentially expressed genes was predominant during cascade initiation and morphogenesis of additional molars. the significant tendencies of gene expression can be grouped into three categories: profile  <dig>  with constantly increased expression ; profile  <dig>  with first increased then unaltered expression ; profile  <dig> , which was just opposite of profile 3; profiles  <dig>  and  <dig> , with constantly decreased expression; and profile  <dig> , characterized by first increased then slightly decreased expression. we then performed further pathway analysis on the most statistically significant profiles,  <dig> and  <dig> according to stc-go analysis, suggesting that tgf-β pathway was involved in dental lamina fate . profile  <dig>  with a significant tendency to constantly increasing gene expression, was closely correlated with m <dig> odontogenesis by stc-go analysis. the included genes were involved in cell adhesion, odontogenesis, odontogenesis of dentine-containing teeth, establishment or maintenance of cell polarity, tgf-β signalling pathway, cellular component movement, epithelial cell morphogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, regulation of epithelial cell migration, negative regulation of bmp signalling pathways, and organ morphogenesis . to further define the pathways that play a central role in determining the relationship between pathways during additional molar morphogenesis, we used the differentially expressed genes in significant expression tendencies filtered from stc analysis for path-net analysis to identify significant pathways and their interactions. thirty significant pathways involving the up-regulated and down-regulated differentially expressed genes were enriched . according to target interaction capacity among pathways, some core pathways most likely related to morphogenesis of additional molars were identified, including mapk signalling, wnt signalling, apoptosis, focal adhesion, pathways in cancer, cell cycle, p <dig> signalling and tgf-β signalling. these pathways consisted of  <dig> differentially expressed genes . combined with stc-go analysis and the context of significant morphology changes of m <dig> and m <dig> initiation at e <dig>  three possible pathways were enriched to contribute most likely to morphogenesis of additional molars, consisting of the tgf-β, wnt and hedgehog signalling pathways. after the differentially expressed genes of three pathways between e <dig> and e <dig> were clustered, our results indicated that the hedgehog and tgf-β signalling pathways were upstream of wnt signalling, implying the fine regulation of additional molar morphogenesis .fig.  <dig> significant pathways and clusters involving differential genes from microarray. interactions among the significant pathways of the differentially expressed genes. among  <dig> significant pathways enriched, mapk signalling, wnt signalling, apoptosis, focal adhesion, pathways in cancer, cell cycle, p <dig> signalling, and tgf-β signalling show powerful target interaction capacity. cycle nodes represent pathways, the size of nodes represents the power of the interrelation among the pathways and an arrow between two nodes represents an interaction target between pathways




next, eight expression trends were predicted based on rna-seq  of two profiles  enriched with significance and many genes. after go terms and pathways analysis, we outlined the interaction between enriched genes from significant pathways via gene–gene interaction networks . the tgf-β, wnt and hedgehog signalling pathways were identified by go and pathway analysis as related to both profile  <dig>  and profile  <dig> , which were predicted to be related to molar morphogenesis because their trends matched the stage changes of additional molars. we also outlined the interaction between enriched pathway genes from both profiles  <dig> and  <dig> by gene–gene interaction networks . our results provided a basis for refining candidate genes related to additional molar morphogenesis.fig.  <dig> analysis of gene expression trends from rna-seq. a the top  <dig> go terms, top  <dig> pathways and gene-interaction net analysis from profiles  <dig> and  <dig> show that many genes and pathways are enriched from both profiles. b the top  <dig> go terms, top  <dig> pathways and gene-interaction net analysis from profiles  <dig> and  <dig> suggest that both wnt and tgf-β signalling pathways are involved in both trends




identification of a regulatory network for gene expression during cascade initiation of additional molars
to better understand the protein–protein interaction network, we screened  <dig> genes from microarray by stc as potential targets for morphogenesis of additional molars. we used signal-net and identified  <dig> core regulators  that had a higher degree, indegree and outdegree, indicating that they had additional interactions with other molecules in the signalling networks . we further performed gene co-expression network analysis to identify potential biologically meaningful genes based on a weighted connectivity score and indicators of statistical relevance among the differentially expressed genes  <cit> . thirty-seven predicted genes with a high degree of relevant scores were screened by dynamic-gene-net as candidate targets required for morphogenesis of additional molars, which represented potential biologically relevant genes and could be used for further analysis .fig.  <dig> gene–gene interaction network and dynamic-gene net from microarray. genes from significant profiles were analysed and identified by signal-net construction. a gene–gene interaction network showing  <dig> core regulators with a higher degree, indegree, and outdegree. b dynamic-gene net predicted  <dig> genes with a high degree of relevant scores as candidates for morphogenesis of additional molars . cycle nodes represent genes, the size of nodes represents the power of the interrelation among the genes and edges between two nodes represent interactions between genes. the more edges of a gene, the more genes connecting to it and the more central role it has within the network




gene expression in the shh, wnt and tgf-β pathways during cascade initiation of additional molars
according to the above analysis, we highlighted the role of shh, wnt and tgf-β pathways in additional molar formation. a previous study indicated that bmp <dig> signalling synergizes with msx <dig> to activate mesenchymal odontogenic potential for tooth morphogenesis and sequential tooth formation  <cit> . sox <dig> expression marks epithelial competence to generate teeth and is linked to the serial addition of molars with sox2+ cells of the first molar contributing to the second and third molars in the mouse  <cit> .

to confirm the role of the shh, wnt and tgf-β pathways in additional molar morphogenesis, we performed immunohistochemistry, qpcr and in situ hybridization to investigate the relationship between temporal and spatial expression distribution of some genes from shh, wnt and tgf-β pathways and additional molar morphogenesis . bmp <dig> expression showed temporal and spatial specificity by immunohistochemistry, qpcr and in situ hybridization, and wnt10b showed a similar expression pattern with bmp <dig> . sox <dig> expression in additional dental lamina and osr <dig> expression showed asymmetric distribution in the buccal–lingual direction. co-immunostaining indicated co-expression of gli1/β-catenin or shh/osr <dig> in inner enamel epithelium, outer enamel epithelium and additional dental lamina . tcf <dig>  a downstream effector of the wnt signalling pathway, is expressed in the inner enamel epithelium, outer enamel epithelium and dental papilla at e <dig> and only in dental papilla at e <dig> .fig.  <dig> gene expression in shh, wnt and tgf-β pathways during cascade initiation of additional molars. a immunohistochemistry of the expression of genes related to tgf-β, wnt, shh and mapk pathways. bmp <dig> expression  mainly resides in the inner enamel epithelium and outer enamel epithelium at e50; is located in the inner enamel epithelium, outer enamel epithelium, dental papilla and additional dental lamina at e60; and then is concentrated in the inner enamel epithelium at e <dig>  wnt10b shows a similar expression pattern with bmp <dig> . sox <dig> expression , located in the inner enamel epithelium and outer enamel epithelium at e <dig>  mainly occurs in additional dental lamina at e <dig> and is visible in inner enamel epithelium and additional dental lamina at e <dig>  sox <dig> expression in additional dental lamina shows an asymmetric distribution. positive expression is visualized by dab  and counterstained with haematoxylin . lingual is to the left. scale bars, 200 μm. b rt-qpcr of the expression of bmp <dig> and shh showing dynamic changes consistent with immunohistochemistry results. error bars indicate s.d. three biological replicates. c immunofluorescence shows the relationship among the shh, wnt and tgf-β pathways. immunofluorescence of gli <dig>  and β-catenin  shows their co-expression in inner enamel epithelium, outer enamel epithelium and additional dental lamina ; co-immunostaining of shh  and osr <dig>  in inner enamel epithelium, outer enamel epithelium, dental papilla and additional dental lamina. lingual is to the right. scale bars, 500 μm. d mrna expression of bmp <dig> and an important wnt pathway transcription factor tcf <dig> detected by in situ hybridization at e <dig> and e <dig> of m <dig> . at e <dig>  bmp <dig> is expressed in the inner enamel epithelium especially in the enamel knot and in the mesenchyme cells close to the epithelium. at e <dig>  bmp <dig> is mainly expressed in the inner enamel epithelium, similar to immunofluorescence results. tcf <dig> is expressed in the inner enamel epithelium, outer enamel epithelium and dental papilla at e <dig> and only in dental papilla at e <dig>  black dashed lines mark the boundary of the tooth bud epithelium. scale bars, 100 μm




long intergenic non-coding rna
studies have shown that long non-coding rnas  play important regulatory roles in fundamental biological processes. these rnas in general exhibit more cell type-, tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression profiles than mrnas . the contribution of lncrnas to the additional molar morphogenesis of miniature pigs has not been reported. we obtained  <dig>  candidate long intergenic non-coding rnas . then the lincrnas were mapped to the pig genome to obtain known and novel lincrna transcripts. the candidate lincrnas were further filtered by being blasted to human and mouse to exclude protein-coding genes and remove transcripts that had similarity to known proteins or protein domains. the long non–protein-coding transcripts from e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> were merged using cuffmerge to obtain  <dig> lincrna candidates. previous studies in mammals have shown that lncrnas are shorter, less conserved and expressed at significantly lower levels than protein-coding genes  <cit> . we found that miniature pig lincrnas were about half the length of protein-coding transcripts on average . moreover, lincrnas had fewer exons per transcript  than the average protein-coding gene . these properties are comparable to the estimated transcript length and exon number of human lncrnas   <cit> . the expression level of lincrnas was lower than that of protein-coding genes, consistent with the low expression levels of their mammalian counterparts . we then aligned those lincrnas to mouse, human  and cow  using blastn. orthologue identification indicated that only  <dig> non-coding transcripts matched to human mrna with best hits,  <dig> non-coding transcripts matched to cow and  <dig> non-coding transcripts to mice , suggesting that those lincrnas candidates were shorter, less conserved and expressed at lower levels than protein-coding genes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> overview of lincrnas during additional molar morphogenesis. a transcript length, exon number and expression abundance of lincrnas were less than that of coding rnas. b identified lincrnas showed low conservation when blasted to human, cow and mus musculus. c heatmap of the stage-specific expression of  <dig> putative lincrnas during additional molar morphogenesis. d venn diagrams of the stage-specific expression profiling of  <dig> differentially expressed lincrnas show that  <dig> lincrnas were identified between e <dig> and e <dig> and  <dig> lincrnas between e <dig> and e <dig>  and  <dig> lincrnas overlapped among e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  e heatmap showing a negative correlation between lincrnas and the neighbouring genes of the lincrna locus between e <dig> and e <dig>  f co-expression-net analysis of lincrnas and mrnas. left panel: genes with strong co-expression of lincrnas  and mrnas  from significant pathways of profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  right panel: co-expression of lincrnas and mrnas from significant pathways of profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  pearson coefficient >  <dig> 




after the differentially expressed lincrnas between two stages were further examined, we identified a final set of  <dig> putative lincrnas  and subsequently profiled their expression at three key stages during cascade initiation of additional molars.. the results showed those expressions exhibited temporal and spatial specificity . in total,  <dig> differentially expressed lincrnas were identified between e <dig> and e <dig> ;  <dig> differentially expressed lincrnas were identified between e <dig> and e <dig> , and  <dig> lincrnas overlapped among e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> .

although most lncrnas have not been functionally characterized, previous studies have shown that mammalian lncrnas are preferentially located next to genes with developmental functions in the regulation of gene expression in either cis or trans  <cit> . considering that e <dig> is a key stage for m <dig> initiation, we focused on neighbouring genes of differentially expressed lincrnas between e <dig> and e <dig> and obtained a set of such genes for enrichment of go. this lincrna profile illustrated the intricate relationship between coding mrna and lincrna transcripts in additional molar development.

recent studies have suggested that lncrna expression patterns are often correlated with mrna expression patterns to regulate the expression of neighbouring genes in cis or target distant transcriptional activators or repressors in trans . we found that some lincrnas are negatively correlated with neighbouring genes, implying that those lincrnas may play a cis regulatory role . furthermore, we constructed networks based on trends from rna-seq to identify the index of the co-expression relationship between differentially expressed lincrnas and mrnas, suggesting that certain lincrnas may be co-regulated in expression networks . these data may offer valuable resources for future functional studies of lincrnas related to additional molar development.

discussion
in the present study, we characterized the temporal gene expression profiles of additional molars at early stages in miniature pigs. we identified key pathways participating in additional molar development and uncovered key genes and novel transcripts and lincrnas associated with early odontogenesis and morphogenesis of additional molars. our results showed extensive conserved homology of the transcriptome between the miniature pig and humans. in addition, the transcriptome of additional molars in miniature pigs shared similar required signals for odontogenesis with other mammals, demonstrating that the miniature pig is a much better and more biologically relevant animal model than mice for studying permanent molar development. the profiling of differentiated genes, identified pathways and key genes will further facilitate in-depth surveys of molecular mechanisms of the spatiotemporal cascade initiation of additional molars in a large diphyodont mammal. the identification of new lincrnas will aid in advancing our understanding of their regulatory roles in this cascade initiation.

recent studies from diphyodont mammals including ferret and swine have shown that permanent molars, being different from replacement teeth  initiated from secondary dental lamina, bud off from the posterior-free end of primary dental lamina  <cit> . similar to humans, pig permanent molars that develop behind the deciduous dentition are not replaced, forming sequentially in an anterior-to-posterior direction. we further identified a spatiotemporal pattern of additional molar cascade initiation  <cit> ; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating sequential additional molar formation remain unclear. studies using mouse models showed that removal of the murine m <dig> from the developing m <dig> placode in culture leads to the formation of a fourth molar   <cit> . an inhibitory cascade model thus has been proposed to account for sequential molar initiation in mammals. sequential initiation of molars depends on a balance between inter-molar inhibition and mesenchymal activators. inhibin-βa and bmp <dig> are candidate mesenchymal activators whereas sostdc <dig> is a candidate inter-molar inhibitor  <cit> . the bmp4–msx <dig> positive feedback loop has been identified as playing a critical role in driving sequential tooth formation; the wnt–shh–sostdc <dig> negative feedback loop with a potential mechanism in which wnt signalling induces shh to suppress the wnt/β-catenin pathway was proposed to account for spatial tooth patterning . in the present study, the wnt and tgf-β pathways displayed associations with cascade initiation of molars. further dissection of the functions of both pathways using the miniature pig as a model will provide key insights into the sequential regulation of the initiation of molars.

little is known about why almost all mammals develop three molars and what limits the number of molars in most mammal species. molar agenesis is common in humans, and the third molar is mostly affected , followed by the second molar  and the first molar . mutations in msx <dig>  pax <dig>  pitx <dig> and tfap2b have been detected in patients with molar agenesis. in the mouse, mutations in actriia/b, fgf <dig>  smad <dig>  smo and iκbα also present a molar-agenesis phenotype  <cit> . most of these genes were identified in our study, which showed a temporal differential expression pattern during additional molar morphogenesis. our results provide gene expression profiling that can aid in understanding molar agenesis. moreover, the miniature pigs are convenient for performing a comparison of differentially expressed gene dynamics during replacement and additional tooth morphogenesis, which could contribute to understanding the underlying mechanism regulating permanent teeth development.

the analysis of epithelial determination implies that the dental lamina plays a key role in spatiotemporal initiation of additional molars. the stage-specific gene expression patterns suggest that up-regulated genes are predominant in e <dig> versus e <dig> while down-regulated genes dominate the morphogenesis in e <dig> versus e <dig> during early additional molar development. the combination pathway-net and signal-net results suggest that sequential formation of additional molars is linked by common pathways that likely control the balance among growth, proliferation and differentiation as new dental organs initiate development. specifically, spatiotemporal patterns of additional molars are controlled by fine-tuning the signals mediating morphogenesis and odontogenesis. moreover, our results also imply that the wnt and tgf-β pathways strongly correlate with cascade initiation of additional molars.

a systematic analysis of lincrnas expressed during additional molar morphogenesis has been elusive. several studies have indicated that some lncrnas play important roles in fundamental biological processes by a range of mechanisms, such as interacting with and modulating the activity of chromatin modification; acting as decoys in the sequestration of mirnas, transcription factors and proteins; or serving as precursors for the generation of sirnas . here we provided the first systematic identification of lincrnas during additional molar morphogenesis in miniature pigs and  <dig> differentiated lincrnas. many lincrnas negatively correlated with genes near lincrnas, implying that lincrnas may play a role in regulating the silencing of neighbouring genes. additional studies will result in a better understanding of the function and transcriptional regulation mechanism of lincrnas during additional molar morphogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results will not only contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of additional molar developmental regulation but also provide the foundation for further exploring the regulation mechanisms of spatiotemporal variation of human permanent molars in number, size, location and eruption. the dynamic expression profiling of the identified lincrnas will also yield novel insights into the cascade initiation of additional molars and pave the way for further explorations of the functional roles of lincrna during porcine additional molar development.
