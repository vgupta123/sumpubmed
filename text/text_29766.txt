BACKGROUND
most bacteria have a regulatory system, known as quorum sensing , to modulate gene expression as a function of their cell density . it usually works via the production of a signaling molecule that reaches a threshold concentration at high cell density allowing its detection by the bacterial population and resulting in the modulation of target gene expression. in gram negative, n-acyl homoserine lactone signaling molecules  are thus far the most common signal molecules produced. a typical ahl qs system involves two major components: an ahl synthase gene  and a modular transcriptional response-regulator  which detects and responds to the ahl concentration  <cit> .

ahl qs thus far is exclusively found in proteobacteria;  <dig> of  <dig> sequenced proteobacterial genomes possess at least one luxi/r family pair  <cit> . interestingly,  <dig> genomes contained at least one luxr gene having the modular characteristics of the qs-family of regulators; however it was not associated with a cognate luxi-family gene. of these,  <dig> genomes harbor at least one complete ahl qs system in addition to one or more luxr gene/s. these unpaired luxr family proteins were firstly designated orphans  <cit>  and recently they have been proposed to be renamed as luxr 'solos'  <cit> ; a few of these luxr solos are beginning to be studied. expr of sinorhizobium meliloti, bisr of rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae and qscr of pseudomonas aeruginosa, are luxr solo proteins in ahl producing bacteria which have been well characterized and shown to be integrated with the resident complete ahl qs regulatory networks  <cit> . only two solo luxr homologs in non-ahl producing bacteria have thus far been investigated in some detail. one is called sdia which is present in the salmonella enterica and escherichia coli and shown to be able to bind and detect ahls produced by other bacteria. the other one is from plant pathogenic xanthomonas spp. and in two xanthomonas species it is involved in regulating virulence factors upon binding an unknown plant produced low molecular weight compound which is not an ahl  <cit> . this indicates that certain quorum sensing related luxr family proteins are able to be involved in inter-kingdom signaling by detecting non-ahl compounds produced by eukaryotes.

pseudomonas putida strains are mainly studied either for their ability to establish beneficial association with plants or due to their versatile catabolic potential. previous studies have indicated that the majority of soil-borne or plant-associated p. putida strains do not produce ahls; apparently only about one third of strains belonging to these species have a complete ahl qs system  <cit> . furthermore, the type and role played by these ahl qs systems varies and is highly unpredictable  <cit> . p. putida strains appear to be rather unique in displaying such variation and lack of conservation in their ahl qs systems. in this study we report however that a luxr solo is very well conserved in all p. putida strains we tested. this protein, which we designated ppor, was shown to be able bind to ahls, was not involved in rhizosphere colonization and was shown to be involved in the regulation of several loci. in addition its gene is stringently growth-phase regulated. the presence and sequence similarity of ppor and its orthologs in all p. putida strains indicates that this protein might play a conserved role associated with the detection and response to bacterial endogenous and/or exogenous signaling compounds.

RESULTS
ppor, an unpaired luxr homolog protein is highly conserved in pseudomonas putida
the model p. putida kt <dig> has not been reported to possess an ahl qs system and its genome sequence does not encode for a luxi homolog. as we were interested in studying solo qs luxr homolog proteins in p. putida, the genome sequence of p. putida kt <dig>  was examined for the presence of such proteins that typically contain an n-terminal ahl binding domain  and a c-terminal helix-turn-helix dna binding domain . a single orf, pp_ <dig> of  <dig> bp was identified encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids and named as ppor . a blast search revealed high similarity to several other p. putida strains whose genome sequences, either complete or partial are available in the ncbi database. ppor exhibits similarity to orthologs from p. putida f <dig> , p. putida gb- <dig> , p. putida w <dig>  as well as to its homolog from p. entomophila l <dig> . we were also interested to know if ppor is present in two other p. putida strains; namely p. putida wcs <dig> and p. putida rd8mr3; these two p. putida strains also possess a complete ahl qs system, hence they are able to produce and respond to ahls  <cit> . it was established that they possess a ppor ortholog as we have cloned and sequenced ppor from both strains . importantly, all these orthologs along with ppor of p. putida kt <dig> retain those five amino acids in their ahl-binding domain that are invariant in this family of proteins . these observations indicate that ppor is highly conserved as it is present in all p. putida strains that we examined, suggesting that it might be part of the core genome of p. putida. on the other hand, approximately only one-third of p. putida strains possess a complete ahl qs; in addition, the type and role of these systems is not conserved  <cit> . homologs of ppor are also present in several groups of other bacteria which belong to γ-proteobacteria, β-proteobacteria as well as enterobacteria, all of which show a high similarity of around 50% at amino acid level, indicating conservation across species .

ppor binds to ahl molecules
the presence of conserved amino acids in the ahl binding domain of ppor of p. putida kt <dig> indicated a possible binding to one or more ahls. in order to identify if and which ahls may bind ppor, an ahl-binding assay was performed. e. coli strains that expressed ppor protein or contained vector alone were grown in the presence of a set of externally supplemented ahls  and any ahl that may bind to ppor was visualized after purification via organic extraction, tlc and overlay with an ahl biosensor/indicator strain . purification of ahls from e. coli over-expressing ppor resulted in detection of 3-oxo-c6-hsl while e. coli cells which contained only the vector control, did not show any ahl . these results strongly indicate that ppor most probably binds to 3-oxo-c6-hsl. additionally, ppor also exhibited probable binding to 3-oxo-c8-hsl and 3-oxo-c10-hsl, but to a lower extent at the concentrations of ahls used in our experiment . all the other ahls tested in our assay could not be detected by tlc meaning over-expression of ppor did not result in their purification. this could mean that they most probably do not bind to these ahls or the binding is much lower than the sensitivity of this assay. it was concluded that ppor of p. putida kt <dig> and most probably other p. putida strains lacking a complete ahl qs system could be sensing and responding to ahl signals produced by neighboring bacteria. ppor may also recognize endogenous ahl signals if the p. putida strain is able to produce ahls. interestingly, the few p. putida strains reported to possess a complete ahl qs system produce 3-oxo-c6-hsl  <cit> , which as shown in this study could bind ppor. in order to verify that p. putida wcs <dig> produced biologically active concentrations of 3-oxo-c6-hsl, we quantified these ahl levels in the wild type and in the ppor mutant strains. as can be seen from figure  <dig>  strain wcs <dig> produced biologically active concentrations of ahls and interestingly the ppor mutant produced higher quantities. the reason for this is currently unknown, it cannot be excluded that lack of ppor in the cells could result in higher quantities of free ahls since as shown above, ppor can bind and titrate away 3-oxo-c6-hsl.

ppor interacts with the endogenous ahl qs system of p. putida wcs358
to study the role of ppor in p. putida wcs <dig> and p. putida rd8mr <dig> which also have a resident ahl qs system, knock-out mutants in ppor were generated in both these strains . the ahl production profile of the ppor mutant was similar to the one of the wt with only a reproducible slight increase in the intensity of the signal for wcs358ppor and lower intensity than wild type for rd8mr3ppor . quantification of the amount of signal produced by the ppor mutant , showed a similar trend of the ppor mutants producing slightly more ahls for wcs <dig> and slightly less ahls for rd8mr <dig> .

we also determined if ppor was involved in transcriptional regulation of the qs systems ppui/r of p. putida wcs <dig> and ppri/r of p. putida rd8mr <dig>  to perform this experiment, lacz-transcriptional promoter probe fusions of ppui, ppur and rsal for p. putida wcs <dig> and ppri for p. putida rd8mr <dig> were monitored for expression throughout the growth phase in their respective wild type and ppor mutant strains. for p. putida wcs <dig> qs-related gene promoters, it was observed that ppur and rsal promoters showed comparable expression levels in both wild type and ppor mutant strains at different growth phases . on the other hand the ppui promoter of p. putida wcs <dig> controlling the ahl synthase exhibited consistently higher expression levels in wcs358ppor especially in the logarithmic growth phase which was statistically significant . the ppri transcription levels in p. putida rd8mr <dig> were not significantly different from the wild type 

in order to understand whether ppor expression is under the control of the qs systems of p. putida wcs <dig> and rd8mr <dig>  ppor promoter-lacz reporter fusions of both strains were assayed in their respective qs system mutants and compared with wild type strains at different growth phases. interestingly, in p. putida wcs <dig>  ppor expression shows substantial increase in the ibe <dig> ppui ahl synthase mutant, indicating a qs system mediated repression of ppor expression . the ppor promoter levels in this genetic background were not restored to wcs <dig> wild-type levels by adding exogenously the four ahls  produced by wcs <dig> . the reason for this is not known and we cannot exclude that qs is particularly sensitive to growth phase and ahl concentration, thus exogenous addition of ahls might not necessarily re-establish the conditions present in the wild-type strain.

the expression levels of ppor in p. putida wcs <dig> ibe <dig> & ibe <dig> , and p. putida rd8mr3ppri and rd8mr3pprr although higher were not statistically significant . these results suggest that ppor interaction with the endogenous qs systems in these two p. putida strains may not be similar; in strain wcs <dig> negative regulation  of ppor gene expression occurred in response to ahls via a mechanism which could be independent of the cognate ppur ahl sensor/regulator.

ppor expression is growth phase regulated
in order to understand if ppor expression patterns showed any correlation to its role in interacting with the endogenous qs system, ppor expression levels were measured as β-galactosidase activities at different growth phases. importantly, it was observed for both p. putida wcs <dig> and rd8mr <dig> that at low cell densities ppor transcription showed minimal expression but was found to increase sharply when the culture enters the logarithmic phase of growth . this pattern of expression level was maintained even in wcs358ppor and rd8mr3ppor indicating a lack of regulation by ppor of its own expression. to find out if ppor expression is under the control of well known growth phase dependent global regulators, its expression level was monitored in p. putida wcs <dig> mko <dig> , m <dig>  and ibe <dig> . there was no significant difference in the expression pattern levels of ppor promoter in the three mutants when compared to wild type suggesting that these three global growth-phase regulators were not involved in modulating ppor expression levels . it was therefore concluded that ppor gene expression is stringently growth phase regulated via a yet unidentified regulator.

rhizosphere colonization ability of p. putida wcs358ppor & rd8mr3ppor are not affected
traits involved in surface associated growth of p. putida may be regulated by their qs system and possibly also determine their fitness in the rhizosphere  <cit> . rice root colonization was carried out following the protocol as previously reported  <cit>  with p. putida wcs <dig> wild type, wcs358ppor and wcs <dig> qs mutants. our results revealed that wild type, ibe <dig> & ibe <dig> exhibited similar degree of colonization whereas ibe <dig> & wcs358ppor were slightly better in colonization of rice roots . one way anova analysis in conjunction with dunnett's test  was carried out to confirm that the means of the cell number were significantly different when compared to the wild type strain. similar experiment with rd8mr <dig> wild type and rd8mr3ppor showed that they colonized rice roots to the same extent .

identification of putative target genes of ppor by microarrayanalysis
in order to identify target genes directly or indirectly regulated by ppor, global gene expression comparison was performed of p. putida wcs <dig> wild type with a strain over expressing ppor . microarray analysis was performed with a single biological sample for each strain with four technical replicates . our results revealed that a total of  <dig> genes show differential expression of more than two fold  in cultures that were grown in minimal medium . majority of genes that showed a down regulation of gene expression in the ppor++ strain were those involved in amino acid catabolism. genes that showed up regulation of expression in the ppor++ were those that take part in protein synthesis and sulfur metabolism.

in order to validate the differential expression of genes observed in the microarray experiment, semi quantitative rt pcr analysis of three genes pp_ <dig>  pp_ <dig> and pp_ <dig>  was performed as they were among genes that showed maximum up-regulation in ppor++ strains when compared to wild type. briefly, pp_ <dig> codes for a putative abc transporter periplasmic binding protein , pp_ <dig>  designated as taua, encodes a putative taurine abc transporter periplasmic binding protein  and pp_ <dig>  named lsfa, codes for a putative peroxidase . rt pcr analysis with two independent rna isolations shows more than two fold increases in expression of these genes in ppor++ strain when compared to wild type and is in agreement with the results obtained in microarray . as these genes take part in inorganic ion utilization and oxidative stress, it is possible that ppor might play a functional role in these processes.

CONCLUSIONS
the roles of solo qs luxr proteins in inter-species as well inter-kingdom signaling are just beginning to be understood with a few recent studies on these proteins in non-ahl producing bacteria. the extent of the functional participation/interaction of these proteins in qs in ahl producing bacteria also differs depending on the strain. we have characterized ppor, a solo luxr homolog present in both ahl and non-ahl producing bacteria; its conservation indicates a significant role for this protein of p. putida. in fact most strains of p. putida do not harbor an ahl quorum sensing system, however they possess ppor indicating that it is likely to be part of the core genome of this species. we have shown that ppor binds ahls and that it is highly conserved in p. putida; and this in our view represents the important novel finding of our study., in addition we believe that we are in a position to conclude that the results obtained using our strain represent what occurs in p. putida strains . future studies will be directed towards understanding the regulation of target genes in response to exogenous ahls in certain p. putida strains and also possibly endogenous ahls in strains which harbor an ahl qs system.
