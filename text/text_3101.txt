BACKGROUND
cells have evolved surveillance mechanisms to ensure the fidelity of gene expression. one such mechanism, nonsense-mediated mrna decay , was discovered about twenty years ago in yeast  <cit>  and then described in human inherited diseases caused by nonsense or frameshift mutations  <cit> , which introduce premature termination codons . contrary to what would be predicted based on the nature of the mutation , the resulting nonsense mrnas rarely code for truncated protein products and are rather rapidly degraded  <cit> . hence, nmd was first envisaged as a mean to protect cells against the effects of deleterious truncated proteins, with potential dominant-negative effects or a gain of function. moreover, it seems that nmd has not solely evolved under the pressure of nonsense mrnas originating from mutations but it also monitors ptc-containing transcripts arising from abnormalities in gene expression  <cit> . nmd plays a role in normal cellular development as examplified by the production of functional tcr and ig genes. during lymphocyte maturation, these genes are subjected to extensive rearrangements and somatic mutation events. approximately two-thirds of the rearranged genes are not in the proper translational reading frame and the resulting transcripts are down-regulated by nmd, ensuring that only functional tcr and ig genes are expressed  <cit> . more recently, it was suggested that nmd could play a role in the regulation of gene expression. this was first suspected following the identification of unproductive splicing products of the srp <dig> and srp30b proteins or the ribosomal proteins l <dig>  l7a, l10a and l <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . the coupling of alternative splicing, which generates transcripts containing ptcs and nmd, which degrades these transcripts, enables the negative regulation of gene expression  <cit> . this system, termed rust  is also used in humans  <cit> . it was suggested that alternative splicing leading to nmd might prove to be a common mechanism of autoregulation of many splicing factors  <cit> . for example, the polypyrimidine tract binding protein , which generally acts as a splicing repressor, downregulates its own expression by repressing exon  <dig> inclusion in the mature mrna  <cit> . the resulting alternative ptb mrna lacking exon  <dig> contains a ptc and is subjected to nmd  <cit> . this negative autoregulation prevents the accumulation of ptb, and therefore the inappropriate processing of its targets  <cit> . this coupling of alternative splicing and nmd seems to be a rather common mechanism, as in silico analyses show that 35% of est-suggested alternative transcripts contain ptcs  <cit> . alternative splicing is thought to occur in 30â€“60% of human genes  <cit> , and in addition to expanding proteome diversity, it may play a role in gene expression regulation by generating ptc-containing alternative isoforms. interestingly,  <dig> to 30% of nonsense transcripts can escape nmd and are further immune to degradation  <cit> . whether such transcripts code for proteins with a physiological function is unknown.

fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase  is the last enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway. a deficiency in fah causes hereditary tyrosinemia type i , the most severe disease of the pathway  <cit> . this inherited metabolic disorder is characterized by severe hepatic and renal dysfunctions often resulting in death in the first years of life if untreated. hti displays phenotypic heterogeneity with both chronic and acute forms  <cit> . the fah coding gene located on chromosome  <dig> in the q23-q <dig> region  <cit>  spans over  <dig> kb and contains  <dig> exons  <cit> . forty-seven mutations have been identified so far in the fah gene, including  <dig> nonsense mutations  <cit> . while characterizing the effects of the w262x nonsense mutation on fah mrna metabolism, we identified two alternative transcripts, del <dig> and del <dig> in a hti patient homozygous for w262x. these transcripts are found in normal cells and thus are not due to the nonsense mutation per se. interestingly, del <dig> has skipped exon  <dig> and as a consequence, the reading frame is shifted, with the appearance of several new ptcs. this transcript is therefore likely subjected to nmd, as suggested by a block of translation by cycloheximide. however, the amount of nonsense transcript which escapes nmd seems to be sufficient to produce a protein of 31-kda, detected in several human tissues. this report suggests that nmd may allow for the production of low amounts of protein.

RESULTS
identification of two alternative transcripts of the fah gene
the w262x mutation is a g->a transversion located in exon  <dig> of the fah gene at nucleotide position  <dig> and is frequent in the finnish population  <cit> . no protein was detected in the liver or the fibroblasts of homozygous patients  <cit> . consistent with this type of mutation, we demonstrated that w262x mrnas are degraded by nmd in the cytoplasm  <cit> . while studying the decay of w262x nonsense fah transcripts in lymphoblastoid cell lines, we repeatedly observed two additional rt-pcr products in homozygous w262x/w262x cells . purification and sequence analysis of these two products revealed that they were alternative transcripts of the fah gene. the first one, del <dig>  lacks exon  <dig>  and the second one, del <dig>  which is less abundant, lacks both exons  <dig> and  <dig> . in del <dig>  the skipping of exon  <dig> from the mature transcript causes a shift in the reading frame and as a consequence, several new ptcs appear, the first one being located at the 3' end of exon  <dig>  at the new amino acid position  <dig> . the g786a mutation does not code for a stop codon in del <dig> but causes the replacement of a glycine by a glutamate residue . del <dig> does not show further disruption of the open reading frame downstream of the deletion and is predicted to code for a shorter fah-like protein  missing the region encoded by exons  <dig> and  <dig> .

del <dig> and del <dig> were first identified in the liver of a patient harboring another mutation , which weakens the donor splice site of exon  <dig>  <cit> . because the w262x mutation is located in the same exon and that in some cases a nonsense codon can affect splicing  <cit> , we wondered whether these two transcripts were due to an effect of the w262x mutation on a cis-acting splicing element in exon  <dig>  to test this hypothesis, rt-pcrs were performed using primers spanning the exon7-exon <dig> junction or the exon7-exon <dig> junction to specifically amplify del <dig> and del <dig> respectively. as shown in figure 1b, both del <dig> and del <dig> transcripts were detected by this method, in homozygous mutant cells , as well as in normal cells . the identity of these amplification products was verified by sequencing . a similar result was found in various human cell lines . indeed, del <dig> and del <dig> were amplified in fibroblasts, hela cells  and in human liver , the tissue where fah is the most expressed  <cit> . moreover, del <dig> was amplified in two hti cell lines , which harbor either a splice mutation in intron  <dig>  or two nonsense mutations in exon  <dig> . del <dig> was not detected in these two cell lines as expected, since these mutations introduce ptcs either following exon  <dig> skipping  or due to the two nonsense mutations themselves , that likely target the nonsense transcripts to the nmd pathway.

altogether, these data strongly argue in favor of del <dig> and del <dig> being minor alternative transcripts of the fah gene, rather than resulting from the presence of the w262x mutation.

the del <dig> transcript is translated into a protein
the identification of two minor alternative transcripts of the fah gene raised the question whether they resulted from errors of the splicing apparatus and were unproductive alternative transcripts or whether they could produce protein products with potential physiological roles. there is presently no reported indication for the existence of additional fah isoforms. the del <dig> open reading frame is identical to fah, except for the missing region encoded by the skipped exons  <dig> and  <dig> and corresponding to amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> . the open reading frame of the del <dig> transcript is identical to fah and del <dig> from the atg start codon to amino acid  <dig>  however, the last  <dig> amino acids of the putative del <dig> protein encoded by exons  <dig> and  <dig> are completely different, due to the shift in the reading frame following exon  <dig> skipping . to find out if del <dig> was translated into a protein, we raised an antiserum against the last  <dig> amino acids of the putative del <dig> protein and used it to search for the presence of this protein in different adult human tissues. these tissues were obtained after an autopsy and only one sample per tissue was tested, due to the difficulty to obtain them. as shown in figure 2b , a cross-reacting band was present in heart, liver, kidney, spleen, suprarenals and bladder. the del <dig> protein has an apparent molecular weight of 31-kda, consistent with the value of  <dig> -kda calculated from its sequence. interestingly, the expression level of the del <dig> protein varied between the different tissues and it differed from that of fah . for example, fah was barely detected in the spleen, whereas the expression level of the del <dig> protein was the highest in this tissue . a monoclonal antibody directed against the n-terminal part of the fah protein was used to detect both fah and del <dig> in the tissues where fah is the less expressed . del <dig> was barely detected in the spleen, suggesting that the protein is synthezised in very low amounts.

the specificity of the signal was verified by adsorbing the antiserum on the purified c-terminus of del <dig>  used for the mouse immunization. as shown in figure 3a , the affinity-purified antiserum still recognized the 31-kda protein, whereas the non-adsorbed fraction did not show any cross-reactivity . the protein of low molecular weight, which is recognized by the non-adsorbed antiserum in the spleen, is unspecific background . a del <dig> protein with the myc tag was synthesized in an in vitro transcription-translation assay and immunoprecipitated using an anti-myc antibody. the anti-del <dig> antiserum recognizes the immunoprecipitated del100-myc protein, further demonstrating its specificity . altogether these results suggest that the del <dig> alternative transcript is translated into a protein of 31-kda whose expression in different tissues differs from that of fah.

the del <dig> transcript seems to be subjected to nmd
the skipping of exon  <dig> in del <dig> causes a change in the reading frame and as a consequence, several new stop codons appear . to verify if the nonsense del <dig> transcript was subjected to nmd, lymphoblastoid cells were treated with cycloheximide  an inhibitor of translation. stabilization of nonsense transcripts following such a treatment suggests that they are degraded through the nmd pathway  <cit> . the effectiveness of the treatment was previously verified on the full-length w262x containing transcript  <cit>  and an example is given in figure 4a . the full-length transcript was up-regulated in the homozygous cell line  but remains unaffected in wild-type cells . the same treatment was used to determine the fate of the del <dig> transcript . a stabilization of this alternative transcript was observed when the fah transcripts were amplified from exons  <dig> to  <dig> in wild-type and homozygous cells . the same result was obtained using a specific amplification of the del <dig> transcript . the amount of del <dig> following cycloheximide treatment increased about 5-fold the level observed in untreated cells . these results suggested that del <dig> is indeed subjected to nmd in homozygous cells and in normal cells as well. in contrast del <dig>  which does not contain any ptc as a result of the skipping of both exons  <dig> and  <dig>  seemed relatively unaffected by the cycloheximide treatment as expected  and does not seem to be subjected to nmd. this result confirmed those obtained in e357x/e364x or ivs12/ivs <dig> hti fibroblasts , where del <dig> was undetectable probably because of the introduction of ptcs in these transcripts and their targeting to the nmd pathway.

discussion
del <dig> and del <dig> were originally identified while studying the impact of nmd on hereditary tyrosinemia type i. during the characterization of the effects of the w262x mutation on fah mrna metabolism  <cit> , we detected two minor alternative transcripts. if due to the w262x mutation, they should only be produced when the nonsense mutation is present, i.e. in heterozygous  and homozygous  cell lines. however, by using specific primers for each transcript, we found that both del <dig> and del <dig> are produced in normal lymphoblastoid cells  and in normal human liver. del <dig> was also present in two different hti cell lines harboring different nonsense mutations  or a splice mutation  in exon  <dig> or intron  <dig> respectively. these data argue in favor of del <dig> and del <dig> resulting from alternative splicing pathways rather than from a w262x-associated altered splicing mechanism. we suggest that both transcripts result from a weak definition of exon  <dig> . indeed, exon  <dig> is subjected to many alterations as a result of splice mutations in the region encompassing exons  <dig> to  <dig>  for example, due to a splice mutation in intron  <dig> , a cryptic acceptor site in exon  <dig> is activated or exon  <dig> is skipped  <cit> . del <dig> and del <dig> were also identified in the case of the q279r mutation, a splicing mutation that weakens the donor splice site of exon  <dig>  <cit> . figure  <dig> presents with a model that could explain these observations: we suggest that in the major splicing pathway, intron  <dig> is removed before introns  <dig> and  <dig>  leading to a splice intermediate that contains the merged exons  <dig> and  <dig>  both exons are subsequently defined as a single exon. the order of intron removal is an important determinant of the outcome of splice-site mutations and could explain some unusual alterations, like the skipping of contiguous exons, as strongly suggested by studies of the col1a <dig> and col5a <dig> splice mutations  <cit> . altogether, these data suggest that at least del <dig> may arise through a minor splicing pathway due to an error-prone splicing apparatus because of the weak definition of exon  <dig> and the order of intron removal. del <dig> could originate from a second minor splicing pathway, in which exon  <dig> is skipped alone because of its weak definition .

del <dig> and del <dig> are thus the first cases of alternative splicing for the fah gene. however, it remained to see whether they were unproductive splice isoforms or whether they could code for protein isoforms. the del <dig> transcript retains an unchanged open reading frame when compared to fah. the putative del <dig> protein would be similar to fah except for the lower molecular weight , due to the missing region encoded by exons  <dig> and  <dig>  we have been unable to detect a protein species of the size that could correspond to del <dig> using an antibody against full-length fah. whether this reflects the absence of such a protein or its presence in a very low amount undetectable with the presently available antibodies remains unknown. the latter explanation seems plausible since the del <dig> transcript, although not subjected to nmd, is much less abundant that the full-length fah transcript or del <dig>  as it is barely detected in w262x cells with the rt <dig> and rt <dig> primers  and the number of pcr cycles needed for its visualization is higher than for del <dig> when using the specific primers.

the structure of the putative del <dig> protein in the n-terminal part is identical to that of fah. but due to exon  <dig> skipping, the reading frame is very different in the last  <dig> amino acids. del <dig>  a 31-kda protein, was detected in different human tissues using an antiserum raised against the specific c-terminal part of the putative protein. the antiserum is specific for the del <dig> protein and does not cross-react with fah. in addition, the cross-reacting 31-kda band was lost after adsorbing the antiserum against the purified peptide used for the immunization and the antiserum recognizes an in vitro translated del100-myc protein, demonstrating its specificity. thus the del <dig> transcript seems to direct the synthesis of a protein. this result is surprising because this transcript contains ptcs and seems to be subjected to nmd, as shown by a block of translation following a cycloheximide treatment. interestingly, fah and del <dig> have converse expression patterns in the human tissues examined. this suggests a post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of the two proteins, since the two transcripts originate from the same pre-mrna. alternative splicing, a highly regulated process, which can be developmental-stage or cell-specific, could be responsible for this difference of expression. for example, exon  <dig> may be more prone to skipping in the spleen given the concentration of specific trans-acting splicing regulators. this could be a way to downregulate the level of fah transcript, by producing an alternative transcript, which is further eliminated by nmd. indeed recent in silico analyses and observations on splicing factors have suggested that nmd, when coupled to alternative splicing, could regulate gene expression  <cit> . del <dig> could be another example of such a coupling of alternative splicing and nmd. in such a case, del <dig> would not be expected to play any function in the cell.

very low levels of proteins can sometimes have enormous effects. interestingly, 10â€“30% of nonsense transcripts escape nmd and when associated with polysomes are stable  <cit> . is the coupling of alternative splicing with nmd in order to degrade the unproductive isoform the only option? an alternative, as proposed by neu-yilik et al.  <cit> , may be that nmd could function in quantitatively controlling the expression of low amounts of protein. in this view, the ptc-containing del <dig> transcript may produce a protein with a physiological, although still unknown, function in the cell. the fah structure contains a c-terminal part of  <dig> residues, which presents a novel arrangement of Î²-strands and plays a functional role in ca2+ binding, dimerization and catalysis of its substrate, fumarylacetoacetate  <cit> . many of the residues encoded by exon  <dig> are part of the Î²-strands and residue  <dig> serves to bind the ca2+  <cit> . the del <dig> protein, which lacks these residues, is thus very unlikely to function in catalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds. while the function of del <dig> is unknown at this time, it may have a function in tyrosinemia. indeed, not all mutations affecting the fah gene will similarly affect the del <dig> protein. for example, mutations affecting exons downstream of exon  <dig> will affect fah production but not that of the del <dig> protein. this might be reflected in the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in hti patients  <cit> . preliminary computer analyses of del <dig> motifs using proscan at pbil suggest that it contains a putative dna-binding motif . whether del <dig> can function as a regulating factor remains unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
nmd was first envisaged as a mechanism to prevent the accumulation of faulty transcripts, arising from mutations or processing abnormalities. recent in vivo observations and in silico analyses have suggested a new role of nmd in gene expression regulation, when coupled to alternative splicing. we report here the identification of an alternative nonsense transcript of the fah gene, which despite being subjected to nmd, produces a protein in different human tissues. this provides an interesting starting point for the analysis of the role of nmd in the regulated productive splicing and translation.
