BACKGROUND
aneurysm and dissection are major diseases of the aorta and are often asymptomatic until a life-threatening event like ischemic organ damage or rupture occurs. marfan syndrome  is a diverse yet clinically recognized subgroup of people at risk for aneurysm, including dissecting aneurysm, and constitutes a significant fraction  of all individuals with ascending and thoracic aortic aneurysmal disease. mfs incidence is estimated to be  <dig> in 5– <dig>   <cit> . our long-term goal is to develop an assay that will identify people at risk for aneurysm before the disease process has reached an advanced state. this report is a small step in that direction.

in this study, we focus on individuals diagnosed with marfan syndrome. the prevalence of mfs combined with its clinical recognition makes it an excellent model system for studies on aneurysmal disease. mfs is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin- <dig>  gene  <cit> , with more than  <dig> unique mutations identified  <cit> . fbn <dig> mutations show a high degree of penetrance but considerable inter- and intra-familial variability in their phenotype  <cit> . the variable penetrance suggests that environmental factors and/or disease modifying genes also contribute to the phenotype. neonatal mfs correlates to mutations within exons 24– <dig> and mfs defined by mutations in exons 59– <dig> carry a reduced risk of aortic pathology. large-scale comparisons between mfs individuals with premature termination mutations and cysteine substitutions in fbn <dig> revealed significant differences in ocular, skeletal and hypermobility features but no difference in the frequency of ascending aortic aneurysm  <cit> . apart from these observations, determining the nature of the mutation  does not improve prediction of the severity of the disease, the risk of aneurysm development or of its progression  <cit> . these limited genotype-phenotype correlations suggest that genes other than fbn <dig> may significantly influence the phenotype, and their identification may lead to a more informative test of risk.

fibroblasts are not smooth muscle cells. however, in culture they display a stable phenotype with stress fibers composed of cytoplasmic actins and a splice variant of cellular fibronectin  <cit> . the increased mechanical stress on dermal fibroblasts seeded at low density produces a cell culture population consisting of 70–80% myofibroblasts. the term "myofibroblast" was proposed over  <dig> years ago to describe the fibroblasts that appeared in granulation tissue at the sight of open wounds  <cit> . recently, it has been recognized that thy- <dig> surface expression defines a subpopulation of fibroblasts capable of differentiating into myofibroblasts  <cit> . we can detect thy- <dig> expression in both affected and unaffected skin fibroblasts by array and have confirmed that observation by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction . thus, the skin cultures we used were "myofibroblast" like.

in the last several years, use of dna microarrays to analyze gene expression has emerged as a promising technology for disease classification and prognosis and for identification of genes that could be potential causes, bio-markers or drug targets  <cit> . however, there are limits to the sensitivity of microarrays for detecting genes expressed at low levels as well as additional confounding problems associated with arrays  <cit> . consequently, in common with most recent studies  <cit> , we go beyond mere classification by independently validating expression levels using quantitative qrt-pcr and validating the results in a second population.

in the present study, we used total rna in oligo dt primed cdna reactions to identify an expression phenotype associated with the mfs genotype in cultured skin fibroblasts. our results show a clearly recognizable expression phenotype in cultured fibroblasts. we of course do not expect exactly the same expression phenotype in aortic smooth muscle cells, but we do expect some overlap in the perturbed pathways, as they share the same root cause. some of the identified genes, including elastin and several collagens, are obvious targets for roles in the development and maintenance of the extracellular matrix environment and cell-matrix contacts. additional genes validated by qrt-pcr analysis, including the vitamin d receptor, programmed cell death- <dig> and the lim domain only  <dig>  may represent genes that will provide new insight into the disease process. our ability to detect a mfs expression phenotype in cultured fibroblasts provides both a simple method for large-scale screening and a basis for mechanistic studies of the genes identified as differentially expressed.

RESULTS
an overview of our experimental design is shown in figure  <dig>  in brief, we analyzed total rna from  <dig> subjects by spotted membrane dna macroarray. we used research genetics spotted cdna membrane arrays to analyze gene expression in fibroblast cultures,  <dig> with characterized mutations in the fbn <dig> gene  and  <dig> unaffected controls . we selected differentially expressed genes between mfs and unaffected samples based on estimated false discovery rate  <cit> . we calculated the  <dig> p-values for the two-sample t-tests associated with the expression differences between affected and control for each gene on the array. at a q-value  threshold of  <dig> ,  <dig> genes  out of a total of  <dig> are selected as differentially expressed in mfs vs. unaffected. the top ranking genes based on ratio are listed in table  <dig> . at the same q-value threshold, we found  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between missense and unaffected samples, and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  between nonsense and unaffected samples. the q-values are only approximate, since their validity depends on various assumptions such as normality of the expression levels within groups. to globally assess the reliability of these test results while making fewer statistical assumptions, we performed a permutation test  to determine if the large number of significant genes we found could easily have arisen by chance. of  <dig>  random permutations for mfs and unaffected samples, no permutations have more than  <dig> differentially expressed genes, making the array results highly statistically significant, with an empirical p-value smaller than  <dig> . furthermore, the only permutations exhibiting a substantial number of significant genes were those permutations that happened to separate most of the mfs subjects from most of the unaffected controls. over forty five thousand permutations showed no significant genes, and the average number called significant was only  <dig> , making it very likely that our estimated false discovery rate of  <dig>  is conservative. 
twenty-one previously described mfs affected subjects with identified fbn <dig> mutations  <cit>  and  <dig> additional affected subjects  representing  <dig> different mutations in the fbn <dig> gene were studied. sixteen additional mfs affected subjects  volunteered. their clinical phenotype was consistent with mfs as determined by a group of examining physicians at the national marfan foundation annual conference. uc 1– <dig> are unaffected control subjects recruited from dermatology clinics. the total rna from primary skin fibroblast cultures was characterized by two different technology platforms that detect gene expression differences: dna array  and quantitative rt-pcr . the thirty-two additional subjects  were added for the validation phase of the study.

unigene id identifies significant, differentially expressed genes based on expression ratio criteria. the top  <dig> down regulated and  <dig> up regulated genes are included. the normalized intensity  from the phosphorimager scan is listed to give a sense of the expression range. the q values are computed based on t test p values. in this and subsequent tables, we show all ratios less than  <dig> as reciprocals. the entire  <dig> gene list has been deposited into geo , accession number gse <dig> 

quantitative rt-pcr
we performed duplicate quantitative rt-pcr assays on total rna from  <dig> subjects  to measure the concentration of  <dig> mrnas . we chose  <dig> genes based on the degree of ratio change, small q-value and the availability of applied biosystems predetermined assay reagents . we included two additional genes, gusb and tbp as internal references. behaviors of these genes in the array are summarized in table  <dig>  the qrt-pcr data for a given subject are generally positively correlated with the array results for the same  <dig> genes from the same rna sample, with a mean spearman  correlation of  <dig>  . figure  <dig> summarizes qrt-pcr results for all  <dig> subjects, and table  <dig> additionally summarizes qrt-pcr results for the array and new subjects separately.

we selected  <dig> genes for validation based on their performance on the array. column headings are as in table  <dig>  except pdar: applied biosystems predetermined assay reagent identifier.

column 2: average mfs/uc ratio from array experiments. remaining columns: ratios of geometric mean transcript abundances of mfs affected vs unaffected control for three subject groups, and wilcoxon p values for the null hypothesis of no between group differences. the three groups are:  "array subjects":  <dig> of the original  <dig> array subjects ;  "new subjects":  <dig> new subjects including  <dig> mfs based on clinical criteria and  <dig> unaffected controls; and  "all subjects":  <dig> mfs affected compared to  <dig> unaffected .  bold: array validation or significant p value . italic: significant p-value but difference opposite to the expected direction. n/a: see text. the bottom section of the table provides a summative assessment: the  p-value of the observed number of significant qrt-pcr validations  under the null hypothesis of no between-group differences.

it is noteworthy that the expression values in the qrt-pcr assays do not appear to be normally distributed. e.g., box-and-whisker plots of normally distributed data analogous to figure  <dig> would be expected to show less than 1% of the samples as "outliers" , whereas figure  <dig> has  <dig>  times as many outliers among the uc samples and  <dig>  times as many among mfs samples . in response to this apparent non-normality, we used the non-parametric wilcoxon rank sum test to evaluate the significance of gene expression differences between groups, a more conservative choice than the usual t-test in such a circumstance. under the null hypothesis that data for the two groups are sampled from the same  continuous distribution, the test is sensitive to a shift in the location  of the distributions .

the two genes marked n/a show marginally statistically significant changes in array subjects but very highly significant changes in the opposite direction in new subjects. one of these genes is fibrillin- <dig>  the key gene implicated in mfs. in our array experiments, fbn <dig> was significantly repressed  and qrt-pcr confirmed that its  mean level was  <dig>  fold lower in mfs based on  the same subjects . however, qrt-pcr shows that in "new subjects" this gene is significantly more highly expressed in mfs than controls . viewed another way, over all subjects, the difference in mean fbn <dig> levels between affected and unaffected subjects is not statistically significant, but  <dig> of  <dig> mfs subjects have values more extreme than the most extreme value in the unaffected samples . it seems likely that mfs subjects exhibit considerable heterogeneity in fbn <dig> mrna levels and our original and new subject populations may not be equivalent samples. as was previously shown, nonsense mutations lead to nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant mrna and reduced fibrillin protein synthesis  <cit> . on the other hand, all the known fbn <dig> missense mutations used in this study are cysteine substitutions in calcium-binding egf domains. fbn <dig> transcript levels and fibrillin protein synthesis were normal in these cells  <cit> . as the distribution of mutations types in the second set of clinically identified mfs subjects is unknown, they may not replicate the distribution of the two mutation classes in the original mfs subjects. an additional factor is a difference in cell culture passage number. nearly all the uc and all new mfs subjects were used at passage  <dig> while the original mfs cultures were used between passage  <dig> and  <dig>  the second gene marked n/a in table  <dig> is procollagen c-endopeptidase , another gene with a clear mechanistic role in maintenance of the extracellular matrix  <cit> . it is plausibly co-regulated with fbn <dig>  showing a moderately strong correlation to fbn <dig> in our qrt-pcr data. given these uncertainties as to the homogeneity of our subject population with respect to these two genes, we considered that overall ratios and p-values were potentially misleading; hence we chose to omit them.

a surprising result of the qrt-pcr measurements, evident in figure  <dig> and analyzed in more detail in table  <dig>  are the variability of expression of these genes, both in unaffected and especially in mfs subjects. we looked at both the full range of the data and at the interquartile range . in general, most genes in uc samples show interquartile ranges of at most 3-fold, with two showing roughly 4-fold changes . iqr for mfs samples is similar, with a slight tendency to higher variability  and a few dramatic exceptions . variability is more pronounced over the full range. in the uc samples the majority vary by 16– <dig> fold, and one by more than  <dig> fold. mfs subjects show greater variability than uc samples in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> genes. the least variable gene  changes by more than 64-fold across mfs subjects, the majority vary by more than 225-fold, with some  showing subject-to-subject differences exceeding 1600-fold. controlling for age, sex, or missense/nonsense mutations did not reduce the marked variability.  could not be tested.)

for the  <dig> genes validated by qrt-pcr, we summarize variability across  <dig> uc and  <dig> mfs samples. interquartile range: fold change between the 25th and 75th percentiles. full range: fold change between the most extreme pair of samples. #outliers: number of outliers . if the data were normally distributed, approximately 1% of the points would so identified, i.e., on average  <dig>  per gene for uc and  <dig>  per gene for mfs samples.

for the long term, this variability emphasizes the importance of studies involving carefully targeted and/or large subject populations, and of developing simple assays for relevant phenotypic predictors, since small samples may be non-representative. for the purposes of the present study, variability complicates interpretation of the results for similar reasons. for example, in our previous discussion of fbn <dig> we remarked that it did not meet our criterion for a statistically significant shift in expression level in the "all subjects" grouping, although it remains likely that fbn <dig> level is influenced by mfs status and specific types of fbn <dig> mutations. similar remarks apply to other genes, where increased variability across mfs subjects suggests these genes are involved in disease processes, but not by a mechanism that consistently elevates or consistently represses expression. these large variations in expression may limit the extent of our interpretations and will require more focused studies and/or additional statistical power before an association with the mfs phenotype can be established firmly. alternatively the expression distribution might be influenced by other factors such as the genotypes of fbn <dig> or disease modifying genes that we have not yet identified.

discussion
we conducted a small-scale gene expression analysis in mfs affected subjects. we hypothesized that subsets of the expression phenotype might indicate genetic and epigenetic factors that are causal or predictive of the mfs diseased state, and more generally, of the aneurysmal state. to conduct this test, we hypothesized that primary cultures of skin fibroblasts derived from punch biopsies could be a simple, robust model. an important advantage to using this system is the ability to collect samples from large numbers of both affected and unaffected subjects. fibroblasts express fbn <dig>  and distinct fibrillin protein phenotypes have been identified in fibroblast cultures from mfs individuals  <cit> . the protein profiles have been linked to distinct classes of fbn <dig> mutations and clinical phenotypes  <cit> .

we used spotted membrane dna array screening to identify gene expression changes associated with fbn <dig> mutations. the most important outcome of this study is the identification of a small number of differentially expressed genes that distinguished skin fibroblasts of mfs affected individuals from the fibroblasts of unaffected controls. our dna array experiments identified a subset of genes that were validated in a new group of subjects. due to the size of our study we chose to focus on the expression pattern of affected vs. unaffected and chose  <dig> genes for validation.

we can speculate on how a number of the validated genes could contribute to the mfs phenotype in a mechanistic way. mfs is a heritable fibrillinopathy where defects in the synthesis and/or assembly of fibrillin- <dig> microfibrils lead to impairment in the elastic fibrils that confer resilience and recoil in elastic tissues  <cit> . for over a decade it was thought that the microfibrillar component of elastic fibers provided a three-dimensional scaffold for the assembly of elastin in the process of elastogenesis  <cit> . the histopathological abnormalities of aneurysmal vessels include abnormal extracellular matrix protein accumulation, fragmentation and disorganization of the elastic fibers in the medial layer of the vascular wall, and a generalized loss of elastin content  <cit> . analysis of mouse models of fibrillin- <dig> deficiency suggested that the primary defect is not in elastogenesis but rather in elastic fiber homeostasis  <cit> . characterization of the mouse model led to a model of acquired elastolysis  <cit>  with evidence suggesting that the altered elastic fiber structure could change the expression phenotype of the underlying vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in the increased expression of several proteases. a number of investigators have identified the association of specific types of fbn <dig> mutations with an increased susceptibility to protease digestion  <cit>  and with the ability of fbn <dig> fragments to up regulate protease expression in culture  <cit> . in contrast, our study identifies elastin as one of the most significantly regulated genes in the affected cell lines. surprisingly, elastin mrna is markedly decreased  suggesting a very early defect in elastogenesis that starts at the level of elastin transcription or the regulation of elastin message stability. interestingly, the vitamin d receptor was also significantly decreased in mfs subjects . vitamin d is known to decrease elastin mrna by decreasing message stability in cultured cells  <cit> . vitamin d treatment also is known to decrease both elastin content and the number of elastic lamellae in the aortas of animals treated pre and post-natally  <cit> .

recent publications have also described an increasing role for transforming growth factor beta  in the expression of the mfs phenotype. mutations in both tgf-beta receptors have been identified in humans with heritable forms of aneurysm  <cit> . in a mouse model of mfs the mutant phenotype includes developmental abnormalities of the distal alveolae of the lung, associated with increased tgf-beta protein and activity  <cit> . our arrays did not detect any significant difference in tgf beta expression level, while a related family member, inhba, was not validated by the qrt-pcr analysis. more recently, tgf-beta antagonists, including a neutralizing antibody to tgf-beta and losartan  were able to prevent and reverse aneurysmal progression in the same mouse model  <cit> . we found significant differences in the expression of a number of genes in this pathway including vdr  and tsc <dig> . the vitamin d receptor  is a negative regulator of tgf-beta transcriptional activation  <cit>  and as mentioned above is significantly decreased in mfs skin fibroblasts. in contrast, the tuberous sclerosis complex  <dig> , a potent activator of tgf-beta transcription, is expressed more highly in mfs fibroblasts . another gene, lmo <dig>   <cit>  is induced by tgf-beta and is significantly elevated in mfs fibroblasts . the behavior of all three genes is consistent with enhanced tgf-beta activity that could contribute to the aneurysmal phenotype if smooth muscle cell loss or differentiated phenotype contributes to the pathological process.

our data also identify several matrix metalloproteases, including adam <dig> , mmp <dig>  and the metalloproteinase inhibitor timp <dig> , with significant differences in expression between the unaffected and affected group. several collagens including col 3a <dig> , col1a <dig>  and the lysine hydroxylase plod <dig>   are also significantly changed. the appearance of these genes suggests a broad change in the extracellular fibrillar structure and composition in affected cells. many of these matrix proteins and modifying enzymes are regulated by tgf-beta.  <cit> .

pdcd <dig>  is increased in the mfs samples . pdcd <dig> was recently identified as one of three genes responsible for a heritable form of cerebral cavernous malformations  characterized by abnormally enlarged capillary cavities causing seizures and hemorrhages  <cit> . these vascular malformations appear to result from a failure in vascular morphogenesis and/or remodeling. in ccm, the endothelial tubes continue to expand and stabilizing pericytes are not recruited. the result is a vessel with an enormously dilated lumen and increased fragility  <cit> .

when we initiated these studies we had two important concerns. first, a priori, it is not obvious that cultured skin fibroblasts would exhibit significant expression differences for other genes in mfs subjects. however, the skin is one of the connective tissues affected in mfs, and our experiments confirm a significant mfs expression phenotype in cultured fibroblasts. the second concern is that these differences may not be relevant to aneurysmal disease, believed to be largely a disease of smooth muscle cells. obviously, we cannot be sure that the gene changes discovered in fibroblasts are the same gene changes found in aortic smooth muscle cells, but, given that the two cell types share commonalities in their morphology, extracellular matrix environment and the common fibrillin defect, it is reasonable to suspect that they also share some relevant core changes in fibrillin-related pathways. while our fibroblast study cannot answer this question, it did identify some differentially expressed genes whose known roles are suggestive of involvement in smc tissue failure. a third concern arose during the course of the study – namely, the large sample-to-sample variation in gene expression levels. this variability needs to be recognized as an important confounding factor in expression analysis studies. it also supports our decision to use skin fibroblasts rather than aortic smc as our sample source.

CONCLUSIONS
our ultimate goal is to use genome-wide expression analysis to identify and classify people at risk for developing aneurysms of the ascending thoracic aorta. our preliminary data support the idea that there are common mechanisms triggered by mutations in fbn <dig> that lead to identifiable differences in gene expression between unaffected control and mfs affected cultured fibroblasts. some of these changes appear to be downstream from tgf-beta activation. while the limited phenotype described here is only a partial description of the potential "mutation associated" expression profile, the results suggest that a complete genomic screen of several hundred mfs vs. unaffected cell lines, using fbn <dig> mutation detection, microarray expression analysis and qrt-pcr validation of possible biomarkers, could lead to the identification of genes that contribute to the mechanistic events that initiate vessel wall destruction.
