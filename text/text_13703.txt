BACKGROUND
throughout their life cycle plants are affected by various abiotic stresses, such as drought, extreme temperature, high salt concentration and cold, and these cause notable yield reductions in agriculture worldwide. the genetically determined level of freezing tolerance is achieved during cold acclimation, which is a relatively slow, adaptive response during autumn, when the temperature, day length and light intensity usually decrease gradually  <cit> . two main signalling pathways ensure the reprogramming of the plant metabolism in arabidopsis during this process; one is dependent on abscisic acid , whereas the other is not  <cit> . in the aba-independent pathway the c-repeat binding factor/dehydration-responsive element binding factor  plays a central role both in arabidopsis and in crop species, including wheat  and barley   <cit> . at least  <dig> different cbf gene-coding sequences were mapped at the fr- <dig> locus of chromosome 5a in wheat, and cbf <dig> has been found to be one of the most effective ones in increasing freezing tolerance both in wheat and barley  <cit> . cbfs are characterized by a plant-specific apetala2/ethylene-responsive element binding domain   <cit> , which interacts with the c-repeat elements present in the promoter region of their target genes. these are cold-regulated  genes making up the cbf regulon, the activation of which increases freezing tolerance. one of these genes, cor14b, is well characterized in barley and wheat  <cit> . it is differentially expressed in freezing-sensitive and freezing-tolerant genotypes, and helps to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from photo-oxidative damage during exposure to high-intensity light at freezing temperatures.

the decreasing temperature during autumn also fulfils the vernalization requirement of winter cereals and ensures the correct timing of the vegetative/generative transition and the protection of freezing-sensitive flowers  <cit> . in contrast, spring cereals do not require any cold treatment to induce flowering. allelic differences in the main wheat vernalization genes vrn <dig>  vrn <dig> and vrn <dig> determine the timing of the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. the mads-box transcription factor vrn <dig> promotes flowering by inhibiting genes in the vrn <dig> locus  <cit> . the vrn <dig> locus contains two genes, zcct <dig> and zcct <dig>  that are both involved in flowering repression  <cit> . vrn <dig> encodes a raf kinase inhibitor-like protein that displays a high degree of sequence identity to arabidopsis flowering locus t  protein  <cit> . the ft protein is a long-distance flowering signal that moves from the leaves to the apices through the phloem and promotes flowering  <cit> . the interactions between these three genes and their possible effect on freezing tolerance have been recently reviewed  <cit> .

the coordinated regulation of vernalization and cold acclimation has been demonstrated in wheat, since vrn <dig> allelic variation influences the duration of the expression of low temperature-induced genes  <cit> . in particular, mutations in the vrn <dig> promoter, resulting in high vrn <dig> transcript levels under both long and short days dampen the expression of the cor genes and lower freezing tolerance, especially under long-day conditions  <cit> . in addition, maximum freezing tolerance usually coincides with vernalization saturation in barley  <cit> . thus, the hypothesis of vrn <dig> pleiotropy would explain the fact, long known to breeders, that winter-type genotypes of wheat and barley carrying a vernalization-sensitive  allele at the vrn <dig> locus are more freezing-tolerant than spring-type cultivars. another link between the regulation of vernalization and the stress response exists through the nuclear factor y complex  consisting of a, b and c subunits. an interaction between nf-yb and zcct  proteins has been detected in wheat  <cit> , and nf-y has also proved to be involved in tolerance to abiotic stress in arabidopsis <cit> . the nf-y complex may affect the stress response through its interaction with the bzip proteins controlling aba signalling, as shown in arabidopsis <cit> .

freezing tolerance and initial development of flower primordia, like many adaptive and developmental processes, are under redox control in plants  <cit> . unfavourable environmental conditions induce oxidative stress  <cit> . reactive oxygen species , such as superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen may accumulate to toxic levels, leading to serious injury or plant death because of redox imbalance  <cit> . however, a moderate increase in the ros level may activate various defence mechanisms through redox signalling pathways  <cit> . the enzymatic and non-enzymatic compounds in the antioxidant system may be affected, including ascorbate and glutathione, which are the heart of the redox hub  <cit> .

alterations in ros and antioxidant levels are not only induced by various environmental effects, but may also occur during the growth and development of plants. tissue-, cell- and compartment-specific spatial and temporal variations in their levels are especially important. one of the most important antioxidants is glutathione , which is a multifunctional metabolite that interacts with several molecules through thiol-disulphide exchange and de-glutathionylation and also participates in detoxification, defence, metabolism, redox signalling and the regulation of transcription and protein activity  <cit> . changes in the amount and ratio of gsh and gssg affect cellular reducing capacity and half-cell reduction potential, which can be used as stress markers  <cit> . the biosynthesis of gsh was stimulated by low temperature in wheat, and this change was greater in freezing-tolerant genotypes than in sensitive ones  <cit> . after  <dig> weeks of cold treatment there was a correlation between the h2o <dig>  ascorbate and glutathione contents, the ascorbate/dehydroascorbate  and gsh/gssg ratios, glutathione reduction potential and freezing tolerance in wheat  <cit> . besides their involvement in cold acclimation, ascorbate and glutathione are also involved in vernalization. the flowering time of asa-deficient arabidopsis mutants was shifted substantially  <cit> . the overexpression of the first enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis led to earlier flowering and an increased gssg level even at optimal growth temperature  <cit> . a similar alteration was only observed in wild-type arabidopsis at 4°c. thus, it was suggested that an increase in gssg content or changes in the reduction potential of glutathione partially mimicked seed vernalization treatment  <cit> . alterations in the gssg content may influence flowering time through the oxidative stress <dig>  transcription factor  <cit> .

based on the cited results it was hypothesized that changes in the redox potential of glutathione may affect freezing tolerance and the initial development of flower primordia in wheat. it could be predicted that the pharmacological modification of the redox state of glutathione and its precursors would modify the thiol-dependent redox potential in winter wheat genotypes even at optimum growth temperature and in spring wheat genotypes only at low temperature, since the latter usually activate the protective mechanisms after stronger environmental effects. this hypothesis was tested by comparing freezing tolerance and the initial development of flower primordia after the pharmacological modification of the glutathione redox state in one winter and one spring wheat genotype. the effect of redox changes on the expression of genes related to freezing tolerance and the initial development of flower primordia was studied.

RESULTS
changes in the amount and redox state of thiols
twelve-day old seedlings  were treated with various reductants , oxidants  and osmotica  for  <dig> d at 20/17°c  as a pre-treatment in order to modify the concentration of the reduced and disulphide forms of thiols and their redox state. the treatments were also continued on the first  <dig> d of the subsequent cold treatment at 5°c in order to compare the effect of the various compounds at optimal and low growth temperature. the effect of the chemicals on the alteration of the redox environment was monitored by determining the concentration of thiol disulphides and their reduction potential in the crown. the crown plays a special role in cold acclimation and vernalization, since winter wheat genotypes regenerate from this organ after frost damage, and the crown is the place where the very sensitive flower primordia are formed. treatment with  <dig> and  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> mm gssg and  <dig> mm asa at 20/17°c decreased the cysteine  content, and increased the amount of cystine , the percentage of cyss and the half-cell reduction potential of the cysteine/cystine couple  compared with the control in the winter wheat ch . in contrast, in the spring wheat tsp the cys concentration increased, whereas the content and percentage of cyss and the ecys/cyss value decreased after the majority of the chemical treatments. however,  <dig> mm gsh and  <dig> mm asa did not affect and  <dig> mm asa decreased the cys content;  <dig> mm asa did not change the percentage of cyss and increased the ecys/cyss value in tsp. when the temperature was decreased from 20/17°c to 5°c, the cys content was only decreased and the cyss concentration and the ecys/cyss value were only increased by  <dig> mm gssg compared with the control in ch . however, at 5°c the cys content decreased, and the cyss concentration and percentage and the ecys/cyss value increased after almost all of the treatments compared with the control except after  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig>  mm gssg,  <dig> mm asa and nacl in tsp. among the applied compounds h2o <dig> and peg had significant effects on the amount and redox state of cysteine at both temperatures in tsp.

most of the treatments, except for 1mm gsh and  <dig> mm h2o <dig> increased the amount and percentage of hydroxymethylglutathione disulphide  and the half-cell reduction potential of the hmgsh/hmgssg couple  compared with the control at 20/17°c in ch. the hmgsh content was increased and the ehmgsh/hmgssg value was decreased by  <dig> mm asa, h2o <dig>  nacl and peg in tsp . in addition,  <dig> mm gsh decreased the ehmgsh/hmgssg value and  <dig> mm gsh increased it together with the gssg content in tsp. at low temperature a great decrease in hmgsh content and an increase in hmgssg percentage was observed compared with the control except after the addition of both concentrations of gsh in ch . the ehmgsh/hmgssg value was increased by  <dig> mm gssg,  <dig> and  <dig> mm asa, h2o <dig> and peg in ch. the hmgsh content decreased and the ehmgsh/hmgssg value increased compared with the control, except after h2o <dig>  nacl and peg application at 5°c in tsp.

the gsh content was decreased and the gssg concentrations and the egsh/gssg value were increased by  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig>  and  <dig> mm gssg,  <dig> mm asa and nacl compared with the control at 20/17°c in ch . there was only a slight change, if any in the amount and redox state of glutathione in tsp. consequently, there were great differences between the two genotypes for these parameters after treatment with  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig>  and  <dig> mm gssg,  <dig> mm asa and nacl. at low temperature the percentage of gssg was high in control plants, after  <dig> mm gsh and  <dig> and  <dig> mm gssg and  <dig> mm asa treatments, but was lower than in the control following treatment with  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> mm asa, h2o <dig> or osmotica in ch . the percentage of gssg was increased by most of the treatments except after  <dig> mm asa, the amount of gssg was increased and the concentration of gsh was decreased by  <dig> mm gsh, h2o <dig> and peg compared with the control at 5°c in tsp. the egsh/gssg value was decreased by  <dig> mm gsh and increased by  <dig> mm gsh in ch and it was increased by  <dig> mm gsh, h2o <dig> and peg in tsp compared with the control.

effect of the compounds on fresh weight
fresh weight was determined at the same sampling points as the thiol levels after  <dig>  and  <dig> days  of chemical treatment. most of the applied compounds had no effect on fresh weight after  <dig> d at 20/17°c . the fresh weight of the shoots was not affected  and the fresh weight of the roots was reduced  by almost all the treatments compared with the control at 5°c in ch . in contrast to ch, the fresh weight of the shoots was significantly increased by all compounds, whereas the fresh weight of roots was increased by  <dig> mm gssg, h2o <dig> and nacl at 5°c in tsp .

redox regulation of gene expression
the expression of the genes related to freezing tolerance and the initial development of flower primordia was determined after  <dig> d treatment with the various compounds . figure  <dig> shows the expression changes observed for the genes involved in the control of freezing tolerance. in ch the cbf <dig> transcript levels exhibited a decrease after treatment with  <dig>  mm gssg,  <dig> mm asa and 15% peg, and an increase after the addition of  <dig> mm gssg compared with the control . in tsp the cbf <dig> expression was strongly reduced except after  <dig> and  <dig> mm gsh and  <dig>  mm gssg treatments. comparing the two genotypes, cbf <dig> transcription was lower in tsp than in ch after all the treatments, except after both concentrations of gsh,  <dig>  mm gssg and 15% peg. the expression of cor14b was not affected by most of the treatments  in ch but was decreased by most of them  compared with the control in tsp . two- to four-fold differences were observed between the two genotypes with higher transcript levels in ch. the transcription of adenosine-5′-phosphosulphate reductase  was not significantly affected by the treatments in ch, but was increased by  <dig>  mm gssg and  <dig> mm asa in tsp compared with the control . the transcript levels of apsr were at least 10-fold greater in ch than in tsp. the expression of the stroma ascorbate peroxidase <dig>  gene was increased by  <dig> and  <dig> mm asa and nacl in ch, and by  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig>  and  <dig> mm gssg and h2o <dig> in tsp compared with the control . the sapx <dig> transcript levels were at least 2-fold greater in ch than in tsp after most treatments, except after  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> and  <dig> mm gssg and h2o <dig>  the expression of the gene encoding a cold-responsive ca-binding protein  was only reduced by  <dig> mm gssg,  <dig> mm asa and peg in ch; however, in tsp it was lower after most treatments compared with the control except after both concentrations of gsh and gssg treatments . cab expression was 2- to 3-fold greater in ch than in tsp except after  <dig> mm gssg. to establish whether the effect of the applied chemicals on freezing tolerance was mediated by aba, the expression of the gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , the regulatory enzyme of aba synthesis was measured. its expression was increased by  <dig> mm asa and peg in ch and by  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> mm gssg and peg in tsp compared with the control . the transcript level of nced <dig> was greater in tsp than in ch after most of the treatments except after  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> mm asa, h2o <dig> and peg.

among the genes controlling the initiation of the flower primordia, the expression of the flowering repressor zcct <dig> was not affected by  <dig> and  <dig> mm gsh, gssg and 15% peg, but was reduced by the other treatments in ch, whereas it was reduced by most of the treatments in tsp except after  <dig> and  <dig> mm gsh and h2o <dig> compared with the control . a significant difference between the two genotypes in zcct <dig> transcription was only observed after the addition of  <dig>  and  <dig> mm gssg and 15% peg. the transcript level of the zcct <dig> gene generally decreased in both genotypes compared with the control except after  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig>  and  <dig> mm gssg and  <dig> mm asa in ch, and this change was much greater in tsp . in contrast to zcct <dig>  the expression of zcct <dig> differed greatly between ch and tsp after treatment with redox agents and osmotica. it was at least 2-fold greater in ch than in tsp except after nacl and peg addition. the transcription of vrn <dig> was not affected by either concentration of gsh or by gssg, but was increased 2- to 4-fold by the other treatments in ch compared with the control . the expression of vrn <dig> was induced by most of the compounds except after  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> mm asa and peg in tsp. the transcript levels of vrn <dig> were 2- to 10-fold greater in tsp than in ch. the transcripts of vrn <dig>  which is a positive regulator of flowering were not present at a detectable level in the crowns. the expression of oxidative stress <dig> , which controls stress-induced flowering was greatly induced by  <dig> and  <dig> mm asa, nacl, h2o <dig> and peg in ch and by  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> mm asa and nacl in tsp compared with the control . the transcript level of oxs <dig> was higher in tsp than in ch after the addition of  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig>  and  <dig> mm gssg and  <dig> mm asa. the transcription of flavin-binding kelch-repeat-box <dig> gene , another regulator of flowering time was induced by  <dig> mm asa, nacl and peg in ch and by  <dig> mm gsh in tsp compared with the control . the expression of fkf <dig> was greater after  <dig> mm asa, nacl and peg addition in ch and after the application of  <dig> mm gsh in tsp compared to the other genotype. the transcript level of the stress-responsive nf-yb <dig> was increased by most treatments, except after  <dig>  and  <dig> mm gssg and h2o <dig> compared with the control in ch . the expression of nf-yb <dig> was elevated by  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig>  and  <dig> mm gssg and nacl and decreased after  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> mm asa, h2o <dig> and peg treatments in tsp. greater transcript levels were detected after the addition of  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> mm asa and peg in ch and after treatment with  <dig>  and  <dig> mm gssg in tsp compared with the other genotype.

redox control of freezing tolerance
freezing tolerance was tested by measuring the electrolyte leakage as an indicator of membrane damage after freezing of the leaf segments of the cold-hardened plants  at different temperatures. the temperatures for freezing and the 2°c difference between them were based on previous results  <cit> . the compounds applied improved freezing tolerance as shown by the decrease in electrolyte leakage at both temperatures compared with the control except for  <dig> mm gssg and  <dig> mm asa at -11°c in ch . they reduced the tolerance as indicated by the increase in electrolyte leakage except after  <dig> mm gsh,  <dig> mm gssg, h2o <dig> and nacl treatments at 11°c in tsp. the damage suffered by the freezing-sensitive spring wheat tsp was lethal even without chemical treatment at -13°c. the test was also carried out at -15°c, but the electrolyte leakage was almost 100% even in the freezing-tolerant genotype after all treatments indicating the high damage of cell membranes .

effect of redox treatments on the initial development of flower primordia and h2o <dig> accumulation in the shoot apices
the initial development of flower primordia was monitored by investigating shoot apex morphology at the end of the 3-week recovery period. this process was not affected in ch and was accelerated by most of the treatments in tsp . the shoot apices of ch were in developmental stages 0– <dig>  both with and without chemical treatment. however, in tsp the control apices were in stage  <dig>  in which the spikelet primordia enlarge, whereas after the addition of the various compounds the apices were in stages 5– <dig>  which are called the ‘empty and lemma glume primordia’ stages. the isolated apices were stained with the green fluorescent dye h2dcfda in order to investigate the peroxide concentration at the end of the 3-week recovery period. this was slightly increased by both concentrations of asa and gsh and by  <dig> mm gssg in ch, and was decreased by most of the chemicals except after  <dig> mm asa and nacl in tsp .

discussion
modification of the redox state of thiols
it was shown that the redox state of the thiols was modified by the addition of reductants, oxidants and osmotica to the nutrient solution in hydroponically grown wheat seedlings. the redox state of glutathione was affected not only by gsh and gssg, but also by asa, h2o <dig>  nacl and peg, indicating that this modification was not a simple feed-back control of its synthesis or reduction by the substrate, but part of a more general redox control process. asa and h2o <dig> may affect the redox state of glutathione through the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, whereas nacl and peg may influence it through the osmotic stress-induced accumulation of h2o <dig>  changes in the gssg content and egsh/gssg value, which were closely correlated with each other  were only observed at optimal growth temperature in the freezing-tolerant ch but not in tsp after treatment with the various compounds, leading to great differences in these parameters between the treated seedlings of the two genotypes. at 20/17°c the egsh/gssg value was generally increased significantly by the treatments in ch compared to the control, whereas there was no significant change in tsp. however, if the chemical treatments were combined with cold , the egsh/gssg value exhibited a similar general change in tsp like the one observed for ch at 20/17°c, whereas it was partly restored to the value detected before the cold treatment in ch. these differences between the two genotypes may be due to the different levels of antioxidants before the treatments, as shown by the higher gssg content and egsh/gssg value in ch compared to tsp, and result in the different expression of genes related to freezing tolerance and the initial development of flower primordia in the two genotypes. this is supported by the fact that a change  in the egsh/gssg value similar to that observed for wheat in the present study dramatically decreased the seed viability of four plant species  <cit> .

besides gluthathione, the other two thiols, cysteine and hydroxymethylglutathione may also modify the cellular redox environment, and consequently the structure and activity of redox-responsive molecules  <cit> . however, changes in the redox state of glutathione may have the greatest effect on the redox environment, since its concentration was 3- to 4-fold greater than that of hydroxymethylgluthione and 10-fold greater than that of cysteine. the importance of the maintenance of the appropriate glutathione redox state is also indicated by the contrasting effect of  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm gsh on the redox state of cysteine and glutathione. this difference may be explained by the gsh sensitivity of the key enzyme of cysteine synthesis, adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase <cit> . accordingly, we assume that it is not affected by the  <dig> mm gsh concentration, but may be severely inhibited by the  <dig> mm gsh concentration. consequently, the amount of cys which is the precursor of gsh, as well as the gsh concentration will be reduced by  <dig> mm gsh. the marked increase in cyss and gssg may be explained by the severe inhibition of cysteine reductase and glutathione reductase by  <dig> mm gsh  <cit> .

it should be mentioned that at 20/17°c the various compounds added only induced an increase in the concentration of the disulphide forms and half-cell reduction potential of glutathione and the two other thiols in ch. at 5°c, however, the redox state of both gsh and cysteine was similar in the two wheat genotypes, but in tsp the percentage of hmgssg was only 1–2%, and the total level  was decreased to 20–30% of the control value after the majority of the treatments. by contrast, the ratio of hmgssg was increased  by nearly all treatments at 5°c in ch. based on this difference between the winter and spring wheat genotypes, the hmgsh/hmgssg couple may have a special role in the regulation of the redox-responsive molecules involved in cold acclimation and the initial development of flower primordia in poaceae, where hmgsh is a homologue of gsh .

the influence of cold on redox changes described earlier  <cit>  was intensified when combined with various chemical treatments in the present study, both in ch and tsp. both the combined application of cold and various redox agents and cold treatment alone had a greater effect on the redox system in ch than in tsp, and there was a strong correlation between freezing tolerance and redox changes  <cit> . the effect of exogenous gsh on tolerance to low temperature was also shown in tobacco  <cit> . in addition, peg-induced osmotic stress resulted in greater changes in the amount and redox state of glutathione in a tolerant wheat genotype than in a sensitive one  <cit> .

the redox state can be modified not only by various pharmacological compounds  <cit> , but also by the overexpression or inhibition of the related enzymes. thus, the increased expression of a gene encoding an enzyme with both glutathione s-transferase and glutathione reductase activities affected the amount of glutathione and its redox state in tobacco  <cit> . changes in the activity of these and other enzymes may lead to the oxidation of gsh and indirectly to that of other compounds involved in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, and to changes in the cellular redox potential  <cit> . similar redox changes were described in mutants deficient in ascorbate and glutathione or in the enzymes involved in the reduction of their oxidised forms, leading to an increase in the cytosolic redox potential compared to wild-type plants  <cit> . similarly to the pharmacological modification of the redox state, the use of hypomorphic mutants or rnai transgenic lines would also allow the cellular redox environment to be modified gradually, thus facilitating the study and promoting the understanding of its regulatory role.

although monitoring the endogenous redox changes induced by various environmental effects makes it possible to clarify their role in growth, development and the stress response, the pharmacological modification of the levels of various redox components is an important tool to obtain additional information about their participation in these processes, as shown in the case of chilling in maize  <cit> .

redox control of freezing tolerance
the importance of endogenous redox changes during cold acclimation and their correlation with freezing tolerance was shown in wheat seedlings  <cit> . the exogenous application of redox compounds and osmotica induced a great increase in oxidized thiols and simultaneously increased freezing tolerance in the winter wheat genotype ch, but not in the spring genotype tsp. comparing the effect of the various compounds tested, it can be concluded that, rather than having specific effects, the individual compounds have a similar influence on the ascorbate-glutathione cycle and on the redox potential of the gsh/gssg couple, resulting in an improvement in freezing tolerance. the increase in the amount of gssg could be important in this process, since the higher tolerance of transgenic tobacco seedlings to salt and chilling stress was also related to the elevated gssg concentrations  <cit> . changes in the amount and ratio of gsh and gssg may influence the metabolism through the thiol/disulphide conversion or the glutathionylation of proteins, which modifies their activity. changes in the cys/cyss and hmgsh/hmgssg ratios may have a similar effect on proteins and subsequently on freezing tolerance as shown by the different effects of  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm gssg on the ratio of disulphide forms and subsequently on freezing tolerance in tsp. the redox potential of glutathione showed a moderate correlation with freezing tolerance  in ch , whereas there was no correlation in tsp  , indicating that the redox changes induced by the various treatments tested only improved freezing tolerance in the winter genotype.

a model was created to explain the different responses of the two genotypes to various redox agents and osmotica, based on differences in egsh/gssg values, gene expression, freezing tolerance and the initial development of flower primordia, and on correlations between these parameters . based on correlation analysis , the different effects of the chemicals on the egsh/gssg values in the two genotypes  may contribute to the zcct <dig> transcript level’s being, on the average, 2-fold higher in ch than in tsp at 5°c. this difference in zcct <dig> transcript levels may be responsible for its different effect on freezing tolerance and the initial development of the flower primordia in the two genotypes. interestingly, such a difference in zcct <dig> expression between the two genotypes was only observed after few treatments. the expression of zcct <dig> and zcct <dig> exhibited similar correlations with the transcript levels of the other genes. the redox sensitivity of zcct <dig> was also shown in another wheat genotype, chinese spring, in which a short treatment  with h2o <dig> resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in its expression . according to a recent paper zcct <dig> and zcct <dig> expression is inhibited by vrn <dig> <cit> . the negative correlation found between the expression levels of these genes in both genotypes was close in ch and moderate in tsp. the great increase in vrn <dig> transcript level generally observed was associated with a great reduction in zcct <dig> transcript level after the majority of chemical treatments in tsp, whereas the decrease in zcct <dig> transcription was only moderate for the winter wheat ch. thus, the higher expression level of zcct <dig> in ch is inferred to have been sufficient to keep the plants in the vegetative developmental phase. correlation analysis showed that the greater transcript level of zcct <dig> was also associated with a higher expression of cbf <dig> and its target genes in ch compared to tsp . although the expression of cbf <dig> was only higher than the control after  <dig> d treatment with gssg at 5°c, differences were found for cor14b and sapx <dig> after several treatments. interestingly, although gssg increased the transcription of these genes, gsh did not, an observation which is consistent with the results obtained in tobacco, where a relationship between gssg content and stress tolerance was found  <cit> . due to interactions between the nf-y and zcct <dig> regulatory proteins  <cit> , nf-y may also be involved in the control of cold-responsive genes through cbf <dig>  the negative correlation between cbf <dig> and nf-yb  suggests that cbf <dig> may be associated with the inhibition of nf-yb, which in turn may have a similar effect on zcct <dig>  forming a feed-back regulatory loop between flowering time regulation and the cold response, as suggested for arabidopsis, with the involvement of the cbf <dig>  soc <dig> and flc genes   <cit> . this whole loop is controlled by the egsh/gssg, which may have a positive effect on zcct <dig> and a negative influence on nf-yb at 5°c in ch based on our correlation analysis . the latter may form a link between the aba-independent and aba-dependent regulation of cold-responsive genes by controlling nced <dig>  which encodes a key enzyme of aba synthesis. this hypothesis is in agreement with previous data  <cit> . earlier experiments showed that redox changes may affect aba signalling directly, independently of zcct <dig> and nf-y <cit> . although in the present experiment the expression of nced <dig> was not correlated with the egsh/gssg value, it was in close correlation  with the transcription of the apsr and sapx <dig> genes. the very close correlation  observed in ch between the apsr and sapx <dig> transcript levels can be explained by their coordinated regulation through the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. a correlation between redox changes and freezing tolerance-related genes was also shown in tsp . there was a very close positive correlation between zcct <dig> and both cbf <dig> and cor14b, and a close correlation between zcct <dig> and cab expression. cab was also closely correlated with cbf <dig>  cor14b and apsr. however, these genes had low expression in tsp, which may be explained by the low zcct <dig> transcript level, which resulted in freezing sensitivity. the relationship between freezing tolerance and differences in the gene expression profile was also shown by the comparison of substitution lines of tsp and ch involving chromosome 5a   <cit> . in a macroarray experiment, about  <dig> genes were only affected by the 5a chromosome of tsp and about  <dig> only by that of ch. there was a difference in the transcriptome of the two genotypes even before cold treatment. an even larger difference can be assumed between tsp and ch in the present experiment, since differences between the two genomes are not restricted to chromosomes 5a, like in the case of the substitution lines. thus, different gene sets appear to be the target of the redox changes in the two genotypes. correspondingly, genes related to cold acclimation were expressed to a much greater extent in the freezing-tolerant ch than in the freezing-sensitive tsp after the various treatments tested.

redox control of the initial development of flower primordia
in contrast to the improvement of freezing tolerance in ch, a different adaptive strategy was observed in the spring genotype tsp after the various treatments, involving an accelerated growth of the shoots and roots and a quicker initial development of the flower primordia. the changes observed after the combined application of cold and the various compounds were accompanied by increased gssg content, which was also involved in the initiation of flowering in arabidopsis <cit> . the importance of the fine regulation of gssg content is also indicated by the stronger effect of its higher concentration on the initial development of flower primordia in tsp in the present experiment. the redox changes depending on the redox state of glutathione may be important developmental signals affecting the whole metabolism and, consequently, the growth and development of plants. as in wheat, the involvement of asa in controlling the initial development of flower primordia was also shown in arabidopsis, where flowering was delayed in asa-deficient mutants under long-day conditions  <cit> . whereas in an earlier study the developmental stage of the flower primordia did not correlate with the endogenous level of various antioxidants during the 3-week cold hardening  <cit> , the exogenous application of redox agents accelerated the initial development of flower primordia during the recovery period after growth at low temperature. this contradiction can be explained by the different redox processes occurring during cold treatment and the subsequent recovery, or by the more drastic effect of exogenous redox compounds. the concentrations and oxidation levels of ascorbate and glutathione may affect the flowering time via the control of h2o <dig> levels through the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. this assumption is confirmed by the present findings, since the effect of exogenous h2o <dig> on the initial development of flower primordia was similar to that of gsh and asa. in addition, a correlation was found between ascorbate peroxidase activity, h2o <dig> level and flowering time when an ascorbate peroxidase-deficient mutant was compared to wild-type and overexpressing arabidopsis plants  <cit> . the mutants, which had the highest h2o <dig> content, flowered first and the transgenic plants with the lowest h2o <dig> content last. osmotica may also induce h2o <dig> accumulation and subsequently to stress-induced early flowering  <cit> . the importance of h2o <dig> in the control of flowering at the gene expression level was shown by transcriptome analysis in arabidopsis, where h2o <dig> increased the expression of a constans-like protein  <cit> . the genetic basis of stress-induced early flowering was recently described in plants  <cit>  and the results were used to elaborate a model for the redox regulation of flowering  <cit> .

based on the present experiment, gsh-dependent redox changes inhibit zcct <dig> transcription to a greater extent in tsp than in ch . from the negative correlation between zcct <dig> and vrn <dig> transcript levels in tsp, it can be supposed that the decrease in zcct <dig> expression may be associated with the increased expression of vrn <dig> in the present experiment. the repression of zcct <dig>  by vrn <dig> was reported in a recent study  <cit> . zcct <dig> may control vrn <dig> transcript levels through its interaction with nf-yb in a regulatory loop, in which nf-yb may have a positive effect on vrn <dig> expression  <cit>  . as a result of this regulation possibility, vrn <dig> expression was much greater in tsp after the majority of the treatments compared to the control. vrn <dig> might have a positive effect on oxs <dig> and fkf <dig>  which are positive regulators of flowering. according to our hypothesis this led to an accelerated initial development of shoot apices, shown by the more developed flower primordia of seedlings treated with redox compounds and osmotica compared with the control. although correlation analysis did not reveal any relationship between the expression of zcct <dig>  oxs <dig> and fkf <dig> in wheat , zcct <dig> may activate oxs <dig> and fkf <dig> through nf-yb and vrn <dig>  interestingly, the effect of redox changes  on oxs <dig> expression may be mediated by aba based on correlations between egsh/gssg value and nced <dig> transcript levels . this assumption is supported by the results obtained in arabidopsis, where aba and oxs <dig> were found to have an effect on drought-induced early flowering under long-day growth conditions  <cit> . besides having a stimulating effect on the initial development of flower primordia, the increased vrn <dig> expression in tsp may also be responsible for the decrease in freezing tolerance, because of the inhibition of cold-responsive genes  <cit> . the coordinated regulation of flowering and tolerance to low temperature was also described in arabidopsis <cit> . the redox control of the initial development of flower primordia was shown not only in tsp but also in ch, where the low expression of oxs <dig> and fkf <dig>  may be associated with the higher zcct <dig> transcript level, as indicated by the negative correlation between zcct <dig> and the other two genes . consequently, the initial development of flower primordia was delayed. the effect of aba on flowering was also indicated by the close correlations between nced <dig>  oxs <dig> and vrn <dig> in ch.

CONCLUSIONS
the application of redox-altering compounds  differentially affected the gssg content and the egsh/gssg values, and consequently the expression of the flowering repressor zcct <dig>  in the two genotypes. the much greater expression of zcct <dig> in ch compared with tsp after the various treatments was associated with the much lower expression of vrn <dig>  the major regulator of the initial development of flower primordia, and with greater expression of genes increasing freezing tolerance. however, the much smaller zcct <dig> transcription  in tsp compared to ch was associated with much greater vrn <dig> expression and much lower transcript levels of the genes related to freezing tolerance. based on the correlation between the expression of genes related to the initial development of flower primordia and cold acclimation improving freezing tolerance, a model was constructed to illustrate the coordinated control of the two processes. the effect of the various redox-altering compounds is mediated by alterations in gssg concentrations and the egsh/gssg value in the proposed model, in which zcct <dig> has a central regulatory role.
