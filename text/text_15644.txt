BACKGROUND
gliomas are the most common malignant tumors in the adult central nervous system and account for  <dig> to 60% of primary brain tumors. these cancers exhibit a relentless malignant progression characterized by widespread invasion throughout the brain, and thus usually result in a poor prognosis  <cit> . although multiple genetic alterations are involved in the development and progression of malignant gliomas  <cit> , epigenetic silencing of wild-type tumor suppressor genes via aberrant promoter hypermethylation has also been shown to occur  <cit> . aberrant promoter methylation of cpg island-associated genes is a common epigenetic alteration associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor and other genes in human cancers  <cit> . unmethylated in normal tissues, promoters of these genes can become methylated de novo in cancer cells. this change is accompanied by alterations in histone modification and chromatin conformation, rendering the promoter transcriptionally inert  <cit> .

such epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the inactivation of several key regulators of the cell cycle , dna repair , apoptosis , angiogenesis , and invasion  in glioma  <cit> . recently, novel hypermethylated genes in glioma have been identified using a candidate gene approach or by a genome-wide screening method. the former revealed that genes such as emp <dig>  tms1/asc, slc5a <dig>  hmlh and pten are frequently targeted for dna methylation-mediated silencing in glioma  <cit> . a genome-wide screen using a combined approach of pharmacologic inhibition of epigenetic modifications and gene expression microarrays also revealed that several novel genes are subject to aberrant hypermethylation in glioma  <cit> . thus, aberrant methylation events have become critical to our understanding of the initiation and progression of human brain malignancies and may serve as a biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis and susceptibility to treatment.

leucine-rich repeat c <dig> protein  is a new member of the leucine-rich repeat  superfamily located at 7q31- <dig>  <cit> . it was found to be predominantly expressed in normal brain tissue and involved in early nervous system development and differentiation  <cit> , but the expression of lrrc <dig> was absent in several malignant glioma cell lines  <cit> . similarly, it was absent or significantly down-regulated in  <dig> % of primary glioma biopsies  <cit> . more importantly, lrrc <dig> had the potential to suppress tumorigenesis of u <dig> malignant glioma cells in vivo and cell proliferation in vitro  <cit> . recent studies show that lrrc <dig> can block u <dig> cells in g0/g <dig> and induce u <dig> cell-growth arrest and differentiation by down-regulating the erk/akt/nf-κb, stat <dig> and jnk2/p-c-jun/p <dig> signaling pathways  <cit> . therefore, the loss of lrrc <dig> function may be an important event in the progression of gliomas and may act as a novel candidate for tumor suppression. however, little is known about the mechanism of lrrc <dig> expression loss or down- regulation in glioma cell lines and biopsies. no known studies have found genetic alterations in the lrrc <dig> coding sequence in glioma biopsies or cell lines  <cit> . this lack of findings led us to explore an alternative mechanism underlying inactivation of lrrc <dig> in glioma.

in the present study, we cloned the lrrc <dig> promoter with characteristics of a cpg island. then, cpg methylation status around the lrrc <dig> promoter region in glioma cell lines and primary gliomas was examined by methylation-specific pcr and bisulfite dna sequencing. in order to demonstrate a functional association between lrrc <dig> promoter methylation and its gene inactivation, we performed dna demethylation analysis with two human glioma cell lines using methylation-specific pcr and rt-pcr.

methods
cell lines and tumor samples
thirty fresh tumor samples were collected after informed consent was obtained from patients who underwent brain operations for glioma at xiangya hospital . the samples were snap-frozen immediately following resection and stored in liquid nitrogen until processing. the  <dig> male and  <dig> female patients were aged from  <dig> to  <dig> years . tumors were graded and classified according to the world health organization , including astrocytoma , grade ii-iii ), oligodendroglioma ), oligoastrocytoma ), and glioblastoma )  <cit> . for comparison, normal human tissues from patients without cancer were obtained at the time of autopsy.

human glioblastoma-derived cell lines sf <dig> and sf <dig> were obtained from the cell research institute of peking union medical college  and cultured in minimal essential medium . cos <dig> and hela were obtained from american type culture collection and maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium . all cells were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and  <dig> ug/ml streptomycin and cultured at 37c with 5% co <dig> 

cloning and analysis of the lrrc <dig> 5' upstream regulatory region
the lrrc <dig> promoter region in the 5' end of humans was predicted using the promoterinspector and promoterscan programs. the cpg island was found using cpgplot from the european molecular biology open software suite. to obtain the 5' flanking region of the lrrc <dig> gene, pcr amplification was performed on human genomic dna . after an initial denaturation step , the pcr reactions were carried out for  <dig> cycles at 94°c for  <dig> sec, 62°c for  <dig> sec, and 72°c for  <dig> min, with a final extension of  <dig> min at 72°c. the pcr product was purified using a gel purification kit and cloned into the t/a cloning vector pgemt-easy . positive clones of pt/a-2475/- <dig> were isolated and sequenced.

luciferase-reporter plasmid constructs and assay
the 5' upsteam regulatory region of the lrrc <dig> gene was subcloned into the kpni and bgl ii restriction sites of the pgl3-enhancer vector . construct naming is based on the position of the promoter fragments . four deletion constructs of the lrrc <dig> promoter region were created , originating from the construct pgl <dig> -2475/- <dig> by pcr amplification using the primers listed in table  <dig>  sense primers for generating the reporter constructs described above contained an adaptor with a kpni restriction site  at the 5' end. anti-sense primers contained an adaptor with a bgl ii restriction site . the promoter fragments were then subcloned into the kpni/bgl ii sites of the pgl <dig> enhancer vector and sequenced.

transfection was performed with lipofectamine™ reagent . 5× <dig> cells were seeded in each well of 24-well tissue plates. when cells reached 50–80% confluence, they were cotransfected using  <dig> μg of each dna construct in pgl3-enhancer and  <dig>  μg sv40β-galactosidase vector for normalizing transfection efficiency per well according to manufacturer's instructions. firefly luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates  <dig> h after transfection by using the luciferase assay system  and a luminometer. β-galactosidase activity was measured in cell lysates by the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system . experiments were repeated at least three times with three replicates per sample for each experiment. results are normalized against β-galactosidase activity.

methylation of report plasmid constructs in vitro
pgl3-835/- <dig> report plasmid constructs were methylated in vitro by sssi methylase  treatment following the manufacturer's instructions. cells were transfected by methylated or mock-methylated constructs as described above.

dna extraction and bisulfite modification
genomic dna from cells and tissues was prepared using a dna extraction kit  according to manufacturer's instructions. five hundred nanograms of genomic dna was modified and purified using an ez dna methylation-gold kit , following the manufacturer's protocol. modified dna was used immediately or stored at -80°c for up to six months.

methylation-specific pcr
the methylation-specific pcr primers were designed according to the promoter-active dna sequence using methyl primer express v <dig> . modified dna was amplified by two different primer pairs specific to the unmethylated  and methylated  lrrc <dig> promoter sequences, respectively. for the methylated  sequence, the forward and backward primers were 5'-agcgtagtatttagcgagtgc-3' and 5'-taaaccctaacaccgactcg-3'.

for the unmethylated  sequence, the primers were forward 5'-gggagtgtagtatttagtgagtgt-3' and backward 5'-taaaccctaacaccaactcactc-3'. pcr amplification was performed for a total of  <dig> cycles with an annealing temperature of 58°c. methylation specific pcr products were analyzed by a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.

bisulfite sequencing
in order to cover the whole promoter region of lrrc <dig>  two pcr regions were amplified using primers that avoided cpg sites. for region  <dig>  primers were 5'-gyggattggagaattgattt tt-3' and 5'-aactatacaaatacatacccccccc-3'. for region  <dig>  primers were 5'-gaggggggggtatgtatttgtatagt-3' and 5'-cccaccctcaaaacaaaccc tc-3'. the pcr amplification was performed for a total of  <dig> cycles with annealing temperature of 56°c. pcr products were gel-purified and cloned into the t/a cloning vector pgemt-easy . ten subclones were isolated and identified by double digestion and sequencing.

5'-aza-dc treatment of cell lines
the human glioblastoma-derived cell lines sf <dig> and sf <dig> were grown for  <dig> days in the presence of various concentrations of 5-aza-dc . fresh drug was added every  <dig> h. rna and dna were separately isolated.

rt-pcr
rna was isolated from harvested cells with trizol  reagent and then treated with dnase  to eliminate contaminated dna. reverse transcription of the rna was performed according to the instructions of promega. to amplify lrrc <dig>   <dig> μl of cdna was used for each pcr using the primers, 5'-caacttggcccacaat aacc-3'  and 5'-catccgaccctcagaaatgt-3' . the primers for gapdh were 5'-gtcagtggtggacctgacc t-3'  and 5'-aggggagattcagtgtggtg-3'. the gapdh primers were added to the pcr at the end of the tenth cycle as control experiments. ten microliters of each reaction was then run on 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.

RESULTS
cloning and analysis of the 5' upstream regulatory region
to clone the lrrc <dig> promoter region, a database was searched against the human genomic dna using lrrc <dig>  as the query  to reveal the 5'upstream sequence of the lrrc <dig> gene. several bioinformatics tools were used to identify the potential promoter region of the lrrc <dig> gene. a 605-bp region spanning positions - <dig> to - <dig> was identified as the potential promoter region of the lrrc <dig> gene by using a promoterinspector  <cit> , whereas a 251-bp region located from - <dig> to - <dig> was identified as the lrrc <dig> promoter by using a promoterscan program  <cit> . we detected two cpg islands that spanned positions - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig> using the emboss cpgplot program  <cit>  . finally, a genomic dna fragment that spanned positions - <dig> to - <dig> relative to the initiation codon atg of the lrrc <dig> gene was amplified by pcr. the pcr product was cloned into the t/a cloning vector pgemt-easy  .

functional analysis of the lrrc <dig> promoter by 5' upstream deletion
to identify the promoter region of the lrrc <dig> gene, five constructs of progressive deletion spanning positions - <dig> to - <dig> were generated  and cloned to upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pgl3-enhancer vector . transient transfection experiments were carried out using cos <dig> and hela cells, respectively. the luciferase activity driven by lrrc <dig> promoter constructs was measured  <dig> h after transfection. expression levels were corrected for variable transfection efficiencies by cotransfection with a plasmid directing the β-galactosidase expression.

as shown in figure  <dig>  in cos <dig> and hela cells, luciferase expression driven by the constructs pgl3-2475/- <dig>  pgl3-1483/- <dig>  pgl3-835/- <dig> and pgl3-835/- <dig> exhibited similarly high levels, but the reporter driven by construct pgl3-293/- <dig> showed little luciferase activity. thus, the sequence spanning position - <dig> to - <dig> relative to the translation start site of lrrc <dig> functions as a promoter. methprimer program analysis shows that the lrrc <dig> promoter region has high g/c content  and characteristics of a cpg island  <cit> . in addition, this promoter region has no tata box or caat box.

dna methylation suppresses lrrc <dig> promoter activity
the presence of a cpg island suggested the possibility that the gene might be regulated through changes in the methylation status, which have been shown to cause gene silencing  <cit> . to analyze the effects of dna methylation on promoter activity, lrrc <dig> promoter reporter construct pgl3-835/- <dig> was treated with or without sssi methylase to methylate the promoter in vitro. in vitro-methylated or mock-methylated lrrc <dig> promoter constructs were transfected into cos <dig> and hela cells along with sv40β-galactosidase vector. firefly luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates as shown in figure 3a. it can be seen that lrrc <dig> promoter activity was strongly suppressed by methylation in both cell lines. the same result was verified in sf <dig> and sf <dig> cell lines .

methylation of the lrrc <dig> promoter in glioma cell lines and biopsies
our previous study showed that the expression of lrrc <dig> was absent in glioma cell lines sf <dig> and sf <dig>  <cit> . moreover, dna sequence analysis failed to identify any mutation in the lrrc <dig> coding region, except for one single nucleotide polymorphisms site hat does not affect amino acid sequences  <cit> . to clarify the mechanism of lrrc <dig> inactivation in these two cell lines, methylation-specific pcr was used to examine the methylation status of the lrrc <dig> promoter. both sf <dig> and sf <dig> cell lines showed methylation of the lrrc <dig> promoter. the methylated sequence was obtained and is shown in figure 4a.

to investigate whether aberrant methylation of the lrrc <dig> in glioma cell lines reflects an epigenetic event occurring in primary glioma, we next examined  <dig> primary glioma biopsies and three tissue specimens of normal brain for lrrc <dig> methylation. some methylation analyses are shown in figure 4b. it was demonstrated that the lrrc <dig> promoter was free from methylation in the three normal brain tissue samples, but was methylated to different extents in the  <dig> primary gliomas.

bisulfite sequence analysis of promoter region of lrrc4
to determine a more detailed map of the methylation in the lrrc <dig> promoter, we performed bisulfite sequencing around the promoter region of the lrrc <dig> gene in some of the glioma biopsies and cell lines studied above. in order to cover the whole promoter region of lrrc <dig>  two pcr regions were amplified using primers that avoid cpg sites. region  <dig> spans - <dig> to - <dig> relative to the lrrc <dig> translation start site, including  <dig> cpg sites. region  <dig> covers - <dig> to - <dig> relative to the lrrc <dig> translation start site, including  <dig> cpg sites. bisulfite sequencing of  <dig> individual clones of pcr products of both region  <dig> and region  <dig> from primary glioma biopsies  and cell lines  revealed densely methylated cpgs within the promoter regions compared to normal brain tissue . whereas not all cpgs around the lrrc <dig> promoter are methylated, most of them are in sf <dig> and sf <dig> glioma cell lines. however, in the primary glioma tissue samples , the methylation pattern appeared much more heterogeneous and varied in density in different clones of the same sample. this may be due to mixed cellularity in tissue samples.

5-aza-dc induced the expression of lrrc <dig> in glioma cell lines
in order to demonstrate a functional association between lrrc <dig> promoter methylation and its gene inactivation, a dna demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine , was used to treat sf <dig> and sf <dig> cell lines. by rt-pcr analysis, lrrc <dig> expression was detected after treatment with 5-aza-dc in both cell lines . moreover, lrrc <dig> expression increased with increasing dosage of 5-aza-dc. lrrc <dig> expression was highest when induced by  <dig> μm 5-aza-dc in sf <dig> cells, but in sf <dig> cells lrrc <dig> expression was highest when induced by  <dig> μm 5-aza-dc.

to confirm that reactivation of lrrc <dig> mrna expression in glioma cell lines was caused by demethylation of the lrrc <dig> promoter, methylation-specific pcr was used to detect methylation status changes in the lrrc <dig> promoter in the sf <dig> and sf <dig> cell lines after 5-aza-dc treatment. figure 6b shows that 5-aza-dc results in the partial demethylation of lrrc <dig> 

discussion
inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes plays an important role in malignant brain tumor formation and progression. genetic mechanisms such as mutation, deletion, and structural chromosome rearrangement are known to inactivate tumor-suppressor genes. our previous studies demonstrated that the expression of the lrrc <dig> gene was not only highly specific in brain tissue  <cit> , but also a candidate tumor-suppressor gene that may be involved in the pathogenesis of malignant gliomas. however, no genetic alterations of the lrrc <dig> coding region were found in glioma. based on these data, we speculated that the absence or down-regulation of lrrc <dig> expression in glioma may be caused by the 5' upstream regulatory sequence.

in the present study, we cloned and characterized  <dig> bp  of the 5' genomic region of the lrrc <dig> gene, which shows baseline promoter activity. furthermore, transfection experiments using a series of 5'-deleted constructs demonstrated that the region - <dig> to - <dig> is sufficient to mediate maximal promoter activity. this region can also drive egfp expression in the egfp-reporter plasmid . these results suggest that we have found a function of the lrrc <dig> promoter.

the functional lrrc <dig> promoter region is a tata- and catt- less, high gc content region and has characteristics of a cpg island. this is consistent with brain-specific gene lrrc <dig> since many tissue-specific genes possess cpg islands in regulatory regions  <cit> .

it is well known that aberrant methylation of cpg islands is one of the major modes of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer, and a growing list of genes are being identified as abnormal methylation of promoters having cpg islands  <cit> . here, the lrrc <dig> promoter was found to be methylated in two glioma cell lines  and all  <dig> primary gliomas that we have collected, but not in the normal brain tissue samples, suggesting that lrrc <dig> methylation is a tumor-specific event. furthermore, there was no correlation between clinical stage, sex or age and lrrc <dig> methylation. methylation of lrrc <dig> was detected in both the early and late stages of glioma, indicating that the inactivation of the lrrc <dig> gene might be essential in the early development of glioma and persist through the course of development.

treatment of sf <dig> and sf <dig> cells with 5-aza-dc restored lrrc <dig> expression, which suggests that aberrant hypermethylation of the promoter is directly responsible for transcription inactivation of its expression in glioma cell lines. the molecular mechanism through which dna methylation silences gene expression is not fully understood. dna methylation may directly interfere with the binding of transcription factors, resulting in the transcriptional repression of the associated gene  <cit> . in addition, methyl-binding domains containing proteins  may bind to areas of dense dna methylation and recruit histone deacetylases and transcriptional repressor complexes, which is refractory to transcription  <cit> . bisulfite sequence analysis of the cpg island around the lrrc <dig> promoter reveals dense methylation of cpg sites in glioma cell lines and tissues compared with non-tumor brain specimens . taken together, these findings suggest that promoter methylation is an important mechanism in the inactivation of lrrc <dig> in glioma.

the present study implies that methylation-mediated inactivation of lrrc <dig> is involved in the initiation and development of glioma. since lrrc <dig> promoter methylation is found in glioma but not in the normal brain, it may distinguish tumors from normal tissue and serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosis. our previous study indicated that lrrc <dig> may be an adhesive protein or/and receptor, and it inhibited glioma invasion and metastasis  <cit> . since the ability of invasion and metastasis is closely related to prognosis in glioma, lrrc <dig> methylation may also be a biomarker for prognosis. in addition, our findings demonstrate that methylase inhibitor can reverse lrrc <dig> expression in glioma, and it is possible to restore its function as tumor suppressor gene at some degree. this shows that lrrc <dig> may be a potential target for therapy. of course, all of these hypotheses must be further studied using a large sample analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, methylation-mediated inactivation of lrrc <dig> is a frequent and glioma-specific event that may be a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, or a useful target for therapy.
