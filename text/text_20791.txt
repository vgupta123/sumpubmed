BACKGROUND
subfamily iv of the p-type atpase superfamily is a group of exclusively eukaryotic large multipass transmembrane proteins that appear to function as inward – from the exofacial to the cytofacial monolayer – translocases of the aminophospholipids phosphatidylserine  and phosphatidylethanolamine  and of the choline lipid phosphatidylcholine   <cit> . ps, pe and pc are rather unexpected substrates for these proteins because the "classical" p-type atpases in subfamilies i, ii and iii pump metal cations and protons  <cit> . two lines of evidence suggest that members of subfamily iv translocate aminophospholipids. first, biochemical investigations have determined that heterologously expressed and purified subfamily iv p-type atpases progress through the catalytic cycle and hydrolyze atp in the presence of specifically ps and pe  <cit> . and second, genetic studies have consistently found that deletion of genes encoding subfamily iv members increases exposure on the cell surface of endogenous ps and pe, which are normally mostly concealed, and diminishes translocation to the cytofacial leaflet of exogenously-introduced labeled ps and pe, which are normally quickly internalized  <cit> . evidence for pc as a transported substrate is much less extensive, consisting of observations of labeled pc internalization in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . there is still some skepticism that subfamily iv p-type atpases directly translocate the three phospholipids   <cit>  or that they are directly responsible for internalization of ps, pe and pc   <cit> . however, neither an alternative candidate transported substrate for these atpases nor strong evidence for altered vesicular traffic as the cause of ps, pe and pc exposure on the cell surface in subfamily iv p-type atpase mutants has thus far emerged.

eukaryotic genomes contain many genes encoding p-type atpases in subfamily iv   <cit> . this brings up the questions: why do eukaryotes require so many putative aminophospholipid translocases, what are the individual functions of these genes, and how should these genes be divided into subgroups in order to study them? investigations in the single-cell fungus s. cerevisiae offer some answers. the s. cerevisiae genome includes five subfamily iv p-type atpase genes. one of these, neo <dig>  is essential  <cit> . the remaining four – drs <dig>  dnf <dig>  dnf <dig> and dnf <dig> – are individually dispensable but together comprise an essential subgroup  <cit> . although drs2p resides predominantly in the golgi apparatus  <cit>  and dnf1p and dnf2p reside predominantly in the plasma membrane  <cit> , all three must be deleted for the highest levels of ps and pe exposure on the cell surface  <cit> . these findings imply that a number of subfamily iv p-type atpases must work in concert to efficiently sequester the two aminophospholipids in the cytofacial leaflet  <cit> . when extrapolated to multicellular organisms, in which loss of aminophospholipid transmembrane asymmetry and ps appearance on the cell surface are fatal  <cit> , the yeast paradigm predicts that each somatic cell must express at least two individually nonessential but ubiquitous p-type atpases in subfamily iv: one for the golgi apparatus and one for the plasma membrane.

we have systematically investigated the six, tat- <dig> through  <dig>  p-type atpase subfamily iv genes expressed in the multicellular organism caenorhabditis elegans and found that expression patterns and deletion phenotypes of these genes are inconsistent with the predictions of the yeast paradigm. this does not mean that c. elegans p-type atpases in subfamily iv do not translocate ps and pe. in fact, a recent report shows that loss of tat- <dig> leads to the appearance of ps on the surface of germline and certain somatic cells  <cit> . rather, our findings suggest that individually nonessential subfamily iv members, tat- <dig> through  <dig>  could not accomplish the bulk of aminophospholipid internalization even together as a group and, instead, are specialized to particular tissues, where three of these genes subtly regulate sterol metabolism by, perhaps, adjusting transbilayer lipid distribution. the housekeeping aminophospholipid translocase seems to be encoded by tat- <dig>  a homolog of neo <dig> 

RESULTS
c. elegans animals express six subfamily iv p-type atpases
the c. elegans genome encodes six predicted members of the p-type atpase subfamily iv. the genes are named transbilayer amphipath transporter   <dig> through  <dig> . the four detected splice isoforms of tat- <dig> differ with respect to the final five exons . each isoform has a distinct stop codon and is predicted to generate a product with a divergent c terminus . the five detected splice isoforms of tat- <dig> differ with respect to the first two and the penultimate exons and are predicted to generate four products with some sequence variability at the very n and c termini . only two slightly different isoforms of tat- <dig> were identified . the product of the longer isoform contains a few extra c-terminal amino acids, which are absent in the shorter version. the tat- <dig> locus includes two open reading frames , tat- <dig> and t24h <dig> , which appear to form an operon . t24h <dig> , but not tat- <dig>  cdna could be amplified using a splice leader  <dig>  primer. in c. elegans, trans-splicing to sl <dig> usually indicates that a gene occupies a subordinate position in an operon  <cit> . the tat- <dig> stop codon resides in the same exon as at least three weak polyadenylation signals . bicistronic tat- <dig> and t24h <dig>  messages were detected that terminate with the sole t24h <dig>  polyadenilation signal and likely arise when the three tat- <dig> polyadenylation signals fail to induce poly tail addition. the choice of polyadenylation site affects translation of neither tat- <dig> nor t24h <dig> .

three alternative transcripts of tat- <dig> were detected. tat-5b begins with the sequence from the two short exons located in a close proximity to the upstream orf and undergoes trans-splicing to sl <dig> . tat-5a and tat-5c are almost identical to each other, start with the third exon located over  <dig> kilobases downstream from the first two tat-5b exons and are spliced to sl <dig> and sl <dig>  in addition to trans-splicing to sl <dig>  subordinate cistrons in an operon also usually reside close to the previous orf  <cit> . by these two criteria, tat-5b is a subordinate cistron in an operon. the status of tat-5a/c is less certain. the long sequence from the end of the previous orf to the start of tat-5a/c transcripts could conceivably hold another  cis-acting regulatory element that drives transcription of these two isoforms.

tat- <dig> is 73% identical with tat- <dig>  a tat- <dig> deletion mutant  is reportedly viable. comparatively weak expression of tat- <dig>  evidenced by the paucity of the publicly available cdna clones  <cit>  and low cdna amplification yield , suggests that this gene is a recent poorly-expressed duplicate of the very strongly expressed tat- <dig>  for these reasons, tat- <dig> was not characterized in detail.

p-type atpases in subfamily iv are customarily divided into six classes  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis of these atpases expressed in s. cerevisiae, c. elegans and humans reveals a substantial evolutionary dissimilarity between class  <dig> and the other classes . after the early split between the branch leading to class  <dig> and the branch leading to the rest of the classes, class  <dig> genes have not duplicated significantly. thus, yeast express a single gene in this class , while c. elegans and humans express two class  <dig> genes each . the other branch of the subfamily, in contrast, has quickly undergone multiplication and diversification. this difference in the extent of evolutionary expansion may indicate that the strictly preserved class  <dig> proteins perform some essential function conserved throughout evolution in all eukaryotes, while the frequently duplicating atpases in the other classes rapidly evolve to fill new roles.

tat- <dig> is a housekeeping gene
two tat- <dig> expression cassettes were constructed . in the tat-5b::nls::gfp cassette, a region of the operon promoter drives transcription of a sequence encoding a nuclear localization signal -tagged green fluorescent protein . in tat-5a/c::nls::gfp, nls-gfp is under the control of a fragment spanning the second tat- <dig> intron. the cassettes were introduced into the nematode genome via particle bombardment. two transgenic lines – one integrated  and one extrachromosomal  – carrying tat-5b::nls::gfp transgenes were isolated . in both lines gfp fluorescence emanates broadly from all inspected tissues at all developmental stages, except very early embryos and the germline . one integrated line  carrying tat-5a/c::nls::gfp transgenes was identified. gfp signal could not be detected in lcis <dig>  embryos or hermaphrodites. these findings suggest that the operon promoter alone controls tat- <dig> transcription. the ubiquitous pattern of tat- <dig> expression revealed using the reporter is fully supported by in situ staining data from the nematode expression pattern database . thus, tat- <dig> is a ubiquitously expressed gene.

n <dig>  animals fed tat- <dig> double-stranded rna  in order to suppress tat- <dig> via rna interference  bore dead embryos showing signs of extensive necrosis . some eggs still in the uterus of tat- <dig> hermaphrodites also seemed to disintegrate . similar tat- <dig> phenotypes  have been detected in systematic rnai screens for genes whose suppression causes clear morphological and developmental abnormalities  <cit> . the three deletion mutants of tat- <dig>  are also reportedly homozygous lethal . being ubiquitously expressed and essential for survival, tat- <dig> has the characteristics of a housekeeping gene.

tat- <dig> through  <dig> exhibit developmentally-regulated tissue-specific expression patterns
two integrated and three extrachromosomal transgenic lines carrying tat-2::nls::gfp expression cassettes were made by particle bombardment . with the exception of a few instances of ectopic transcription in the extrachromosomal lines, all five generally exhibit nearly identical patterns of reporter expression. curiously, gfp fluorescence in the tat-2::nls::gfp transgenic nematodes emanates not from the nucleus, as would be expected with an nls-tagged reporter, but mostly from the plasma membrane region . apparently, the short tat-2-coding fragment that is retained in the tat- <dig> expression cassette "overpowers" the nls and directs the chimeric reporter peptide to the plasma membrane compartment.

tat- <dig> reporter is first clearly detectable in 2-fold stage embryos in two sets of pharyngeal cells, the developing pharyngeal-intestinal valve and a set of cells in the posterior . by the first larval  stage, gfp fluorescence also appears in the intestine . l <dig> and adult animals exhibit reporter signals in unidentified cells of the pharyngeal procorpus, the gland cells located in the posterior bulb of the pharynx, the pharyngeal-intestinal valve, rectal gland cells, the intestine and all cells of the excretory system . tat- <dig> reporter signals are also seen in l <dig> larvae in the primary vulval lineage vule and vulf cells and in the proximal gonad . the vulval fluorescence vanishes and a moderately strong uterine signal appears after the uterine-vulval connection is complete in adults . the gonadal signal, emanating from spermatids, migrates to the spermatheca around the time of the first ovulation .

three integrated and ten extrachromosomal transgenic lines carrying tat-3::nls::gfp cassettes were derived . four of these  were investigated in detail and found to exhibit nearly identical expression patterns. tat- <dig> reporter signal first appears in embryos in the developing pharynx . in the fully formed alimentary system, very strong gfp fluorescence is observed in the muscle, marginal and buccal epithelial cells of the pharynx, the pharyngeal-intestinal valve and, with lesser intensity, the rectal epithelial cells . seam cells display very strong fluorescence as soon as this lineage becomes established during embryonic development . in adults, moderate to weak fluorescence seems to arise from the xxx cells, some unidentified cells in the head and tail regions and the hypodermis . in the reproductive system, tat- <dig> reporter expression begins in the distal tip cells  in l <dig> and in the anchor cell  in early l <dig> . gfp signal is later visible in the dividing progeny of the vulval precursor cells . in late l <dig>  the anchor cell fuses with the uterine seam cell , which does not express the reporter . the vulval cells continue exhibiting moderate fluorescence into the adulthood .

four integrated and six extrachromosomal tat-4::nls::gfp transgenic lines were derived . five of these lines  were investigated in detail. notable tat- <dig> reporter expression begins in 2– <dig> fold embryos in the developing pharyngeal-intestinal valve and unidentified cells at the posterior . in the fully formed alimentary system, gfp fluorescence emanates strongly from the pharyngeal-intestinal valve, rectal gland cells and the intestine . tat- <dig> reporter is also expressed in the uterus, during spermatogenesis in the proximal gonad and in the spermatheca of previously ovulated adults .

the available from nextdb  <cit>  in situ staining images corroborate expression of tat- <dig> in the pharynx and vulva, of tat- <dig> in the spermatheca, intestine, pharyngeal-intestinal valve and uterus and of tat- <dig> in the intestine. tat- <dig> expression pattern could not be obtained because three near perfect inverted repeats located in the 5' end of the tat- <dig> locus destabilized expression cassette vectors . however, images from nextdb show that tat- <dig> is also expressed tissue-specifically. thus, tat- <dig>  tat- <dig>  tat- <dig> and, likely, tat- <dig> all appear to be expressed in developmentally regulated tissues-specific patterns .

expression pattern of tat- <dig> could not be determined by our method of choice, and tat- <dig> was excluded because this gene appears to be a recent poorly expressed duplicate of tat- <dig> 

tat- <dig> through  <dig> are nonessential under regular growth conditions
tat- <dig> through  <dig> expression patterns show that these proteins are present in critical tissues during key periods of the nematode development. to determine whether curtailing expression of tat- <dig>  tat- <dig>  tat- <dig> or tat- <dig> would lead to gross morphological and developmental abnormalities, n <dig> animals were fed dsrna against the four genes. tat- <dig>  tat- <dig>  tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> animals did not exhibit a notable developmental or morphological defect . however, staining of germ line apoptotic cells with annexin v-gfp, a peptide that binds specifically ps, was altered in tat- <dig> hermaphrodites  <cit> , suggesting that rnai against tat- <dig> did suppress its target.

while the rnai studies were being conducted, deletion mutants of tat- <dig> through  <dig> became available. tat- <dig> , tat- <dig>  and tat- <dig>  are very likely null . tat- <dig> lacks an n-terminal exon encoding  <dig> amino acids present in all isoforms, but may still be partly functional . tat- <dig>  tat- <dig>  tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> single and tat-4; tat- <dig> double mutants are all viable.

to determine whether deletion of tat- <dig> through  <dig> exerts a negative effect on nematode growth and reproduction, synchronized mutant and n <dig> larvae were followed through developmental stages, and the viable progeny of the adult hermaphrodites were counted. wild-type, tat- <dig>  tat- <dig> and tat-4; tat- <dig> animals were essentially indistinguishable from one another in both the timing of progression through the developmental stages and the number of viable progeny produced by hermaphrodites . tat- <dig> mutants passed through development slightly slower than un-mutated larvae. this is evident in the lower and higher number of tat- <dig> offspring produced during, respectively, the first and the last sampling period, in comparison with the numbers of n <dig> progeny. around 20%  of tat- <dig> hermaphrodites had notably fewer progeny than the rest of animals of the same genotype. this is reflected in the large standard deviation value for this mutant. however, pair-wise statistical analysis  shows that the total number of viable hatchlings for neither tat- <dig> nor tat- <dig> mutants was significantly different from the corresponding number for n <dig> animals . overall, deletion of tat- <dig>  tat- <dig>  tat- <dig> or tat- <dig> individually and tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> together does not seem to impair nematode development or reproduction to a significant degree under regular growth conditions.

tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> mutant animals are hypersensitive to sterol deprivation
c. elegans is a sterol heterotroph that uptakes various exogenous sterols and converts these compounds to 7-dehydrocholesterol  <cit> . the latter metabolite is a precursor of dafachronic acids, a hormone that promotes reproductive growth  <cit> . sterol uptake and conversion to 7-dehydrocholesterol occurs in the intestine  <cit> , while dafachronic acids are synthesized primarily in the hypodermis  <cit> . if subfamily iv p-type atpases tat- <dig> through  <dig> facilitated a step somewhere along the sterol transport pathway – from the site of exogenous sterol uptake to the site of 7-dehydrocholesterol conversion to dafachronic acids, then tat- <dig> through  <dig> mutants would exhibit sterol deprivation hypersensitivity evident in decreased reproductive growth.

the solid support medium for routine nematode growth contains sterols from the substances used in its preparation and is also supplemented with cholesterol to the final concentration of  <dig> ng/ml  <cit> . the combined amount of sterol in the medium is more than sufficient for optimal nematode growth: n <dig> animals can grow just as well on plates enriched with cholesterol to  <dig> ng/ml  <cit> . to determine whether tat- <dig> through  <dig> mutants are hypersensitive to cholesterol deprivation, test plates were specially prepared to eliminate all exogenous sources of sterol and then supplemented with cholesterol to the final concentrations of  <dig> ng/ml,  <dig> ng/ml,  <dig> ng/ml or  <dig> ng/ml. op <dig> strain escherichia coli cultures were grown in a synthetic defined medium without sterol, then supplemented with cholesterol to the same concentrations as the plates. test plates were spotted with a bacterial culture of the same cholesterol concentration. the resultant food lawns on the test plates were almost identical in size. eggs from gravid hermaphrodites grown on regular full-sterol plates were collected using the alkaline hypochlorite method, hatched overnight on no-sterol plates, and then the hatchlings were transferred to test plates,  <dig> per plate . the first generation larvae on the test plates grew to maturity and reproduced because these animals contained reserve sterol deposited into oocytes by the mothers maintained on the regular high supply of the nutrient  <cit> . the second generation lacked sterol reserves and exhibited notable effects of sterol deprivation.

growth of n <dig> animals on the test plates was proportional to the amount of cholesterol in the medium . by the fifth day, n <dig> populations on  <dig> ng/ml and  <dig> ng/ml cholesterol plates cleared all bacterial food and began starving. this indicates that the first generation animals produced plenty of viable progeny and that the second generation grew quickly without significant mortality. n <dig> populations on  <dig> ng/ml cholesterol plates cleared food on day  <dig>  by this same time, n <dig>  <dig> ng/ml cholesterol plates still contained plenty of food and fewer and much smaller second-generation animals.

tat- <dig> populations grew on the test plates at the same pace as the wild-type populations. in contrast, tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> populations exhibited a much more dramatic retardation of growth . food on tat- <dig> and tat- <dig>  <dig> ng/ml cholesterol plates was cleared on day 7: two days later than on the same cholesterol concentration n <dig> and tat- <dig> plates. significantly, on  <dig> ng/ml and lower cholesterol concentration plates, growth of the second generation tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> larvae progressed minimally. this is evident in slight, if any, changes in the size of tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> populations and individual animals from day  <dig> to  <dig> . tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> mutants did not appear to suffer from a particular developmental or morphological defect but rather respond to sterol limitation more dramatically than n <dig> and tat- <dig> animals. furthermore, the developmental delay exhibited by tat- <dig> animals on the sterol-limited test plates was much more severe than the mild lag in development these mutants showed on regular plates. tat- <dig> populations also exhibited severe growth retardation on sterol-limited test plates . since it is unlikely that three independently derived deletion alleles in two related genes would contain secondary mutations that cause an identical phenotype, mutagenesis of specifically tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> seems to induce hypersensitivity to sterol deprivation.

tat-4; tat- <dig> double mutants are more sensitive to sterol availability than tat- <dig> single mutants
the above data suggest that tat- <dig> is not a major player in sterol metabolism; however, the gene is expressed in the hypodermis, a major steroidogenic tissue  <cit> , and in the pharynx, a potential sterol storage organ  <cit> . to test whether tat- <dig> contributes marginally to sterol metabolism, tat- <dig> mutants were crossed with tat- <dig> mutants to derive a double mutant of the two genes. tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> expression patterns overlap only in the pharyngeal-intestinal valve , and in terms of development and reproduction under regular conditions, tat-4; tat- <dig> animals are indistinguishable from n <dig> nematodes . on sterol-deprivation test plates, double mutants of the two genes performed worse than tat- <dig> nematodes . tat- <dig> populations were noticeably larger than tat-4; tat- <dig> populations by day  <dig> on  <dig> ng/ml cholesterol concentration plates. by day  <dig> on the same plates, tat- <dig> animals cleared all food, while there were still plenty of bacteria to consume for the double mutants. growth was minimal on  <dig> ng/ml and lower cholesterol concentration plates for both tat-4; tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> animals during the 9-day observation period. thus, it seems deletion of tat- <dig> exacerbates sterol-deprivation hypersensitivity of tat- <dig> mutants.

discussion
specialization and redundancy among the c. elegans putative aminophospholipid translocases

eukaryotic genomes contain many genes encoding subfamily iv p-type atpases  <cit> . the need for such an abundance of these genes per organism and their individual functions are presently poorly understood. closely related genes may be at least partly redundant or they may be functionally highly specialized. the c. elegans genome includes six, tat- <dig> through  <dig>  genes whose protein products are p-type atpases in subfamily iv. the data presented here indicate that tat- <dig> encodes the sole ubiquitously expressed and essential subfamily iv p-type atpase. tat- <dig> phenotype is dramatic: sterility and embryonic lethality; furthermore, tissues of tat- <dig> embryos exhibit extensive necrotic cell death. these observations suggest that tat- <dig> performs a very critical housekeeping function. together with the yeast neo1p  <cit> , which is also essential, tat- <dig> segregates in class  <dig>  the most ancient class of p-type atpases in subfamily iv. thus, it seems that class  <dig> genes encode highly specialized subfamily iv p-type atpases that execute a critically important housekeeping function.

individual deletion of the remaining c. elegans subfamily iv p-type atpase genes, tat- <dig> through  <dig>   does not grossly impair c. elegans growth and development. this would be consistent with a high degree of redundancy among these genes. however, an analysis of expression and involvement in sterol metabolism exhibited by tat- <dig> through  <dig> suggests a different explanation. while tat- <dig> is expressed in the same tissues as tat- <dig>  tat- <dig> expression occurs in almost completely different tissues than those expressing either tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> or tat- <dig> alone . furthermore, tat-4; tat- <dig> double mutants are just as viable as tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> single mutants and wild-type animals. these observations indicate that although closely related , tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> are not redundant. although the less closely related tat- <dig>  and tat- <dig> are expressed in the same tissues, deletion of either one confers hypersensitivity to sterol deprivation to the same extent, which suggests that the two at most only partly redundant. tat- <dig> is the only gene of the three expressed in the excretory system. curiously, while tat- <dig> expression occurs in all vpc progeny during vulval development and then continues on in the adult vulva, tat- <dig> expression takes place specifically in the vule and vulf cells during vulval development only. this suggests that the two genes perform different roles in the development of the vulva. expression pattern of tat- <dig>  could not be obtained with our method of choice . however, the data presented by darland-ransom et al.  <cit>  indicate that this gene is expressed in the gonad and body-wall muscle cells – tissues in which tat- <dig> through  <dig> are not expressed. overall, the lack of gross growth and development impairment in tat- <dig> through  <dig> mutants does not seem to stem from a high level of redundancy among these genes.

while the individually dispensable s. cerevisiae subfamily iv p-type atpase genes  are essential as a group  <cit> , the individually dispensable c. elegans subfamily iv p-type atpase genes may also be dispensable as a group. tat- <dig> seems to be the only dispensable subfamily iv p-type atpase expressed in the body-wall muscle cells  <cit> . tat- <dig> null animals lose a few extra muscle cells, but this does not translate into a notable growth defect  <cit> . this suggests that together the four class  <dig> and  <dig> subfamily iv p-type atpases are nonessential for routine growth and development of c. elegans cells.

investigations in s. cerevisiae suggest that individually dispensable subfamily iv p-type atpases are redundant, especially with respect to internalization of ps and pe  <cit> . however, this does not seem to be the case for individually dispensable c. elegans subfamily iv p-type atpases. considering that c. elegans germline and somatic cells normally conceal ps  <cit>  and that loss of tat- <dig> leads to ps appearance on the surface of germline and certain somatic cells  <cit> , the contradiction between the yeast and the nematode paradigms does not imply that subfamily iv p-type atpases of the latter organism do not translocate aminophospholipids. rather, considering that class  <dig> subfamily iv members may execute the same biochemical functions as subfamily iv members in other classes  <cit>  and that loss of asymmetric ps and pe distribution across the plasma membrane is incompatible with survival  <cit> , our findings suggest that, in the nematode, tat- <dig> carries out the bulk of aminophospholipids internalization, while tat- <dig> through  <dig> adjust cross-bilayer lipid distribution in particular tissues.

c. elegans subfamily iv p-type atpases fine-tune sterol metabolism
c. elegans is a sterol heterotroph that employs a steroid-mediated developmental program. the nematode takes up exogenous sterols in the intestine and then converts them to 7-dehydrocholesterol  <cit> . the latter metabolite is used for synthesis of the reproductive development-promoting hormone, dafachronic acids, in the hypodermis  <cit> . in unfavorable growth conditions, production of the hormone stops and nematode larvae embark on the dauer  developmental pathway. complete sterol deprivation mimics cessation of the hormone synthesis in an otherwise favorable growth environment  <cit> . at sterol supplies below optimal, nematode development and reproduction are proportional to sterol concentration in the medium  <cit> . as a result, c. elegans reproductive growth is a sensitive indicator of the sterol level in the hypodermis after this lipid was taken up in the intestine and then traveled through the animal body.

our data show that tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> are required for growth during sterol starvation and that deletion of tat- <dig> exacerbates sterol hypersensitivity of tat- <dig> mutants. from the late stages of embryonic development through the rest of the nematode life cycle, tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> are strongly expressed in the intestine and other cells of the alimentary system; it is likely that the protein products of these genes fine-tune some aspects of sterol processing in these sterol-metabolizing tissues. tat- <dig> is a homolog of the mammalian atp8b1/atp8b <dig>  which encodes subfamily iv p-type atpase that localizes to the apical membrane of hepatocytes, enterocytes and other polarized cells of the mammalian digestive system  <cit> . future investigations should determine whether tat- <dig> also localizes to the apical membrane and whether tat- <dig> resides in the same membrane as tat- <dig>  tat- <dig> is expressed in the hypodermis and the xxx cells, both steroidogenic tissues where 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to dafachromic acids  <cit> . thus, it is likely that the product of this gene mediates, at least partly, turnover of 7-dehydrocholesterol after the release of this metabolite from the intestine. future research should test this hypothesis, as well as determine the membrane compartment in which tat- <dig> resides. overall, the lack of a notable phenotype in tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> through  <dig> null mutants during growth under normal conditions and the inability of tat- <dig> and tat- <dig> mutants to grow under sterol limiting conditions indicate that one critical function of the dispensable subfamily iv p-type atpases may be to fine tune metabolism of sterol and, perhaps, other lipids.

recent reports indicate that the yeast drs <dig> is also involved in sterol  metabolism  <cit> . drs2Δ mutants exhibit reduced ability to uptake exogenous sterol. atp8b1/atp8b <dig> mediates sterol  metabolism in mammals  <cit> . mutants of atp8b <dig> secrete more cholesterol with bile  <cit> . and homozygous individuals with compromised atp8b <dig> exhibit reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein -cholesterol and greatly increased levels of oxidized cholesterol  <cit> . together with these previous findings in yeast and mammals, involvement of tat- <dig> through  <dig> in sterol metabolism in c. elegans suggests that the role performed by the subfamily iv p-type atpases in this process may be conserved among eukaryotes and far greater than currently recognized.

CONCLUSIONS
the presented study shows that individually dispensable c. elegans putative aminophospholipid translocase genes exhibit a high degree of specialization. this finding contradicts the expectation derived from investigations in yeast that these genes should be broadly redundant and answers the question of why there are so many genes of this kind per organism. our study also partly answers the question of individual roles performed by putative aminophospholipid translocases by uncovering widespread involvement of members of this group in sterol metabolism.
