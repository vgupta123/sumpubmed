BACKGROUND
sudden changes in temperature can induce adaptive shock responses in bacteria, enabling them to colonize widely diverse environments. these adaptive responses involve major changes in the physiological state of the bacterial cells  <cit>  allowing them to survive and function in the new environment. smaller or slower changes in temperature may not induce shock responses but can modulate expression of particular physiological systems such as transport of nutrients, stress responses and virulence efficacy in pathogens. the latter type of change has been studied in animal pathogens that switch expression of colonization and invasion functions when changing hosts  <cit> . works addressing temperature-dependent virulence factors in animal pathogens and their regulation have been published only recently  <cit> .

virulence gene expression in most bacteria is modulated by diverse parameters, including ph, ion concentration, growth phase, population density and contact with the host. temperature may activate or deactivate virulence genes  <cit> , although the mechanisms involved are little known.

unlike many animal pathogens, plant pathogenic bacteria typically only undergo gradual temperature changes related to seasonal change in environment and are not subjected to sudden changes in temperatures when switching hosts. while most plant pathogens of a given species are active within a limited range of temperature, some strains are virulent across a wider range due to adaptive and perhaps evolutionary pressures. the risk of introducing such strains to new crop zones could be economically devastating. these pathogenicity differences may involve changes in protein regulation or may be due to the presence of unique genes involved in enabling virulence at low temperatures. this is the case of the bacterial wilt pathogen ralstonia solanacearum.

bacterial wilt is a soil-borne bacterial plant disease which affects more than  <dig> plant species including solanaceous crops such as tomato and potato  <cit> . r. solanacearum, its causal agent, is a species complex with strains classified into five races based on their host range  <cit> , and into  <dig> biovars based on biochemical profiles  <cit> . strains are further classified into phylotypes and sequevars based on phylogenetic relationships of the internal transcribed spacer region of the 16 s rrna gene sequence and endoglucanase  gene respectively  <cit> .

a subgroup of r. solanacearum, r3b <dig> phylotype iib, includes cold tolerant strains which are able to infect potato at low temperatures  <cit> . this subgroup originated in the highlands of the andes mountains and is adapted to cooler temperatures than typical strains of r. solanacearum <cit> . r3b <dig> strains are designated as “select agent” under the agriculture bioterrorism protection act of  <dig>  <cit>  due to their threat to food security in the u.s. early reports  <cit>  showed that strains belonging to the r3b <dig> group could infect potatoes at temperatures as low as 16°c. recent research has suggested that other races of r. solanacearum may also have the ability to survive freezing temperatures and thus have the potential to establish in temperate climates  <cit> .

r3b <dig> are not unique in their ability to infect host plants at low temperatures. we recently reported that r1b1-sequevar  <dig> strains are also capable of wilting tomato and potato plants at 18°c when soil inoculated  <cit> . moreover populations of r1b <dig> strains are indigenous in tropical and subtropical climates, such as in florida in contrast to r3b <dig> strains. a key difference, however, is that while r1b <dig> sequevar  <dig> can survive and multiply as well as r3b <dig> at cool temperatures, they are not as virulent on potato 18°c , although are similarly virulent on tomato. identifying the factors involved in r. solanacearum virulence at low temperatures may provide tools for effective control of the pathogen at low temperatures.

transcriptome and proteome analysis have been used to identify mrna and proteins, respectively, present in specific tissues, under diverse conditions. both methods give a snapshot of the state of the cell at a given time. because proteins are the key functional molecules, a characterization of the proteome is considered to represent the biological state of a cell more accurately than the mrna. current proteomic techniques involve the use of 2d dige which can differentiate thousands of proteins by molecular weight and isoelectric point  <cit> . the use of fluorescent dyes and independent protein controls in 2d dige have improved the throughput of 2d gels by allowing multiple proteins to be compared simultaneously. this technique has significantly improved gel-based proteomics analysis, although overall it requires a high quantity  of protein per sample.

in this study we used 2d dige gel and ms/ms techniques to compare the protein profiles at 30°c and 18°c of two strains of r. solanacearum  that are virulent at low temperature with two strains  that are not virulent at low temperature  <cit> . we hypothesized that either the difference in regulation of virulence factors present in all the strains or differences due to novel ones present in virulent strains at cool temperatures must explain the difference in virulence at low temperatures. the protein samples were obtained during the colonization phase of the infection from cultures incubated in the rhizosphere of tomato seedlings maintained at 30°c and 18°c. a total of  <dig> cell-associated and secreted proteins differentially expressed in one or more strains were identified, annotated and discussed.

RESULTS
comparative protein profiles of ralstonia solanacearum strains at 30°c and 18°c
comparison at 30°c and 18°c of cell-associated proteins from strain p <dig> incubated in rich media in absence of tomato plants identified  <dig> protein spots differentially expressed in a preliminary experiment. fifteen  differentially expressed spots with abundant volume were selected for sequencing, and  <dig> proteins were identified . the list includes several proteins related to metabolism and transport, a porin part of the type iv twitching motility apparatus , and a catalase , which have been previously related to virulence of ralstonia solanacearum.

cell-associated comparative protein profiles at two temperatures obtained from bacterial cultures of strains gmi <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and uw <dig> incubated in contact with tomato seedlings rhizosphere revealed  <dig> differentially expressed protein spots, determined by statistically differential intensities for each strains at two temperatures. further, secreted comparative protein profiles extracted from cultures of strains gmi <dig> and uw <dig> in contact with tomato seedlings rhizosphere identified  <dig> spots differentially expressed. overall, a total of  <dig> differentially expressed protein spots for all the rhizosphere colonization experiments were identified. out of the  <dig> spots,  <dig> were selected for protein sequencing. the selection criteria are described in detail in methods.

a total of  <dig> unique proteins were identified . detailed information about the proteins identified, including number of peptides, protein coverage, statistical confidence, size and isoelectric point is presented by strain in additional file  <dig> 

the distribution of the identified proteins by regulation shows that   <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins were expressed differentially in individual strains. for example,  <dig> proteins were differentially produced at 30°c compared with 18°c only in uw <dig>  the selection of the spots was focused on proteins that are down-regulated at 18°c in strains not virulent at low temperature  and/or up-regulated in strains virulent at low temperatures . in p <dig> and gmi1000 ≥ 67% of the differentially expressed proteins are more abundant at 30°c. in contrast, 85% of the proteins are more abundant at 18°c in the strains p <dig> and uw <dig> 

functional distribution
identified proteins were annotated, classified, and listed by broad biological categories using the amigo annotation database  <cit>  . the unknown proteins represent 23% of the identified proteins, and the most abundant . this group includes proteins with only predicted domains that indicate general enzymatic functions, or inferred protein structure, such as transmembrane proteins; however, no specific biological process functions were assigned. overall, 41% of the identified proteins belong to the metabolism and cell processes categories . the abundance of metabolism related proteins indicates temperature dependent responses in addition to common responses to limited nutritional compounds and exposure to an oxidizing environment from plant exudates  <cit> . in this category, amino acid, energy production, and macromolecules subcategories are the most numerous. the stress responses category includes proteins with detoxification functions such as catalases, peroxidases, drug or multicopper efflux pumps, chaperones involved in protein production and folding, and putative phasins involved in utilization of polymer reserve granules. transport category includes movement of inorganic molecules, such as phosphate, transport of amino acids, and sugar derivatives, probably linked to acquisition of nutrients in stressful environments. the smaller categories in terms of numbers although containing important proteins for virulence, were motility, secretion, and virulence.

the classification of proteins by comparative abundance profile at 30°c and 18°c  helped to identify patterns of regulation. of interest in the search for candidate virulence factors at low temperature are groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which combine proteins more abundant at 30°c in strains not virulent at low temperatures and/or more abundant at 18°c in strains virulent at low temperatures.

criteria used to group proteins by their temperature regulation based on the virulence of strains at low temperature.

we selected a core of  <dig> proteins that belong to groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and/or have been related to virulence in previous works . these proteins are strong candidates as factors that may affect virulence of r. solanacearum at low temperatures directly or indirectly.

mrna relative expression of  <dig> candidate cool virulence factors and global regulators hrpg and hrpb correlate with protein expression profiles
in order to confirm the proteomics results, the relative expression of  <dig> genes at  <dig> and 18°c was quantified by real-time reverse transcription qrt_pcr analysis. the relative expression of each gene to a reference gene  at each temperature was calculated, and presented as the ratio at 30°c versus 18°c . expression of  <dig> candidate genes tested was up-regulated at the higher temperature for strain p <dig>  the only gene that was down-regulated at 30°c was phap <dig> while the expected result was up-regulation. in p <dig>  results were variable; however, ratios were low compared with the ratios in the not virulent strains gmi <dig> and p <dig>  and most of the genes tested were down-regulated. in uw <dig> all genes tested were down-regulated at 30°c. the profile in figure  <dig> correlates with the expected pattern of expression inferred from the proteomics data for the target genes tested: in p <dig> and gmi <dig> genes are up-regulated at 30°c and in p <dig> and uw <dig> genes maintain similar expression at both temperatures or are up-regulated at 18°c, respectively.

relative expression of the hrpg and hrpb global virulence regulators was also tested with qrt_pcr . the relative expression at 30°c in p <dig> and gmi <dig> is up-regulated, while in p <dig> and uw <dig> it is down-regulated, suggesting a correlation between expression of regulators hrpg and hrpb and virulence at low temperature.

functional annotation and comparative temperature profile
in this section proteins differentially expressed and their profiles are described by biological process category.

metabolism/cell processes
cell processes class included proteins related to translation, transcription, and chaperoning . most of the proteins in this category belong to groups  <dig> and  <dig> . their profile of regulation suggests a more active cell state at 30°c for the strains not virulent at low temperature, and at 18°c for the virulent ones.

in the metabolism category approximately one third of the proteins were related to amino acid biosynthesis. the leucine-isoleucine biosynthetic pathway in particular, was represented by  <dig> different proteins  whose profile of expression belong to groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . leuc is the large unit of the isopropylmalate isomerase, a key enzyme in the l-leucine biosynthesis from valine. the pattern of expression of leuc was confirmed by qrt_pcr . enzymes that belong to cysteine and glutamate were also more abundant at 30°c in p <dig> 

energy production is another important subcategory in metabolism. proteins acee, glta, nuof, and mqo, related to the tca cycle have a variable pattern of abundance ratio; however proteins gapa, mdh, and acea related to glycolysis belong to groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

metabolism of macromolecules subcategory represented 9% of the differentially expressed proteins, their abundance profile was variable, and no correlation was observed with virulence at low temperature.

stress response
stress response proteins represented 14% of the differentially expressed proteins . proteins in this category relate to biosynthesis of carbon and energy reserves, protein folding in stressful environments, and proteins involved in detoxification. two proteins phap <dig>  phap <dig> which contain a phasin domain were differentially expressed. phasin domains are associated with synthesis or degradation of poly β-hydroxybutyrate  granules, formed as an alternate carbon reserve for organisms facing starvation in harsh environmental conditions  <cit> . in rhodospirillium rubrum phap protein is an activator of the phb degradation pathway  <cit> . in particular, phap <dig> was differentially expressed in all the strains and its abundance profile  correlated with virulence at low temperature. the rt-pcr confirmed the pattern of expression of all strains except for p <dig> where the gene was down-regulated , although with a small ratio.

groel/groes, form a complex that functions as chaperone in folding and refolding of proteins, usually induced under adverse environmental conditions  <cit> . heat-shock protein htpg and protease clpb were shown to facilitate de novo folding of proteins during high temperature conditions in e. coli <cit> . although the temperature changes in r. solanacearum are not sudden, these proteins may aid in stabilizing proteins during low temperature conditions .

differentially expressed detoxification proteins whose expression correlate with virulence at low temperature  included ppo, katg, dps , rsc <dig>  and rsp <dig> . ppo is a polyphenol oxidase which has been shown to have strong tyrosinase activity suggesting a possible role in counteracting phenolic compounds produced by the host plants  <cit> . dps contributes to oxidative stress tolerance and virulence on tomato plants  <cit> . katg and rsc <dig> are predicted peroxidases  <cit> , while rsp <dig>  has laccase activity, similar in function to the tyrosinase ppo  <cit>  and it was up-regulated by hydrogen peroxide in culture and in planta <cit> .

catalase kate was more abundant at 30°c in gmi <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> . kate was also up-regulated at 30°c when strain p <dig> was grown in rich media . a homolog of kate in agrobacterium tumefaciens  has been shown to contribute to its survival in adverse environmental conditions as in the presence of hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . in r. solanacearum, kate probably contributes to survival in the presence of phenolic compounds produced by the plant hosts. the response to the oxidative environment is temperature dependent; however, it does not correlate with virulence of the strains at low temperature.

conversely, ahpc <dig> predicted peroxidase was more abundant at 18°c in gmi <dig>  p <dig> and uw <dig> . the ratios of abundance in these comparisons were smaller than for the case of kate.

transport
the pattern of expression of  <dig> proteins related to transport of inorganic compounds were up-regulated in all the strains compared at 30°c .those proteins included putative alkaline phosphatases and several abc-type transporters . their pattern of regulation suggests more ion activity at 30°c irrespective the virulence of the strain at low temperatures. four proteins related to carbohydrate transport and two related to aminoacid transport were differentially expressed. their pattern of regulation varied, and there was no obvious co-relation with virulence at low temperatures.

motility/secretion
in the subcategory motility only pilq was identified as differentially expressed . pilq is a porin, integral part of the structural apparatus responsible for the twitching movement of r. solanacearum <cit> . twitching motility has been associated with attachment and virulence of r. solanacearum on their host  <cit> , and its expression is dependent on the quorum sensing regulatory pathway through pehs/pehr two components system  <cit> . pilq was up-regulated at 30°c in p <dig>  in rich media and in co-culture with tomato rhizosphere. in the rt_pcr experiment pilq was up-regulated at 30°c in gmi <dig> and p <dig>  and up-regulated or unchanged at 18°c in uw <dig> and p <dig> . this profile of expression correlates with virulence at low temperatures. twitching motility was also temperature dependent, independent of the presence of plants in previous studies  <cit> .

rsp <dig> and hcp  were identified as part of a recently described type vi secretion system  <cit> . their regulation profile correlates with virulence at low temperature  . rsp <dig> is a homolog to a type vi secretion apparatus protein known as vipb, or vca <dig> in vibrio cholerae , which is thought to be part of the core secretion apparatus  <cit> . rsp <dig> is a homolog to hcp of several gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . this is a protein secreted by the putative type vi secretion system  <cit>  and thought to be a translocator  <cit> .

type vi secretion systems have only recently been described in animal and plant pathogens  <cit> . this system is linked to virulence in vibrio cholerae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. since then the type vi secretion system has also been identified in silico in many gram negative bacterial genomes including r. solanacearum <cit> . similarly to other secretion systems it is also widespread among gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . interestingly, a cluster called imp with homology to the later described type vi secretion was shown to have a role in temperature-dependent protein secretion in r. leguminosarum <cit> , congruent with our results. the presence and pattern of abundance of these proteins, plus the involvement in virulence of type vi secretion systems in other bacterial pathogens, make the identified type vi secretion a strong candidate to virulence factor at low temperatures in r. solanacearum.

unknowns
among the twenty three unknown proteins that were differentially expressed, a cell-associated hypothetical rsp <dig>  was considered of interest because is a homolog of raxst, a component of a type i secretion cassette avrxa <dig> in xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae <cit> . in this latter organism the cassette contains four genes: raxa, raxb, raxc and raxst, which encode a sulfotransferase-like protein and are necessary for recognition of xa <dig>  a receptor-like kinase in rice. this putative pathogen-associated molecular pattern  effector could be involved in virulence in r. solanacearum. rsp <dig> was down-regulated at 18°c in gmi <dig> 

another protein of interest is rsc <dig> . this is a hypothetical protein with an emrb/qaca family multidrug resistance domain. this subfamily of drug efflux proteins are related to drug/antibiotic resistance transporters. transporters members of this subfamily include multidrug resistance locus in escherichia coli and vibrio cholerae <cit> .

although the experimental design favored identification of proteins that are present in all the strains, two differentially expressed proteins absent in gmi <dig> were identified: rrsl_ <dig> and rspo_m <dig> . the first has a methyltransferase domain and is present in uw <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  it was up-regulated at 30°c in p <dig>  the second is annotated as a hypothetical protein and is present in p <dig>  p <dig>  and in sequenced r. solanacearum strain po <dig>  <cit> . it was up-regulated at 18°c in p <dig> 

virulence
secreted virulence factors identified included a putative cellobiohydrolase encoded by the chba gene, an endoglucanase  and a putative chitinase  . their function is related to attack and degradation of the host’s cellular walls. it has been suggested that chba attacks the hemicellulose fraction of plant cell walls  <cit> ; however, in vitro enzyme activity on regular exoglucanase substrates such as methyl-umbelliferyl-cellobioside  has never been demonstrated  <cit> . liu et al. <cit>  demonstrated that a gmi <dig> strain defective in chba production is less virulent when soil inoculated. in the same way, an egl mutant impaired in endoglucanase activity is also less virulent  <cit> . their data suggest that chba and egl contribute equally to virulence in an additive fashion  <cit> . it was expected that chba and egl would be co-regulated. the proteomics and rt_pcr results do not support this assumption. in our results, chba was more abundant at 30°c in gmi <dig>  and egl was more abundant at 30°c in uw <dig> ; however, chba was more abundant at 18°c in uw <dig> in the rt_pcr results .

the cell-associated proteins hrcc and wesc were more abundant at 18°c in uw <dig> , supporting a role in virulence at low temperature. hrcc is an integral part of the type iii secretion apparatus which is a determinant virulence factor in r. solanacearum <cit> , and wesc  is part of the exopolysaccharide operon, involved in aggressiveness during host colonization  <cit> .

discussion
in previous work we determined that there is a barrier to virulence at low temperature at the stage of colonization of the host rhizosphere  <cit> . therefore in this study we focused our comparative analysis on that stage of the disease. we designed an in vitro system that mimics the natural rhizosphere conditions and at the same time facilitate the retrieval of r. solanacearum proteins from a sterile environment. bacteria in co-culture with tomato seedlings exploit plant exudates in order to multiply and approach roots as in the natural rhizosphere  <cit> . we used 2d-dige gels to identify proteins that were differentially expressed in  <dig> strains of r. solanacearum that are either virulent or not virulent at low temperatures. our experiments provided information about the identity of proteins expressed differentially and their pattern of regulation at two temperatures. following we discuss the biological significance of our data.

overall, the abundance of proteins related to cell processes and metabolism at low temperature suggests that the metabolic state of virulent strains is not reduced at low temperature as it is for not virulent strains. for example, the leucine-isoleucine biosynthetic pathway could be important for survival, growth, or competition of r. solanacearum in the rhizosphere environment, and strain uw <dig> which increases its expression at 18°c may have a competitive advantage for growth and colonization of the roots at low temperature over the other strains. the glycolysis process may also contribute to fitness of virulent strains at low temperature in the rhizosphere.

the presence of stress response proteins was expected because r. solanacearum encounters an oxidative environment in the rhizosphere of the host plant  <cit> ; however, these proteins were also temperature dependent and the strains responded differently to this environment at low temperatures. the different behaviors between kate, ahpc <dig>  and other predicted peroxidases suggest that the different catalases/peroxidases may have specific functions and may be activated/de-activated by different regulators. the higher volumes of heat-shock protein htpg and protease clpb in strains that are virulent at low temperatures, suggest a higher level of cellular protection at low temperatures in virulent strains.

the presence of an hcp homolog in our results among the secreted proteins indicated a functional type vi secretion system. secretion of hcp is used to identify functional type vi secretion systems in bacterial species  <cit>  since presence of hcp in the secretome of bacterial species is required for the function of this secretion system  <cit> . an important observation is that the regulation of this system is temperature dependent similar to the imp cluster in rhizobium leguminosarum <cit> . the pattern of expression of the type vi related proteins suggests that this system may play a role in virulence at low temperature.

the difference in pattern of regulation of the virulence proteins identified suggests different regulation pathways. this was partially determined for chba, egl, eps and tek  <cit> . egl and tek are directly regulated by the global regulator phca  <cit> , while chba, and eps are regulated indirectly through a vsra/vsrd two component system  <cit> .

global virulence regulators hrpg and hrpb expression was found to be temperature dependent and correlated with virulence at low temperature . our results support the hypothesis that virulence at low temperatures is explained primarily by differences in temperature dependent regulation of proteins present in all the strains. r. solanacearum has a complicated regulation network that it is still largely unknown. there may yet be regulation subsystems that control specific virulence and survival factors at low temperatures. the future direction is to investigate the known global virulence regulators and perhaps identify new ones.

proteomics is a powerful method to give a picture of the state of an organism and discover proteins that may contribute to specific functions; however the presence of very abundant proteins obscured the identification of proteins produced in smaller quantities. for example, we noted the absence of type iii effectors in our results. we identified a putative porin hrcc associated with the type iii apparatus, which suggest that type iii effectors cannot be discarded as potential temperature dependent proteins. an indication that the type iii secretion may be temperature dependent was the profile of the type iii global regulator hrpb in our qrt_pcr expression experiment.

we sequenced 40% of the differentially expressed spots, reducing our capacity to identify all the protein spots that were differentially expressed in the comparisons. we hypothesized that a protein important for virulence should be expressed in less quantity at low temperature for not virulent strains, and in more quantity for virulent ones at low temperatures; therefore most protein spots that fit the criteria were selected for sequencing. we combined experiments to obtain a more complete picture with very good results. very few of the proteins were contradictory across experiments and the rest were independent or congruent, providing us with an extra quality control step.

CONCLUSIONS
the comparative protein analysis presented in this work identified likely candidates for temperature dependent virulence factors. to our knowledge, this is the first report of temperature dependent protein expression in a plant pathogen. this also is the first report of an inferred functional system in ralstonia solanacearum. this secretion system was previously identified by bioinformatic methods but not previously confirmed. our results support the hypothesis that virulence at low temperature is mainly due to regulation differences between strains that are virulent and strains that are not virulent at low temperatures. this work provides a list of candidate virulence factors at low temperatures whose expression is temperature dependent and a working hypothesis for the study of the virulence mechanism at low temperatures.
