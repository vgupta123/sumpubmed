BACKGROUND
pl <dig> was first identified in mouse by using a human y chromosome  derived probe  <cit>  and is present in a wide range of eukaryotes from yeast, plants, and animals, including humans  <cit> . in the mouse, pl <dig> has been shown to encode a functional protein with an important dead motif , which plays essential roles in spermatogenesis  <cit> . in eutherian mammals, pl <dig> has two closely-related paralogs, ddx3x  and ddx3y , located on the sex chrs. pl <dig>  ddx3x and ddx3y share the dead motif and constitute the ddx3/ded <dig>  subfamily under the dead-box helicase family  <cit>  with a major function related to rna metabolism  <cit> . the ddx3/ded <dig> subfamily is involved in diverse cellular process including tissue differentiation at distinct developmental stages, embryogenesis, asexual reproduction, cell regeneration, tumorigenesis and immune response  <cit> , which have been reviewed comprehensively by rosner et al.  <cit> .

interestingly, the biological roles of the eutherian members in ddx <dig> subfamily appear to be varied and lineage-dependent although they share domain structures and highly similar sequences. in eutheria, the ddx3x has been shown to elicit immunoresponse because the ddx3x can interact with tank-binding kinase  <dig>  to induce the type i interferon  promoter and the downstream immune pathway  <cit> . in addition, ddx3x also plays a role in hiv infection and becomes an important target in antiviral therapy  <cit> . on the other hand, the human ddx3y lies within the azoospermia factor a  region on the proximal yq <dig>  and the deletion of human ddx3y resulted in the oligozoospermia, azoospermia and the male sertoli-cell only syndrome  <cit> . in spite of their high amino acid  similarity , ddx3x cannot rescue the loss-of-function of ddx3y in human  <cit> , signifying the functional diversification between ddx3x and ddx3y. the human ddx3y is believed to be one of the essential genes involved in human spermatogenesis and male fertility  <cit> . in contrast to the human ortholog, the pivotal role of ddx3y in spermatogenesis has been replaced by the autosomal pl <dig> in mice  <cit> . the mouse pl <dig> is believed to evolve from ddx3x through the retroposition mechanism  <cit> . more interestingly, the bovine pl <dig> has also been proved to be active at the transcription level even though it may lose protein-coding potential  <cit> . in addition to the lineage-dependent functionality of pl <dig>  the tissue specificity of ddx3x/ddx3y homologs has also been shown to vary in mouse and human  <cit> . the lineage-specific expression patterns and the diverse genomic structures and locations of pl <dig> homologs suggest that the pl <dig> homologs regulate biological process via divergent mechanisms and evolved differently. however, previous studies focused mainly on elucidating the function rather than the evolution of pl <dig>  which elicited our interest to investigate the evolutionary history behind pl <dig>  ddx3x, and ddx3y. here, we report the results from a phylogenetic analysis of the pl <dig> homologs in  <dig> different species.

RESULTS
the identification of pl <dig> homologous sequences
to obtain deep insight into pl <dig> evolution, we collected the pl <dig> related genes deposited in ncbi  <cit>  and detected its potential homologs by comparing the mouse pl <dig> mrna sequence against the ucsc genome database  <cit> . in addition to the  <dig> annotated sequences for pl <dig>  ddx3x and ddx3y, we identified  <dig> pl <dig> putative homologous regions  in the genomes of mammals . these putative homologs occupied the genomes with two major patterns in terms of their spanning size . the large-size homologs are located in the sex chrs containing intron-exon structures, while the small-size ones are mostly autosomal and intronless .

* the corresponding protein entry is np_ <dig> .

Δ the position was annotated based on nw_ <dig> .

we extracted the sequences from these putative homologous regions and conducted a gene prediction using genscan  <cit>  to identify whether these homologous sequences maintain protein-coding potential. based on gene similarity, structures and chromosomal locations, we obtained the predicted ddx3x in chimp and orangutan, and pl <dig> on chr  <dig> in rat . the predicted chimp and orangutan ddx3x matched the predicted coding proteins in ensembl  <cit>  . compared to the human ddx3x protein of  <dig> aa, the predicted peptide is much shorter in the chimp with only  <dig> aa because of the incomplete sequence. the predicted rat pl <dig> matched to the entry, np_ <dig> , in the ncbi database, and we concluded that it is the rat pl <dig> based on its intronless structure and high sequence similarity  with the mouse pl <dig>  in opossum, the predicted ddx <dig> peptide matched to ensmodt <dig> in ensembl  <cit>  . the remaining  <dig> homologs either do not have an open reading frame  or have a premature stop codon . thus, they are pseudogenes.

* the alignment coverage was calculated based on the pairwise alignment between the mouse pl <dig> and identified homologous regions.

Δ ns: the homologous region contains incomplete sequences. ins: the homologous region is interrupted by non-homologous sequences. gap: part of mpl <dig> was not alignable with the detected homologous sequences.

the analyses of pl <dig> phylogeny
using the  <dig> pl <dig> related entries from ncbi together with  <dig> previously-described putatively homologous sequences, we constructed a phylogenetic tree to investigate the evolutionary relationship among these homologs. the tree clearly indicated several evolutionary clusters . the first cluster is the pl10/ddx3x cluster, within which the putative homologous sequences on primate chr <dig> were in the same clade and clustered with the primate ddx3x. the autosomal homologous regions in ruminants and carnivores, including the bovine pl <dig> pseudogene  <cit> , were also in the same cluster and grouped with the ddx3x counterparts as in primates . no apparent insertions were detected in these homologous regions. the mouse and rat pl <dig> were in the same branch. however, an additional putative homolog of ddx3x was detected in mouse  and rat , which was grouped with its corresponding ddx3x gene, respectively, before clustering them together into a single group. it is noteworthy that all homologs of ddx3x identified in mammals are intronless . since the mammalian ddx3x contains an intron-exon structure, we reasoned that these intronless homologs are most likely the evolutionary trace after the ddx3x retroposition.

in addition to the functional eutherian ddx3x, we detected another putative homologous region on primate chrx which was present on the same branch with the ddx3y instead of the ddx3x . in contrast to the autosomal homologs, these chrx putative homologs contain one or more insertions that appear to fit with the typical gt/ag splicing rule , raising the possibility that these additional x homologs may have derived from a transposition event before the primate divergence . furthermore, in opossum and chicken, only a single homologous region with the intron-exon structure was detected on opossum chr <dig>  and chicken chr <dig> , respectively .

positive selection test for the pl <dig> related genes
we compared the one-ratio model with the free-ratio model to test the lineage-specific positive selection for the pl <dig> related functional homologs in our dataset using paml <dig> package  <cit> . the one-ratio model assumes the same ka/ks  ratio for all the lineages. the log-likelihood value under this model was l <dig> = - <dig>  with  <dig> parameters where the transition/transversion rate ratio was k =  <dig>  and w =  <dig> . the w was computed as the average of all codon sites and lineages. the free-ratio model assumes an independent w ratio for each branch and the number of parameters was increased to  <dig> for our dataset in this model. the likelihood value under this model was l <dig> = - <dig> . the comparison of the likelihood value, 2Δl =  <dig>  was  <dig>  as determined by the x <dig> distribution with degree of freedom  of  <dig> , allowing us to reject the one-ratio model and conclude that the w ratios are varied among lineages . in mammals, the estimates of w ratios were all lower than  <dig>  on the branches leading to the lineages for pl <dig> and ddx3x, whereas the w ratios were higher on average  among the lineages for ddx3y . furthermore, the primate lineages for ddx3y in human and chimp were detected to be subject to positive selection . the branches leading to the mammalian pl <dig> homologs clade  also showed w ratios larger than  <dig>  suggesting that the evolution of pl10/ddx3x/ddx3y was under positive selection.

since some lineages were positively selected, especially in the case of ddx3y, we further used a small dataset containing only the mammalian homologous coding sequences to examine the positively selected sites. the test statistic of likelihood ratio test  between the one-ratio model  and the discrete model  was  <dig>  that is greater than the critical value  =  <dig>  when df =  <dig> . this suggested that the selective pressure is diverse among the codons. three site classes calculated under model m <dig> have prior probability of p <dig> =  <dig> , p <dig> =  <dig> , and p <dig> =  <dig>  with the ka/ks ratios of w <dig> =  <dig> , w <dig> =  <dig>  and w <dig> =  <dig>  . the posterior probabilities of site classes calculated in model m <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  however, the lrt of the other two pairs of models, m1a /m2a  and m <dig> /m <dig> , generated an incongruent result. the test statistic of the m1a/m2a is insignificant , whereas the m7/m <dig> generated a significant result with a lrt value of  <dig>  greater than the critical value at df =  <dig>   =  <dig>   , which together gave rise to the marginal prediction of the codon sites with relaxed selective constraints. four  and six  sites were inferred to contain increased w ratios under models m2a and m <dig>  respectively. four of the six inferred sites in model m <dig> coincided with the result of model m2a, including ala <dig>  leu <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  in which the ser <dig> and ser <dig> have posterior probability higher than  <dig>  under model m <dig> . all of the inferred sites are located in the non-domain regions.

conservation of pl <dig> homologs
we conducted a multiple alignment for all the analyzed sequences to investigate the domain conservation in pl <dig>  ddx3x and ddx3y, and found that the dead/deah box helicase domain  and helicase conserved c-terminal domain  of the ddx <dig> genes are highly conserved . we evaluated the degree of conservation by consurf   <cit> , which assigned the conservation score to each site of the provided ddx3x structures   <cit>  based on the empirical bayesian method  <cit> . after mapping the conservation score to the structure, we found that the highly conserved codons concentrated in the cleft where the adenosine monophosphate  and rna substrates interact with the ddx <dig> proteins .

discussion
in the non-eutherian lineages, pl <dig> is the sole member of the ddx <dig> subfamily, whereas in eutheria, the ancient pl <dig> gene is located on the ancestral sex chrs, resulting in the sex chr-linked orthologs, ddx3x and ddx3y . molecular evolutionary studies in recent years have established that the mammalian sex chrs originated from a pair of ordinary autosomes, and most ancestral genes on that pair were still maintained on the x chr but degenerated on the y chr due to the lack of recombination  <cit> . however, the y chr intends to maintain the functional genes that are beneficial to the male, such as those genes involved in spermatogenesis including ddx3y  <cit> . like the non-eutherian pl <dig>  ddx3x and ddx3y comprise the intron-exon structures, supporting the concept that ddx3y and ddx3x are the evolutionary relics of the ancestral autosomal pl <dig>  in opossum, the pl <dig> homologous sequence was detected only on mdo <dig> but not on the sex chrs. the opossum chr <dig> homolog also contains the intron-exon structure with predicted peptide close to ddx3x. similarly, the single homologous sequence detected in chicken was located on the autosomes and it contains introns. a recent study for the gene cluster in the x/y-added region of mammalian sex chrs, xar and yar, revealed that the gene cluster and the gene order of this region are the same on chicken gga <dig> but separated on opossum mdo <dig> and mdo <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a single translocation event gave rise to the different chromosomal locations of the gene cluster among chicken and opossum. the ddx3x/ddx3y also reside within the xar/yar, which allowed us to reach the parallel conclusion that the translocation generated the pl <dig> homologs on the chicken chr <dig> and opossum chr <dig>  and ddx3x/ddx3y on the eutherian sex chrs .

of particular interest is the occurrence of the mouse pl <dig>  an intronless gene and the only demonstrated functional autosomal ortholog in mammals to date. consistent with a previous deduction  <cit> , our result supported that the rodent pl <dig> was derived from the retroposition of the ddx3x genes  <cit> . retroposition is a crucial mechanism of gene duplication  <cit>  and generates many new genes in new genomic positions through the reverse transcription of a parental gene  <cit> . the parental gene usually contains introns, whereas the processed retrocopy is intronless  <cit> . thus, the other detected putative autosomal pl <dig> homologous sequences without apparent intron-exon structure in cattle, horse, dog and primates may have also evolved through the retroposition mechanism. these intronless homologous sequences on autosomes were consistently detected in eutherians but not in opossum, suggesting that the retroposition occurred after the divergence of eutherian and other mammals around  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this raised an interesting question, why does the autosomal retroposition of the pl <dig> occur specifically in eutheria? it may be partially explained by the important functional role of mouse pl <dig> and the recently discovered bovine pl <dig>  the mouse pl <dig> has been evidenced to be a central gene regulating the spermatogenesis and replace the role of ddx3y  <cit> . the bovine pl <dig>  albeit pseudogenized during the evolution, has also been proven to be active transcriptionally and may be involved in the regulatory coordination of bovine spermatogenesis  <cit> . although the coding potential of the autosomal pl <dig> homologous sequences in eutheria, except in mouse, is diminished, we cannot exclude the possibility that these homologous sequences may be involved in regulating some biological process at the transcriptional level. indeed, previous studies suggested that the pseudogenes may regulate the expression of the functional paralogous genes by producing antisense rna  <cit> . therefore, it is valuable to investigate whether these homologous sequences are transcriptable and their potential function in the future.

the maximum likelihood ratio test  for different lineages indicated that the ka/ks ratios in the pl <dig> homologs are varied among the evolutionary lineages. the ka/ks ratio along the branches among the mammalian lineages showed that the evolution of the mammalian pl <dig> homologs were not subject to positive selection, except for the human and chimp ddx3y that are positively selected . in addition to the chimp and human ddx3y, we found that the ratios for the other eutherian lineages for ddx3y appear to be higher when compared to those for mammalian pl <dig> and ddx3x, which is in line with a finding by wilson and makova  <cit> . these elevated w ratios can be explained by either the effect of relaxed selective constraints for the lineages containing ddx3y due to the absent recombination of the chry or a weak positive selection operating on the y-homologs  <cit> . the latter may still continue to refine the male-specific function for the y-homologs  <cit> . in contrast, the mammalian lineages for ddx3x and pl <dig> with extremely low w ratios suggested that purifying selection may act strongly on the mammalian pl <dig> and x-homologs. furthermore, the w ratios of the branches leading to the avian and mammalian lineages were larger than  <dig>  indicating that the emergence of eutherian pl <dig> homologs was selected positively to acquire species-specific gene function and purifying selection acted on the ddx3x and pl <dig> homologs to preserve their crucial biological function and avoid their divergence.

a ddx3x/ddx3y-specific multi-residue insertion  has been observed to form an important positively charged cavity with the neighboring positive residues to increase the rna binding surface in humans  <cit> . after incorporating pl <dig> and the homologous regions, we found that the insertion was highly conserved in the pl <dig> homologs of fish, frog, chicken, and other mammals, suggesting that the functional constraints occurred along the cavity region in the related homologs. conversely, this insertion was not well-conserved in plants and invertebrates. furthermore, the ddx3x displayed no activity with the rna substrate when different flanking regions surrounding the domains were removed  <cit> . a similar effect was proven in other dead-box helicase related genes, such as the uap <dig>  <cit>  and dp <dig>  <cit> , where the deletion of either the n-terminal or c-terminal flanking sequences outside the domain core regions impacts their helicase and atpase activity, signifying the regulatory roles of the flanking regions. as shown from the analysis of positively selected amino acids, all the marginally inferred selected sites were located in the non-domain regions  and may have served as the targets for improving the gene function during the evolution. one of the inferred sites, ser <dig>  occurred in the hinge region between two domains, suggesting its potential role in the adaption of the pl <dig> protein conformations and ligand-binding specificity. the slightly elevated w ratios were observed mostly in the non-domain regions as depicted in fig.  <dig>  indicating the purifying selection may attenuate in these regions to allow the functional accommodations of the pl <dig> homologs. moreover, several sites in the flanking regions of the human ddx3x have been shown to undergo epigenetic modifications, including ser <dig> <cit> , tyr <dig> <cit> , ser <dig> <cit> , ser <dig> <cit> , ser <dig> <cit> , tyr <dig> <cit> , ser <dig> <cit> , ser <dig> <cit> , ser <dig> <cit>  and ser <dig> <cit> . meanwhile, two sites in the flanking sequences of the human ddx3y, tyr <dig>  <cit>  and ser <dig>  <cit> , have been shown to be phosphorylated, and they are conserved with the modified sites at tyr <dig> and ser <dig> in the human ddx3x. the mouse pl <dig> also has two phosphorylated sites at tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  but both of them were located in the domains  <cit> . the sequence comparison showed that the selection force has limited the divergence in the regions flanking the domains of pl <dig> related genes in fish, frog, bird and mammals, and most of the epigenetically modified sites were highly conserved among these species. interestingly, despite the high degree of conservation, ser <dig> exists specifically in the pl <dig> and ddx3x homologs but not in the ddx3y orthologs. this distinction and different epigenetic modification pattern may partly contribute to the functional divergence between the eutherian ddx3y, ddx3x and pl <dig>  the functional specificity of pl <dig> homologs appear to be determined multifactorially, including the sequence elements located in the non-conserved regions, the factors controlling the diverse temporal and spatial expression patterns  <cit> , and the distinct epigenetic modification patterns  <cit> .

this study was limited to the availability of complete genomes and the accuracy of the genome assembly. even though the number of finished genome projects in diverse species is growing, incomplete sequences of pl <dig> homologs still exist in the published genomes, especially for the challenges in sequencing and assembly of the y chr due to its highly repetitive nature. further understanding of the evolution of sex chr linked genes largely relies on the clarification of the diverse genomes in species other than primates.

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses revealed that several conserved putative pl <dig> homologous regions, in addition to the functional pl10/ddx3x/ddx3y, are present on the autosome and mammalian x chr. these homologs share high similarity  and coverage  with mouse pl <dig> but contain premature stop codons or indels, resulting in shorter putative peptides and/or frameshifts, suggesting their pseudogenization during the course of evolution  <cit> . the eutherian ddx3x/ddx3y located in xar/yar were derived from the translocation of the orthologs on the ancestral autosome  <cit> . the identified putative autosomal homologs in mammals in the present study were retroposed from the ddx3x while the additional x-homologs in primates were transposed from the ddx3y. these translocation events are lineage-specific. like the bovine pl <dig>  these homologs may still be active transcriptionally. positive selection appears to operate on the pl <dig> homologs during the evolution. in addition to the highly conserved domain regions, several sites in the non-domain regions of functional pl <dig> homologs may play roles in enhancing the gene function in a lineage-specific manner.

the results reported in this study not only increase our knowledge regarding the molecular evolution of pl <dig> homologs, which will facilitate the future functional characterization of pl <dig> homologs, but also provide a valuable model to investigate the origin and evolution of the mammalian sex chrs and the mechanisms behind lineage-specific gene duplication and functionality.
