BACKGROUND
chloride ion plays an important role in controlling cell excitability. cl− flowing through gaba receptors is generally inhibitory, but in developing brain, high intracellular cl− concentration allows the efflux of cl− making it excitatory. likewise, the mammalian olfactory sensory neurons maintain an intracellular cl− concentration of ~69 mm  <cit>  or 40–50 mm  <cit> . odor stimulation activates the cyclic nucleotide-gated  channel and results in calcium influx activating calcium-activated chloride channels  to depolarize the neurons .

recent studies have revealed the involvement of a chloride conductance in vno activation. in vno neuron, urinary stimulus appears to activate cacc currents. the chloride conductance is carried by tmem16a/anoctamin <dig>  <cit>  and can be activated independently of the trpc <dig> channel, therefore constitutes a parallel signal transduction pathway . the level of intracellular cl− is critical in determining the direction of current flow. with high in, efflux of cl− would result in an inward current to depolarize the cells. conversely, at low in, the ions may not flow across the cell membrane or flow intracellularly leading to an outward current to hyperpolarize the cells. in slice and single cell recordings , activation of cacc currents appears to depolarize the vno neurons, suggesting that these cells maintain a high intracellular cl− concentration. however, the concentration of cl− in vno neurons has not been determined.

we sought to determine the intracellular cl− concentration of vno neurons in live slice preparations. in the olfactory neurons, intracellular ion concentrations were first determined by energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis in cryosections of the rat olfactory epithelium  <cit> . this method required highly specialized equipment that is not easily accessible. kaneko and colleagues measured intracellular cl− concentration in the olfactory neuron by using n--6-methoxy-quinolinium bromide  as a fluorescent chloride ion indicator  <cit> . in this study we adopt this method to measure intracellular cl− concentration in the mouse vno neurons.

RESULTS
intracellular cl− concentration in the vno neurons
mqae is used as a chloride fluorescent indicator to determine the intracellular cl− concentration because of its collisional quenching property. high cl− concentration quenches its fluorescent signal. it has been successfully used to monitor the intracellular cl− concentrations of olfactory neurons, the dorsal roots ganglion cells, salivary glands as well as brain slices  <cit> . we prepared vno slice at 100 μm thickness to preserve the intact neuronal structure including the dendrite. incubating vno slice with mqae for 30 min resulted in robust fluorescence in the vno neurons. after loading we measured the fluorescent signals in the vno neurons incubated in tyrode solution before and after urine application . fluorescent signals in vno slice noticeably increased during urine application, indicating a reduction of intracellular cl−. the elevation of fluorescent signals lasted the entire duration of urine application. this is consistent with previous observation that the vno neurons exhibit non-adaptive responses  <cit> . over the course of urine application there is no change in background fluorescence, indicating that the changes were not from signals of urine application . on average there was a 12 % increase in fluorescence . this observation is consistent with previous observation that urine induces efflux of cl− from vno neurons .fig.  <dig> urine induced change in mqae fluorescence in vno slices. a image of vno slice in tyrode solution  and in response to urine stimulation . scale bar is 25 μm. b quantitative measurement of fluorescence signal during urine application for the cell indicated by the arrows. square indicates vno slice image and circle for background change. c

to estimate the intracellular cl− in slice preparation, we measured the fluorescent signals in a series of standard cl− solutions. the neurons were permeabilized with ionophores and incubated with the standard solutions. cl− homeostasis is maintained by chloride co-transporters including na–k–cl co-transporter  <cit>  and k–cl co-transporter  <cit> . the homeostasis mechanism may skew the results when the standard solutions dramatically alter the intracellular salt balance. thus, in addition to chloride ionophore  <dig>  we used the cl−/oh− ionophore tributyltin to remove transmembrane h+/oh− gradients. we also include nigericin, an ionophore for h+ , k+ and cl−, to remove the contribution of cations in resetting cl− gradient. a previous study has shown that these ionophores dissipate cl− gradients across the plasma membrane  <cit> . by abolishing cl− gradient, the intracellular cl− concentration could be equilibrated with the extracellular cl−.

following measurements before and after urine application without ionophores, we measured mqae fluorescence by incubating the vno slices with standard solutions containing the ionophore cocktail. mqae fluorescent intensity was high at low  and the signal was quenched at high  . changing external  led to quick changes of intracellular fluorescent signals in the slices. we performed repeated imaging using  <dig> and 150 mm standard solutions over a period of 4 min. the fluorescent intensity at 15 mm  reached the same levels during three applications . there was no bleaching effect as observed in previous studies  <cit> . the difference may be explained by increased sensitivity of a new generation of confocal microscope, which required less laser power to excite the fluorophores.fig.  <dig> measurement of intracellular chloride concentration in vno neuron. a fluorescence signal of a vno slice loaded with mqae dye and incubated in ionophore cocktail in 15 mm  and 150 mm  standard solutions. scale bar is 10 μm. b repeated calibration using the two standard solutions indicates no obvious bleaching. fluorescent intensity  is plotted over time. top three bars indicate incubation with 15 mm solution and bottom two bars indicate incubation with 150 mm solution. acsf is used before and after the calibration. c stern–volmer equation fit  to fluorescent signals using standard intracellular chloride concentration . average intensities of mqae fluorescence of vno neurons at rest  and during urine application are extrapolated to obtain in. data is shown as mean ± s.e.m



we applied standard solutions containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 150 mm cl− and measured fluorescent intensities. all measurements from the same cell were normalized to the highest fluorescent intensity, measured with 15 mm standard chloride solution . the data were fit with the stern–volmer equation with linear regression. we used fluorescent signals measured at rest and during urine stimulation to extrapolate in using the standard curve. the intracellular cl− concentration was determined to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  in tyrode solution. urine-activation caused detectable increase in fluorescence, indicating a drop in intracellular cl− concentration resulting from the efflux of cl− ions . with the same method the intracellular cl− concentration in urine presence was calculated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, which was  <dig>  mm reduction from resting condition .

CONCLUSIONS
the vomeronasal organ is involved in detection of pheromone cues, which are contained in bodily fluids and excretions. pheromone-containing fluids, including urine, contain varying salt concentrations that may affect pheromone detection. the vomeronasal organ appears to have evolved specific mechanisms in mitigating the impact by the large variation of ionic concentrations. for example, the supporting cells have specialized ion conductance for k+ and cl−  <cit> . recent studies have shown that the vno utilizes different signal transduction pathways in parallel to mediate its activation  <cit> . existing evidence suggests that cacc is involved in vno signal transduction . the ion channels responsible for cl− conductance is likely to be anoctomin  <dig>  and anotamin  <dig> , which have been found to be located in the dendritic knob of the vno sensory neurons  <cit> . the latest study show that cacc is abolished in the vno of mice without tmem16a  <cit> . in this study, we determine in for vno neurons at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for wildtype and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for trpc2−/− mice. the values we obtain are remarkably similar to what is observed in the olfactory sensory neurons  <cit> . under conditions in which electrophysiology and imaging experiments are conducted , the reversal potential for cl− calculated from nernst equation is at −21 mv. because vno neurons rest at ~−50 mv, the activation of chloride channels would lead to an outward flow of cl−, causing depolarization of the neurons. consistent with the notion that the cacc can be activated independently from trpc <dig>  urine application elicited changes in fluorescent signals in trpc2−/− vno. it is noticeable that the resting in in trpc2−/− vno is slightly lower than the wildtype. moreover, urine induced change of in is slightly smaller in trpc2−/− than in wild type, although the difference is not statistically significant. this evidence provides further support of parallel pathways of vno activation. it also indicate that trpc <dig> may contribute to regulate basal levels of in and to influx of cl−. a reduction in ca2+ influx may reduce cacc activation.

we note that our measurements are from vno cell body with intact dendrite. although we observe concomitant change in fluorescent intensity in the dendrites as the cell bodies, technical challenges of imaging in slice have prevented us from accurately track individual dendritic structure. because intracellular changes are observed in both dendrites and cell bodies during pheromone stimulation, it is likely that calcium activated channels are present in both compartments. although tmem16a and tmem16b may be concentrated in the dendrite to mediate primary response, the expression of bestrophin  <dig> may allow cl− movement in the cell body  <cit> .
