BACKGROUND
the comprehensive analysis of gene microarray datasets, each containing thousands of genes, face statistical "catch 22" between type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  errors. in traditional "linear paradigm" research, type  <dig> errors can be devastating as they provide false conclusions upon which further work and conclusions may be based. therefore, investigators often adopt rigorous statistical criteria to reduce type  <dig> errors and like to see experiments repeated  before believing a conclusion.

conclusions based on analysis of microarray often serve only as the initial foundation for subsequent confirmation and more traditional avenues of research. as a result, investigators using expression arrays tend to be less concerned about the potential for a small number of false positives. however, a high number of false negatives may result from the failure to recognize the involvement of specific biological processes or molecular networks in the physiological system under study. as a result investigators using comprehensive expression arrays often find themselves in this "catch 22" situation. if they use traditional statistical methods, with conservative multiple test corrections, there is potential for a large number of type  <dig> errors. if they use "generous" statistical criteria to reduce type  <dig> errors, they generate a list of genes so large that it cannot be comprehensively analyzed in a meaningful way.

presently, we investigated the use of a novel data mining strategy. first, a microarray dataset was subjected to analysis using very stringent statistical criteria to define spleen leukocyte genes whose expression was different between the two strains of mice. second, this set of "core" differentially expressed genes, was then used as "bait" in a cluster analysis to pull out another set of "peripheral" genes whose expression patterns was very similar to that of the core genes, although these "peripheral" genes had not been identified by the initial statistical criteria. this was done by subjecting the whole set of expression array data to hierarchical clustering and then examining the resulting "gene tree" for sub-branches that contained a high percentage of core genes.

finally, we conducted network analyses on both lists of genes as a way to sort out genes that are not biologically connected to the other genes on the list and to define the molecular networks that were represented within each list of genes. this allowed us to compare the physiological processes represented by the two resulting networks.

RESULTS
we analyzed expression array data from  <dig> samples of spleen leukocytes with  <dig> samples from the nod and  <dig> samples from c57bl/ <dig> female mice. half of the samples from each strain were collected at two weeks of age and half at four weeks. first, we conducted a two-way anova on the  <dig>  probesets to determine genes with statistically significant  differences between strains and age groups. the stringent bonferroni multiple correction test was used to reduce the number of false positives. with the bonferroni correction, we performed one test for each probeset and then ranked the  <dig>  p-values. for  <dig> % confidence we divide  <dig>  by  <dig> to get  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  if any p = value is lower than  <dig>  × 10- <dig> it passes the bonferroni multiple correction test. thus, use of bonferroni for mitigating false error rates in data sets with large numbers of tests resulted in highly conservative p-values and a very small number of false positives. this analysis found  <dig> probesets with statistically significant differences between strains. because genes expressed differently at the two ages, but not between the two strains, likely represent normal developmental process, we focused on the  <dig> probesets that varied between the strains. the  <dig> probesets can be divided into two groups. one group is the  <dig> probesets with relatively high expression in nod and low expression in c57bl/ <dig> mice. the second group contains the  <dig> probesets with relatively low expression in nod and high expression in c57bl/ <dig> mice.

hierarchical clustering
although our use of the bonferroni correction reduces the number of false positives on our gene lists, it increases the occurrence of type  <dig> errors . to capture genes whose expression followed the same pattern seen for the lists of  <dig> and  <dig> probesets described above, we conducted hierarchical clustering on  <dig> probesets and organized them into a "gene-tree". using the  <dig> probesets with relatively high expression in nod to guide us towards sub-branches within the gene-tree, we found an extra  <dig> probesets that had a similar expression pattern. the combined total of  <dig> probesets  were themselves organized using the gene tree feature in genespring program . the  <dig> probesets with significant differences between strains differences , are marked by black bars. statistical analysis of the  <dig> genes  indicated strain differences with a p-value of  <dig>  or less. this result demonstrates that all  <dig> probesets clearly have higher levels of expression in nod than c57bl/ <dig> mice. by the same approach, we found an extra  <dig> probesets with the same expression pattern as the  <dig> probesets with lower expression in nod than c57bl/ <dig> mice . in total, the hierarchical cluster analysis yielded an additional  <dig> probesets that show expression differences between the two strains.

molecular networks
the list of  <dig> probesets was uploaded to the ingenuity server which contains information about millions of known connections between individual genes. our list of  <dig> probesets represented  <dig> different focus genes listed in the ingenuity pathway knowledge base  the remaining probesets represented genes about which the ipkb did not contain information and could not connect to other genes.

the database created three major networks. we merged those  <dig> networks and created a single network . in figure 2a, there are  <dig> focus genes  and  <dig> non-focus genes indicated by gray and white icons, respectively. the number of connections of the nine most connected genes  is presented in table  <dig> ifn-γ and tnfα had the greatest number of connections .

the list of  <dig> additional probesets obtained by hierarchical clustering analysis also was subjected to ingenuity pathways analysis . the  <dig> probesets represented  <dig> genes found in ipkb. ipa created two major networks.

the merged network from those two is presented in figure 2b, and it contain  <dig> focus genes and  <dig> non-focus genes. table  <dig> also shows the number of connections of the nine most connected genes  in the network from figure 2b. the largest numbers of connections again involved ifn-γ  and tnf-α .

discussion
in the nod animal model of autoimmune  diabetes, the first sign of pathology is seen at about 5-weeks of age  <cit> . as the animals get older, the infiltration of the pancreas with leukocytes, and the subsequent destruction of insulin producing β-cells, gets progressively worse until the mice become diabetic. to gain further insight into mechanisms and pathways involved, our study focused on the molecular abnormalities at 2– <dig> weeks of age  <cit> . we used comprehensive molecular characterization  at both the transcriptome and proteome levels  <cit> .

in order to gain insight from such large datasets, it is important to develop an effective strategy for data mining and analysis. the problems associated with analyzing expression data from a very large number of genes  have lead to development of alternative statistically approaches and tools. cluster analysis and principal component analysis have become popular tools for the analysis of expression array data  <cit> . when combined with further downstream data processing and/or data mining, these can be effective tools to gain more insight from a large dataset. however, many investigators are uncomfortable with the use of these clustering methods to define sets of genes that are differentially expressed when comparing different groups of biological samples. they want to know that the difference is statistically significant, i.e. has not just simply appeared by chance. to take advantage of the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses of each of these data analysis approaches, we have combined them. first, we used a traditional statistical analysis  with very stringent criteria and a multiple test correction to define a set of  <dig> genes that showed highly significant differences in expression levels between the two strains of mice. we also conducted a hierarchical clustering analysis of the gene expression dataset. then, we examined the resulting gene tree to find genes with expression patterns very similar to  the  <dig> genes. this process defined another  <dig> genes where the differences between the expression levels of the two strains did not reach the stringent criteria of statistical significance.

we have found that the best way to gain insights from such an analysis is to evaluate the biological "relatedness" of the genes by conducting a pathway analysis. the ingenuity data-mining tool uses knowledge from the literature to evaluate how best to connect all the genes on a list  to each other with the help of some non-focus genes. this approach does have a bias toward genes for which there is a lot of published data, and is not likely to connect a gene for which little more than its name is known. however, for the purpose of gaining a broad understanding of the underlying biological phenomena these newly defined genes cannot be used. they must be mined individually by different, and much more time-consuming, approaches. another advantage of using the pathway analysis to mine large gene lists is that it may help sort out false positives. any false positive gene on a list is not likely to be connected to the other genes because it would not likely be part of the underlying biological processes. therefore, that gene is also less likely to become a part of the network created by the ingenuity server.

when we conducted pathway analysis on the list of  <dig> probesets that showed highly significant differences between the two strains of mice, we created a network in which ifn-γ and tnf-α were the most central . the third highly connected gene in that network, tgf-β <dig>  is a multifunctional growth factor involved in many different immunological processes  <cit> . both ifn-γ and tnf-α are important for the process of reducing autoimmunity in the developing immune system  <cit> . furthermore, when combined with il1-β these cytokines are known to be directly cytotoxic to insulin producing beta-cells. this has been hypothesized to be an important mechanism of autoimmune diabetes  <cit> .

when we evaluated the network created by the  <dig> genes identified only by cluster analysis, we again found that tnf-α and inf-γ have the most connections to other genes in the network. this confirmed that genes on the two lists were highly connected to each other not just by expression patterns, but also by the underlying physiology. yet some of the other central genes in the network created from the list of  <dig> genes were different and may help to further define and interpret the network created from the list of  <dig> genes. first, we should consider il1-β, which, as mentioned above, is cytoxic to β-cells. second, one of the many roles of tgf-β <dig> is that it is an anti-inflammatory cytokine  <cit> . the network from the list of  <dig> genes contains three pro-inflammatory cytokines  among its most central genes. this would suggest that not only regulation of development of autoimmune t-lymphocytes, but also regulation of inflammatory responses may define the critical differences in the immune system of young mice that will, or will not, develop autoimmune diabetes at a later age. this suggests that a more detailed study of the interaction of regulatory processes for inflammation and autoreactive t-lymphocytes is merited.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper demonstrates how stringent statistical analysis can be combined with hierarchical clustering to gain much better insight from a set of expression array data. the combination identifies critical false negative genes missed by the statistical analysis, such that conclusions and models based on statistical data can be refined and expanded.
