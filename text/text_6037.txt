BACKGROUND
antibodies constitute the most rapidly growing class of human therapeutics and the second largest class of drugs after vaccines  <cit> . most of the growing number of antibodies entering the clinical trials are human  <cit>  and are derived from phage-display technology  <cit>  or from transgenic mice that express human immmunoglobulin genes  <cit> . however, the best mabs for clinical applications derive from natural human antibodies generated as a result of the in vivo immune response because they i) are products of the human and not animal repertoire, and ii) are of human origin, thus minimizing the risks of reactivity against self-antigens. lastly, iii) passive immunotherapy with human igg can confer immediate protection without the side effects linked to the use of chimeric or humanized mabs containing animal-derived amino acid sequences. furthermore, considerable evidence indicates that antibodies represent a new, although historically validated, approach to the development of therapies against bacterial and viral pathogens that causes disease in individuals with impaired immune response and/or for which there are few or no available drugs  <cit> .

ebv has long been used to immortalize human b-lymphocytes in vitro and to isolate human mab  <cit> , but the method was not routinely embraced due to its poor efficiency and because the resulting transformed cells are frequently unstable and fail to grow or secrete igg. agonists of toll receptor  <dig> , e.g., cpg odn  <dig> , have been reported to improve ebv infectivity and cloning efficiency  <cit> , however, there is no clear consensus as to the best conditions for their use and which subset of b-lymphocytes should be used. we applied the ebv immortalization procedure in the presence of different amounts of cpg with or without il- <dig> to  <dig> healthy donors selected on the basis of the high titer of cmv-specific igg in the blood and we obtained an immortalization efficiency not comparable to that recently reported  <cit> . therefore we re-evaluated all the steps crucial to cell immortalization, and established an optimized procedure of isolating human mabs from the repertoire of immune donors. the resulting method is highly reproducible, effective and rapid. further, it was validated by the successful isolation of clones of human b-lymphocytes that secrete high levels of igg that bind and neutralize the human cytomegalovirus . hcmv is a ubiquitous opportunistic virus that infects 50–90% of adult human populations and persists for the life of the human host after primary infection. hcmv infection of an immunocompetent individual generally results in subclinical disease; by contrast, hcmv infection of immunocompromised individuals may cause lethal infections  <cit> . indeed, hcmv remains the single most important pathogen in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  <cit>  as well as, in organ transplantation  <cit>  so that effective neutralizing mabs would make a major contribution to eliminate hcmv in these patients.

RESULTS
the isolation of fully human mab from those generated during the natural human immune response is likely to identify the most effective therapeutic antibodies  <cit> . many approaches have been used to generate human mab  <cit> , however, an efficient and reproducible process to isolate human mab with desired specificity from the natural repertoire is not available.

agonists of tlr <dig> have been reported to improve ebv infectivity and cloning efficiency  <cit> . however, it is known that tlr <dig> agonists, such as cpg odn  <dig>  protect against a wide range of viral pathogens  <cit> . with this in mind, we reasoned that the presence of cpg during the ebv infection might exert negative effects and we decided to separate activation and ebv infection in two sequential phases. we developed a technology for raising human mabs for clinical applications based on two discrete steps : first, purified human b-lymphocytes are treated with cpg <dig> and il- <dig>  next, after both additives are removed, the activated cells are infected with ebv in a distinct step. the new process was compared to a method using cpg <dig> and il- <dig> in the presence of ebv  <cit>   and a method using ebv alone  . different experimental settings were compared in pools of cells derived from  <dig> healthy donors, to minimize donor variability. the results clearly demonstrated that activation of cd22+ b-lymphocytes before ebv exposure leads to improved immortalization, as highlighted by the viability of cells following ebv transformation which is significantly higher than that obtained with both combined and basic conditions . the short-term viability of b lymphocytes immortalized following the basic procedure is higher than those of b lymphocytes treated with the combined procedure. this is attributable to the polyclonal activation elicited by ebv itself which is not paralleled by an efficient immortalization. indeed, it is well documented that exposure of human b-lymphocytes to ebv results in cell death of a proportion of cells and that b-lymphocytes are activated but not immediately immortalized following exposure to ebv  <cit> .

removal of the activating agents before immortalization significantly improves growth and viability of cd22+ b-lymphocytes allowing for a higher proportion of cells to be immortalized. indeed, when stimulation and ebv infection are performed separately rather than simultaneously, or with no stimulation at all, the cells exhibit increased proliferation potential and improved viability. in contrast, the combined presence of activating agents and ebv has adverse effects on both cell viability and ebv infectivity . the negative effects of the combined method on viability are surprising, given that cpg <dig> induces robust polyclonal activation and proliferation of b-lymphocytes  <cit>  and that these effects are significantly enhanced by il- <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported that tlr- <dig> triggering resulted in higher transformation rates of b cells infected with ebv  <cit>  but a comparison between ebv transformation in the presence of cpg <dig> and ebv and after sequential exposure of b cells to cpg <dig> and separately to ebv, was not investigated. the results obtained using different experimental setting on the same cell population clearly demonstrated that cpg <dig> and il- <dig> used in combination with ebv exert negative effects on cell transformation. it is conceivable that the detrimental effects are related to the anti-proliferative activity of anti-viral cytokines induced by cpg <dig>  <cit> . indeed, the significant levels of tlr <dig> expressed by resting b-lymphocytes are further up-regulated by cpg <dig> itself. increased tlr <dig> expression correlates with increased responsiveness to the ligand, indicating a positive feedback loop in which cpg <dig> enhances its own effects  <cit> . kinetic studies demonstrated that optimal concentrations of cpg <dig> combined with il- <dig> provide maximal cell stimulation after 2– <dig> days . these observations are in line with cell-cycle analyses demonstrating that, in the same time frame, more than 95% of b cells enter the cell cycle independently from their memory or naïve phenotype  <cit> .

the sequential method does not modify the expression of cd <dig>  which is the receptor for ebv  <cit> .

the next step was to correlate the efficiency of ebv infection to the expression of cd <dig>  which is directly upregulated by ebna <dig>  one of the earliest markers expressed by ebv-infected b-lymphocytes  <cit> , it is expresses at high levels on ebv-transformed b cells  <cit>  and its expression correlates with igg secretion  <cit> . the results demonstrated that cd <dig> expression  is higher on cells exposed to the polyclonal activators and ebv separately than on those exposed simultaneously .

the b-lymphocytes representing the whole repertoire of a selected donor immortalized with the sequential method show a significantly higher viability than those obtained with the combined method, and in consequence are easily clonable by limiting dilution, either in the presence or in the absence of polyclonal activators, such as cpg <dig> and il- <dig>  tlr <dig> expression is increased after ebv infection. thus bona fide, the addition of cpg <dig> during the cloning phase enhances cell growth. however, we observed that cloning efficiency may be independent of cpg <dig> and il- <dig> in some donors, suggesting that it is also dependent on the genetic background or physiological state of the donor. this issue warrants further investigation. the presence of cpg <dig> and il- <dig> during the cloning phase may also have practical relevance for screening procedures. for instance, trace amounts of cpg <dig> completely block hcmv infection in vitro, hampering screening by functional assays  <cit> . moreover, cpg <dig> is a potent inducer of cytokines, such as il- <dig> and ifn-γ, potentially interfering with a number of bioassays  <cit> .

the validity of the sequential method was evaluated by using it in a project to produce neutralizing human mabs against hcmv, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals and the most serious pathogenetic agent in transplant patients  <cit> . in the absence of other therapies such as vaccines  <cit> , these patients are treated with antivirals, which are often associated with considerable side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. hcmv is also the leading viral cause of congenital infection associated to significant birth defects and neurological damage for which no effective therapies are available before birth  <cit> . hyperimmune globulins specific for hcmv are beneficial in both conditions for the prevention and treatment of these infections  <cit> . further, transfer of memory b cells from immune animals to severely immunodeficient recipients confers long-term protection from lethal murine cmv infection. this indicates that the humoral immune response is effective against cmv infection in the absence of a t cell-mediated response  <cit> . natural human mabs with stronger neutralizing activity than that of currently available immunoglobulin preparations may be a decisive alternative in the prevention of primary and re-activated hcmv infections in immunosuppressed patients, or during high-risk pregnancies  <cit> .

using the sequential method, we obtained natural antibodies neutralizing hcmv infectivity by immortalizing b-lymphocytes from a healthy donor  and from a patient recovering from acute hcmv infection . high titers of anti-hcmv-specific igg coupled with the virus-neutralizing activity of the sera were the criteria for selecting the two donors from a larger panel . the immortalized b-lymphocytes were cloned by limiting dilution. after  <dig> weeks, clusters of cells growing in wells were appreciable and the igg concentration in the clone supernatants was 10– <dig> μg/ml/ <dig> cells, as determined by means of an immunoenzymatic method, measuring igg concentrations in the media normalized for cell densities. clones producing hcmv-specific igg were identified by different primary screening assays. in a first experiment a total of  <dig>  clones were tested either by their binding to specific hcmv envelope glycoprotein domains   <cit> , or by their ability to neutralize hcmv infectivity in vitro  <cit> . the effect on hcmv infectivity was determined by an hcmv microneutralization assay based on the evaluation of the ability of clone supernatants to interfere on the infectivity of hcmv ad <dig> strain  in human embryo lung fibroblasts . this strategy yielded  <dig> clones producing mabs specific for the gb, and  <dig> for gh. nine of these displayed a neutralizing activity of > 40%. those supernatants that were negative in the gb and gh elisas, or in the neutralization assay were also screened in an elisa that detects human igg that bind to hcmv virion proteins extract , and  <dig> samples were further selected by this screening assay. in a second experiment, the immortalized b-lymphocytes were cloned by limiting dilution and after  <dig> weeks,  <dig> clones were screened directly for their neutralizing activity. of these,  <dig> produced igg with a neutralizing activity of > 40%, among these,  <dig> wells were found to bind gb, while the remaining  <dig> did not bind in either the gb or gh domains.

four clones has been chosen as promising candidates for future clinical applications on the basis of their intrinsic characteristics: 10b <dig> and 8c <dig> showed a very strong binding to gb glycoprotein and 1f <dig> to gh glycoprotein; 26a <dig> has the strongest neutralizing activity. all clones were expanded in the absence of cpg <dig>  il- <dig> and a feeder layer, and further characterized. mabs10b <dig> and 8c <dig> proved to be specific for the hcmv envelope glycoprotein gb, mab 1f <dig> for the hcmv envelope glycoprotein gh and mab 26a <dig> recognized a viral antigen not yet characterized, as inferred from the reactivity on the hcmv virion proteins extract .

all of the antibodies neutralized the infectivity of the hcmv ad <dig> laboratory strain in human helf as well as that of the vr <dig> clinical isolate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells , indicating that they are neither strain nor cell-specific. lastly, none of the antibodies bound the helf or huvec . the specificity of the hcmv neutralizing activity was confirmed by the lack of significant neutralization of herpes simplex virus - <dig> in vero cells .

clone stability was tested by maintaining the cells for  <dig> months in serum-free medium without cpg <dig> or other additives, and the mabs recovered in the supernatant at a concentration of 20– <dig> μg/ml. all purified igg maintained their neutralizing activity; mab 26a <dig> demonstrated a potent neutralizing capacity, with a calculated inhibitory concentration  <dig>  of  <dig>  μg/ml against ad <dig> in helf , and of  <dig> μg/ml against vr <dig> in huvec . the potency of 26a <dig> against both hcmv strains was ~ <dig> fold higher than the reference anti-hcmv igg , currently used in transplant recipients. the inhibitory activity of mab 26a <dig> against the whole viral replicative cycle was confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization assay . the mechanism of virus neutralization is subject of ongoing studies.

c. sera were tested in the hcmv microneutralization assay using the ad <dig> strain and helf  <cit> . numbers indicate dilution of serum required for 50% inhibition of hcmv infectivity.

c. antibodies were tested using the hcmv microneutralization assay, with the hcmv ad <dig> strain and helf. results are expressed as % of inhibition of virus infectivity. data represent the mean ± s.d. of 3– <dig> experiments.

the broad and robust neutralizing activity of mab 26a <dig> encouraged us to generate recombinant igg suitable as prophylactic or therapeutic tools in clinical applications. to this aim, cells were submitted for 5' race pcr amplification, the pcr products of two amplification reactions were cloned using a eco ri restriction site in a sequencing vector and used for transforming top <dig> e. coli. a single vh and vl sequence was obtained from each cell culture, confirming that each original culture was clonal .

the sequences encoding the vh and vl regions of mab 26a <dig> were cloned in expression vectors for the expression of mab 26a <dig> variable regions as recombinant igg <dig>  the recombinant mab 26a <dig> confirmed the neutralizing activity of the natural mab 26a <dig> .

the sequential method is also effective when used with frozen cells. indeed, it was possible to select antibodies neutralizing hsv- <dig> and hsv- <dig> infectivity from frozen pbmcs from an hsv and hiv co-infected individual .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provides proof of concept that good-quality, fully human mabs with desired specificity and biological activity can be generated with the sequential method. the strengths of this approach are: i) it allows the selection of human monoclonal igg to a variety of antigens, from a small sample of fresh or frozen peripheral blood, ii) it is rapid, iii) screening can be performed using a variety of assays, including functional assays, iv) the mabs of interest can be easily produced from the original clone as recombinant proteins suitable for clinical applications, and v) the generation of igg-secreting polyclonal populations can be considered as a library of antibody-secreting cells that can be used to select mabs with specificities not considered when cells were immortalized.

the technology described has proven to be more reproducible, efficient and rapid than previously reported techniques, and can be adopted at low overall costs by any cell biology laboratory for the development of fully human mabs for immunotherapeutic uses. it can be applied to the isolation of natural mabs from individuals affected by a variety of diseases, ranging from infectious diseases to cancer and autoimmune diseases. it allows the isolation of a large repertoire of human mabs with desired specificities to be selected from a small  volume of peripheral blood, and can be used with either fresh or frozen b-lymphocytes. moreover, direct cloning by limiting dilution and robust igg production allow the generation of panels of mabs with different specificities, thus allowing the development of mab cocktails for immunotherapy  <cit> .
