BACKGROUND
cabbage  is one of the most cultivated vegetables worldwide. in  <dig>  more than two million hectares were estimated to be under production, with an average yield of  <dig>  tonnes per hectare . cabbage fusarium wilt  is a destructive fungal disease caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans, which for many years has caused severe losses to cabbage yields all over the world. cfw was first discovered in the usa in  <dig>  and then in japan and several other countries in the following decades  <cit> . in recent years, cfw was discovered in several provinces in china and has spread rapidly . it is a typical soil-borne disease that is hard to control by traditional methods such as chemicals and crop rotation. the most effective control has been the use of resistant cabbage varieties . therefore, the development and use of new resources have become the main goals in current resistance breeding programs for cabbage.

it has been reported that two races in the formae speciale conglutinans could infect cabbage  <cit> . race  <dig> was found in several countries, and the inheritance of cabbage resistance to it was determined to be of the single dominant type  <cit> . race  <dig> was found only in the us and russia, and the mode of inheritance of resistance to it remains unclear  <cit> .

although cfw is a major disease for cabbage, not enough attention has been paid to it, and research on cfw is still at a preliminary stage. several molecular markers have been developed for the foc gene  <cit> , but, until now, no reports have focused on gene analysis or on functional studies of candidate genes. in a previous study, we located the resistance gene on chromosome c <dig> of cabbage, with two indel markers flanking the gene at  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm  <cit> . currently, the large scale re-sequencing of plant genomes has allowed for the application of insertion/deletion  and single nucleotide polymorphism  markers. in addition, the b. oleracea genome sequence has recently been published  <cit> . this has significantly advanced map-based cloning in cabbage, which was originally labor-intensive. indel markers can be obtained easily, either using bioinformatic methods or from reliable visualization of alleles of different size  <cit> .

the objectives of the current study were  to fine map the foc <dig> gene using one double haploid  and one f <dig> population, and newly developed indel markers designed from the whole-genome re-sequencing data of the two parental lines  to analyze the genes that fell into the candidate genomic region, and finally identify the candidate gene.

RESULTS
resistance segregation of the dh and f <dig> populations
we obtained a total of  <dig> dh lines through microspore culture  <cit>  and over 4000 f <dig> individuals derived from the same parental lines through hand pollination. resistance segregation ratios in the dh and f <dig> populations were evaluated using the inoculation test. the result indicated that in the dh population,  <dig> lines showed immunity to fusarium wilt while  <dig> were highly susceptible. the χ <dig> goodness-of-fit test indicated that the segregation ratio fitted a 1: <dig> ratio in the dh population. of the  <dig> individuals in the f <dig> population,  <dig> plants were classified as resistant and  <dig> were classified as susceptible;  <dig> individuals were excluded because of an unclear resistance performance. the χ <dig> goodness-of-fit test fitted a 3: <dig> fusarium wilt resistance segregation ratio. these results indicated that the resistance in the two populations was controlled by a single dominant gene, which was consistent with the results from our prior study  <cit> .

mapping of foc1using the dh and f2populations
in an earlier study, we located the candidate gene in a  <dig>  cm genomic region on chromosome c <dig>  with two indel markers, m <dig> and a <dig>  flanking foc <dig> at  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm respectively  <cit> . based on this result, we designed additional indel primers in this region to map the foc <dig> gene more precisely . in addition, we obtained two pairs of simple sequence repeat  primers, r <dig> and r <dig>  described in a previous study in which the candidate gene was mapped to a linkage group with two markers flanking the gene at  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm  <cit> . a total of  <dig> markers were anchored to the genetic map using joinmap  <dig> , which matched to the physical map according to the positions of the markers . finally, using these markers and the dh population, we mapped the foc <dig> gene to a 382-kb genomic region between the s <dig> and a <dig> markers . moreover, the ssr markers indicated that this was the same region as the region reported in the previous study   <cit> .table  <dig>

 ten genes were annotated between markers v <dig> and s <dig> based on the reference genome sequence. the genetic structure for each recombinant type is depicted as black rectangles for homozygous susceptible alleles, white for homozygous susceptible alleles and grey for heterozygous alleles, respectively. the relative positions of markers on c <dig> were determined according to the b. oleracea genome sequence.



the flanking markers a <dig> and s <dig> obtained from the dh population were used to screen the f <dig> population for recombinant individuals, which were then evaluated for their resistance to fusarium wilt. next, more markers between a <dig> and s <dig> were used to genotype these individuals. as a result, the foc <dig> gene was narrowed to an 84-kb genomic region with v <dig> and s <dig> as the flanking indel markers . both indel markers had two recombinants with foc <dig> 

candidate gene analysis
from brad   <cit> , the genomic database for b. oleracea where the reference genome sequence for b. oleracea is now available  <cit> , we obtained the reference genome sequence and found that there were ten annotated genes in the 84-kb genomic region . however, we noticed that there was no gene numbered bol <dig> in the database, and the prediction of the sequence between bol <dig> and bol <dig> showed that no gene existed here. the best hits of the ten annotated b. oleracea genes to the brassica rapa and arabidopsis thaliana genome are shown in table  <dig>  annotation analysis of these genes from brad indicated that four of them were most likely related to disease resistance  <cit> : bol <dig> was predicted to have transcription factor activity; bol <dig>  bol <dig> and bol <dig> contained the most commonly conserved domain of r proteins: leucine-rich repeat , toll-interleukin receptor  domain and lrr domain respectively , based on the interpro domain annotation and gene ontology annotation for b. olerecea and a. thaliana obtained from brad.table  <dig>

primers were designed to amplify the full length of the four candidate genes in ten resistant inbred lines  and ten susceptible inbred lines  . however, no common sequence variation was found between the r_bulk and the s_bulk for all the four genes.table  <dig> 
primers used for cloning full length gene of four candidate genes




nevertheless, all the three genes seemed too short with only one r protein domain based on a common sense of tir-nbs-lrr or nbs-lrr type resistance gene  except bol <dig> as a transcription factor   <cit> . thus comparative genomics analysis was made between b. rapa genes and b. oleracea ones in the target region . the results showed that the homologous gene for bol <dig> in b. rapa was a putative tir-nbs-lrr type r gene bra <dig>  or brnl <dig>    <cit> , while the homologous gene for bol <dig> and bol <dig> was also a putative tir-nbs-lrr type r gene bra <dig>  or brtnl <dig>  . to further analyze these genes, the target genomic sequence of b. olerecea containing the three genes was submitted to the fgensh program   <cit>  to conduct gene prediction. because the reference line was highly susceptible in our inoculation test which might affect the prediction result, the re-prediction program used the target sequence of the resistant parental line p <dig> 

the results indicated that the re-predicted gene bol <dig>  designated as re-bol <dig>  was a putative tir-nbs-lrr gene with high identity to bra <dig>  while the other two genes bol <dig> and bol <dig> were re-predicted to be another putative tir-nbs-lrr gene, named re-bol <dig> which showed high identity to bra <dig> .figure  <dig>

the cdna sequences showed high identity to the re-predicted genes’ sequences . the b. olerecea transcriptome reads mapping results further confirmed the re-prediction result . thus, we obtained two re-predicted b. oleracea genes as the candidates, both of which were putative tir-nbs-lrr type r genes.

to further identify which one was the most likely candidate gene for cfw resistance, primers were designed to obtain both full length dna and cdna of the two genes from ten resistant cabbage inbred lines including the resistant parent  and ten susceptible lines including the susceptible parent  in order to conduct sequence alignment and mutation loci analysis . the results showed that no consistent variation was found between the r_bulk and the s_bulk for the gene re-bol <dig>  while for re-bol <dig>  the cdna from the ten r_bulk lines showed a high identity of  <dig> % and no indel was found. the cdna from the ten s_bulk lines also showed high identity. when the r_bulk and s_bulk lines were compared, two types of indels in the s_bulk were found; one was a 10-bp deletion in two sequences and the other was a 1-bp insertion in the other eight sequences . both indels caused frameshifts in the open reading frames that resulted in terminating mutations in the susceptible lines .table  <dig>

thus, the newly predicted gene re-bol <dig> was considered as a candidate gene for cfw resistance, with a total length of  <dig>  kb, cds length of  <dig>  kb, eight exons and seven introns . the candidate gene was predicted to encode a tir-nbs-lrr type protein containing five conserved domains including one tir domain, one nbs domain and three lrr domains according to a pfam sequence search result    <cit> .

validation of the foc1gene
to verify re-bol <dig> as the candidate gene for cabbage fusarium wilt resistance gene foc <dig>  primers were designed to obtain the two indel loci sequence from  <dig> resistant cabbage inbred lines  and  <dig> susceptible lines  . together with the sequences of the former  <dig> lines, we conducted sequence alignment.table  <dig> 
primers used for two indel loci analysis in  <dig> lines




the sequences from the  <dig> r_bulk lines showed high identity and no indel was found at the two loci. the  <dig> sequences from the ten s_bulk lines also showed high identity. when the r_bulk and s_bulk lines were compared, two types of indels in the s_bulk were found as was described above: sequences of  <dig> lines matched the 1-bp insertion and sequences of other  <dig> lines matched the 10-bp deletion. however, sequence of one line  in the s_bulk matched neither of the two types of indels. as we didn’t obtain the full length cdna of the gene in these lines, we concluded that there might be other types of variation that caused loss of gene function. the result of  <dig> lines’ sequences alignment further validated that re-bol <dig> was a most likely candidate for foc <dig> 

discussion
fusarium wilt and cabbage resistance breeding
cfw is a soil-borne disease that is hard to control by traditional physical or chemical methods. therefore, cfw has spread quickly across china from beijing in  <dig> to the hebei, gansu, shanxi, and shaanxi provinces where it is now present. thus, the application of resistant varieties is of great significance . indeed, their application has often been cited as a good example of using a plant’s own power to overcome fungal disease. two factors account for this: firstly, the inheritance of cabbage resistance to race  <dig> is single dominant  <cit> , as was also shown in our prior study  <cit> , and this meant that the r gene could be used easily in the f <dig> progeny; and secondly, although two races in the forma speciale conglutinans can infect cabbage, only race  <dig> is found worldwide, while race  <dig> has been reported only in the usa and russia  <cit> , indicating that the immutability of the pathogen over decades has also contributed to the successful use of the single dominant r gene. because of the significance of this r gene, it is necessary to discover the mechanism by which this r gene overcomes cfw.

for many years, mas has promoted the traditional breeding process. however, few studies have reported molecular markers for foc <dig>  pu et al.  <cit>  located the r gene on a linkage group, with two ssr markers flanking the gene at  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm respectively without chromosome information, and in a previous study, we located the r gene on chromosome c <dig>  with two indel markers flanking the gene at  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm  <cit> . in this study, we further refined the map and identified a candidate gene for foc <dig>  the results reported here will be useful for cabbage breeders because they may facilitate mas in the breeding process.

map-based cloning of foc1using indel markers and two populations
traditional molecular marker assays are usually labor-intensive and time-consuming, and the markers, like ssrs, that are used are frequently of low polymorphism and not reliable. further, they often produce complicated stripes when the pcr products are isolated in the gels. in recent years, as more and more plant genome sequences become available including b. oleracea genome  <cit> , indel and snp markers have become the markers of choice because they are generally obtained easily using bioinformatic method and their pcr products are more reliable and easier to detect. in this study, for example, we easily acquired  <dig> pairs of indel primers on one chromosome and although we used only a small number of them, the polymorphic primers accounted for 75% of all.

in this study, the indel primers were designed based on the cabbage reference sequence and the whole-genome re-sequencing data for the parental lines. therefore, the polymorphic primers accounted for a relative higher percentage. also, genome-sequence-based indel primers allow us to quickly design and add more markers to the target interval on the chromosome in order to narrow the mapping interval. as a result, we successfully mapped the r gene to chromosome c <dig> in a time-saving way based on the dh and f <dig> populations.

most characterized r genes reside in clusters rather than being distributed equally on chromosomes  <cit> . here also, the candidate region harbored two tir-nbs-lrr genes: re-bol <dig> and re-bol <dig> 

plant resistance gene to disease caused by fusarium oxysporum
as far as we know, more than  <dig> r genes have been cloned in the past decades  <cit> . the main categories of these genes include the coiled coil-nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat  class, the tir-nbs-lrr class, the kinase class, the lrr kinase class and the extracellular lrrs  <cit> . the most significant tir-nbs-lrr class r gene may be the tobacco n gene conferring resistance to tobacco mosaic virus  <cit> . for n gene, all the three conserved domains are indispensable for a normal function  <cit> .

until now, the fusarium wilt r genes have been cloned in three plant species: arabidopsis, tomato, and melon . the function of the melon r gene, fom- <dig>  has not yet been established  <cit> . rfo <dig> in arabidopsis was reported to be a wall-associated kinase, which was neither a representative r gene nor race-specific  <cit> . on the other hand, the cfw r gene was race-specific and can be overcome by race  <dig>  <cit> . in tomato, i- <dig> was shown to be a typical r gene, with the encoded protein belonging to the cc-nbs-lrr type  <cit> . a low identity of 41% was found among the three cloned r genes, indicating that although all three were r genes to fusarium wilt, different mechanisms may be involved. we also performed whole-genome blast searches with a cut-off value of < e- <dig>  using the rfo <dig>  i- <dig> and fom- <dig> sequences as the queries. no matches to these sequences were found in the b. oleracea genome. thus, we can infer that foc <dig> may be a novel r gene. the results of our study showed that the candidate gene for foc <dig> was a putative tir-nbs-lrr type r gene. the cdna sequences of the ten resistant and ten susceptible lines revealed two types of indel mutations in the cdna of the susceptible lines that resulted in frameshifts and translation termination. further sequence analysis of the two indel loci from  <dig> lines confirmed the two types of indels. thus, we inferred that the re-modeled gene re-bol <dig> was the most likely candidate gene for foc <dig>  however, further work is needed to verify the function of foc <dig> by transformation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we fine mapped a novel cabbage resistance gene to fusarium wilt using one dh population and one f <dig> population, analyzed the genes that fell into the candidate region and identified the re-modeled gene re-bol <dig>  a putative tir-nbs-lrr type r gene as the candidate for the cabbage fusarium wilt resistance gene foc <dig>  this work may lay the foundation for marker-assisted selection in cabbage resistance breeding as well as for further function analysis of the foc <dig> gene.
