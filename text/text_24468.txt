BACKGROUND
paclitaxel is an important anticancer diterpenoid discovered in the bark of the yew taxus brevifolia <cit>  and its chemical structure was elucidated in  <dig>  <cit> . it can inhibit the division of actively growing tumor cells by preventing microtubule depolymerization  <cit>  and has become increasingly important in the treatment of a number of major cancers. unfortunately, yew trees grow slowly and large amounts of bark are required for paclitaxel production  <cit> . various attempts to obtain alternative sources of paclitaxel have been made with some success  <cit> , and many pharmaceutical companies now employ semisynthetic techniques using the taxane skeleton obtained from plants. biosynthesis of paclitaxel in taxus is thought to involve  <dig> steps from geranylgeranyl diphosphate , and  <dig> paclitaxel biosynthetic genes have been identified   <cit> . since the discovery of the paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus taxomyces andreanae from t. brevifolia <cit> , more than  <dig> genera of paclitaxel-producing fungi have been isolated from taxus and non-taxus plant species  <cit> . low productivity of paclitaxel in endophytic fungi prevents these organisms from being used in commercial production of paclitaxel, and has raised the unlikely hypothesis that these fungi do not synthesize paclitaxel independently, but instead accumulate it in their cell wall from taxus cells  <cit> . this highlights the need to study the genes that govern paclitaxel biosynthesis in endophytic fungi and their evolutionary origin  <cit> . pcr-based screening using the taxus nucleotide sequence for taxadiene synthase , a unique gene in the formation of the taxane skeleton, has been used to screen for endophytic fungi with the potential to synthesize paclitaxel, and has indicated that the gene sequences are highly conserved between plant and endophytic fungi  <cit> . however, a recent pcr based study using primers for ts and 10-deacetylbaccatin iii-10-o-acetyltransferase  on  <dig> fungal isolates from t. media with diverse genotypes, did not find high homology between plant and fungal genes  <cit> . also heinig et al.  <cit>  isolated several endophytic fungi from taxus spp. including ef <dig>  that could not independently synthesize paclitaxel, and did not possess genes with significant similarity to known paclitaxel biosynthetic genes. fungal isolates from the fusarium solani species complex have been reported to synthesize paclitaxel  <cit> , and a genome sequence has been constructed for a member of this complex  <cit> . however, the ability of this f. solani isolate to synthesize paclitaxel is unknown. to date, neither global identification nor evolutionary analyses have been performed on endophytic fungi demonstrated to independently synthesize paclitaxel. insights into the genes and origin of the complete pathway could provide information on the origin of endophytic fungal genes in the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway. this information could also facilitate metabolic engineering for the industrial production of paclitaxel from fungi.

here, we report the genome sequence of penicillium aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig>  an endophytic fungus of hazel that we have confirmed to independently synthesize paclitaxel, and we have identified a large set of potential genes involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis. these candidate paclitaxel biosynthetic genes are significantly different from those found in the taxus genus and seem to have evolved independently, indicating that horizontal gene transfer is an unlikely explanation. this genomic information helps elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the synthesis of paclitaxel in endophytic fungi and will make it possible to realize the full potential of p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> as a source of industrial paclitaxel.

RESULTS
genome sequence assembly and annotation
we isolated an endophytic p. aurantiogriseum fungus, nrrl  <dig>  from hazel and demonstrated that it can produce paclitaxel by comparing our lc-ms and 1h nmr data with the reported the lc-ms and 1h nmr data of paclitaxel  <cit>  . to investigate the paclitaxel biosynthetic genes and their evolutionary origin, we sequenced the genome of p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig>  a total of  <dig> , <dig> 100-nt paired-end reads were obtained and assembled into  <dig>  contigs that yielded a genome size of  <dig>  mb . we used genemark  <cit> , twinscan  <cit>  and genewise  <cit>  to predict genes in p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig>  the final gene set contains  <dig>  genes. gene ontology analysis categorized the gene set into  <dig> functional groups . subsets of these functional groups were annotated as part of the ‘metabolic process’  or ‘secondary metabolic process’  categories. kegg analysis assigned  <dig>  genes to  <dig> pathways. among them,  <dig> genes were found to be involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid backbone,  <dig> genes in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and  <dig> genes in phenylalanine metabolism. transcription factor analysis revealed that  <dig> transcription factors were found in the genome of p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> including c2h <dig>  c <dig>  zn2cys <dig>  gata , haca, apses, hlh, bzip, stp <dig>  nf-y, sre, cp <dig>  phd, rfx . analysis of membrane transporters in the genome of p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> identified a total of  <dig> predicted multidrug transporters that are presumably involved in transportation and detoxification of secondary metabolites . among them,  <dig> belong to abc transporters .

paired end reads derived from a 280 bp-insert library were sequenced using illumina/gaii technology.

in order to identify genes involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis in p. aurantiogriseum, a protein search  was performed against the genome of p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> using the  <dig> reported paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in taxus. this search revealed putative homologs to  <dig> genes encoding phenylalanine aminomutase , geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase , taxane 5α-hydroxylase , taxane 13α-hydroxylase , taxane 7β-hydroxylase , taxane 2α-hydroxylase  and taxane 10β-hydroxylase  of taxus . in addition, an acyltransferase  was identified in the p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> gene set by blastp search against genbank databases.

comparative analysis of paclitaxel biosynthetic genes between p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> and its host
potential paclitaxel biosynthetic gene homologs with identity > 30% to the  <dig> reported paclitaxel biosynthetic genes were found in the paclitaxel-producing hazel  <cit> . the most conserved genes were ggps and pam with amino acid identities of 62% and 63%, respectively . comparison of the paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in host hazel  against p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> genome showed that their paclitaxel biosynthetic genes were not highly conserved, sharing only 21% to 62% sequence identities . another strain of endophytic fungus p. aurantiogriseum was also isolated from the host plant taxus baccata and was shown to synthesize taxane   <cit> . we compared p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> genome against the paclitaxel genes in t. baccata  and again found paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> and paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in t. baccata were quite different, only 19% to 65% identical in amino acid sequences .

comparative analysis of p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> with an endophytic fungus ef <dig> 
recently the genome of an endophytic fungus ef <dig> isolated from taxus spp. that was incapable of independent paclitaxel synthesis was sequenced  <cit> . comparison of the paclitaxel biosynthetic candidate genes from p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> with ef <dig> revealed only potential similarity to pam , ggpps , and p <dig>  .

phylogenetic analysis of p. aurantiogriseum nrrl 62431
comparison of the p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> and f. solani genome sequences did not reveal any significant similarity to taxadiene synthase  in taxus by blastp search. position-specific iterative blast  uses a list of all known closely related proteins to find more distant relatives and searching against genbank database revealed homologs in some fungi and prokaryotes to the n terminal cyclase domain of ts in taxus. interestingly, one gene from the bacterial genus mycobacterium showed high similarity to the plant ts, and their close relationship was further supported by the phylogenetic analysis , which implies the potential lateral gene transfer from plants to mycobacteria. the phylogenetic analysis also clearly showed that land plants, fungi, mycobacterium, and other bacteria formed three separate clades, which suggest that no recent gene transfer from the plant hosts to endophytic fungi has taken place. wildung et al. found ts includes an n-terminal targeting sequence for localization and processing in the plastids  <cit> . this makes the gene transfer from endophytic fungi to plant less likely . the absence of a homolog in the paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungi p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> and f. solani to ts in taxus suggests that p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> and f. solani may have a unique enzyme catalyzing the reaction towards taxadiene. this phenomenon is important and deserves further investigation.

the ggpps in green plants formed a strong clade with those from cyanobacteria, which implies the endosymbiotic gene transfer likely took place in the common ancestor of green plants. pau_p <dig>  pau_p <dig> in p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> and the biochemically characterized ggpps in fungi p. paxilli clustered with the potential homologs from animals, choanoflagellates, stramenopiles, and some bacteria, which suggested a bacterial origin as the common ancestor of these eukaryotes. another gene pau_p <dig> in p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig>  which shows 35% identity with taxus ggpps, was also included in our phylogenetic analysis. this gene and other similar eukaryotic genes formed a strongly supported clade, suggesting a distinctly different origin from the above ggppss .

genes with high similarity to acyltransferases and p450s in green plants and fungi, including p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig>  formed distinct branches in their own phylogenetic trees . this suggested their independent evolution in plants and fungi. all the acyltransferases and p <dig> in taxus clustered together, suggesting that recent gene duplication took place after the split of taxus from other plants.

the phylogenetic tree constructed reveals that taxus pam cluster as a sister branch of pal  in land plants and further formed a clade with homologs from fungi including p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> . the homologs from animals and other eukaryotes showed a highly supported clade within bacterial taxa , suggesting a different prokaryotic origin from that in plants and fungi. given the wide prevalence of pam and its possible function in other pathways, ancient gene transfer between plants and fungi may have happened in the ancestors of the plants and fungi, with the transfer direction and other details unknown.

discussion
biosynthesis of paclitaxel in taxus is thought to involve  <dig> steps from geranylgeranyl diphosphate and  <dig> genes involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis have been identified and well characterized. however, little is known about the taxol biosynthetic genes in the endophytic fungi or their evolutionary origin. recently it was controversially suggested that paclitaxel synthesis detected in a range of fungal endophytes was a result of residual taxanes synthesized by the host  <cit> . however this theory ignores the discovery of paclitaxel synthesizing endophytic fungi found on non-paclitaxel hosts  <cit>  and that stierle et al.in their seminal work demonstrated de novo synthesis of paclitaxel occurred in pure fungal endophyte cultures using both  acetic acid and l- phenylalanine as precursors  <cit> . we found relatively small amounts of paclitaxel was normally synthesized by p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig>  but that the level was increased about 5-fold, from  <dig>  mg/l to  <dig>  mg/l with the addition of methyl jasmonate and phenylalanine to the culture medium. in addition, the fungal cells used in our study did not have contact with the host plant for more than twelve passages, again refuting the possibility that paclitaxel from p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> occurred via passive release of taxanes accumulated in endophytic fungal cell walls from its host hazel.

in order to provide insight into the evolutionary origins of paclitaxel synthesis we sequenced the genome of p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig>  potential gene candidates involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified by homology with existing paclitaxel biosynthetic genes from taxus. the independent origin of ggpps, acyltransferase, p <dig> and pam in the endophytic p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> and in the host taxus were universally supported by the distinct conserved amino acid sites in the multiple sequence alignments . this data supports the findings of xiong et al., who found only a  <dig> % identity of nucleic acid sequence between t. media and the putative ts from endophytic fungi isolated from t. media, and  <dig> % identity between putative bapt segments and the t. media gene  <cit> . the high similarities of the previously identified sequences of ts, bapt in t. andreanae <cit>  and dbat in cladosporium cladosporioides md <dig>  <cit>  with the homologs in taxus  that fueled speculation about the origins of paclitaxel biosynthesis in fungi, are likely to represent potential cross contamination between endophytic fungi and host dna.

there is precedent for the independent development of the same biosynthetic pathway in plants and fungi. like paclitaxel, gibberellins  are complex diterpenoid compounds. gas were first isolated as metabolites from rice fungal pathogen gibberella fujikuroi   <cit> . although f. fujikuroi and higher plants produce structurally identical gas, profound differences have been found in the ga pathways and enzymes of plants and fungi  <cit> . the substantial differences in genes and enzymes indicate that plants and fungi have evolved their complex ga biosynthesis pathways independently and the possibility of horizontal gene transfer of ga genes between the plants and the fungi is highly unlikely  <cit> . a similar situation seems to have taken place in the paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway in fungi and plants. only  <dig> potential homologs to the  <dig> known paclitaxel biosynthetic genes were identified from p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> or f. solani, supporting the divergence of the two biosynthetic pathways. the fact that putative candidates for some of the steps in paclitaxel synthesis can be found in fungi with the ability to synthesize paclitaxel suggests that only specific enzymatic sites associated with enzymatic activity might be conserved, while the overall protein structure may differ.

in the past few years, some efforts have been made worldwide to engineer fungi by transferring paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in taxus to fungi. most metabolic engineering attempts were based on the assumption that paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in fungus and taxus plant are interchangeable  <cit> . however, such metabolic engineering attempts have not been successful. although candidate genes involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis still need be biochemically characterized, evidence from our genome study provides a greater understanding of their evolutionary origins. this understanding may result in a better-informed engineering approach that significantly improves paclitaxel biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in endophytic fungus p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> are quite different from those in hosts c. avellana and t. baccata in terms of amino acid sequences and may have a distinctly different evolutionary pattern. the relationship between paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in p. aurantiogriseum nrrl  <dig> and the homologs in its hosts are more complex than expected, and we have provided evidence that horizontal gene transfer is unlikely to have occurred. the genomic resources generated in our study provide new insights into the evolution of enzymes that might involve in the biosynthesis of paclitaxel in fungi and will likely facilitate production of larger quantities of this compound from fungi for the treatment of cancer patients.
