BACKGROUND
b-lymphocytes play a major role in humoral immunity and alterations in b cell development can cause certain types of autoimmune diseases  <cit> . the secretion of self-reactive antibodies by b-lymphocytes significantly contributes to disease pathogenesis  <cit> . in addition to the secretion of autoantibodies, self-reactive b cells also present autoantigens on their surface to stimulate pathogenic t cells. in autoimmune diseases, the abnormal recognition of autoantigens by self-reactive b cells and t cells leads to severe tissue damage. moreover, autoreactive b-lymphocytes are characterized by a deregulated cytokine milieu reflecting the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- <dig> , interferon-gamma , il- <dig> and tgf-beta, all of which can trigger dendritic cell migration, macrophage activation or affect the regulatory role of t cells  <cit> . common strategies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases include the use of immunosuppressive agents such as steroids, cytotoxic drugs or immunomodulatory agents to restore homeostasis in the immune system and depress the autoimmune response  <cit> . these therapeutic agents offer symptomatic relief by inhibiting general inflammatory responses, but they do not exclusively target the misdirected immune cells that are causing the disease. many standard therapeutic approaches affect all immune cells, regardless of specificity, function or activation status. current therapeutic strategies aim to eliminate various pathogenic cell populations without targeting self-reactive memory b cells directly  <cit> . with the help of a model antigen well characterized in the human system we aim to demonstrate the antigen-specific targeting of human b-lymphocytes via their b cell receptor , which can offer a novel and promising alternative approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases  <cit> . we used protein engineering to generate fusion proteins consisting of a cell-specific binding domain  fused to an effector domain . the most potent recombinant immunotoxins today are based on truncated versions of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a  . the tetanus toxoid fragment c  is often used as a model antigen because many people worldwide are vaccinated with tetanus toxoid, and the well-established ttc fragment is characterized by a frequency of  <dig>  % ttc-reactive memory b cells within the b cell pool without a recent booster vaccination  <cit> . the first requirement for a functional toxic fusion protein is the specific binding to the bcr of self-reactive b cells, followed by receptor-mediated internalization, the release of the catalytic moiety from the endosomes for intracellular transport from the golgi into the endoplasmic reticulum, and finally its cytosolic release. this allows eta’ to exert its cytotoxic activity via adp-ribosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor  <dig> , leading to efficient inhibition of protein synthesis and ultimately to apoptosis  <cit> . the new fusion protein undergoes rapid receptor-mediated endocytosis via the bcr  <cit> . we generated a ttc-eta’ fusion protein for the specific depletion of ttc-reactive b-lymphocytes isolated from human blood. for straightforward staining purposes of ttc-specific cell populations we developed a ttc-snap-tag fusion protein allowing the covalent coupling of the fusion protein to benzylguanine-conjugated fluorescent dyes to examine binding kinetics at b cell surfaces  <cit> . even if expressed in two different expression systems, both proteins bound specifically to ttc-reactive cells with similar binding characteristics. further, the ttc-eta’ fusion protein demonstrated specific cytotoxicity towards human ttc-reactive memory b cells ex vivo. the results of previous investigations performed by volkman et al. suggested that human tt-antibody responses can be inhibited specifically in vitro using a tt-ricin conjugate. using a modified approach and a more elaborated read out this work aims to confirm and quantify the selective depletion of human ttc-specific memory b cells by an antigen-eta’ fusion protein. based on the results of this study, we believe that this concept has a platform character and can be applied to generate powerful fusion proteins for immunotherapeutic approaches.

binding of ttc and ttc-eta’ to hybridoma cells
ttc-eta’ selectively targets ttc-reactive hybridoma cells and ttc-reactive memory b cells by binding to the ttc-reactive bcr. this binding activity is necessary for the biological function of the protein and was confirmed by investigating the ability of the fusion protein to bind ttc-reactive 5e <dig> hybridoma cells, which express the membrane-bound form of the bcr. the quantity of protein bound to the cell surface was determined by flow cytometry using an alexa fluor 488-conjugated anti-penta-his antibody. this confirmed that both ttc and ttc-eta’ bound to the ttc-reactive hybridoma cells, whereas no binding was observed on the control cell line  as shown in fig. 3a and b. both hybridoma cell lines showed similar amounts of b cell receptors on their cell surfaces  as determined by flow cytometry . coupling snap-ttc to bg- <dig> did not affect the functionality of the protein, and we were able to detect specific binding of the protein to the surface of ttc-reactive hybridoma cells but not to the control hybridoma cells by flow cytometry . the ttc-eta’ fusion protein exhibited a concentration-dependent binding to the ttc-reactive hybridoma cell line 5e <dig> compared to the control hybridoma cell line  <dig> -c <dig> as shown in fig. 4a and b.fig.  <dig> binding analysis of recombinant ttc-based proteins to ttc-reactive hybridoma cells. equimolar amounts  of ttc  and ttc-eta’  were used for binding analysis to the ttc-reactive hybridoma cell line 5e <dig>  compared to the control hybridoma cell line  <dig> -c <dig> . detection of bound proteins was carried out using an alexa fluor® 488-coupled anti-his <dig> antibody. staining with alexa fluor 488-coupled anti-his <dig> antibody  and unstained cells  served as controls. binding analysis of  <dig> nm snap-ttc coupled to the snap-surface®  <dig> fluorescence dye  to 5e <dig> hybridoma cells  and to the control hybridoma cell line  <dig> -c <dig> . unstained cells served as control

viability of hybridoma cells following treatment with ttc fusion proteins
after confirming the binding of the ttc fusion protein to the bcr on the surface of ttc-reactive 5e <dig> hybridoma cells, we investigated the toxicity of the ttc-eta’ fusion protein in vitro using an xtt cell viability assay. ttc-eta’ showed specific and dose-dependent toxicity towards ttc-reactive 5e <dig> hybridoma cells with a half inhibitory protein concentration  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm, but they showed no toxicity towards control hybridoma cells . furthermore, the ttc protein alone showed no toxicity towards either of the hybridoma cell lines .fig.  <dig> cytotoxic activity of recombinant ttc-eta’ on hybridoma cells. the hybridoma cell lines 5e <dig>  and  <dig> -c <dig>  were incubated with serial dilutions of ttc-eta’  and ttc  in complete rpmi  <dig> cell culture medium. after incubation at 37 °c and 5 % co <dig> for 72 h, the cells were refreshed with 50 μl rpmi  <dig> medium containing xtt/phenazine methosulfate and incubated for another 4 h. absorbance was measured at 450 nm and 630 nm on an elisa reader. the half maximal inhibitory protein concentration  relative to untreated control cells was calculated using graphpad prism software. the recombinant ttc-eta’ exhibits a dose-dependent cytotoxicity on the target hybridoma cell line 5e <dig> with an ec50of  <dig>  nm ±  <dig>  nm but has no effect on the control cell line  <dig> -c <dig>  these data represent the mean ± sd of three independent experiments performed in triplicates. *, p <  <dig> ; ** , p <  <dig> ; p <  <dig>  versus control cells



binding analysis of ttc fusion proteins to b-lymphocytes
next, we determined the binding capacity of the snap-ttc-bg- <dig> protein to polyclonally activated cd19+ b cells isolated from leukocyte filters of vaccinated blood donors by flow cytometry. figure  <dig> demonstrates that the frequencies of ttc-specific b cells remain low at day  <dig> after polyclonal activation  compared to residual signals of the control b cells . since the frequencies of ttc-specific b cells were extremely low after polyclonal activation in donors without a recent booster vaccination , the binding of the ttc fusion protein was additionally verified on plasma cells and memory b cells isolated at day  <dig> and day  <dig> from a blood donor vaccinated recently, respectively. the samples were exposed to the recombinant ttc protein followed by an alexa fluor 488-conjugated anti-penta-his secondary antibody. flow cytometry showed that tetanus-reactive cd27+ memory b cells  as well as tetanus-reactive cd27++cd38++ plasma cells  were detectable within the peripheral b cell pool shortly after booster vaccination. the frequencies of ttc-reactive memory b cells and plasma cells detected using the recombinant ttc protein was comparable to the use of the commercial fitc-conjugated ttc protein . ttc bound specifically to ttc-reactive memory b cells and plasma cells within the peripheral b cell pool.fig.  <dig> binding analysis of recombinant snap-ttc-bg <dig> on polyclonally activated cd19+ b cells. cd19+ b cells were isolated from leukocyte filters by density gradient centrifugation and magnetic cell separation with anti-cd <dig> beads. isolated b cells were activated by adding  <dig>  μg/ml cpg and 50 ng/ml il- <dig> to the cell culture medium. on day  <dig> of cultivation, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. surface a and intracellular b staining with the recombinant snap-ttc-bg  <dig>  was performed

cytotoxic activity of the recombinant ttc-eta’ protein on polyclonally activated memory b cells
having confirmed the targeting of ttc-reactive memory b cells, we next set out to measure the depletion effects of the ttc-eta’ protein. therefore, cd27+ memory b cells were activated polyclonally to develop into antibody-secreting cells  and were treated on day  <dig> of cultivation with  <dig> nm of recombinant ttc or ttc-eta’. next, elispot analyses were performed to determine the frequency of all igg-secreting cells as well as the tt-specific and ttc-specific igg-secreting cells. the ascs secreted igg antibodies at comparable frequencies after treatment with ttc or ttc-eta’ . the elispot assays were carried out with commercial tetanus toxoid  as the coating agent. when ttc protein was added to the cultures as the control protein, the ascs secreted the tt-igg antibodies at a frequency of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % . following the treatment with ttc-eta’ the frequency of tt-igg antibodies secreted by the ascs declined to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % . when tetanus toxoid fragment c  was used as the elispot coating agent, we observed a small increase in the frequencies of general igg antibodies following ttc-eta’ treatment . the depletion effect of the ttc-eta’ protein was confirmed by lower frequencies of secreted ttc-igg antibodies decreasing significantly from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  compared to treatment with the control protein ttc .fig.  <dig> cytotoxic activity of ttc-eta’ on ttc-specific polyclonally activated memory b cells. frequencies of igg , of tetanus toxoid -  and of ttc-specific igg  antibody-secreting cells  incubated with recombinant ttc  or ttc-eta’  protein on day  <dig> of polyclonal activation. the data are the results of  <dig> independent experiments using tt-coated plates  and  <dig> experiments using ttc-coated plates  and the corresponding total igg elispot assay . statistical analysis was performed using the wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test



discussion
the bacterial pbm <dig>  and the eukaryotic pms expression vectors are platforms that allow the convenient insertion of sequences to genetically fuse antibody fragments or peptide-based binding moieties to cytotoxic effector domains. we were able to generate immunotoxin expression vectors with ttc as the cell-binding domain with or without eta’ as the cytotoxic domain. ttc and ttc-eta’ were expressed in bacteria and purified by imac, with a yield comparable to similar fusion proteins expressed in earlier investigations, such as mog-eta’  <cit> . periplasmic expression of fusion proteins in bacteria avoids the labor-intensive process of refolding proteins accumulated in inclusion bodies. expression of the fusion proteins ttc and ttc-eta’ was scalable, and under the applied osmotic stress conditions we found that the immunotoxin was more than 95 % functional  <cit> . the ttc-reactive hybridoma cell line provides a simple and reliable test system for the ttc-eta’ fusion protein as a “model immunotoxin”. the recombinant ttc-eta’ protein demonstrated its functionality by specifically binding to its respective hybridoma cell line and displaying a dose-dependent cytotoxicity . the snap-tag promotes the rapid and efficient coupling of reagents such as fluorescent dyes, and the resulting fluorescent snap-tag conjugates can be used as diagnostic tools because the function of the snap-tag fusion partner is not affected  <cit> . here, we demonstrated the functionality of the snap-ttc-bg- <dig> protein by specific binding to ttc-reactive hybridoma  and human memory b cells  which was comparable to the binding activity of ttc and ttc-eta'. investigating ttc-specific ascs after polyclonal activation of human memory b cells by elispot we confirmed the specific binding of the ttc fusion proteins to cd27+ memory b cells isolated from human blood and their subsequent depletion resulting in a failure to generate ttc-specific ascs after polyclonal activation and plasma cell differentiation. compared to earlier developments by volkman et al.  <cit>  or grailer et al.  <cit>  we established an effective fusion protein expression platform enabling us to produce protein therapeutics in high yields and with homogeneous purity. using this technology, we were able to show that a peptide fragment of an antigen recognized by the bcr can be used as the cell-binding component of a cytotoxic fusion protein, ensuring that the immunotoxin targets an antigen-specific b cell population without affecting the entire b cell pool. both cell types  produce soluble antibodies that can encounter and intercept the ttc fusion proteins in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. nevertheless, the ttc-eta’ fusion protein showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity towards ttc-reactive 5e <dig> hybridoma cells with an ec <dig> value of  <dig>  nm . for ttc-eta’, we determined a half maximal effective concentration  value that is comparable to related fusion proteins based on an allergen fragment  <cit>  or a major autoantigen in multiple sclerosis  <cit> . the labeling of polyclonally activated cd19+ b cells by the snap-ttc-bg- <dig> protein showed that the number of tetanus-reactive b cells declines if a long time has elapsed since the last tetanus vaccination . self-reactive plasma cells are also rarely observed in the peripheral blood even in patients with active autoimmune disease  <cit>  and data about self-reactive memory b cells in these patients is limited. provided that their frequency is comparable with that of ttc-reactive b cells in vaccinated controls, it seems challenging to isolate and study these cells in patients with disease- or treatment-related lymphopenia. hence, future investigations should consider strategies of polyclonal activation and subsequent enrichment of these memory b cells to raise their abundance. and for some autoantigens the use of animal models seems still inevitable. we found that exposing the activated human memory b cell pool to  <dig> nm ttc-eta’ resulted in an 80 % inhibition of generated ttc-reactive igg secreting cells compared to the control treatment with the ttc protein lacking a toxic domain . these results clearly indicate that only the ttc-eta’ fusion protein significantly affected the generation of ttc-reactive ascs. self-reactive memory b cells have been shown to be resistant to many standard therapeutic approaches  <cit> . they represent plasma cell precursors that are easy to activate  <cit> .

we confirmed that it is possible to target antigen specific human memory b cells using novel cytotoxic fusion proteins containing part of the antigen as a cell-binding domain. this novel strategy will facilitate the development of targeted therapies based on the specific characteristics of each patient.

CONCLUSIONS
this protein engineering strategy can be used as a generalized platform approach for the construction of therapeutic fusion proteins with disease-relevant antigens as b cell receptor-binding domains, offering a promising approach for the specific depletion of autoreactive b-lymphocytes in b cell-driven autoimmune diseases.
