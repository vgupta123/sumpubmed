BACKGROUND
the organizer is a highly specialized and transient structure that has been found in all studied vertebrates. it was originally discovered in amphibians by spemann and mangold in  <dig> by its ability to induce much of a secondary body axis when transplanted to a host embryo  <cit> . these experiments were repeated with equivalent tissues in the chick , zebrafish , and mouse , demonstrating that organizer function is highly conserved and is essential for patterning of the basic body plan during gastrulation. in mouse, the early gastrula organizer  forms just anterior to the emerging primitive streak  at e <dig> , then gives rise to the mid-gastrula organizer  as the ps elongates towards the distal tip of the mouse embryo, and finally forms the morphologically visible node at e <dig>   <cit> . these organizer cell populations contribute to the axial mesoderm and notochord, and are the source of de that displaces the embryonic visceral endoderm  into the extra-embryonic region . although the organizer has been studied for more than  <dig> years, there are still relatively few genes that have defined expression in this highly specialized tissue.

one important and conserved organizer-specific gene is foxa <dig>  which is first expressed in the mouse embryo at e <dig>  in the ego and the anterior ve  <cit> . as gastrulation proceeds, foxa <dig> is expressed in the later organizer populations  and organizer derivatives , notochord, de and floor plate). foxa <dig> is absolutely required in these tissues, as they do not form in the foxa <dig> null embryo  <cit> . foxa <dig> null embryos die between e <dig>  and e <dig>  due to embryonic patterning defects of the primary body axes. foxa <dig> has an additional function in the ve for proper elongation of the ps, a function that can be rescued in a foxa <dig> mutant embryo by restoration of wild-type ve  <cit> . as an indication of its conserved importance among vertebrates, foxa <dig> has organizer-specific homologues in zebrafish  <cit> , xenopus  <cit> , and chicken  <cit> . despite its conserved and important functions, the only defined targets of foxa <dig> in the early embryo are shh  <cit>  and otx <dig>  <cit> , leaving many open questions regarding the downstream targets of foxa <dig> in vertebrate development. furthermore, the lack of markers for organizer derivatives, particularly the de, is a major obstacle in our understanding of the molecular pathways that underlie differentiation of distinct lineages in the early embryo  <cit> . this is of particular significance when attempting to coax embryonic stem  cells into specific cell types for therapeutic applications  <cit> .

a number of groups have designed screens to identify regionally specific transcripts within the mouse gastrula embryo, as well as novel molecular markers of node, ame, and de  <cit> . transcriptional profiling of the embryo has been done using subtractive cdna libraries, serial analysis of gene expression , and microarrays. these techniques, in conjunction with micro-dissection, flow cytometry, and wild-type versus mutant comparison, have highlighted the molecular differences between tissues and cell types in the gastrula. although these screens were highly productive, they by no means reached saturation and each study contributed its own set of novel markers depending on the design and limitations of each approach. this suggested to us that there were still many more genes to be identified in the tissues derived from the mouse gastrula organizer.

in this study, we present a functionally based microarray screen to identify novel molecular markers of the node, ame, and de. we compared total rna from pools of wild-type and foxa <dig> mutant embryos at e <dig> . we could detect genes whose levels were significantly reduced in foxa <dig> mutant embryos due to the absence of organizer-derived tissues. the genes we detected represent putative targets of foxa <dig> or indirect targets due to the absence of organizer tissue. based on the microarray results, we conducted whole mount in situ hybridization screens to identify novel gene expression patterns. finally, we placed our results in the context of a gene regulatory network of organizer development.

RESULTS
microarray analysis
to identify novel genes implicated in organizer and endoderm formation, we performed a differential gene expression comparison of wild-type and foxa <dig> null embryos at e <dig> . foxa <dig> null embryos were derived from foxa <dig> null es cells  <cit>  using the tetraploid complementation technique  <cit> . briefly, this technique involves aggregating es cells  with wild-type tetraploid host embryos , culturing the chimeric embryos to blastocyst stage, then transferring back to pseudo-pregnant recipient mothers . in these experiments, the es cells contribute to the epiblast and the tetraploid host will contribute to the extra-embryonic tissues, including the ve. the embryos are then dissected at e <dig>  and screened for gfp- es cell contribution to the epiblast. in our experiments, this technique has the advantage of rescuing the function of foxa <dig> in the ve, allowing proper elongation of the ps, and analysis of foxa <dig> function exclusively in the embryo proper  <cit> . the technique also allowed us to rapidly collect litters of entirely homozygous null embryos . furthermore, total rna could be isolated without the need for amplification before hybridization to affymetrix genechip microarrays. we initially used the u74av <dig> array platform , and then to expand the scope of our study, we re-hybridized the same biological samples to the whole genome moe430v <dig> array platform  when it became available. we performed the array experiments on two biological replicate pools each of foxa <dig> null and wild-type epiblasts. we also collected a third biological replicate pool of foxa <dig> mutant and wild-type embryos that we could use for independent quantitative validation of gene expression level changes .

after normalization and filtering of the u74av <dig> microarray data, we scored probe sets as consistently reduced in foxa <dig> null embryos compared to wild-type, if they had a significant change in two out of four cross comparisons . we hypothesized that these genes would represent direct or indirect targets of foxa <dig>  due to loss of activation by foxa <dig> or loss of organizer-derived tissues, respectively. our foxa <dig> mutant microarrays also detected many up-regulated genes , which could represent putative target genes repressed by foxa <dig>  there is evidence that foxa <dig> acts as a repressor  <cit> , however in our experiments these results are confounded and would be difficult to analyze. this is because a foxa <dig> mutant epiblast derived by tetraploid complementation does not displace its wild-type ve, and when compared to a wild-type epiblast that does displace its ve, the mutant appears to be highly enriched for ve markers ; this makes it impossible to distinguish between genuine up-regulated genes, and genes up-regulated due to ve enrichment. accordingly, we focused on the genes with reduced levels in foxa <dig> mutant embryos, and could identify a number of known markers of the node, ame and de . a number of these known markers were also previously validated in the literature as being reduced or absent in foxa <dig> null embryos .

we found foxa <dig> transcript, another forkhead transcription factor that follows foxa <dig> expression in the ame and de  <cit> , was reduced in the foxa <dig> null embryo. this is consistent with previous data that showed foxa <dig> is reduced in both foxa <dig> null embryos  <cit>  and embyroid bodies  derived from foxa <dig> null es cells  <cit> . we also found reduction of brachyury  levels, which is expressed in the ps, node and ame at e <dig>   <cit> . this is consistent with loss of brachyury expression specifically in the node and ame, but not ps, of tetraploid-derived foxa <dig> null embryos at e <dig>   <cit> . one of the most highly down-regulated genes in the foxa <dig> null data set was foxd <dig> . foxd <dig> expression is completely lost in the axial midline of foxa <dig> null embryos at e <dig>  and is also slightly reduced in the anterior neuroectoderm   <cit> . we confirmed that expression of foxd <dig> in the node and ame at e <dig>  was absent in foxa <dig> null embryos . in addition to known markers of the node and ame, we also found de markers sox <dig>  <cit> , trh  <cit>  and cer <dig>  <cit>  were reduced in foxa <dig> null embryos, consistent with previous data that showed loss of foxa <dig> in the epiblast leads to reduction of cer <dig>  <cit> . finally, we also detected reduction in genes strongly expressed in the de as well as in other germ layers, such as arg <dig> and cdx <dig>  <cit> .

to provide further validation of the microarray results, we performed quantitative real-time pcr  on third biological replicate pools of wild-type and foxa <dig> mutant embryos. we confirmed that the known node, ame and de markers described above  had reduced levels in the foxa <dig> mutant embryo.

reduction of these known markers provided evidence that our microarray-based screen could detect changes in transcripts specific to organizer-derived tissues at e <dig> .

whole mount in situ hybridization screening: phase i
based on the presence of known node, ame or de markers among the most highly down-regulated genes in the foxa <dig> null embryo , we selected further genes for expression analysis by whole mount in situ hybridization. in the first phase of our screen, we analyzed genes based on the criteria that they were significantly reduced in the foxa <dig> null embryo  and did not have previously published expression patterns as early as e <dig>  . after completing the first round of screening, we found the frequency of novel, regionally specific patterns was 13% , which was on par with previous gene expression screens at the same stage of embryonic mouse development . the frequency of regionally specific genes with a ≥  <dig>  fold decrease in the foxa <dig> null mutant more than doubles if the known  and novel  expression patterns in the data set are considered together .

in this initial phase of the screen we found three genes with novel expression domains in the node and/or ame: gal , pim <dig> , and prnp . gal  encodes a peptide hormone that controls various biological activities  <cit> , and is expressed in the node, ame, and ps at e <dig>  . we confirmed that gal was completely absent in foxa <dig> mutant embryos . gal has an intriguing expression pattern in the ps, which is first observed in the most posterior and medial region of the streak before it bifurcates, and is then expressed more laterally in the posterior mesoderm . at e <dig>  gal is weakly expressed in the heart and posterior notochord . pim <dig>  is a serine/threonine kinase  <cit> , and is expressed in the node and ps at e <dig>  , after which its expression becomes widespread at e <dig>  . we found prnp, the gene that encodes prion protein, is expressed specifically in the node at e <dig>  . this was much earlier in development than was previously reported, which described initial onset in the mouse embryo at e <dig>   <cit> . third replicate pool validation of gal and prnp levels using q-pcr confirmed their reduction in foxa <dig> null embryos . we also identified genes that, although widespread at e <dig> , had an obvious and strong expression domain in the node .

the two novel de expression patterns that were revealed in the first phase of the screen were cldn <dig> and itga <dig>  cldn <dig>  encodes a tight junction protein that is expressed in the anterior de and extra-embryonic regions at e <dig> , then in lateral de and the foregut pocket at e <dig>  . cldn <dig> is restricted to the gut endoderm and otic vesicle from e <dig> – <dig>  . reduction of cldn <dig> has been observed in whole mount foxa <dig> null embryos . a large-scale embryonic gene expression screen previously identified cldn <dig> and cldn <dig> as regionally restricted genes, but only cldn <dig> was described and shown at e <dig>  as being expressed in the endoderm and otic vesicle  <cit> . cldn <dig> was also one of two de genes identified in a subtractive cdna screen at e <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, cldn <dig> was identified in a sage-based screen to identify genes enriched in the de  <cit> . this raises the possibility that at least part of the large claudin gene family may have important and therefore redundant functions in the endoderm. itga <dig>  is strongly expressed in a lateral region of the de at e <dig>  . itga <dig> is expressed throughout the notochord and gut endoderm at e <dig>  . we confirmed itga <dig> was reduced in foxa <dig> null embryos . interestingly, one of the four mutants examined still expressed some itga <dig> in a small patch at the anterior primitive streak . this is consistent with previous results that showed endoderm-like cells form in tetraploid chimeric foxa <dig> mutant embryos, which accumulate in the aps region due to failure of epithelialization . reduction of cldn <dig> and itga <dig> levels in foxa <dig> mutant embryos was confirmed using q-pcr . we also found a number of genes that had weak to no staining at e <dig> , but that showed endoderm expression at e <dig>  ; because the e <dig>  microarray screen detected these genes as being significantly reduced, we took this to mean the in situ hybridization lacked sufficient sensitivity at this earlier stage.

although the first phase of our screen identified a number of genes with expression specifically in the node at e <dig> , we wondered if our ability to detect reduction in node-specific transcripts was at the limit of the microarray's sensitivity. we considered this because the node is a very small tissue at e <dig>  , and therefore must contribute only a tiny fraction of the total embryonic rna at this stage. given that node-specific genes could be present in the group of down-regulated genes with a less than  <dig>  fold change in the foxa <dig> mutant, we decided to examine a number of genes that fell below this threshold. we screened  <dig> genes that fell below the threshold, and found one additional gene expressed in the endoderm , and three expressed in the node at e <dig> ; these were cyb <dig> , smoc <dig> , and gstm <dig> . the frequency of regionally specific transcripts we found in this set was slightly lower than the first phase of the screen . together these results suggested that our screening threshold was appropriately set for larger tissues in the gastrula embryo, such as the ame and de, but that very small tissues, such as the node, were near the limit of detection in our experimental design.

whole mount in situ hybridization screening: phase ii
to expand on the screen performed using the u74av <dig> arrays, we rehybridized the same biological samples to the upgraded whole genome moe430v <dig> arrays. the newer arrays had much greater coverage of the mouse transcriptome, however the probe sets were also completely redesigned, so we could not directly compare overlapping data from the two platforms. we did find that the moe430v <dig> arrays measured the same reduction in known node, ame and de markers as the u74av <dig> arrays . the moe430v <dig> arrays also demonstrated greater sensitivity in detecting reduction in known node, ame and de markers represented on both old and new versions of the genechip . furthermore, changes were detected in known node, ame and de markers not represented on the older version of the array , demonstrating the increased potential to identify novel genes in our tissues of interest.

for the second phase of our screen, we analyzed genes detected by the moe430v <dig> arrays as, 1) being significantly reduced in the foxa <dig> mutant embryo , 2) not included in the first phase of our screen, and 3) having a potential functional role in embryogenesis based on the available annotation. we screened an additional  <dig> genes at e <dig>   and found  <dig>  had regionally specific expression patterns, consistent with the first phase of the screen . of these genes, four genes were expressed in the node: 1700027a23rik ; mlf <dig> ; 1700009p17rik ; and josd <dig> . we also found three additional markers of the de: cpm , which is expressed in the anterior de at e <dig>  , throughout the de and strongly in the foregut pocket at e <dig>  , and then mostly in the ventral aspect of the presumptive gut at e <dig>  ; ppp1r14a  subunit 14a), which is also expressed strongly in the ventral region of the gut at e <dig>  ; and efhd <dig> , which is expressed strongly in the most rostral foregut and caudal hindgut at e <dig>  . by using an extended array platform to measure transcripts reduced in the foxa <dig> mutant embryo, we increased the depth of our screen and found seven additional genes with novel expression domains in the node or de.

in total, we screened  <dig> unique transcripts reduced in the foxa <dig> mutant embryo. we found  <dig> novel expression domains in the node and  <dig> in the de. these genes are expressed in regions of high foxa <dig> activity and are therefore potential targets of foxa <dig>  furthermore, novel node and endoderm genes are candidates for embryo patterning and notochord formation, and novel de genes could have an additional role in organogenesis of the gut and its associated organs. further studies will elucidate the functional roles of these genes, and whether or not they are directly downstream of foxa <dig> 

secondary phenotypes caused by the loss of organizer derivates
during our screen we found a large number of both known and novel regionally specific genes expressed outside the primary tissues affected in the foxa <dig> mutant embryo. for example, based on the results of the u74av <dig> array and first phase screen, we found genes expressed in the ps, ane, cardiac mesoderm, and vasculature . the foxa <dig> mutant chimeras we derived for this study using tetraploid complementation have wild-type rescued ve, which allows, an albeit smaller, ps to elongate  <cit> . however the aps, which is comprised of organizer tissue and gives rise to ame  <cit> , does not form in these mutants. given the important inductive role of the organizer in patterning the gastrula embryo , it is not surprising that we would detect molecular defects within the streak. in fact, 14% of the genes in the first phase of the screen were expressed in the ps . using q-pcr, we confirmed that a number of these ps markers were in fact reduced in the foxa <dig> mutant at e <dig>  . this led us to conclude that our screen not only detected genes specific to the primary tissues absent in foxa <dig> mutant embryos, but also found genes in secondary tissues affected by loss of interaction with organizer derivatives.

the ingressing mesoderm of the ps is not only an important signaling centre for the posterior of the embryo, but is also the site of mesodermal lineage specification. for example, endothelial precursors of the vasculature and cardiac mesoderm both originate within the ps  <cit> . we detected a number of early markers of the embryonic vasculature including tie <dig>  <cit>  and flt <dig>  <cit> . we went on to confirm that flt <dig> was expressed at e <dig>  , earlier than was previously reported at e <dig>   <cit> , and is reduced in foxa <dig> mutants by q-pcr . the cells that will make up the embryonic vasculature originate in the ps, and our data suggests that this early specification step is at least partially dependent on signals from organizer tissues.

the anterior endoderm and cardiac mesoderm develop in close proximity to each other, both at early stages of lineage specification and determination, as well as later during organogenesis . extensive work in frog and chick embryos has explored the inductive interactions between these two tissues, although it is less clear how these mechanisms translate in the mouse embryo . there is some evidence that the anterior ve has a role in patterning cardiac precursors in the mouse  <cit> . in e <dig>  foxa <dig> mutant embryos derived by the same method used in this study , loss of the ame and de does not severely affect patterning of the anterior heart field, based on the result that heart markers nppa and wnt <dig> are not greatly reduced  <cit> . however, von both and colleagues also showed that the heart marker smpx was partially reduced, raising the possibility that there is a subset of cardiac markers that are affected in these foxa <dig> mutant chimeras. consistent with this possibility, the first phase of our screen identified  <dig> markers of cardiac mesoderm as reduced in the foxa <dig> mutant at e <dig>  . we went on to validate reduction of tnnt <dig> in the foxa <dig> mutant pool using q-pcr . this subset of cardiac markers suggests there are some genes expressed in the anterior heart field that are more dependent on interaction with de versus ve, although further analysis will be required to understand these differential inductive roles.

the ane, or presumptive forebrain, is highly dependent on inductive interactions with the anterior mesendoderm, definitive and visceral endoderm during gastrulation . foxa <dig> has an important role in regulating downstream genes in the anterior ve, and therefore maintenance of the underlying ane  <cit> . however, anterior organizer derivatives in the embryo proper also play a critical role in forebrain patterning events. when the ame is genetically compromised, either by loss of bmp antagonists chordin and noggin  <cit>  or by attenuation of nodal signal  <cit> , severe defects in forebrain patterning result. a chimeric embryo without hhex  in the embryo proper results in loss of de, and subsequently drastic forebrain truncation  <cit> , further highlighting the importance of organizer derivatives in anterior patterning. conditional inactivation of foxa <dig> strictly in the epiblast, which leads to a phenotype similar to the foxa <dig> tetraploid chimeras used in this study, also demonstrated that loss of organizer derivatives leads to reduction of ane markers six <dig>  hesx <dig>  foxg <dig> , and fgf <dig>  <cit> . we detected reduction of ane markers six <dig> and hesx <dig> by microarray in the foxa <dig> mutant pool, and using q-pcr further validated strong reduction of hesx <dig> . we also confirmed foxd <dig> is reduced in the ane of foxa <dig> mutants at e <dig>  , as was previously shown at e <dig>   <cit> . together these results strengthen the model that tissue interaction within the anterior of the embryo proper is required for patterning of the forebrain, although the distinct contributions of the ame and de will need to be investigated further.

we propose that the tetraploid foxa <dig> mutant chimera will provide an important model for further studies on the interactions between organizer derivates and surrounding tissues in the gastrula embryo, and we are currently investigating the inductive effect of endoderm on heart mesoderm.

enrichment of gene ontology  terms among genes reduced in foxa <dig> mutants
as a first step towards understanding the functional relationships between genes that are differentially regulated in foxa <dig> mutant embryos, we looked for enrichment of specific go terms. we grouped genes as being expressed in the primary tissues affected in foxa <dig> mutants , which are also regions of high foxa <dig> activity, and in the secondary tissues affected but where foxa <dig> is not expressed, as described above . we found genes grouped into primary and secondary foxa <dig> mutant tissues had statistically significant go terms . go terms such as "transcription factor activity" and "anterior/posterior pattern formation" were present in both groups , and we took this to support the foxa <dig> mutant phenotype having specific patterning defects due to the loss of organizer and its derivatives, and subsequent loss of interactions with surrounding tissues. as expected, within regions of high foxa <dig> activity we found significant go terms such as, "morphogenesis of an epithelium", "gastrulation", and "notochord development" . furthermore, among genes specific to secondary tissues we found go terms such as, "cardiac muscle morphogenesis" and "forebrain development" . most importantly, the transcription factors we identified as being reduced in organizer derivatives may form the basis of a foxa2-dependent gene regulatory network.

prediction of putative foxa <dig> target genes
one of the difficulties of using the foxa <dig> mutant embryo to identify genuine foxa <dig> targets is the complete loss of organizer-derived tissues. this makes it difficult to distinguish between 1) genes reduced due to the absence of tissue, versus, 2) genes reduced due to the absence of their upstream activator. to begin classifying genes into these two distinct categories, and as a way to predict putative foxa <dig> target genes, we used two independent methods to find conserved foxa <dig> binding motifs.

we searched for foxa <dig> binding motifs around all genes reduced in foxa <dig> mutants and expressed in regions of foxa <dig> activity . the first algorithm utilizes a precomputed database of known binding motifs found within conserved regions of mouse and human promoters . we found  <dig> out of  <dig> genes searched had conserved foxa <dig> binding motifs within a  <dig> kb upstream and  <dig> kb downstream region around the transcriptional start site . these represent strong candidates for foxa <dig> target genes, and include both known and novel genes we identified as expressed in the node, ame and/or de. importantly, we found foxa <dig> itself among this set of genes, consistent with studies in human hepatocytes that demonstrated foxa <dig> binds its own promoter for autoregulation  <cit> . to focus more specifically on the gene regulatory program within the axial mesoderm, we also found conserved brachyury/t binding motifs in a smaller subset of the above co-expressed genes . surprisingly, one of these genes was cer <dig>  a gene expressed exclusively in the endoderm during gastrulation, suggesting brachyury/t could have a role in repressing endoderm genes within the mesoderm.

the second algorithm we used searches the entire genome for conserved regions that contain combinations of at least two dna binding motifs ; in this case foxa <dig> and brachyury/t. the advantage of this approach is that it is not limited to a specific set of genes, or the relatively small genomic regions around genes' transcriptional start sites. we identified two of the same four genes as above  as potential targets of foxa <dig> and brachyury/t . the two methods we applied  use different position weight matrix databases , which may explain why the predicted dna binding motifs found by the two programs do not overlap. we combined our validated foxa <dig> mutant microarray data, predictions of conserved foxa <dig> and brachyury/t binding motifs, as well as existing genetic data, to build a gene regulatory network model in the organizer and its derivates , the details of which will be outlined in the following discussion.

discussion
microarray analysis of foxa <dig> mutant gastrula embryos
functionally based expression profiling of the early mouse embryo is emerging as a powerful method to elucidate the regulatory networks that underlie developmental programs. comparison of the transcriptional profile between wild-type and mutant embryos has been done using subtractive cdna libraries  <cit> , and more recently using microarrays; for example, to study wnt signaling during gastrulation using conditional β-catenin mutants  <cit> , the pharyngeal region of tbx <dig> mutants  <cit> , and the mid-hindbrain organizer region in pax <dig> mutants  <cit> . we have used microarrays for expression profiling of wild-type and foxa <dig> mutant embryos at e <dig> , which fail to form organizer-derived tissues, including the node, ame, and de. we were able to identify both known and novel markers that were specific to these tissues, based on their reduction or absence in the foxa <dig> mutant.

whole mount in situ expression screening
we found known markers of the node, ame, and de had a ≥  <dig>  fold decrease in the foxa <dig> mutant, and this enabled us to set a threshold for the first phase of the whole mount in situ hybridization screen . we then examined a number of genes that fell below this threshold to evaluate the sensitivity of our experimental design . we found that genes expressed in the node, because it is a small tissue and represents a small fraction of the total rna, were difficult to detect by differential expression levels. finally, we rehybridized our original biological samples to an updated microarray to expand the depth of our screen, and chose additional transcripts for analysis . this second phase of our whole mount in situ hybridization screen more than doubled our total coverage of unique genes . from the combination of these various approaches, we found  <dig> novel expression patterns in the node and  <dig> in the de.

highly dynamic regional expression patterns within the developing primitive gut
before this and other recent screens in the early mouse embryo  <cit> , there were very few markers available that were specific to the definitive endoderm. two of these screens extended their design to isolate regionally specific transcripts along the anterior-posterior axis of the gut  <cit> . together, all of these markers will be critical for understanding the regional patterning of the gut during development, as well as for in vitro differentiation of es cells into endoderm lineages for therapeutic use. significant recent progress has also been made in understanding the fate map of gastrulation stage de and how it gives rise to later regions of the gut endoderm  <cit> . from this data a highly dynamic model of endoderm formation is emerging.

the next challenge will be to understand the different spatial and temporal requirements of this myriad of endoderm genes. for example, there are endoderm genes that are only expressed at early stages of endoderm development , and those that are uniformly expressed early on and then become highly regionalized . we have identified genes that later at e <dig>  are restricted to the midgut and hindgut , as have others previously , highlighting anterior-posterior differences in the developing gut tube. furthermore, the dorsal-ventral aspect of the primitive gut also has differential gene expression, as shown by the ventrally enriched genes we and others have identified . finally, we have also identified genes that appear to be expressed throughout many regions and stages of de development , which are structurally important for the development of the gut epithelium. a major outstanding question is whether or not these early regional expression patterns in the endoderm are predictive of later pattern in the gut and its associated organs.

loss of organizer induction in the foxa <dig> mutant embryo
our microarray analysis of foxa <dig> mutant embryos derived by tetraploid aggregation represents a complete molecular profile of a gastrula embryo that has developed with all tissues intact, except the organizer and its derivatives. the functional nature of this screen has allowed us to detect not only primary organizer specific genes , but also the secondary reduction of tissues that rely on interaction with the organizer . importantly, all of these secondary tissues still form in the foxa <dig> mutant, so it is not their specification that is compromised. in fact, the first studies that either genetically or physically ablated the organizer in the mouse were surprising because of how well the embryo was still patterned  <cit> . significantly, there appear to be subsets of genes within these secondary tissues that are more reliant on organizer interactions than others; for example, we observed reduction in various cardiac mesoderm markers, whereas others have shown that there are other cardiac markers that are not reduced in these mutants  <cit> . this is suggestive of genetic programs that are more dependent on either a regulative or determinative mode of development. the analysis of the foxa <dig> mutant we present here may point to a future direction in organizer research – the molecular basis of how the organizer functions to subtly refine its adjacent tissues.

building a network of foxa2-dependent gene regulation in organizer derivatives
although our understanding of the gene regulatory networks involved in vertebrate development is at an early stage, significant progress has been made in sea urchin  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , and ascidian embryos  <cit> . these invertebrate models provide an invaluable framework for predicting how more complex organisms must also organize genetic networks. our interest is focused on specification of cell lineages that originate in the mouse gastrula organizer, and in particular how foxa <dig> functions as a regulator within these tissues. foxa <dig> is expressed early in the organizer and then throughout its development, as this population gives rise to axial mesoderm , de , and ventral neuroectoderm   <cit> . this raises the interesting question of how foxa <dig> maintains regulation in distinct but closely associated lineages that segregate during gastrulation. to begin addressing this complex problem, we have built a putative gene regulatory network based on potential foxa <dig> target genes  that can be used as a testable model in future studies.

studies in sea urchin embryos have shown that gene regulatory networks specify cell lineages in a number of ways  <cit> , which include: 1) a means for initial acquisition of identity, 2) feedback loops to stabilize a regulatory state, 3) exclusion of alternate states, 4) production of a signal that is required for itself and adjacent cells, and 5) lineage-specific activation of genes. we present our network model with these concepts in mind.

a delicate balance between wnt and nodal pathways is required for the establishment and function of the vertebrate organizer . there is evidence that the wnt/β-catenin pathway indirectly regulates foxa <dig> through tead proteins that bind a node-specific foxa <dig> upstream enhancer  <cit> . previous genetic studies have shown that nodal signal, mediated in the nucleus through a foxh1-smad complex, is also upstream of foxa <dig> in organizer lineages  <cit> . our microarray results confirm this, as foxh <dig> levels are not changed in foxa <dig> mutants; a result that was further validated using q-pcr . conversely, we also validated that foxa <dig> levels are reduced in foxh <dig> mutants at e <dig>  . nodal-foxh1-smad is likely one of the mechanisms that organizer cells use to interpret their environmental cues for initial acquisition of identity.

once an initial identity has been established in a cell lineage it must be stabilized. one mechanism for this is a positive feedback loop involving transcriptional regulators that reinforce each other's expression  <cit> . we found evidence for this using foxa <dig> and brachyury/t binding motif predictions; brachyury/t may be regulated by foxa <dig>  and foxa <dig> may be regulated by itself and brachyury/t . consistent with this idea, we have previously found that foxa <dig> is expressed in ame precursors in the epiblast, which upregulate brachyury/t protein after epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition . this ame population stays positive for foxa <dig> and brachyury/t protein during the development of the axial mesoderm and anterior endoderm populations. also, foxa <dig> and brachyury/t likely regulate foxa <dig>  another axial mesendoderm transcription factor. the presence of all three factors in a cell's nucleus would help "lock in" this particular fate. furthermore, foxa <dig> genetically interacts with a number of other transcription factors  and further investigation may reveal that feedback loops work to reinforce cell fates in these contexts as well.

another important step in specifying a given lineage is the exclusion of alternate cell fates. for example, the homeodomain transcription factor noto is critical for promoting axial mesoderm fate  and repressing paraxial mesoderm fate   <cit> . also, β-catenin has a role in promoting axial mesendoderm towards an endoderm fate, while repressing mesoderm fate  <cit> . synergism between foxa <dig> and brachyury/t has been demonstrated in both ascidian and xenopus for promotion of notochord fate  <cit> , yet surprisingly we found conserved foxa <dig> and brachyury/t binding motifs associated with the endoderm gene cer <dig> . as brachyury/t is not expressed in the endoderm, it would suggest that brachyury/t might actively repress endoderm fate within the axial mesoderm. studies in ascidian embryos have shown that the converse is true; that brachyury/t is repressed in endoderm lineages , which has the effect of inhibiting notochord fate  <cit> . there is evidence that foxa <dig> can function as a repressor  <cit> , so it is possible that foxa <dig> may also work to exclude alternate fates. it will be interesting to explore further how foxa <dig> and brachyury/t interact with each other and their downstream targets, both positively and negatively, to sort out the multiple lineages that are produced during gastrulation.

a given cell lineage in the developing embryo does not develop in isolation, and proper specification usually involves production of a signal for maintenance of itself and patterning of adjacent tissues  <cit> . in the notochord, shh is the most likely candidate for this lineage-specific signal. it is thought to have an autocrine function, in that the notochord is formed but not maintained in its absence, as well as a paracrine function, as it is necessary and sufficient for patterning of the adjacent ventral neural tube  <cit> . foxa <dig> is a key regulator of shh in both the notochord and the floor plate  <cit> , connecting the production of a notochord-specific signal with our emerging foxa2-dependent gene regulatory network.

the culmination of lineage specification is the activation of a host of genes that enable cells to perform their designated function. the notochord's two primary functions during embryogenesis are signaling and structural , which in the mouse embryo can be broadly assigned to earlier and later stages, respectively. our foxa <dig> mutant screen was performed at e <dig> , which we expect is too early to detect disruption of the structural genes expressed later in differentiation of mature notochord. our binding motif predictions identified novel node genes mlf <dig>  pim <dig>  and smoc <dig> as potential downstream targets of foxa <dig> in the notochord, as well as cer <dig> in the endoderm . we could detect reduced shh levels, and therefore one of the direct signaling targets of foxa <dig>  however, because of the early stage of our screen, we would predict that detectable foxa <dig> targets would be in the top tier of the axial mesendoderm gene regulatory network, and few of the notochord differentiation genes would have been activated. this is supported by the identification of a number of other transcription factors among our group of putative foxa <dig> targets .

CONCLUSIONS
we have conducted functional microarray and expression pattern screens based on the foxa <dig> mutant embryo. these screens detected differentially regulated genes because of the absence of a critical transcription factor and phenotypic loss of organizer-derived tissues in the early embryo. these data have provided not only novel regionally specific gene expression patterns in the node, ame and de, but also putative downstream targets of foxa <dig> and potential new genes regulating organizer biology. this data has allowed us to build a model of the gene regulatory network involved in spemann/mangold organizer formation.

note added in proof

while this manuscript was in preparation, schweickert and colleagues identified galanin in a screen for asymmetrically expressed genes, based on its expression pattern in the heart. they also noted its expression in the node, notochord and ps between e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> .
