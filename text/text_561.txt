BACKGROUND
listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that can cause very serious food-borne infections in humans, with symptoms including meningitis, frequently accompanied by septicemia and meningoencephalitis, which are particularly severe for newborns and immunocompromised individuals  <cit> . the antibiotics of choice in the treatment of listeriosis are the β-lactams penicillin g or ampicillin, alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside  <cit> . the classical target enzymes for β-lactam antibiotics are the penicillin binding proteins . in l. monocytogenes, five pbps were initially identified using radiolabeled β-lactams  <cit> , and among these, pbp <dig> was thought to be the primary lethal target due to the observed low affinity of β-lactams for this protein and excellent correlation between the mics of different β-lactams and their affinity for this protein  <cit> . further evidence that pbp <dig> is the primary target for active β-lactams is that only this pbp appears to be identical in all listeria spp., and blockage of this protein has lethal consequences for the bacterial cell  <cit> .

recent in silico analysis of the l. monocytogenes egd genome revealed the presence of  <dig> genes encoding putative penicillin binding proteins and subsequently nine of these were positively verified as pbps by the binding of a fluorescent β-lactam derivative  <cit> . based on simple analysis of the predicted masses of these proteins, the gene likely to encode pbp <dig> was identified as lmo <dig>  <cit> . elegant studies by c. hill's group on the effect of mutations in  <dig> of the genes encoding pbps  on the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to β-lactams, revealed that lmo <dig> and lmo <dig>  contribute to the β-lactam resistance of l. monocytogenes, but inactivation of lmo <dig> did not result in obvious changes to either the sensitivity to β-lactams or the cell morphology  <cit> .

taking into account the seemingly contradictory nature of the aforementioned reports and the fact that the gene encoding pbp <dig> has yet to be directly identified, plus the absence of reports regarding the physiological function of this protein, our study focused on gene lmo <dig> . here we describe the use of the lactococcal nisin-controlled expression  system  <cit>  for the overexpression of this gene. this strategy was chosen because in a recently described analysis, mutational inactivation of lmo <dig> had no obvious physiological effect  <cit> . in the present study, it has been directly demonstrated that lmo <dig> encodes l. monocytogenes pbp <dig>  overexpression of this protein, which was accompanied by a slight increase in pbp <dig> expression, resulted in growth retardation, shortening of cells in the stationary phase of growth and minor changes in the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to β-lactams. the observed changes in cell morphology indicate the involvement of pbp <dig> in cell division. these novel data on the overexpression of gene lmo <dig> provide a more comprehensive view of the physiological function of pbp <dig> and its significance in the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to β-lactams. these findings also further our understanding of the mechanisms of l. monocytogenes susceptibility to β-lactams, which is of direct relevance to its antibiotic resistance, the use of antibiotic therapy to treat listeriosis, as well as the ability of this bacterium to form biofilms  <cit> .

RESULTS
construction of plasmid pakb carrying the nisin-controlled expression  system and its application in l. monocytogenes
given the contradictory reports on the significance of pbp <dig> in the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to β-lactam antibiotics, it was decided to study the effects of overexpression of l. monocytogenes gene lmo <dig>  the lactococcal nice system  <cit>  was chosen for overexpression studies since it has previously been successfully used in a number of gram-positive genera, including l. monocytogenes  <cit> . this system consists of a two-component signal transduction system nisrk, which senses the presence of nisin and induces transcription from the promoter pnis. recently developed strategies for using the nice system either place the nisrk genes on the host chromosome, which allows the use of a single-plasmid system with a nisa promoter  <cit> , or place both nisrk and the nisa promoter on one plasmid  <cit> . the first strategy was successfully used in l. monocytogenes by cotter et al.  <cit> , but here, the second approach was chosen since it is easier to use this system in various l. monocytogenes strains without the need for additional genetic manipulations to introduce the nisrk genes into the chromosome of each strain. plasmid pakb, a derivative of plasmid pnz <dig> carrying the nisa promoter, was constructed for the planned overexpression experiments. to construct this plasmid, a cassette comprised of the nisrk genes cloned downstream of the l. monocytogenes hly promoter was introduced into pnz <dig> to ensure efficient expression of these genes in l. monocytogenes  <cit> . the lmo <dig> gene was then cloned downstream of the pnis promoter in pakb to produce plasmid pakb-lmo <dig> 

before starting the experiments on overexpression of the lmo <dig> gene, the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to nisin was examined, since nisin is an inducer of the nice system but it can affect or inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes when used at high concentrations. the level of nisin required to completely inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes egd and of l. monocytogenes carrying the pakb plasmid lacking an insert  was over ten times higher than the concentration used previously to induce the nice system in l. monocytogenes  <cit> . furthermore, growth curves were plotted for l. monocytogenes pakb grown in the presence of different concentrations of nisin as well as in the absence of this inducer to determine the concentration of nisin that has no effect on growth. these preliminary experiments showed that  <dig> μg/ml was the maximum concentration of nisin that did not cause any changes in the growth rate of the control strain. at higher nisin concentrations, including that used previously  to induce nice in l. monocytogenes  <cit> , a slight reduction in the growth rate of l. monocytogenes pakb was observed during the exponential phase, compared to growth in the absence of nisin. the differences between the optimal nisin concentrations for growth and induction determined here and those established by cotter et al.  <cit>  may be due to the differential susceptibility of the strains egd and lo <dig> to this peptide.

to confirm that nisin induced overexpression of the lmo <dig> gene in l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig>  the cell membrane proteins of this strain and the control strain were analyzed. sds-page of isolated membrane proteins revealed the presence of an additional protein in l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> grown in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml nisin . the estimated mass of this additional protein was approximately  <dig> kda, which corresponds to the predicted mass of lmo <dig> . the additional protein was detected at both  <dig> and  <dig> h following induction, but it was not observed when l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> was grown in the absence of nisin .

to examine whether higher levels of lmo <dig> production could be achieved by changing the conditions of nisin induction and/or culture growth, l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> was grown with increasing concentrations of nisin , and in medium supplemented with activated charcoal, which positively regulates the hly promoter driving the transcription of nisrk  <cit> . in spite of these changes in the induction conditions , no increase in the level of lmo <dig> production was observed. since an increase in nisin concentration above  <dig> μg/ml had no further effect on lmo <dig> production in l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig>  and this concentration did not affect the growth of control strain l. monocytogenes pakb, it was decided to use  <dig> μg/ml nisin in all subsequent physiological studies.

analysis of pbps of the l. monocytogenes strain overexpressing gene lmo1438
to determine whether lmo <dig> encodes pbp <dig>  membrane proteins of l. monocytogenes pakb and l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> were incubated with benzylpenicillin, then separated by sds-page followed by fluorography to detect the labeled pbps. this assay clearly demonstrated an increased level of pbp <dig> in l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> . densitometric analysis of pbps produced by both strains revealed that the amount of pbp <dig> in l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> was  <dig> -fold greater than in l. monocytogenes pakb . this result proved that l. monocytogenes gene lmo <dig> does indeed encode pbp <dig>  interestingly, l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> also showed a small but significant increase in the expression of pbp <dig> compared with l. monocytogenes pakb. this protein, encoded by gene lmo <dig>  was previously shown to have glycosyltransferase, transpeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities  <cit> . the expression of pbp <dig> is directly regulated by the hpk1021-rrp <dig> two-component system  <cit> , which in turn is subject to regulation by the lisrk two-component system  <cit> . both of these two-component systems play essential roles in regulating the structure of the l. monocytogenes cell envelope, but they are also involved in resistance to nisin, so it was unclear whether the elevated level of pbp <dig> observed in l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> was the consequence of nisin use or an effect of pbp <dig> overexpression. therefore, an analysis of pbp proteins isolated from l. monocytogenes pakb cultured with and without nisin was performed. this showed that the addition of nisin at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml had no effect on the production of pbps by the control strain . furthermore, the elevated level of pbp <dig> observed in the strain l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> compared with l. monocytogenes pakb, when both were cultured in the presence of nisin, indicated that this phenomenon is a consequence of pbp <dig> overexpression.

b values were normalized to the band intensity of pbp <dig> from l. monocytogenes pakb, which was assigned the value of  <dig> 

c indicates band with intensity significantly different  from the corresponding band of the control strain.

effect of pbp <dig> overproduction on growth and cell morphology of l. monocytogenes
since mutation of the lmo <dig> gene did not cause any changes in the growth and cell morphology of l. monocytogenes, the physiological role of pbp <dig> is unclear. to better understand the cellular function of pbp <dig>  the effect of increased production of this protein on the growth and morphology of l. monocytogenes was examined. the growth rate of the strain overproducing pbp <dig> was visibly retarded during the exponential phase of growth, when the doubling time of l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> was  <dig> min compared to  <dig> min for l. monocytogenes pakb. however, in the stationary phase of growth the culture of l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> reached a higher od <dig> value compared to the control strain, which correlated with a significantly higher number of viable bacteria in this phase of growth .

analysis of cell morphology by scanning electron microscopy revealed that l. monocytogenes pakb and l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> cells appeared similar in the exponential phase of growth and the length and diameter of cells of both strains did not differ statistically. however, an analysis of cell morphology of l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> and the control strain in the stationary phase of growth showed that the cells of both strains had the same diameter, but those of the former strain were significantly shorter . the reduced growth rate of l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> cannot solely be attributed to the overexpression of pbp <dig>  since an elevated level of pbp <dig> expression was also found in the recombinant strain, and disruption of the lmo <dig> gene indicates that pbp <dig> is essential for the growth of l. monocytogenes  <cit> . therefore, the observed growth retardation may be the result of the overexpression of pbp <dig>  pbp <dig> or of both these proteins. the clear reduction in the cell length of l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig>  with no change in cell diameter, suggests a role for pbp <dig> in cell division. current models of bacterial cell wall synthesis suggest that distinct wall-synthetic complexes act in an alternating fashion during the life cycle, to first drive cell elongation by the insertion of peptidoglycan into the cylindrical wall, followed by the switching of most wall-synthetic activity to septum production  <cit> . in e. coli, the genes required for septation have been identified and most are designated fts , of which ftsi  is a major protein of the cell division complex or divisome  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis of the l. monocytogenes pbp <dig> showed that this protein could potentially act as an ftsi cell division transpeptidase  <cit> . we hypothesize that an excess of pbp <dig> disturbs the balance between the activities of the cell elongation and cell division complexes, and the majority of peptidoglycan synthesis might be carried out by the septum synthetic machinery. this would explain the production of shorter cells by l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig>  we assume that the formation of short cells is triggered by pbp <dig> overexpression, rather than increased pbp <dig> abundance, since transglycosylases are part of the general peptidoglycan synthetic machinery and are not specific for cell division. however, a number of less specialized enzymes are also required for lateral expansion  <cit> .

the postulated participation of pbp <dig> in cell division is evidently limited to the stationary phase of growth which may result from the presence of a second protein with ftsi activity in l. monocytogenes. indeed, lmo <dig> is also a potential ftsi cell division transpeptidase and it is suggested that the lmo <dig> mutation is lethal for l. monocytogenes  <cit> . it seems therefore, that lmo <dig> is the main protein involved in division of l. monocytogenes. the influence of pbp <dig> on cell morphology is manifested in the stationary phase cells, which suggests that this protein may play a unique role during this phase of growth. this hypothesis is supported by the unchanged cell morphology of l. monocytogenes in the exponential phase of growth, both in the absence of pbp <dig>  <cit>  and when this protein is overexpressed.

effect of overexpression of pbp <dig> on the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to β-lactams
to determine whether pbp <dig> plays a role in β-lactam resistance, l. monocytogenes pakb and l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> were tested for their susceptibility to penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams and carbapenems using an antibiotic disk sensitivity assay. this preliminary assay did not reveal any significant changes in the sensitivity to β-lactams caused by the overproduction of pbp <dig> - the diameters of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition surrounding the filter disks were identical after  <dig> h incubation. however, after  <dig> h incubation, partial autolysis of the bacterial growth in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxicillin, mezlocillin and imipenem was observed . penicillin g, ampicillin and amoxicillin were then chosen for mic determination using the e-test. this assay confirmed the results of the antibiotic disk tests, namely that both strains were equally susceptible to the β-lactams tested and that in the case of the strain overexpressing pbp <dig>  a zone of partial autolysis of the bacterial lawn was observed at an antibiotic concentration three to four times lower than the mic. the results for ampicillin are presented in figure 4a. a survival assay was also performed for l. monocytogenes pakb and l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> by culturing these strains in broth supplemented with a lethal dose of penicillin g. the optical density of the l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> culture decreased at a faster rate than that of the control strain, which correlated with the more rapid elimination of viable bacteria from the culture . keeping in mind that in the constructed strain an increased level of pbp <dig> expression was also observed, which was found to contribute to the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to β-lactams  <cit> , the changes in the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes pakb-lmo <dig> to β-lactam antibiotics may be not only an effect of pbp <dig> overexpression. thus, it seems probable that the altered susceptibility of this strain to β-lactams is the effect of overexpression of pbp <dig>  pbp <dig> or both of these proteins. regardless of the reason for the altered susceptibility, it may definitely be concluded that overexpression of pbp <dig>  leads to minor changes in the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to β-lactams without any change in the mic values. together with the lack of changes in β-lactam mic values in the case of the lmo <dig> mutant strain reported by guinane et al.  <cit> , this result demonstrates that the role of pbp <dig> is non-essential in the β-lactam resistance of l. monocytogenes. these findings concerning the β-lactam antibiotic resistance of l. monocytogenes are important with regard to the treatment of listeriosis and the ability of this bacterium to form biofilms  <cit> . the latter complex issue has recently been reviewed by renier et al.  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of the present study have helped to elucidate the somewhat conflicting results regarding the contribution of pbp <dig> to the β-lactam susceptibility of l. monocytogenes. using the nice expression system, it has been directly shown that pbp <dig> is encoded by the lmo <dig> gene. despite the excellent correlation between the mics of different β-lactams and their affinity for pbp <dig>  <cit> , neither the absence  <cit>  nor an excess of this protein affects the susceptibility of l. monocytogenes to β-lactams, and so it is not the primary lethal target of these antibiotics.

an interesting additional observation was that pbp <dig> overexpression is accompanied by increased expression of pbp <dig>  this finding indicates that the composition of the l. monocytogenes cell wall is subject to tight regulation, but it also makes it difficult to analyze the physiological role of pbp <dig> on the basis of overexpression studies, since the observed changes in growth rate and antibiotic sensitivity cannot be attributed to pbp <dig> overexpression alone. the overexpression of pbp <dig> induced the formation of short cells in the stationary phase of growth, which strongly suggests the involvement of pbp <dig> in cell division at this growth stage. it is possible that the changes in cell morphology produced by overexpression of pbp <dig> may be due to a putative ftsi activity, whereas the parallel increase in the expression of pbp <dig>  could play an auxiliary role in this process.

finally, in the course of clarifying the contribution of pbp <dig> to the β-lactam susceptibility of l. monocytogenes, a new vector was constructed that is suitable for the overexpression of genes of interest in l. monocytogenes. the placement of components of the nice system on a single plasmid provides an easy to use tool for expressing any protein of choice in l. monocytogenes. the construction of the plasmid pakb and its successful application in l. monocytogenes are important in view of the limited number of existing inducible gene expression systems for listeria spp.
