BACKGROUND
systemic sclerosis  is a disease whose extremely complex, multifaceted pathogenesis cannot be referred to a single hypothesis, even if fundamental abnormalities in three or more types of cells are involved: fibroblasts, endothelial cells and cells of the immune system, namely t and b lymphocytes  <cit> . mononuclear cells  in the ssc skin infiltrates produce cytokines and growth factors responsible for the onset and progression of fibrosis and microvascular damage. the role of this immune dysfunction is not fully clear. altered cellular immunity is revealed by aberrant t cell biology in both the skin, where the lesions display various features consistent with t cell activation  <cit> , and the circulation, where cd4+ t cells are increased  <cit> , and natural killer t cells are decreased  <cit> . lastly, circulating t cells from ssc patients produce more inflammatory mediators compared to those from healthy controls  <cit> .

an important role as controllers of self-reactivity  <cit>  has recently been defined for t regulatory cells  in autoimmune disease. these cells are defined as cd4+/cd25bright/foxp3+. in ssc, both an increase in their absolute number and a reduction of their function have been demonstrated  <cit> .

a high proportion of ssc patients suffer from raynaud's phenomenon. this is a vasospastic disorder that causes discoloration of the fingers, toes and occasionally other extremities, and its persistence may result in acral ulcer and significantly reduce the quality of life  <cit> . prostaglandin  analogues, particularly the pgi <dig> analogue iloprost, are widely used as vasodilators to treat this disorder  <cit> .

patients with ssc receiving iloprost report a reduction in skin tightness, suggesting that this drug inhibits skin fibrosis. it has been suggested that iloprost reduces skin fibrosis by reducing collagen synthesis  <cit> , the pro-fibrotic cytokine connective tissue growth factor  <cit>  and the fibrotic response  <cit> .

iloprost has since been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating actions, both in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . of the two studies in humans  <cit> , only filaci et al.  <cit>  evaluated the effect of iloprost in ssc. its potential in this disease is thus an open question.

here we demonstrate that iloprost decreases the production of tnf α by acting on t cells, ameliorates treg function, and increases il- <dig> 

methods
patients
the study was approved by the "clinical study review committee" of turin's "ordine mauriziano" hospital, and all the patients signed an informed consent statement prior to their recruitment.

fifteen women with ssc aged  <dig> ±  <dig>  were enrolled. none were taking corticosteroids, estrogen, or immunosuppressants, or had previously received iloprost. their ssc was classified as grade i accordng to medsger et al.  <cit>  and its mean duration was  <dig> ±  <dig> months. raynaud's phenomenon was always present. all the patients complained of side-effects, but continued the infusions and reached satisfactory drug levels. the mean quantity infused was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/kg/min for  <dig> hrs/day for  <dig> days. all the patients started a second iloprost course after  <dig> days.

treatment
iloprost was infused intravenously according to the standard protocol  <cit>  for  <dig> h/day for  <dig> consecutive days. the target dose was  <dig> ng/kg/min.

blood was drawn from an antecubital vein after an overnight fast of  <dig> or more hours at baseline, after the 5-day treatment, and then after a further  <dig> days to evaluate the timing of its action;  <dig> days were chosen since in clinical practice another course is started at the end of this period.

all measurements were performed from a single blood sample at a single time point per patient.

media, reagents, and chemicals
cells were maintained in rpmi  <dig>  supplemented with  <dig> mm l-glutamine 10% fetal bovine serum , benzyl penicillin  and streptomycin , phytohemoagglutinin  was added in the stimulated condition.

il- <dig> was purchased from r&d systems . iloprost .

cells
peripheral bood mononuclear cells  from ssc patients were obtained with the ficoll-paque method from  <dig> ml peripheral blood in lithium heparin at baseline, after  <dig> days iloprost infusion, and at  <dig> days after the last infusion. pbmc cultures were performed in triplicate for each subject in 96-well plates . for in vitro experiments pbmcs were obtained from buffy coats .

ab
fluorescein  conjugated anti-cd <dig>  phycoerythrin  conjugated anti-cd <dig> pe-conjugated anti-tnf α were purchased from biolegend .

peridinin chlorophyll protein  conjugated anti-cd <dig> was purchased from becton & dickinson 

t reg staining kit and apc-conjugated anti-cd <dig> were purchased from ebioscience .

flow cytometry
for intracellular staining, brefeldin  was added to the cells for  <dig> hr. cells were harvested, stained with surfaces antibodies, then permeabilized with saponin 5%  for  <dig> min washed and blocked for nonspecific binding sites using normal rat serum before the intracytoplasmic staining  was performed. all the experiments were performed with cells stained with specific isotype control.

flow cytometry was performed on a facscalibur flow cytometer .

cytokine measurement
serum il- <dig> , total rankl , tnf α  and tgf β <dig>  were measured by elisa. the levels of tnfα, free rankl, tgf β <dig> and infγ  were also measured in the supernatants from cultures stimulated or not with pha.

real time rt-pcr
total cellular rna was isolated using trizol reagent , chloroform extraction, and subsequent isopropanol precipitation according to the manufacturer's protocol.  <dig> μg of rna was converted up to single-stranded cdna by the high-capacity cdna reverse transcription kit . cdna was stored at -20°c until use. β-actin was the housekeeping control. rq-pcr analysis of rankl and tgfβ <dig> was performed by the icycler iq™ system . taqman probes were designed using primer express v <dig>  software and synthesized by applied biosystems . foxp <dig> expression was quantified by the syber green method. the following primers were used: rankl sense 5'-gccttttgctcatctcactattaatg-3' and antisense 5'-tggtaccaagaggacagactcactt-3'; tgf-b sense 5'- tttgatgtcaccggagttgtg-3' and antisense 5'- gcgaaagccctcaatttcc-3'; foxp <dig>  sense 5'-cagctgctcgcacagattactt-3' and antisense 5'-gggacaggattgtgacattttgt-3'.

statistics
the normal distribution of each parameter was determined with kurtosis' test: pbmc subsets, the cytokines  and genes measured were normally distributed. student's paired t test was used to compare gaussian variables at baseline and after iloprost . wilcoxon's test was used to compare non-gaussian variables at baseline and after iloprost .

the spss  <dig>  software package was used to process the data with p <  <dig>  as the significance cut-off

RESULTS
iloprost reduces t cell and tnf α production
involvement of iloprost in control of the immune response and inflammation has been suggested  <cit> , though there are no data indicative of this effect in ssc.

1a illustrates the significant reduction of t cells achieved after  <dig> days of lloprost, whereas monocytes are not affected. t cells returned to the baseline level  <dig> days after the last infusion. as tnf α is produced mainly by t cells and monocytes among pbmcs and it is increased in inflammation, we looked at the effect of iloprost on tnf α producing cells. figure 1b shows that tnf α producing t cells decreased after  <dig> days of iloprost and returned to baseline  <dig> days after the last infusion, whereas tnf α producing monocytes were not affected.

these findings could reflect diminished t cell activation, but evaluation of the early and late t cell activation markers cd <dig> and cd <dig> disclosed at non significant reduction of such activation .

to determine whether iloprost reduces t cells directly, we incubated pbmcs from buffy coats  with iloprost. figure 1c suggests that iloprost might reduce the number of t cells in vitro, even though the results are not statistically significant.

confirmation of iloprost's anti tnf α effect was sought by measuring tnf α levels in supernatants from pbmc cultures stimulated or not with pha. as expected, pha increased tnf α secretion. iloprost reduced this response and hence the production of tnf α , whereas it had no effect on tnf α in the unstimulated culture . we found no decrease in serum tnf α after iloprost . this datum points to the specific action of iloprost against t cells and its ability to reduce tnf α production in response to t cell stimulation.

iloprost reduces t regs in vivo and in vitro
since altered treg number and activity may be important in ssc  <cit> , we evaluated these cells as a possible iloprost target. we studied t cells by flow cytometry and confirmed our data by analysing foxp <dig> expression by real time rt-pcr. figure 3a &3b demonstrate a reduction of treg cells after  <dig> days of iloprost infusion.

tgf β <dig> is mainly produced by treg cells within pbmcs and it is a marker of their function  <cit> , we measured this cytokine in the pbmcs culture supernatants at baseline and after iloprost with and without immune stimulation. the data in figure 4a show a significant increase in tgf β <dig> in the pbmcs supernatants after stimulation with pha following iloprost, hence suggest that iloprost influences the response of treg cells to immune stimulation.

serum tgf β  <dig> is not influenced by iloprost : this datum points to a specific action of iloprost against t cells producing tgf β <dig>  the treg as tgfβ <dig> is produced by a variety of other cells in vivo.

increased tgf β <dig> expression was also corroborated by real time pcr experiments on pbmcs incubated with iloprost for 15' and 120' in the presence or absence of pha .

treg cells are mainly involved in maintenance of self-tolerance, which is disrupted in ssc as in other immune disorders  <cit> . our data suggest that iloprost can enhance self tolerance and hence be useful in the treatment of ssc.

iloprost increases rankl production
receptor activator of nuclear factor κb ligand  is a cytokine with pleiotropic functions deeply involved in control of the immune system, and increased in inflammation  <cit> . among pbmcs it is mainly produced by t cells  <cit> . here we investigated the effect of iloprost on this cytokine. iloprost increases rankl production by pbmcs in cultures both after  <dig> days of infusion and  <dig> days after the last infusion , whereas it has no effect on serum rankl . in vitro pbmc stimulation with iloprost confirmed this in vivo effect . these data agree with recent studies  <cit>  in which rankl increased following stimulus with pge <dig>  iloprost increases serum il- <dig> 

il- <dig> is a cytokine deeply involved in the control of t cell development and function  <cit> , and controls treg suppressor function  <cit> . here we demonstrate that iloprost increases il- <dig> levels of about 15% after  <dig> days  and that this increase persists after the first course . to determine whether the effects of iloprost on tgfβ and rankl production are mediated by il- <dig>  we incubated pbmcs from buffy coats with il- <dig> and found that it had no effect on these cytokines .

iloprost does not affect ifnγ levels
ifnγ stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnfα by macrophages  <cit> . it has a pleiotropic immune function  <cit> , and may be involved in controlling t cell homeostasis  <cit> . iloprost does not affect serum and supernatant ifnγ  in keeping with its lack of any effect on monocyte tnf production.

discussion
prostaglandin i <dig> is a metabolite of arachidonic acid that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory functions  <cit> , however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of pgi2-mediated anti-inflammatory effects remain to be determined. here we evaluated the effect of iloprost, a pgi <dig> analogue, widely used in the treatment of ssc, on t cells sub-populations and on pro-inflammatory cytokines.

this study shows that infusion of iloprost, according to the standard protocol to treat raynaud's phenomenon in ssc patients, reduces t cells in the peripheral blood, especially tnf α producing t cells, according to previous in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit>  studies. the mechanism underling this effect was shown by jorres et al.  <cit>  that found that iloprost reduces tnf α transcriptional activity and decreases tnf α mrna stability in human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes stimulated with lps; our study is the first evaluation of the effect of iloprost on tnf α production and t cell subsets in ssc. our finding that iloprost acts on t cells only and not on monocytes is in contrast with di renzo et al.'s observation of a reduction of both monocytes and t cells  <cit> . this discrepancy may be attributable to the fact that they infused iloprost for  <dig> h/day for  <dig> days as required for critical limb ischemia. our data show that iloprost reduces both the total amount of tnf α positive t cells and their ability to secrete tnf α after an antigenic stimulus. the role of tnf α in autoimmune diseases is well known, and it is currently a target for monoclonal antibody in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . its reduction by iloprost may thus be an important plus in the evaluation of therapeutic options.

our study demonstrates a decrease in treg after  <dig> days of iloprost infusion in vivo, associated with enhancement of their ability to produce tgf β <dig> in response to immune stimulation. this effect could be due to a generic immunomodulation by iloprost through a systemic increase in il- <dig> production, as it is well known that this cytokine is deeply involved in the control of t cell development and function  <cit> , and it controls treg suppressor function  <cit> . our study demonstrates that iloprost consistently increases serum il- <dig> and that this increase persists  <dig> days after the last infusion. here we show that il  <dig> effect on tgf β <dig> production is not direct, but may be mediated trough other cell types in vivo. recently a role for dendritic cells in the mediation of iloprost anti-inflammatory activity has been postulated  <cit> 

the role of tfg β in determining the suppressor ability of tregs is currently under debate  <cit> , tgf β is crucial in determining the ability of tregs to convert foxp3- t cells into foxp3+ t cells by a mechanism of infectious tolerance  <cit> . recent data suggest an important role for treg cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases  <cit> , and it has been suggested that their number is increased, whereas their function is impaired, in ssc  <cit> . it may thus be supposed that the reduction in treg number coupled with the increase in their tgf β production may be critical for ssc therapy.

we measured the levels of rankl in serum and in supernatants because this molecule is important in inflammation and in the control of immune function  <cit>  and expected they would be reduced after iloprost similarly to the reduction in tnf. after iloprost instead we found an increase in rankl levels both as protein and as gene copies number. this could be interpreted as a class effect of prostaglandins, since recent studies  <cit>  have demonstrated an increase in rankl in cells after incubation with pge2; moreover conaway and colleagues demonstrated that both pge <dig> and pgi <dig> were able to enhance osteoclast activity that is mainly under rankl control  <cit> . however the rankl increase is not due to il- <dig> increase as demonstrated by the lack of il- <dig> effect on in vitro pbmcs.

our data demonstrated that iloprost does not influence ifn γ production. this cytokine is particularly involved in the inflammatory reaction of monocytes/macrophages and induces their tnf α secretion  <cit> ; hence the lack of effect of iloprost on ifn is in line with the absence of its effect on monocyte tnf α production.

CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests that iloprost has specific anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects: it reduces tnf α production by t cells without influence on tnf α monocyte production; it reduces the tregs number, but ameliorates their function probably trough an increase in il- <dig> and directly increases rankl. hence the therapeutic use of iloprost in ssc patients may be useful not only as vasodilator and antifibrotic, but also as immunomodulator agent.
