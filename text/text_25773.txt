BACKGROUND
t regulator cells  in the peripheral circulation of humans are usually ifnγ-. however, during stimulation cd4+cd25+cd127-foxp3+ treg are formed that co-express ifnγ, as reviewed by daniel et al.  <cit> . ifnγ+ treg are detectable in the blood of renal transplant recipients with good long-term graft function and in patients with autoimmune disease, such as type- <dig> diabetes and multiple sclerosis . they co-express ifnγ receptors on the cell surface and are inducible by ifnγ   <cit> . in addition to ifnγ, the cells produce tgfß and/or il <dig> and co-express cell surface receptors that are involved in cell-cell contact inhibition as well as effector cell killing, such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . separated cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ treg suppress mlcs unspecifically, although the strongest suppression is observed in antigen-specific mixed lymphocyte culture  settings  <cit> . the stronger the hla incompatibility and proliferation in mlc experiments, the stronger the induction of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ifnγ+ pbl  <cit> . interestingly, patients with poor long-term allograft function after renal transplantation are able to form cd4+cd25+foxp3+ifnγ+ pbl in mlc with pretransplant obtained peripheral blood lymphocytes   <cit> . however, posttransplant these patients showed lower frequencies of these cells in the periphery than renal transplant recipients with good long-term graft outcome  <cit> . this finding suggests that patients with poor long-term graft outcome did not develop or lost this particular treg subset posttransplant, perhaps because of intensified immunosuppressive treatment. the in-vitro behavior of ifnγ+cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg suggests that they form the first line of treg, patrolling in the body and searching for ifnγ and initial immune responses that they subsequently suppress.

origin and stability of suppressive function of ifnγ+ treg are important factors with respect to the clinical relevance of this treg subset  <cit> . usually, the foxp <dig> treg-specific demethylated region  of tregs is demethylated, whereas that of conventional t cells is methylated  <cit> . tsdr methylation persists during transient expression of foxp <dig> by convential t cells or unstable tgfß-induced treg, whereas drug-induced demethylation of conventional t cells results in stable foxp <dig> expression, suggesting that lineage stability in treg may be epigenetically regulated. signaling through ifnγr and il12r, in combination with t cell receptor  engagement, induces strong expression of the transcription factor t-bet, which drives the differentiation of conventional t cells to a t helper type  <dig>  lineage  <cit> . the ikaros family transcription factor helios has been shown to be selectively expressed in ntreg of thymic origin but not in peripherally induced atreg  <cit> . mcclymont et al. reported that the majority of in-vitro induced ifnγ+ tregs did not express helios, suggesting that they were generated extra-thymically  <cit> . alternatively, they might belong to a minority of helios- ntreg with demethylated tsdr expressing foxp <dig>  cd <dig>  ctla- <dig>  ccl <dig> and ifnγ, as published by himmel et al.  <cit> . further experiments showed that ntreg can polarize towards ifnγ+ t cells in-vitro by il <dig> conditioning whereby they remain helios+, suggesting that part of the thymic-derived treg population exhibits plasticity in cytokine production and expresses a th1-like phenotype  <cit> . hall et al. reported that rat ntreg stimulated with antigen and ifnγ or il <dig> expand and differentiate to antigen-specific ifnγ+ ntreg that have a 100- to 1000-fold increased suppressor potency as compared to ntreg  <cit> . this strongly potent antigen-specific ntreg subset with a th1-like phenotype might represent a suitable marker for monitoring graft-specific immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.

in the present study we examined the origin of ifnγ+ treg as determined by helios positivity in peripheral blood and pma/ionomycin-stimulated cell cultures performed with pbl from healthy individuals. furtheron, we investigated whether ifnγ+ treg can be induced by recombinant ifnγ  without additional stimulus and whether ifnγ+ treg after removal of the stimulus remain ifnγ+foxp3+ or, alternatively, decrease and differentiate to ifnγ+foxp3- th <dig> and/or ifnγ-foxp3+ treg. based on findings in mouse experiments, feng et al. reported that in-vitro induced ifnγ+ treg suppress inflammation effectively when transferred to mice with colitis but differentiate to th <dig> lymphocytes when adoptively transferred to mice without inflammation  <cit> . finally, we determined the foxp <dig> tsdr demethylation status of separated ifnγ+ treg in order to assess stability of foxp <dig> expression.

RESULTS
treg subsets in peripheral blood of healthy controls
figure  <dig> demonstrates the gating strategy. figure  <dig> depicts treg subset numbers in the blood of  <dig> healthy individuals. mean ± sem  of circulating cd4+ pbl was 799 ± 220/μl  and of circulating cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg  <dig>  ±  <dig> /μl . approximately two-thirds of all treg expressed the classical ntreg phenotype helios+ifnγ- . in contrast, only a small minority of treg produced ifnγ and was helios+ifnγ+  or helios-ifnγ+ . half of ifnγ+ treg appear to originate from the thymus  and represent activated ntreg, whereas the other half appear to be induced in the periphery  and represent atreg. cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg were found to express tgfß, cd62l, cxcr <dig>  cd <dig>  perforin, granzyme b, cd <dig>  hla-dr, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  tbet and ifnγr <dig> cd <dig>  the data suggest that ifnγ+ treg have the potential to enter secondary lymphoid organs as well as inflamed tissues  and are able to induce suppression of immune responses either by apoptosis , cell death , cytokine secretion  or cell-cell interaction . moreover, they have the potency to regulate production as well as consumption of ifnγ in the cell by surface receptors  and induction of transcription factors . interestingly, il10+ treg phenotypes were undetectable in the circulation whereas tgfß+ ifnγ+ treg were rather frequent .fig.  <dig> determination of treg subsets. a total cd4+ lymphocytes of a healthy individual were gated  and further analysed concerning intracellular helios and ifnγ positivity. the majority of circulating cd4+ lymphocytes was helios- and this gate was used for all further flow cytometric analyses of helios positivity. b stepwise gating strategy for treg subset determination: first, lymphocytes gate , then cd4+cd25+ pbl gate , foxp3+cd127- gate , and finally helios/ifnγ gate. further cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg subsets  were analysed using the depicted gate settings for il10/tgfß, cxcr3/cd62l, cd252/cd <dig> , cd119/tbet, cd28/hla-dr, cd152/cd <dig> , perforin/granzymeb, and cd95/cd178

cell cultures stimulated with rifnγ only
as shown previously, ifnγ+ treg express ifnγ receptors  <cit> . we hypothesized that ifnγ+ treg might be inducible by recombinant rifnγ without additional stimulus. when unseparated pbl of  <dig> healthy volunteers were stimulated with  <dig> or 1000 ng/ml rifnγ for  <dig> and 48 h, there was no statistically significant increase in any of the treg subsets depicted in fig.  <dig> . rather, there was a decrease of cxcr3+cd62l+  as well as cd152+cd154+  treg. the data suggest that rifnγ is unable to induce treg, especially ifnγ+ treg, in the absence of an additional stimulus.fig.  <dig> cell cultures stimulated with rifnγ only. unseparated pbl of  <dig> healthy individuals were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 500 ng/ml, 1000 ng/ml or without rifnγ. there was no significant increase of ifnγ+cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg during the culture period . the data suggest that rifnγ is unable to induce treg, especially ifnγ+cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg, without an additional stimulus. rather, there was a decrease of cxcr3+cd62l+  as well as cd152+cd154+  treg. data are given as mean ± sem. *p ≤  <dig> ; **p ≤  <dig> ; ***p ≤  <dig> 



ifnγ+ treg induced in-vitro in the presence of both rifnγ and pma/ionomycin
we speculated that rifnγ might induce ifnγ+ treg only in combination with an additional stimulus, such as pma/ionomycin, and that activated ntreg with helios+ifnγ+ phenotype originate mainly from the cd4+cd25+ pbl preparation. we therefore investigated the induction of ifnγ+ treg in cell cultures with unseparated pbl, enriched cd4+cd25+ and enriched cd4+cd25- pbl preparations. cd4+ pbl were enriched to 99 ±  <dig>  % purity. cd4+cd25+ enriched pbl fractions contained 87 ±  <dig>  % and the remaining cd4+cd25- pbl preparation 33 ±  <dig>  % cd4+cd25+ pbl. pbl preparations of  <dig> healthy individuals were stimulated for 72 h with pma/ionomycin in the presence of 500 ng/ml, 1000 ng/ml, 5000 ng/ml or without rifnγ.

unseparated pbl
stimulation of unseparated pbl with pma/ionomycin alone for 24 h increased the proportions of total cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127-  and helios-ifnγ+  treg, but decreased the proportion of helios+ifnγ-il10-tgfß+  treg . addition of rifnγ to pma/ionomycin-stimulated cell cultures decreased the proportions of helios+ifnγ-  and helios+ifnγ-il10-tgfß+  treg and increased the proportion of helios-ifnγ+  treg. it appears that rifnγ decreased the helios+ifnγ- and increased the helios-ifnγ+ treg subset in pma/ionomycin-stimulated cell cultures.fig.  <dig> ifnγ+ treg induced in-vitro in the presence of both rifnγ and pma/ionomycin. a pbl of  <dig> healthy individuals were stimulated for 72 h using pma/ionomycin in the presence of  <dig>   <dig>  5000 ng/ml or without rifnγ. pma/ionomycin-stimulated cultures without rifnγ were compared with those stimulated in the presence of rifnγ. b, c the same assay was performed using cell cultures with enriched cd4+cd25+ or enriched cd4+cd25- pbl. the data suggest that cd4+cd25+ pbl are rather resistant to the effect of rifnγ. in contrast, cd4+cd25- enriched pbl showed increasing total treg with both helios+ treg switching from ifnγ- to ifnγ+ and increasing ifnγ+helios- treg indicating that rifnγ in combination with a polyclonal stimulus induces activation of ntreg as well as induction of atreg. data are given as mean ± sem. *p ≤  <dig> ; **p ≤  <dig> ; ***p ≤  <dig> 



enriched cd4+cd25+ pbl
when, instead of unseparated pbl, cell preparations enriched for cd4+cd25+ pbl were stimulated, addition of rifnγ increased helios-ifnγ+  treg. helios+ifnγ+ treg decreased  but tended to increase in the presence of higher rifnγ concentrations in the culture medium  .

enriched cd4+cd25- pbl
stimulation of enriched cd4+cd25- pbl with pma/ionomycin alone increased total cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127-  and helios+ifnγ-  as well as helios+ifnγ+  treg . when rifnγ was added to pma/ionomycin-stimulated cell cultures, a decrease of helios+ifnγ- treg was noted  as well as of helios+ifnγ-il10-tgfß+ , whereas helios-ifnγ+  treg increased. a strong increase of total cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127-  and helios+ifnγ+  treg as well as an increase of helios-ifnγ+  treg was observed when freshly separated cd4+cd25- pbl were compared with cd4+cd25- pbl after 24 h stimulation with pma/ionomycin.

the data suggest that rifnγ in combination with pma/ionomycin decreases helios+ifnγ- and increases helios-ifnγ+ treg in-vitro and that this effect was more pronounced in cell cultures with enriched cd4+cd25- than in cell cultures with cd4+cd25+ pbl. treatment with rifnγ appears to increase total treg that are helios-ifnγ+ and induces a switch of helios+ treg from ifnγ- to ifnγ+. we conclude that rifnγ in combination with a polyclonal stimulus induces atreg and activates ntreg.

kinetics of treg subsets in-vitro in culture of cd4+cd25+ or cd4+cd25- pbl preparations after elimination of the stimulus
next, we studied the fate of treg subsets after removal of a short-term polyclonal stimulus. cd4+cd25+ enriched  and cd4+cd25+ depleted  cell preparations as well as unseparated pbl from  <dig> healthy individuals were stimulated with pma/ionomycin for 6 h. pma/ionomycin was washed out of the cell culture and treg subsets were analyzed again at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h. in pbl cell cultures, total cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127-  and helios+ifnγ+  treg increased after removal of the stimulus . an increase of cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127-  was also observed when cd4+cd25- enriched pbl fractions were studied instead of unseparated pbl . in contrast, cd4+cd25+ enriched pbl fractions showed only an increase of helios-ifnγ+ treg  . our data do not support the hypothesis  that removal of the stimulus results in a significant decrease of ifnγ- as well as ifnγ+ cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg due to loss of foxp <dig> expression. we found that helios+ as well as helios- ifnγ+ treg increased during the 96 h observation period.fig.  <dig> kinetics of treg subsets induced in-vitro from cd4+cd25+ or cd4+cd25- pbl preparations after elimination of the stimulus. unseparated as well as enriched cd4+cd25+ and cd4+cd25- cell preparations were stimulated with pma/ionomycin for 6 h and treg subsets were determined. mitogen was removed by several washes of the cell culture and treg subsets were determined again immediately after the washes at 7 h and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h after initiation of the cell culture. assays were performed with pbl from  <dig> healthy volunteers. the measurement 96 h after initiation of the cell culture was performed with only one cell donor. cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg increased after removal of the stimulus. the strong increase of cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg was also observed when instead of unseparated pbl cd4+cd25- enriched pbl fractions were used. in contrast, cd4+cd25+ enriched pbl fractions showed only an increase of helios-ifnγ+ treg. our data do not support the hypothesis that removal of the stimulus results in a significant decrease of ifnγ- as well as ifnγ+ cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg due to loss of foxp <dig> expression. data are given as mean ± sem. *p ≤  <dig> ; **p ≤  <dig> ; ***p ≤  <dig> 



foxp <dig> tsdr dna methylation status of ifnγ+ and ifnγ- treg preparations
because ifnγ+ cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg are nearly undetectable in the blood of healthy controls, ifnγ+ treg were purified by sequential enrichment of cd4+, cd25+, cd127- and ifnγ+ pbl resulting in cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ and cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ- treg preparations . cell preparations  enriched of ifnγ+ pbl had higher helios-ifnγ+  treg. foxp <dig> tsdr dna methylation was analyzed in enriched cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ and cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ- treg preparations from  <dig> healthy individuals. figure 6b + c shows the melt curves obtained with cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ treg fractions, fig. 6d + e the melt curves obtained with cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ- treg preparations.  <dig> of the  <dig> cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ and  <dig> of the  <dig> cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ- treg preparations showed partial foxp <dig> tsdr methylation of <50 % and  <dig> of the cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ and  <dig> of the cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ- treg preparations exhibited a very low foxp <dig> tsdr methylation of <10 %, suggesting that ifnγ+ and ifnγ- treg preparations show similar patterns of demethylated foxp <dig> tsdr. it appears that part of ifnγ+ treg have stable foxp <dig> expression and might represent activated ntreg.fig.  <dig> treg subsets and foxp <dig> tsdr dna methylation analysis in enriched cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+pbl preparations. a cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+ treg were separated from cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ- treg using pbl from  <dig> different healthy volunteers. cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- co-expressing helios-ifnγ+ were significantly enriched in the ifnγ+ treg preparation whereas cd95+cd178- treg were depleted compared to ifnγ- treg preparations. data are given as mean ± sem. *p ≤  <dig> . b-d foxp <dig> tsdr dna methylation analysis of enriched cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ+  and enriched cd4+cd25+cd127-ifnγ-  treg fractions from  <dig> healthy individuals . figure b and d and fig. c and e correspond with each other showing test results of the same individuals. in addition, melt curves of the standards with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 100 % methylated foxp <dig> tsdr dna are depicted in each diagram.  <dig> of  <dig> ifnγ+ treg preparations in fig. 6b,  <dig> of  <dig> ifnγ+ treg preparations in ,  <dig> of  <dig> ifnγ- treg preparations in  and  <dig> of  <dig> ifnγ- treg preparations in  showed a foxp <dig> tsdr methylation of <50 % representing mainly demethylated treg with stable foxp <dig> expression



discussion
we studied frequencies of ifnγ+ treg subsets in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and investigated whether ifnγ+ treg originate from helios+ cd4+cd25+ thymus-derived ntreg and might represent activated ntreg with foxp <dig> tsdr demethylation, stable foxp <dig> expression and strong suppressive potency, or, alternatively, differentiate peripherally from helios- cd4+cd25- conventional t lymphocytes representing atreg with foxp <dig> tsdr methylation, transient expression of foxp <dig> and low suppressive capacity  <cit> .

our data indicate that healthy individuals have both types of ifnγ+ treg in the blood and that both cell types co-express determinants characteristic for treg. however, only very few ifnγ+ treg in the blood can be separated with respect to helios positivity into activated ntreg and atreg. few of ifnγ+ as well as ifnγ- treg preparations showed strong demethylation of foxp <dig> tsdr, supporting the hypothesis that part of ifnγ+ treg represent activated ntreg. as shown by hall et al. in rats, activated ntreg form after stimulation with alloantigen in the presence of ifnγ or il <dig> and express a th1-like phenotype  <cit> . they have a 100- to 1000-fold increased suppressor potency over ntreg that were generated by antigen unspecific stimulation with il <dig> alone. these alloantigen-specific ifnγ+ ntreg, formed and activated in the presence of ifnγ, might be suitable candidates for treg monitoring in organ-grafted patients. an increase of this particular treg subset might indicate suppression of the graft-specific immune response. in a previous study, we were able to show that renal transplant recipients with good long-term graft function possessed higher proportions of ifnγ+ treg than patients with impaired long-term graft function  <cit> . helios positivity and foxp <dig> tsdr methylation status of ifnγ+ treg were not determined in that study.

our current in-vitro data show that ifnγ alone is unable to induce this th1-like treg subset. however, ifnγ in combination with a second stimulus amplifies the activation of ntreg switching from ifnγ- to ifnγ+, and, in addition, induces the differentiation of ifnγ+ atreg. this observation supports our hypothesis that ifnγ+ treg represent the first line of treg during an immune response. however, what is the fate of ifnγ+ treg when the immune response is stopped? do they become apoptotic or do they further differentiate to th <dig> lymphocytes, losing their foxp <dig> expression and forming potentially harmful graft-specific th <dig> lymphocytes? our data show that during 90 h after elimination of the polyclonal stimulus from the cell culture, both ifnγ+ ntreg and ifnγ+ atreg continue to increase. feng et al. reported that in-vitro induced murine ifnγ+ treg suppress inflammation effectively when transferred to mice with colitis, but differentiate to th <dig> lymphocytes when adoptively transferred to mice without inflammation  <cit> . ifnγ+ treg that were exposed to an ifnγ-containing milieu during our in-vitro experiments or after transfer into inflamed tissues during the in-vivo experiments of feng et al.  <cit>  remained phenotypically and functionally stable. based on the experiments of feng et al.  <cit> , we speculate that ifnγ+ treg, when not stimulated further by ifnγ, remain as resting harmless ntreg or foxp3-ifnγ- th <dig> lymphocytes that do not attack the graft in a transplant recipient. we believe that in stable transplant recipients the lack of il <dig> and ifnγ in the in-vivo milieu might render these per se graft-specific cells, which differentiated from th1-like treg to th <dig> lymphocytes, harmless.

as shown in the blood of healthy individuals, helios+ifnγ+ treg co-express tgfß but not il <dig>  further analysis of treg phenotypes showed that treg co-expressed, in-addition, granzyme b and perforin as well as fas  and fasl , thereby affording the treg the capacity to induce lysis and apoptosis of target cells  <cit> . moreover, expression of ctla- <dig>  and cd40l  imply cell-cell contact-dependent immunosuppression by these treg subsets. cxcr <dig> and cd62l expression suggests that part of these cells have the potential to enter secondary lymphoid organs as well as inflamed tissues  <cit> . these treg exhibit th <dig> characteristic properties such as ifnγr <dig>  and tbet expression, which means they have the potency to regulate expression as well as consumption of ifnγ in the cell. cd <dig> is involved in treg activation and hla-dr expression indicates activation of treg  <cit> . our present experiments show that these cell markers are expressed on ifnγ+ as well as ifnγ- treg in the peripheral blood  and this observation confirms the results of our previously published in-vitro studies  <cit> . expression of tgf, cd <dig>  cd62l, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  t-bet, hla-dr, perforin and granzyme b in/on circulating cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg provides insight into the immunosuppressive armamentarium and the mechanisms of ifnγ+ treg function. selection of the most appropriate treg population for cell therapy is a critical step in ensuring successful clinical outcomes, as reviewed recently  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the blood of healthy individuals, two-thirds of all cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg were found to be helios+ifnγ- ntreg. only a small minority represents helios+ifnγ+ activated ntreg or helios-ifnγ+ peripherally induced atreg. both ifnγ+ and ifnγ- treg preparations contain in part strongly demethylated foxp <dig> tsdrs, indicating stable foxp <dig> expression characteristic for ntreg. during polyclonal stimulation in the presence of rifnγ, helios-ifnγ+ atreg are induced and resting helios+ifnγ- ntreg differentiate to activated helios+ifnγ+ thymically-derived ntreg. rifnγ alone is unable to induce this differentiation. polyclonal activation induces the expression of ifnγr <dig>  and these receptors are necessary for the stimulating effect of auto- and paracrine secreted ifnγ. cd <dig> is expressed on ifnγ+, ifnγ-, helios+ as well as helios- treg. the frequency of each subset in the peripheral blood was <5 % of cd4+cd25+foxp3+cd127- treg . the present data provide further insight into the in-vivo and in-vitro characteristics of ifnγ+ treg and help to understand their role in immunoregulation. alloantigen-specific demethylated ifnγ+ helios+ ntreg might represent a suitable marker for monitoring graft-specific immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.
