BACKGROUND
bowerbirds are a remarkable group of passerine birds in which males build elaborate structures of plant material adorned with coloured objects to attract females. these displays are among the most striking examples of sexually selected traits. consequently, bowerbirds have become a model system in visual ecology and evolutionary biology, particularly with respect to the evolution of visual signals  <cit> . birds have a visual system well suited for colour detection with four types of cone visual pigments that span a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum extending into the ultraviolet . uv based signals in particular can play important roles in avian behaviours  <cit> , especially in mate choice in passerines  <cit>  and parrots  <cit> .

the first step in vision is the absorption of light by visual pigments in the photoreceptor cells of the retina. visual pigments consist of an opsin protein covalently bound to a light sensitive chromophore via a schiff base  link. absorption of a photon of light triggers a cis-trans isomerization in the chromophore that induces subsequent conformational changes in the opsin protein. this change allows the visual pigment to bind and activate the downstream heterotrimeric g-protein, transducin, thus initiating the visual transduction cascade in the photoreceptor cell  <cit> . the wavelength of maximal absorbance of a visual pigment  is determined by the interactions between the opsin protein and its chromophore, via a process known as spectral tuning  <cit> .

the short-wavelength-sensitive  pigments mediate sensitivity to light in the violet to uv range. this group of pigments exhibits the broadest range in spectral sensitivity across vertebrates, and are generally divided into two groups based on λmax: violet-sensitive  and uv-sensitive   <cit> . in sws <dig> pigments, spectral tuning mechanisms can be quite complicated, and can differ across vertebrate pigments  <cit> . however, among vertebrates, sws <dig> spectral tuning mechanisms in birds appear to be fairly unique and unusually straightforward. mutagenesis studies in a variety of birds indicate the most important site is  <dig>  with mutations at this site responsible for determining whether a pigment absorbs maximally in the violet or uv  <cit> . phenylalanine  at site  <dig> appears to be a second mechanism by which birds achieve uvs because it is found in the sws <dig> genes of some birds  <cit> , and site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that it can blue shift wavelength sensitivity in some avian vs-type sws <dig> pigments  <cit>  as well as in other vertebrates  <cit> , with the exception of some primates  <cit> . however, the paucity of mutagenesis studies on sws <dig> pigments throughout the diverse avian orders somewhat limits our abilities to extrapolate upon the roles of spectral tuning sites across all birds.

here, we use site-directed mutagenesis and ancestral reconstruction methods in order to characterize the absorption spectra of ancestral passerine/parrot sws <dig> pigments, and to investigate sws <dig> spectral tuning mechanisms using the great bowerbird pigment as a model system. until recently, the parrots and passerines were thought to be divergent orders within landbirds, but in fact have been found to be sister groups in a number of recent studies  <cit> , though this relationship is not always recovered  <cit> . the relationship between passerines and parrots is relevant to understanding the evolution of uv/violet vision in birds because both groups are thought to contain uvs due to the presence of c <dig>  <cit> , raising the question of when uv sensitivity may have arisen in these groups. recent results indicate some basal songbird lineages may have vs pigments  <cit>  and in fact, a variety of other basal passerine lineages including some flycatchers have also been found to possess s <dig>  suggestive of vs pigments  <cit> . as one of the basal passerine lineages whose ecology and behaviour have been the subject of detailed study, the great bowerbird  provides an ideal system with which to study the function and evolution of avian vision. in this study we not only isolate and characterize the sws <dig> pigment from c. nuchalis as a vs-type opsin, we also explore the function and evolution of recreated ancestral sws <dig> pigments in passerines and parrots. we present experimental evidence indicating that although passerines and parrots evolved uvs by the same molecular mechanism, the passerine ancestor and parrot/passerine ancestor both had vs-type pigments, indicating uvs evolved independently in these two groups. we also investigate spectral tuning mutants of c. nuchalis sws <dig>  finding that λmax is affected similarly by the mutations c86s, c86f and s90c as in other avian sws <dig> opsins, suggesting spectral tuning in avian sws <dig> pigments is unusually consistent compared to other vertebrate groups.

RESULTS
great bowerbird sws <dig> spectral tuning mutants
the sequenced c. nuchalis sws <dig> gene was found to contain amino acid residues c <dig> and s <dig>  a combination found in past sequencing-surveys of avian sws <dig> opsins  <cit> , but one that has not been investigated in any in vitro expression and mutagenesis experiments. the expressed wild type bowerbird pigment was found to have a vs-type absorption spectrum . this lies within the range of other expressed vs-type sws <dig> avian opsins  <cit> . mutating s90c in bowerbird sws <dig> resulted in a uvs pigment , with a 40 nm blue shift relative to wild type . a similar effect was found with the c86f mutant, which also resulted in a uvs pigment . however, the mutation c86s had no effect . the double mutant c86s/s90c had a λmax at 363 nm, identical to the s90c single mutant . homology modeling studies of bowerbird sws <dig> structure confirm that there are only minor differences in side chain orientation for both c86s and s90c; however for c86f there is a large difference in side chain orientation, with f much closer to the protonated schiff base .

due to the short-wavelength λmax of the bowerbird sws <dig> and its mutants, a number of assays were performed in order to demonstrate a properly folded protein with bound 11-cis retinal chromophore, and to further characterize its function. in order to demonstrate a covalently bound chromophore, sws <dig> pigments regenerated with 11-cis retinal were denatured in hcl, producing absorbance peaks shifted to 440 nm , characteristic of denatured opsin bound to chromophore  <cit> . all sws <dig> pigments with λmax above 400 nm were bleached with light to ~380 nm, characteristic of the biologically active state of visual pigments, metarhodopsin ii  <cit> . finally, the wild type bowerbird sws <dig> pigment was found to react in the presence of hydroxylamine , with a t1/2 = ~6 min, typical of cone pigments  <cit> .

some of the pigments were occasionally found to have small secondary absorbance peaks in the longwave arm of the curve, which can have the effect of broadening pigment absorbance curves. these have previously been observed in wild type and mutant sws <dig> pigments expressed in solution  <cit> . this has also been observed in blue shifted rh <dig> mutants with mutations at site  <dig>  <cit> . in this study, experimental attempts to narrow the absorption spectra, including the use of tris phosphate buffers, exclusion of glycerol, decreasing purification time and minimizing light and temperature exposure, were unsuccessful, similar to previous experimental studies  <cit> .

in addition to sws <dig>  four other opsin genes were also isolated from c. nuchalis: sws <dig>  rh <dig>  and lws, and rod opsin  . all opsin genes were found to contain important structural characteristics typical of functional visual pigments. phylogenetic analyses show these sequences cluster with expected visual pigment families .

reconstructing passerine and parrot/passerine ancestral sws <dig> pigments
in order to investigate the evolution of uv sensitivity in passerines and parrots, a combination of bayesian and maximum likelihood ancestral reconstruction methods were used to infer the sequence of helix  <dig> of sws <dig> in the ancestors of passerines and parrots . reconstructed amino acid substitutions at major spectral tuning sites were mapped on a landbird phylogeny . relative to site  <dig>  less variation was found at sites  <dig> and  <dig>  with a notable substitution, s86c, occurring at the base of the passerine lineage. interestingly, substitutions at site  <dig> were found to occur multiple times throughout the passerine phylogeny, and always involve a change from s to c, suggestive of multiple shifts towards uv sensitivity . this finding is in disagreement with a previous study proposing that the residue at site  <dig> has transitioned back and forth between s and c multiple times throughout passerine evolution  <cit> . their results would suggest that transitions between uv and violet pigments are quite labile, whereas our results would imply more constrained evolution.

sws <dig> pigments for the ancestors of the passerines and parrots were experimentally recreated in the background of our c. nuchalis pigment. this was done for a number of reasons. first, we were limited by current sequence data, which only exists for helix  <dig> for most bird sws <dig> genes, as all known spectral tuning sites are thought to be contained in this helix. second, as a basal passerine, c. nuchalis sws <dig> differed from the reconstructed ancestral sequences at specific sites in helix  <dig>  allowing us to generate the ancestrally reconstructed sequences using site-directed mutagenesis methods. third, our ability to make direct functional comparisons between the ancestral pigments and that of c. nuchalis allowed us to better interpret the effects of particular amino acid substitutions. the experimentally assayed, recreated ancestral sws <dig> pigments were both found to be vs pigments, absorbing maximally in the vs at 403 nm  and 404 nm . both ancestral pigments were found not only to bind retinal, but also to activate in response to light and denature in acid . the reconstructed nodes had high posterior probability values across sites . reconstructions on an alternate topology favored by previous visual pigment studies  <cit>  did not find any differences with our experimentally recreated sequences .

discussion
this study extends our understanding of sws <dig> opsin function and evolution by investigating evolutionary changes that occurred in avian sws <dig> genes. the sws <dig> opsin of the great bowerbird c. nuchalis, a basal passerine bird, was expressed along with a series of spectral tuning mutants and ancestral passerine sws <dig> pigments allowing us to investigate spectral tuning mechanisms and identify the evolution of uv/violet sensitivity in early passerines and parrots. the c. nuchalis sws <dig> opsin was found to be a vs pigment, with a maximal absorbance of 403 nm, which is in agreement with previous msp studies identifying a λmax of 404 nm  <cit> . however, our experimentally recreated passerine ancestral sws <dig> pigments were also found to be vs, addressing a longstanding issue of ancestral passerine sws <dig> spectral tuning in previous studies  <cit> .

evolution of uv/violet vision in passerines and parrots
our finding that the passerine ancestor had a violet-type sws <dig> reaches slightly different conclusions in comparison with a recent study suggesting that the passerine ancestor was uvs  <cit> , which was the first paper examining avian sws <dig> evolution that used a phylogeny in which passerines and parrots were specified sister orders. not only are the predicted ancestral sequences different, but a vs-type λmax in ancestral pigment was experimentally confirmed in our study. while it is not entirely clear why our study reached such different conclusions, there are a number of important differences. our analysis included additional outgroup sequences, and used maximum likelihood reconstruction methods . furthermore, in our study the ancestral pigments were experimentally recreated and functionally assayed. finally, our phylogeny is based on the current understanding of phylogenetic relationships among landbirds that includes a recent revision of the relationships among higher lineages  <cit> , and therefore is somewhat different from that of odeen et al.  <cit> . however, we did not find any differences in our reconstructions of the ancestral passerine sws <dig> when we used a tree with the relationships among higher passerines arranged similar to their phylogeny, suggesting that the difference in our findings from previous studies are probably due to methodological differences, such as the use of maximum likelihood reconstruction methods and/or the use of additional outgroup lineages.  our results support earlier studies that investigated the evolution of uv/violet sensitivity in birds suggesting the passerine ancestor had a vs type sws <dig>  <cit> , but these early studies do not place passerines and parrots as sister orders. because the parrots are now thought to be closer to the basal passerines than before, our results are more robust than they would be if based upon the older tree.

our findings, that uvs in passerines and parrots evolved from vs ancestors, and that this occurred independently in at least two lineages, are rather unusual with respect to other vertebrate groups. the ancestral vertebrate state is thought to have been uvs, with vs pigments evolving independently in various lineages within fish, mammals, and amphibians  <cit> . birds are believed to be an interesting exception where a switch to vs is thought to have occurred in the ancestral avian pigment with some descendants subsequently re-evolving uvs  <cit> . our identification of vs type pigments in both passerine and parrot/passerine ancestors confirm this hypothesis, and our ancestral reconstruction results provide a more precise prediction of where these spectral sensitivity shifts occurred. the re-evolution of uvs from a vs type pigment has not previously been predicted elsewhere in the vertebrate phylogeny. the reasons why bird sws <dig> pigments are an exception remain largely unknown, but may be related to their unique spectral tuning mechanisms among vertebrates.

spectral tuning in c. nuchalis sws1
the c. nuchalis vs pigment possesses an unusual residue combination at the two spectral tuning sites known to be most important in specifying uvs or vs in vertebrates: c86/s <dig>  this residue combination has been found in a few passerine sws <dig> opsins in past sequence-based surveys  <cit> , but its spectral relevance has not been examined using mutagenesis experiments, which thus far have only dealt with vs-type pigments with s86/s <dig>  in pigeon and chicken,  <cit>  and uvs type with either a86/c <dig> or c86/c <dig>  in budgerigar and zebra finch, respectively  <cit> . past mutagenesis studies of vertebrate sws <dig> pigments have shown the magnitude of λmax shift caused by a given amino acid change can differ significantly among pigments due to synergistic interactions within and between transmembrane regions i-vii  <cit> . characterization of c. nuchalis sws <dig> mutants was therefore carried out, as it may provide new clarification of the mechanisms contributing to the naturally occurring variation in avian sws <dig> pigment spectral sensitivity, particularly among the vs type pigments. these mutants can also help clarify patterns of evolution between vs and uvs visual systems in birds.

our results showing that s90c shifts the c. nuchalis sws <dig> into the uv is consistent with previous studies where similar shifts have been documented in the chicken, pigeon, and the reverse in zebra finch, and budgerigar  <cit> . in c. nuchalis, the effect of the double mutant c86s/s90c was identical to that of the single s90c mutant. thus, in the presence of c <dig>  c <dig> has no additional effect on sensitivity. in other avian pigments, substitutions at known spectral tuning sites also do not change λmax if expressed with c <dig>  <cit> . others have suggested that the effect of c <dig> is so strong it prevents detection of any subtler effects other residues might have  <cit> . in birds, all in vitro expressed pigments, whether wild type or mutant, with c <dig> have λmax ~360 nm. the exception is in chicken where s90c only shifts λmax to 369 nm  <cit> .

the mutation c86f in c. nuchalis also shifts λmax into the uv. unlike c <dig>  which, as far as we know only has a functional role in avian sws <dig> opsins, f <dig> is an important spectral tuning site across vertebrates where it confers uvs in most pigments in which it occurs  <cit> , the exception being the aye-aye, which is vs despite the presence of f <dig>  <cit> . it is, in fact, believed to be the ancestral vertebrate state and substitutions from f <dig> are responsible for the loss of uvs in many mammalian lineages  <cit> , and in ancient birds  <cit> . in c. nuchalis, c <dig> therefore plays an important role in maintaining sensitivity in the violet range, as the replacement of c86f shifts λmax into the ancestral uv state. f <dig> is also interesting because it has been suggested to be a second mechanism by which birds achieve uvs: it is found in the sws <dig> genes of some birds including the trogon, paleognaths and a few sandgrouses and motmots  <cit> , is capable of uv shifting vs pigments of pigeon and chicken  <cit> , and is responsible for uvs in fish and most mammals  <cit> . correspondingly, our mutagenesis results support the hypothesis that extant birds with f <dig> are uvs, and, therefore, the supposition that there are at least two mechanisms determining uvs in birds  <cit> . the expression of a wild type pigment with f <dig> would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.

in contrast to the previous mutants, c86s did not affect λmax in the c. nuchalis sws <dig>  this mutation was previously suggested as contributing to the broad spectral variation observed among vs type pigments  <cit> , which in birds range from 388 nm  to 420 nm   <cit> . site  <dig> is an important spectral tuning site in other vertebrate sws <dig> pigments, and s86c is capable of shifting λmax into the uv in a hypothetical ancestral avian sws <dig>  <cit> . as with c. nuchalis sws <dig>  s86c barely shifts λmax in the pigeon sws <dig>  <cit> , and mutation to serine at site  <dig> has no effect on the budgerigar sws <dig>  <cit> . therefore the residues responsible for this large variation in λmax among vs pigments remain unknown. altogether, these studies indicate that the role of site  <dig> in avian sws <dig> pigments depends not only on the residue at that site, but also on the background in which it is expressed. this is particularly true of mammalian sws <dig> pigments where the variation at site  <dig> is better characterized: in most mammalian pigments the presence of f <dig> dramatically shifts λmax, into the uv  <cit> , but this is not always the case  <cit> .

implications for behavioural ecology
while higher passerine lineages with uv type pigments are known to use uv signals in communication  <cit> , current evidence indicates no link between colouration and spectral sensitivity in bowerbirds  <cit> . here we have shown that despite the fact males display uv reflecting feathers and objects during courtship  <cit> , c. nuchalis does not possess a uv type sws <dig> visual pigment. these findings would seem to contradict evidence demonstrating a strong link between spectral tuning and signal colouration in other vertebrate groups,  <cit> , and the belief that uv type pigments offer a dramatic advantage by improving sensitivity in this short wave range  <cit> .

the general correlation between colouration and sensitivity remains because birds with vs pigments can perceive uv; sws <dig> visual pigments absorb strongly over most of the uv visible range  <cit> , cone oil droplets are effectively transparent to light in this range  <cit>  and, in most species, avian ocular media transmit most short wavelength light  <cit> . the difference in uv sensitivity between uvs, vs and the blue shifted bowerbird vs is just a matter of degree. nevertheless, while uv colouration might be perceived by bowerbirds, its importance in communication is not well understood. in the satin bowerbird  plumage uv reflectance is correlated with factors such as the intensity of infection from blood parasites, feather growth rate, and body size  <cit> , but it is unrelated to mating success  <cit> .

given that c. nuchalis and other bowerbird ocular media transmit more uv wavelengths than most other species with vs-type visual pigments, they might represent a transitional link in the evolution from a vs to a uvs visual system  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by the comparatively blue shifted sws <dig> found in bowerbirds, which further augments uv sensitivity. given the similarly blue shifted λmax of the ancestral sws <dig> pigments, this hypothesized transitional state might have originated in the ancestral passerine, and be shared among other basal passerines as well. this could also explain the unusually high number of shifts from vs to uvs in this order. further investigation into the evolutionary history of ocular transmission would be useful to clarify this possibility.

if an organism with a blue shifted vs pigment, like the great bowerbird, has sufficient uv sensitivity, then the adaptive advantage of a switch to uvs might not be as large as it would be if it could perceive little uv or only had the ancestral vs pigment. aside from λmax, there are a number of other structural and functional differences between vs and uvs opsins that may be related to a deprotonated schiff base linkage to the chromophore  <cit> . these differences may have important consequences for the evolution of uvs in birds and other vertebrates. therefore, it is possible that the wavelength difference between uvs and vs type pigments might not be the only, or the most important, functional difference between them. further biochemical and mutagenesis studies would be necessary to refine the functional differences between these two opsin subtypes.

CONCLUSIONS
our in vitro experiments suggest that spectral tuning in c. nuchalis is likely mediated by mechanisms very similar to those of other birds. this is unusual relative to spectral tuning mechanisms within mammals, which vary considerably among and within the major mammalian orders. in addition, despite both parrots and passerines sharing uv sensitivity and the same spectral tuning mechanism the experimentally recreated ancestral passerine and parrot/passerine sws <dig> pigments were both found to be maximally sensitive in the violet; this suggests that uv sensitivity may have evolved independently in passerines and parrots from a violet sensitive ancestor. moreover, our ancestral sequence reconstructions of sws <dig> in landbird evolution suggest that transitions from vs to uvs are much more likely than the reverse. our ancestral reconstruction experiments allow for a more precise prediction of where spectral sensitivity shifts may have occurred, and provide an unusual example where descendants have re-evolved uvs from a violet type ancestor; the reverse being more common in most vertebrates.
