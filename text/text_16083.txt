BACKGROUND
influenza a virus is classified into subtypes h <dig> to h <dig> and n <dig> to n <dig> based on the antigenic specificity of hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase . the  <dig> ha subtypes of the influenza viruses found in aquatic birds act as the carrier  of all avian influenza virus a  <cit> . only two influenza a subtypes  are currently circulating in the human population, while h <dig> and h <dig> are the most malignant, causing death in avian species  <cit> . the emergence of the h5n <dig> highly pathogenic avian influenza  virus caused highly contagious and deadly disease outbreaks in poultry in several asian countries, including china, indonesia, cambodia, japan, korea, laos, thailand, and vietnam  <cit> . recently, the h5n <dig> virus has been shown to spread incessantly to many regions all over the world  <cit> . most of these outbreaks were confined to poultry, but the virus was reported to be transmitted to humans in a few countries and most of these cases lead to death in infected human. despite the comparatively small number of human cases, this situation warrants careful monitoring. of foremost concern is the risk that conditions in parts of asia could give rise to an influenza pandemic  <cit> . as of august  <dig>  there have been totally  <dig> cases of confirmed h5n <dig> infection in humans, resulting in  <dig> fatalities  <cit> .

rapid and sensitive laboratory and field tests for the diagnosis of h5n <dig> hpai infection are essential for disease control  <cit> . conventional laboratory methods for h5n <dig> virus detection include virus isolation in embryonated eggs or madin-darby canine kidney  cells, followed by subsequent ha and na subtype identification using serological methods  <cit> . molecular detection methods such as reverse transcriptase pcr  have been widely applied for the laboratory diagnosis of influenza infections and ha subtype identification  <cit> . however, these methods are technically demanding and time consuming, or requiring high level biosafety facility. therefore, antigen detection based on serologic methods has repeatedly shown its value to diagnose various infectious diseases.

the development of a panel of broad spectrum h5-specific monoclonal antibodies used in rapid antigen tests allows to differentiate h <dig> subtype from other ha types in the field. detection of h <dig> antigen provides strong evidence of h <dig> avian influenza virus infection  <cit> . monoclonal antibody  based diagnostic antigen detection tests for h <dig> aiv have been reported. monoclonal antibodies are a homogenous population of antibodies, derived from a single antibody-producing cell whereby all antibodies produced are identical and of the same specificity for a given epitope  <cit> . the specificity of these mabs responses provides a basis for an effective diagnostic reagent  <cit> . however, as an rna virus, aiv tends to change its antigenic structure during evolution. antigenic drift leads to hemagglutinin variants within each ha subtype from different globe regions at different times. certain mabs that specifically target a given ha epitope of one type aiv, may not be able to recognize other aiv strains with a mutated antigenic epitope even if such a mutation is slight. therefore, using one single mab for h <dig> aiv antigen detection, in most cases, will not cover all the h <dig> subtype aiv circulating world around. here we report the development of an antigen-capture dot elisa based on a pair of mabs targeting the same epitope on h <dig>  however, by two different and dominant amino acids respectively, in an attempt to make a universal h <dig> aiv rapid detection test.

RESULTS
identification of monoclonal antibodies recognizing complementary epitopes on h <dig> hemagglutinin
a panel of mabs against influenza hemagglutinin was screened for efficient detection of different strains of h5n <dig> viruses. based on the results of the hi assay, mabs 6b <dig> and 4c <dig> were chosen for further studies due to their high hi activity  against a wide range of rescued reassortant viruses from different clades. both mabs were found to be of the igm isotype. after the virus neutralizing activity has been confirmed , the amino acids involved in forming the epitopes of the mabs were analyzed using escape mutant analysis. all ha amino acid numbering in this work uses h <dig> numbering excluding the signal peptide. upon sequencing escape mutants from  <dig> different parental strains , a few mutant clones of mab 6b <dig> showed mutations at either lys <dig> or asn <dig>  while clones of mab 4c <dig> presented mutations at arg <dig>  ser <dig> or asn <dig>  the results indicated that the 189th and 155th amino acids were involved in the epitopes of both mabs, but in different forms. mab 6b <dig> is able to bind to h <dig> with either lys <dig> or asn <dig> independently. mab 4c <dig> binds to arginine on 189th amino acid of h <dig>  and it recognizes both serine and asparagine at position  <dig> 

the number indicated the amino acid position in h <dig> ha. the amino acid type on the position was shown after the number. --: the mab does not react with the parental virus.

in order to determine the significance of the two epitopes of 6b <dig> and 4c <dig>  the protein polymorphism of h <dig> was studied, taking into account all h <dig> sequences in the ncbi database. as shown in the table  <dig>  among both avian and human h5n <dig> strains, arg and lys appear in more than  <dig> % of h5n <dig> strains in the 189th amino acid, while asn and ser are the most dominant amino acids in the position  <dig>  this finding indicated that the mab pair, which can cover the two epitopes, is able to recognize more than  <dig> % of h5n <dig> strains in the database. based on this, mabs 6b <dig> and 4c <dig> were thought to have good potential for being used in combination to detect h5n <dig> infections.

to further ascertain this prediction, an antigen capture elisa was performed, and the two mabs were found to recognize complementary epitopes and react with all the h5n <dig> viruses from different clades available in our laboratory . hence, it was concluded that the mab 6b <dig> and 4c <dig> complemented each other and were a good pair to use in rapid antigen detection of h <dig> influenza.

avalues represent the mean absorbance from triplicate wells.

combination of monoclonal antibodies in h <dig> dot elisa
different concentrations of mabs were used before confirming the optimal concentration in a prototype rapid test.  <dig> ug each of 6b <dig> and 4c <dig> were immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane and serve as capturing antibodies, the sample was lysed with  <dig> ul lysis buffer and loaded on the membrane with a filter device. the h5n <dig> virus captured by the immobilized h5-specific antibodies is detected using a mixture of mab 6b <dig> and 4c <dig> labeled with horseradish peroxidase. the entire test procedure is completed within  <dig> minutes  <cit> .

determination of analytical specificity and sensitivity
the specificity of the h <dig> dot elisa was tested with a total of  <dig> hpai h <dig> strains isolated from humans and avian species and  <dig> non-h <dig> subtype influenza virus strains from different regions and years, including  <dig> seasonal influenza virus strains  and  <dig> pandemic influenza virus strains circulating in humans. viruses of h <dig> or ha subtypes not available in our laboratory were rescued by reverse genetics with the six internal genes from a/puerto rico/8/ <dig>  the reactivity and specificity of the h <dig> dot-elisa were examined with  <dig> ul of pbs containing the h <dig> strains adjusted to an ha titer of  <dig>  non-h <dig> viruses with ha titers of  <dig> were used in order to eliminate false-positive results. virus strains listed in table  <dig> and  <dig> were tested in the laboratory and the rest strains were studied at the sites of those virus donors. the dot elisa rapid test with 4c <dig> and 6b <dig> can successfully detect all the  <dig> h <dig> virus strains from different clades, covering clades  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and representative h <dig> indonesia isolates, which belong to clade  <dig> . no cross-reactivity was observed for any of the non-h <dig> subtype viruses tested. other avian viruses such as newcastle disease , infectious bursal disease , were also tested to be negative with the h <dig> dot elisa.

the analytical sensitivity of the h <dig> dot elisa was determined against  <dig> strains of h <dig> virus belonging to the major genetic groups  diluted serially. as shown in table  <dig>  the detection limit of the test varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ha units/ <dig> ul of sample. the detection limit of the commercial kit for influenza a virus detection  was determined to be  <dig> ul of sample containing at least  <dig>  ha titer of virus.

performance of h <dig> dot elisa in the detection of variant h5n <dig> indonesia strains in poultry samples relative to rt-pcr
the dot elisa test was further evaluated with poultry samples. the swabs from birds infected with h5n <dig> virus can secrete virus of titer higher than l <dig> eid50/ml. samples were serially diluted  <dig> times from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> with pbs and tested by the dot elisa kit to determine the detection limit for swabs. the sensitivity test indicated that the dot elisa kit was able to detect the presence of virus at a concentration down to  <dig> eid50/ml in swabs, suggesting the test can be used for the detection of h <dig> infection in sick birds.

from  <dig> samples taken from clinically healthy birds, one sample was found to be positive with the test. the same sample was confirmed to be the only positive swab among the  <dig> samples in rt-pcr with h <dig> specific primers.  <dig> tracheal swabs obtained from sick birds were also tested with both dot elisa and rt-pcr . the results with the dot elisa showed that nine samples were positive for h <dig> infection. the same result was observed from the verification with rt-pcr.

as shown in table  <dig>  specificity test using various h5n <dig> viruses from several years and areas in indonesia showed that the elisa kit is 90% specific compared with rt-pcr using h <dig> primers, but 100% specific compared to ha <dig> primer. this indicates that the dot elisa kit is able to detect h5n <dig> as long as the virus did not undergo a genetic mutation in their ha genes. taken together, these findings indicate that the dot elisa kit is suitable for specific early detection of h <dig> virus infection in avian species.

discussion
point-of care rapid tests are designed and marketed for use in the ambulatory setting, in order to guide physicians in making the best possible clinical decisions and help farmers in preventing animal disease spreading and stopping the immediate threat to human health. conventional methods for h <dig> virus detection are time-consuming and technically demanding, and most importantly, these methods are not practical for field investigation  <cit> . several rapid diagnostic kits for the detection of h <dig> subtype viruses have been reported. but more than a couple of monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies are required to reach appropriate specificity and sensitivity of detection, which increases production cost  <cit> . the application of the complementary mab pair reported in this study provides a solution to this and makes it possible for the cost effective production of rapid h <dig> tests for field usage.

one of the h <dig> strains from chicken, which can not be detected by the dot elisa, was subjected to ha sequencing. the sequence result indicated that multiple deletions occur in its h <dig> sequence, such as the 353rd and the 387th nucleotide. these mutations may cause changes in ha protein structure and abolish the interaction to specific mabs. these nature virus mutants may not replicate properly and spread efficiently due to their genetic instability. therefore, it is concluded that the dot elisa performed here is able to detect those circulating h5n <dig> viruses that did not change genetically in their ha genes. unlike chicken, duck and other water fowls do not show any symptom even if they are infected with high concentration of h <dig> virus  <cit> . these virus carriers can cause virus shedding and spreading. virus titration studies indicate that these non-symptomatic birds can shed more than  <dig> eid50/ml of the virus to the environment. the dot test developed here is sensitive enough to achieve specific early detection in poultry species. therefore, the use of the h <dig> dot elisa rapid test on site will reduce the risk of the false negative results via symptom observation only. though, as a common challenge for all the rapid field tests, there is the possibility of false negative results due to the limitation of test sensitivity, this h <dig> dot elisa serves as an effective tool for h <dig> screening at the very early stage. for those possible infected populations, it is still necessary to confirm with rt-pcr after the primary h <dig> infection screening with this rapid test first, if the clinical condition allows.

selection of the h <dig> ha specific mabs for the development of the h <dig> dot elisa was based on detailed analyses of their binding properties. the selected h5-specific mab 4c <dig> and 6b <dig> demonstrated high specificity to h <dig> ha in the hi assay and ifa. neutralization escape mutants with the mab pair showed substitutions at amino acid positions  <dig> and  <dig>  these amino acids are two of the key residues in the h <dig> receptor-binding site of the globular head of the ha molecule. h5n <dig> hpai viruses are classified into distinct phylogenic clades based on their phylogenetic divergence  <cit> . the mab pair described here recognizes multiple clades of h5n <dig> viruses, including clades  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the h <dig> dot elisa. this result could suggest that the epitope-binding sites of the two complementary mabs are highly conserved in h5n <dig> viruses. such conformational epitopes in the receptor binding site are ha subtype-specific  <cit> . future studies will be performed to apply this mab pair for therapeutic purpose against h <dig> influenza infection without mutant evasion  <cit> .  <dig> non-h <dig> subtype influenza virus strains were tested to be negative in this dot elisa. though they constitute only a small subset of the possible viruses, the cross-reactivity of the h <dig> dot elisa with other subtype viruses is believed to be extremely low. further evaluation, however, will be performed with more samples, especially human samples, to determine the specificity of the assay in a more quantitative way.

the performance of the h <dig> dot elisa has been proved to be stable based on a standard method in which the kits were stored at 37°c for a week . the study indicated that the h <dig> dot elisa developed here is suitable for the usage in field where the storage condition at low temperature is not available. it has been studied as well that the performance of the test will not be affected by those potential chemical ingredients in oral or nasal swabs, such as antibiotics, mouth wash and nasal sprays. however, the only drawback of the current test is the potential cross reaction with bloody samples, which may cause false-positive results during testing. fortunately, a new technology developed recently provides solution to this problem. the target can be detected by fluorescence labeled antibodies and be observed with a portable fluorescence reader. any false positive signal from blood will be eliminated by using fluorescence with target-specific wave length.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the h <dig> dot elisa developed can serve as rapid devices for the on-site detection of h <dig> influenza virus. it has been evaluated in this study with tracheal swabs from avian species. it could also be used to test other types of swabs from other species, such as mammals. future studies will be performed to confirm this. based on complementary mabs, the test can respond to more than 99% of circulating h <dig> influenza viruses with the as sensitivity as a rapid field test. further investigation, however, is needed to shorten the processing time of each test for a new generation of rapid field tests.

based on all these studies, indicating that the test is convenient for field use, this h <dig> dot elisa can be used for on-site detection of h5n <dig> infection in clinical or environmental specimens and facilitate the investigation of h5n <dig> influenza outbreaks and surveillance in poultry.
