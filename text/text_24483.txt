BACKGROUND
mammalian taste buds are onion-shaped structures specialized for the detection of aqueous stimuli. based on morphological criteria, rodent taste cells have been classified into types i, ii, iii, peripheral and basal cells  <cit> . type i cells in rodents are slender and possess an electron-dense cytoplasm and several long, apical microvilli extending into the oral cavity. a distinguishing feature of a type i cell is the presence of many 100– <dig> nm dense granules in the apical cytoplasm. type ii cells are characterized by the presence of an electron-lucent cytoplasm and large circular or ovoid nuclei. type ii cells possess several short microvilli of uniform length extending into the taste pore. type iii cells are slender and exhibit morphology and cytoplasmic electron density intermediate between type i and type ii cells. the nuclei of type iii cells are slender and possess prominent invaginations. two distinguishing features of type iii cells are the single blunt microvillus that extends into the taste pore and the presence of synapses onto nerve processes  <cit> .

only recently are the functional differences of the cell types becoming understood. still, it is not clear which taste cell types are the receptors. based on the presence of synaptic foci, it was believed that type iii cells were the only taste bud receptor cells  <cit> . evidence that type ii cells are associated with transduction molecules, however, suggested a sensory for this cell type. for example, some type ii taste cells express the taste signaling molecules α-gustducin, plcβ <dig>  and the type iii ip <dig> receptor  in rat circumvallate taste buds  <cit> . it is significant, however, that type ii taste cells apparently lack classical synapses. likewise, some type iii taste cells display immunoreactivity to serotonin  in rat and mouse circumvallate taste buds  <cit> , neural cell adhesion molecule   <cit> , and synaptosome-associated protein of  <dig> kda  in rat circumvallate taste buds  <cit> . immunoreactivity to ubiquitin carboxyl terminase   <cit>  and the synaptobrevin- <dig>   <cit>  are both found in type ii and iii taste cells in rat circumvallate taste buds. a small percentage  of plcβ <dig> or ip3r <dig> immunoreactive cells also display 5-ht-lir. it is believed that plcβ <dig> or ip3r <dig> is also present in a small subset of type iii cells in rat circumvallate taste buds  <cit> . quantitation studies have demonstrated that approximately 24% of the taste cells in rat circumvallate papillae display α-gustducin-lir  <cit> , whereas another study showed that α-gustducin is present in 33% of taste cells in mouse circumvallate papillae  <cit> . pgp  <dig>  is present approximately in  <dig> % of the taste cells in rat circumvallate taste buds  <cit>  and 23% of taste cells in mouse circumvallate taste buds  <cit> . based on these preliminary data, it is likely that there are differences in cell type labeling between rats and mice.

many of the electrophysiological, ultrastructural, and immunocytochemical studies on rodent taste buds have been carried out on rat taste buds. in recent years, however, the mouse has become the species of choice for molecular and other studies on sensory transduction in taste buds. do rat and mouse taste buds have the same cell types, sensory transduction markers and synaptic proteins? recent research indicates that there are differences in electrophysiological properties, expression of markers and innervation between rat and mouse taste buds  <cit> . the acid-sensing ion channel- <dig>  is widely believed to be a receptor for acid taste in rat taste cells, however, asic- <dig> is not expressed in mouse taste cells and asic- <dig> knock-out mice exhibited normal physiological responses to acid taste stimuli  <cit> . asic- <dig> is an acid taste receptor in rat taste cells, but not in mouse taste cells. rat and mouse taste buds are innervated differently by peripheral taste neurons  <cit> . three to five ganglion cells innervate a single bud in mice while there is a more divergent innervation of buds in the rat  <cit> 

in the present study we have used antisera directed against plcβ <dig>  α-gustducin, 5-ht, pgp  <dig>  and synaptobrevin- <dig> to determine the percentages of taste cells expressing these markers in circumvallate taste buds of both rodent species. in addition we have determined the numerical density of taste cells and taste bud volume between rat and mouse circumvallate taste buds using serial transverse sections.

RESULTS
serotonin 
serotonin-lir is present in a small subset of taste cells in rodent taste buds. the animal is injected with the immediate precursor, 5-htp, according to the method of kim and roper  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that serotonin is present in a subset of type iii taste cells in rat and mouse circumvallate taste buds  <cit> . our results show that a small subset of slender taste cells display serotonin-like immunoreactivity  in both rat and mouse circumvallate taste buds.

immunoreactivity is present in both the cytoplasm and nuclei . a single taste bud profile contains approximately  <dig>  taste cells in rat and  <dig>  taste cells in mouse displaying serotonin immunoreactivity . we examined  <dig> taste buds from  <dig> rats and  <dig> taste buds from  <dig> mice. a total of  <dig> immunoreactive cells were found in the rat taste buds and  <dig> immunoreactive cells in the mouse taste buds were counted. there is a significant difference between rat  and mouse circumvallate taste buds  in the percentage of taste cells displaying serotonin-lir  .

pgp  <dig> 
subsets of taste cells and nerve processes in both rat and mouse circumvallate taste buds display pgp  <dig> -lir . three subsets of pgp  <dig> -lir nerve processes are present: intragemmal, perigemmal and extragemmal. intense immunoreactivity is associated with the nerve plexus located at the base of the taste bud. some pgp  <dig> -lir taste cells are slender, spindle-shaped cells with irregular nuclei, while others have large ovoid to round nuclei. whereas each taste bud profile in the rat contains approximately  <dig>  pgp  <dig> -lir taste cells, approximately  <dig> taste cells per taste bud profile are immunoreactive for pgp  <dig>  in the mouse . there is a significant difference  in the percentages of pgp  <dig>  immunoreactive taste cells between rat and mouse circumvallate taste buds. approximately  <dig> % of the taste cells in the mouse display pgp  <dig> -lir, while only  <dig> % taste cells in the rat exhibit pgp  <dig> -lir .

α-gustducin
α-gustducin is a g protein believed to be involved in the transduction pathways for bitter and sweet taste  <cit> . α-gustducin may also play a role in umami taste  <cit> . α-gustducin is present in a subset of type ii cells  <cit> . our results show that a subset of taste cells express α-gustducin-lir in both mouse and rat circumvallate taste buds. the α-gustducin-lir taste cells are spindle-shaped with large, round nuclei. immunoreactivity is cytoplasmic; no immunoreactivity is associated with the nuclei.

α-gustducin immunoreactive cells extend from the basal lamina to the taste pore . we analyzed  <dig> taste buds from five rats and  <dig> taste buds from ten mice. cells were scored as immunoreactive only if the cellular profile contained a nuclear profile. we observed  <dig> immunoreactive taste cells in the rat and  <dig> immunoreactive taste cells in mouse taste buds . approximately 18% of the taste cells in rat taste buds and  <dig> % of taste cells in mouse taste buds displayed α-gustducin-lir. the numbers of α-gustducin-lir immunoreactive taste cells in the rat were significantly different from those in the mouse  .

plcβ2
phospholipase cβ <dig>  is thought to be essential for the transduction of bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli  <cit> . a large subset of taste cells in both rat and mouse circumvallate taste buds display plcβ2-lir. the immunoreactive cells are spindle-shaped with round nuclei resembling type ii taste cells . we counted  <dig> plcβ2-lir cells from  <dig> rat taste buds and  <dig> plcβ2-lir cells from  <dig> mouse taste buds. whereas  <dig> % of rat circumvallate taste cells display plcβ2-lir, only  <dig> % of the mouse circumvallate taste cells display plcβ2-lir. thus, rat taste buds contain higher percentages of plcβ2-lir cells than mouse taste buds  .

synaptobrevin-2
synaptobrevin- <dig>  is a synaptic vesicle membrane protein that plays an important role in the exocytosis of neurotransmitter release at the synapse  <cit> . previous studies have shown that synaptobrevin-2-lir is present subsets of both type ii and type iii taste cells in rat taste buds  <cit> . synaptobrevin- <dig> is present in a large subset of taste cells and nerve processes in both rat and mouse circumvallate taste buds . approximately 35% of the cells in taste buds from rat circumvallate papillae display synaptobrevin-2-lir  <cit> . most of the immunoreactive taste cells are spindle shaped with circular to ovoid nuclei. a smaller subset of synaptobrevin-2-lir taste cells possessed cells that are slender in shape. we examined a total  <dig> taste buds from five rats and  <dig> taste buds from ten mice. we found  <dig> taste cells displaying synaptobrevin-2-lir in rat circumvallate taste buds, and  <dig> taste cells displaying synaptobrevin-2-lir in mouse circumvallate taste buds . there is a significantly higher percentage of taste cells displaying immunoreactivity to synaptobrevin- <dig> in rat circumvallate taste buds versus mouse taste buds  .

numerical density of taste cells
forty-one taste buds from  <dig> mice and  <dig> taste buds from  <dig> rats were analyzed . mouse taste buds contain an average of  <dig>  taste cells  vs  <dig>  taste cells  in rat taste buds. the numbers of cells per taste bud ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in the mouse and  <dig> to  <dig> in the rat. although the average mouse taste bud contains more taste cells than a rat taste bud, the average volume of a mouse taste bud  is smaller than a rat taste bud . the numerical density of taste cells in mouse circumvallate taste buds  is significantly higher than that in the rat .

discussion
in the present study we have demonstrated that significant differences exist between rats and mice with regard to the presence of signaling molecules and taste bud cell markers. using unbiased systematic sampling and immunocytochemistry we have quantified the presence of signaling molecules/taste cell markers including serotonin, pgp  <dig> , α-gustducin, phospholipase c β <dig>  and synaptobrevin- <dig>  our results indicate that there are significant differences  between mouse and rat taste buds in the percentages of taste cells displaying immunoreactivity  for all five markers. higher percentages of rat taste bud cells exhibit immunoreactivity to α-gustducin, plcβ <dig> and synaptobrevin- <dig> compared with the mouse. mouse taste buds however, contain higher percentages of taste cells displaying serotonin- and pgp  <dig> -lir.

serotonin
serotonin is a putative neurotransmitter or neuromodulator candidate in the taste bud  <cit> . previous studies have suggested that serotonin is present in type iii taste cells in rat, rabbit, and mouse taste buds  <cit> . yee et al.  <cit>  proposed that the type iii cells in rat circumvallate taste buds are two of varieties: those immunoreactive for serotonin and those immunoreactive for pgp  <dig> . taste bud synapses in rat circumvallate taste buds are only associated with the type iii cells  <cit> . our quantitation results indicate there is a significant difference  in the percentages of taste cells displaying serotonin-lir between mouse and rat circumvallate taste buds:  <dig> % of mouse taste cells contain serotonin compared with  <dig> % of rat taste bud cells. based on previous work from our laboratory, we believe that serotonin-lir colocalizes with snap-25-lir in taste cells of rat taste buds  <cit> .

pgp  <dig> 
pgp   <dig>  is a neuronal marker that has also been found in certain types of paraneurons  <cit> . pgp  <dig> -lir has been identified in taste buds of the rat  <cit> . previously we found pgp  <dig> -lir in subsets of both type ii and type iii cells in circumvallate taste buds of the rat  <cit> . we also observed synapses onto nerve processes from pgp  <dig> -lir type iii taste cells. whereas one subset of type iii cells in the rat accumulate serotonin but do not express pgp  <dig> , the remainder of the type iii cells express pgp  <dig>  but do not accumulate serotonin. similarly, two subsets of type ii cells exist: those immunoreactive for pgp  <dig>  and those immunoreactive for α-gustducin. our results indicate that  <dig> % of taste cells express pgp  <dig>  in mouse, while  <dig> % display pgp  <dig> -lir in rat. thus, the pgp  <dig> -lir subsets of type ii and type iii cells may constitute small percentages of those cell types. it would be of benefit for future studies to elucidate the percentages of these subsets of type ii and type iii cells.

α-gustducin and plcβ2
α-gustducin and plcβ <dig> are believed to participate in bitter, sweet and umami taste transduction  <cit> . α-gustducin knockout mice show markedly reduced behavioral and electrophysiological responses to both bitter and sweet compounds  <cit> . we have demonstrated that all α-gustducin immunoreactive cells and most plcβ2-immunoreactive taste cells are type ii taste cells. a small percentage  of plcβ2-immunoreactive taste cells appear to be type iii cells  <cit> . virtually all α-gustducin-lir taste cells display plcβ2-lir, while only a subset of plcβ2-immunoreactive taste cells display α-gustducin-lir  <cit> . the percentages of α-gustducin- and plcβ2-lir taste cells in rat circumvallate taste buds  are higher than those in mouse .

synaptobrevin-2
synaptobrevin- <dig> is a vesicle-associated membrane protein. previous results from our laboratory indicate that synaptobrevin- <dig> is present in a subset of type ii and type iii cells. our data suggest that taste cells with synapses express synaptobrevin- <dig>  <cit> . in rat circumvallate taste buds, a large subset of synaptobrevin-2-lir cells  also express ip3r <dig>  <cit> . most all ip3r <dig> immunoreactive cells have been shown to be type ii cells  <cit> . in the present study we have found that a greater percentage of rat taste cells display immunoreactivity for synaptobrevin- <dig> versus the mouse . likewise, rats have a larger percentage of taste cells expressing α-gustducin and plcβ <dig>  these findings suggest that proportionally there are more type ii cells in rat circumvallate papillae taste buds when compared with mouse. although type ii taste cells lack classical synapses, we do find that the type ii taste cells contain some vesicles in the cytoplasm. the function of synaptobrevin- <dig> in type ii taste cells is unclear, however, it suggests that synaptobrevin- <dig> may play a role in vesicle protein transportation, perhaps in the golgi apparatus.

several investigators have used different immunohistochemical methods to quantify taste cells displaying α-gustducin or pgp  <dig>  in rodent animals. ueda et al.  <cit>  used the avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase  method and concluded that approximately  <dig> % of rat circumvallate papillae taste bud cells display α-gustducin-lir and  <dig> % display pgp  <dig> -lir. the results in that study were based on  <dig> taste cells in  <dig> taste buds. this contrasts with our results from the rat . this disparity may be due to: 1) the number of taste buds we sampled ; 2) our use of unbiased sampling; 3) specimen preparation techniques, e.g., the use of different fixatives; 4) immunocytochemical imaging methods e.g., abc method vs immunofluorescence. smith et al.  <cit>  reported that rat circumvallate taste buds have a mean of  <dig>  α-gustducin-lir cells per taste bud. takeda et al.  <cit>  found α-gustducin-lir in 33% and pgp  <dig> -lir in 23% of mouse circumvallate taste bud cells. we account for the difference in our results for the following reasons: 1) we used unbiased systematic sampling in our study; 2) we analyzed over  <dig> taste buds for each antibody; 3) in our study, taste cells were counted as immunoreactive only when a nuclear profile was present; 4) we counted immunoreactive taste cells using transverse sections versus longitudinal sections. in the transverse sections, there is no overlapping in taste cells, the immunoreactive taste cell profiles are obvious, and nuclei are easier to count. takeda et al.  <cit>  used polyclonal pgp  <dig>  antibody in their study while we used a monoclonal pgp  <dig>  antibody. however, our experience with polyclonal pgp  <dig>   is that it completely colocalizes in taste cells and nerve processes with monoclonal pgp  <dig>  antibody . finally, we conclude that a higher percentage of rat taste cells express α-gustducin  than in the mouse ; while a smaller percentage of rat taste cells express pgp  <dig>   versus the mouse .

numerical density and size of taste buds
it is generally accepted that a rodent taste bud contains  <dig> –  <dig> taste cells. we were curious to determine if there are differences in the numbers of cells in circumvallate taste buds between the rat and mouse. our results clearly demonstrate that mouse taste buds are smaller in volume, but contain a larger number of smaller taste cells when compared with rat.

CONCLUSIONS
we have provided evidence that the rat and mouse differ in the percentages of taste cells expressing each of five taste signaling molecules: serotonin, pgp  <dig> , α-gustducin, plcβ <dig> and synaptobrevin- <dig>  these results, taken together with the differences taste cell size and numbers, suggest that rats and mice may possess different sensitivities to gustatory stimuli.
