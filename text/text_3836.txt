BACKGROUND
the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas, is a filter feeder bivalve mollusc which is continually exposed to microorganisms naturally present in the marine environment. thus, the capacity to control the microflora and overcome infections is essential for the oyster survival. the hemocytes, immunocompetent cells, play a central role in innate antimicrobial response. indeed, in molluscs, hemocytes infiltrate injured tissues, phagocyte microorganisms, produce antimicrobial peptides  and release factors such as lectins and reactive oxygen species   <cit> .

in c. gigas, several antimicrobial effectors have been recently characterized. an amp, member of the defensin family named cg-defm, was identified from the oyster mantle  <cit> . then, two additional defensins named cg-defhs have been characterized from hemocytes  <cit> . both cg-defm and cg-defhs appear to be continuously expressed in different tissues. more recently, a new peptide, cg-prp, which belongs to the proline-rich amp family, has been found in hemocytes  <cit> . whereas cg-prp displays alone a weak in vitro antimicrobial activity, it revealed synergistic activity with cg-defm against both gram positive and negative bacteria  <cit> . additionally, a member of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein  family has been characterized  <cit> . cg-bpi expression is induced in hemocytes after oyster bacterial challenge and constitutive in various tissue epithelia of unchallenged oysters. similar to vertebrate bpis, the oyster bpi binds lps, displays bactericidal activity against gram negative bacteria and increases the permeability of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> .

high levels of sequence diversity were reported to be a characteristic of several antimicrobial effectors pertaining to the innate immunity system of invertebrates  <cit> . the functional significance of this diversity has been addressed in some cases. multiple variants of lectins from the horseshoe crab carcinoscorpius rotundicauda are able to recognize and differentiate bacteria and fungi  <cit> . the amp drosomycin from drosophila melanogaster presents six isoforms with different antifungal activities  <cit> . thus, diversification of antimicrobial effectors by accumulation of multiple variations around an originally unique form may provide significant means of acquiring microbial target specificity  <cit> , concerned in the evolutionary arms race between pathogens and their hosts.

in this work, we have investigated the diversity of three oyster antimicrobial effectors and shown the existence of a high diversity in the transcript and genomic sequences of three antimicrobials, two peptides  and one protein . we also evidence distinct phylogenies between them and propose the existence of a combination of different genetic mechanisms from which sequence variability arises.

RESULTS
c. gigas antimicrobial peptides and bpi protein show distinct phylogeny conformations
to characterize the diversity of all the genes, i.e. the two antimicrobial peptides cg-defs and cg-prp, the antimicrobial protein cg-bpi and the non immune gene cg-actin, we performed an exhaustive sequencing of cloned pcr products and collected sequences in the sigenae database http://www.sigenae.org/. finally, we got a total of  <dig> cdna sequences and  <dig> gdna sequences that we aligned and used to build phylogenies . alignments are available as popset in genbank; cdna sequences of cg-prp, cg-defs, cg-bpi and cg-actin: fj669353-fj <dig>  fj669323-fj <dig>  fj669296-fj <dig>  fj669287-fj <dig> respectively and gdna sequences of cg-prp and cg-defs: fj669252-fj <dig> and fj669403-fj <dig> respectively. we obtained for both amps, cg-prp and cg-defs, clearly structured phylogenies where sequences clustered in distinct groups, whereas cg-bpi and cg-actin sequences formed star-like phylogenies instead . on this basis, we identified three distinct and more or less distant groups of cg-defs , each one composed by multiple variants of cg-defh <dig>  cg-defh <dig> and cg-defm, respectively.

pi: nucleotide diversity

furthermore, we uncovered two lengths of transcripts for cg-defm, one corresponding to the coding sequence  of  <dig> bp previously described  <cit>  and a longer one identified here for the first time with a cds of  <dig> bp. similarly, we identified two lengths of transcripts for cg-prp, the one already described with a cds of  <dig> bp  <cit>  and a novel shorter one with an indel of  <dig> nucleotides in the c-terminal region. likewise to cg-defs, cg-prp sequences are distributed into three different groups . group i is only composed of short sequences, group ii of long and short sequences, while group iii contained only two long and highly divergent sequences. in addition, whenever we got genomic sequences, they are evenly distributed in every group. in contrast to both amps, only one group of sequences and homogeneous sequence lengths were obtained for cg-bpi  and cg-actin .

the four genes were compared considering the total nucleotide diversity  from all identified sequences for each gene, their haplotype diversity  and the mean number of single nucleotide polymorphism  in the coding region. comparison between these values gave evidence of different constraint forces acting on each gene . besides, the average density of snps identified for cg-actin was in agreement with snp values estimated for the genome of c. gigas of one snp every  <dig> bp, also characterised by direct sequencing of pcr products of several genes  <cit> .

additionally, the comparison of mean nucleotide diversity  and the mean nucleotide divergence between groups of each amp showed that cg-prp presents more diverse but less divergent groups compared to cg-defs. cg-prp presents pi values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  within group i, ii and iii, respectively, whereas cg-defs groups present lower pi values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  within group i, ii and iii, respectively. interestingly, cg-defh <dig>  appears to be highly conserved as compared to cg-defh <dig> . cg-bpi and cg-actin, which both yield an unstructured phylogeny, present a pi of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

besides, values of mean nucleotide divergences between groups of amps show a higher divergence of cg-defs groups compared to cg-prp ones. cg-defs present mean divergence values of  <dig>  between group i and ii;  <dig>  between group i and iii and  <dig>  between group ii and iii, while cg-prp present lower values of  <dig>  between group i and ii;  <dig>  between group i and iii and  <dig>  between group ii and iii. this phylogenetic analysis indicates that cg-defm is definitively distinct from cg-defhs. we then separate cg-defm and cg-defhs for further polymorphism analysis.

antimicrobial peptides are encoded by multigene families with different gene structures
the evidence of different groups revealed by amp phylogenies and the number of genomic sequence variants found in one single individual strongly suggest the existence of multiple gene copies. we have therefore estimated the gene copy number of the four molecules analysed in this study. the gene copy number estimation on  <dig> individuals revealed that cg-prp and cg-defs are both represented by a high number of copies with mean values of  <dig> and  <dig> copies, respectively. it must be noticed that the primers used for this quantification did not allow the distinction between the different defensins. thus, this value represents the sum of cg-defhs and cg-defm copies. in contrast, cg-bpi is found as a single copy gene. cg-actin is represented by a higher copy number , and as for cg-defs and cg-prp, its number of copies varies among the three oysters analysed .

because both cg-defs and cg-prp amps are present as multigene families, we also characterized their gene structure by exhaustive gdna sequencing from one individual. the genomic organization of cg-prp and cg-defs revealed two different structures for cg-prp and one single structure for cg-defs . the two structures of cg-prp correspond either to genes with or without an intron, both arrangements coding for the long and short peptide variants. all cg-prp genes containing the intron have the same exonic organization. exon  <dig> contains the sequence encoding the signal peptide and half of the residues of the anionic domain  while exon  <dig> encodes the end of the anionic domain and the cationic domain region  . nevertheless, we identified several indel events between introns of long and short variants. in addition, intron sequences of short cg-prp variants showed length variations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and multiple snps. in contrast to cg-prp, we found a single genomic structure for cg-defs. exon  <dig> contains the sequence encoding part of the signal peptide  and exon  <dig> encodes the remaining part of the signal peptide region and the mature peptide region , except for the last two residues encoded by exon  <dig>  . however, no homology was found between intron sequences of cgdefm and cg-defhs, confirming thus the very ancient divergence time between the two lineages of these genes. moreover, introns between cg-defm and cg-defhs differ by length variations. cg-defs and cg-prp amp genes contain canonical gt/ag splicing recognition sequence located at the end of each intron.

antimicrobial peptides and protein variants are produced by several mechanisms of diversification
the cdna and gdna sequence diversity and the variable gene copy number observed between c. gigas families of antimicrobials prompted us to investigate the genetic processes that participated to the diversification. thus, we analyzed the repartition of synonymous and non synonymous substitutions in each group from amp phylogenies . each group of cg-defs presents a specific distribution of substitutions all along the cds . thus, cg-defh <dig> is the most overall conserved antimicrobial peptide, with only a few numbers of substitutions. cg-defh <dig>  in contrast, presents a high number of synonymous substitutions and cg-defm presents a profile which differs from hemocyte defensins with higher number of nonsynonymous substitutions. cg-prp shows a different profile compared to cg-defs in terms of the distribution of substitutions. indeed, the substitutions localized in the signal and anionic peptide region are shared by groups, while substitutions in the cationic peptide region are specific of each group . altogether, these results show the existence of different constraint levels between and within the groups of amps .

sequence alignments gave also evidence of several genetic mechanisms of diversification such as recombination and parallel mutations leading to phylogenetic homoplasy. clues of recombination were detected by the visual inspection of alignments and by the construction of cladograms using different domains of each antimicrobial  that lead to inconsistent clustering of sequences: several sequences of cg-defhs, cg-prp and cg-bpi moving from one clade to another according to the domain used, suggesting past recombination events between members of different groups. we then calculated the minimum number of recombination events  for all genes. cg-defhs, cg-prp and cg-bpi showed rm values of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in contrast, we did not find any evidence of recombination for cg-defm and cg-actin. because of the large difference in size between our genes and since the probability of recombination is proportional to the length of each sequence, we calculated a ratio of rm/cds length for a correct comparison between amps and cg-bpi protein. the ratios of rm/cds length for cg-defhs, cg-prp and cg-bpi were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> Ã 10- <dig> respectively, which gave evidence of a higher probability in amps to present recombination between alleles compared to cg-bpi.

in addition to the increase in the gene copy number described above, other processes that participate in amp diversification are indel events which produce length variations in the cds. long variants of cg-defm are obtained by an indel of two nucleotides at the 3'end  which changes the open reading frame and generates a longer molecule of  <dig> nucleotides, coding for a peptide of  <dig> amino acids with eight extra amino acids compared to the original form. for cg-prp, the two lengths are generated by an indel of six nucleotides near the 3'end , corresponding to a repetition of the precedent nucleotides. these forms code for peptides of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids.

antimicrobial peptides and protein show a great number of variants and amp diversity is shaped by directional selection pressure
from all sequences analyzed in this study, we identified  <dig> variants of cg-prp,  <dig> variants of cg-bpi,  <dig> variants of cg-defm,  <dig> variants of cg-defhs and only  <dig> variants of cg-actin. thus, we then analyzed if the sequence diversity has been shaped by directional selection pressures. the ratios of non synonymous to synonymous substitutions  for each codon of the four molecules indicate several sites under negative and positive selection for both amps , but not for cg-bpi and cg-actin . to obtain dn/ds ratios, we first excluded all obvious recombinant sequences. then, to assess the significance of the findings, we carried out a likelihood ratio test  and considered only codons showing significantly negative and positive selection . ten and  <dig> residues showing significant negative selection were identified in cg-defs and cg-prp respectively. for both amps, we detected a lower number of positively selected sites .

in cg-defs, the signal peptide is well conserved for each class of defensin. besides, the cleavage site for signal peptidase and the position of the cysteines is completely conserved in all variants . we identified a high number of amino acid substitutions between cg-defs and several substitutions occurring in the mature peptide which change the physicochemical properties of the encoded amino acid. thus, the polarity and/or charge of amino acids are modified in sites  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . in contrast, substitutions occurring in the signal peptide do not modify the physico-chemical properties of the encoded amino acid. interestingly, long forms of cg-defm present two extra positive charged amino acids in position  <dig> and  <dig>  and one extra negative charged amino acid in position  <dig> .

in cg-prp, the signal peptide is the most variable region and the cleavage site is completely conserved among all variants, but the putative chymotrypsin cleavage site between the anionic and cationic domain presents an amino acid variation in position  <dig>  . although this mutation is found in both long and short variants, the chymotrypsin cleavage site remained unchanged. amino acid substitutions are identified in both signal and mature peptide region and they mainly concern the polarity of residues, like sites  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . we also found complex sites with four and six different amino acid substitutions per site in which polarity and charge are modified, like sites  <dig>  and  <dig> .

discussion
our results showed the existence of high and variable sequence diversity of c. gigas antimicrobial peptides  and protein , produced by a combination of different genetic mechanisms. phylogenetic trees constructed with cds from transcripts and genomic sequences showed a distinct phylogeny shape for each gene. the antimicrobial protein cg-bpi expressed in hemocytes presents higher number of variants compared to non immune gene cg-actin, but it is less diverse than amps. in contrast to both amps, cg-bpi variants fall into one single group encoded by one single gene copy, being in accordance with the one copy present in human  <cit> . thus, the sequence diversity observed for cg-bpi results from allelic polymorphism only, with occasional recombination between alleles at a lower frequency when compared to amps. though sequences obtained by pcr approach come from relatively limited sample size  but with a large spectrum of oyster origin and challenge conditions, the sequence sampling saturation curve  have a sigmoid shape indicating that sequencing effort was sufficient in our population to approach the plateau of saturation for each gene . furthermore, we have complemented the sample size by adding all the c. gigas ests available in databases. these ests come from more than  <dig> cdna libraries  retrieved in the last decade. the combination of these two distinct sources of sequences is probably not exhaustive but covers a large enough range of variants to give a good insight of the overall polymorphism of the genes.

cg-prp, which is expressed only in hemocytes, presents the highest number of transcript variants that are distributed into three groups. this partitioned phylogeny results in part from group specific mutations affecting only the cationic region. these key mutations in the potential active domain have segregated into two major lineages that are further diversified on other sites. there, high polymorphism in signal peptide and anionic region induces high sequence diversity within each group. interestingly, we observed two very divergent sequences forming a third distinct group. such a long branch in the phylogeny leading to few sequences may be indicative of an ongoing or recent process of neo-functionalization or subfunctionalization. these kinds of phenomena are often invoked in the course of evolution of duplicate genes  <cit> , here supported by the finding of multiple copies for cg-prp. in addition to this, sequence polymorphism of cg-prp is produced by recombination and convergent mutations leading to phylogenetic homoplasy. besides, cg-prp is encoded by a lower number of copies than cg-defs but shows higher number of different transcripts, indicating that allelic polymorphism associated with higher recombination frequency is important for this antimicrobial effector. noticeably, intronless genes were found for cg-prp as previously described in other organisms where it was demonstrated to accelerate mrna maturation process  <cit> . on the opposite, intron presence was also described to have positive effect on transcript stability  <cit> . nevertheless, the role of different genomic structures and its correlation with the antimicrobial function remains unclear.

cg-defs expressed in hemocytes and mantle tissue exhibit the highest divergence between groups but a lower diversity within each one. moreover, each cg-defs group displays different conservation level, showing that cg-defh <dig> is less diversified than cg-defh <dig>  cg-defm and even cg-actin. since we collected the different cg-defs in the same conditions, we can rule out a technical bias inducing a highly redundant sequencing of the same molecule cg-defh <dig> and leading to a skewed appreciation of the relative variability of each group. thus, two major hypotheses could explain this extremely low level of variability:  cg-defh <dig> appeared recently and is not yet diversified albeit frequent in the genome we explored, or  cg-defh <dig> could be an older variant but have undergone strong selective pressure. there is no apparent reason why cg-defh <dig> could be more under selective constraints than the other cg-defs. so the polymorphism reduction it displays is more likely due to a recent selective sweep than to purifying selection acting in a long term manner. we can postulate that this selective sweep could be consecutive to infections by pathogens that cg-defh <dig> was particularly effective to combat. in addition, the fact that cg-actin also appears more polymorphic at nucleotide level than cg-defh <dig> is also in favour of a selective sweep on cg-defh <dig>  since it indicates that the polymorphism reduction concerns both the synonymous and the non-synonymous sites while purifying selection would affect mainly non-synonymous mutations. however, further studies are needed to clarify this point.

cg-defs also present recombination parallel homoplasic events and a multigene family as observed for cg-prp. nevertheless, the absence of recombination between cg-defm and cgdefhs, together with the lack of homology between their introns, indicates that these two lineages are separated for a longer time than cg-prp. this could be associated with the tissue specific expression of cg-defm  <cit>  and cg-defhs  <cit>  probably acquired after a duplication event followed by sub-functionalization. the tissue specific expression has already been described for several amps like mice Î±-defensins, which might be linked to differences in innate immune functions  <cit> . likewise, sequence diversification of amps by gene duplication has been reported for vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> .

it is remarkable that gene duplication, as well as strong selective pressure , did not affect identically the genes that we have studied; the antimicrobial peptides,cg-defs and cg-prp, have been a target for both, while antimicrobial protein cg-bpi was not. this may reflect a difference in the way these two types of molecules participate in the immune response.

concerning the sites under selection, the sites subject to purification found for both amps correspond to residues under strong functional constraints. in cg-defs, seven of eight cys residues are under negative selection and cys residues are known to be essential for the antimicrobial function of these peptides  <cit> . in cg-prp, the conserved pro-arg motif has been involved in antimicrobial activity of this class of amps  <cit>  and the conserved c-terminal gly is expected to be eliminated, obtaining a c-terminally amidated peptide which would increase its cationic properties  <cit> .

in addition to these constrained sites, sites subject to diversifying selection of the amps could also have a role in antimicrobial function. in cg-defs, positively selected sites concern the modification of the charge and/or polarity of certain amino acids, and these changes could probably affect the affinity of the peptides to bacterial membranes. this finding is in accordance with several sites in human beta-defensin  <dig>  in which amino acid charge is directly involved in the antimicrobial activity  <cit> . in cg-prp, from all positively selected sites, we identified a site in the active domain where a change of a pro toward a gln occurred. because the activity of proline-rich amps  <cit>  relies of course on proline residues, the functional characterization of these variants in terms of efficiency could help in understanding their role in the antimicrobial response. the functional significance of other positively and negatively sites along the coding region of cg-defs and cg-prp remains unknown and needs further investigation. nevertheless, we propose, following several authors  <cit>  that strong selective pressures on amps are directed toward the acquisition of novel microbial target specificities.

evidence for directional selection driving evolution has been addressed in several cases  <cit>  and it is consistent with the general hypothesis of co-evolution or "arms race"  <cit> . in this hypothesis, the pathogen evolves continuously to escape from the immune response of host and, consequently, the immune system of host evolves to improve barriers against pathogens. thus, such interactions might provide rapid evolution in genes concerned in host-pathogen interactions. the emergence of cg-defh <dig>  a form of cg-defhs that seems to have largely spread out in the oysters we analyzed, could be a good illustration of this.

besides the sites under directional pressures, both amps show different lengths of mature peptide which could modify their antimicrobial activities. in one hand, cg-defm long variants present a longer c-terminal tail with eight extra amino acid residues that could influence the affinity to the bacterial membranes. indeed, different c-terminal tails of alpha-defensins from rat are already described and are predicted to be exposed to the surface where they might confer a different antimicrobial spectrum  <cit> . on the other hand, the two lengths of cg-prpare produced by an indel of an arg-pro motif in the cationic domain, which is described to be involved in the antimicrobial activity of proline rich amps  <cit> . all these differences between antimicrobial effectors could be related to specific antimicrobial functions and result from co-evolution between host and pathogen species.

CONCLUSIONS
all these data support the hypothesis that oysters, continuously exposed to an environment rich in microorganisms, have developed specific strategies of innate immunity to increase the antimicrobial defense upon infection through effector diversification. in addition, considering the synergistic activities already reported between the two amps, cg-prp and cg-defm,  <cit>  and between several isoforms of the same amp in other species  <cit> , the observed diversity could also improve the antimicrobial response through synergic activities. the next step of our work is now to establish the functional significance of this diversity.
