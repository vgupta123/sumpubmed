BACKGROUND
mutations in the constitutive expressor of pathogenesis-related genes <dig>  gene of arabidopsis thaliana are highly pleiotropic, affecting pathogen responses, cell proliferation, cell expansion, and senescence. the gene was initially identified based on the constitutive pathogen response phenotype of the mutants  <cit> , and appears to act just downstream of pathogen recognition and upstream of salicylic acid in npr1-dependent disease resistance  <cit> . in addition, boch and co-workers  <cit>  showed that cpr <dig> activates pathogenesis-related  gene expression in the rps2-mediated pathway and not the rpm1-mediated pathway. however, cpr <dig> appears to play a broader role in plant growth and development as well, because cpr <dig> mutants exhibit defects in cell proliferation and cell expansion, and the gene has been hypothesized to play a role in programmed cell death  <cit> . in addition, cpr <dig> mutants are hyper-responsive to glucose and sucrose and prematurely accumulate senescence-regulated transcripts  <cit> . the cpr <dig> gene encodes a putative membrane protein with five putative transmembrane domains at the carboxy-terminus, a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal at the amino-terminus, and no sequence similarity to other known proteins  <cit> .

in contrast to other constitutive pathogen response mutants, cpr <dig> mutations affect trichome morphology. the trichomes on arabidopsis leaves are specialized single cells that project from the epidermis, and in wild-type they have an unusual branched shape. in addition, wild-type trichomes replicate their dna without division during development in a process called endoreplication or endoreduplication, reaching nuclear dna levels of 16c-32c  <cit> . trichomes of cpr <dig> mutants are smaller and less branched than those of wild-type, and have a lower nuclear dna content  <cit> . this trichome phenotype suggests that, unlike other constitutive pathogen response mutants, cpr <dig> may play a more specific role in trichome development.

arabidopsis trichomes are used as a model of plant cell differentiation and cell biology  <cit> , and the control of early trichome development is well-understood. initiation of trichome development requires a transcription factor complex consisting of the basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor glabra <dig> , the myb transcription factor glabra <dig> , and the wd-repeat protein transparent testa glabra . mutations in these genes result either in the absence of trichomes, or in reduced numbers of trichomes, and interactions among these proteins have been demonstrated in yeast. the triptychon  protein acts as a negative regulator of trichome development, and is thought to prevent neighboring cells from developing as trichomes by diffusing to neighboring cells via plasmodesmata and inhibiting trichome development in a classic lateral inhibition mechanism. try has a myb dna-binding domain, but lacks a transcription activation domain, and can bind to gl <dig> in yeast, suggesting that it directly inhibits function of the gl1/gl3/ttg complex in cells neighboring a developing trichome  <cit> .

several mutants affect endoreplication levels in trichomes, and these mutants reveal that nuclear dna content, trichome size, and trichome branching are highly correlated, with mutants resulting in higher dna contents generally having trichomes that are larger and more branched  <cit> . among the genes that control the degree of trichome expansion and endoreplication are the trichome cell fate regulators themselves. endoreplication is reduced in gl <dig> loss-of-function mutants, and these mutants have smaller trichomes with reduced branching, while try mutants have increased levels of trichome endoreplication, and increase trichome size and branching  <cit> . trichomes of plants containing the gain-of-function gl3-sst allele also have large, extra-branched trichomes with enlarged nuclei indicative of an increased dna content  <cit> . these observations indicate that gl <dig> is required for continued trichome development beyond initiation, and that try acts within developing trichomes to limit the extent of expansion and endoreplication, in addition to its role in preventing neighboring cells from developing as trichomes.

to gain insight into the function of cpr <dig>  we examined the role of this gene in the context of the well-understood pathway for trichome development. here, we show that cpr <dig> mutants have altered cell walls with a reduced cellulose content in leaves as well as in trichomes, a previously unrecognized aspect of the phenotype. we also find that cpr <dig> mutations are epistatic to the extra expansion of trichome cells conditioned by either gl <dig> gain-of function and try loss-of-function. the cpr <dig> mutations also increase the number of adjacent trichomes formed due to failure of lateral inhibition signaling in try mutants. our work indicates that the pleiotropy of cpr <dig> mutants is due to a primary role for the gene product in a general cellular process such as cell wall biogenesis or integrity that impinges on many cellular pathways, rather than a specific role in pathogen response signaling or senescence.

RESULTS
mutant phenotype
two recessive alleles were used in this study, cpr5- <dig>  <cit>  and cpr5- <dig>  <cit> . as described previously by others, the overall size of cpr <dig> mutant plants was smaller than wild-type, cotyledons of cpr <dig> plants senesce sooner than those of wild-type, lesions are present on cpr <dig> rosette leaves, and both leaf epidermal cell size and cell number were greatly reduced in comparison with wild-type  <cit> . for all aspects of the phenotype, cpr5- <dig> plants have a more severe mutant phenotype than cpr5- <dig> mutant plants. the cpr5- <dig> mutation is a missense mutation in the fourth exon , and the cpr5- <dig> mutation creates a premature stop in the fourth exon at codon  <dig>  of greatest relevance to this work, trichome branching and size were reduced in plants homozygous for either cpr <dig> allele . for cpr5- <dig> homozygotes, more than 60% of the trichomes were unbranched, essentially the same fraction of unbranched trichomes that was reported by kirik et al.  <cit>  for the strong cpr5-t <dig> allele, indicating that cpr5- <dig> results in a loss of function comparable to that of the strongest characterized alleles.

for each genotype, branches on a minimum of  <dig> trichomes were counted.

cpr <dig> mutants have an altered cell wall
trichomes of cpr <dig> mutants were more transparent than those of wild-type, and appeared glassy, suggesting that the trichome cell wall of the mutants differed from wild-type trichome cell walls. one readily observable property of plant cell walls is the birefringence they exhibit in polarized light due to the presence of paracrystalline cellulose, a major component of plant cell walls. paracrystalline cellulose contributes to the high degree of birefringence observed in wild-type trichome cell walls  <cit> . this birefringence depends on the orientation of the sample relative to the plane of polarization of the illuminating light.

we examined wild-type and cpr <dig> trichomes by polarized light microscopy. as expected, wild-type trichomes were highly birefringent, indicated by transmission of light when a trichome branch was oriented appropriately relative to the plane of polarization , whereas cpr5- <dig> trichomes showed little detectable birefringence , and cpr5- <dig> trichomes exhibited reduced birefringence . quantitative comparison between the maximum amount of transmitted light  and minimum amount of transmitted light  as the specimen was rotated revealed a  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold difference for wild-type trichomes, a  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold difference for cpr5- <dig> trichomes, and a  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold difference for cpr5- <dig> trichomes.

several other mutants with transparent "glassy" trichomes have been described  <cit> . for the best characterized of these, trichome birefringence , reduced birefringence of trichome cell walls was associated with reduced paracrystalline cellulose in leaves  <cit> . as determined by the chemical method of updegraff  <cit> , there was significantly less paracrystalline cellulose in the walls of cpr5- <dig> rosette leaves , with walls of the mutant containing approximately 38% of the paracrystalline cellulose of wild-type walls . the cell wall monosaccharide composition of rosette leaf cell walls was also determined. no qualitative differences were found, though small increases in xylose  and arabinose  were observed in cpr5- <dig> relative to wild-type . the thickness of cell walls between adjoining epidermal cells of cpr5- <dig> and wild-type was directly examined by tem. the cpr5- <dig> mutant was found to have slightly but significantly thinner walls than wild-type .

genetic interactions between cpr <dig> and genes involved in trichome initiation
to gain further insight into the role of cpr <dig> in trichome development, cpr5- <dig> and cpr5- <dig> mutants were crossed with mutant plants for the trichome developmental regulator try, which has effects on trichome size, branching, and endoreplication opposite those of cpr <dig> mutants. the try gene encodes a myb protein that acts as an inhibitor of trichome development. the mutation in the try-jc allele used here results in a protein truncated in the middle of the conserved myb dna-domain  <cit> , and is phenotypically a strong loss-of-function allele.

trichomes of try-jc plants are larger and more branched than those of wild-type plants, and highly birefringent . in contrast, the trichomes of double mutant cpr5- <dig> try-jc and cpr5- <dig> try-jc plants are similar in size to those of corresponding cpr <dig> allele , indicating that cpr <dig> is epistatic to try with regard to trichome size. the reduced dna content of cpr <dig> trichome nuclei is also clearly epistatic to the increased dna content of try-jc trichome nuclei .

rfu = relative fluorescence units. s.d. = standard deviation. n = number of nuclei examined. rfu values have been normalized to  <dig>  the expected value for trichome nuclei of the wild-type col strain, and thus rfu values should roughly correspond to dna contents. a kruskal-wallis one way anova indicated that differences in the medians were greater than expected by chance ; an all pairwise multiple comparison  indicated that all pairwise comparisons were significantly different  except cpr5- <dig> vs. cpr5- <dig> try-jc and cpr5- <dig> vs. cpr5- <dig> try-jc.

unlike the trichomes of wild-type plants, try trichomes often occurred in clusters of immediately adjacent trichomes due to failure of lateral inhibition signaling . like wild-type trichomes, trichomes on cpr <dig> mutant leaves only rarely occurred in clusters . trichomes of the cpr <dig> try double mutants frequently occur in clusters , indicating that cpr <dig> was not epistatic to this aspect of the try phenotype. however, closer inspection revealed an unexpected synthetic genetic interaction whereby the cpr <dig> mutations increased the number of trichomes in each trichome cluster above that seen for try-jc alone . the percentage of trichomes in clusters on cpr5- <dig> try-jc and cpr5- <dig> try-jc leaves was approximately double the percentage on try-jc leaves . this difference was due primarily to an increase in the number of trichomes in each cluster for each of the cpr <dig> try double mutants relative to try-jc , which averaged nearly three trichomes per cluster, compared to two trichomes per cluster in the try-jc single mutant .

tis = trichome initiation site; a site on the leaf where one or more contiguous trichomes originate. all trichomes were counted on 10– <dig> first leaves per genotype.

plants expressing the trichome developmental regulator gl <dig> from the strong and relatively trichome-specific gl <dig> promoter  had large, highly birefringent trichomes with increased branching , similar to try-jc trichomes. plants of the genotype cpr5- <dig> progl2:gl <dig> have small trichomes similar to those of cpr5- <dig> plants , indicating that cpr <dig> is also epistatic to the increased trichome size conditioned by this construct. wild-type plants containing the progl2:gl <dig> construct also endoreplicate trichome nuclear dna to very high levels, on the order of ten times that of wild-type . the cpr5- <dig> progl2:gl <dig> double mutant has a dna content similar to that of the cpr5- <dig> single mutant, indicating that cpr <dig> is epistatic to progl2:gl <dig> with regard to the degree of endoreplication .

rfu = relative fluorescence units. s.d. = standard deviation. n = number of nuclei examined. rfu values have been normalized to  <dig>  the expected value for trichome nuclei of the wild-type col strain, and thus rfu values should roughly correspond to dna contents. a kruskal-wallis one way anova indicated that differences in the medians were greater than expected by chance ; an all pairwise multiple comparison  indicated that all pairwise comparisons were significantly different  except cpr5- <dig> vs. cpr5- <dig> progl2:gl <dig> 

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
cpr <dig> has been variously proposed to play specific roles in pathogen response signaling  <cit> , senescence  <cit> , and cell proliferation and cell death  <cit> . the work presented here identifies a previously unrecognized cell wall defect in cpr <dig> mutants, resulting in a deficit of paracrystalline cellulose. at the same time, the epistasis of the cpr <dig> phenotype in genetic interactions with try and progl2:gl <dig> indicates that cpr <dig> function is necessary for the increased cell expansion and endoreplication conditioned by loss of try function or by over-expression of gl <dig>  these two genes encode transcription factors that play opposing roles in trichome development. unexpectedly, cpr <dig> mutations also appear to enhance the lateral inhibition signaling defect of try mutants that normally prevents trichomes from forming adjacent to one another .

it is difficult to reconcile our results with the specific roles that have been proposed by others as the most fundamental function of the cpr <dig> gene product, such as pathogen response signaling or endoreplication and programmed cell death. no other constitutive pathogen response mutants have been reported to affect trichomes, and we have observed no trichome defects on examining constitutive expressor of pathogenesis-related genes <dig>  nonexpressor of pr genes <dig> , accelerated cell death <dig> , and accelerated cell death <dig> , and these mutants appeared to have normal birefringent trichome cell walls . similarly, gl <dig> loss-of-function mutants, which have reduced endoreplication, produce normally birefringent trichome walls  <cit> , and trichome walls of plants expressing progl2:ick1/krp <dig>  a construct that induces programmed cell death in trichomes  <cit> , also appear to be normal . it thus seems likely that the cpr <dig> gene product is involved in some general process that is indirectly necessary for trichome cell expansion, pathogen response signaling, and suppressing premature senescence and programmed cell death, rather than being a specialized component of any one of these processes.

an attractive locus of action for the cpr <dig> gene product suggested by our data is the cell wall itself. the cell wall is directly involved in several processes related to the cpr <dig> mutant phenotype, including both cell expansion and pathogen responses  <cit> . recently, a reduction of the rhamnogalacturonan ii component of tobacco cell walls by virus-induced gene silencing  of a udp-d-apiose/udp-d-xylose synthase gene was shown to result in dwarfing of plants, induction of several pathogen-response genes, production of reactive oxygen species, and cell death  <cit> . a cev <dig> mutant of arabidopsis, which has a mutation in the ces3a cellulose synthase gene, was also shown to result in constitutive expression of pathogen response genes and to have enhanced pathogen resistance  <cit> . this mutant was originally identified as an activator of jasmonic acid signaling pathways, and overproduces jasmonic acid and ethylene. furthermore, a mutation in another cellulose synthase gene, rsw <dig>  also results in activation of jasmonic acid signaling, and cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors can mimic the cev <dig> mutant phenotype in wild-type plants, including the activation of pathogen response genes  <cit> . jasmonic acid-dependant pathogen response pathways are known to be activated in cpr <dig> mutants  <cit> . and, not surprisingly, mutations in cellulose synthase genes can affect cell morphology and expansion  <cit> . indeed, the cell expansion defects seen in cpr <dig> mutants are comparable in severity to those seen in cellulose synthase mutants  <cit> 

taken together, these results demonstrate that defects in the cell wall itself can lead to many of the specific aspects of the cpr <dig> mutant phenotype, including the constitutive pathogen response signaling for which it is named. one aspect of the phenotype that is less obviously coupled to the cell wall is the reduced endoreplication seen in cpr <dig>  <cit> . however, the degree of endoreplication is often strongly correlated with cell size  <cit> , and it is possible that limitations on cell expansion have a feedback effect on endoreplication.

an alternative model to explain the extreme pleiotropy of the cpr <dig> mutant phenotype that is the cpr <dig> protein may be required directly for the function of multiple transcription factors involved in a wide range of distinct processes. our observation that cpr <dig> is epistatic to the phenotypes conditioned by try loss-of-function or gl <dig> overexpression indicates that cpr <dig> function is required for the cell expansion and increased endoreplication conditioned by these two transcription factors. the cpr <dig> gene product is predicted to be a type iiia membrane protein with five transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic n-terminus. this n-terminal domain contains a bipartite nuclear localization sequence , and it has been proposed that the protein may be involved in a signaling cascade in which the cytoplasmic domain is proteolytically cleaved and transported into the nucleus  <cit> , a signaling process for which there is substantial precedent  <cit> . an alternative is suggested by recent work demonstrating that some membrane proteins in yeast that localize to the inner nuclear membrane are targeted to this membrane via an nls and use an karyopherin-dependant pathway to enter the nucleus  <cit> . in this case, the full-length cpr <dig> protein might be directly required in the nucleus for function of multiple transcription factors.

either of these models, a primary role for cpr <dig> in cell wall biogenesis or a primary role for cpr <dig> in regulation of nuclear transcription, can provide an explanation for the reduced lateral inhibition  seen in the cpr <dig> try double mutants . altered cell wall structure could reduce transmission of the inhibitory signal by reducing intercellular transport of the functionally redundant members of the try protein family, cpc, etc <dig>  and etc <dig>  perhaps by altering plasmodesmata. alternatively, if cpr <dig> is needed for function of the gl3-ttg-gl <dig> transcriptional activation complex in the nucleus, reduced activity of this complex might result in inefficient upregulation of these try homologs in developing trichomes, reducing the degree of inhibition of trichome development in neighboring cells.

it is obvious that testing these models will require biochemical analysis of localization and function of the cpr <dig> protein. perhaps because it is a membrane protein, little progress has been reported on this front, and our own attempts in this regard have not been fruitful. for example, fluorescent protein fusions to the cpr <dig> coding sequence were generated that fully complemented the cpr <dig> mutant phenotype, but no fluorescence was detected in any of the transgenic lines . nevertheless, the work presented here suggests that the cell wall may be a unifying locus for cpr <dig> function, and will provide guidance for further studies. the important role of cpr <dig> in multiple essential aspects of plant growth and development merits further work to unravel the mechanism of cpr <dig> function.
