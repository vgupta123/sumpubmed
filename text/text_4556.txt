BACKGROUND
the plant cell wall represents one of the main obstacles to the colonization of the plant tissue by microbial pathogens. to surmount this barrier, most fungal pathogens produce cell wall degrading enzymes , among which endo-polygalacturonases  are secreted at very early stages of the infection process . pgs cleave the α- linkages between d-galacturonic acid residues in homogalacturonan, causing cell separation and maceration of host tissue. to counteract the activity of pgs, plants possess cell wall glycoproteins, called polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins , the importance of which in defence has been demonstrated in different plant species .

like the products of many resistance genes, pgips belong to the subclass of proteins containing leucine-rich repeats  of the extracytoplasmic type  . the lrr domain of pgip is typically formed by  <dig> imperfect lrrs of  <dig> residues each and is responsible for the molecular interaction with pgs. the lrrs are organized to form two β-sheets, one of which  occupies the concave inner side of the molecule and contains residues crucial for pg recognition .

to counteract the many pgs produced by fungal pathogens, plants have evolved a variety of pgips with different specificities. variability is present also within each plant species, since pgips are encoded by gene families, comprising  <dig> members in arabidopsis thaliana  up to  <dig> in brassica napus . a clear example of intra-specific variation in the inhibition properties against fungal and insect pgs has been reported for members of the bean  pgip family . variation among different family members extends also to the regulation of their expression .

the soybean  pgip family is composed by at least four genes forming two clusters, one containing gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  separated by about  <dig> kbp, and the other containing gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  separated by a maximum distance of  <dig> kbp . these findings are particularly interesting because soybean is a well-established paleopolyploid plant species. consequently, the characterization of the full complement of the soybean pgip family could provide important information about the forces driving the evolution of this gene family.

in this study, we have characterized the complete set of pgip genes in the soybean genotype williams  <dig> and demonstrated the existence of two pgip loci. the study was extended to other legume species by characterizing a region of about  <dig> kb, comprising the single pgip locus of bean, and the pgip regions in the recently released genomes of medicago truncatula gaertn.  and cicer arietinum l. . comparative analysis between the pgip regions of these species suggests that the legume pgip family follows the birth-and-death model of evolution.

RESULTS
characterization of soybean bac clones and isolation of two novel gmpgip genes
seven bac clones, previously isolated from a soybean bac library using a pgip probe, were analysed with primers specific for gmpgip <dig>  gmpgip <dig>  gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> . none of the bac clones contained all four pgip sequences together. three of them  contained both gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> and two  contained both gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  the remaining two bac clones  did not produce a clear amplicon with none of the gmpgip primer combinations; therefore, they were not analyzed further. the size of the insert contained in each bac clone, determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  following noti digestion, varied between about  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb . fingerprinting of the bac clones following hindiii digestion showed overlapping profiles for those containing gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> , and those containing gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  . bac end sequencing and shotgun subcloning and sequencing identified two novel gmpgip genes, one in the clone 85 m <dig> , the other in the clone 26i <dig> . gmpgip <dig> was at the terminal end of 85 m <dig> and was partial; its complete sequence was obtained by pcr performed on genomic dna. the coding regions of gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> contain uninterrupted open reading frames  of  <dig> and 1011 bp, respectively, including the stop codon. the predicted amino acid sequence of these two orfs showed the typical pgip structure, comprising a  <dig> amino acid signal peptide for secretion in the apoplast,  <dig> leucine rich repeats  of about  <dig> amino acids each and eight cysteine residues, four each at n- and c-terminal part of the protein .

since fingerprint analysis indicated the lack of overlapping portions between the two sets of bac clones, we hypothesized the existence of two pgip loci, one including gmpgip <dig>  gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  as identified in the bac clone 85 m <dig> and the other one including gmpgip <dig>  gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  as identified in the bac clone 26i <dig>  the recent availability of the soybean genome sequence  allowed us to confirm the existence of two pgip loci and to define the spatial distribution of the gmpgip genes .

transcript accumulation and in vitro inhibition assays of gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip7
we have previously reported variation in the expression pattern of gmpgip genes  following infection of soybean hypocotyls with the necrotrophic fungal pathogen sclerotinia sclerotiorum . in this work, we extended the study to gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  qrt-pcr analysis showed that gmpgip <dig> and gmpip <dig> are expressed in soybean hypocotyls and are induced following the infection with s. sclerotiorum. the basal transcript levels of both gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> are much lower than that of gmpgip <dig>  used as control because it is the most highly expressed gmpgip gene in soybean hypocotyls ; moreover, basal expression of gmpgip <dig> was higher than that of gmpgip <dig> . expression of gmpgip <dig> decreases during the first 24 hour post infection  with s. sclerotiorum, to greatly increase by more than  <dig> fold at  <dig> hpi, the last time point analyzed, when the tissue is almost completely macerated . upon infection, expression of gmpgip <dig> shows a moderate increase during the first  <dig> hpi to reach high levels at  <dig> hpi . gmpgip <dig> showed different kinetics of transcript accumulation, with a maximum of five fold increase at  <dig> hpi and no further increase at 48 h .

bquantification of gene expression was performed using the comparative ct method . relative expression of each gene is reported as the fold increase of the transcript level in infected sample relative to each corresponding non-infected control sample and normalized with gmelf1a.

database searches confirmed the presence of expressed sequence tags  corresponding to gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> and showed variation of their expression during development, with gmpgip <dig> ests present in hypocotyls and pods and gmpgip <dig> ests present in roots and stem . ests for the remaining gmpgip genes were also identified, with gmpgip <dig> being the most represented in soybean tissues . in particular, about twice more transcripts have been found in the hypocotyl for this gene compared to gmpgip <dig>  confirming the higher level of expression of gmpgip <dig> shown by the qrt-pcr results .

in order to verify the inhibition activities of gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig> against fungal pgs, we have expressed these genes in nicotiana benthamiana using a vector based on potato virus x . western blot analyses on total protein extracts using an antibody raised against the bean pgip showed the accumulation of gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  which was used as positive control . on the contrary, no immunodecoration signal was detected in extracts prepared from control plants   or from plants infected with the pvx-gmpgip <dig> construct . despite considerable effort, all pvx-based attempts to express gmpgip <dig> failed.

total protein extracts of n. benthamiana leaves infected with the pvx-gmpgip <dig> were then used to test the inhibitory activity of gmpgip <dig> against the fungal pgs of s. sclerotiorum, fusarium graminearum, colletotrichum acutatum and aspergillus niger . no inhibition was observed; on the contrary, all the pgs examined were inhibited by gmpgip <dig>  used as control .

the soybean pgip genes are organized in two distinct loci
sequence comparison of the gmpgip genes contained within the bac clones and the assembled soybean genome sequence allowed us to confirm the presence of two pgip loci and to determine the arrangement of the gmpgip genes within each of them. each cluster of pgip genes spans a region of similar length  on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> . all genes are transcribed in the same direction . in addition to these transcribed pgip genes, two and one remnant sequences were found on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. one of the remnants in the locus on chromosome  <dig>  is heavily fragmented, whereas the other two, on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  encode  <dig> residues of the c-terminal region and  <dig> residues of the n- terminal and middle regions, respectively .

nucleotide sequences of regions the two soybean pgip loci were compared by a bl2seq analysis, showing that the regions flanking the pgip loci are well conserved in nucleotide sequence and collinear in gene order and orientation . the main exception to this collinearity is represented by two major gaps in the alignment, due to ltr retrotransposon insertions in the locus on chromosome  <dig> . notably, the region containing the gmpgip copies shows the most exceptions to the sequence collinearity, as no clear diagonal is visible in this region and alignments are limited to the coding regions of different pgip members .

in the comparison between loci, only gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  on the one side, and gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  on the other side, share similarity in the 3′ regions, limited to the proximal 200 bp sequences. the 5′ regions of the different gmpgip genes are also strongly divergent and sequence divergence in these regions is reflected also in the composition of cis-elements. sequence analysis. limited to known cis-acting elements regulating genes involved in the defence response, showed that all six gmpgip genes contain sequences sharing identity with these elements; differing, however, in types and numbers. for example gmpgip <dig> contains the highest number of w-box elements, whereas it lacks sequences matching bihd1os <dig> elements .

structural analysis of the bean pgip locus
for the characterization of the bean pgip locus, the bean bac clones 129 f <dig> and 10g <dig> spanning the bean pgip locus were isolated from a genomic library prepared from bat <dig> genotype. the 129 f <dig> and 10g <dig> clones contain an insert of about 37150 bp and 107473 bp, respectively, with an overlapping segment of 5201 bp . these clones were completely sequenced allowing the characterization of a total of 139420 bp, with the pgip region spanning about  <dig> kb. this region represents the only pgip locus present in the bean genome and contains four intronless pvpgip genes  transcribed in the same direction .

the assembled bac sequence of p. vulgaris bat <dig> was mapped in two different genomic regions of the recently available genome sequence of p. vulgaris accession g <dig>  a major portion of the assembled bat <dig> sequence  was mapped on chromosome  <dig>  and shown to contain several annotated genes , whereas the remaining  <dig> kb were mapped on chromosome  <dig>  and did not contain annotated genes. three hypotheses can be made to explain this discrepancy: 1) the bac 10g <dig> that contains the two regions is chimeric, i.e. two independent portions of bat <dig> genome were cloned in the same bac; 2) an assembly error, involving the analyzed regions, is present in the whole genome sequence, and 3) a translocation took place that differentiated the p. vulgaris bat <dig> and g <dig> accessions. since the shorter region accounts only for about 10% of the entire bac assembled sequence and shows a potentially different origin from the main bac sequence assembly, we excluded it from subsequent analyses.

in order to analyze the structure of the region containing the bean pgip genes, a blast2seq analysis , limited to the first  <dig> kb of the assembled sequence that contain the four bean pgip genes, was performed. in addition to the diagonal alignment, several short alignments are present . these include two retrotransposable elements , which showed off-diagonal alignment of their long tandem repeats , as tipically shown by ltr retrotransposon ends . the four pgip genes align to each other, and alignment extending beyond the coding regions was observed only between pvbpgip <dig> and pvbpgip <dig> and between pvbpgip <dig> and pvbpgip <dig> . conversely, the alignment between pgip pairs pvbpgip1/pvbpgip <dig>  pvbpgip2/pvbpgip <dig>  pvbpgip1/pvbpgip <dig>  and pvbpgip2/pvbpgip <dig> is limited to the coding regions.

comparison of pgip loci in four fabaceae species
the assembled bean sequence  containing the cluster of pgip genes was compared with the soybean genome and with the recent genome sequence releases of m. truncatula  and c. arietinum . like in bean, the genomes of m. truncatula and c. arietinum contain only one pgip locus. the pgip locus of m. truncatula spans a region of about  <dig> kb containing a cluster of two genes with uninterrupted open reading frames , one possible pseudogene, annotated with an intron of 40 bp to restore the correct open reading frame , and one remnant corresponding to a sequence encoding a c-terminal  <dig> residue pgip fragment. the products encoded by mtpgip <dig> mtpgip <dig> and mtpgip <dig> are shown in additional file  <dig>  they all contain a signal peptide for secretion to the apoplast, the typical  <dig> lrrs and eight cysteine residues, four each in n- and c-terminal portion of the protein; mtpgip <dig> contains an additional cysteine in the c-terminal region . similarly, the pgip locus of c. arietinum spans a region of about 30 k and contains two pgip genes , one of which  is interrupted by a fragment of about  <dig> kb in the middle of the coding region. the putative protein encoded by capgip <dig>  also contains the typical pgip features described above . taken together, these sequence analyses highlight that the typical pgip structure is strongly conserved among and within all these pgip families. this conservation is accompanied, as expected, by the typical variation within lrrs composing each protein, and lrrs of different proteins.

sequence comparison between the flanking regions of the pgip clusters in all four species, showed few genes and a very well conserved order, with few exceptions. of the ten bean genes flanking the pgip cluster, only pv_ <dig> and pv_ <dig> are not conserved in all four legume species . moreover, pv_ <dig> and pv_ <dig> exist as duplicated genes only in the bean genome, and pv  <dig> was lost in soybean chromosome  <dig> .

pgip protein sequences from these four fabaceae species  were aligned by muscle and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by a maximum likelihood approach . as shown in figure  <dig>  the unrooted tree revealed that: i) m. truncatula and c. arietinum pgip copies are in species-specific clusters, suggesting that copy amplification took place after the divergence of species; ii) the m. truncatula and c. arietinum pgip clusters are close to each other and form a very well supported cluster; iii) the g. max and p. vulgaris pgip members are in a different cluster, consistent with the general taxonomic relationships of these members of the fabaceae. furthermore, g. max and p. vulgaris genes are distributed in three main clusters: a) a cluster including pvbpgip <dig>  pvbpgip <dig> and gmpgip3; b) a cluster including pvbpgip <dig> and pvbpgip <dig> and c) a cluster containing the remaining g. max genes.

discussion
in this work, we have demonstrated that the full complement of the soybean pgip family is composed of six transcribed genes located in two different loci in the sub-terminal and terminal regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. each pgip locus contains both complete and disrupted coding regions indicating that a pseudogenization  process is active in the family. as assumed for nbs-lrr r-genes , the clusters of recently duplicated pgip copies should provide a reservoir of genetic variation from which novel pgip genes can evolve. the resemblance to nbs-lrr r-genes is further supported by previous findings showing that variation between pgip genes of different species or copies within a gene family is mainly due to single substitutions within the lrr domain and in particular in the xxlxlxx solvent-exposed region . like in r-genes, models of codon evolution suggest the presence, in the solvent-exposed region of pgip, of sites under positive selection , and functional analysis demonstrated that single substitutions or a short deletion within this region can cause changes in the inhibition properties of pgip against fungal pgs .

an interesting feature of the soybean pgip loci, which are included in a larger duplicated region, is the high sequence conservation of the regions surrounding the pgip clusters that contrasts with the variability in the intergenic regions between pgip genes. differences in the regions external to the pgip gene clusters are limited to small indels and to the presence of two transposable elements only in the region of chromosome  <dig>  this conserved organization is typical of the paleopolyploid soybean genome, which underwent two rounds of whole genome duplication  . recent analysis of the complete soybean genome sequence has revealed that indeed this is composed to a large extent by blocks of duplicated genes ; however. before the availability of the complete assembled soybean genome, data had indicated that the soybean genome was a mosaic of alternating homeologous regions retaining high sequence conservation and regions showing very low conservation .

in the homeologous regions containing the pgip clusters, the striking conservation is interrupted only by the remarkable sequence variability in the intergenic regions between the pgip genes. this low sequence conservation includes the proximal 5′ flanking regions, suggesting a differential regulation of the different pgip genes. indeed, the six pgip genes show variation in cis-acting elements known to regulate defense response genes, and their expression patterns following pathogen infection show clear differences. the two novel pgip genes, gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  are poorly expressed in soybean hypocotyls but are strongly induced at late stages of infection with the fungal pathogen s. sclerotiorum. this expression pattern is similar to that of gmpgip <dig> and differs from that of gmpgip <dig>  gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  which all show a more prompt induction following s. sclerotiorum infection . diversification of gene regulation following fungal pathogen infections or stress stimuli has been reported for other pgip gene families, including those of arabidopsis , bean  and b. napus , and suggests adaptation against stresses. however, this possibility in soybean is still poorly supported at the protein level, since, at present, inhibition activity against fungal pgs has been shown in vitro only for the product encoded by gmpgip <dig>  which is also the most expressed soybean family member . in fact, although gmpgip <dig>  gmpgip <dig> and gmpgip <dig>  and now also gmpgip <dig> were expressed in n. benthamiana using pvx as a vector, they did not show any inhibitory activity. the lack of in vitro inhibition activity of gmpgips does not exclude the possibility that they can inhibit pgs from different sources not yet examined, or that only the in planta environment provides a suitable context to support the interaction with pgs. this last possibility has been suggested by joubert et al.  who found a reduction of symptoms caused by the activity of botrytis cinerea bcpg <dig> on plant tissue when co-infiltrated with vitis vinifera vvpgip <dig>  although no interaction between vvpgip <dig> and bcpg <dig> was detected in vitro. moreover, as suggested previously , the lack of inhibition activity by gmpgip <dig>  gmpgip <dig> gmpgip <dig> and now gmpgip <dig> towards fungal pgs may reflect a different physiological role in planta. this possibility is supported by several observations in different plant species. for example, osfor <dig>  a rice protein possessing pg inhibiting capabilities, affects the formation and/or maintenance of floral organ primordia in rice ; levels of pgip <dig> determine the timing of radicle protrusion in arabidopsis , and vvpgip <dig> can affect gene expression and cell wall structure in transgenic tobacco plants .

the genomic regions encompassing the pgip genes of soybean were also compared to the corresponding region of bean, which shares a very close phylogenetic relationship with soybean. the pgip gene family of the bean genotype bat <dig>  which comprises four clustered paralogs, has been previously characterized . we have now extended the analysis to the bean bat <dig> sequences flanking the pgip cluster and found a very strong conservation in the distribution of the genes compared to duplicated soybean regions encompassing the pgip loci. of the ten bean genes flanking the pgip cluster, seven were conserved in both soybean chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  pv_ <dig> was lost only on soybean chromosome  <dig>  and the duplicated bean genes pv_ <dig> and pv_ <dig> exist as a single copy in both soybean chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> 

conservation of the genomic pgip region is also evident in the more distantly related legume species m. truncatula and c. arietinum, whose assembled genomes have been recently released . both species possess a single pgip locus, with a cluster organization of the paralogs, and regions flanking the pgip array that maintain the strongly conserved distribution of the genes observed in the soybean and bean. of the ten bean genes that surround the pgip cluster, seven are conserved in all four legume species. the finding that most of the pgip genes are organized in species-specific phylogenetic clusters indicates that the pgip copies within each cluster were independently formed after speciation. an exception to this observation is represented by gmpgip <dig>  pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig>  in fact, the soybean and bean pgips form separated clusters in maximum likelihood-based gene trees and, within the bean cluster, the four pvpgips form two well separated groups. however, as previously highlighted , the soybean gmpgip <dig> groups with pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip <dig>  suggesting that the duplication originating the ancestors of pvpgip1/pvpgip <dig> and pvpgip3/pvpgip <dig> took place before the separation of glycine and phaseolus lineages. in this context, it is noteworthy that the high sequence conservation of pvpgip <dig> extends across a range of p. vulgaris germplasm and other phaseolus species, suggesting an adaptive significance .

CONCLUSIONS
the paleopolyploid soybean genome contains two pgip loci comprised in large and highly conserved duplicated regions, likely originating from wgd. the region encompassing the pgip locus is also conserved in bean, m. truncatula and c. arietinum. the genomic features of these legume pgip families, which include inferred recent duplications and pseudogenization of pgip copies, suggest that the forces driving the evolution of pgip genes follow the birth-and-death model, similarly to that proposed for the evolution of nbs-lrr-type r genes .
