BACKGROUND
cytotoxic t lymphocytes  are key components of the cell-mediated immune responses and play an essential role in protection from and containment of a variety of pathogens  <cit> . since ctls have been shown to play a major role in the control of human immunodeficiency virus  and other lentiviruses  <cit> , measurement of their activity has become an important parameter for testing the efficacy of candidate vaccines and other immunologic interventions directed against these important agents of disease  <cit> .

ctl assays require that the test antigen is presented by target cells having the same or compatible class i major hystocompatibility complex antigens as the effector cells. this permits to the antigen-specific ctls to interact with the target cells and determine their lysis, which is then quantitated as a measure of ctl activity. the most used format is the 51chromium -release assay in which this radioisotope, absorbed by the target cells prior to mixing with the effector cells, is released in the supernatant medium and measured at the end of the incubation period  <cit> . this assay is sensitive but has the disadvantage of requiring the manipulation and disposal of hazardous radioactive reagents. thus, over the years, 51cr has been tentatively replaced by various cell dyes with somewhat inconsistent results. however, all these assays have the limitation of providing a bulk estimate of the reporter released, which may be influenced by several, poorly controllable variables, such as inefficient labeling of target cells or spontaneous release of the label  <cit> . more recently, new flow cytometry-based  assays, using target cells labeled with fluorescent dyes or substrates for caspases or other apoptotic enzymes, have been proposed  <cit> . these assays appear to be as or more sensitive than the standard 51cr methods and, in addition, may permit to precisely count the target cells that have actually been lysed and to identify the phenotype of the effector cells involved  <cit> .

here, we describe a novel method for producing target cells that has provided satisfactory results in an f-ctl assay we have set up to assess envelope -specific ctl activity in domestic specific pathogen-free  cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus , the feline equivalent of hiv. since no inbred cats are available, testing ctl activity in this species is dependent on the use of autologous target cells, a factor that has hitherto limited routine measurements of ctl activity  <cit> . the method relies on a bicistronic vector derived from fiv but having very little left of the original virus which is used to transduce immortalized feline skin fibroblasts. since the vector can be pseudotyped with the different envs and may have broad tropism  <cit> , the method is potentially exploitable in other animal species as well.

RESULTS
production and characterization of the target cells
production of the target cells expressing the env of fiv-petaluma  and reporter green fluorescent protein  is schematically depicted by figure  <dig>  primary fibroblasts were obtained by culturing skin biopsies of the study cats and, when confluent, transferred to larger flasks. one flask was then used to control for cell competence for transfection by using a plasmid encoding gfp . as expected for primary cells and in agreement with köksoy et al.  <cit> , the fibroblasts proved moderately transfectable, since by day  <dig> post transfection gfp expressing cells ranged between 15% and 30% . the remaining flasks were transfected with a plasmid encoding a replication defective simian virus  <dig>  genome  and subcultured every 3– <dig> days for further  <dig> weeks. ten to  <dig> days later, the pactsv <dig> transfected cells showed unequivocal signs of immortalization that were maintained for at least  <dig> passages regardless of whether the cells were kept in culture continuously or repeatedly freeze-stored and cultured again. this contrasted strongly with sister cultures that were left untreated or transfected with pcdna3-gfp, which reached senescence after 6– <dig> passages and barely resisted freezing . of note, fibroblasts generated from fiv-infected animals – regardless of whether immortalized or not – showed no evidence of fiv replication, as determined by weekly testing the supernatants for p <dig> capsid antigen, suggesting that they had been spared from infection or had stopped supporting detectable fiv replication as a result of culture .

transduction of pactsv <dig> immortalized fibroblasts was carried out with viral particles produced in 293t cells and encapsidating the monocystronic vector carrying gfp alone  or the bicistronic version delivering env and gfp  . for a preliminary assessment of the efficiency of transduction, the immortalized fibroblasts of an uninfected cat were exposed to serial 2-fold dilutions of a vgfp preparation and,  <dig> days later, analyzed for gfp expression by flow cytometry. the proportion of cells transduced proved clearly dose-dependent ranging from 10% with  <dig>  transduction units /cell to over 90% with  <dig> tu/cell. importantly, transduced cells fluoresced at high levels  even after several weeks in culture and when repeatedly stored frozen and recultured , indicative of a stable transduction. different batches of the vectors and fresh or thawed cells yielded similar results. interestingly, for reasons that were not specifically addressed, immortalized fibroblasts proved consistently more prone to transduction  than the non-immortalized cells from which they derived .

unless differently stated, in the subsequent studies the immortalized fibroblasts expressing env and gfp  used as targets were obtained by transducing with  <dig> tu venv-gfp per cell. figure 2b shows the results obtained with this tu dose in one experiment in which we compared immortalized fibroblasts obtained from  <dig> cats, one uninfected and  <dig> chronically fiv infected, for susceptibility to transduction. although at day  <dig> post-transduction the percentage of control cells expressing gfp alone  varied somewhat, transduction was successful with the cells of all cats. in addition, both the proportion of transduced cells and the extent they expressed env had a clear tendency to increase with time, at least for the  <dig> weeks investigated . importantly, the env expressed by env+gfp+ fibroblasts showed a precursor to surface glycoprotein ratio similar to that of cells chronically infected with fiv, indicating that it was processed correctly .

the env+gfp+ fibroblasts as a stimulus for expanding env-specific ctl activity ex vivo
in this experiment we investigated if and how effectively the env+gfp+ fibroblasts could be used as a stimulus to expand env-specific ctl activity ex vivo by comparing them with immortalized fibroblasts loaded with a pool of peptides covering the whole fiv env. this was done by using the peripheral blood mononuclear cells  of br, bs and cf,  <dig> chronically fiv infected cats known to possess substantial env-specific ctl activity as a result of boosting with a dna immunogen . these pbmcs were co-cultured for  <dig> days with autologous immortalized fibroblasts that had been transduced with venv-gfp or had been pulsed for  <dig> hour with the pooled peptides or, as controls, with autologous gfp+ fibroblasts or fibroblasts that had not been further manipulated. the pmbcs thus incubated were then tested for ctl activity against env+gfp+ fibroblasts. lysis by pbmcs restimulated with autologous gfp+ fibroblasts or immortalized fibroblasts was at background levels . the env+gfp+ fibroblasts caused an expansion of ctl activity readily measurable  and substantially higher than the peptide-loaded counterparts . as expected, either stimulus had no effect on the pbmcs of an uninfected cat used as control.

the env+gfp+ fibroblasts as targets for measuring env-specific ctl activity in acutely fiv infected cats
collectively, the above data had demonstrated that the env+gfp+ fibroblasts expressed the target and reporter genes in stable and correct fashion. to test whether they were also suitable targets for ctl assays, we employed them in the f-ctl assay using, as effector cells, pbmcs collected from cats during acute fiv infection. fibroblasts were harvested from spf cats gn, go, gp and gq, processed as above, and frozen. the animals were then inoculated with a dose of fiv-pet which produced the expected levels of viremia as determined starting  <dig> weeks post-infection. ctl activity was examined  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks after infection. the test was carried out both with fresh pbmcs and with pbmcs that, prior to the f-ctl assay, were restimulated ex vivo with autologous env+gfp+ fibroblasts as described above. target cells were autologous env+gfp+ fibroblasts and, as controls, autologous gfp+ fibroblasts and heterologous env+gfp+ fibroblasts; however, significant cell lysis was observed only with the former cells. as depicted by figure  <dig>  which shows the percent specific lysis values observed with the unstimulated pbmcs at effector:target  ratios of 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  in one cat ctl activity could already be detected  <dig> weeks post-infection. in the other animals, the test was first found positive at  <dig> weeks post-infection, usually at the e:t ratio 50: <dig> only. at later times of infection, this picture did not change significantly, except for the fact that e:t ratio 10: <dig> yielded a measurable level of lysis more frequently than at earlier times. percent lysis obtained with ex vivo restimulated pbmcs were only marginally higher than obtained with fresh pbmcs , suggesting that in acutely infected cats env-specific ctl activity cannot be significantly expanded ex vivo. of note, cat gq who exhibited the most prompt and robust ctl response developed levels of plasma viremia, proviral dna in the pbmc, and a reduction of circulating cd4+ t-lymphocyte counts similar to the other animals .

the env+gfp+ fibroblasts as targets for measuring env-specific ctl activity in chronically fiv infected cats
in these experiments, env+gfp+ fibroblasts and f-ctl assay were used to measure anti-env ctl in the pbmcs of three spf cats infected with fiv-pet  <dig> years earlier. as determined by periodical monitoring, these animals were in a steady state phase of infection since they had stable or slightly fluctuating moderate levels of viremia, high fiv antibodies titers, and moderately reduced circulating cd4+ t-lymphocytes counts . a fourth cat , who had been inoculated exactly as the others but had remained consistently fiv negative, was used as noninfected control. effector pbmcs were either used fresh or restimulated ex vivo by co-cultivation with autologous env+gfp+ fibroblasts; however, in no case they exhibited measurable ctl activity . an attempt was therefore done to boost anti-env immune responses of the cats by dna immunization. starting  <dig> weeks after the above ctl assay, the  <dig> animals were given  <dig> doses of a plasmid encoding the env of fiv-pet and feline granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor ,  <dig> weeks apart, and after  <dig> further weeks again tested for ctl activity. as shown by figure  <dig>  the uninfected control cat showed no evidence that this immunization had elicited significant ctl activity. in contrast, all  <dig> fiv chronically infected animals exhibited robust ctl activity, ranging between 16% and 35% at e:t ratio 10: <dig>  when the test was repeated  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after completion of dna immunization, ctl activity was found to have substantially declined; however, it was generally in the measurable range  and, at least at week  <dig>  it could be substantially expanded ex vivo . incidentally, this immunization was also followed by a reduction of fiv rna and proviral dna loads and by an increment of circulating cd <dig> t+ lymphocytes, thus showing that it had exerted a beneficial effect on infection course .

discussion
measurement of ctl activity is considered of paramount importance for predicting protection from infection by lentiviruses and other pathogens  <cit>  but may be difficult due to a number of technical complications. in particular, production and use of suitable target cells generally needs expertise and facilities for using vaccinia vectors and radioactive compounds and, in non syngeneic hosts, it may be especially tricky due to the need for a constant source of mhc class  <dig> matched antigen-positive targets. in developing the ctl assay described here we took advantage of the method described by kölsoy et al.  <cit>  who, as target cells, used immortalized autologous feline primary fibroblasts infected with a recombinant vaccinia vector delivering the test antigen. similarly infected primary feline fibroblasts have also been used as target cells but could be propagated in vitro for maximum 1– <dig> months before undergoing senescence and eventually dying off  <cit> . in their study, kölsoy et al. demonstrated that it is possible to obtain an unlimited source of target cells retaining the same mhc class i phenotype as the cells of origin by immortalizing fibroblasts with replication competent sv <dig>  to avoid full transformation and minimize the risk of abnormal self-antigen expression, we have instead used a molecular clone of sv <dig>  rendered unable to replicate through an internal deletion in the large t-antigen, which immortalized primary feline fibroblasts as efficiently as wild-type sv <dig> . this clone had previously been shown to transform established cell lines, such as nih-3t <dig> cells, but to be unable to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts  <cit> .

because we wished to test immortalized fibroblasts as a tool for measuring env-specific ctl activity in fiv infected and vaccinated cats, we attempted to infect these cells with fiv, with no success. fibroblasts from fiv infected cats also proved consistently virus-negative, thus excluding the possibility of using direct fiv infection as a means of obtaining the desired target cells. we therefore exploited a bicistronic vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein g  coated vector derived in our laboratory from fiv but carrying very little of the original virus, vector that had been previously shown to effectively introduce transgenes into primary cells of both feline and nonfeline origin  <cit> . the vector used carried the env of fiv-pet and gfp as target and reporter transgene, respectively. immortalized fibroblasts transduced at high multiplicity with this vector were approximately 90% positive for both transgenes and proved valuable both as target cells for use in a f-ctl assay and as a stimulus for expanding ctls ex vivo.

differently from the methods that rely on vaccinia virus infection or transfection or on peptide loading used in traditional 51cr assays  <cit>  and in the more recently described  assays  <cit> , this method generates target cells stably expressing the antigen of interest and the reporter molecule. this has been achieved by using a bicistronic vector that i) does not require the containment procedures needed for the recombinant vaccinia viruses that are frequently used to introduce transgenes in target cells, ii) overcomes the intrinsic resistance to transfection of primary and non-adherent cells, iii) delivers two large transgenes for up to  <dig> kbs, iv) stably transduces cells, thus permitting to use the same batch of targets in follow-up studies, minimizing inter-assay variation, v) allows transduction of cells irrespective of animal species; vi) is replication incompetent, making it unnecessary ultraviolet irradiation or other treatments of the target cells to prevent infection transmission to effector cells, and last but not least, vii) permits the use of f-ctl assays. while most other ctl assays detect radioisotopes or cell dyes released from the target cell population in bulk and may have a high background noise due to spontaneous release of the markers, f-ctl assays rely on the actual enumeration of target cells made fluorescent by gfp, a protein that is not secreted by the cells and does not fluoresce if degraded or improperly folded in dying cells, and with the use of specific cell-specific markers may also permit phenotyping of the effector cells  <cit> .

a limitation of the present study is that the f-ctl assay was not directly compared to established techniques. however, its validity was assessed by evaluating fiv env-specific ctl activity in both acutely and chronically fiv-infected cats. the method proved valuable in either situation. during the early stages of infection, characterized by acute viral replication and vigorous cell-mediated immune responses  <cit> , the assay detected levels of env-specific ctl activity in the pbmcs of infected cats similar to those previously reported with 51cr ctl assays using sv40-immortalized or primary feline fibroblasts infected by recombinant vaccinia viruses  <cit> , with no need for the effector cells to be restimulated ex vivo, a procedure frequently necessary when using the standard cr <dig> assay  <cit> . in contrast, in the chronically infected cells we detected no measurable env-specific ctl activity even when the effector pbmcs were restimulated ex vivo. this may have reflected the fact that, especially in the periphery  <cit> , anti-fiv env cell-mediated immune responses tend to wane with time of infection  <cit> , or immunosenescence of the cats who were  <dig> year-old when tested  <cit> , or a combination of these factors  <cit> . in any case, administration to the chronically infected cats of a dna vaccine encoding the env of the infecting fiv and feline granuloyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor , a cytokine known to induce dendritic cell proliferation and improve antigen presentation  <cit> , with a protocol that had elicited fairly good cell-mediated immune responses when tested in a prior prophylactic study , brought back substantial levels of ctl activity. ctl activity showed a maximum  <dig> weeks after completion of the vaccination schedule and then gradually decreased as previously observed for other fiv antigens  <cit> , but in 2/ <dig> animals it remained detectable for at least  <dig> weeks without the need for restimulating ex vivo their pbmc. interestingly, this correlated with a beneficial effect of the vaccine on infection course, as demonstrated by a decrease of viral rna in plasma and proviral load in the pbmcs and an increase of circulating cd4+ t-lymphocytes . of note, vaccination on an uninfected control cat elicited a modest ctl response that exceeded the cut-off only at an early post-vaccination time point only, suggesting that the vigorous ctl activity brought forth by vaccination in the chronically infected cats was mostly due to a recall of pre-existing immunity rather than to ex novo induction.

CONCLUSIONS
the f-ctl assay described, using immortalized feline fibroblasts stably transduced with the test antigen and the gfp reporter as target cells, has proven valuable in evaluating env-specific ctl activity in fiv infected and vaccinated cats. given the versatility of the bicistronic vector used for producing target cells, the method has the potential to be used for a wide array of antigens and hosts.
