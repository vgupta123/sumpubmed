BACKGROUND
the thermophilic filamentous fungus myceliophthora thermophila exhibits a large capacity for biomass degradation and represents a potential reservoir of novel enzymes for industrial applications, including abundant thermostable enzymes for biomass degradation . m. thermophila also has the potential to be a cell factory to produce chemicals and biofuels from renewable lignocellulose  <cit> . therefore, metabolic engineering of m. thermophila is attractive. to use m. thermophila in industrial biotechnology, the development of versatile genetic tools is urgently needed.

peg-mediated protoplast transformation was developed to knock out target genes and for hetero-expression of interesting genes in several filamentous fungi, such as aspergillus and trichoderma . it was previously reported this approach can be used to transform the industrial strain c <dig>  previously known as chrysosporium lucknowense, and recently renamed as an isolate of myceliophthora thermophila  <cit> . however, preparation of fungal protoplasts was laborious, and heterokaryotic transformants might have genetic stability concerns  <cit> . the c <dig> strain is a patented strain, therefore the atcc  <dig> strain is predominantly used for public research as the general wild-type strain of m. thermophila. the whole genome sequence of atcc  <dig> has been completed and is open to the public  <cit> . various studies have been performed with m. thermophila atcc  <dig>  such as biochemical characterization of enzymes  and investigating cellulose degradation on a cellular and genomic level  <cit> . however, molecular engineering using a genetic approach has not been reported in m. thermophila atcc  <dig> because of a lack of mature genetic tools. agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation has become a common technique for filamentous fungi . this technique allows transfer of a segment from its ti plasmid into plant or fungi cells, and the t-dna integrates into the nuclear chromosome either randomly or specifically. the direct transformation of conidia makes a. tumefaciens t-dna transfer a powerful and easy to use tool for genetic transformation of filamentous fungi. a variety of fungi have been successfully transformed by this approach . however, the application of this approach in thermophilic filamentous fungi, including m. thermophila, has not been tested so far.

in present study, we developed a high efficiency transformation and targeted gene disruption system mediated by a. tumefaciens for m. thermophila atcc  <dig>  using this technique, up to  <dig> transformants were obtained per transformation plate, and a ku <dig> deletion strain was constructed in the atcc  <dig> background and characterized. all of the tools and strains developed here should facilitate the development of m. thermophila metabolic engineering and accelerate the elucidation of the fascinating cellulose degradation mechanism in this thermophilic fungus.

RESULTS
marker selection and genetic transformation in the atcc  <dig> strain
to perform m. thermophila transformation mediated by a. tumefaciens, the sensitivity of this fungus to hygromycin b  and phosphinothricin  was tested. five concentrations of two antibiotics were used. the mature conidia were harvested in  <dig>  % tween  <dig>  and  <dig> conidia were spread on mm  agar plates supplemented with various concentrations of antibiotic . after incubation at 45 °c for 5 days, hygromycin b showed little inhibition for m. thermophila at more than  <dig> ug/ml, whereas phosphinothricin concentration completely inhibited the growth of this fungus at  <dig> ug/ml. thus, the bar gene conferring fungal resistance to phosphinothricin was employed as the selection marker for m. thermophila transformation.

the ti vector ppk2bargfpd containing the trpc promoter from aspergillus nidulans and the tef promoter from aureobasidium pullulans  developed in a previous study  <cit>  was chosen as the test plasmid for genetic transformation in m. thermophila atcc  <dig>  the vector contains a gfp reporter gene as well as a bar selection marker gene, which confers resistance to phosphinothricin. pcr analysis of the transformants showed the t-dna was integrated in the chromosomes. high levels of green fluorescent protein  signal were clearly detected in the conidia and mycelia of transformants , whereas no autofluorescent signal was observed in the parental strain. this suggested ppk2bargfpd and its elements, the promoters and the gfp gene, were functioning and could be used for gene over-expression and protein localization analysis in m. thermophila atcc  <dig> fig.  <dig> confocal fluorescence imaging of mycelia  and conidia  of m. thermophila ppk2bargfpd transformants



optimization of m. thermophila transformation mediated by a. tumefaciens
in an attempt to develop a simple, high efficiency transformation system mediated by a. tumefaciens in m. thermophila atcc  <dig>  we performed transformation optimization as described previously  <cit> . acetosyringone  serves as an inducer of virulence  genes, whose expression is a prerequisite for a. tumefaciens t-dna transfer. as concentration influences the frequency of a. tumefaciens-mediated transformation for saccharomyces cerevisiae and several filamentous fungi  <cit> . therefore, the impact of as on this approach for m. thermophila was first investigated. as shown in fig. 2a, using the binary plasmid ppk2bargfpd, the maximum transformation efficiency  was obtained with as at a concentration of 200 μm, and the number of transformants was reduced when the concentration was increased or decreased. the observation that the higher concentration of as resulted in a reduction in transformation efficiency is similar to that for fusarium avenaceum. however, it is in contrast to that for beauveria bassiana, where an increase in the concentration from 100 μm to 800 μm resulted in increasing numbers of transformants  <cit> . based on these observation, the different fungus seems has different tolerance to acetosyringone , the low frequency of transformation induced by the increased as might be attributed to the toxic effect of as on m. thermophila, and the deficient level of vir gene expression at low as concentrations might be responsible for poor efficiency of a. tumefaciens t-dna transfer.fig.  <dig> optimization of a. tumefaciens-mediated m. thermophila transformation. a the impact of acetosyringone  on a. tumefaciens-mediated transformation efficiency. co-cultivation was conducted in induction medium containing as on indicated concentrations for 2 days. b the effect of co-culture time on transformation efficiency. co-cultivation was conducted in induction medium containing 200 μm as for various times indicated. error bars indicate the standard deviation of three independent experiments



the transformation efficiency is also dependent on co-culture time of m. thermophila and a. tumefaciens. the largest number of transformants was observed with a co-culture time of 2 days, and alterative co-culture times impaired the transformation efficiency . similar results were obtained in metarhizium anisopliae, aspergillus terreus and beauveria bassiana transformation mediated by a. tumefaciens  <cit> , whereas the co-culture time had no influence on a ganoderma lucidum transformation system  <cit> . in conclusion, with the optimized approach, a high transformation efficiency of  <dig> transformants per  <dig> conidia was obtained. this was higher compared with the amount of transformants obtained in fungi using other approaches, typically less than  <dig> transformants per  <dig> conidia .

mitotic stability analysis of transformants
the mitotic stability of the t-dna in m. thermophila transformants was examined next. twenty randomly selected transformants containing ppk2bargfpd were cultured on media without phosphinothricin for five generations. after five generations,  <dig> transformants  of  <dig> tested strains retained the resistance to phosphinothricin. satisfyingly, pcr analysis showed the presence of bar in the  <dig> transformants, and gfp signal was observed under the fluorescence microscope.

ku <dig> disruption of m. thermophila atcc 42464
the high transformation frequency, together with the precision and simplicity of t-dna, make a. tumefaciens-mediated transformation a suitable genome mutagenesis approach in filamentous fungi, such as trichoderma, aspergillus, beauveria and metarhizium  <cit> . ku <dig> and ku <dig> make up the ku heterodimer, which binds to the ends of double-stranded dna breaks and is required for the non-homologous end joining  pathway of dna repair  <cit> . in some fungi, including the m. thermophila c <dig> strain, trichoderma reesei and neurospora crassa, mutation of ku <dig> results in a dramatically increased homologous integration frequency with short homologous flanks  <cit> . therefore, disruption of ku <dig> of the atcc  <dig> strain was performed to test the efficiency of this approach for knocking out of a specific gene in wild-type m. thermophila.

the binary vector ppk2bargfpd was employed for dna manipulation and the ku <dig> knockout cassette  was constructed as described in the methods section. the gene encoding green fluorescence protein on the binary vector served as the marker to differentiate between ectopic insertion and correct gene replacement. fluorescence should not be detected in the transformants where the target gene  was properly replaced by the bar cassette . conversely, if the fluorescent signal is detected in a transformant, this suggests the bar-gfp segment of the t-dna was ectopically integrated elsewhere in the genome  rather than at the correct gene locus. using this strategy, we performed the ku <dig> disruption experiment. one hundred sixteen primary transformants were obtained. forty-six  transformants were filtered out by an obvious fluorescent signal, indicating they were ectopic insertion mutants. the remaining  <dig> transformants  with no detectable fluorescent signal under the microscope were likely free of ectopic insertions and passed the first round screening. subsequent pcr analysis showed the ku <dig> gene was properly replaced by the bar cassette in  <dig> of these  <dig> transformants. to further confirm this observation, we randomly selected eleven pcr-confirmed transformants to perform southern blotting analysis, and the result showed all  <dig> tested mutants were correct . taken together, these results indicate as many as 58 %  of the transformants could be correct ku <dig> disruption mutants, indicating a very high rate of homologous recombination. previous studies reported that the efficiencies of genetic targeted disruption via transformation mediated by a. tumefaciens varied greatly in fungal species, such as  <dig>  % for blastomyces dermatitidis, 29 % for aspergillus awamori, 74 % for fusarium avenaceum and 85 % for fusarium graminearum  <cit> . compared with transformation by direct electroporation transformation of protoplasts or conidia, the transformation mediated by a. tumefaciens seems more likely to achieve a higher successful gene disruption rate, at least for some of the species. for example, in neurospora crassa the homologous recombination rate was usually low  without nhej disruption using electroporation  <cit> . although future studies with more precise statistical analyses are needed to support the improved homologous recombination rate, if validated, it will be a boost for genetic manipulation in this strain, and will speed up strain engineering for industrial applications.fig.  <dig> vector map of the ppk2-ku <dig> vector constructed based on binary vector ppk2bargfpd. kan, kanamycin resistance gene; ptef, promoter of translation elongation factor gene from aureobasidium pullulans; egfp, enhanced green fluorescence protein; ptrpc, promoter of tryptophan synthetase gene from aspergillus nidulans; bar, phosphinothricin resistance gene; 3′-flank and 5′-flank, 3′ and 5′ flanking fragments of ku <dig>  respectively; rb and lb, right and left border of t-dna, respectively

there was no noticeable difference between ku <dig> disruption mutants and the wild-type strain during our analysis . after five generations of sub-culturing on mm agar medium,  <dig> randomly selected ku <dig> mutants were shown to be mitotically stable. taken together, these results indicate the approach we developed is an efficient system for gene disruption in m. thermophila atcc  <dig> fig.  <dig> phenotypic characterization of ku <dig> mutant. a protein concentration in supernatants from wild-type  and ku <dig> mutant cultures grown on 1 % avicel for  <dig> d at 45 °c. b sds-page gel of wild-type and Δku <dig> strains grown at 45 °c for  <dig> d on 1 % avicel. c conidiation of wild-type and Δku <dig> strains growth at 45 °c for  <dig> d on agar plate without selective agent. d the hyphae of wild-type and Δku <dig> strains growth at 45 °c for 24 h on liquid mm without selective agent



in order to check whether the gene homologous recombination rate was improved in ku <dig> mutant compared to that in wild type strain, we chose the potential marker gene pyrg  as a test to disrupt in both wild-type and ku <dig> deletion strain. as expected, 97 %  of transformants were correct pyrg deletion mutants under ku <dig> background, whereas only 30 %  of transformants were correct in wild type background . this result clearly shown the deletion of ku <dig> gene can improve the gene homologous recombination in this strain, similar as reported before  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pyrg gene deletion in wild type and ∆ku <dig> mutant of m. thermophila atcc  <dig>  the experiment design , pcr analysis of transformants under wild-type background  and ∆ku <dig> mutant  with one primer  located in the neo gene cassette and the other  located in the downstream of 3′ flank in the genomic dna. the genomic dna from the wild-type  and ∆ku <dig> strains was used as the negative control



taken together, these results indicate the approach we developed is an efficient system for gene disruption in m. thermophila atcc  <dig> and will speed up its strain engineering for industrial applications.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully developed a simple and highly efficient transformation approach mediated by a. tumefaciens for the thermophilic filamentous fungus m. thermophila. this study established a targeted gene deletion approach using green fluorescence protein as a selection helper to filter the ectopic insertion. the tools and ku <dig> mutant developed by the present study should facilitate m. thermophila strain development for industrial applications in the future.
