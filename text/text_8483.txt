BACKGROUND
homeobox genes encode transcription factors known as homeoproteins that share a highly conserved  <dig> amino acid dna-binding motif called a homeodomain  <cit> . homeoproteins are known to regulate expression of genes involved in critical developmental and physiological processes in all living organisms. these processes include body plan segmentation, organogenesis, molecular gradient specification, and cell lineage specification and differentiation. homeoproteins have been identified in several tissues and the male reproductive system is no exception .

the male reproductive system is essential for the production of fully functional gametes and for the establishment of the secondary sexual characteristics. it is composed of the testis and several secondary sex organs: the rete testis, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and bulbourethral glands. proper development of the male reproductive system is thus indispensable for normal male sex differentiation and reproductive function. the process of male sex determination/differentiation is triggered by the y chromosome-linked sry  gene . in the mouse, sry is transiently expressed  specifically in pre-sertoli cells. since sry expression is limited to a discrete period of testis differentiation  <cit> , it acts as a molecular switch to turn on a network of molecular and cellular events essentials for testicular development as well as male sex differentiation. three critical hormones produced by the somatic cells of the newly formed testis are essential for male sex differentiation and reproductive function: müllerian inhibiting substance/anti-müllerian hormone , insulin-like  <dig> , and testosterone . mis, a hormone belonging to the tgfβ family, is produced by sertoli cells and regulates male sex differentiation by triggering regression of the müllerian ducts, which if left intact would develop into the internal female reproductive tract   <cit> . testosterone, a steroid hormone, secreted by leydig cells and its more potent derivative dihydrotestosterone regulate several key processes that include testicular descent, development of the accessory sex glands and external genitalia, masculinization of the brain, male sexual behavior, and initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis   <cit> . insl <dig>  a small peptide belonging to the insulin/relaxin/growth factor family also produced by leydig cells, regulates the first phase of testis descent during fetal life  <cit>  and acts as a germ cell survival factor in adults  <cit> .

although the testis is the site of spermatogenesis, spermatozoa that exit the testis do not have the capacity to fertilize eggs. the final steps of spermatozoa maturation  occur in the epididymis, a convoluted and androgen-regulated organ composed of one long tubule divided into three distinct regions called caput, corpus and cauda. epididymal segmentation is directly related to its function which is species-conserved  <cit> . in addition to functionality, each region of the epididymal tubule is characterized by a distinct physiology. therefore several genes have been shown to have a region-specific expression along the epididymis tubule  <cit> . in addition to its importance for sperm maturation, the epididymis also serves as a reservoir for spermatozoa  <cit> .

the process of testis and epididymis formation, as for organogenesis of all tissues, relies on a network of hormones and signaling molecules that act by regulating expression of genes involved in specifying the unique features and functions of these tissues. some of these genes encode transcription factors. in recent years, some homeoproteins have been implicated in testicular and epididymal development and include emx <dig>  <cit> , lhx <dig>  <cit> , pbx <dig>  <cit> , arx  <cit> , hoxa <dig>  <cit> , and pax <dig>  <cit> .

here we report the identification, through a degenerate pcr approach, of additional homeobox factors expressed in the male reproductive system. in addition, we have performed a detailed characterization of the expression profile during testicular and epididymal development of one of the homeoprotein identified, the ladybird-like homeobox  <dig>  homeoprotein.

RESULTS
to identify novel homeoproteins in the male reproductive system, we used a degenerate pcr strategy . a mixture of degenerate primers designed to amplify the homeodomain region was used along with cdnas from mouse leydig cells and epididymis as template. as shown in fig.  <dig>  a  <dig> bp fragment corresponding to the homeodomain was successfully amplified. because degenerate primers were used, this band is likely composed of various homeodomain sequences. to determine the nature of these homeodomains, the pcr products were subcloned and several independent clones were sequenced. as shown in table  <dig>  we found nearly a dozen different homeoproteins in leydig cells and six in the epididymis. some of these homeoproteins belong to the hox family but the majorities are non-hox homeoproteins . interestingly, none of the non-hox homeoproteins had previously been reported in leydig cells and in the epididymis, although some  have been detected in the urogenital ridge/testis  <cit> . to confirm that some of the non-hox homeoproteins identified in our screen are indeed expressed in male reproductive organs, rt-pcrs with sequence-specific primers  were performed using cdna from testicular tissues and cell lines  as well as from the three regions of the epididymis . as shown in the left panel of fig.  <dig>  prx <dig>  dmbx <dig>  and gbx <dig> were detected in all testicular cell lines/tissues tested while lbx <dig> and emx <dig> were only detected in some testicular cell lines . lbx <dig> was present in adult mouse testis as well in the leydig cell lines ma- <dig> and mltc- <dig> whereas emx <dig> was detected in ma- <dig> and tm <dig> leydig cell lines. in the epididymis, all homeoproteins analyzed by this technique were detected . our results are consistent with previous data reporting expression of emx <dig> and dmbx <dig> in the urogenital system and testis  <cit> . since lbx <dig> was detected in both tissues and since scarce information was available regarding its expression in the reproductive system, this homeobox factor was chosen for further analyses.

lbx <dig> is the second member of a family that also comprises lbx <dig> and lbx <dig>  the mammalian lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> gene are the homologs of the drosophila ladybird genes ladybird late  and ladybird early . ladybird-like genes were also identified in the chick embryo, lbx <dig> and lbx <dig>  which share a high degree of homology with mammalian lbx genes  <cit> . in drosophila, lbl and lbe have been shown to play important roles in neurogenesis, myogenesis, and cardiogenesis  <cit> . a consensus dna binding site for lbl and lbe proteins, rvytaayhag, was recently identified  <cit> . this motif was then used in a chip-enriched in silico target approach  that led to the identification of several target genes regulated by the ladybird factors in drosophila  <cit> . these genes were found to encode proteins involved in cardiac and muscle cell fate specification as well as in cell shape, adhesion, and motility  <cit> . interestingly, in mammals lbx <dig> was reported to play equally important roles. indeed, lbx1-/- mice have important defects in heart looping  <cit> , interneuron specification in the spinal cord  <cit> , and migration of muscle cell precursors  <cit> . as for lbx <dig>  its role in chick remains unknown and no mammalian homolog has been identified yet.

to confirm lbx <dig> expression in the testis and epididymis, we initially performed real time rt-pcr using primers specific for lbx <dig> on first strand cdnas from various sources. we used cdnas from a panel of cell lines corresponding to leydig and sertoli cells and found that lbx <dig> was expressed at similar levels in all cell lines tested, except for mltc- <dig> leydig cells which express higher levels of lbx <dig> . similar results for the leydig cell lines were obtained by northern blot . to gain insights into the developmental expression profile of lbx <dig> in the testis, real time pcr was performed on cdnas isolated from testes at various embryonic and postnatal developmental stages. as shown in the right panel of fig. 3a, we found that lbx <dig> was present at all stages tested. lbx <dig> mrna was detected at embryonic day  <dig> , peaked by e <dig> and postnatal day  <dig> , and subsequently decreased by p <dig> to a level that remained stable throughout adult life . a similar real time pcr approach was used to assess lbx <dig> expression in the epididymis. as shown in the left panel of fig. 3b, lbx <dig> mrna was expressed at similar levels in the three regions of the adult mouse epididymis . lbx <dig> was also expressed at a constant level throughout embryonic and postnatal epididymal development .

although the presence of lbx <dig> in the testis and epididymis has been confirmed , the exact cell type expressing this factor within these tissues remained uncertain. to answer this question, we analyze lbx <dig> expression and localization by in situ hybridization on tissue sections using a dig-crna probe. each in situ hybridization analysis was performed using three different crna probes which all gave similar results. consistent with the real time pcr data , lbx <dig> is already expressed in the developing male gonad and mesonephros at e <dig> in the mouse . in the mesonephros, lbx <dig> is present in cells of the wolffian duct , the anlagen of several male reproductive organs, including the epididymis. staining is also detected in the lateral part of the mesonephros which would be in agreement with the location of the degenerating müllerian duct  at that age  <cit> . in the testis, lbx <dig> specifically labels cells within the developing seminiferous tubules  and not the interstitial cells . our findings are in agreement with previous data in the literature where lbx <dig> was reported to be expressed in several embryonic tissues, including the urogenital ridge between e <dig>  and e <dig>  in the mouse  <cit> . no information, however, is available regarding lbx <dig> expression in reproductive organs at later developmental stages and in adult animals.

to address this issue, we performed in situ hybridization throughout fetal and postnatal testicular development in the mouse. lbx <dig> mrna was detected in cells within the seminiferous tubules at all ages tested . in the embryonic  and neonatal  testis, the lumen of the tubules is positive for lbx <dig>  which indicates expression in sertoli cells since at this age their cytoplasm is known to fill the tubule before the onset of spermatogenesis. this was further confirmed by comparing lbx <dig> mrna staining with that of the mis protein, a well-known marker of sertoli cells specifically found in the cytoplasm . gonocytes, located in the tubules, are not labeled for lbx <dig> as their small and round cytoplasm can easily be seen as an unlabelled halo around their large nucleus . later during postnatal development , lbx <dig> expression remained high in cells within the seminiferous tubules that can be identified as sertoli cells  by comparing with mis immunostaining . in addition, some germ cells are also positive for lbx <dig> at p <dig> . since sertoli cells are the main supporting cells for testicular development and spermatogenesis  <cit> , our data would be consistent with a role for lbx <dig> in these processes. in addition to its expression in cells of the seminiferous tubules, lbx <dig> could also be detected in interstitial cells. low staining could be consistently detected in interstitial cells between e <dig> and p <dig> . this would indicate that lbx <dig> is weakly expressed in the fetal leydig cell population. fetal leydig cells are responsible for production of androgens during fetal life and are known to disappear within the first week after birth  <cit> . another population of leydig cells, called the adult leydig cell population, begins to differentiate around the second week after birth and is responsible for the production of androgens throughout postnatal life  <cit> . contrary to the fetal leydig cells, we found that lbx <dig> is highly expressed in the adult leydig cell population around p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  whereas in mature animals , leydig cells no longer expressed lbx <dig> . taken together our data indicate that lbx <dig> is expressed at low levels in fetal leydig cells but at high levels during the differentiation of the adult population of leydig cells. this raises the possibility that lbx <dig> could regulate specific steps of the leydig cell differentiation process.

the detection of lbx <dig> expression in cells of the wolffian duct at e <dig>  prompted us to test whether lbx <dig> was expressed in the epididymis during mouse development since this tissue derives from the wolffian duct. the epididymis is a segmented and regionalized organ  <cit>  and homeoproteins, such as the hox proteins, are essential regulators of body plan segmentation in the antero-posterior axis  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  lbx <dig> mrna was detected in all three regions of the epididymis from e <dig> to adulthood. at the cellular level, lbx <dig> was found to be expressed in principal and basal cells of the epididymal epithelium in adult male mice . lbx <dig> did not label clear and narrow cells . interestingly, we found that lbx <dig> shows a highly compartmentalized expression profile in the caput and corpus epididymis . indeed, in the caput, which is a highly segmented region of the epididymis  <cit> , lbx <dig> was found to be more abundantly expressed in segment  <dig>  and  <dig>  compared to segment  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> . similarly, lbx <dig> expression was stronger in the proximal than in the distal corpus . so far, only a handful of homeoproteins have been shown to have regionalized expression in the male reproductive tract and most of them belong to the hox or meis  families  <cit> . other transcription factors such as pea <dig> and rhox <dig>  are also known to be differentially expressed along rodent epididymis  <cit> . to this date however, only hoxa <dig> and hoxa <dig> have been shown to be involved in segment identity in vivo the mouse epididymis  <cit> .

although lbx <dig> was found to be strongly expressed in both tissues throughout development into adulthood, we did not detect expression of the highly related lbx family member lbx <dig> . this is consistent with the fact that lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> do not have overlapping expression patterns in general  <cit>  and are therefore believed to play non-redundant roles during development. the expression pattern of lbx <dig> in the testis and epididymis described herein supports the notion that this transcription factor might be involved in the development and/or the function of these organs. while this manuscript was in preparation, lbx <dig> null mice have been reported  <cit> . surprisingly, lbx2-/- mice are viable and show no gross morphological defects and both male and female lbx2-/- mice were found to be fertile, although no detailed analyses of the reproductive system were reported  <cit> . a mild partial lethality associated with lbx <dig> deficient mice was however observed but failed to reach statistical significance  <cit> . as suggested by wei et al, back crossing the lbx <dig> mutation in a different genetic background may be required to detect a phenotype associated with lbx <dig> deficiency  <cit> . besides the genetic background, this lack of a penetrant phenotype might be explained by a redundancy mechanism where another homeobox factor could compensate for the absence of lbx <dig>  this is very common amongst genes that are essential for development and cell differentiation, including homeobox encoding genes  <cit> . wei et al proposed that the tlx <dig> homeobox gene is an attracting candidate as a substitute for lbx <dig> for several reasons. first, tlx <dig> and lbx <dig> belong to the superclass of homeobox proteins  <cit> . second, the genomic location and organization of the tlx <dig> and lbx <dig> genes are conserved in drosophila and mice  <cit> . and finally, tlx <dig> and lbx <dig> expression patterns are overlapping in numerous tissues including the testis  <cit> . besides tlx <dig>  it is also possible that other yet unidentified lbx family members could also compensate for the absence of lbx <dig>  in agreement with this is the identification of lbx <dig> in the avian genome, although a mammalian homolog has yet to be identified  <cit> . if it does indeed exist, this other lbx family member would represent an interesting candidate to compensate for the absence of lbx <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our present study provides new insights into the expression profile of the homeobox factor lbx <dig> throughout development of the testis and the epididymis. the lack of overt phenotype in lbx <dig> null mice may indicate that lbx <dig> does not play a dominant role in the development and the function of these organs. another possibility is that other homeobox factors compensate for the absence of lbx <dig>  since lbx <dig> expression is dynamic in the testis and epididymis, lbx <dig> constitutes a useful molecular marker for histological and developmental studies.
