BACKGROUND
the birth of new neurons in the adult brain takes place in discrete regions, especially in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. following brain insults like stroke, this neurogenic region consistently boosts the generation of newborn neurons  <cit> , but the mechanisms and functional role of this complex cellular response is only poorly understood. the subgranular zone  of the dentate gyrus accommodates distinct precursor cell subtypes: radial glial-like type  <dig> cells  give rise to type  <dig> neuronal progenitors  which undergo selection and maturation into functional neurons   <cit> . these cell types differ in their morphology, proliferative activity, migratory behaviour and expression of different key marker antigens  <cit> . type  <dig> cells show a characteristic morphology with a triangle-shaped soma, long and strong apical processes reaching into the granular cell layer and astrocytic properties. those radial glia-like cells express precursor cell markers like nestin and additional the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein . transient amplifying precursor cells  arising from type  <dig> cells still express nestin but lack gfap. type  <dig> cells have plump, short processes orientated parallel to the subgranular zone. afterwards the precursor cells lose their nestin expression and are only positive for doublecortin  comprising a transition from a proliferative stage to postmitotic immature neurons. the proliferative activity is significantly increased with the expression of dcx  <cit> . after exit from the cell cycle the terminal postmitotic differentiation occurs and the cells express markers of mature neurons. the survival of new neurons is determined during the first  <dig> weeks after their birth  <cit>  and is strongly regulated by neuronal network activity  <cit> . neurons that have survived this period are incorporated into the hippocampal network  <cit> . in a previous study we demonstrated that the proliferation of distinct precursor cells in the dentate gyrus increases after focal cortical infarcts  <cit> .

in the present study we further analyzed whether precursor cells constitutively proliferating prior to infarct induction contribute to post-ischemic neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. therefore, the proliferation marker brdu was injected before a focal ischemic infarct was photochemically induced in the forelimb sensorimotor cortex of adult transgenic nestin-gfp mice . these transgenic mice, expressing gfp under the nestin promoter allow a clear identification of distinct nestin-positive precursor subpopulations  <cit> . using this approach, we demonstrate that focal cortical infarcts sequentially increase newly generated precursor cell subtypes compared to sham-operated controls. we thereby provide evidence that hippocampal precursor cells already generated before the infarct contribute to post-ischemic neurogenesis.

RESULTS
all photothrombotically lesioned animals  had typical cortical infarcts located in the sensorimotor cortex according to paxinos  <cit>  . the infarcts impaired all cortical layers leaving the subcortical white matter intact. no structural lesions were observed in sham-operated controls .

to study the recruitment of proliferative cells by cortical infarcts young adult animals received injections of the proliferation marker brdu at  <dig> consecutive days prior to the induction of focal cortical infarcts or sham surgery . the number of brdu-labelled cells was quantified at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post surgery in the subgranular zone . in both experimental groups the number of brdu-positive cells declined from day  <dig>  reaching  <dig> to 32% at day  <dig> after surgery . the slight, but significant increase in number of brdu-positive cells in control animals from day  <dig> to day  <dig> is probably caused by unspecific group differences due to a relatively small group size of  <dig> animals. quantification of brdu-positive cells revealed no significant differences between lesioned and sham-operated animals at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  but we detected an increased survival of brdu-positive cells at day  <dig>  as well as at day  <dig>  post infarct compared to controls .

furthermore we analyzed whether cortical infarcts affect distinct precursor cell populations which already took up brdu prior to the infarct. triple-immunocytochemistry with antibodies against brdu, gfp and gfap or dcx revealed four types of mitotically active precursor cell populations  <cit>  corresponding to the classification described by kempermann and colleagues  <cit>  . type  <dig> cells express gfap and nestin-gfp and generate nestin-gfp-positive type  <dig> cells lacking gfap. type  <dig> cells exist in two subtypes, one negative  and one positive for dcx . type 2b cells divide into type  <dig> cells which are only positive for dcx. newborn mature granule neurons were identified using antibodies against brdu and neun.

quantification of these distinct cell types revealed a similar time-course for both experimental groups at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post surgery . moreover, after focal cortical infarcts we detected a sequential increase of brdu-positive type 2a cells at day  <dig>  of type  <dig> cells/immature neurons at day  <dig> and of neun-positive cells at day  <dig> . at day  <dig> post surgery the numbers of the precursor cell populations were similar in lesioned and sham-operated animals . dcx-positive type 2b  and type  <dig> cells/immature neurons  exhibited the highest numbers of the brdu-expressing cells . the number of brdu-positive type 2b cells decreased at day  <dig>  whereas newborn type  <dig> cells/immature neurons remained on the same level and mature neurons increase . at this time point the number of newborn type 2a cells showed a 3-fold enhancement in lesioned animals compared to controls . from day  <dig> the numbers of brdu-positive type 2b, type 3/immature neurons  and mature neurons decrease in both groups . but cortical infarcts increase the number of newborn type  <dig> cells/immature neurons at day  <dig>  and mature neurons at day  <dig>  compared to controls . in contrast to the developmentally later precursor subtypes and mature neurons, the brdu-expressing type  <dig> and type 2a cells revealed low numbers at all experimental time points in lesioned and control mice .

in order to analyze whether changes in proliferative activity of type 2a cells and type  <dig> cells/immature neurons contribute to the increase of newborn neurons, we additionally stained for ki <dig> as an endogenous proliferation marker . using this approach we detected no differences in number of ki67-expressing type 2a cells at day  <dig> and type  <dig> cells/immature neurons at day  <dig> in animals with cortical infarcts and sham-operated controls . these data support our observation that the infarct favours the differentiation and survival of precursor cells constitutively proliferating prior to the insult.

taken together, our findings demonstrate that focal cortical infarcts affect precursors generated already before the infarct and significantly enhance their survival.

discussion
the present findings support our previous reports that small cortical infarcts increase neurogenesis in the young dentate gyrus mainly by promoting the survival of newborn cells  <cit> . several studies already demonstrated that focal ischemia stimulates the proliferation of dentate precursor cells after infarct induction  <cit> . we here provide novel data that precursor cells which constitutively divide prior to the infarct significantly contribute to post-lesional neurogenesis. this finding is in agreement with a previous study showing that epileptic activity stimulates dentate precursor cells actively proliferating before the insult  <cit> . in this study, brdu-labelling one day prior to seizure induction resulted in increased numbers of brdu-positive cells at days  <dig> to  <dig> and led to more immature neurons at days  <dig> to  <dig> after injury. the time-course of this proliferative response was only slightly delayed after focal cortical infarcts, probably due to different lesion mechanisms. however, large infarcts induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery enhance precursor cell proliferation  <dig> to  <dig> days after the lesion  <cit> .

in agreement with kempermann and colleagues  <cit>  we found a non linear decline of brdu-positive cells in our control animals. this group described a survival of approximately 20% of brdu-expressing cells  <dig> weeks after a period of brdu-injections compared to day  <dig> which is in accordance with our study. the decrease of brdu-dcx-expressing cells in controls from day  <dig> until day  <dig> post surgery  in our study is also consistent with a report from brown and colleagues  <cit>  indicating a similar decline mainly between  <dig> and  <dig> days after brdu-injections. additionally the proportion of mature neurons among brdu-positive cells  <dig> weeks after brdu-labelling in a previous report  <cit>   is similar to our findings .

the numbers of newborn precursor cell subtypes increase sequentially after the infarct with exception of type 2b cells which were not enhanced at any time point. type 2a cells give rise to type 2b cells which than generate type  <dig> cells. cortical infarcts increased the number of newborn type 2a cells at day  <dig>  enhanced type  <dig> cells/immature neurons at day  <dig> and mature neurons at day  <dig> after infarcts. we further demonstrate that the enhancement of the newborn mature neurons is mainly caused by an enhanced differentiation and survival of precursor cells born already before the infarct since we could not detect any changes in proliferative activity of these distinct cell types. it is possible that we missed a change in the number of type 2b cells. additionally the absolute number and proliferation rate of the precursor cells might change after infarcts leading to an alteration of type 2b cells which was not detected in our study. we previously demonstrated that proliferation rates and absolute numbers of distinct precursor cell populations differ under physiological conditions  <cit> . type  <dig> and type 2a cells exhibit higher absolute cell numbers but fewer dividing cells compared to later precursor cell populations.

the mechanisms of post-ischemic neurogenesis are still only poorly understood. glutamatergic mechanisms have been shown to be involved in ischemia-mediated neurogenesis  <cit> . also interruption of neuronal pathways by stroke may provide a trigger for neurogenesis because induction of hippocampal seizure activity by unilateral perforant path stimulation bilaterally increased dentate neurogenesis  <cit> . recent studies provide evidence that unilateral lesions of the entorhinal cortex, the main excitatory input of granule cells, do not alter the proliferation in the dentate gyrus but bilaterally enhance the survival of newborn neurons  <cit> . this bilateral increase was also detected in several previous studies using the same model for ischemia as in the present study  <cit> . furthermore, diffusible and humoral factors might contribute to the neurogenic response in the dentate gyrus  <cit> . the activation of the transcription factor camp response element-binding protein  seems to play an important role for the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus under physiological conditions  <cit>  as well as after ischemia  <cit> . moreover, n-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor-mediated network activity contributes to the selective survival of newborn neurons  <cit> .

to elucidate the functional role of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus a number of hypotheses have been developed  <cit> . it remains still unexplained why the adult brain responds to insults like stroke with an increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. moreover, increased levels of newborn granule cells generated in the dentate gyrus after stroke correlate with better functional outcomes in several models of focal ischemia when the animals received different types of rehabilitative training  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the present study provides evidence that focal cortical infarcts affect hippocampal precursor cells, constitutively proliferating prior to infarct induction and enhance their survival. these alterations significantly contribute to increased neurogenesis and elucidate a new aspect of the complex neurogenic response of the dentate gyrus after brain ischemia.
