BACKGROUND
chlamydophila abortus  is the most common infectious bacteria causing abortion in small ruminants in switzerland with a previous study demonstrating that 39% of the examined abortions in sheep and 23% in goats were caused by this agent  <cit> . in the swiss canton of graubünden, a mountainous region in the countries' east, the economic losses associated with ovine enzootic abortion  are significantly higher than in other cantons  <cit> .

cp. abortus is generally introduced into immunologically naïve flocks by a latently infected animal with the agent being subsequently transmitted from aborting ewes via shedding of large amounts of infectious chlamydia in the foetal membranes and in vaginal discharges  <cit> . in newly infected flocks, up to 30% of ewes may abort in the last trimester of gestation or give birth to weak or dead lambs. after abortion, ewes in these flocks may develop a protective immunity. subsequent yearly losses in endemically infected flocks may decrease to a lower level  with sheep either born into the flock or newly introduced animals likely to suffer abortions during their initial pregnancies  <cit> .

prevention and control of oea is achieved by vaccination and/or treatment with oxytetracyclines  <cit> . two vaccines against chlamydial abortion are licensed in switzerland by the federal veterinary office  in berne. the first of these available was an egg-grown, formalin-inactivated, whole-organism vaccine  which reduces the incidence of abortion in vaccinated herds but not completely  <cit> . since december  <dig>  an avirulent, temperature-sensitive, live chlamydia vaccine , which is marketed to induce strong long-lasting protection, has been made commercially available in switzerland. the attenuated strain 1b, which forms the basis of this vaccine, was obtained from the virulent cp. abortus strain ab <dig> by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis  <cit> .

in  <dig>  a small pilot study was undertaken to determine if administration of vaccines to protect sheep flocks from oea would result in antibody levels in the complement-fixation test  and in the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  tests similar to those following natural infection  <cit> . after vaccination with the inactivated vaccine  only one sheep developed a detectable antibody response. in contrast, vaccination with the attenuated live vaccine  resulted in detectable antibody titers in all tested sheep.

the aim of this study is to investigate a larger number of sheep over a two-year period in the field to compare flock-level elisa responses between  vaccinated ,  naturally infected and  non-infected sheep flocks. it was anticipated that the follow up study of the humoral responses could possibly discriminate between vaccinated and naturally oea-infected sheep. an additional objective of the study was to attempt to detect chlamydiae and/or the attenuated strain of cp. abortus used in the live vaccine in conjunctival swabs of sheep.

2non-vaccinated group

all ewes  of flock a were serologically positive after vaccination showing a high median antibody value of  <dig> %. the median antibody level of positive sheep  decreased marginally to  <dig> % in autumn  <dig>  in spring  <dig> and autumn  <dig>  the seroprevalence in the flock was 73% . the median antibody value of the positive sheep was  <dig> %  and  <dig> % .

in spring  <dig>  two years after the first vaccination, six out of  <dig> vaccinated sheep in flock b had a positive serological result , whereas two out of  <dig> non-vaccinated sheep in the same flock were positive. the number of positive sheep decreased to three and two in the vaccinated group  in autumn  <dig> and spring  <dig>  respectively. in the non-vaccinated group, one sheep tested positive in autumn  <dig>  but none in spring  <dig>  in autumn  <dig>  the number of positive sheep increased in the vaccinated  and non-vaccinated  group, although abortions were not reported. the mean antibody values in the two groups were comparable, both being slightly greater than 60%.

flock c  served as the positive control. the seroprevalence in sheep in spring  <dig> was high at 82% . the median antibody value in the positive group was  <dig> %. the seroprevalence remained continuously high  during the whole study period and median antibody values in positive sheep were above 70%. in autumn  <dig> newborn lambs were largely negative and had a significantly lower median antibody value than older ewes  . the ewe with the confirmed chlamydial abortion in spring  <dig> had positive antibody levels for the remaining sampling period comparable to the other animals in the flock . the seroprevalence in goats after confirmed chlamydial abortion in all four animals in spring  <dig> was 100%  with a high median antibody value of  <dig> % . in contrast to the sheep, all goats remained serologically positive with very high antibody values  over the whole testing period .

flock d served as the negative control for this study. despite this, 21%  of the ewes showed positive results in spring  <dig>  whereas 44%  of the ewes had negative serological results and 35%  of animals showed questionable readings. the median antibody values of the positive animals were  <dig> %. half a year later, in autumn  <dig>   <dig> animals continued to be serologically positive. in spring  <dig>  the seroprevalence increased to 46%, whereas the mean antibody values of the positive animals were comparable to spring and autum  <dig> . in autumn  <dig>  the number of serologically positive ewes decreased to 30% , whereas the mean antibody value of positive sheep increased to  <dig> %.

prior to vaccination in spring  <dig>  only one animal in flock e was positive in the vaccination group , whereas  <dig> sheep  were positive in the non-vaccinated group . all  <dig> sheep of the vaccinated group were serologically negative in autumn  <dig> and therefore selected for vaccination in winter  <dig>  the non-vaccinated group showed seroprevalences between 38–48% from autumn  <dig> to  <dig> and median antibody values of positive animals were consistently between  <dig> – <dig> %. in comparison to vaccinated sheep in flock a, none of the animals vaccinated in winter  <dig> were serologically positive in spring  <dig>  in autumn  <dig>  one ewe had a positive antibody value of  <dig> %, whereas the other  <dig> vaccinated sheep had negative  or questionable values .

statistical comparison of mean titers
in flocks a , c and d , differences in titer values between the sampling periods were always highly significant in the rm anova model . in flock b, with a vaccination date between sampling periods  <dig> and  <dig>  both vaccination status and an interaction term between vaccination and visit were statistically significant . in flock e, in which vaccination took place before the first sampling, both main effects were significant , while the interaction term was not.

pcr results of eye swabs
in flock e,  <dig> conjunctival swabs were collected before application of the live vaccine in autumn  <dig>  no obvious signs of ocular surface diseases such as conjunctivitis and keratitis were observed in any animal. igs-s pcr screening detected  <dig> samples that were positive for chlamydial dna. sequencing of these pcr products identified  <dig> samples that shared greater than 98% sequence similarity to cp. abortus . one sample each was revealed to be positive for cp. pecorum  and cp. felis . the identity of two samples could not be determined.

five months after vaccination, in spring  <dig>   <dig> eye swabs were sampled in the same flock.  <dig> samples were tested positive by the igs-s pcr but all were from non-vaccinated ewes. of these samples, 5/ <dig> were positive for cp. abortus  while three were positive for cp. pecorum . the identity of four samples could not be determined. none of the vaccinated sheep showed a positive igs-s pcr result and it was concluded that no excretion of the vaccine strain had occurred.

discussion
this study represents the first longterm chlamydial serological study comparing vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks in switzerland. the investigations were undertaken in the canton graubünden, where numerous chlamydial abortion cases in sheep were previously reported  <cit>  and the highest seroprevalence  for cp. abortus in swiss cantons was observed  <cit> .

the results obtained from this study confirm the previous observations of the pilot study  <cit>  that serology  cannot be used to distinguish between sheep vaccinated with the live attenuated vaccine and naturally-infected sheep. the antibody value range in the recently vaccinated flock a was comparable to flock c in which acute infections of cp. abortus occured at the same time. in flock a, very high antibody levels  were visible in every vaccinated sheep , whereas antibody levels of sheep in the previous pilot study were somewhat lower   <dig> days post vaccination  <cit> . as chlamydial abortion was reported in flock a in the past, sheep could have been already serologically positive before vaccination and the very high antibody levels could represent an overlay of both abortion and vaccine-associated antibody values. the mean antibody value of positive animals decreased in both flocks  from spring  <dig> to spring  <dig>  a chlamydial abortion was diagnosed in one goat from flock c in autumn  <dig> explaining the increasing seroprevalence and antibody value in this group of animals at that time. the antibody values in the goats of flock c after an acute infection with cp. abortus were higher and persisted at a very high level  over the observation period compared to the situation in sheep. no correlation with protection was seen however, as a chlamydial abortion occurred in a seropositive goat which had previously aborted. this observation was also made in other goat flocks in canton graubünden . goats treated with the live vaccine also aborted. in general, it is known that if chlamydiae are introduced in a naive flock, the losses are much higher in goats  than in sheep . the differences between goats and sheep are consistent with previous records and to date remain unexplained  <cit> .

antibody levels of vaccinated ewes of flock b ranged from negative to positive two and three years after vaccination, respectively. questionable antibody levels are either attributed to undiagnosed cp. pecorum infections  <cit>  or are possibly due to the vaccination in spring  <dig>  in a similar situation to the naturally infected sheep , a slow decrease of antibody values was observed over the sampling period. this observation strongly suggests that serology  cannot be used to distinguish between sheep vaccinated with the live attenuated vaccine and naturally-infected sheep as anticipated in the previous pilot study  <cit> . as a direct consequence to this, the confirmation of negative oea status in vaccinated animals by serology cannot be made. this is unfortunate as reliable confirmation is important if an abatement of oea through assembly of oea-free flocks is to be performed as undertaken by the sheep and goat health schemes in england and wales and the premium health scheme in scotland.

positive antibody values have been observed in the negative control flock , which had not been vaccinated and was free from chlamydial abortion. an explanation for the observations of an increasing antibody value amongst this flock is that the animals may have asymptomatic intestinal infections with cp. abortus as presumed in previous studies  <cit> . an alternative scenario is that the ewes were infected with a less virulent strain of cp. abortus, which provokes seroconversion but no abortion  <cit> . fluctuations in the antibody levels could be the result of bacterial shedding during oestrus which provokes an induction of antibody levels without causing abortion  <cit> . unfortunately, little is still known at this time about the ability of cp. abortus to persist in animals  compared to other chlamydial species, which require more investigations.

in flock e, the serological reaction of  <dig> selected vaccinated sheep and the  <dig> non-vaccinated sheep in the flock was evaluated. surprisingly and in contrast to the observations in the previous pilot study  <cit>  and in the two vaccinated flocks a and b, six of  <dig> vaccinated sheep of flock e showed no seroconversion eight months after vaccination. only one ewe had a positive serological result , comparable to the vaccinated sheep of flock a and the naturally oea-infected sheep of flock c. the remaining six ewes had questionable antibody levels. the primary difference between animals in flocks a and e was the high variability of antibody levels in vaccinated animals. these results suggest that individual immunoreactions between sheep can vary considerably.

sampling of conjunctival swabs from sheep in flock e was performed to detect and compare the presence of chlamydial dna before and after vaccination. furthermore, a possible excretion of the vaccine through the eye could be screened with this approach. although chlamydiae were frequently detected by pcr in conjunctival swabs of sheep, the attenuated strain of cp. abortus used in the live vaccine was not detected in swabs collected from vaccinated sheep. the incidence of cp. abortus and cp. pecorum and even c. suis in clinically healthy non-vaccinated sheep was previously observed in a recent study  <cit> . the significance of this possible new mode of transmission for oea needs further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings in our study strongly suggest that serology  cannot be used to distinguish between sheep vaccinated with the live attenuated vaccine and naturally-infected sheep. the course of antibody levels, nevertheless, can vary between individual animals and flocks. compared to sheep, goats displayed higher antibody levels, which persist over a longer time period but do not correlate with protection. the attenuated strain of cp. abortus used in the live vaccine was not detected in eye swabs collected from vaccinated sheep.
