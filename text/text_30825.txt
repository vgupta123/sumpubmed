BACKGROUND
it is estimated that over  <dig>  species of fungi exist, and it is assumed that these species can be found in almost all habitats on earth. however, only a few of these species have been described  <cit> . most fungal species have developed saprophytic interactions in soil and in water or in association with mycorrhizal plants, as either arbuscular mycorrhizae or ectomycorrhizae. moreover, fungal species are known to cause disease in several hosts, including mammals, arthropods, and plants  <cit> . to adapt to such a large variety of habitats, fungi have developed a prolific capability to export proteins to the extracellular space as an important mechanism to acquire nutrients  <cit> . therefore, secretomes, which are defined as the global set of proteins produced by a cell and exported to the extracellular space in a determined time and condition, represent an important target for understanding the mechanisms of fungal adaptation. for instance, both saprophytic and pathogenic fungi must quickly adapt to variations in carbon and nitrogen availability. because fungi generally obtain nutrients from the digestion of extracellular polymers, such as cellulose and chitin, fungi must produce copious amounts of extracellular enzymes to allow for the efficient hydrolysis of biopolymers during the infection process or from their natural environment  <cit> .

a diverse group of fungi is associated with arthropods, the largest class of eukaryotic species on earth, and plays a role in controlling their populations, in particular of insects  <cit> . the most well known insect-associated fungi are entomopathogens, which are necrotrophic fungi that actively penetrate the host exoskeleton and proliferate in the hemocoel until all internal tissues have been degraded. the infection process of entomopathogenic fungi depends on the secretion of a plethora of enzymes and toxins, which serve to penetrate and kill the host, as well as to provide nutrients through the action of biopolymer-degrading enzymes . the best-characterized example of a relation between an entomopathogenic fungus and its hosts is the genus metarhizium. several lines of evidence suggest that the infection cycle of metarhizium can be schematically divided into the following steps:  conidia adherence to the host cuticle through hydrophobic interactions and thin mucilaginous material;  conidia germination and development;  germ-tube differentiation into appressoria;  cuticle penetration;  hyphae differentiation into blastospores/hyphal bodies in the hemolymph;  host colonization;  extrusion to the host cadaver surface; and  conidiophore formation and conidia production  <cit> . the participation of many proteins, including secreted proteins, has been described for the infection process . more recently, the existence of alternative mechanisms has been suggested during the control of aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of dengue and yellow fever  <cit> . because different metarhizium species can infect and kill more than  <dig> species from  <dig> insect and arthropod families  <cit> , some isolates have been widely used as bioagents to control a wide variety of pests  <cit> . indeed, almost  <dig> different formulations employing metarhizium are commercially available  <cit> .

in fact, the metarhizium species generally regarded as m. anisopliae is composed of nine different species, which can be most frequently isolated from either soil or insects  <cit> . the genomes of the m. anisopliae arsef  <dig>  which are currently classified as m. robertsii <cit> , a broad-spectrum insect pathogen, and of the acridid-specific m. acridum cqma  <dig>  were characterized  <cit> . the sequence analysis of these genomes revealed that they are highly syntenic and possess many genes that allow for the different lifestyles of metarhizium spp. in addition, a phylogenomic analysis showed that m. robertsii and m. acridum are more related to plant endophytes and pathogens than to animal pathogens. moreover, this analysis showed that the sequenced genome was from m. robertsii, which had been misclassified as m. anisopliae <cit> . further information concerning the evolution of entomopathogenic fungi originates from the characterization of the entomopathogen beauveria bassiana genome, which contributed to the identification of a common set of gene families potentially associated with fungal entomopathogenicity  <cit> .

the large collection of fungal genomes sequenced, including entomopathogens, plant pathogens, mycopathogens, and mammal pathogens, allows the shared and exclusive genes present in the predicted secretomes of fungal species to be identified. to analyze the importance of secreted proteins in the virulence of fungal pathogens, we sequenced the genome of m. anisopliae strain e <dig> and performed a comparative study of this genome, emphasizing the predicted secretome among distinct fungal species.

RESULTS
general features and comparative analyses of the m. anisopliaee <dig> genome
the genome sequence of metarhizium anisopliae e <dig> was obtained using a 454-based pyrosequencing approach, with 19-fold genome coverage. the assembly performed using newbler  <dig>  and wgs-ca  <dig>  software resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds with  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> ,426 bp, respectively . the longest scaffold identified using newbler software was  <dig> ,362 bp, whereas the longest scaffold identified using wgs-ca software was  <dig>  bp. using newbler and wgs-ca software, the n <dig> scaffold size was calculated as  <dig>  kb and as  <dig>  kb and the n <dig> contig size was measured as  <dig>  kb and as  <dig>  kb, respectively. both assemblies were combined using the assembly tool minimus <dig>  and the total m. anisopliae genome size was  <dig>  mb . in comparison to other entomopathogenic fungal genomes, m. anisopliae e <dig> has a genome size similar to m. robertsii arsef  <dig> and to m. acridum cqma  <dig> and is larger than the cordyceps militaris cm <dig> and b. bassiana arsef  <dig> genomes . the gc content of m. anisopliae e <dig> is 51%, which is similar to the values reported for m. robertsii, m. acridum, c. militaris and b. bassiana, which are fungi traditionally compared with m. anisopliae. the m. anisopliae e <dig> gene density is  <dig> genes per mbp, which is extremely similar to the values found for the fungi previously cited, with an average of  <dig>  exons per gene. the number of transfer rnas  identified in m. anisopliae e <dig> was  <dig>  which is higher than those trnas found in other fungi . this finding may reflect the use of different methodologies for analyzing other fungal genomes  <cit> , which were assessed using a combination of different predictors, including trnascan-se  <cit>  and infernal  <cit> .table  <dig>

the genome was predicted to have  <dig>  protein-coding genes, a value slightly higher than those values found for m. robertsii , m. acridum  and c. militaris  . there are  <dig>  hypothetical proteins in m. anisopliae e <dig>  which account for  <dig> % of its genome. based on comparisons with previously cited fungi, m. anisopliae e <dig> has  <dig>  exclusive protein coding genes . both host-generalist fungi m. anisopliae e <dig> and m. robertsii show a similar number of exclusive  genes. however, the specialist fungus m. acridum has a significantly higher number of exclusive genes , and c. militaris, the teleomorphic species, has the highest number  of exclusive genes  among these entomopathogens. considering the four fungi,  <dig> %  of all proteins are shared. as expected, m. anisopliae shares more proteins exclusively with m. robertsii  than with m. acridum  or with c. militaris . by excluding all paralogous genes present in each fungal genome, we could analyze the distribution of orthologous genes among the four fungi that presented 1: <dig> ortholog genes, representing 86%  of the shared genes . blast and orthomcl analyses were conducted to evaluate the presence of ortholog sequences in metarhizium spp. and showed that  <dig> % of the m. anisopliae e <dig> coding sequences display matches in m. robertsii and  <dig> % display matches in m. acridum. a broader comparison with the sequences of  <dig> additional fungal genomes revealed that  <dig> sequences are unique to m. anisopliae e <dig>  thus, increasing the number of fungal genomes from  <dig> to  <dig> from the different lifestyles does not significantly diminish the number of exclusive proteins, which are largely classified as hypothetical , suggesting that these proteins may develop specific roles in m. anisopliae that differ from counterparts m. acridum and m. robertsii.figure  <dig>

comparative analysis of genes involved in pathogen-host interactions
to evaluate the presence of genes known and suggested to be involved in pathogenic and virulence pathways, the pathogen-host interaction  database was used to search for orthologous proteins in the m. anisopliae e <dig> genome. comparisons with the predicted proteome of m. anisopliae e <dig> and the phi-database were conducted employing blastp analysis and the results were filtered according a stringent criteria . of the  <dig>  protein-coding genes,  <dig>   exhibited matches with proteins from the phi database. similar percentages of m. robertsii and m. acridum proteins also exhibited matches with the phi databases . however, b. bassiana had a lower percentage of phi database matches . considering only proteins that show over 70% identity with m. anisopliae orthologs,  <dig> of  <dig> matches exhibited a “loss of pathogenicity or reduced virulence” as phenotype characteristics in mutant strains. chitinase chi <dig>  is among the classes of pathogenic proteins represented in m. anisopliae for which mutants exhibited reduced virulence against the cotton bug dysdercus peruvianus <cit> . the m. anisopliae protein mani <dig>  was also found to be a putative virulence factor because this protein is homologous to the chitinase bbchit <dig> from b. bassiana . the overexpression of this gene in b. bassiana led to enhanced virulence against the aphid myzus persicae <cit> . additionally, three chitin synthase coding genes could be identified . m. anisopliae has an orthologous protein  to m. robertsii histidine kinase  <dig> , whose null mutants showed reduced virulence to tenebrio molitor larvae  <cit> . superoxide dismutase , mitogen-activated protein kinases , urease, cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase, and others were also proteins from m. anisopliae with matches in the phi database . therefore, such proteins represent putative virulence determinants and should be exploited in future loss of function mutant experiments.

comparative secretome analyses
we predicted the refined secretome of m. anisopliae e <dig>  and from other  <dig> fungal genomes available, selected from different lifestyles, such as plant pathogens , human pathogens , entomopathogens , and mycopathogens , as well as saprophytes . the goal was to compare the secretome functionalities and to search for evolutionary traits. to perform this task, we combined bioinformatic tools  based on the approach used for the plant pathogen fusarium graminearum <cit> , which has shown high transcriptional and proteomic support. this procedure aimed to detect protein sequences encompassing signal peptides , a lack of or at most one transmembrane domain  if located within the first  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus , and sequences associated with the extracellular face of the plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol  after a post-translational modification . additional cellular localization tools  were applied to refine the secretome predictions. sequences lacking an initial methionine or that were smaller than  <dig> amino acids were excluded. to ensure that sequences known to permanently reside inside the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum were not present, we scanned for the prosite pattern ps <dig> . our analysis relied on the association of different software modalities to improve our prediction specificity because the utilization of single programs would result in more annotation errors. for example, of the sixteen fungal species analyzed,  <dig> % of the proteins predicted to have signal peptides by signalp were not considered secreted proteins by targetp, whereas  <dig> % of the proteins predicted to have extracellular localization by wolf psort were rejected by protcomp. recent reports have revealed that the non-classical export of proteins to the extracellular space through vesicles is a conserved mechanism in fungi . although we are aware that the secretory pathway analyzed in this study does not represent the entire repertoire of fungal secreted proteins, notably, the classical mechanism of protein secretion is an important and well-studied route. the m. anisopliae e <dig> refined secretome represented  <dig> % of the complete proteome. similar proportions were found for all species, ranging from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  . this proportion was much higher in the previously predicted m. robertsii secretome ; however, this number was based solely on the presence of signal peptides  <cit> , suggesting that its secretory repertoire may have been overestimated. in contrast, our method predicted that the m. robertsii secretome accounts for  <dig> % of the complete proteome .

to evaluate the functional diversity of the secretomes studied, we employed classification based on the kegg orthology  database and association of activities with different fungal lifestyles. the amount of predicted secreted sequences associated with functional groups varied from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % , indicating a considerable number of proteins with unknown functions for all fungi genomes. for example, 72% of m. anisopliae e <dig> sequences without ko functions were hypothetical proteins. among the entomopathogens, we found that m. anisopliae e <dig> presented a higher number of glycoside hydrolase  sequences, which contain both canonical signatures to be secreted and distributed to cellular compartments. ghs  are ubiquitous enzymes found in all domains of life. these proteins can be both intra- and extracellular and play fundamental roles in nutrition by degrading a variety of polymeric carbohydrates  <cit> . of note, when compared with fungi with different lifestyles, entomopathogens have relatively fewer ghs, secreted or non-secreted. in fungi, one important class of gh enzymes is the chitinases . these proteins are classified into the gh  <dig> family and are assumed to be involved in insect cuticle degradation and fungi cell wall digestion during morphological changes  <cit> . as expected, our analysis revealed that entomopathogens and mycoparasites displayed a larger set of secreted chitinases. this finding is consistent with a previous report that characterized the presence of distinct gh members in fungal genomes  <cit> . although chitin is absent in mammals and in plants, human pathogens and phytopathogens present a modest set of secreted chitinases that may have antifungal roles  <cit> . in addition, a consistent number of non-secreted chitinases was found most likely because these chitinases have other roles in the fungal life cycle or are able to reach the extracellular space through different secretion mechanisms or by vesicle transport  <cit> .

comparative profiling of secretome by classification of gene ontology terms was also applied in order to obtain functionalities predominant in entomopathogen secretomes in relationship to other fungal lifestyles. the annotations related to proteolysis  and related  could be found as overrepresented in entomopathogens when compared to human and plant pathogens, mycopathogens as well to saprophytes . to establish successful infection, entomopathogens secrete a variety of hydrolytic enzymes, such as proteases . a higher number of secreted proteases in this lifestyle group was found; in m. anisopliae e <dig> and in m. robertsii, these secreted proteases were originated from gene family expansion of serine  and aspartic endopeptidases . although it has more genes coding for trypsin , the m. robertsii genome codes for slightly fewer secreted enzymes of this class  than the m. anisopliae e <dig> genome . considering the two types of hydrolyzing peptide bonds, the exopeptidase  and the endopeptidase  families are widely distributed in all analyzed secretomes.

comparing the predicted secretomes of the three metarhizium species herein analyzed, the acridid-specific m. acridum and the broad host-range m. anisopliae e <dig> and m. roberstii, fewer genes in almost all enzyme categories analyzed were found in m. acridum . this finding is consistent with its narrow range of susceptible hosts. in agreement with this assumption, comparative genome hybridization assays  <cit>  and a comparative genome analysis  <cit>  revealed the absence of several genes in m. acridum compared with m. robertsii. when the secretomes of entomopathogenic fungi were compared with those secretomes from human fungal pathogens, a. niger was found to have the largest repertoire of proteins with a predicted pfam domain.

we reasoned that fungal secretomes could share a common evolutionary trait. to evaluate this hypothesis, we performed a comparison of the predicted secretome employing the  <dig> genomes previously analyzed. this hypothesis was shown to be inconsistent. a reasonable explanation is obtained from comparisons of homologs present in indifferent secretomes for all 405 m. anisopliae e <dig> secreted sequences , as well the analysis of gene duplication  numbers  for each predicted secretome. the number of homologs is reduced from  <dig> for m. robertsii to  <dig> for a. niger, and the duplication rates varied from  <dig> % for t. reesei to  <dig> % for a. niger. the closest secretomes to m. anisopliae e <dig> were the entomopathogens metarhizium spp., b. bassiana and c. militaris, whereas the human pathogens aspergillus spp. was the least similar. the plant pathogen nectria haematococca presented slightly more homologs  than the saprophyte t. reesei , whereas the other trichoderma spp., t. virens and t. atroviride, presented  <dig> and  <dig> homologs, respectively. these latter numbers are consistent with the reduced repertoire of t. reesei secreted protein families  <cit> , including cellulases, hemicellulases and polysaccharide degradation enzymes.figure  <dig>

the inspection of predicted secreted proteins among homolog sequences reveals that any comparative analysis based on simple homology inferences  <cit>  should be conducted with caution. we observed that the speciation process led to differentiation in the orthologous sequences because some direct homologs between two different species differ in the presence of canonical sequences that classify a protein as secreted . n. haematococca showed the smallest percentage of secreted homologs , whereas even the most taxonomically related m. robertsii had a much larger percentage of secreted homologs . considering only secreted homologs , the mycoparasite t. atroviride exhibits more homologs  than the entomopathogens b. bassiana  and c. militaris . a considerable number of homologs, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for f. oxysporum and for t. virens, respectively, had no detectable signal peptide . this finding could represent differences between the n-terminal sequences or alternative start codon predictions  <cit> . additionally, the amplitude between the total predicted secretome , the number of secreted proteins with coding-genes presented in copies , and the total number of homologs reveals an important set of species-specific secreted proteins for each proteome compared with m. anisopliae e <dig> 

the presence of alternative in-frame translation initiation sites  is a common feature that has been experimentally verified in a wide range of organisms  and that may directly influence the cellular localization of proteins  <cit> . alternative tis can occur at distances of hundreds of base pairs from the primary start codon site and has been recently predicted to be a phenomenon that occurs in approximately one-tenth of all saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins  <cit> . in an attempt to detect signal peptides in a downstream methionine, which could be an alternative tis, the m. anisopliae e <dig> predicted proteome and its homolog sequences were split, beginning with all methionines present at the second to the last  <dig> residues to the end of each protein. subsequences were screened for the presence of signal peptides by both signalp and targetp tools and were subsequently divided into two categories:  signal peptides already detected at the first methionine  of the primary sequence and  signal peptides not detected . from the  <dig>  m. anisopliae e <dig> coding sequences analyzed,  <dig>  could be split into subsequences. of these subsequences,  <dig> had signal peptides detected at m <dig> ). for  <dig>  of these  <dig> proteins, an additional signal peptide could be detected , accounting for  <dig> subsequences. approximately  <dig> % of these methionines were located within  <dig> residues of m <dig>  indicating that m <dig> may be the same motif detected, although  <dig> % were located up to  <dig> amino acid residues from m <dig>  for  <dig>  of the  <dig>  proteins from category ii, a signal peptide motif could be identified in a downstream methionine , accounting for  <dig>  subsequences. in  <dig> % of these sequences, an alternative tis was present over  <dig> residues downstream of m <dig>  the same analysis was applied to any proteins classified as secretome-related. of the  <dig>  m. anisopliae e <dig> secretome homologs,  <dig>  could be split into subsequences. then, these sequences could be grouped into categories , with  <dig>  sequences, and , with  <dig> sequences. one hundred and twenty-eight sequences  of the group with  <dig>  proteins ) showed an additional motif , resulting in  <dig> subsequences , of which  <dig> % most likely accounted for the same signal within  <dig> residues of m <dig>  finally, for only  <dig>  of the  <dig> proteins ), a signal peptide was detected downstream of m <dig> , adding  <dig> subsequences to the alternative tis, with  <dig> % within  <dig> residues from m <dig>  together, these results indicate that even if alternative tis is actually occurring in a downstream methionine for these proteins, the majority of homologs without a detectable signal peptide at m <dig> may not be secreted, similar to m. anisopliae e <dig>  again, the possibility of alternative secretion mechanisms cannot be excluded. in fact, these results strongly suggest that such mechanisms exist and may account for the secretion of an important number of proteins.

among the predicted extracellular proteins of m. anisopliae e <dig>  we could identify  <dig> glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins . this post-translational modification has been implicated in protein sorting, trafficking and dynamics in different cells  <cit> . in yeast, gpi lipids are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and their addition to target proteins is conducted by a pathway that is composed of  <dig> steps  <cit> . the number of gpi-ps in m. anisopliae e <dig> is higher than that in other metarhizium spp.  and lower than that in the two other entomopathogens . the majority  of the gpi-ps identified represent conserved hypothetical proteins. however, the gpi-ps of m. anisopliae e <dig> showed considerable functional diversity, as revealed by the analysis of conserved domains . of the  <dig> predicted gpi-ps,  <dig> proteins could be classified as glycoside hydrolases, whose orthologs were characterized in n. crassa <cit> , in a nidulans <cit> , as well in m. robertsii <cit> .

to identify possible gpi-p orthologs shared by the genome sequences of metarhizium spp., we conducted a blast analysis for m. anisopliae e <dig>  m. robertsii and m. acridum. we found that most of the m. anisopliae e <dig> gpi-ps had orthologs in both m. robertsii and m. acridum that also had a gpi anchoring signal. however, in some cases, the gpi-ps from m. anisopliae had orthologs only in either m. robertsii or m. acridum, or even had exclusive proteins . in addition, despite the clear presence of orthologs among the three metarhizium spp., a few orthologous proteins to m. anisopliae e <dig> gpi-ps differed only in the presence or absence of the gpi anchoring signal in the metarhizium spp. counterparts, suggesting a possible difference in their cellular location . these data suggest that there are differences in their protein cell surface profile, despite their phylogenetic proximity. indeed, the differences observed in their gpi-p profiles may represent differences in fungal survival in the environment, virulence and host specificity.

because secretory proteins play a fundamental role in fungi physiology and because their evolution is essential for fungal fitness, gene duplication rates could be significantly higher within secretome genes when compared with the remnant proteome. for the fungal pathogen f. graminearum, genes coding for secreted proteins have been preferentially found in chromosomal regions with higher recombination frequencies  <cit> . additionally, gene duplication is an important source of new biological functions because mutations in one of the copies can affect protein structure without being deleterious, whereas the other copy can retain functionality  <cit> . to evaluate the prediction that secretome coding genes are more susceptible to duplication than the proteome coding genes as a whole, a proportion test was conducted. this analysis supported this hypothesis for the two human pathogens a. fumigatus  and a. niger , for the plant pathogen m. oryzae , for the three saprophytes a. nidulans , n. crassa  and t. reesei  and for the two mycoparasites t. atroviride  and t. virens  . conversely, for n. haematococca , this proportion was inverted, such that secreted protein coding genes had less duplication. this finding was consistent with the percentage found for predicted secreted proteins and with the higher duplication rate in supernumerary chromosomes  <cit> . m. anisopliae is adapted to a diverse range of niches  <cit> , and our analysis revealed that the proportions of duplications for the secretome coding genes compared with the proteome coding genes as a whole are statistically equal. this finding suggests that for entomopathogenic fungi, in contrast to human and plant pathogens, successful adaptation to different habitats may be more qualitative. this hypothesis argues that the presence or absence of specific genes, in contrast to gene duplications, is required for the adaptation of metarhizium spp. to different habitats.

longer  duplicated proteins are more likely to be retained because these proteins have a higher probability of generating new biological functions, as previously observed for several fungal species, including saprophytes and human pathogens  <cit> . considering the mean protein size for all sixteen analyzed fungi species, we found that duplicated genes are larger than single copy genes for both the secreted and non-secreted sequences  and that longer genes have more copies . additionally, independent of the copy number, secreted proteins are generally smaller than the average size of the rest of the proteome . therefore, evolutionary mechanisms for the selection of secreted proteins based on their size must have occurred to allow for their translocation into the extracellular space or to allow for those proteins to function properly in that external environment.figure  <dig>

transcriptome analysis
we conducted the first rna-seq experiment to evaluate the differential gene expression profiles of m. anisopliae e <dig> acting on tick  cuticles to mimic the infection process . these experiments were conducted in three different conditions:  a control condition, with spore suspensions cultured in complete medium for 48 hours ;  an early cuticle infection condition , with tick cuticles inoculated with spore suspensions and incubated for 48 h in water-agar plates; and  a late cuticle infection condition , with tick cuticles inoculated with spore suspensions and incubated for 144 h in water-agar plates. after mapping reads from all three experimental setups to the genome, approximately 89% of the  <dig>  predicted protein coding sequences had at least two uniquely mapped reads . notably, the transcriptome results validated our genome annotation since reads that mapped to  <dig> of the 690 m. anisopliae exclusive genes  could be detected . the statistical package edger  <cit> , which has recently shown better performance considering speed and accuracy than other frequently used tools  <cit> , was used in two pairwise comparisons between the rna samples, revealing distinct patterns of gene regulation in the tree experimental setups. a principal component analysis  showed a satisfactory degree of variability among the biological replicates . the condition mimicking early infection  triggered a higher amount of up-regulated genes ) compared with down-regulated genes ), with similar proportions of predicted secreted sequences . after an additional 4 days of fungal contact with the host cuticle , the scenario was inverted, with more genes down-regulated  than up-regulated , whereas the proportion of the predicted secretome was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. considering secretome genes with more than two mapped reads in any replicate,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were expressed for setups c-48 h, i-48 h and i-144 h, suggesting that most of these proteins may be constitutively expressed in the condition analyzed in this study.figure  <dig>

to observe the possible biological roles of differentially expressed genes, superfamily functional categorization  <cit>  was applied . at least  <dig> different expression profiles could be detected, which encompassed the expression variation of  <dig>  genes. this classification is based on the differential expression of functional categories when comparisons between c-48 h and i-48 h  and i-48 h and i-144 h  were conducted . the majority of the differentially expressed genes fell into category a  or e . neither the a or e profiles showed differences in their gene expression between the i-48 h and i-144 h conditions; however, these profiles contain differences when c-48 h and i-48 h are compared. in all profiles, genes under constant regulation from the categories “ha: small molecule binding” , “rb: transferases”  and “rc: other enzymes” were identified. the “ra: redox” category was also observed in almost all profiles . as described for other metarhizium species  <cit> , the camp response element-binding  protein, which is a major downstream transcription factor in mammals that has not yet been characterized in fungi, was up-regulated . a considerable proportion of “g: carbohydrate metabolism and transport” and “oa: protease” categories in profile b is of note because these categories represent gene products involved in the early stages of infection . moreover, profile b harbored the highest set of genes  coding for proteins predicted to be secreted, which is consistent with the expected function of the secretome . four subtilisins, which are important enzymes for host cuticle degradation and nutrition  <cit> , were detected in this expression profile , along with proteins cas <dig> and mas <dig>  whose orthologs in plant pathogens are known to be involved in appressorium formation  <cit> . continued contact with the cuticle after 144 hours enhanced the expression of categories “a: rna binding, metabolism and transport”, “f: nucleotide metabolism and transport”, “j: translation” and “rd: protein interaction” . trna synthetases, which are the enzymes responsible for charging the correct amino acid to its cognate trna, as well as enzymes acting on ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle progression, were up-regulated  <cit> , indicating that the fungal cells were metabolically active . as the host cuticle is exhausted, proteases are down-regulated , and primary metabolism is reduced. thus, the category “c: energy”, which includes glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle components , was down-regulated, as shown in profile d .figure  <dig>

in this study, two trypsin  isoforms, which are a class of serine proteases, were found to be up-regulated during early infection, consistent with previous findings  <cit> . however, one isoform was highly down-regulated , which could represent differential ambient ph responsiveness  <cit> . all three isoforms were predicted to be secretome components. although trypsins are usually more active at an alkaline ph, aspartic endopeptidases  are more active at an acidic ph. five predicted secreted aspartic endopeptidases presented differential expression levels with distinct responses to the environmental conditions. two were highly down-regulated, whereas the other three were up-regulated during early or late infection . additionally, chymotrypsins, which are another class of proteases that were likely originated from horizontal gene transfer from bacteria  <cit> , were also present in two copies in m. anisopliae e <dig> . the rna-seq analysis revealed that these genes did not present differential transcript levels in the conditions evaluated in this study. although these enzymes are important for tick cuticle chitin degradation and for fungi cell wall remodeling, no chitinase was up-regulated in the conditions analyzed in this study. one chitin synthase  was up-regulated.

the gene that was most down-regulated during the contact period with the host cuticle was a nitrate reductase , which is an enzyme that is essential for reducing nitrate to ammonia. this down-regulation can be explained by the physiological condition of nitrogen starvation faced by the fungal cells, which have been shown to be essential for activating distinct virulence functions in plant pathogenic fungi  <cit> . in accordance, starvation-stress gene a , which is a hydrophobin-like protein that leads to decreased fungal sporulation and virulence when deleted  <cit> , was highly up-regulated .

infection metabolism induction may produce derivatives of reactive oxygen species , which are capable of causing damage to diverse cell components, as byproducts. examples of ros molecules include hydrogen peroxide , superoxide anions  and nitric oxide . as a defense mechanism against this oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase  expression was up-regulated for the conversion of superoxide into o <dig> and h2o <dig>  similarly, catalase  and catalase-peroxidase  expression were up-regulated for h2o <dig> inactivation, and glutathione s-transferase  expression was up-regulated for neutralizing electrophilic substrates. additionally, a thioredoxin reductase  isoform responsible for reducing thioredoxins, which can act as antioxidants by reducing other proteins, was down-regulated. the accumulation of thioredoxin in its oxidized form may also have a protective role because thioredoxin is an effective cysteine oxidant  <cit>  that regulates protein disulfide bond formation in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm, resulting in the downstream regulation of oxidative stress transcriptional factors and chaperones  <cit> . peroxiredoxin, which is also an antioxidant enzyme capable of degrading h2o <dig> , was also down-regulated because this enzyme requires the scarce reduced thioredoxin form for its proper function . for completeness, edger statistical analyses are provided .

phylogenomic analyses
as the content of the predicted secretomes change according to the fungal species analyzed, homology relations were established among m. anisopliae e <dig> and a set of fifteen previously cited fungi to evaluate and to compare the evolutionary patterns of the m. anisopliae genome and secretome. in addition a correlation with the transcriptomic data was conducted. all 1: <dig> ortholog sequences representing different cdss were concatenated, leading to an aligned file containing  <dig> , <dig> amino acid residues. as expected, the metarhizium, trichoderma, fusarium, and aspergillus genera formed monophyletic clusters . the genera neurospora and aspergillus clustered together, with high bootstrap support. additionally, metarhizium and trichoderma formed a statistically well-supported clade in the supermatrix and supertree approaches applied to the shared proteome, which was formed by orthologous proteins only . when considering the major clades obtained using the maximum likelihood  and the distance phylogenetic methods , the trees architectures did not changed significantly.figure  <dig> 
fungal evolutionary history obtained by using a phylogenomic approach. nj methods were employed to all orthologs identified in the fungal genomes . nearest neighbor interchange method with a neighbor-joining  tree calculated from average consensus distances were employed to all orthologs identified in the fungal secretomes . the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  is shown next to the branches. the scale bar represents substitutions of amino acids per site.



some fungal genera, including trichoderma and metarhizium, evolved a variety of nutrition strategies. for instance, some trichoderma species are mycotrophic and, therefore, can grow on living fungi in a process known as mycoparasitism, whereas other species are saprotrophic  <cit> . metarhizium species have already been isolated from diverse habitats, primarily from dead arthropod carcasses but also from mycorrhiza and as endophytic  <cit> . the shared proteome also indicates that the plant pathogens f. graminearum, f. oxysporum and n. haematococca <cit>  are related to the metarhizium clade. wyrebek and coworkers  <cit>  have proposed that metarhizium species show plant-specific rhizosphere associations within a habitat. moreover, m. robertsii was also shown to be an endophyte that stimulates root development  <cit> , thus making the direct transfer of nutrients from fungal to plant cells possible . thus, the phylogenomic analysis presented in this study reveals that determining the life-style of m. anisopliae is far more complex than the global set of genes can predict.

the phylogenomic analysis also indicated that m. anisopliae e <dig> and m. anisopliae arsef  <dig>  now identified as m. robertsii <cit> , share a high number of orthologs. these species formed a statistically well-supported clade, with m. acridum basal to these species, corroborating the results of bischoff and coworkers  <cit> . notably, m. robertsii is morphologically indistinguishable from m. anisopliae. therefore, phylogenetic analysis is critical for establishing the identity of these fungi.

a phylogenetic analysis was conducted for  <dig> ortholog-groups representing all proteins that had been identified as putative constituents of the secretome. the evolution of the secretome indicated an important difference when compared with the evolutionary history of these fungi based on their shared proteome. there is a closer evolutionary relation between the metarhizium clade and that formed by the genera beauveria and cordyceps . consequently, most proteins secreted by metarhizium species are similar to those proteins from the beauveria and cordyceps genera. these proteins, some of which are important to the infection process, have a pattern of evolution that is extremely similar in fungi with similar hosts.

to identify the proteins responsible for the distinctive evolutionary pattern of the secretome, all individual phylogenies had their topologies compared with the topology of the phylogenomic tree. at least one metarhizium and one trichoderma sequence, as well as one cordyceps or beauveria sequence, had to be present in a specific secretome ortholog file to be included in the analysis. finally,  <dig> secreted proteins were identified as being potentially responsible for the different pattern of evolution of the secretome when compared with the evolution of the organisms represented by the phylogenomic tree. these proteins may explain why fungi with similar hosts cluster together. thirty four  of those genes are expressed, and  <dig>  of those genes are differentially expressed during early cuticle infection  and/or during late cuticle infection  . the biological significance of these findings requires further investigation. nevertheless, our results show that specific secreted proteins from metarhizium, beauveria and cordyceps species, have an evolutionary history that points for their adaptability to host infection.

using either proteome or secretome data, m. oryzae and n. crassa form a basal cluster with high bootstrap support. these species belong to the distinct orders magnaporthales and sordariales, respectively, and our results corroborate a previous study that noted their evolutionary relation  <cit> . the aspergillus genus, which belongs to the eurotiomycetes order, clusters with the m. oryzae and n. crassa clades and, together, represents the most basal clade in our study. the operational taxonomic units belonging to hypocreales also form a cluster. these results indicate that the orthologs identified for the proteome and for the secretome have an evolutionary pattern that is consistent with the actual taxonomic classification of fungi.

CONCLUSIONS
the m. anisopliae e <dig> genome and expression profiling analyses provide insights into the molecular mechanisms for adapting to the distinct lifestyles of this entomopathogenic fungus. the comparative analyses presented in this study reveal that metarhizium spp. genomes harbor a complex set of genes coding for secreted proteins. such secreted proteins appear to have been selected and maintained in the genome to cope with the distinct lifestyles presented by metarhizium spp., which can be either entomopathogen-, endophytic- or rhizosphere-associated. the transcriptome profiling of m. anisopliae exposed to infection-mimicking conditions compared with laboratory growth conditions showed many genes that were differentially expressed. among these genes, many genes coding for secreted proteins could be found, which could represent m. anisopliae virulence determinants. our results offer selected sequences for further characterization of secreted proteins with potential roles in the m. anisopliae infectious process.
