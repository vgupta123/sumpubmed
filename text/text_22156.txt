BACKGROUND
in response to neural pathologies, glia display reactive properties associated with wound healing including cellular hypertrophy, proliferation, migration and cytokine release  <cit> . in mammalian cns and retina, reactive glia contribute to neural tissue repair  <cit>  but also to neural dysfunction, scar formation, abberant neural rewiring, and vascular remodeling  <cit> , ultimately exacerbating neuronal degenerations  <cit> . defining the components of reactive gliosis that are detrimental to neuronal survival and tissue integrity is an important goal but difficult to achieve. animal models of reactive gliosis also induce neuronal cell death, microglial reactivity, inflammatory responses or tissue damage  <cit> . an alternate approach to explore glial reactivity and neuronal metabolism, physiology and function is to develop genetically inducible models of reactivity in the absence of gross degenerative cues.

two hallmarks of reactive glia are proliferation and enhanced intermediate filament expression. both are associated with opposing properties: neuroprotection and degeneration. experimental models and gene inactivation studies implicate upregulation of intermediate filament expression in the formation of hypertrophic glial processes. glial hypertrophy helps maintain the structural integrity of the cns by filling the space where neurons die and by restoring damaged protective barriers  <cit> . however, intermediate filaments are abundant in glial scars which are known to impede axonal regeneration  <cit> . chronic upregulation of intermediate filament expression is also correlated with glial metabolic dysfunction and altered neuronal electrophysiology  <cit> . the role of glial proliferation is similarly perplexing. genetic ablation of proliferating glia worsens neurodegeneration  <cit>  while pharmacological inhibition of glial proliferation enhances neuronal survival and function  <cit> . given these complexities, more precise dissections of the links between glial reactivity and progressive neurodegeneration are needed.

the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p <dig> is one such link. it is expressed in many adult glial populations including schwann cells, cortical astrocytes, spinal cord astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and retinal müller glia  <cit> . in germline p27-deficient mice , adult glia can display hallmarks of reactive gliosis  <cit> . in the wild-type retina, quiescent müller glia normally do not express the intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein , but müller glia in p27-/- mice express high levels of gfap and in some instances migrate into the subretinal space  <cit> . this behavior is enhanced by the combinatorial inactivation of p <dig> and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p19ink4d  <cit> . müller glial reactivity and abnormal retinal electrophysiology in p27-/- mice may partly arise from developmental dysregulation as p <dig> is critical for neural development and glial differentiation  <cit> . even so, cns and retinal trauma models support a role for p <dig> in maintaining mature glial cells in a quiescent, supportive state. after acute trauma, cortical astrocytes, spinal cord astrocytes and retinal müller glia downregulate p <dig>  upregulate gfap and re-enter the cell cycle  <cit> . thus p <dig> appears to be a negative regulator of two classic indices of reactive glia: gfap upregulation and proliferation. this implies that selective inactivation of p <dig> could trigger neural remodeling and reprogramming defects in an otherwise normal milieu.

to modulate discrete reactivity indices in the absence of other degenerative stimuli, we induced intermediate filament gfap upregulation, migration, and proliferation in adult müller glia by inactivating p <dig> using a tamoxifen-regulated, cre-loxp system  <cit> . this approach bypassed the developmental requirement for p <dig>  <cit>  as well as the complexities and broad effects of experimentally induced degeneration  <cit> . to address the significance of enhanced discrete reactivity on neuronal survival and function, we surveyed metabolism, retinal electrophysiology, and visual acuity. contrary to our expectations, proliferative and gfap-expressing müller glia did not significantly impair retinal metabolism, electrophysiology, or visual function. thus, our genetic model and the p <dig> pathway offer a new platform to explore how environmental factors involved in neuronal cell stress, microglial activation, inflammatory responses, or blood barrier damage contribute to the transition of resident glia from a supportive to detrimental state.

RESULTS
inducible model of p <dig> deficiency in adult mice
we conditionally targeted the p <dig> coding region in adult mice harboring loxp sites at the p <dig> locus , and expressing a tamoxifen-regulated cre recombinase under the control of the chimeric chicken beta-actin promoter, cagg::creer™   <cit> . since high levels of tamoxifen can be toxic to retinal cells  <cit> , expressing creer™ with a strong promoter facilitated a tamoxifen dose that did not cause neuronal cell death or reactive gliosis . importantly, this dose greatly reduced p <dig> expression in targeted mice . inactivation efficiency was higher in the central retina than in the peripheral retina . these results are consistent with previous recombination studies in adult retina and might reflect variability in creer™ expression or tamoxifen accesibility  <cit> . müller glia failing to undergo p <dig> inactivation allowed us to discriminate between cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects of p <dig> inactivation. while genetic deletion of p <dig> can also occur in neurons expressing creer™, this was likely inconsequential as mature retinal neurons do not express p <dig>  <cit> . thus, our model of p <dig> inactivation displayed optimal experimental conditions to define the role of p <dig> in müller glial reactivity.

p27-deficient müller glia upregulate intermediate filaments
since upregulation of the intermediate filament gfap is a hallmark of glial reactivity, we examined gfap immunoreactivity in retinas from p27l-/l- mice and tamoxifen control mice . tamoxifen control retinas displayed two distinct patterns of gfap expression. in the central retina, astrocytes located at the ganglion cell layer expressed gfap . at the far periphery, radial processes expressed gfap that colocalized with müller glial markers . the patterns of gfap expression in tamoxifen control retinas were consistent with those previously observed in wild-type retinas  <cit> . after p <dig> inactivation, western blots revealed enhanced expression of a 50-kda gfap band and of a lower molecular weight band  which correlated with increased gfap immunoreactivity in müller glia both in the central and peripheral retina . temporal and spatial analyses of gfap-immunoreactivity revealed three distinct patterns of expression . seven days after the start of the p <dig> inactivation protocol, only a small percentage of müller glia  displayed gfap immunoreactivity restricted primarily to the end feet at the ganglion cell layer. three to six weeks after inactivation, almost all müller glia  displayed gfap immunoreactivity throughout their cell bodies. nearly four months after inactivation, the number of gfap+ müller glia  and the extent of gfap immunoreactivity throughout the cell body decreased. we also observed that a small percentage of p27+ müller glia expressed gfap , which suggests that p <dig> inactivation might influence cells through a non-autonomous mechanism. however, the vast majority of gfap expression was observed in p27-deficient müller glia . we also found upregulation of the intermediate filaments vimentin and nestin in p27-deficient müller glia .

p27-deficient müller glia reenter the cell cycle
müller glia do not proliferate under normal conditions in part due to the presence of cell cycle inhibitors such as p <dig>  <cit> . after conditional p <dig> inactivation, however, cells reentered the cell cycle as indicated by the upregulation of proliferative markers pcna, phh <dig>  and mcm <dig>  as well as bromodeoxyuridine  labeling . brdu injections followed by a six week chase revealed that brdu colocalized with müller glial markers sox <dig> and glutamine synthetase  and not with photoreceptor or bipolar markers . while the number of sox9+-glul+ nuclei increased by  <dig> %  the number of glul+ stalks at the inner plexus layer decreased by  <dig> %  . increased glul+ soma density with decreased stalk density was confirmed with ultrathin radial and oblique sections suggesting that proliferative müller glia can retract their stalks before dividing and neither they or their daughters regrow stalks after dividing . these data indicate that p <dig> inactivation in müller glia was sufficient to induce cell cycle entry with a low level of proliferation.

sox <dig> and glul immunoreactivity also revealed that p27-deficient müller glia displaced their nuclei toward the photoreceptor layer . the displacement of müller glial nuclei occured one week after the start of p <dig> inactivation and the ectopic location was irreversible. it is unclear whether the nuclear displacement reflects migration of müller glia or simply interkinetic nuclear migration. evidence supporting migratory-like behavior is the presence of focal and limited extension of gfap+ müller glial endfeet into the photoreceptor segments ; but unlike p27-/- retina  <cit> , p27l-/l- retina displayed continuous outer limiting membrane as seen by the müller glia microvilli marker cd <dig> . in sum, induced p <dig> deficiency results in adult müller glia adopting classic indices of proliferative reactive gliosis: intermediate filament upregulation, cell cycle entry, and migratory-like behavior.

reactive p27l-/l- müller glia provide homeostatic metabolic support
the ability of reactive glia to maintain metabolic support and neuronal function is unclear as reactive glia often downregulate metabolic enzymes during neuronal degenerations  <cit> . we visualized and quantified the metabolic support that glia offer both excitatory and inhibitory neurons--glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid  uptake and their ultimate recycling into glutamine--using computational molecular phenotyping . cmp measures metabolite concentration in n-dimensional space at the single cell level  <cit> . molecular mapping on  <dig> nm sections with silver intensification revealed the spatial distributions of glutamate, glutamine, and glutamine synthetase during the peak of gfap upregulation . the ability of p27-deficient müller glia to metabolize glutamate is so efficient that their somas and their endfeet displayed low levels of glutamate . metabolic maps representing taurine, glutamate and glutamine signals into red-green-blue channels revealed the compartmentalization of glutamate in excitatory neurons such as photoreceptors, bipolar cells and ganglion cells . in these metabolic maps, the highly conserved taurine-glutamine signature of müller glia   <cit>  is maintained in p27l-/l- retina. metabolite pixel values extracted using either the glutamine synthetase signal as a mask or formal multi-channel clustering  <cit>  revealed that p27-deficient müller glia maintained statistically inseparable levels of glutamate and glutamine compared to tamoxifen control retinas . additional markers of glial function including osmoregulation , redox function , retinoid binding , and gaba recyling  were also unchanged . metabolite concentrations and distributions for photoreceptors and retinal pigmented epithelium were comparable in tamoxifen control and p27l-/l- retinas. the p27-deficiency did not alter the levels of metabolites and enzymes important for retinal homeostasis and neuronal function.

normal electrophysiology in retinas with reactive p27l-/l- müller glia
several studies suggested that reactive gliosis alters neuronal responsivity well before any indication of neuronal cell death  <cit> . we therefore examined retinal function by electroretinography  during the peak of gfap upregulation and during chronic gfap expression . during these time periods the müller glia nuclei migrated from their normal position  toward the photoreceptor layer . ergs of tamoxifen control mice were essentially identical to those of adult wild-type mice. the p27l-/l- a- and b-waves, reflecting the functional integrity of photoreceptor and bipolar cell signaling  <cit> , were also normal under scotopic  and photopic  conditions . the small increase in p27l-/l- b-wave amplitude and time-to-peak  might be caused by decreased net potassium channel conductance in müller glia  <cit> . however, the distribution and immunoreactivity level of the glial potassium channel kir <dig>  appeared normal in the p27l-/l- retina , suggesting the possibility of increased impedence in müller glia. unlike the p27-/- retina  <cit> , p27l-/l- retina did not exhibit pathologies characteristic of retinal dysfunctions such as reduced, delayed, truncated, or inverted erg signals  <cit> .

normal visual acuity and function in mice with reactive p27l-/l- müller glia
we next tested photopic visual acuity using the optomotor response that evaluates the impact not only of müller glial reactivity but also of reactive glia along the accessory optic system , such as oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve, which normally express p <dig> . spatial frequency thresholds that elicited an optomotor response were not statistically different between tamoxifen control and experimental animals during the peaks of müller glial proliferation and gfap upregulation, or during chronic gfap expression . the spatial frequency threshold of the optomotor response in tamoxifen control and experimental animals  was comparable to previously published values in mice  <cit> .

discussion
p <dig> is a negative regulator of proliferative müller glial reactivity
the hypothesis that p <dig> is a key modulator of glial plasticity is supported by our finding that inducing p27-deficiency is sufficient to promote proliferative müller reactive gliosis in adult retina  <cit> . as a cell cycle inhibitor, p <dig> modulates glial proliferation and consequently p <dig> can modulate the potential of glial cells to regenerate neural tissue and to form scars  <cit> . in mammalian retinal degenerations, müller glia may fail to re-enter the mitotic cycle because of persistent p <dig> expression  <cit> . in contrast, müller glia and astrocytes adjacent to traumatic injuries downregulate p <dig> resulting in glial proliferation that contributes to scar formation  <cit> . the absence of neurogenesis and scar formation after our conditional p <dig> inactivation suggests that while decreased p <dig> activity modulates glial proliferation, transitioning to a neurogenic state or scar forming phenotype must be determined by additional signaling mechanisms. indeed several groups found that addition of neurogenic factors are required to guide proliferating glia into a neurogenic state  <cit> . our conditional p <dig> inactivation also yielded nonproliferative phenotypes including müller glial nuclear migration, cytoplasmic process extension, and increased intermediate filament content. these phenotypes are consistent with data suggesting that the impact of p <dig> activity extends beyond cell cycle regulation, possibly by modulating transcription, cell fate, cell migration, or cytoskeletal dynamics  <cit> . the issue of whether the nonproliferative changes are the direct result of p <dig> deficiency or a secondary response to cell cycle reentry will be addressed in future studies; however, it is clear that p <dig> levels have broad effects on the outcome of glial reactivity even in the absence of degenerative cues. consequently the p <dig> pathway represents a prime target to facilitate glial-based regeneration and to modulate glial scar formation.

reactive gliosis displays context-dependent, graded and dynamic phenotypes
our genetic model of proliferative reactive gliosis is one of several studies using gene targeting approaches to define the role of specific pathways in reactive gliosis . the general theme from genetic dissection studies is that reactive gliosis is a multifaceted event whose diverse molecular, morphological and functional changes are modulated by distinct signaling mechanisms. conditional inactivation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  decreases reactive astrocyte migration after traumatic spinal cord injury  <cit> . conditional inactivation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  enhances reactive astrocyte migration  <cit> . in contrast our inducible inactivation of p <dig> resulted in müller glial cell cycle entry and nuclear migration followed by intermediate filament upregulation , but did not result in additional reactive gliosis components including hypertrophy, scar formation, edema, and loss of homeostatic and metabolic enzymes . diversity in the glial response to stress is widely documented by transcriptome-wide studies. while there is a subset of gene expression changes shared across models and cns tissues , there are context dependent expression changes suggesting diversity and complexity in the gliotic response  <cit> . gene expression data also suggest that the process of reactivity is dynamic with temporal changes clustering into at least three categories: immediate, delayed and chronic  <cit> . thus, gene targeting and expression studies argue that reactive gliosis is context-dependent, graded and dynamic. as genetic targeting studies continue to dissect individual components of reactive gliosis, a better understanding of the functional significance of each component and its role in specific conditions will emerge.

transient gfap expression in müller glia is compatible with neuronal metabolism and function
upregulation of the intermediate filament gfap is arguably the most extensively described hallmark of reactive glia, yet it remains unclear whether this property is beneficial or detrimental to neuronal function and survival. the negative view regarding gfap elevation stems from the correlation between decreased metabolic support and neuronal dysfunction with increased gfap expression in the retina and brain  <cit> . for example, retinal detachment upregulates gfap expression and concomitantly results in loss of glul expression and extensive derangement of glial and neuronal metabolite profiles  <cit> . genetic targeting of intermediate filament expression levels   <cit>  and our inducible model of reactive gliosis reveal a complex role for intermediate filaments on the physiology and pathology of glial cells. while mice lacking intermediate filaments show no developmental or motor functional deficits, they display compromised blood-brain barrier, enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation, decreased cerebellar long-term depression, white matter pathologies and demyelination  <cit> . in disease models, the absence of intermediate filaments exacerbates traumatic and toxic injury, autoimmune response, stroke, and scrapie prion infection by reducing glial hypertrophy and scarring, and compromising the ability of glial cells to osmoregulate, transport glutamate, and repair the blood-brain barrier  <cit> . positive outcomes of reducing glial hypertrophy and scarring in mice lacking intermediate filaments include enhanced adult neurogenesis, axon regeneration, and neural graft survival and integration  <cit> . however, the extent to which increased regeneration potential improves functional recovery in intermediate filament deficient mice is controversial  <cit> . these findings have raised the question that intermediate filament upregulation plays a beneficial role in the acute stage, but prolonged upregulation interferes with neuronal survival and regeneration  <cit> . supporting this view is the finding that mice transgenic for human gfap accumulate high levels of gfap leading to glial hypertrophy, intracytoplasmic aggregates, stress response, oxidative stress, microglial activation and neuronal dysfunction  <cit> . in contrast, transient gfap upregulation in p27l-/l- müller glia was compatible with glial function , neuronal transmission, and visual function. taken together, data from mice with null, transgenic, and transient gfap expression suggest that intermediate filament upregulation facilates the cytoarchitectural remodeling necessary for glial cells to protect the integrity of the tissue, limit the lesion site and modulate basic neuroprotective function of glial cells; but prolonged and robust intermediate filament expression can lead to glial dysfunction.

proliferative müller reactive gliosis is insufficient to induce glial dysfunction, scar formation or neurogenesis
in mammals, glial cell proliferation localizes to areas of severe tissue damage after trauma, ischemia, infection, autoimmune response, or fast degenerative disease  <cit> . in these cases, proliferative gliosis can contribute to the formation of scars, which are hypothesized to impair neuronal function, block axonal regeneration, and interfere with tissue grafts and integration of transplanted cells  <cit> . the contribution of glial proliferation to scar formation was confirmed when proliferating astrocytes were genetically ablated after traumatic brain and spinal cord injury resulting in decreased scar formation. however, there was also impaired functional recovery that correlated with enhanced spread and persistence of inflammatory cells, failure to repair the blood-brain barrier, enhanced tissue damage, neuronal loss, and demyelination  <cit> . the negative outcomes from ablating proliferative astrocytes argue for the need to define the individual components of reactive gliosis that are detrimental or beneficial to neuronal function and survival. in our study, inducible müller glial proliferation, intermediate filament upregulation and migration did not result in scar formation, glial dysfunction or neuronal deficits. the benign impact of inducible proliferative reactive gliosis in our model might be explained by the relatively low level of proliferation, but a more likely explanation is the absence of other changes associated with reactivity such as hypertrophy, decreased potassium clearance, and loss of homeostatic and metabolic enzymes  <cit> . consequently, the extent to which neuronal cell stress, microglial reactivity, inflammatory response, blood barrier damage, or neuronal cell death contribute to the transition from supportive glia to detrimental glia needs to be determined .

CONCLUSIONS
reactive gliosis is a ubiquitous but poorly understood hallmark of cns and retinal pathologies. despite the extensive characterization and manipulation of reactive gliosis, several questions remain unresolved. what regulates reactive gliosis? is the response binary or graded? is the response detrimental or beneficial to neuronal function and survival? our inducible model of p <dig> inactivation exhibited three indices of glial reactivity--proliferation, intermediate filament upregulation, and migratory-like behavior--and allowed us to evaluate their intrinsic impact on retinal neuron function and survival . our metabolic, electrophysiological, and visual behavior data argue that proliferative reactive gliosis is compatible with neuronal metabolism and function, and that the final detrimental outcome of glial plasticity during degeneration or injury is determined by additional factors . in combination with genetic, pharmacological or disease model approaches, the inducible model of proliferative reactive gliosis based on conditional p <dig> inactivation will be a powerful tool to dissect the factors that induce glial dysfunction or neurogenesis.
