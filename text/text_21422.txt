BACKGROUND
gene duplication has long been recognized to be an important way to provide a substrate on which evolution acts. the classical models that predict the most possible fate of one of the duplicate genes is to degenerate to a pseudogene or get lost from the genome due to vagaries of chromosomal remodeling, locus deletion or point mutation  <cit> . a less frequent fate of the duplicate genes is to gain a new function  when the other copy still maintains its original function. however, recent studies have indicated that the newly duplicated genes are often sub-functionalized from their ancestral functions held by the parental genes  <cit> . the sub-functionalization model  explains that the duplicate genes are maintained in the genome relying on complementary degenerative changes in a pair of duplicate genes, such that the duplicate genes together retain the original functions of their single ancestor  <cit> . during this process, the expression domain shifting is the most common character of duplicate genes. as a consequence, the duplicates acquired sub-functionalization and then were less constrained by selection than the single ancestor, which had to maintain the capacity to fulfill all functions. therefore, selection could act independently on each duplicate and increase the gene function specificity  <cit> .

sequence variation plays an essential role in functional renovation of genes, however, the relationship between dna variation and functional consequence has been enigmatic for the vast majority of genes in plant and animal kingdoms, despite an increasing number of studies have been reported. crop species and their wild relatives with available genome information are becoming fascinating subjects for study of correlation between cryptic genetic variation and functional evolution, because they have undergone rapid diversification under intense artificial selection  <cit> . therefore, investigating crop domestication genes will shed meaningful light on genetic variation that drives cultivation adaptation  <cit> . rice was used by human about  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . it has been indicated that the divergence of indica and  japonica predated rice domestication, suggesting that at least two genetically distinct gene pools of o. rufipogon were cultivated and subsequently domesticated  <cit> . during the long-term cultivation and domestication, tremendous diversity in rice has been selected by human, adapting to various ecosystems and agricultural management, in addition to high yielding characteristics, such as grain number and weight  <cit> .

various evolutionary models have been proposed to interpret the fate of paralogous duplicates, but little is known about the mechanisms of evolutionary change in duplicate genes leading to functional novelty. rice has been recognized as a cereal model for such a study, and recent studies have discovered that some rice genes have undergone adaptive evolution under domestication selection  <cit> . we previously reported that the rice grain-filling gene gif <dig>  encoding a cell wall invertase  was most likely subjected to domestication selection  <cit> . here, we report that gif <dig> and another cwi gene oscin <dig> constitute a pair of duplicate genes with differentiated expression and function. population genetic analysis showed that the two genes have experienced strong domestication selection, and interestingly, the target of selection in the gif <dig> gene is the promoter region and that in oscin <dig> is the coding region.

RESULTS
evolution of gif <dig> and oscin <dig> by gene duplication
rice genome has a cwi family consisting of eight members  <cit> . our previous study has demonstrated that gif <dig> is a member of the gene family and required for assimilated carbon partitioning during early grain-filling  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis of the known plant cwi genes and predicted cwi genes from the recently released maize and sorghum genomes showed that oscin <dig>  located on chromosome  <dig>  is highly similar to gif <dig> located on chromosome  <dig> . genetic distance based on amino acid substitutions also indicated that oscin <dig> is most closely related to gif <dig> . to gain insight into their evolutionary relationship, the 500-kb flanking sequences of the gif <dig> and oscin <dig> regions were compared. the other eight expressed genes flanking the gif <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> show good colinearity to the eight counterparts of the oscin <dig> region on chromosome  <dig> . the result indicated that gif <dig> and oscin <dig> rose via duplication of a genomic block, which could be as large as  <dig> mb . as shown in figure 1a, phylogenetic analysis including cell-wall invertases of zea mays, sorghum bicolor, lolium perenne, hordeum vulgare, dendrocalamopsis oldhamii and oryza sativa showed that gif <dig> was closer to cell-wall invertases of zea mays, hordeum vulgare and dendrocalamopsis oldhamii, suggesting that this duplication might occur during the genome duplication of grasses  <cit> . by directly using synonymous substitution rate between the two paralogs , and assuming the neutral evolutionary rate of rice genes   <cit> , we estimated the time of duplication between gif <dig> and oscin <dig> about  <dig> million years ago , a time much earlier than the genus oryza diversified from a common ancestor about  <dig> mya  <cit> . however, this estimated duplication age could be invalid because the regions were likely selected during rice domestication .

to investigate the evidence for functional constraint on both copies at the dna sequence level, we calculated ka /ks ratios between gif <dig>  oscin <dig> and their homologs in maize, respectively  <cit> . the respective ka/ks value of gif <dig> and oscin <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig>   , suggesting strong purifying selection.

sub-functionalization of gif <dig> and oscin <dig> by expression differentiation
duplicate genes can be maintained by sub-functionalization , or neo-functionalization , and may facilitate adaptation to environmental change  <cit> . our previous research has indicated that other cins, including oscin <dig>  are not functionally redundant to gif <dig>  <cit> . here we further compared the expression patterns of gif <dig> and oscin <dig> in different tissues and grain-filling stages. gif <dig> transcripts were detected in roots, elongating internodes, shoots and panicles, but not in leaves. in contrast, oscin <dig> was expressed strongly in leaves, but weakly in elongating internodes . during the early grain-filling stage, oscin <dig> transcript levels remained high while gif <dig> transcript levels decreased after  <dig> days post-pollination  . in situ hybridization experiments further showed that the gif <dig> transcript was only detected in the ovular vascular tissue but not in the pericarp and endosperm  <cit> ; in contrast, the oscin <dig> transcript was detected in both the pericarp and endosperm  <cit> . consistent with the difference in their expression pattern, gif <dig> was induced in the caryopses supplied with sugars, but oscin <dig> was inducible in the leaves treated with sucrose and pathogen  <cit> . these results evidently showed that gif <dig> and oscin <dig> have differentiated in expression pattern after duplication through altering expression patterns in development and response to environment cues.

sub-functionalization of gif <dig> and oscin <dig> enzymes
total activity of cell-wall invertases was reduced to 17% of the wild-type in the gif <dig> mutant  <cit> , indicating that gif <dig> contributes to the majority of cell-wall invertase activity in early developing grains, although oscin <dig> was also expressed at a higher level in developing grains . in support of this observation, the oscin <dig> t-dna 'knockout' mutant did not show significant defect in grain filling and weight . to further determine the functional differentiation of the gif <dig> and oscin1enzymes, we developed transgenic plants gif1-oe  <cit>  and cin1-oe constitutively expressing gif <dig> and oscin <dig> driven by the 35s promoter . gif1-oe plants exhibited significantly higher cwi activity than that of cin1-oe plants although the latter accumulated higher oscin <dig> levels . these results suggested that gif <dig> and oscin <dig> could have different kinetics parameters such as km and vmax.

the difference in the kinetics parameters of enzymatic activity might result from the amino acid substitutions, in particular the gif <dig> and oscin <dig> proteins contain ala and gly residues in the ndpng domain , respectively . phylogenetic reconstruction  revealed that the gly-26-ala substitution occurred after the gif <dig> and oscin <dig> duplication. the crystal structure of the arabidopsis cwi indicated that the conserved ndpng domain is critical for cwi activity  <cit> . however, gif <dig> and the homologous maize mn <dig> contain a ndpna motif instead of the ndpng motif that presents in oscin <dig> and other cwis, suggesting that the segmental duplication predates maize and rice differentiation. furthermore, the crystal structure showed that asp- <dig> interacted with lys- <dig> and both the two amino acids played a crucial role in the transfructosylation process and interacted via h-bonds with the bound substrate  <cit> . a thr-241-arg substitution in the asp-239/lys- <dig> region occurred in gif <dig> as well as in mn <dig>  it is noteworthy that the mutation in the mn <dig> gene also caused shrunk grains  <cit> . the synteny between the gif <dig> and mn <dig> genome regions suggested that they could be orthologues . these structure differences might contribute to different enzymatic kinetics of the gif <dig> and oscin <dig> proteins. together, these results suggested that gif <dig> and oscin <dig> were subjected to sub-functionalization, or that gif <dig>  might have neofunctionalized, albeit we do not know the ancestral function of the cwis.

different phenotypes of gif1-oe and cin1-oe plants support sub-functionalization of gif <dig> and oscin1
to further confirm functional divergence of gif <dig> and oscin <dig>  we determined the phenotypes of gif1-oe and cin1-oe plants. in addition to producing shrunken grains , gif1-oe plants were also dwarfed in comparison with wild-type plants . by contrast, cin1-oe plants did not exhibit any obvious phenotype in grain-filling and plant development . instead, the cin1-oe seeds exhibited marked preharvest sprouting in  <dig> of  <dig> transgenic lines tested, which expressed high oscin <dig> levels , a phenomenon never occurring to the wild-type japonica control. these observations suggest that oscin <dig> might indirectly modulating hormone signaling pathways through interfering sugar metabolism in seed germination, leading to preharvest sprouting, since the sugar regulates rice alpha amylase . together, our results demonstrate that gif <dig> and oscin <dig> have evolved differentially or most likely sub-functionalized after duplication.

evidence of oscin <dig> domestication-selection
in the previous study, we analyzed artificial selection using the segment sequences of gif <dig>  here we further analyzed the 2-kb promoter region of gif <dig> in  <dig> cultivars and  <dig> wild rice germplasm  . we identified nine types of promoter sequences . according to the promoter sequences, nearly all cultivated rice was classified into type  <dig>  further supporting that the gif <dig> promoter was artificially selected during rice domestication.

we further sequenced two bacs containing respective oscin <dig> and gif <dig> of the bb-genome of wild rice , and found that the coding region of oscin <dig> contains more variation than the coding region of gif <dig> in comparison with the reference aa genome sequences   <cit> , probably suggesting that oscin <dig> and gif <dig> might have experienced different selection during oryza evolution. to carefully investigate the evolution pattern of the oscin <dig> gene, we sequenced the oscin <dig> genome regions of the same set of  <dig> cultivars and  <dig> wild rice germplasm . results showed that the silent-site nucleotide, θπ, of oscin <dig> in japonica and indica were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, lower than θπ  in wild rice; and also much lower than the genome average θπ  in japonica and indica, respectively . furthermore, the hudson-kreitman-aguade  test detected a highly significant deviation of oscin <dig> from neutrality for cultivated rice compared with the adh <dig> gene   <cit> , using o. punctata as an outgroup . the negative deviation in tajima's d was also consistent with a selective sweep at the oscin <dig> locus in both japonica and indica, but no such a pattern was observed in wild rice . these results suggest the oscin <dig> gene might also have been artificially selected. we also estimated genetic variation in upstream and downstream regions of oscin <dig> in the cultivars and wild rice genomes, and found that the region under selective sweep may extend as long as ~100-kb. we further constructed a gene tree using  <dig> -kb gene regions of oscin <dig> from the cultivars and wild rice . consequently, all the japonica and indica accessions formed a cluster in the gene tree, in considerable contrast to a genome tree  established based on snp data  <cit> , suggesting oscin <dig> introgression from one subspecies into another subspecies after domestication-selection, although our data could not rule out the possibility that oscin <dig> was extensively selected during rice domestication independently in the two subspecies. all the results strongly support the hypothesis that oscin <dig> was selected during rice domestication. however, how the oscin <dig> gene has played a role in domestication is still unknown.

athe up-/downstream 2-kb genome regions of oscin <dig> and gif <dig> were analyzed for hka.

to narrow down the selection target in the oscin <dig> gene, we examined all the variations in the oscin <dig> genome regions, and found that an amino acid substitution  almost fixed in the rice cultivars, indicating that, unlike gif <dig> which was selected in the promoter region, this site in the coding region could be the target of artificial selection in the oscin <dig> gene . further functional characterization of this site will provide more evidence to address how this site has contributed to oscin <dig> function in cultivated rice.

discussion
gene duplication and adaptive conflict
gene duplication plays a fundamental role in organism evolution by providing genetic materials from which novel functions can arise. large numbers of duplicate genes were found in genomes, which contributed greatly to the genome structure and function evolution  <cit> . in general, the duplicate genes have two fates: first, the duplicate gene lost its function due to chromosome remodeling, deletion, and point mutation ; second, the duplicate gene retained for the maintenance of ancestral functions  <cit> . according to adaptive conflict model, adaptive mutations could be prohibited in the case of multifunctional genes, or one mutation that can optimize one function, may compromise the other functions, this mutation will be prohibited  <cit> . the adaptive conflict could be solved by sub-functionalization of duplicate genes. in this case, the duplicate genes would be less constrained and be able to evolve new functions under selection  <cit> . with this scenario, it is common that one gene could have multifunction in nature  <cit> .

independent selection of gif <dig> and oscin <dig> mutations
the sequenced genomes of oryza sativa, arabidopsis thaliana and populus trichocarpa all contain a family of cell wall invertases  <cit> , some members of these gene families were reported to be involved in growth and development, disease resistance, stress responses and cell death, suggesting that the cwi gene families might have undergone sub- or neo-functionalized in these species.

through genomic synteny analysis, we showed that gif <dig> and oscin <dig> derived from a segmental duplication from an ancestor, most likely during genome duplication in grass species. after duplication, gif <dig> and oscin <dig> have evolved to gain divergent functions with different expression patterns and enzymatic kinetics parameters through accumulating mutations in cultivated rice. in contrast to gif <dig> on which domestication selection mainly occurred in the cis-regulatory region , the artificial selection occurred mainly in the coding region of oscin <dig> . therefore, both gif <dig> and oscin <dig> were most likely subjected to domestication selection, resulting in a cultivated gif <dig> locus for better harvest, although the biological importance of oscin <dig> in domestication remains enigmatic. with this scenario, gif <dig> and oscin <dig> may provide a good genetic model to demonstrate how duplicate genes could evolve and be artificially selected independently during crop domestication with divergent functions derived from accumulation of mutations in the regulatory and coding regions respectively, adding to those systems reported  <cit> .

differential biological functions of gif <dig> and oscin1
gif <dig> is mainly expressed in seed vascular tissues and controls sucrose unloading for starch synthesis at the early grain-filling stage  <cit> . overexpression of the gif <dig> gene produced plants with marked defects both in grain-filling and development, indicating that over-activity of the gif <dig> enzyme disrupts sugar homeostasis, a process important to normal grain and plant development. in contrast, oscin <dig> has lower cwi activity compared to gif <dig> in the transgenic plants . consistent with this, no obvious phenotype was observed in cin1-oe plants except pre-harvest sprouting . interestingly, oscin <dig> might be involved in pathogen defense and stress response  <cit> . it has been reported that sugars interact with signaling pathways mediated by phytohormones such as ga and aba during seed germination and seedling development  <cit> , which are also involved in stress responses. preharvest sprouting of the cin1-oe seeds may implicate a role for oscin <dig> in sugar-mediated alpha amylases activation  <cit> . however, detailed experiments are needed to dissect the oscin <dig> function.

CONCLUSIONS
gene duplication and functional divergence contribute greatly to genetic novelty and adaptive evolution. however, molecular basis of selection and functionalization of duplicate genes remains largely unknown. based on a set of data including population genetic analysis, fine sequencing of wild rice bacs, phenotyping of transgenic plants and analysis of gene expression and enzymatic activity, we provide a line of evidence that the two rice cwi genes gif <dig> and oscin <dig> are a pair of duplicate genes and have been subjected to sub-functionalization during evolution or domestication selection. therefore, duplicate genes could be independently selected towards different functional specificity, either on promoter for different expression pattern or on coding region for different protein function/activity. our study provides a vivid example for evolution of genetic novelties in a model crop. the interesting phenotype of preharvest sprouting oscin1-oe plants suggests that oscin <dig> overaccumulation might disturb sugar balance during seed germination.
