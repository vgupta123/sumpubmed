BACKGROUND
one of the most daunting challenges in the post-genomic era is to identify all transcribed regions in a sequenced genome. although computational programs have played an important role in genome annotation, highly accurate prediction of the coding regions of many genes is still challenging  <cit> . therefore, the experimental approaches such as ests   <cit> , full-length cdna sequencing  <cit> , sage   <cit> , mpss   <cit> , rate  in the sequenced genomes.

although est and full-length cdna sequencing are effective approaches for gene discovery and expression profiling, neither is cost-effective nor comprehensive enough to isolate the majority of rare transcripts. since the fabrication of most types of microarrays relies on sequences that are derived from ests, full-length cdnas or computer program-predicted coding regions, many rare transcripts may be absent from these arrays. sage and mpss are two powerful methods for genome-wide expression profiling and novel gene identification  <cit> . both methods determine the sequence of short tags derived from a defined position at the 3' regions of expressed mrnas in a cell. sage uses traditional sequencing technologies, while mpss uses a novel bead-based hybridization procedure  <cit> . the main advantage of mpss over sage is that over one million signatures can be obtained from a library in comparison to  <dig>  to  <dig>  tags in a sage library. however, sage method is technically simple and can be performed in most molecular laboratories, whereas mpss involves many complex cloning steps and library construction and sequencing is only performed at solexa, inc. the newly developed 5'-rate method simplifies tag cloning and sequencing procedures and should have a broad application for transcriptome analysis of complex genomes  <cit> .

magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, causes severe yield losses to cereals, including the economically important crops, such as rice, barley, wheat, and millets  <cit> . this fungus completes its life cycle by conidia landing on the leaf surface, conidia germination, appressorium formation, penetration, establishment and new conidia formation within seven to ten days after infection  <cit> . in addition to its economic importance, the recent release of the complete genome draft sequence  <cit>  and characterization of several important avirulence/pathogenecity-related genes  <cit> , makes m. grisea a model plant pathogen for studying host-pathogen interactions. although  <dig>  genes  are predicted in the genome of m. grisea, many of these genes have no experimental support. identification and characterization of all expressed genes from the infectious  and non-infectious  structures are indispensable for understanding the mechanism of fungal pathogenesis and designing novel strategies to combat the disease.

the main objective of this study was to identify all expressed transcripts encoded in the m. grisea genome using mpss, rl-sage and oligoarrays, and to compare the qualitative and quantitative measurements produced by these three methods. using these three technologies, the m. grisea transcriptome in the vegetative mycelial stage and in the infectious appressorial stage was analyzed in depth, in which many novel sense and antisense transcripts and alternative splicing variants were discovered. we also compared the correlation coefficients of the gene expression patterns revealed by mpss, rl-sage and oligoarray. our results provide the most comprehensive analysis of the sense, antisense and alternative transcripts of a fungal genome published to date and represent a useful genomic resource for further detailed functional analysis of the expressed transcripts involved in m. grisea growth and pathogenesis.

RESULTS
characterization of mycelium and appressorium transcriptomes of m. grisea by mpss and rl-sage methods
using mpss, a total of  <dig> , <dig> transcript tags from mycelia and  <dig> , <dig> transcript tags from appressoria were obtained. as per meyers et al.  <cit> , we filtered the total mpss tags into two groups: significant  and non-significant  tags. after performing a clustering analysis with the total tags,  <dig>   and  <dig>  significant tags and  <dig>   and  <dig>   non-significant tags were identified from mycelial and appressorial tissues, respectively . clustering analysis of the significant tags from both mycelium and appressorium mpss libraries resulted in  <dig>  distinct tags corresponding to  <dig>  annotated genes. using both significant and non-significant tags, a total of  <dig>  unique genes were identified. approximately,  <dig> %  of the appressorial significant tags and  <dig> %  of the mycelial significant tags were specific to each stage. when the tags matched to the annotated genes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes specific to appressorium and mycelium tissues, respectively, were identified . these results show that the transcriptomes of appressorium and mycelium tissues are quite different.

an rl-sage library was constructed using the same rna sample that was used for the construction of the mycelium mpss library . the average insert size of the rl-sage clones was approximately  <dig>  kb. a total of  <dig>  individual tags and  <dig>  distinct tags were obtained from  <dig>  sequence reads. out of the total distinct tags,  <dig>   were significant  and  <dig>   were non-significant  transcript tags.

matching analysis of the mpss and rl-sage tags to m. grisea genomic and expressed sequences
we compared the mpss and rl-sage data to both genomic and expressed sequences of m. grisea to identify the genes from which these tags were obtained. the whole genome sequence from the broad institute  and the ests from tigr  and the cogeme database  <cit> ) were used to match mpss and rl-sage tags. the matching results are summarized below.

1) mpss tags
the matching rate of the significant tags to the genomic sequence from both libraries was about 85% . in contrast, the matching rate to m. grisea ests for the significant tags from the mycelial  and appressorial  libraries was much lower than that to the genomic sequence. similarly,  <dig> to 50% of the significant tags matched to the predicted coding sequences   <cit> . these results suggest that a large proportion of significant mpss tags  were not present in the public est collections and could be considered as novel transcripts. given that 5–10% of the ests may have no matches in the genome sequence, we conservatively estimate that at least 40% of the significant mpss tags represent previously unidentified transcripts. we also observed that ~  <dig> to 32% of the significant mpss tags from both the libraries matched to regions within  <dig> bp downstream of the 3' region of annotated genes and about 7% of the significant tags from both the libraries matched to regions within  <dig> bp upstream of the 5' region of annotated genes. about  <dig> to 15% of the significant tags located in the intergenic regions matched to the genomic sequence but not to the cds,  <dig> bp downstream or  <dig> bp upstream sequences . combining the cds,  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream of cds, we identified  <dig>  genes in appressoria and  <dig>  genes in mycelia by mpss. a total of  <dig>  genes were commonly expressed in both appressoria and mycelia. while  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were specifically expressed at the appressorial and mycelial stages, respectively.

2) rl-sage tags
in comparison with the mpss libraries, more significant tags were identified in the mycelial rl-sage library. about 65% of significant rl-sage tags matched the m. grisea genomic sequences . unlike the mpss tags, only 31%  of the significant tags from the rl-sage library matched to the m. grisea est sequences  and a small portion  of the tags matched to the cds of the annotated genes . we also observed that about 31% of the mycelial rl-sage significant tags matched to the  <dig> bp downstream of the 3' region of the annotated genes and about 6% of the significant tags matched within  <dig> bp upstream of the 5' region of the annotated genes . the reason for the high percentage of the rl-sage tags located within the  <dig> bp downstream region might be due to more nlaiii sites  than dpnii sites  in the 3' utr region. combining the tags hit to cds,  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream regions, we identified  <dig>  genes in mycelia by the rl-sage method.

3) identification of novel transcript tags in the mpss and rl-sage libraries
a detailed analysis of the novel transcripts that did not match to any sequences in the ests and annotated genes was performed . the percentage of the novel tags in the appressorium mpss, mycelium mpss, and mycelium rl-sage libraries was about 35%, 26%, and 35%, respectively . a total of  <dig>  genes in the rl-sage library identified by cds and their  <dig> bp upstream and down stream regions did not match the ests either in tigr or cogeme database. similarly,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes identified in the mpss appressorial and mycelial library, respectively, also did not show any matches in tigr or cogeme m. grisea ests. in the two mpss libraries, about 67% and 76% of the non-significant appressorial and mycelial tags matched to the genome sequence, respectively . even among the tags that did not match the genome sequence, many of them were significant tags, which might be derived from the un-sequenced or intron-exon junctions in the genome. some of them may be true transcripts encoded in the genome but could not be matched due to sequencing errors in the genome or in the est, mpss or rl-sage tag sequencing. to validate the mpss and rl-sage results, two genes  without any est matches in the public databases were amplified and cloned , demonstrating that the majority of the identified novel tags might be true transcripts.

antisense transcripts for the annotated genes of m. grisea
1) antisense transcript tags from the mpss libraries
numerous antisense tags were identified in this study that matched m. grisea annotated genes in an antisense orientation. a total of  <dig>  significant antisense tags  corresponding to  <dig>  genes from the mycelial library and  <dig>  significant antisense tags  corresponding to  <dig>  genes from the appressorial library were identified. of which,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were mycelium and appressorium-specific, respectively. among them,  <dig>  antisense genes were commonly expressed in both appressoria and mycelia. total antisense tags from significant and non-significant tags are shown in figure  <dig>  only fewer significant antisense tags  were identified in the appressorium library as compared to the mycelial library . interestingly, we observed antisense transcripts for some of the well-known genes that are involved in appressorium formation and pathogenesis such as hydrophobin , and calmodulin . when the tags only matching the antisense sequences and having a single hit to the annotated genes were chosen,  <dig> genes in appressoria and  <dig> genes in mycelia were identified as antisense transcripts. the antisense tags and their frequency are listed in additional file  <dig> 

2) antisense transcript tags from the rl-sage library
although the total number of significant antisense transcript tags  corresponding to  <dig>  genes identified from the mycelial rl-sage library was similar to that of the mycelial mpss library, the tag distribution in the three regions of the annotated genes was different . the proportion of the rl-sage antisense tags located in the  <dig> bp downstream regions was twice  that of the mpss library  at the mycelial stage. similar with the sense tags, this difference might be due to the use of different anchoring enzymes in mpss  and rl-sage  library construction. among the identified antisense tags,  <dig> were present in both rl-sage and mpss libraries,  <dig>  were specific to the mpss libraries, and  <dig> were specific to the rl-sage library. the antisense tags and their frequency are listed in additional file  <dig> 

3) annotated cds regions with sense and antisense mpss tags
nearly 19% of the annotated genes in the m. grisea genome had sense and antisense tags matching to both strands of the annotated genes. among these genes,  <dig>   were from the mycelium mpss library and  <dig>  were from the appressorium mpss library. there were  <dig>  genes with sense and antisense pairs specifically present in the mycelium library and  <dig> genes with sense and antisense pairs specifically present in the appressorium library. four hundred and forty eight genes  were present in the two libraries . to support that the mpss sense and antisense tags are reliable, we found that six annotated genes have both sense and antisense transcripts from the rl-sage library and public est collections .

4) annotated cds regions with sense and antisense rl-sage tags
we identified that nearly 10% of the annotated genes in the m. grisea genome had bothsense and antisense tags from the mycelial rl-sage library. the significant lower number of tag pairs at the protein coding region in the rl-sage library is likely because that the majority of the rl-sage tags were located in the  <dig> bp downstream region of the annotated genes . some of the sense and antisense rl-sage tag pairs are also present in the mpss libraries and public est collections .

identification of alternative transcript tags in mycelia and appressoria
since mpss and rl-sage tags are derived from the 3' end of each transcript, the presence of more than one tag in the cds of a gene suggests an alternative termination of the gene. these termination differences could be derived from either alternative polyadenylation or alternative splicing at the 3' end. all the transcripts from both cases are called alternative transcripts in this study. to determine the extent of transcriptional diversity in m. grisea, we assessed the proportion of the genes with alternative terminations in both libraries.

1) alternative sense and antisense mpss tags in mycelia and appressoria
when the sense tags were matched to the annotated genes, ~ 20–35% of the genes were found to have at least two alternative transcripts . in general, more genes expressed in mycelia had more alternative transcript tags in comparison to that in appressoria. the hypothetical protein similar to linoleate diol synthase precursor  in the mycelium mpss library matched to  <dig> alternative tags and another hypothetical gene  in the appressorium library had  <dig> alternative tags . a total of  <dig>  mycelial and  <dig>  appressorial genes were found to encode alternative transcripts. among them,  <dig> genes were common between the two tissues,  <dig>  were mycelia-specific and  <dig> were appressoria-specific. further, we used m. grisea tigr est database from which alternative splice forms from m. grisea were clustered. the genes undergoing alternative termination or splicing have more than one mpss tags. a total of  <dig> appressorial and  <dig> mycelial unique clusters have two or more mpss tags .

similarly, many annotated genes had more than one antisense tags in the mpss libraries . twenty percent of the annotated genes in appressoria and 32% in mycelia had more than one antisense tag. as with the sense transcript tags in mycelia, the same gene  had thirteen alternative antisense tags .

2) alternative sense and antisense rl-sage tags in mycelia
about one-fourth  of the annotated genes in mycelia were found to produce at least two alternative sense tags in the rl-sage library, which is less than that observed in the mpss mycelial library . in the rl-sage mycelial library, a hypothetical protein similar to reverse transcriptase  was found to encode sixteen alternative transcript tags . many genes with known functions were found to encode alternative transcript tags . a total of  <dig>  alternative tags were commonly present in both rl-sage and mpss .

among the antisense rl-sage tags in the mycelium library, nearly a quarter  had at least two alternative antisense transcript tags per gene . a hypothetical gene  was found to generate seven alternative antisense transcript tags . several genes with multiple sense and antisense alternative tags were also identified. for example, four sense and one antisense tags were obtained for the hsp <dig> gene .

characterization of the appressorium and mycelium transcriptomes by oligoarray hybridizations
to compare the transcriptional profiles generated from mpss and rl-sage with that from oligoarray analysis, the same rna samples used in mpss and rl-sage library construction were hybridized to the m. grisea/o. sativa oligoarray  <cit> . using a stringent cut off at false discovery rate  =  <dig>  that corresponds to a p-value of  <dig> ,  <dig>  genes  were identified to be statistically significant expressed in mycelium and appressorium tissues. among them,  <dig>  probes are from m. grisea genes and  <dig> probes from rice genes. the hybridizations with the rice genes were likely due to sequence similarity between housekeeping genes in both organisms. of the  <dig>  m. grisea genes,  <dig>   and  <dig>   were differentially  up-regulated in appressoria, and down-regulated in mycelia, respectively. we identified  <dig> m. grisea genes that were ≥  <dig>  fold significantly up-regulated in appressoria, and  <dig> genes that were ≤  <dig>  fold significantly down-regulated in mycelia. the top  <dig> highly and specifically up- and down-regulated genes in appressoria and mycelia are shown in .

to gain more insight on the molecular mechanisms involved in m. grisea pathogenesis, we tried to functionally categorize  <dig>  significant expressed genes, that were induced or repressed in the appressorium  and also in the mycelium , respectively, into different functional classes using kogs analysis based on putative function of proteins  <cit> . functional classification and percentage of genes represented in appressorial and mycelial tissues are shown in the additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the results indicate that a significant proportion of the genes  were unclassified. the relative categories of genes expressed at the mycelial and appressorial stages are shown in figure  <dig>  the abundance of the gene category of cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning, cytoskeleton, lipid transport, and metabolism was significantly high in appressoria as compared to mycelia . on the contrary, the abundance of the genes involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, rna processing and modification, nuclear structure, coenzyme transport and metabolism, was significantly expressed in the mycelia when compared to appressoria.

qualitative analysis of the m. grisea transcriptome using mpss, rl-sage, and oligoarray platforms
to compare the expression pattern of the transcripts identified from the three different methods, a comparative analysis was performed. because of the differences in the three platforms, a direct comparison of gene expression was not feasible. therefore, an indirect comparison was made in which the oligoarray sequences  were used as the common targets to match the mycelial mpss and rl-sage tags. the appressorium tags were not included in the analysis since no appressorial rl-sage library was made. using the mycelial rl-sage  and mpss  tags,  <dig>  mpss and  <dig>  rl-sage tags matched the gene sequences on the microarray . when the expression profiles of the mycelial and appressorial tissues were compared,  <dig>  genes were significantly expressed in the mycelial tissue. clustering analysis of the genes from the three groups resulted in the identification of  <dig>  genes. a total of  <dig>  genes were commonly expressed in all three platforms . oligoarray and rl-sage shared  <dig> %, oligoarray and mpss shared  <dig> % and mpss and rl-sage shared about  <dig> % of the  <dig>  genes. oligoarray and mpss together identified  <dig> %, oligoarray and rl-sage together identified  <dig> % and rl-sage and mpss together identified  <dig> % of the  <dig>  unique genes. these results demonstrated that each method could identify specific groups of expressed genes and a combination of either of the two methods can identify the majority of the transcripts.

quantitative analysis of the mycelium and appressorium transcriptomes using mpss, rl-sage, and oligoarray platforms
to quantitatively assess the transcripts identified in the three different platforms, a pearson correlation coefficient analysis was performed. in a comparative analysis between mpss or rl-sage mycelial tags and the oligoarray mycelial mean signal intensity, a poor correlation was observed when unfiltered data was used . in the mpss and oligoarray data comparison, regression analysis was performed after removing the ten genes that were within the regression standard residual cutoff of = - <dig>  to =  <dig> . the removal of this small number of outliers had increased the correlation co-efficiency from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . similarly, after removal of fourteen outlying genes , the correlation coefficiency between rl-sage tag frequency and the oligoarray mean signal intensity was improved significantly . for example, the correlation coefficiency was increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when rl-sage tags with copy number =  <dig> were used. in general, the correlation coefficiency was higher in the comparisons for the genes with high copy numbers.

conversely, a moderate correlation coefficiency  was obtained between mpss and the oligoarray appressorial data without data filtering . after the removal of the four outlying genes, the correlation coefficiency was increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the mpss tags with copy number =  <dig> . in mycelia, the correlation was only about  <dig>  for the genes with  <dig> or more copies, even after the removal of ten outlying genes. comparing mycelial mpss and rl-sage tags data, a low correlation was observed without data filtering. after the removal of the  <dig> outliers from the dataset, the correlation coefficiency was increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  between mycelial mpss and rl-sage tags .

in summary, we found a low to moderate correlation among the expression data from the three platforms, especially those data between mpss and oligoarray. in general, a better expression correlation was observed for high copy number tags in the mpss and rl-sage libraries with their corresponding genes on the oligoarray.

discussion
recent technological innovations have advanced genomics in an unprecedented way. several complex genomes have been sequenced in recent years providing an excellent starting point to fully understand the genetic blueprint of an organism. however, identification of all the expressed portions of a sequenced genome is a challenging task, yet critical to the understanding of gene regulation and metabolic networks. the public availability of the whole genome sequence of m. grisea has established a solid foundation to further understand the pathogenicity mechanism of this notorious fungal plant pathogen which causes severe yield losses in rice growing countries  <cit> . elucidating the transcriptome of m. grisea may ultimately lead to the development of novel approaches for combating rice blast disease. in the last few years, many researchers have adopted various gene expression profiling techniques to characterize the m. grisea transcriptome under various conditions or in different cell types including est sequencing  <cit> , microarrays  <cit> , and sage  <cit> . however, these methods have only provided partial information about the m. grisea transcriptome due to technical limitations and the depth of the surveys performed in these studies. in this study, we employed three global and quantitative expression tools, namely mpss, rl-sage and oligoarrays, to profile the m. grisea transcriptome at two developmental stages. in these experiments, the same rna samples isolated from mycelia and appressoria were used so that the results from three different platforms could be readily compared. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  significant tags in mycelia have been identified by mpss and rl-sage, respectively. in appressoria,  <dig>  significant mpss tags were identified. many identified transcripts were not present in the existing est or cdna collections of m. grisea and many of them matched unannotated regions of the genome.

both rl-sage and mpss are tag-based approaches for transcriptome analysis and genome annotation. they are different from the conventional approach that focuses on the large clone collections following the principle of collecting a "representative clone" for each gene. although conventional approaches are useful to catalog the expressed genes in certain tissues, especially moderately or highly expressed genes, many weakly expressed genes might have been missed in these collections. more importantly, it is not possible for the conventional approaches to address the questions regarding the dynamics of transcriptional regulation and regulatory principles like alternative promoter usage and splicing  <cit> . in contrast, rl-sage and mpss methods isolate and sequence short tags  from the 3' regions of most transcripts. at least  <dig>  rl-sage tags or a million mpss tags can be easily obtained from these libraries.

in this study, we obtained approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  million tags from the mycelial and appressorial mpss libraries, respectively. the matching rate of the significant tags from each library to the m. grisea draft genome sequence was about 85%, suggesting that the mpss data have a very deep coverage of the transcriptome. in contrast, only about  <dig> to 60% of the significant tags matched to the existing est collections in the public databases. a similar result was also obtained from the rl-sage library, suggesting that current m. grisea est collections are incomplete. one possible explanation is that most m. grisea ests were sequenced from the 5' region of the transcripts  <cit> , whereas most of the mpss and rl-sage tags were derived from the 3' region of expressed genes. due to sequencing cost limitations, we only sequenced only  <dig>  clones and obtained a quarter million tags from the mycelium rl-sage library. the transcripts recovered from the mpss and rl-sage methods were overlapping but not identical due to the use of different anchoring enzymes in the library construction. interestingly, we found that the genome matching rate of rl-sage tags is lower than that of the mpss tags. these are two possible reasons. first, sequencing errors might generate unmatched tags, especially for singleton tags. second, the significant mpss tags used for matching have =  <dig> copies whereas the significant rl-sage tags have =  <dig> copies, suggesting the mpss tags selected for matching may be more reliable. the last reason is that most of the rl-sage tags matched putative 3' utr region, which may frequently targeted for rna variation as reported in mammalian system  <cit> . nevertheless, our results demonstrated that mpss and rl-sage methods are powerful techniques for deep transcriptome analysis and novel gene discovery. the two methods are complementary and different types of transcripts could be identified from each of these methods.

one of the advantages of tag-based techniques is the detection of alternatively terminated transcripts in the rna population. from both mpss and rl-sage libraries, we found many annotated genes have alternative transcript tags. some of them have corresponding est transcripts. the percentage of genes with evidence of alternative termination ranged from 27% in the rl-sage mycelium library to 35% in the mpss mycelium library. the higher rate of alternative transcript tags in the mpss library may be due to the fact that more mpss tags  matched to the coding regions of the annotated genes than that of the rl-sage tags . it has been previously shown that a high rate of alternative transcripts was found in the protein coding regions , and a low rate  of alternative transcripts was found in the 3' utr  <cit> . the reason for the lower rate of alternative transcripts in appressoria than in mycelia is not clear. in addition, cloning and sequencing confirmation of some alternative transcripts without ets support is required. regulation of the alternative transcripts and functions of these sense and antisense alternative transcripts in m. grisea warrant more detailed analyses.

naturally occurring antisense transcripts were first observed in prokaryotes and viruses and later found in eukaryotes. there is evidence for the involvement of antisense transcripts in alternative transcription  <cit> , rna editing  <cit> , dna methylation  <cit> , genomic imprinting  <cit> , and x-chromosome inactivation  <cit> . in this study, many antisense tags were identified in mycelium or appressorium libraries, corresponding to more than 25% of the annotated genes. it is not clear at this point that why m. grisea genome encode so many antisense transcripts. like the sense tags, almost two-thirds of antisense transcripts detected in the rl-sage library were located in the  <dig> bp downstream regions, whereas the majority of antisense tags from the mpss library were located within the protein coding regions. surprisingly, we found that almost one-fifth of the annotated genes encode both sense and antisense transcripts. in these genes, antisense transcripts could form double stranded rna  with their sense transcripts. if a dsrna is formed, it could be degraded to form small interfering rnas that could decrease sense rna abundance  <cit> . alternatively, interference by rna polymerase ii transcription activity on the antisense strand could restrict sense-strand transcription  <cit> .

recently, few studies demonstrated the function of antisense transcripts in fungal growth and development. for example, the circadian clock gene in the fungus neurospora, a close relative of m. grisea, is regulated by the presence of natural antisense transcripts  <cit> . casas-flores et al  <cit>  expressed an antisense version of the pkr- <dig> gene of trichoderma atroviride, encoding the regulatory subunit of protein kinase a , resulted in a non-sporulating phenotype.

through data mining for est, mpss and rl-sage antisense tags, we have identified longer antisense transcripts in m. grisea for transcription factors mst <dig>  and dead box-containing protein , ribosomal protein, s <dig> , ribosomal protein, l <dig>  and atp synthase alpha chain . mst <dig>  is essential for host penetration and invasive growth, but was not required for appressorium formation  <cit> . mst <dig> is regulated by map kinase at the downstream of signal transduction cascade during pathogenesis  <cit> . it will be interesting to know if the mst12-mediated signal transduction cascade is regulated by antisense mechanism or not. a detailed characterization of mst <dig> antisense transcript may reveal its novel role in pathogenesis.

mpss, sage, and oligoarrays are three widely used methods for transcriptome profiling. we performed qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of the mycelial and appressorial transcriptomes revealed by the three methods. more than 40% of the annotated genes were detected by both mpss and rl-sage methods. there was a good correlation in gene expression levels between the appressorium mpss expression data and appressorium oligoarray data  and a moderate correlation between the mycelium mpss and the mycelium oligoarray data  after removing several outlying genes in the datasets. however, the correlation between rl-sage and mpss or oligoarray data was not significant. the low correlation between rl-sage and oligoarray might be because that oligoarray probes are designed from the protein coding regions of the annotated genes and a large number of rl-sage tags are located in the  <dig> bp downstream regions . we speculate that a low correlation between mpss and rl-sage is due to the following two reasons. first, the use of different anchoring enzymes would change the location of the mpss and rl-sage tags within a given transcript. we found that the majority of the mpss tags matched the protein coding regions and the majority of rl-sage tags matched within  <dig> bp downstream . in some cases, because the m. grisea annotation is incomplete, the mpss and rl-sage tags derived from the same transcript may be mapped to two different predicted genes. second, mpss and rl-sage use two completely different library construction and sequencing procedures. any bias in the pcr amplification of synthesized cdnas could lead to generation of different tag populations. nonetheless, these data provide the first detailed analysis of transcriptional activity in an important fungal pathogen of plants, and constitutes a starting point for large-scale functional analysis of many novel fungal genes identified in the study.

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced one rl-sage library of mycelia and two mpss libraries of appressoria and mycelia of m. grisea. using the same rna samples of appressoria and mycelia, oligoarray hybridization was performed to check if these three approaches can detect similar sets of expressed genes in m. grisea. the distinct transcripts detected by mpss and rl-sage in appressoria and mycelia ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which correspond to about  <dig>  genes, representing 80% of the predicted genes in m. grisea  <cit> . a low to moderate correlation among the expression data from the three platforms was observed. mpss and rl-sage methods identified many novel sense and antisense transcripts, which are differentially expressed at the two important growth stages of m. grisea. the identified novel transcripts, especially those specifically expressed in appressoria, are valuable genomic resource for a better understanding of the molecular basis of m. grisea pathogenicity. the established mpss and rl-sage websites provide useful genomics resource for the public. the microarray  and rl-sage  data were deposited at the ncbi-geo website and also the mpss data can be downloaded at the m. grisea mpss website  <cit> .
