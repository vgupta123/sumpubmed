BACKGROUND
a widely established model to explain the evolutionary origin of novel genes is gene duplication . however, recent phylogenetic evidence suggests that de-novo formation might be an alternative, important source for the de novo origin of orphan genes  <cit> . this is corroborated by findings that long non-coding rna may serve as a novelty pool and that ribosomes indeed translate novel orfs  <cit> . it is hypothesized that this mechanism might produce novel domains or folds, which are added to existing genes or assembled to new genes  <cit> .

in eukaryotes, large parts of the genome do not harbor protein-coding genes, potentially providing dna raw material for novel genes  <cit> . in contrast, prokaryotic genomes are densely packed with genes and inter-genic space is quite limited. therefore, as early as  <dig>  grassé proposed a mechanism for the evolution of novel genes termed “overprinting”  <cit> , which some years later was substantiated by ohno  <cit> . according to this hypothesis, a previously non-coding sequence, overlapping an existing gene in an alternate reading frame, is transformed into a coding sequence by the creation of a new promoter next to a suitable ribosome binding site and a start codon. alternatively, a gene may elongate through the emergence of an alternative start codon further upstream or the loss of its original stop codon, leading to an overlap with an adjacent gene. this mechanism of overprinting is an option to solve the de-novo evolution problem for prokaryotes.

trivial overlaps of only a few base pairs are found in about 30 % of the bacterial genes  <cit> . the likely benefit is a translational coupling of both genes, since the stop codon of the upstream located gene overlaps with the start codon of the downstream gene  <cit> . in non-trivially overlapping genes the protein coding regions are embedded completely or substantially in the annotated “mother gene”, which by definition occupies reading frame + <dig>  and are encoded by one of the five alternate reading frames. non-trivially overlapping genes are generally assumed to be very rare. this assumption is due to a severe information content constraint since single mutations often affect the protein function of both overlapping genes. thus, such an arrangement is believed to be less likely to be beneficial for the organism carrying the overlapping gene pair  <cit> .

the majority of non-trivial overlapping genes have been described in viruses  and their emergence was attributed to a hypothetical selection pressure acting on the size of the viral genome, exerted by spatial limitations of the capsid  <cit> . in sharp contrast, in prokaryotes only very few overlapping gene pairs are known. in the extremely well-researched escherichia coli, as far as we know, only three overlapping gene pairs have been described: htga/yaaw  <cit> , yghw/mora  <cit> , and tnpa/asta  <cit> .

here we report on direct experimental evidence indicating the presence of a novel overlapping gene pair in enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h <dig> str. edl <dig>  which was found during the investigation of the transcriptomic response of ehec to a number of environmental conditions  <cit> . the novel overlapping gene nog <dig> is completely embedded − <dig> antisense in its mother reading frame citc which is part of the operon citcdefxg. this operon is responsible for citrate fermentation. citc is induced anaerobically and encodes the citrate lyase ligase which activates the γ-subunit of the citrate lyase  <cit> . in addition to a functional analysis of nog <dig>  we provide evidence that this overlapping gene may be restricted to the escherichia/shigella/salmonella clade and probably arose recently by genetic overprinting.

construction of gfp fusions and fluorescence measurement
the region 365 bp and 361 bp upstream of the start codons of citc and nog <dig> respectively was amplified from genomic ehec-dna  using primer ggc ggt cga ccg gtg cct ttt aac acc aga tc  and aca gaa ttc gaa ctg ata aac ctc gcc tat g  and the primers ggc ggt cga caa aga tac gca gcg gaa atg c  and aca gaa ttc tgg gag aaa ggg ggg tga tcg a  respectively. the pcr products were digested with the appropriate enzymes  according to the manufacturer  and ligated in pprobe-nt  <cit>  using t4-ligase . ehec was transformed with the plasmids and was grown under shaking at 37 °c in the dark in lb medium  <cit>  supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin. for aerobic growth, 1: <dig> diluted overnight cultures were used to inoculate 10 ml 1: <dig> diluted lb with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and cells were grown at 37 °c for 4 h until the culture reached od600nm =  <dig> in plain lb medium. induction of the promoter fusion was tested using 100 mm  <dig> -propanediol, 20 mm cscl,  <dig>  mm cucl <dig>  25 mm cycloheximide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 78 μm erythromycin, 200 mm formamide, 4 mm hcooh, 2 mm glutamine, 200 mm mgcl <dig>  320 μm menadione, 400 mm nacl, 10 mm 1-methylimidazole, 10 mm propanedioic acid,  <dig>  mm salicin, 16 mm na3vo <dig>  and 10 mm na2b4o <dig> 

for anaerobic growth, bacteria were grown in 15 ml medium as above in tightly closed 15-ml falcons. anaerobiosis was tested using resazurin in separate tubes. all cultures, including an empty-vector control, were grown for approximately 7 h to od600nm =  <dig>  in the dark. to allow gfp to mature to fluorescence, anaerobically grown cultures were aerated for 15 min by shaking in larger bottles. bacteria were washed once with 1 ml pbs  and diluted to od600nm =  <dig> . two-hundred μl of this suspension was measured for fluorescence using a black microtiter plate and a plate reader . the mean value of four replicate wells was calculated and the experiment was repeated three times.

overexpression of nog <dig> and western blot
the open reading frame of nog <dig> and its upstream region was amplified via pcr using primer gat ccc atg gcg gtg cct ttt aac acc aga tc  and gag cga att cg ttt gca aca ttg aac aac att . the amplicon was cloned in the ncoi and ecori restriction sites of pbad myc-his c  resulting in pbad-nog1::myc-his. the plasmid was sequenced for verification and ehec were transformed with pbad-nog1::myc-his or with pbad myc-his c as control. one-and-a-half l of 1: <dig> diluted lb medium supplemented with 120 μg/ml ampicillin and 320 μm menadione were inoculated 1: <dig> with an overnight culture of the transformants. bacteria were grown in six 1-l bottles , shaking at 37 °c to od600nm =  <dig> . bacteria were pelleted  and resuspended in 15 ml lysis buffer included in the qiaexpress® ni-nta fast start kit . the cells were sonicated six times for 15 s  and proteins were purified under native conditions according to the manufacturer’s protocol. from the empty control, a mock sample was ‘purified’. proteins were precipitated with acetone and laemmli-buffer was added. the sample was heated for 5 min at 95 °c and loaded on a 15 % sds-gel. one well was loaded with 5 μl of the pageruler prestained protein ladder  for size determination. after sds-page, the proteins were transferred to a pvdf membrane . transfer to the membrane was carried out in blotting buffer  for 10 min at 150 ma. next, the membrane was blocked for 1 h in tbs-t  supplemented with 1 % bsa at room temperature. the membrane was then incubated with 5 ng/μl bd pharmingen mouse anti-human c-myc-antibody  in tbs-t plus 1 % bsa. after washing twice in tbs-t for 10 min, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the second antibody  anti-mouse chimera, 6 ng/μl) in tbs-t plus 1 % bsa. the membrane was washed twice for 10 min with tbs-t and equilibrated in ap-buffer . for the final detection of the fusion proteins, the membrane was incubated with  <dig>  mg/ml bcip and  <dig>  mg/ml nbt solution in ap buffer.

construction of translationally arrested mutants
chromosomal dna was modified for the Δnog <dig> and Δcitc mutants using plasmid pmrs <dig>  <cit> . for Δnog <dig>  two fragments of this gene were amplified using primers cat ttt cat gaa gga att ggg  and ata cta gta ttt cac gcc gaa ata ctc c  and the primer ccc aat tcc ttc atg aaa atg  and gcg ggc cca aca gcg cct cgt att cgg t . mutated bases in the primers and the added restriction sites are marked bold and italic respectively. the two nog1-fragments are located up- and downstream of the desired mutation and overlap in this area. the fragments were used in a third pcr using primer z0762-59f-spei and z0762+382r-apai to recreate a complete fragment with the mutation. this was conducted accordingly for Δcitc using the primer pairs tgt tat cga tct tca acg aat gt  and ata cta gtt aaa tca att aaa tca ctt a , and primer pair aca ttc gtt gaa gat cga taa ca  and gcg ggc ccg att cac tga tag caa cgc a . the final pcr products were cloned in the spei and apai sites of pmrs <dig>  and transformants grown in lb medium plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin. the high-copy number ori was removed by restriction with noti and subsequent self-ligation. the remaining plasmid contains a second low-copy pir-dependent ori. this plasmid was introduced into e. coli cc118λpir via electroporation, cells were grown in lb medium plus 30 μg/ml streptomycin, and the plasmid sequence was verified by sequencing using either primer ctt atc gat gat aag ctg tc  or tca atc atg cga aac gat cc . plasmids were transferred to e. coli sm10λpir, which enables conjugation, and integrated in ehec nalr via plate mating: each 500 μl overnight culture was mixed, plated on lb agar, and incubated for 24 h at 30 °c. cells were resuspended in lb and plated on lb-plates containing 30 μg/ml streptomycin and 20 μg/ml nalidic acid. the correct insertion of the suicide plasmid was confirmed using primers pmrs101+184 f and ctt gcg ggt tgt ccc gag cc  for Δnog <dig> or Δcitc from genomic dna of the trans-conjugants. to facilitate a second cross-over, cultures were grown in plain lb to od600nm =  <dig>  and counter-selected on sucrose agar . a pcr fragment using primers ttc agt cgc gtg gcg ctg tt  and ctt gcg ggt tgt ccc gag cc  obtained from the chromosome was sequenced to identify the desired strand-specific mutants of either nog <dig> or citc.

growth curves of individual strains
overnight cultures of ehec wild type, Δcitc and Δnog <dig> were used to inoculate 100 ml  <dig>  × lb medium supplemented with 200 mm mgcl <dig> in 250-ml schott bottles at an od600nm =  <dig> . bacteria were grown at 37 °c under shaking  and the od600nm was recorded at given time points.

competitive growth assays
overnight cultures in lb were adjusted to od600nm =  <dig> and the two test strains were mixed in equal numbers. control samples were taken immediately . half-strength lb medium  was inoculated 1: <dig>  using the bacterial mixture. bacteria were grown under shaking at 150 rpm for 18 h at 37 °c, harvested by centrifugation  and boiled for 5 min at 95 °c to release the dna. each sample was used as template for pcr with a locus specific primer pair gtt tgc aac att gaa caa cat tcg , and gac tgt ggt gtc aac gct caa atc , for Δnog <dig> or Δcitc versus wild type. pcr products were purified and sequenced  using primer z0762+21f for Δnog <dig> and primer z0762+172r for Δcitc. for competitive growth experiments between Δnog <dig> and Δcitc, pcr products were generated using primer ttc agt cgc gtg gcg ctg tt  and ctt gcg ggt tgt ccc gag cc . the pcr product was sequenced using primer z0762+460r. after sequencing, the ratios between peak heights from the sanger sequencing of the alleles were determined and expressed as a percentage of each strain. this experiment was repeated at least three times.

to complement the translational arrested mutant Δnog <dig>  nog <dig> was cloned on the arabinose-inducible plasmid pbad myc-his c  using a pcr-product generated with the following primers gat ccc atg gca gtg gct aat gtc agc gcc ag  and gag cga att ctc agt ttg caa cat tga aca ac . the amplicon was cut with ncoi and ecori and ligated into the plasmid using t4-ligase. the plasmid sequence was verified by sequencing. the translational arrested mutant was transformed either with an empty plasmid  or with the overexpression plasmid pbad-nog <dig>  a wild type transformed with the empty vector was used as control. these control bacteria and complemented mutants of nog <dig> were grown in competitive assays as described above in medium supplemented with 120 μg/ml ampicillin  and  <dig>  % arabinose . the percentage of “complemented mutants” versus “control bacteria” was determined as described above after 18 h of competitive growth.

metabolomics
for a full description of the metabolome measurements see additional file 2: file s <dig>  in short, the following strategies have been applied.

metabolomes by gc-ms
the methanol-soluble part of the metabolome was determined from six biologically independent cultures of mutant and wild-type, respectively. briefly, flash frozen bacteria were extracted derivatized for metabolite analysis via gc-ms in a two-step procedure as described  <cit> . for metabolite profiling a hp agilent  <dig> gas chromatograph was used to perform gc analysis and coupled to an agilent  <dig> quadrupole mass spectrometer  for mass determination. the software metabolitedetector  was used for processing. differences in the metabolome between wild type and the mutants were tested for significance using student’s test .

metabolomes by icr-ft/ms
sample preparation was carried out as above for three biological replicates of each wild type, Δnog <dig> and Δcitc mutants. metabolite profiling was conducted using ion cyclotron resonance fourier transform mass spectrometry  on a bruker solarix equipped with a 12 t magnet . putative metabolites were annotated using the masstrix webserver  <cit> . statistical analysis was carried out in ms excel  <dig> and genedata expressionist for ms  <dig>   using welch’s t test   <cit> .

bioinformatics methods
σ <dig> promoters were searched for using bprom , and terminators using webgester db  <cit> . sequences from other bacteria were searched with blastp or tblastn . all methods mentioned in the following were used with preset values. domain search was conducted using cdd  <cit>  with an e value cut-off of 10− <dig>  the distribution of charged amino acids in nog <dig> was analyzed manually. prediction of disordered regions was conducted using globplot  <cit>  and meta-disorder  <cit>  the authors of globplot claim for a given prediction a specificity of 88 % and a sensitivity of 28 %  <cit> . for meta-disorder, the preset reliability index suggests to find about 52 % of the disordered residues and 68 % of those would be correct  <cit> . low complexity regions were discovered using cdd  <cit>  which implements sdust with preset values  <cit> . the transmembrane and overall topology was predicted using hmmtop  <cit> , tmhmm  <cit> , phdhtm  <cit> , and bcl::jufo9d  <cit> . the program hmmtop correctly predicts 89 % of the membrane spanning regions and 71 % of the correct topology  <cit> . tmhmm correctly predicts 97-98 % of the transmembrane helices. the specificity and sensitivity of this program is greater than 99 % if no signal peptide is present  <cit> . phdhtm predicts the topology for helical transmembrane proteins at 86 % accuracy  <cit> . finally, bcl::jufo9d has a prediction accuracies of  <dig>  % the secondary structure prediction, and  <dig>  % for the transmembrane span prediction  <cit> . beta-turns were predicted using netturnp  <cit> . sensitivity is 76 % and specificity 79 %, respectively, in distinguishing turns from not-turns  <cit> . the protein secondary structure was established using sopma  <cit> , psipred  <cit> , pred2ary  <cit> , and gor iv  <cit>  via the web server nps@  <cit> ; profseq  <cit>  via the predictprotein server  <cit> , bcl::jufo9d  <cit> , or using porter  <cit> . sopma correctly predicts  <dig>  % of amino acids for a three-state description  of the secondary structure  <cit> . the current psipred  <dig>  achieves an average q <dig> score of  <dig>  %  <cit> . for pred2ary, the secondary structure prediction accuracy was given as 63 %  <cit> , and gor iv has a mean accuracy of  <dig>  % for q <dig>  <cit> . profseq has an overall accuracy of  <dig>  % and a sustained q <dig> of 88 % for 40 % of the residues  <cit> . bcl::jufo9d has prediction accuracies of  <dig>  % for nine possible states, and  <dig>  % for the q <dig> secondary structure prediction  <cit> . finally, porter's accuracy exceeds 79 %  <cit> . protein binding sites were predicted using isis, which has total two-state accuracy of 68 %  <cit> . protein statistics were calculated using protparam  <cit> , signal protein sequences were searched for using signalp  <cit> , and the protein localization was predicted using loctree <dig>  this program reaches a six-state accuracy  of 89 ± 4 % for bacteria  <cit> .

tree construction
the evolutionary tree is based on a concatemer of the conserved genes 16s rrna, atpd, adk, gyrb, pura and reca and is independent of citc/nog <dig>  the gene sequences were obtained from the genome of each organism . all the above-mentioned genes of each organism were concatenated and aligned using muscle in mega <dig>   <cit>  with default parameters. the alignment was checked and since this original alignment had gaps , all nucleotides in the respective column which had a gap were manually removed by deleting this column until no gap remained in the complete final alignment. in addition, positions  in which ambiguities were present, were manually deleted as well. there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset . mega <dig>  allows precomputation of the best nucleotide substitution model for maximum likelihood  to match the data, including general time reversible, hasegawa-kishino-yano, tamura-nei, tamura 3-parameter, kimura 2-parameter, and jukes-cantor. non-uniformity of evolutionary rates among sites may or may not be modeled by using a discrete gamma distribution  with  <dig> rate categories and by assuming that a certain fraction of sites are evolutionarily invariable . the model with the lowest bayesian information criterion score is considered to best describe the substitution pattern  <cit> , which is general time reversible with gamma distribution and invariable sites in this case. for the precomputation, the tree topology was automatically computed using neighbor-joining.

the final evolutionary history was inferred by using the ml method based on the general time reversible model. the tree with the highest log likelihood  is shown. values within the tree indicate the percentage of  <dig> bootstrap tests showing the same cluster. bootstrap values below 50 % are not shown. initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained by applying the neighbor-joining method to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the maximum composite likelihood  approach. a discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites . the rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable. the final tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site.

RESULTS
discovery of an overlapping protein-coding orf displaying protein-coding features
in previous experiments, ehec was grown under eleven different growth conditions and strand specific transcriptomes were sequenced  <cit> . these conditions comprised lb medium at ph <dig>  ph <dig>  ph <dig>  or at 15 °c; lb with addition of nitrite or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; lb-agar surface, m <dig> minimal medium, spinach leaf juice, the surface of living radish sprouts, and cow dung. in the condition “cow dung”, we found a novel rna to be induced about 14-fold compared to lb, based on rpkm values . briefly, for the condition “cow dung”, 10 g cattle feces were inoculated for 6 h at 37 °c with ehec pre-grown in lb  <cit> . this rna covers an overlapping orf which consists of 306 bp  and is completely embedded in antisense to citc in frame - <dig> . thus, we wondered whether this novel rna was maybe protein coding and undertook experiments to verify this hypothesis. to facilitate further reading, we introduce the suggested gene name nog <dig> here .fig.  <dig> 
a strand-specific transcription signals of nog <dig>  shown are the transcriptome data of ehec  grown aerobically in 1: <dig> diluted lb medium  or incubated in cow dung . the transcriptome sequencing reads are shown above or below the genome line for the forward and reverse strand respectively. only a single read of citc is visible in the lb-condition. however, nog <dig>  is induced about 14-fold in cow dung compared to lb, based on rpkm values. the lower panel shows the genomic architecture around citc, drawn using artemis  <cit> . the open reading frames of nog <dig> and citc are indicated by blue arrows in the respective reading frames. b fluorescence units of nog <dig> c-terminally fused with gfp after iptg induction for 2 h using the indicated inducer concentrations. this experiment shows that nog <dig> is principally able to be translated by ribosomes. c genetic organization of nog <dig>  grey, predicted promoter ; orange letter, transcription start site according to the transcriptome sequencing data ; orange arrow, transcription start site according to 5’-race; underlined, possible shine-dalgarno sequences; green, predicted start codon; blue, coding sequence; red, stop codon; bases highlighted by bold underline, predicted rho independent terminator with possible hairpin structure 



the novel orf nog <dig> was c-terminally fused in frame to gfp to determine protein production. after induction, gfp fluorescence was increased compared to the uninduced control showing that the novel orf nog <dig> is indeed translatable . however, we could not detect nog <dig> induced from its natural promoter and fused to his and myc tags . despite enrichment using ni-columns and acetone precipitation, his-myc-tagged nog <dig> was not detectable in western blots using myc-tag antibodies. but acetone precipitation is prone to lose small proteins and nog <dig> is predicted to be unstable and a membrane protein , which may have rendered immunological detection of this short protein difficult. however, the above nog1::gfp fusion shows that the ribosomes pass the gtg start codon to translate the nog <dig> orf.

next, we predicted promoter, shine-dalgarno and terminator sequences for nog <dig>  all of which were found . a possible transcription start site in the vicinity of the predicted promoter could be the read mapping farthest upstream in the strand-specific transcriptome sequencing . the read starts 40 bp upstream of the putative start codon. to verify this position, the + <dig> was determined using 5’-race. the latter result is in perfect agreement with the former since the indicated transcription start site of the new orf was also found to be 40 bp upstream of the putative start codon gtg. thus, this position is suggested to be the major + <dig> for nog <dig> .

promoter activities of the genomic regions upstream of nog <dig> and citc
the promoter region immediately upstream of nog <dig> was fused to gfp and tested for inducibility. unfortunately, cow dung was not usable for these experiments due to the opaqueness, autofluorescence, and the many other bacteria present in this substrate. sterile filtration before and after dilution was attempted, but extremely difficult due to the high content in fine particulate matter. to ease analysis, we decided to test lb medium supplemented with a number of various inorganic and organic stressors in sub-inhibitory concentrations for promoter activity . using lb medium as a control, promoter pnog <dig> activity was increased when cells were grown aerobically in the presence of 320 μm menadione , 5 mm malonic acid , and 150 mm magnesium chloride . the transcription of citc is only induced in the presence of citrate under anaerobic conditions  <cit> , thus, these conditions were tested additionally . pcitc becomes active about 2-fold when bacteria are grown anaerobically with the addition of 20 mm citrate. interestingly, pnog <dig> activity increased under anaerobiosis in plain lb, as well as in citrate supplemented lb , and, in addition, when adding menadione  or malonic acid .fig.  <dig> fluorescence measurements of promoter::gfp fusions for empty vector control , pcitc  and pnog <dig> . the fluorescence has been normalized to od600nm and the conditions are indicated



metabolome of the translationally arrested mutants compared to the wild type
to uncover phenotypes related to the gene product nog <dig>  its translation was arrested by introducing a stop codon without changing the amino acid sequence of the mother reading frame citc . similarly, citc was arrested without changing nog <dig> . if nog <dig> were being a non-coding rna, its function would not be disturbed by a single nucleotide exchange. in contrast, translation is arrested by the artificial stop codon and nog <dig> production ceases. the metabolome of the mutant compared to wild type was analyzed by non-targeted profiling approaches using either gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry  or ion cyclotron resonance fourier transform mass spectrometry .fig.  <dig> mutations introduced to arrest the translation of nog <dig>  or citc  strand specifically. the numbers indicate the distance of the sequence shown from the start codons of nog <dig> and citc respectively. note that the amino acid sequence of the reading frame in antisense remains unchanged in both cases. the positions of the mutations are shown in red



for gc-ms, six biological replicates of both wild type and Δnog <dig> were grown in plain lb and significantly different metabolites determined . only a decrease of metabolites in the nog1-mutant was found. for instance, tryptophan had the highest fold decrease of about  <dig> . next were citric and isocitric acid, as well as succinate with a decrease of about  <dig>  to 2-fold . hence, we believe there is a slight influence of the Δnog <dig> mutation on the primary metabolism, probably with a focus on the tca cycle due to changes in citrate and succinate.

using the more sensitive and accurate icr-ft/ms for profiling, several thousand features were detected  and masstrix  <cit>  annotated several hundred metabolites from different pathways. significantly different molecules between wild type and mutant  included metabolites, e.g., of the glutathione metabolism . furthermore, amino acid metabolism pathways were affected, since corresponding metabolites were found to be changed . the latter fits with the observed change in tryptophan levels in the gc-ms experiment above. gc-ms and icr-ft/ms complement each other. icr-ft/ms is not able to detect small masses, e.g., of tricarboxylic acid cycle  intermediates, but glutathione metabolites were not identifiable in the gc-ms experiment. however, targeted investigations are needed to further support the above results since only a weak metabolic phenotype is found in both assays.

fitness of translationally arrested nog <dig> and citc mutants
when wild type and Δnog <dig> mutant were grown separately under a variety of stress conditions, no differences in growth rates were observed , except a slightly reduced growth of the Δnog <dig> mutant in medium supplemented with mgcl <dig> . in contrast, competitive growth assays comparing two strains  in the same flask are highly sensitive tools to detect even small fitness differences between two strains  <cit> . for competition experiments, the two strains were mixed in equivalent small cell numbers  and broth supplemented with mgcl <dig> at sub-inhibitory concentration was inoculated using the strain mixture. a change in relative fitness between the two strains becomes apparent by determining the fraction of one strain over the other. after 18 h of aerobic growth, the performance of each strain was measured . interestingly, Δnog <dig> shows a clear loss of fitness compared to its parental strain when grown in plain lb. when using mgcl2-supplemented broth, the decrease in fitness of Δnog <dig> was even more pronounced, corroborating the finding of retarded growth in mgcl2-supplemented medium . a mutant translationally arrested in citc, however, did not show any fitness differences when competitively grown against its parental strain . accordingly, when Δnog <dig> was grown competitively against Δcitc a similar decrease in fitness was observed comparable to the wild type strain, both in plain lb and medium supplemented with mgcl <dig> fig.  <dig> growth phenotype of wild type, and Δcitc and Δnog <dig>

for complementation experiments, the nog <dig> orf was cloned downstream of an arabinose inducible promoter in the plasmid pbad. at first, the translationally arrested Δnog <dig> mutant and wild type, both transformed with an empty pbad, were grown competitively in mgcl2-supplemented medium. unexpectedly, the difference in competition, visible when using vector-less strains in this medium, diminished somewhat. next, Δnog <dig> was transformed with pbad::nog <dig> to compete against the wild type containing an empty pbad. the Δnog <dig> strain containing pbad::nog <dig> competed better against wild type containing the pbad vector, although it could not be fully restored . we hypothesize that the indispensable addition of ampicillin and arabinose to the latter experiments disturbed the competition experiments to some extent.

bioinformatics analysis of the nog <dig> protein sequence
the new overlapping-encoded protein nog <dig> is predicted to have  <dig> amino acids, a theoretical molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, a pi of  <dig> , an aliphatic index of  <dig> , and the gravy value is  <dig>   <cit> . no signal peptide or domain was predicted  <cit> . the instability index was computed to be  <dig>  which classifies the protein as being unstable  <cit> . secondary structures and membrane domains were predicted, using a number of similar programs allowing comparison of the results for different algorithms. this assumes that secondary structures predicted by several programs are possibly more reliable. the nog <dig> protein structure potentially consists of three short helices and several very short β-sheets. at least one membrane domain was predicted by all algorithms used . the protein may be localized in the inner membrane according to the software loctree <dig>  <cit> , most likely with the n-terminus outside and the c-terminus inside, as agreed on by two of three programs for transmembrane topology prediction  <cit> .

in order to elucidate the phylogeny of nog <dig>  a phylogenetic tree including ehec was constructed of species harboring citc  with helicobacter as an out-group . the phylogenetic tree calculation was independent of citc since it was based on a concatemer of 16s rdna, atpd, adk, gyrb, pura and reca. all six genes belong to the core genome of the species included in the analysis. homologs of citc were then analyzed for the presence of nog <dig> in their − <dig> antisense reading frame. the full reading frame nog <dig> was found in escherichia or shigella. in a few instances, its reading frame was destroyed, for example due to an insertion sequence or a frame shift which also destroyed citc . several salmonella species contain a nog1-like part in their citc sequence. depending on the salmonella strain, nog <dig> appears to be either elongated or fragmented, but whether nog <dig> is indeed functional in some salmonella strains remains unknown. in all other genera, the nog <dig> reading frame is clearly fragmented .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of nog1-bearing e. coli and shigella strains and species carrying nog1-like sequences. on the left, phylogenetic tree of representative bacterial strains containing a nog <dig> or nog1-like open reading frame within citc. the tree was inferred using the maximum likelihood method and is based on a concatemer of 16 s rna, atpd, adk, gyrb, pura, and reca, thus, independent of citc and nog <dig> respectively. the percentage of trees which clustered together in  <dig> bootstrap replicates is shown next to the branches. helicobacter was used as out-group. on the right, an alignment of nog <dig> and nog1-like sequences within citc of the strains is shown. black, sequence parts which can be aligned to nog <dig> of ehec using blast <dig> and which might be translated; turquoise, n-terminal methionine; pink, translational stop; blue, frame shift mutation ; red, insertion of is <dig> and duplicated amino acids proalaile around the insertion site; this insertion also destroys nog <dig> and citc. orange, regions likely not to be translated; green, insertion element in some salmonella and citrobacter strains, keeping the frames intact



discussion
nog <dig> probably encodes the protein nog1
in this paper we report that nog <dig> possesses an active promoter, activated in natural as well as lab conditions . a transcription start was determined, the gene is followed by a terminator sequence  and a protein can be expressed . in addition, we provided ample evidence that the ∆nog <dig> mutant shows a weak phenotype, especially in mgcl2-supplemented medium . this data clearly shows that the gene is functional, although of apparently minor influence to the fitness of e. coli.

we were successful in demonstrating a stable gene product at the protein level when fusing nog <dig> to gfp and detecting the latter by its fluorescence  but one could still hypothesize, despite this finding, that nog <dig> actually may encode a novel ncrna rather than a protein in vivo. a number of relatively short rnas are not translated and might function solely as ncrnas at the rna level  <cit> . however, we suggest rejecting the “non-coding rna hypothesis” of nog <dig> for the following five reasons.

first, a bioinformatics analysis of the open reading frame of nog <dig>  shows clear characteristics of a protein encoding orf, including a ribosome binding site in proper distance from the start codon. while it cannot be excluded that such sequence characteristics may occur just by chance, we consider this to be a remote option  <cit> . second, if nog <dig> regulates citc via antisense silencing, nog <dig> should only be induced when citc mrna is present  <cit> . however, nog <dig> is induced in cow dung where no transcript of citc could be detected . promoter studies of this and other work show that citc is expressed only under anaerobic conditions, but nog <dig> was also detectable in aerobic conditions. thus, it is quite unlikely that nog <dig> acts as regulatory rna in an anti-sense fashion against citc since, for antisense-rna regulation, the presence and base pairing of both sense and antisense transcripts is required  <cit> . third, the introduction of a single base pair change only, to translationally arrest nog <dig>  leads to a clear phenotype which would not be expected when nog <dig> is an antisense regulator. also, a hypothetical ribozyme activity would require stable base pairing involving many nucleotides  <cit> . single base pair changes, such as those used in this study to translationally arrest nog <dig> , are unlikely to cause detectable differences in an rna-rna pairing event which involves many base pairs. fourth, a translationally arrested Δcitc mutant which introduced a nucleotide change synonymous in the overlapping nog <dig> did not, as was expected, display any fitness differences in competitive growth experiments . finally, supplementing the Δnog <dig> strain with a functional nog <dig> on a plasmid in trans means that nog <dig> is produced, and the strain competes somewhat better against wild type in mgcl2-supplemented medium . however, if nog <dig> acts as ncrna, this strain should compete even less against the wild type since the gene dosage of the plasmid-borne gene is higher and more ncrna would be present to regulate its targets.

potential function of nog1
transcription of nog <dig> is specifically induced in cow dung , and the promoter is activated by magnesium ions , menadione and malonic acid. in addition, magnesium ions had an effect on growth of Δnog <dig> in growth and competitive growth assays . however, the function of nog <dig> remains cryptic. it would have been interesting to elucidate the function of nog <dig> in cow dung further, but this is a difficult substrate to work with. for this reason we relied on lab media. changes in metabolite concentrations of the Δnog <dig> mutant are small compared to wild type in plain lb, so nog <dig> is only slightly involved in any central metabolic reaction . since the ∆nog <dig> mutant displayed a small growth disadvantage in mgcl2-supplemented medium , bacteria carrying nog <dig> may have an increased fitness in environments reflecting this or other unknown conditions. whatever function this gene exerts, its modificatory action is at least strong enough to cause a phenotype in a competitive growth assay. since, according to the bioinformatics analysis, nog <dig> is membrane bound, it could either act as sensor or modificatory protein in the membrane. however, further experiments would have to support this hypothesis.

recent origin of nog <dig> by overprinting
the citrate-lyase ligase gene citc, which is the mother gene of nog <dig>  is taxonomically broadly distributed . in contrast, nog <dig> is found only in the escherichia/salmonella clade. such a taxonomical distribution could be explained by an ancient overprinting event followed by many subsequent deletions of the nog <dig> reading frame in all clades except the escherichia/salmonella clade. however, for parsimony reasons we suggest a recent origin of nog <dig> after the separation of escherichia/salmonella from the rest of the enterobacteria .

based largely on research in eukaryotes, recently arisen genes are thought to be shorter and less important compared to genes with a longer evolutionary history  <cit> . after a short evolutionary history, novel genes should be less well-integrated in the cellular metabolism and, therefore, may provide only a limited fitness gain for the cell. since young genes are expected to be not yet well-adapted, due to their short evolutionary history, they may be expressed at a low level only. new genes should be orphans  <cit>  and overlapping genes have been proposed to be phylogenetically more restricted than the mother gene they overlap  <cit> . finally, de novo formed genes may have a strain specific function only  <cit> , which could be important for niche specific adaptations assumed for orphan genes  <cit> .

we suggest that nog <dig>  embedded completely in its mother frame citc, offers a number of characteristics which fit the hypothesis of nog <dig> being a young gene:  nog <dig> shows a restricted occurrence within the closely related genera of escherichia/salmonella,  the gene is short,  it is weakly expressed,  it appears to be only marginally associated in e. coli’s central metabolism, and  the gene product provides only a small fitness advantage for its carrier. conversely, the mother frame citc is widely distributed among many bacterial species since it is important to metabolize citrate  under anaerobic growth conditions  <cit> . thus, we hypothesize that nog <dig> may have arisen by a recent overprinting event, probably after the split of the escherichia/shigella clade or after the divergence of escherichia/salmonella from the other γ-proteobacteria .

CONCLUSIONS
according to nekrutenko & he  <cit>  “ genes with overlapping reading frames exemplify some of the most striking biological phenomena ”. this is a statement with which we agree, especially since johnson and chisholm  <cit>  proposed an information content constraint which should prevent non-trivially overlapping genes to form freely. indeed, the initial sequence features of the citc mother reading frame, which would allow for a successful overprinting process producing a nog <dig> protein with at least a weak initial function, are unknown and certainly require further investigation.

bacteriological research has never been directed to discover overlapping genes. on the contrary, bacterial genome annotation programs systematically remove overlapping genes , thereby efficiently preventing their discovery. perhaps it is not surprising that with the exception of e. coli’s three overlapping genes, only a few further examples have been discovered rather accidentally in streptomyces  <cit> , pseudomonas  <cit>  or xanthomonas  <cit> . functional analyses of overlapping genes in bacteria are even rarer.

bacterial overlapping genes may be more common than expected
four lines of argument lead us to suggest that overlapping genes in bacteria are more common than is currently assumed by microbiologists.

first, a systematic bioinformatics analysis of bacterial overlapping orfs demonstrates that bacterial genomes contain a larger number of long overlapping orfs than is expected based on a statistical analysis  <cit> . random mutational drift would have eliminated this signal long ago if no selection pressures were stabilizing these orfs. indeed, sabath, et al.  <cit>  found that overlapping loci are under weak positive selection.

second, during various comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of e. coli targeted to its differential gene expression in different habitats  <cit> , we have noticed that many overlapping reading frames show a transcriptional signal which is clearly above background and is probably not due to ncrna . such signals might be evidence for the existence of further overlapping genes.

third, a bioinformatics analysis suggests that overlapping genes appear abundantly in some viruses  <cit> . there is good evidence that all bacteria are parasitized by viruses and bacteriophage vastly outnumber bacterial cells on earth  <cit> . furthermore, genomes of bacterial viruses are constantly being mixed, by various mechanisms, with the genomes of their hosts, which should result in an increase of overlapping genes in bacteria  <cit> .

fourth, for eukaryotes it has been suggested that completely new genes evolve frequently de novo from non-coding dna and for a few cases even overprinting has been suggested  <cit> . since prokaryotic genomes are densely packed with established genes  <cit> , that source for novel genes is almost absent and we suggest overprinting as a more important alternative to gene duplication for these organisms acquisition of completely novel genes. this exploits a huge hypothetical hidden coding reserve potentially providing a “novelty pool“ for adaptation  <cit> .

while in this paper we have presented specific experimental evidence for the existence of a fourth overlapping gene in e. coli ehec, we suggest that this may be an initial finding only. for the origin of gene novelties in bacteria, such cases of new overlapping genes could lead to the establishment of overprinting as a potentially more significant alternative to gene duplication, once microbiologists and evolutionary biologists start to target experimental research along this research path.
