BACKGROUND
despite recent progress in prevention and therapies, heart failure resulting from acute myocardial infarction or chronic myocardial ischemia remains the leading cause of mortality in developed countries  <cit> . the central cellular mechanism underlying myocardial dysfunction is an irreversible loss of viable cardiomyocytes and an inability of residual cardiomyocytes to compensate for this loss  <cit> . heart transplantation remains the final therapeutic option for end-stage heart failure  <cit> , but is limited by donor organ shortages and life-threatening complications, including organ rejection and side effects of pharmacological immune suppression. regenerative therapies, including cell injection and myocardial tissue engineering, have been pursued as new possibilities to repair the damaged myocardium. over the last decade, much research has focused on finding the ideal cell type to mediate myocardial repair. to date, cells derived from fetal or neonatal hearts have been applied to damaged myocardia to regenerate myocardial tissues in animal studies  <cit> , but a similar approach in humans poses ethical issues and may be insufficient to provide the large number of cardiomyocytes needed for clinical use  <cit> . developing methods to use stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes may be required.

the recent discovery of resident cardiac progenitor cells  in the postnatal heart has marked a new era of cardiac regenerative medicine. several laboratories have identified distinct populations of cpcs including side population  cells  <cit> , stem cell antigen-1-positive  cells  <cit> , c-kit-positive  cells  <cit> , islet-1-positive  cells  <cit> , wilms’ tumor 1-positive  epicardial progenitor cells  <cit> , and cardiosphere-derived cells   <cit> . however, the levels of resident cpcs in postnatal heart are limited and there is a clear negative correlation between cpc number and age  <cit> . furthermore, in clinical practice, cpcs may be more likely to be isolated from catheter-based tiny biopsy specimens rather than large masses of cardiac tissue. yet, large quantities of cpcs are needed for myocardium regeneration.

goumans’ team has developed a method for efficient isolation and expansion of human cpcs from cardiac surgical waste by magnetic cell sorting  and has developed a detailed protocol for very efficient in vitro differentiation of cpcs into cardiomyocytes   <cit> . however, it is unclear how many seed cells would be eventually obtained for regenerative therapies and whether their ‘stemness’ or differentiation potential would decline with long-term culture in vitro. in this report, we isolated sca-1+ cells from postnatal mouse heart by macs using an iron-labeled anti-mouse sca- <dig> antibody, and cultured the cells long-term in vitro. to monitor the stemness and differentiation potential of long-term cultured sca-1+ cells, we selected the 7th, 28th, and 53th passages to test early, middle and late phases of culture. we further identified these cells as sca-1+/cd31- cpc subpopulations, which are able to proliferate over the long-term in vitro without a detectable decline in stemness. in addition, they retain the potential to differentiate into multiple cardiac cell lineages.

RESULTS
isolation and in vitro culture of postnatal mouse heart-derived sca-1+ cells
macs is an efficient system for cell isolation, especially for rare cells in tissues  <cit> . we used this system to isolate resident stem cells from postnatal mice hearts, based on the expression of the surface marker stem cell antigen sca- <dig> . to verify the efficiency of macs using an iron-labeled anti-sca- <dig> antibody, we performed fcm to analyze the enrichment of sca-1+ cells in samples before and after macs. pre-macs, just after filtration through a 40-μm cell strainer, the whole cardiac cell suspension was composed of approximately  <dig> % sca-1+ cells. after macs, the sca-1+-enriched population contained approximately 85% sca-1+ cells, and the flow-through population contained only  <dig> % sca-1+ cells . viewed with an inverted microscopy in ordinary light, cells in sca-1+-enriched populations were sparse, with quasi-circular or oval morphology and homogenous in size, while cells in flow-through populations were crowded, containing diverse cell types and sizes . thus, the efficiency and specificity of macs were considered reasonable.

after seeding on gelatin-coated 12-well dishes, the long-term cell culture of sca-1+-enriched population was initiated. after about one week, small, flat, spindle-shaped cells appeared and grew gradually. many of these cells were phase-bright under white light. on day  <dig>  the primary cells  had grown to approximately 90% confluence and were propagated to p <dig> at 1: <dig>  that is, transferred from one well of the 12-well dish  to one well in a 6-well dish , also coated with gelatin. about 4 days after the first passage, cells of p <dig> were detached and further subcultured as p <dig> at 1:5; cells were transferred from one well of the 6-well dish  to one 9-cm dish  without gelatin coating. p <dig> cells were cultured in normal medium for 4 weeks, at which point they reached 90% confluence and were split at 1: <dig> to p <dig>  p <dig> grew more rapidly and was split after about 1 week. from then on, the subcultured cells were passaged every 3– <dig> days at different ratios. the sca-1+ cells were passaged to over p <dig> and still grew well with phase-brightness . there were no noticeable changes in gross morphology until at least p <dig> .

surface characteristics of sca-1+-enriched long-term cell culture
to identify the surface characteristics of heart-derived sca-1+-enriched cells and determine whether these would change during long-term in vitro culture, cells of p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> were analyzed for stem cell antigen sca- <dig> and other cell surface markers by fcm and if staining. fcm analysis showed that the percentage of sca-1+ cells increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % over p <dig> to p <dig>  this indicates that not only do the sca-1+-enriched passages still mainly consist of sca-1+ cells, but the purity of sca-1+ cells increases with passaging. few cells were detected that expressing c-kit, another stem cell marker; proportions varied from  <dig> - <dig> %. flk- <dig>  an endothelial progenitor cell marker, was also barely expressed. cd <dig>  a hematopoietic progenitor cell marker  <cit> , was initially expressed in  <dig> % of p <dig> cells, which declined to  <dig> % of cells at p <dig>  cd <dig>  a marker of endothelial cells  <cit>  and cd <dig>  a marker of the hematopoietic lineage  <cit>  were also both rarely expressed .

to further characterize the sca-1+ cells, we double labeled them with antibodies against sca- <dig> and cd <dig> , because sca-1+/cd31- cpcs show functional cardiomyogenic differentiation, and sca-1+/cd31+ cells do not  <cit> . based on fcm, there was strong expression of sca- <dig> in cells at p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  but few was sca-1+/cd31+ cells , which was confirmed by if staining. if staining showed that few cells expressed cd <dig> in sca-1+ enriched cell populations . these data indicate that the mouse heart-derived sca-1+ cells isolated here represent a sca-1+/cd31- subpopulation.

gene expression profile of sca-1+-enriched cells
to further characterize gene expression in the long-term cultured sca-1+-enriched cells, gene expression profiles of p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> were generated by rt-pcr. two pluripotent stem cell specific genes, nanog and telomerase reverse transcriptase   <cit> , were both expressed; tert is usually not detectable in cardiac fibroblasts  <cit> . islet- <dig> , a marker of the secondary heart field  <cit> , and tbx <dig>  a marker of the primary heart field  <cit>  were both detected, though the expression level of tbx <dig> was weaker than that of isl- <dig>  the cardiac-specific transcription factors gata- <dig>  nkx- <dig> , and mef2c were all expressed in three different passages. in contrast, the mature cardiomyocyte structural gene cardiac α-myosin heavy chain   <cit>  was undetectable . these results indicate that the long-term cultured cardiac-derived sca-1+-enriched cells show cardiac-specific features, but are not mature cardiomyocytes or cardiac fibroblasts.

in vitro proliferation capacity and tumorigenicity in vivo
the ability to proliferate is a significant feature of stem cells and progenitor cells. the proliferative abilities of p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> cells were indirectly assessed by measuring the od value of the supernatant incubated with cck- <dig>  five sequential time points were chosen for testing: days  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  at day  <dig> of each passage, the od value was generally low and there was no statistical difference among these three passages. but from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  it sharply increased. after day <dig>  the od value continued increasing slowly, peaked at day  <dig>  then plateaued at this level for several days . there was no statistical difference in proliferation between p <dig> and p <dig>  however, the od value at day  <dig>  day  <dig>  day  <dig>  and day  <dig> of p <dig> was significantly higher than that of p <dig> and p <dig>  and in all the comparisons between two adjacent time points in each passage, only day  <dig> and day  <dig> presented statistical difference . these data indicate that the proliferative ability has increased during long term culture, and the significant time point is day  <dig> 

to exclude that sca-1+ cells were spontaneously transforming into tumorigenic cells, cells from p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> were injected subcutaneously into scid mice. equivalent mouse r <dig> es cells were injected contralaterally as a positive control. no tumors developed at the site of implantation of p <dig>  p <dig>  or p <dig> cells over approximately 3 months. in contrast, sites injected with r <dig> es cells all developed neoplasms about 3 weeks after injection; 3 months later, these tumors were nearly 20 mm in diameter. the tumorigenic rates are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

multipotent differentiation of mouse heart-derived sca-1+ cells into cardiac cell lineages
to estimate the differentiation potential of cells into the cardiomyocyte, smooth muscle, and endothelial lineages, p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> cells were cultured in specific differentiation medium, with simultaneously cultured in differentiation medium without growth factors serving as controls. when induction was completed, lineage-specific markers were analyzed by if staining and rt-pcr.

after 2 weeks of induction to a cardiomyocyte fate, cmhc-positive and ctnt-positive cells were detected in all three passages, and no cmhc- or ctnt-positive cells were observed in control groups . though the differentiation potential in quantitative analysis of these three passages didn’t present statistical difference among them, it was still low in each passage . this cardiomyogenic potential was confirmed by their gene expression profiles. mature cardiomyocyte marker genes, including cardiac α-myosin heavy chain , cardiac β-myosin heavy chain , myosin light chain-2a  and myosin light chain-2v  were expressed in induced cells. in contrast, these genes were not expressed in control groups. after differentiation, the cardiac-specific transcription factor gata <dig> was downregulated, while nkx <dig>  and mef2c were upregulated .

after 10 days of induction to a smooth muscle cell fate, sma-positive and smhc-positive cells were detected and the number of calponin-positive cells increased significantly compared to the control groups . and the differentiation potential in quantitative analysis of these three passages didn’t present statistical differences among them . this result was further verified by examining the gene expression of sma and calponin. sma was expressed in all induced passages and there was no expression in control groups, while the expression of calponin was upregulated after induction .

after 2 weeks of induction to an endothelial fate, cd31-positive cells were detected in all passages, while none were detected in control groups . and the differentiation efficiency of these three passages didn’t present statistical differences among them . there was expression of the endothelial specific genes cd <dig>  ve-cadherin, and vwf in all the induced populations, and none in the control groups. the expression level of the endothelial progenitor cell marker flk- <dig> did not detectably change after differentiation . overall, these data indicate that mouse heart-derived sca-1+ cells are multipotent, retaining an ability to differentiate into different cardiac cell lineages, despite long-term propagation in vitro.

discussion
in this article, we successfully isolate sca-1+ cells from postnatal mice hearts with the macs system, using a microbead-labeled anti-sca- <dig> antibody. the isolated sca-1+ cells express the stemness markers nanog and tert, the cardiac mesoderm markers isl- <dig>  tbx <dig>  and the cardiac specific transcription factors gata <dig>  nkx <dig> , and mef2c. they can be propagated in vitro for a long time without any significant changes in marker expression. moreover, the isolated sca-1+ cells and their long-term descendants exhibit multipotent differentiation to cardiac cell lineages, including smooth muscle, endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. so, the sca-1+ cells we isolated from mouse heart tissue should be identified as cpcs.

isolation of a cardiac progenitor cell  population from the heart is challenging, particularly because of a lack of specific surface markers. though sca-1+ cells, c-kit+ cells, isl-1+ cells, wt1+ cells, sp cells and cdcs have been extracted from postnatal cardiac tissue  <cit> , it remains to be determined whether these individual cpc populations represent different intermediate stages of a single cell lineage or are independent cell lineages originating from different precursors. some cell markers that could distinguish different lineages, such as isl- <dig> and wt- <dig>  are transcription factors, and therefore, transgenic animals would be necessary to genetically tag these proteins to use them as tools to isolate live cells  <cit> . whether cdcs possess cardiomyogenic potential remains controversial  <cit> . although c-kit+ cardiac stem cells were the first stem cells identified in the rat heart  <cit> , recent studies have suggested that sca-1+ progenitor cells are actually the predominant stem cell population there  <cit> : sca-1+ cells are 100– <dig> fold more frequent than c-kit+ cells  <cit> . although the biological hierarchy and correlation between cardiac sp cells and sca1+ cells is still unclear, interestingly, a high percentage  of cardiac sp cells express the sca <dig> antigen and only a very small percentage  of cardiac sca-1+ cells is included in the sp fraction  <cit> . furthermore, cardiac sp cells typically lack c-kit, in contrast to marrow sp cells  <cit> . for these reasons, sca-1+ cells in cardiac tissue may be the most populous cpcs or predominate over the long-term, and thus may be relatively easy to isolate from cardiac tissue. this is why we aimed to isolate sca-1+ cpcs from the mouse heart in our research. in 3- to 4-week-old mice, sca-1+ cells accounted for approximately  <dig> % of total cardiac cells , in line with the previously reported  <dig> %  <cit>  and  <dig> %  <cit>  of sca-1+ cells in 8-week-old and 6- to 12- week-old mice heart respectively; there is a clear negative correlation between csc number and age  <cit> .

here, sca-1+ cardiac cells, including early, middle and late passages, showed limited expression of the common stemness marker c-kit and the hematopoietic lineage markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  which characterize bone marrow-derived stem cells  <cit> . moreover, they also showed limited expression of the endothelial lineage markers flk- <dig> and cd <dig>  however, during early stages of in vitro culture, such as p <dig>  the expression of cd <dig> in enriched cells is somewhat higher than found in previous studies  <cit> . we ascribe this outcome to only one round of magnetic sorting. since cd <dig> has been characterized as a marker of progenitor cells in several lineages, it may represent another subpopulation of cpc or yet another lineage. based on fcm and if staining , these cardiac progenitor cells belonged to a sca-1+/cd31- subpopulation, which has been reported to show functional cardiomyogenic differentiation  <cit> . sca-1+/cd31- cpcs may be promising starting material to produce cells for cardiac regeneration. however, little is known about these cells’ stemness characteristics or differentiation potential after long-term culture in vitro. these features will determine whether it is possible to obtain sufficient seed cells from these rare primary cells. here, we monitor these features in cultured cpcs, propagating sca-1+/cd31- cpcs over  <dig> passages. if calculated from one primary isolated cell, with a splitting ratio of 1: <dig>  there would be approximately 2 ×  <dig> cells at p <dig> and approximately 2 ×  <dig> cells at p <dig>  these quantities would be sufficient to meet the requirements of cardiac tissue engineering.

stemness characteristics include specific marker expression, proliferation ability, and differentiation potential. in gene expression profile analysis, sca-1+ cardiac cells were positive for the cardiac mesoderm precursor markers isl- <dig> and tbx <dig>  and cardiac-specific transcription factors nkx <dig>  and gata <dig>  but negative for the cardiomyocyte structure gene α-mhc . isl- <dig> is a marker of cardiac precursors in the developing as well as postnatal heart  <cit> , and also is a marker of cells in the secondary heart field. isl-1+ cells are considered to be cardiovascular precursors with the ability to differentiate into the three main cardiac cell lineages  <cit> . in contrast, tbx <dig> is expressed in the primary heart field  <cit> . proliferation ability is another important stemness characteristic. here, sca-1+ cpcs in early, middle and late passages proliferated rapidly during days 1– <dig> after seeding, with continuous growth that peaked at day  <dig>  these results are consistent with previous reports  <cit> . there were significant differences in proliferation ability between p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> during the period of rapid proliferation . p <dig> showed the greatest proliferation ability of the three. tateishi and colleagues have reported that knockdown of sca- <dig> transcripts in cpcs, by inactivating akt, leads to retarded ex vivo expansion and apoptosis. that is, sca- <dig> signaling might be essential to promote cpc proliferation and survival  <cit> . in this study, the purity of sca-1+ cells was highest at p <dig>  which may have contributed to their greater proliferation ability. to test whether cells became tumorigenic over long-term culture, sca-1+ cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice: in over more than 3 months of observation, no neoplasms appeared.

we tested the differentiation potential of sca-1+/cd31- cells in early, middle, and late stages of culture. after differentiation, sca-1+ cells presented specific marker expression patterns of multiple cardiac cell lineages, such as smhc, sma and calponin for smooth muscle, cd <dig>  vwf and ve-cadherin for endothelial cells, and ctnt, cmhc and mlc for cardiomyocytes . there were no significant differences between early, middle and late passages in differentiation potential. this study nevertheless has some limitations. although the cells did present cardiomyogenic differentiation potential, the frequency of cardiomyogenic differentiation was lower than expected. though 5-azacytidine is a classic agent to induce bone marrow-derived cells to efficiently differentiate into cardiomyocytes, it appears less effective in the sca-1+ cpc population  <cit> . previous research has shown that cardiomyogenic differentiation of sca-1+ cpcs induced by dexamethasone, dimethylsulfoxide, 5-azacytidine, oxytocine, tgf-β, wnt <dig>  wnt5a, bmp <dig>  and fgf <dig>  individually or in combinations, failed to generate mature, beating cardiomyocytes. only stimulation with bmp <dig> combined with fgf- <dig> has been shown to induce the expression of mature cardiac markers  <cit> . therefore, we also utilized bmp <dig> combined with fgf- <dig> to induce sca-1+ cpcs for cardiomyogenic differentiation in our research. regardless of a failure to generate beating cardiomyocytes, the ratio of cardiomyogenic marker expression was still low . further studies are required to identify efficient inducing factors. the function of differentiated cells from those sca-1+/cd31- progenitor cells should also be investigated in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated postnatal mouse heart-derived sca-1+/cd31- cpcs by macs, which can be propagated in vitro over the long-term while retaining stemness characteristics and multiple differentiation potentials. this research may present a possibility that in future clinical studies on cardiac regeneration we can provide a sufficient source of seed cells from little human heart tissue.
