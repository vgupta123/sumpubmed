BACKGROUND
foot-and-mouth disease virus  is the etiological agent of foot-and-mouth disease  that infects cloven-hoofed animals such as pigs, sheep and cattle and causes serious damage in the livestock industry  <cit> . although conventional vaccines based on the chemically inactivated virus are effective against fmdv  <cit> , outbreaks of fmd sometimes result from virus escaping from vaccine production units or from the use of improperly inactivated virus  <cit> . alternative approaches to produce an effective and safe fmd vaccine are needed to replace inactivated virus-based vaccines.

fmdv particles are composed of  <dig> copies of each of four capsid proteins termed vp <dig>  vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig>  which are cleavage products of the capsid precursor polypeptide p <dig> <cit> . vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> form the outer capsid shell, whereas vp <dig> lines the interior surface  <cit> . among these capsid proteins, vp <dig> contains the major antigenic domains of the virus  <cit> , with its g-h loop including at its apex a highly conserved arg-gly-asp  tripeptide, which can bind to integrins and facilitate the internalization of fmdv into target cells  <cit> . therefore, many investigators have used vp <dig> as a candidate vaccine against fmdv  <cit> .

chimeric plant virus-derived vaccines against fmd have been described and used in experimental or natural hosts  <cit> . cowpea mosaic virus  expressing vp <dig> epitopes on the surface of the virus was first reported to react with fmdv-specific antiserum  <cit> . tobacco mosaic virus  expressing the full vp <dig> protein or an epitope of vp <dig> was subsequently shown to induce protective immunity against fmdv in both mice and swine  <cit> . although preliminary protection against fmdv in swine was demonstrated with tmv expressing the vp <dig> epitope  <cit> , effort is needed to improve not only the replication efficiency and stability of such chimeric viruses but also the immune responses they induce  <cit> .

recently, potato virus x , a member of the potexvirus genus, was reported to be an effective epitope presentation system for chimeric virus particle production  <cit> . analysis by fiber diffraction pattern has shown that the surface features of pvx are more flexible than those of tmv  <cit> , which likely contributes significantly to the accommodation of foreign peptides on the surface of the virus. bamboo mosaic virus  is also a flexuous rod-shaped member of the potexvirus genus. it infects both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants  <cit> . the viral genome of bamv consists of a single-stranded positive-sense rna molecule with a 5' cap structure and 3' poly tail that contains five major open reading frames  encoding different target proteins for viral replication, movement and assembly  <cit> . the orf <dig> encodes a coat protein  for virus encapsidation, cell-to-cell and long-distance movement  <cit> .

here we describe generation of a recombinant bamv-based vector, namely pbvp <dig>  by replacing complementary dna  encoding  <dig> amino acid residues from the n-terminal sequence of bamv cp with cdna encoding  <dig> amino acid residues  of fmdv  vp <dig>  we examined the ability of this recombinant viral vector to generate a chimeric bamv virus in plants and the effectiveness of the chimeric virus to induce immune responses and protection of swine against fmdv challenge.

methods
construction of an recombinant infectious pbvp <dig> vector
the full-length infectious cdna of bamv-s with an upstream cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter sequence was cloned in the plasmid puc <dig>  as described previously  <cit> . a vector pbs-d35cp was derived from the aforementioned pbamv-s plasmid by deletion of the n-terminal  <dig> amino acid sequence of cp and insertion of multiple cloning sites  by pcr . a sequence corresponding to amino acids 128– <dig> of vp <dig> of fmdv serotype o/taiwan/ <dig> was inserted into pbs-d35cp by pcr with the plasmid pvp1/q <dig> used as a template  <cit> . the primers used were pr128164n  and pr128164c . pcr was carried out at an initial temperature of 94°c for  <dig> min followed by  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, 50°c for  <dig> s and an extension at 72°c for  <dig> s. the amplified fragment encoding vp <dig> peptide was purified, sequenced and cloned into plasmid pbs-d35cp at the nhei and noti sites. the sequence of the new plasmid was confirmed and denoted as pbvp <dig> .

virus propagation and purification
plants of the local lesion host chenopodium quinoa  and systemic host nicotiana benthamiana  were grown in a greenhouse exposed to normal daylight. for the infectivity assay, approximately  <dig> μg of purified viral dna plasmids in  <dig> μl of double-distilled h2o was used to inoculate each leaf of test plants at the 6-leaf stage  <cit> . observations for local lesions took place  <dig> days post-inoculation. for antigen preparation,  <dig> to  <dig> fully expanded leaves of c. quinoa plants that had been inoculated with pbamv-s or pbvp <dig> were harvested at  <dig> days post-inoculation. the virions were subsequently purified from the leaves and the yield was determined by ultraviolet absorption as described previously  <cit> . the amount of vp <dig> epitope expressed in the chimeric virus bvp <dig> was estimated at about  <dig> % of the total viral coat proteins. purified virions were dissolved in be buffer , then stored at -20°c for subsequent immunization of swine.

western blotting analysis and immunogold labeling of virus particles
rabbit anti-fmdv vp <dig> serum was prepared as described previously  <cit> . total proteins were prepared from mock or viral dna plasmid-inoculated c. quinoa with use of 1: <dig>  extraction buffer  and heated at 100°c for  <dig> min. protein samples were separated by 12% sds-page and electrophoretically transferred to immobilon-p membranes  with  <dig> ma for  <dig> h at 4°c. after blocking, the proteins on the membranes were probed with anti-bamv-s cp or anti-fmdv vp <dig> antibodies or serum from fmdv-infected swine and then processed as described previously  <cit> .

for immunogold labeling of virus particles, the pbamv-s or pbvp1-inoculated leaves of c. quinoa were harvested at  <dig> days post-inoculation and the labeling procedures were conducted as described previously  <cit> . briefly, grids were first floated on leaf extract for  <dig> min followed by diluted 1: <dig> anti-bamv-s cp or anti-fmdv vp <dig> antibodies and then decorated by gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit igg complexes. the grids were then stained with 2% uranyl acetate and examined under a philips cm <dig> electron microscope.

analysis of the purity of bvp <dig> virions on sds-page
the recombinant virus bvp <dig> was purified from infected leaves and electrophoresed on a  <dig> % polyacrylamide gel containing 1% sds. the gel was stained with plusone silver staining kit .

immunization and viral challenge in swine
specific pathogen-free female or castrated male swine  were obtained in taiwan. in experiment  <dig>  two groups of three pigs each were immunized respectively by intramuscular injection into the neck muscles beside the ears with  <dig> mg and  <dig> mg of bvp <dig> virions emulsified with montanide isa  <dig>  at a 1: <dig> ratio . in addition, two pigs were immunized with wild-type virus bamv-s emulsified with montanide isa  <dig> and another two with sterile pbs buffer as negative control groups. all animals boosted with the same amount six weeks later. sera were collected for analysis from the immunized animals at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  four weeks after boost, all swine were challenged with  <dig>  ml of  <dig>  tcid <dig> of fmdv o/taiwan/ <dig> by subcutaneous injection into the right front heel bulb. the swine were monitored daily for fmd symptoms for  <dig> days. signs of fmd symptoms included elevated body temperature above 40°c for  <dig> successive days, lameness, vesicular lesions on the snout, and coronary bands on the legs  <cit> . in experiment  <dig>  three groups of three swine each were vaccinated with  <dig> mg,  <dig> mg, and  <dig>  mg bvp <dig> respectively and boosted at day  <dig> according to the same regimen. as negative controls, two pigs were immunized with wild-type virus bamv-s and another two with sterile pbs buffer. seven days after boost , swine were injected with  <dig>  ml of  <dig>  tcid <dig> of fmdv  as in experiment  <dig>  the viral challenge experiments were carried out in high containment facilities.

fmdv preparation for swine challenge
the fmdv used in challenge experiments was produced from a homogenized mixture of vesicular fluid and epithelium of a pig infected with fmdv o/taiwan/ <dig>  the titer of the virus was titrated in bhk- <dig> cells in accordance with fmd world reference laboratory, pirbright, uk.

elisa for serum titer analysis
elisa was performed as described previously with minor modifications  <cit> . in brief, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with recombinant vp <dig> protein  in  <dig>  m carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, ph  <dig> , overnight at 4°c. plates were blocked with 5% skim milk in pbs and washed three times with pbs containing  <dig> % tween- <dig> . samples of 1: <dig> diluted serum in serial dilution were added to wells  and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c. after three washings, a 1:  <dig> diluted biotinylated goat anti-swine igg antibody was added for  <dig> h at 37°c. the plates were subsequently washed, and streptavidin:peroxidase  was added. after incubation for  <dig> h at room temperature, the plates were washed again in pbst. enzyme substrate  <dig>  3',  <dig>  5'-tetramethylbenzidine  was then added, and the colorigenic reaction was carried out at room temperature for  <dig> min. finally, an equal volume of  <dig> n h2so <dig> was added to stop the reaction, and the absorbance at  <dig> nm was measured by an elisa reader. the titer was defined as the reciprocal of the dilution that resulted in an absorbance value 50% of total value obtained from subtracting maximum absorbance with background absorbance. the maximum absorbance is the absorbance at the plateau  of the curve obtained by plotting the optical density versus serial dilution of sera of immunized swine in a semi-logarithmical manner.

assay for anti-fmdv nas
the anti-fmdv nas assays were carried out in  <dig> wells flat-bottomed plates using bhk- <dig> cells as described in the oie manual  <cit> . in brief, sera from test animals were inactivated at 56°c for  <dig> min. two-fold serial dilution of sera were performed in duplicate and  <dig> μl of each were added to the wells. fifty μl of  <dig> tcid <dig> of fmdv  was then added to each well. the plate was vortexed for  <dig> min and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min. bhk- <dig> cell suspension  in emem containing 5% fetal bovine serum was subsequently added to each well and incubated for  <dig> h. the cells were then observed under a microscope for the cytopathic effect  of the virus as indicated by disruption of cell monolayer and change of shape from spindle to round. titers were expressed as the final dilution of serum present in the serum/virus mixture where 50% of wells are protected.

preparation of total rna
peripheral blood mononuclear cells  isolated from test swine were seeded in triplicate in 6-well culture plates at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well in  <dig> ml of dmem culture medium supplemented with 10% fbs and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. after overnight culture, cells were incubated with  <dig> μg/ml recombinant vp <dig> , prepared as described previously  <cit> , or  <dig> μg/ml of phytohaemagglutinin  for  <dig> h at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  cells stimulated with pha were used as positive controls. following the incubation, cells were lysed in trizol™ reagent , and total cellular rna was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. the concentration of total cellular rna was quantified by determination of optical density at  <dig> nm. total cellular rna was reverse transcribed into cdna by superscript iii™ reverse transcriptase . the resulting cdna was amplified by real-time pcr.

measurement of ifn-γ production by real-time pcr
total ifn-γ mrna was measured by real-time pcr by use of a sybr green system in a lightcycler instrument . samples were assayed in a final volume of  <dig> μl with use of the faststart dna master sybr green i kit , including heat-activatable taq polymerase, plus  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  each primer , 5'-gctctgggaaactgaatgacttcg; and sw-ifn-γ , 5'- gacttctcttccgctttcttaggttag) at  <dig>  μm and  <dig> μl of cdna was prepared as described above. following polymerase activation ,  <dig> cycles were run with a  <dig> s denaturation at 95°c,  <dig> s annealing at 60°c, and  <dig> s extension at 72°c. the temperature transition rate was 20°c/s for all steps. the amount of pcr product was measured once every cycle immediately after the 72°c incubation  by detection of the fluorescence associated with the binding of sybr green i to the amplification product. fluorescence curves were analyzed with use of lightcycler software, version  <dig>  . the primers were synthesized by invitrogen life technologies. for each sample, the amount of ifn-γ was determined by comparing with a standard curve and normalized by using β-actin as the internal reference. all samples were processed in triplicate.

detection of antibodies against the non-structural protein of fmdv
infected animals produce antibodies to both the structural and non-structural proteins of fmdv. therefore, the presence of antibodies against only structural but not non-structural proteins can differentiate vaccinated animals from infected ones  <cit> . the occurrence of fmdv infection in swine was determined by measuring elicitation of antibodies against non-structural 3abc proteins. sera from all groups of swine were collected  <dig> and  <dig> days post challenge. the presence of antibodies against the non-structural protein 3abc of fmdv in sera were measured with use of the ceditest®fmdv-ns strip elisa kit   <cit>  according to the manufacturer's instructions.

RESULTS
characterization of a recombinant infectious pbvp <dig> vector
to use a bamv-based vector to express vp <dig> epitopes of fmdv, we first constructed a modified bamv vector, pbs-d35cp, derived from a pbamv-s vector  by deleting  <dig> amino acids from the n-terminal cp and inserting multiple cloning sites . a cdna sequence corresponding to the fmdv  vp <dig> 128– <dig> amino acids was then cloned into the cp truncated region of pbs-d35cp to generate the pbvp <dig> vector . we revealed the infectivity of the recombinant viral vector in both the systemic host n. benthamiana and the local lesion host c. quinoa. in n. benthamiana, infection with pbvp <dig> produced milder mosaic symptoms than that with pbamv-s, the full-length infectious cdna of wild-type bamv. in c. quinoa, chlorotic local lesions formed after pbvp <dig> inoculation were also distinct from those caused by pbamv-s.

detection of vp <dig> epitopes in plants infected with pbvp1
we then determined whether pbvp <dig> could infect target plants to generate bamv cp containing vp <dig> epitopes of fmdv. total protein samples taken from c. quinoa leaves inoculated with distilled water , pbamv-s, pbs-d35cp or pbvp <dig> were respectively subjected to sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and western blotting analysis with use of anti-bamv-s cp antibodies . as anticipated, protein extract of mock-inoculated leaves showed no bamv cp . the n-terminal truncated cp , detected in the protein extract of pbs-d35cp-inoculated plants, migrated faster than the wild-type cp of pbamv-s-infected plants , which in turns migrated slightly faster than the chimeric cp from pbvp <dig> inoculated plants . these results indicate an apparent size difference between the cp generated from pbvp <dig> and those from pbamv-s and pbs-d35cp.

to further verify that cp generated from pbvp1-inoculated plants contained the vp <dig> antigenic epitopes of fmdv, western blotting analysis with use of rabbit serum against fmdv vp <dig>  or serum from fmdv-infected swine  was undertaken. both sera recognized a protein band of  <dig> kda corresponding to the chimeric cp . in contrast, no protein band was detected in the wild-type cp of bamv-s  or truncated cp of bs-d35cp . additional immunoblotting studies with the same antibodies in c. quinoa showed that even after five subsequent passages, protein extracts of pbvp1-inoculated leaves still contained a major protein band with similar mobility to chimeric cp . taken together, these results suggest that the inoculation of plants with pbvp <dig> plasmid generates a fusion protein comprised of truncated cp of bamv and the vp <dig> epitopes of fmdv.

expression of fmdv vp <dig> epitopes on bvp <dig> virus particles
to further confirm that the fmdv vp <dig> epitopes was expressed on the viral surface, the chimeric virus, namely bvp <dig>  was isolated from pbvp1-infected c. quinoa leaf tissue. the yield of the purified virus was estimated to be around  <dig> – <dig>  mg per gram of fresh leaf tissue. the purified bvp <dig> virus was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and silver staining. as shown in fig.  <dig>  small amounts of virus samples  showed only single major band. when larger amount of virions  was loaded, the majority of proteins migrated as  <dig> kd of chimeric cp while several low molecular weight bands of degraded cp were detected. the presence of the fmdv vp <dig> peptide on the virus surface was subsequently determined by using anti-bamv cp or anti-fmdv vp <dig> antibodies, and the formation of the antibody-antigen complexes was detected with use of gold-labeled secondary antibodies and immunoelectron microscopy. we found that chimeric bvp <dig> virions were specifically labeled with anti-bamv cp and anti-fmdv vp <dig> respectively . in contrast, bamv-s virions were merely labeled with anti-bamv cp serum  but not with anti-fmdv vp <dig> . by negatively staining, no difference in morphology could be observed between wild type bamv and chimeric virus bvp <dig>  these data indicate that the fmdv vp <dig> peptide is fused to bamv cp and expressed on the viral surface.

antibody responses elicited by chimeric virus bvp <dig> in swine
we then evaluated the ability of this chimeric virus to trigger immunity against fmdv in swine. in our first experiment, two groups of three pigs each were given intramuscular injections of  <dig> mg and  <dig> mg of bvp <dig> chimeric virus respectively and boosted with similar amount of bvp <dig>  <dig> weeks later. another two groups of two pigs each were vaccinated with  <dig> mg bamv-s wild-type virus or pbs buffer respectively as negative controls. sera obtained from both  <dig> mg and  <dig> mg bvp1-immunized swine elicited high levels of anti-vp <dig> antibodies, as measured by elisa. in contrast, swine immunized with bamv-s or pbs buffer all showed little, if any, anti-vp <dig> antibodies . furthermore, neutralizing antibodies  were detected in the sera of the bvp1-vaccinated groups but not in those of the negative control groups . to confirm that even smaller amounts of bvp <dig> could exhibit similar effects, we immunized swine with either  <dig>  mg or  <dig> mg of bvp <dig> and boosted with similar amounts of bvp <dig>  <dig> weeks later. substantial titers of anti-vp <dig> antibodies  and nas  were detected even in the sera of swine given one inoculation of  <dig>  mg bvp <dig>  indicating that the chimeric bvp <dig> virus can effectively trigger specific nas in swine.

a the titer of nas from each swine was measured at indicated weeks as described in methods.  means that no nas were detected at the highest concentration tested.

ifn-γ production in immunized swine
to evaluate whether bvp1-immunized swine could induce a cell-mediated immune response in addition to nas , we analyzed the ability of pbmcs to produce ifn-γ, a cytokine that plays an important role in cell-mediated immune responses. real-time pcr analysis of specific ifn-γ mrna showed that upon vp <dig> antigen stimulation, pbmcs from bvp1-immunized swine induced production of ifn-γ whereas bamv-s or pbs-immunized swine did not . as control, pbmcs from all groups of swine were stimulated with t-cell mitogen pha  and found to produce similar amounts of ifn-γ .

a pbmcs isolated from swine  <dig> weeks after priming were stimulated with  <dig> μg/ml of rvp <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml of pha for  <dig> h at 37°c. total cellular rna was then extracted for the assay of ifn-γ production by real-time pcr. the fold change was determined by dividing the quantity of specific ifn-γ mrna from stimulated cells by the quantity of ifn-γ mrna from the unstimulated cells.

b swine of all groups were challenged with fmdv  and monitored daily for clinical symptoms of fmd for  <dig> days as described in methods.

protection against fmdv challenge in immunized swine
we then determined whether bvp <dig> could confer immunoprotection in swine. all groups of swine were challenged with  <dig>  tcid <dig>  of fmdv  and monitored for the appearance of fmd symptoms for two weeks. at days 2– <dig> after challenge, the negative control groups showed serious symptoms of fmd. in contrast, all swine immunized with bvp <dig> showed no fmd symptoms after challenge. in addition, since infected animals produce antibodies to both the structural and non-structural proteins of fmdv, the presence of antibodies against only structural but not non-structural proteins can differentiate vaccinated animals from infected ones  <cit> . we thus examined the presence of fmdv in sera of all animals 8– <dig> days after fmdv challenge by measuring antibodies against non-structural protein 3abc. all the groups immunized with bvp <dig> did not develop an antibody response to 3abc while control groups became 3abc positive .

a the presence of antibodies against 3abc of fmdv were measured  <dig> and  <dig> days post challenge, respectively.  indicates the presence of antibodies against 3abc protein.  indicates no antibodies against the 3abc protein.

discussion
although use of cpmv and tmv as a vector to generate chimeric plant virus-derived vaccines against fmd has been described  <cit> , effort is needed to improve not only the stability of such chimeric viruses but also the immune responses and protection they induce in the target animals  <cit> . recently developed was a modified tmv-based vector that allows for the expression of peptides as long as  <dig> amino acids. such chimeric constructs, however, are not as effective as the tmv expressing the  <dig> amino acid epitope in generating protective immunity  <cit> . in this study, we infected plants with plasmid pbvp <dig> to generate a chimeric virion  expressing a  <dig> amino acid peptide of vp <dig> and elicited strong immunity in swine even after just one inoculation . the bamv-based expression system therefore may be better than the tmv system in expressing peptides up to  <dig> amino acids or longer. however, as different transgenes were used in bamv, cpmv and tmv, it is difficult to judge at present whether chimeric bamv is better than chimeric cpmv and tmv in terms of their elicitation of immune responses.

the prominent g-h loop of the capsid protein vp <dig> of fmdv, including at its apex a highly conserved arg-gly-asp  tripeptide, has been identified as a major b-cell epitope for eliciting nas  <cit> . however, administering g-h loop synthetic peptides alone in cattle and swine has resulted in limited induction of nas or ineffective protection  <cit> . piatti and others  <cit>  showed induction of both t-cell immunity and high na response positively correlated with effective protection in experimental animals immunized with inactivated fmdv. parida and coauthors  <cit>  have thus suggested that evaluation of effective protection of fmd vaccine should combine the presence of nas and ifn-γ production . because the vp <dig> sequence  of fmdv o <dig> campos contains not only the g-h loop, the major b-cell epitope, but also the immunodominant t epitopes  <cit> , in this study, we introduced residues 128– <dig>  which includes t and b epitopes, of the vp <dig> sequence into the bamv-based vector. swine immunized with bvp <dig> elicited vp1-specific ifn-γ and high titers of na against fmdv . to our knowledge, this is the first report of a chimeric plant virus correctly expressing vp <dig> epitope to properly induce both humoral  and cell-mediated immune responses .

most importantly, our results have clearly demonstrated that bvp <dig> immunization can protect swine against a challenge of  <dig>  tcid <dig> fmdv, an amount  <dig> times higher than that recommended by the world organization for animal health  <cit> . in addition, we have recently examined whether one inoculation is sufficient to protect the animals. our preliminary results revealed that swine immunized once with  <dig> mg bvp <dig> were protected from fmdv challenge. we thus propose that bvp <dig> may be superior to other plant viruses such as tmv in presenting the vp <dig> peptide so that the immunogenic site of the peptide mimic the conformation of the major antigenic epitope of fmdv, thereby generating high titers of nas as well as cellular immune responses. more studies involving the incorporation of the similar transgene into tmv and evaluation of the optimal dosage for protection, however, must be undertaken to confirm this proposal. of note, an important advantage of the bamv-based vector over cpmv, tmv and most other plant virus-based vectors is that bamv is not a pathogen for a variety of crops and therefore may be ecologically safer for field use  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have inserted a transgene encoding a partial sequence of the capsid vp <dig> of fmdv in the plant virus bamv. the recombinant plasmid could infect host plants to generate chimeric virions that elicit significant na titers in the animals even after just one inoculation. the capability of this bamv-based vector to carry larger transgenes, effectively express foreign peptide epitope and induce protective humoral and cellular immune responses would be advantageous for its application in the development of vaccines against not only fmdv but also many other pathogens.
