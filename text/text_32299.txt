BACKGROUND
angiostrongylus cantonensis was first discovered in the pulmonary arteries and hearts of domestic rats in guangzhou , china, by chen in  <dig>  <cit> . this metastrongyloid nematode is now well recognized as the primary cause of human eosinophilic meningoencephalitis  in many parts of the indo-pacific region  <cit> . rats, the permissive or definitive host, acquire this nematode by ingesting the third-stage  larvae. humans, as accidental hosts, become infected by eating raw or improperly cooked freshwater snails, the intermediate host of this nematode, or paratenic hosts such as monitor lizards  <cit> , shrimp  <cit> , frogs  <cit> , fish and slugs  <cit> . the parasite larvae ultimately reach the central nervous system  or occasionally migrate to the eye chamber. the three main clinical manifestations of human angiostrongyliasis are eosinophilic meningitis , eosinophilic encephalitis  and ocular angiostrongyliasis  <cit> .

nomura and lin reported the first human infection with a. cantonensis in taiwan in  <dig>  following that, cases were reported in many countries and regions, primarily australia  <cit> , the southwestern pacific  <cit> , southern and southeast asia, africa  <cit> , the caribbean  <cit>  and southeastern usa  <cit> . reports of all forms of human angiostrongyliasis are increasing due to frequent international travel  <cit> . the first human case in mainland china was reported in  <dig>  and only four cases were reported between  <dig> and  <dig>  however, more than  <dig> cases of human angiostrongyliasis were documented from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . a large outbreak involving  <dig> patients occurred in  <dig> in beijing, in northern china  <cit> . another outbreak involving  <dig> confirmed cases occurred in  <dig> in yunnan province in southwestern china. moreover, owing to the past and projected effects of global climate change  <cit> , there are vast habitats worldwide, including mainland china, with environmental conditions potentially suitable for intermediate hosts of a. cantonensis  <cit> . human angiostrongyliasis is becoming a new public health problem in mainland china; however, clinicians remain unfamiliar with the disease.

there has been much investigation into the serological diagnosis  <cit>  and treatment  <cit>  of human angiostrongyliasis in past decades, but molecular characterization of the causative agent of angiostrongyliasis, a. cantonensis, has received less attention. a. cantonensis, has only  <dig> documented gene sequences, including sequences for  <dig> transposons  <cit> ,  <dig> noncoding rna genes  <cit> , and  <dig> protein-coding genes  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  est sequences have also been documented. in  <dig>  peng h.j. submitted  <dig> adult worm ests . and in  <dig>  tang, p. and wang, l.c. submitted  <dig>  est sequences from fifth stage larvae obtained from the brains of laboratory-infected sprague dawley rats . the biology of this nematode is still far from clear. furthermore, despite the fact that human angiostrongyliasis has become a new public health problem  <cit> , genomic or est sequencing of a. cantonensis are not included in international research plans for the foreseeable future. in this study, we cloned and analyzed full-length cdna sequences from this nematode, identifying  <dig> cdna clusters. by applying bioinformatic and immunogenicity analyses, we have improved our understanding of the basic biology of a. cantonensis.

RESULTS
comparative analysis of sequenced cdnas
as an initial step towards sequencing the transcriptome of this nematode, we constructed a full-length cdna library from the tissues of fourth-stage  larvae obtained from mouse brains. first, we sequenced an approximate 600-bp 5' terminal region from ~ <dig>  cdna clones. after excluding any repetitive dna, rdna and ambiguous sequences, about  <dig>  clones remained. these  <dig>  sequences were used to interrogate the public databases by blastx and were assigned to  <dig> cdna clusters. next, we selected a single clone from each cdna cluster and sequenced the complete input cdna fragment. of these  <dig> cdnas,  <dig>  and  <dig>  matched known genes at cutoff expectation values  of 10- <dig> and 10- <dig>  respectively . about 40% of cdnas showed little homology to known genes in the searched databases. in addition, a holistic comparative analysis was performed among these  <dig> cdna clusters and genetic resources for hosts of a. cantonensis and for caenorhabditis elegans. of these  <dig> sequences, at least  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were orthologous with human, mouse, rat and c. elegans, respectively .

prior to submitting our cdna sequences,  <dig>  est sequences from a. cantonensis had been deposited in the genbank database. of these,  <dig>  were from l <dig> larvae and  <dig> were from adult worms recovered from rats. we analyzed our  <dig> cdna clusters from l <dig> larvae recovered from mouse for correlations with these  <dig>  est sequences. we found that  <dig> of  <dig> cdna clusters covered  <dig> individual est sequences  of the  <dig>  est sequences from l <dig> larvae. especially, we found that  <dig> cdnas cluters of collagen family members had covered  <dig> ests, more than one third of above  <dig> individual est sequencess. and  <dig> cdna clusters covered  <dig> of  <dig> individual est sequences  from adult worms. in addition, four cdna clusters were common among l <dig> larvae, l <dig> larvae and adult worm cdna libraries, implying the constitutive expression profile. these four cdnas were transcripts of myosin light chain family member  <dig>  putative collagen protein  <dig>  putative stress-activated protein kinase jnk- <dig>  and heat shock protein family member  <dig> 

biological characterization of  <dig> full-length cdnas
among these  <dig> cdnas, only  <dig> were found to contain a complete open reading frame . these  <dig> full-length cdnas had an average length of  <dig>  bp. there were  <dig>  cdnas with 501- <dig>  bp,  <dig>  smaller than  <dig> bp, and  <dig>  larger than  <dig>  bp . the corresponding  <dig> proteins had an average length of  <dig> amino acids ; the 5'-untranslated regions  averaged  <dig> bp and 3'-utrs averaged  <dig> bp in length. the protein with the largest molecular weight was a putative "pap/25a-associated domain containing" protein consisting of  <dig> amino acids, whereas the smallest protein was a putative transcription factor  <dig> amino acids in length. an analysis of the 3'-utr length distribution of the  <dig> cdnas showed that  <dig> cdnas contained 3'-utrs shorter than  <dig> bp. in addition, approximately 45% of clones had 3'-utrs that were at least half the length of the corresponding cdna . although these cdnas contained an orf, some cdna sequences did not contain full 5'-utrs; thus, the length distribution of 5'-utr are not described here.

the copy numbers for each cdna cluster in this first set of clones were statistically analyzed by counting the redundant cdna copies in each cluster, yielding an average for the  <dig> cdna clusters of  <dig>  copies. of the  <dig> cdna clusters,  <dig>  were present in only a single copy , indicating a relatively low level of expression. interestingly, there were  <dig> copies of transcripts for collagen- <dig>  the largest number for any transcript in this first round of sequencing. such a relatively high level of transcript for a collagen protein family member is possibly related to the third or fourth molting of larvae after migrating into the mouse brain. such statistics about clone abundance of individual cdna clusters provide some important insights into the dominantly expressed genes of l <dig> larvae in the mouse brain.

excretory/secretory proteins and surface membrane proteins of parasitic helminths are known to be good candidates for the diagnosis of helminthosis. we thus attempted to identify cdnas that encode secretory signal peptides or transmembrane domains. the putative protein products of these  <dig> cdnas were screened using the analytical tools signalp and tmhmm. this analysis showed that  <dig>  of these proteins, including proteins such as putative collagen family members, putative proteases and putative lipid-binding proteins, contain a signal peptide or signal anchor . several proteins also contain one or more transmembrane domains . some proteins in this group, containing up to four or seven transmembrane domains, likely belong to membrane-bound receptor families involved in signal transduction.

cdna-encoded protein function and larval metabolism
to predict the function of cdna-encoded proteins, we independently classified the predicted translations of these cdnas into different functional categories based on gene ontology . of these  <dig> cdnas, only  <dig> were successfully assigned to the  <dig> main "molecular function" categories of go. most cdna clusters belonged to the categories "binding"  and "catalytic activity" , which are not mutually exclusive . the  <dig> cdnas predicted to have binding functions were further subcategorized into the primary terms "protein binding" and "atp binding", which accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, of the total. the  <dig> cdnas predicted to encode proteins with catalytic activity could be further defined by  <dig> terms. however, unlike the proteins with predicted binding function, there were few predominant subcategories for those predicted to possess catalytic activity. the term "gtpase activity" was the most common, but applied to only seven cdnas. the putative functions of the  <dig> cdna-encoded proteins were also analyzed based on the go "biological process" hierarchy . we found a number of cdnas that may be associated with larval development and/or positive regulation of growth. such a gene distribution might reflect the basic need for larval development from l <dig> to l <dig> and from l <dig> to l <dig> in the mouse brain.

the infectious third-stage larvae of a. cantonensis usually secrete proteolytic enzymes after infecting the host. the functions served by different protease families include degradation of host hemoglobin  <cit> , larval penetration and migration  <cit> , and immune evasion  <cit> . of the  <dig> functional terms identified under the category of "catalytic activity", more than 10% are proteases, including serine, cysteine and aspartic proteases . the copy number of cysteine and aspartic protease family members in this first set of clones ranged from  <dig> to more than  <dig> copies. the total number of cdna copies belonging to the aspartic protease family was approximately equal to that of the cysteine protease family, but was five times larger than the number of cdna copies corresponding to the serine protease family. however, none of the cdnas was found to be homologous to metalloproteases, one of the four main protease families. in addition to proteases, a. cantonensis expresses enzymes involved in different metabolic pathways . about  <dig> enzymes identified here were associated with protein metabolism and  <dig> were involved in energy metabolism. however, only two enzymes involved in glycolysis were found, namely fructose-bisphosphate aldolase  <dig>  and lactic acid dehydrogenase . in summary, the distribution of cdna-encoded functional domains in the first set of  <dig>  clones suggests that transcripts for enzymes involved in protein metabolism and energy metabolism are more predominant during larval development in the mouse brain than those related to the glycolytic pathway.

it is becoming clear that parasitic nematodes have evolved highly specialized mechanisms to modify the host tissue environment to their benefit. in this context, the lipid metabolic pathway could be particularly important because l <dig> and l <dig> larvae of a. cantonensis are surrounded by the luxuriant cephalin in the brain of host. in this study, eight of the enzyme-associated genes identified, including fatty acid desaturase and acid sphingomyelinase, are involved in lipid metabolism. in addition, other non-enzyme-associated genes related to lipid metabolism were also found, including putative fatty acid and retinol-binding protein , adipor-like receptor and lipid binding protein  family members. frbp may facilitate the uptake, transport and distribution of fatty acids and retinols to specific target tissues  <cit> . the adipor-like receptor mediates fatty-acid oxidation through activation of amp kinase and ppar-alpha  <cit> . such information could indicate that a. cantonensis obtains lipids from the host to synthesize sterols and fatty acids. in brief, the observed pattern of genes involved in protein metabolism, lipid metabolism and glycolysis may reflect the central nervous system habitat of this pathogen.

immune responses and diagnostic potential of recombinant protein candidates
to identify antigens that might be valuable for diagnosing human angiostrongyliasis, we selected several representative proteins from different cellular location for further study. four recombinant proteins were successfully purified in the initial attempt. these four proteins were cystatin , cathepsin d-like aspartic protease , intermediate filaments  and lactic acid dehydrogenase . conserved features of these four gene products were shown . these recombinantly expressed proteins were then used for immunogenicity analysis. immunoblotting results were analyzed using four groups of serum sample . the ability to recognize proven human angiostrongyliasis  was highest for crude somatic antigen and excretory/secretory  antigen , intermediate for cystatin and aspartic protease  and lowest for ifs and ldh . none could recognize all sera from clinically suspected angiostrongyliasis groups, although the es antigen was the most responsive. the corresponding specificities were  <dig> % and  <dig> % for crude somatic antigen and excretory/secretory  antigen, respectively, and 100% for cystatin, aspartic protease, ifs and ldh. no sera from the healthy control group or other parasitic diseases groups reacted with these four candidate proteins. in summary, the specificity of the two extracellular proteins was superior to that of the two intracellular proteins. in addition, the specificity of all four recombinant proteins was superior to that of crude somatic antigen and es antigen, but the opposite was true with respect to sensitivity.

immunogenicity and vaccine potential of recombinant protein candidates
to investigate the immunogenicity of candidate proteins, we first immunized mice in four experimental groups by subcutaneous injection with recombinant cystatin, aspartic protease, ifs or ldh, and then detected the igg level in the mouse by indirect elisa. we found that igg against the corresponding recombinant protein increased rapidly after day  <dig> and peaked on day  <dig> in all four experimental groups. a control group injected with pbs showed no such response. thus, all of these four recombinant proteins were capable of inducing an immune response in mice.

after immunizing mice with these recombinant proteins, we challenged experimental and control groups with l <dig> larvae, and evaluated mouse survival. by day  <dig> post-challenge, more than 50% of mice had died in the control group and in the experimental groups immunized with recombinant aspartic protease, ifs or ldh. however, 90% of mice survived in the experimental group immunized with cystatin. to confirm the vaccine potential of recombinant cystatin, we examined changes in worm burden in the brains of surviving mice by pathological analysis. we found that there was a significant difference in the average worm burden between the cystatin and control groups . in mice immunized with cystatin, the worm burden was reduced by  <dig> % , as shown in brain sections from mice . a trend toward lower worm burden changes was also found in the other three experimental groups, but the difference between experimental and control groups did not reach statistical significance. in summary, although specific antibodies against these four recombinant proteins could be induced, only the group immunized with cystatin acquired partial protection against a. cantonensis.

*significantly different compared to control group . after immunization, each mouse in two groups was challenged with  <dig> infective larvae  of a. cantonensis. the challenge experiment and protection analysis were performed once. each experimental group was composed of two parallel groups, each containing  <dig> mice.

discussion
in recent decades, relatively little attention has been paid to the nematode a. cantonensis, primarily because there have been few cases of human angiostrongyliasis. however, vast habitats with environmental conditions suitable for intermediate hosts of a. cantonensis exist in many places in mainland china  <cit> . thus, continuing to ignore this disease may no longer be an option. in this study, we reported our findings on the genetics of a. cantonensis, identifying  <dig> cdna sequences derived from l <dig> larvae isolated from mouse brains. these  <dig> cdnas and their putative protein products were then subjected to further in silico analyses.

host-parasite interplay
self-healing may be rapid in some cases of human angiostrongyliasis. we made a similar observation in mice: although some mice in experimental groups died within several days of being infected, others partially eliminated larvae from their bodies and survived. whether a co-adaptation between this nematode and its non-permissive host occurred is not yet clear, but such observations are suggestive of interplay between a. cantonensis and its host.

earlier studies on parasitic nematodes have shown that proteases are key factors for host-parasite interactions. because the larvae of a. cantonensis do not possess a buccal stylet, mucosal penetration is probably facilitated by tissue-degrading proteases. in this study, three of the four main protease families were identified, namely serine, cysteine and aspartic proteases. however, no transcripts of the fourth protease family, metalloproteases, were identified in this first set of clones, indicating that metalloproteases are expressed at low levels. a previous study demonstrated that serine proteases and metalloproteases secreted by this nematode were key to larval penetration of the mouse intestine  <cit> . the protease profile demonstrated here, in particular, the absence of metalloproteases, likely reflects differences in intestinal and cns parasitic modes. once larvae have penetrated the mouse intestine and entered the cns, they probably no longer need to excrete high levels of metalloprotease. in fact, continued expression of certain metalloproteases in the brain could be detrimental to parasite survival. to resist infections, the host usually secretes several factors that directly or indirectly eliminate challenging parasites. studies on blood-brain barrier  dysfunction in patients with eom caused by a. cantonensis have shown that entry of leukocytes into the cns is dependent on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases   <cit> . thus, the absence of metalloproteinase expression in l <dig> a. cantonensis larvae may contribute to host-parasite interplay by blunting the host immune response.

we also identified transcripts that encode other possible contributors to host-parasite interplay, including cystatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor, and frbp, which is involved in lipid metabolism. secretion of cystatin by larvae is associated with inhibition of the activity of immune killer cells of the host  <cit> . bm-cpi- <dig>  a homolog of cystatin secreted by the filarial parasite brugia malayi, inhibits class ii mhc-restricted antigen processing  <cit> . the product of the frbp gene is probably also involved in host-parasite interplay. a protein homologous to frbp that is secreted by adult ancylostoma caninum hookworms increases the infective abilities of larvae by reducing the amount of retinol available for repair of host tissue damage  <cit> . the expression patterns of the genes discussed above could serve a starting point for the study of host-parasite interplay in the mouse cns.

permissive hosts, such as the rat, acquire this nematode by ingesting l <dig> larvae. the larvae enter the bloodstream and reach the cns, where they molt twice to become adult worms in  <dig> weeks. the adult worms migrate to the pulmonary arteries, where they develop to sexual maturity and lay eggs  <cit> . however, in non-permissive hosts , the larvae are incapable of developing into adult worms and usually inhabit the cns. it has been reported that nematode development depends on  endocrine and immune signals of the host  <cit> . in the current study, several putative membrane receptors were found, including the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor , which regulates early development of the testis and ovary  <cit> , and the somatostatin receptor. we found that several conserved regions within the intracellular or extracellular loop of gnrhr were homologous between a. cantonensis and hosts , consistent with the idea that this nematode may be responsive to host hormonal signals. differences in parasite development and behavior may depend on such receptors, through receipt of different signals from different hosts. thus, developing a clearer understanding of the receptor types expressed by a. cantonensis could be important to understanding different parasitic behaviors in different hosts. going forward, our research on host-parasite interplay will focus on protease families and putative receptors.

diagnosis and treatment of angiostrongyliasis
several effective antigens, identifiable as immunoreactive bands, have been successfully used to diagnose human angiostrongyliasis  <cit> , but their amino acid sequences are not known. the absence of such information could be a significant limitation to large-scale production of engineered antigens. in this study, the individual recombinant proteins selected as antigens were not sufficiently sensitive to diagnose human angiostrongyliasis, and sensitivity was not improved using mixed antigens with different combinations of these four recombinant proteins. thus, at this stage, the sensitivities of the candidate proteins did not meet the criteria of a diagnostic kit. however, es antigens and extracellular proteins  seemed to more readily recognize positive sera than did proteins lacking excretory/secretory properties. thus, future efforts will focus on engineering proteins from this cdna library with excretory/secretory properties.

although most cases of human angiostrongyliasis are mild and self-limiting, death can occur in severe cases without prompt and proper treatment  <cit> . anthelmintic drugs, such as albendazole and mebendazole, are usually not recommended for treatment of a. cantonensis infections owing to the possibility of exacerbating neurological symptoms  <cit> . illuminating the basic biological behavior of larvae could provide clues for a more effective treatment strategy. based on gene ontology, we found that the putative products of a number of cdnas were involved in lipid metabolism and signal transduction pathways. more knowledge of relevant metabolic and signal transduction pathways will provide valuable information that could aid the identification potential drug targets for the future treatment of human angiostrongyliasis. the continued maintenance of a. cantonensis in a larval stage in the cns accounts for the insidious quality of human angiostrongyliasis. determining the mechanisms underlying the developmental behavior of a. cantonensis in different hosts may make it possible to induce larvae to migrate into pulmonary arteries of humans before administering a drug treatment program, thereby avoiding acute cns tissue damage.

CONCLUSIONS
although far from representing a comprehensive genome-wide gene expression study, the  <dig> cdnas identified here substantially increase the available genetic information about a. cantonensis. this study provides data that can be expected to aid angiostrongyliasis researchers in their selection of genes for future studies. the bioinformatic analysis described here establishes a framework for exploring the basic biology and biomedical implications of this dangerous nematode. larval metabolic pathways and host-parasite interactions are important to understanding the molecular basis of parasite behavior in different hosts. our future studies will focus on a comprehensive analysis of protein function and identification of more effective diagnostic antigens. we also note the need to make a concerted effort to improve the control of human angiostrongyliasis, which is an increasing public health problem in mainland china.
