BACKGROUND
nf-κb transcription factors are essential for innate and adaptive immunity, cell survival, cellular stress responses, development and maintenance of lymphoid organ structures, and other biological functions  <cit> . the vertebrate nf-κb family includes five structurally related members, the rel proteins rela , relb, crel, and the nf-κb proteins p <dig> and p <dig>  among the rel/nf-κb family, only rela, relb, and crel contain c-terminal transcriptional activation domains enabling them to directly regulate transcription. the other two members, p <dig> and p <dig>  are synthesized as p <dig> and p <dig> precursors, respectively. the rel and nf-κb proteins can form different homo- and heterodimers  that bind to dna target sites, so-called κb sites. in resting cells, rel/nf-κb proteins associate with inhibitory κb molecules  and are retained in the cytoplasm as inactive forms  <cit> .

two major nf-κb signaling pathways can be distinguished, the classical or canonical and the alternative or non-canonical pathway. in response to stimulation of transmembrane receptors like tumor necrosis factor receptor - <dig> or toll-like receptor - <dig>  signaling cascades are initiated that lead to the liberation of rel/nf-κb complexes from their iκb molecules. as a result, they translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription of numerous target genes. this classical pathway involves phosphorylation of iκbα by the nemo /ikkγ- and ikkβ-containing iκb kinase  complex followed by its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. regulation of gene transcription is predominantly mediated through p50-rela and p50-crel heterodimers and target genes are mainly involved in innate immunity, cell survival, and inflammation. a few inducers of nf-κb, like ltβr, are able to trigger an additional, so-called alternative or non-canonical pathway through the activation of nf-κb-inducing kinase  and ikkα. the alternative pathway governs gene regulation mainly through p52-relb heterodimers that are generated from the inactive cytoplasmic p100-relb complex via signal-dependent processing of the p <dig> inhibitor to p <dig>  this pathway controls genes that are predominantly involved in adaptive immunity and lymphoid organ development  <cit> . recent findings by hoffmann and colleagues extend this scenario. they could show that not only relb- but also rela-containing complexes can be released from the p <dig> inhibitor after ltβr stimulation  <cit> .

this report focuses on the transcriptional response downstream of the ltβr and its regulation by rela and relb. the role of ltβr signaling in development and organization of secondary lymphoid structures is well documented . we are interested in similarities and differences in rela and relb function in lymphoid organ development. however, a major problem is that rela-deficient  mice are embryonic lethal due to tumor necrosis factor -induced hepatocyte apoptosis  <cit> . moreover, relb-deficient  mice display impaired secondary lymphoid organ development and suffer from an autoinflammatory syndrome that also affects organization and function of lymphoid tissues  <cit> . thus, stromal compartments that display ltβr signaling and thereby have an organizational role in the development of lymphoid organs cannot be used for in vivo gene expression studies from the above animals. therefore, we applied mefs established from wild-type , rela-/-, and relb-/- mice as an in vitro model system. also, there is increasing evidence that ltβr functions beyond lymphoid organs, as it is involved in liver regeneration, hepatitis  <cit> , and hepatic lipid metabolism  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that ltβr signaling, via rela and/or relb, may participate in physiological processes other than lymphorganogenesis. mefs with different genotypes  allowed us to dissect specific rela and relb activities in the regulation of gene transcription after ltβr stimulation. in wt mefs, ltβr signals were predominantly transduced by rela- and/or relb-containing dimers. upon ltβr signaling in rela-/- cells, gene regulatory events were mediated by relb and vice versa in relb-/- cells, changes in gene expression were mediated by rela. using this system, we describe novel ltβr-responsive genes that were regulated solely by rela or relb or by both rela and relb.

RESULTS
ltβr stimulation of mefs
for ltβr stimulation, mefs of each genotype were either left untreated or were treated with agonistic anti-ltβr monoclonal antibody  for  <dig>  or  <dig> h. for each treatment group, cells from four experiments were pooled. nuclear protein extracts were used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays  to verify proper ltβr signaling . in wt cells, ltβr signaling resulted in modest induction of κb-binding complexes at the early time point  but strong induction after  <dig> h of stimulation. dissection of these complexes with supershifting antibodies revealed that the faster migrating complex contained relb and the slower migrating complex contained rela. as expected, in wt cells both rela and relb complexes were activated in response to ltβr signaling, whereas in rela-/- cells only relb- and in relb-/- cells only rela-containing κb-binding complexes were induced . recently, slow and relatively weak dna-binding of nf-κb complexes in response to ltβr ligation was reported  <cit> . the plateau was reached between  <dig> and  <dig> h of ltβr stimulation corresponding to a 2- to 3-fold induction of nf-κb dna binding. our results are in agreement with these observations: for each genotype the strongest induction of κb-binding complexes was observed at  <dig> h. for gene expression profiling we therefore used total rna isolated from untreated  and  <dig> h agonistic anti-ltβr mab treated wt, rela-/-, and relb-/- mefs, assuming that stronger dna-binding activity reflects stronger gene expression changes controlled by nf-κb transcription factor complexes.

global gene expression in response to ltβr stimulation in mefs
to identify rela- and relb-regulated genes after ltβr stimulation, we carried out microarray analysis using total rna from the experiment described above hybridized to codelink uniset mouse 20k i bioarrays. for statistical analysis, different genotypes were analyzed separately and significantly differentially expressed genes between time points  <dig> h and  <dig> h were identified . the fold change  threshold was determined from the minimal detectable fold change  calculated by the codelink expression analysis v <dig>  software . in response to ltβr stimulation, a total of  <dig> genes were regulated in wt cells. in line with the moderate nf-κb activation seen in the emsas the observed gene regulation was also modest: gene expression changes were in the range of +5-fold  and -5-fold . we assigned the  <dig> ltβr-responsive genes to  <dig> categories: genes that were significantly regulated  only in wt cells ,  in wt and rela-/- cells ,  in wt and relb-/- cells , and  genes that were significantly regulated in all  <dig> genotypes  .

the genes in these four categories could be segregated into further subcategories, which helped us to assign regulatory mechanisms underlying the expression patterns of individual genes .

category  i genes were significantly regulated only in wt cells in response to ltβr stimulation. this group of genes required both rela and relb for their ltβr-dependent activation  or repression . therefore, expression of these genes did not significantly change in either of the mutant cell lines in response to agonistic anti-ltβr mab treatment .

category ii genes were significantly regulated in wt and rela-/- cells upon ltβr ligation. genes upregulated  or downregulated  in both wt and rela-/- cells, but not significantly regulated in relb-/- cells, were considered to be relb target genes in response to ltβr signaling. other theoretical patterns could also be appointed to category ii, but we did not find any example in our analysis for these subcategories  .

genes belonging to category iii were significantly regulated in wt and relb-/- cells in response to ltβr stimulation. genes upregulated  or downregulated  in both wt and relb-/- cells, but not significantly regulated in rela-/- cells, were considered to be rela target genes in response to ltβr signaling. negligible numbers of genes in category iii could also be allocated to cat iii/ <dig> and iii/ <dig>  . however, these genes were not further analyzed. the significantly larger number of rela-  compared to relb-regulated genes  is likely to be a consequence of the stronger ltβr-induced dna binding of rela compared to relb complexes .

category iv genes were significantly regulated in each of the genotypes in response to ltβr ligation. although eight theoretically possible gene expression behaviors exist, we only found genes that belonged to two easily explainable scenarios: genes were either upregulated , or downregulated  in each genotype upon ltβr signaling . most likely, both rela and relb contributed redundantly to their regulation or alternatively, a third factor/pathway controlled these genes in response to ltβr stimulation. jnk  is a possible candidate for such a third pathway, as there are indications that ltβr stimulation leads to activation of jnk. however, the experimental setup in those studies was different from ours as ltβr-overexpressing hek <dig> cells  <cit>  or treatment of mefs with the ltβr agonist light   <cit>  were studied.

fc values observed in the three cell lines at  <dig> h compared to  <dig> h are displayed in a heatmap that also reflects the four categories and their subcategories .

interestingly, in the two subcategories with the largest number of genes both rela and relb together were required for ltβr-induced gene regulation . in case one of the transcription factors was missing the other one was not able to ensure regulation alone, suggesting significant crosstalk between the two nf-κb activation pathways. in response to ltβr stimulation, sequential engagement of the classical and alternative pathway was suggested, resulting in initial dna binding by rela followed by relb complexes  <cit> . these findings may suggest a scenario where rela binds first to the dna in the promoter of category i genes, loosens up chromatin, thereby enabling subsequent dna binding and gene regulatory action by relb  <cit> . alternatively, since relb is an nf-κb target gene  <cit>  rela may ensure sufficiently high expression of relb and in the absence of rela the reduced relb levels cannot mediate proper regulation of certain ltβr target genes. this possibility is supported by the observation that in the absence of rela both relb protein levels and binding of relb to κb sites were reduced   <cit> .

meta analysis of ltβr-dependent transcriptomes
ltβr signaling is best known in the context of secondary lymphoid organ development and a recent expression profiling study described ltβr-dependent transcriptomes in lymph nodes and follicular dendritic cells   <cit> . however, increasing evidence suggests that ltβr also plays a role in non-lymphoid organs such as epithelial tissues during embryonic development  <cit>  and adult liver  <cit> .

to interpret our results in the light of other studies investigating ltβr signaling, we compared our ltβr-responsive genes with two recently published ltβr-dependent transcriptomes. huber et al. identified transcripts in murine mesenteric lymph nodes affected in vivo by the administration of a soluble ltβr-ig decoy receptor which blocks ltβr signaling  <cit> . a gene cluster of  <dig> unique transcripts that showed decreased expression after ltβr blockade was further analyzed. twelve genes in this cluster were also associated with germinal centers /fdc. a few common genes were found between our analysis and the ltβr-dependent transcriptomes described by huber et al. dclk <dig> and enpp <dig>  expression was moderately decreased  <dig> d after ltβr blockade   <cit> . in our hands, both genes were upregulated in response to ltβr stimulation in a rela-dependent manner . enpp <dig> was also found to be associated with gc/fdc in mesenteric lymph nodes  <cit> . moreover, enpp <dig>  has been recently described as a new molecule in lymphocyte homing through high endothelial venules   <cit> . collectively, these findings suggest that ltβr, in addition to its well-described effect on the hev differentiation program  <cit> , further contributes via rela-dependent upregulation of enpp <dig> to lymphocyte homing through hevs. unfortunately, we could not detect further genes with a similar regulation pattern in our and huber and colleagues' studies. this lack of overlap could be the consequence of several reasons:  different modes of function and kinetics of antagonistic ltβr-ig vs agonistic anti-ltβr mab application,  incubation time , or  in vivo collection of different cell types influenced by the treatment vs in vitro cell culture system using mefs.

lo et al. described a hepatic gene expression profile of wt vs lck-light transgenic mice   <cit> . a group of significantly regulated genes  involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism was identified. the gene that displayed the highest level of regulation  encodes for hepatic lipase, a key enzyme in lipid metabolism. we did not observe repression of hepatic lipase in our experiments, most probably due to its restricted expression on the surface of hepatocytes. however, we found another gene belonging to the lipid/cholesterol metabolism-related group described by lo and colleagues. ralgds  expression was increased in the liver of transgenic mice and also upregulated in our ltβr stimulation experiments, belonging to the rela-responsive genes .

gene ontology  enrichment analysis
our goal was not only to define the ltβr-dependent transcriptome in mefs, but also to assign regulatory mechanisms to ltβr signaling, i.e. to examine which part of the ltβr transcriptome is regulated by rela, relb, or both. we started out with go enrichment analysis of significantly regulated genes to identify biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components putatively regulated in the categories described above. compared to molecular functions and cellular components, go analysis of biological processes yielded the most conclusive results.

first, go analysis was performed on the total ltβr transcriptome in wt cells to see how ltβr signaling influences biological processes in these fibroblasts, regardless whether these genes were also regulated in rela-/- or relb-/- cells . for interpretation of our data we chose go terms with p <  <dig> . as lower limit, we did not consider go terms with less than  <dig> annotated genes in the list of differentially regulated genes since they are too specific. as upper limit we did not use go terms represented by more than  <dig> genes on the microarray since they are too general. among the considered go terms we found that apoptosis/cell death - and cell cycle -related processes were overrepresented. we also found that genes annotated with "response to biotic stimulus", "immune system process"  features) as well as "blood vessel morphogenesis" and "angiogenesis"  features) were enriched. collectively, these data indicate that ltβr signaling largely influences cell survival/cell proliferation features. moreover, it has an impact on immune responses and blood vessel development/angiogenesis related processes. since these go terms were found in ltβr-stimulated "non-immune" fibroblasts it is likely that ltβr signaling regulates similar biological processes in stromal cells of secondary lymphoid tissues governing lymphorganogenesis and maintaining lymphoid tissue architecture.

analysis of functional enrichment was performed employing fisher's exact test. the number of genes annotated with a specific go term was determined for the list of differentially expressed genes  and compared to all go annotated genes on the array . the resulting p values  were used to rank go terms according to their significance. terms with more than  <dig> genes on the array or less than  <dig> genes on the list of investigated genes were regarded as too general or too specific, respectively, and excluded from the analysis. a/cd, apoptosis/cell death; ccy, cell cycle; ir, immune related; br, blood vessel development related.

next, we carried out go analysis for the four main categories and for all subcategories with at least  <dig> genes. interpretation of the data was performed applying the same criteria as above. go analysis of category i genes revealed those biological processes that were overrepresented only in ltβr-stimulated wt cells, i.e. in the presence of both rela and relb . amongst these processes, ccy-related terms dominated. subsequently, we analyzed cat i/ <dig>  and found enrichment of ir- and cell/biological adhesion -related terms on the list of biological processes . this finding indicates that in the absence of rela or relb a considerable portion of ltβr-stimulated immune response-related events cannot be carried out; fibroblasts need both molecules to execute these processes. in cat i/ <dig>  we found enrichment of ccy-related terms on the list of overrepresented biological processes . this finding indicates that in wt cells an important action of rela and relb is to downregulate numerous genes that are implicated in cell cycle regulation in response to ltβr signaling.

go analysis was performed the same way as for category "total wild-type" described in table  <dig> legend. ccy, cell cycle.

go analysis was performed the same way as for category "total wild-type" described in table  <dig> legend. ir, immune related.

go analysis was performed the same way as for category "total wild-type" described in table  <dig> legend. ccy, cell cycle.

since cat ii/ <dig> and ii/ <dig> had only few genes , investigation of go terms for these groups of genes was not meaningful. go analysis of the main category ii  revealed only one enriched go term, the cell cycle . thus, in response to ltβr signaling a characteristic feature of relb was to influence cell cycle-related events.

go analysis was performed the same way as for category "total wild-type" described in table  <dig> legend. ccy, cell cycle.

category iii contains genes that were regulated – either up or down – in wt and relb-/- cells in response to ltβr stimulation. among enriched biological processes, the new and in previous categories not yet observed theme taxis and response to external/chemical stimulus  dominated, but a/cd-related events also appeared . as expected, the theme ir was also represented among the enriched biological processes. this shows that rela is not only a signal transducer for immune responses and apoptosis/cell death, but also has an impact on the transcription of taxis- and stimulus-responsive genes following ltβr ligation. among the enriched biological processes of cat iii/ <dig> we observed again overrepresentation of t and ir processes , revealing that in response to ltβr signaling rela strongly influenced these events via upregulation of several genes. in cat iii/ <dig> we found genes that were repressed by rela. in this subcategory rela on one hand regulated several br events. on the other hand, it turned out to be a negative regulator of genes involved in ion homeostasis  downstream of the ltβr .

go analysis was performed the same way as for category "total wild-type" described in table  <dig> legend. t, taxis, response to external/chemical stimulus; a/cd, apoptosis/cell death; ir, immune related.

category iv contains genes that were regulated – either up or down – in each of the cell types in response to ltβr stimulation . ir processes were overrepresented, but the terms related to hematopoietic or lymphoid organ development  and taxis  were also present on the list of enriched biological processes. unfortunately, we could not analyze cat iv/ <dig>  as it comprises too few genes . cat iv/ <dig> contains  <dig> genes that were upregulated, irrespective of the genotype . these genes primarily belong to ir and t. possibly, rela and relb redundantly regulate these events or alternatively a rela- and relb-independent third factor/pathway  controls these biological processes following ltβr ligation. table  <dig> shows a summary of our go analysis.

go analysis was performed the same way as for category "total wild-type" described in table  <dig> legend. ir, immune related; t, taxis, response to external/chemical stimulus; ly, hematopoietic or lymphoid organ developmental processes.

verification of microarray results by qrt-pcr
the changes in mrna levels of several known as well as novel ltβr-responsive genes on the microarray were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription-pcr , using rna from three independent ltβr stimulation experiments . in agreement with previous reports, we also found induction of nfkb <dig>  <cit> , ccl2/mcp <dig>  <cit> , and ikba expression  <cit>  in ltβr-stimulated wt fibroblasts. in addition, our data indicate that both rela and relb redundantly contributed to the proper regulation of these genes in response to ltβr stimulation. however, we did not observe ltβr-dependent upregulation of lymphorganogenic chemokines as described by others. ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> were shown to be ltβr-induced genes in spleen  <dig> h after peritoneal injection of an agonistic anti-ltβr mab  <cit> . possibly, cell context-specific signaling accounts for the difference observed between splenocytes and established 3t <dig> fibroblasts used in our experiments. basak et al. observed modest upregulation of cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> in established wt 3t <dig> fibroblasts after  <dig> h treatment with agonistic anti-ltβr mab  <cit> . to reduce indirect gene regulatory effects due to rather long stimulation we activated ltβr signaling only for  <dig> h, where modulation of these chemokines was not observed.

genes that are discussed in chapter "meta analysis of ltβr-dependent transcriptomes" are indicated by an asterisk and genes that are discussed in chapter "verification of microarray results by qrt-pcr" are listed in bold.

importantly, we verified novel ltβr-responsive genes and appointed regulatory molecules to them. for a complete list of verified genes see table  <dig>  here, some of those verified genes are discussed in more detail.

go analysis revealed that ltβr stimulation resulted in the regulation of ir processes . except category "total wild-type", where we could not assign regulatory molecules, in all categories where ir processes were enriched, rela alone or together with relb acted as a positive factor. cx3cl <dig>  is one of the ir genes in cat i/ <dig>  several studies document that nf-κb upregulates cx3cl <dig>  e.g. in rat aortic endothelial cells upon interleukin-1β , tnf, and lipopolysaccharide treatment  <cit>  or in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells  <cit> . the latter work shows that atherogenic lipids induce adhesion of artery smooth muscle cells to macrophages via the upregulation of cx3cl <dig> in a tnf/nf-κb-dependent manner. in our experiments this gene was upregulated in response to ltβr stimulation dependent on rela and relb. this data suggests that ltβr, via employing rela and relb together, may act as a proatherogenic factor.

ir- and t-related processes were also enriched in cat iii and cat iii/ <dig> according to the go analysis. cd74/ii  and cxcl10/ip <dig>  are two genes in cat iii/ <dig> and assigned to ir and t. cd74/ii is involved in antigen processing and presentation and cxcl <dig> is chemotactic for monocytes and t cells. moreover, expression of cxcl <dig>  along with two other cxcr3-binding chemokines cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  can be induced in carcinoma cells by ltβr agonists. these chemokines function as potent chemoattractants for activated t, nk, and dendritic cells, which may contribute to antitumor immune responses  <cit> . in our experiments, expression of cd74/ii and cxcl10/ip <dig> was upregulated by ltβr signaling in wt and relb-/- cells. thus, ltβr signaling via rela may  attract t lymphocytes and promote antigen presentation by dendritic cells in the context of mhc class ii and  facilitate antitumor responses against cancer cells.

as indicated by go analysis, ir- and t-related biological processes were significantly regulated in cat iv and cat iv/ <dig>  amongst others, genes encoding proteins that participate in innate immune responses, like ccl7/mcp <dig>  are also represented in these groups. ccl7/mcp <dig> encodes the proinflammatory chemokine c-c motif ligand 7/monocyte chemotactic protein- <dig>  expression of ccl7/mcp <dig> was upregulated by ltβr signaling in each of the genotypes, indicating redundant positive regulation by rela and relb or upregulation via another rela- and relb-independent pathway.

collectively, positive regulation of the expression of proinflammatory chemokines like cx3cl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  by ltβr suggests that ltβr signaling, besides regulating development and organization of secondary lymphoid structures, also participates in innate/inflammatory immune responses and for that primarily rela action seems to be necessary.

moreover, we found that ltβr signaling functions beyond the regulation of immune responses and organization of lymphoid structures. pparγ  is a key-regulatory transcription factor in the process of adipocyte differentiation and activation of pparγ promotes the storage of fat  <cit> . the work of fu and colleagues suggests that ltβr affects lipid homeostasis by downregulating hepatic lipase expression  <cit> . hepatic lipase is expressed on the surface of hepatocytes in the liver. it promotes receptor-mediated uptake of plasma lipoproteins that harbor triglycerides and cholesterol and specifically catalyzes hydrolysis of triglycerides, actions that are suppressed when ltβr signaling is switched on. expression of pparg was negatively affected by ltβr signaling in wt and rela-/- but not in relb-/- cells , indicating that this gene was downregulated by relb in response to ltβr stimulation. our finding is a further indication that ltβr signaling represses lipogenesis and it may do so via relb. it has been shown that ligand-induced transactivation by pparγ is suppressed by il- <dig> and tnf and that this suppression is mediated through nf-κb   <cit> . however, unlike suppression of pparγ by p50-rela, where this heterodimer blocks pparγ binding to dna by forming a complex with pparγ and its co-activator pgc- <dig>  ltβr-mediated suppression of pparg occurred via transcriptional repression executed by relb. further experiments are required to find out whether relb directly or indirectly mediates repression of pparg transcription in response to ltβr signaling. the repressive effect of ltβr signaling on adipogenesis has been confirmed in mefs that were induced for adipogenic differentiation. ltβr stimulation resulted in attenuated lipid droplet accumulation as well as in reduced pparg and adipogenic marker gene  expression under conditions that promote differentiation into adipocytes .

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first systematic dissection of the rela- and relb-driven transcriptome response downstream of the ltβr. we confirmed previously described ltβr-regulated genes. more importantly, we identified novel ltβr-responsive genes and assigned underlying regulatory mechanisms executed by rela and/or relb to them . we found that the majority of ltβr-regulated genes required the presence of both rela and relb, suggesting significant crosstalk between the two nf-κb activation pathways. gene ontology analysis confirmed that ltβr-nf-κb target genes were predominantly involved in the regulation of immune responses. however, other biological processes such as apoptosis/cell death, cell cycle, angiogenesis, and taxis were also regulated by ltβr signaling. furthermore, we show that ltβr stimulation downregulated expression of the gene encoding pparγ, suggesting that ltβr signaling may repress adipogenic differentiation by attenuating the levels of this key adipogenic transcription factor. our findings are significant since they indicate a role for ltβr signaling beyond immune responses and lymphoid organ development and assign underlying gene expression regulatory mechanisms to the ltβr transcriptome.
