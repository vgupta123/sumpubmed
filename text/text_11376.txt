BACKGROUND
rice  is a staple food in asian countries. the population of asian countries has almost tripled over the past 50 years and today accounts for 60% of the world population  <cit> . to supply the necessary rice for food and other uses, rice breeders continue to look for new ways to increase yield. in the 1960s, high-yielding semi-dwarf cultivars such as ir <dig> were first released  <cit> . semi-dwarf cultivars were bred to be resistant to lodging under high nitrogen levels, which achieved their high yield  <cit> . ir <dig> was derived from crossing the taiwanese semi-dwarf cultivar dee geo woo gen, which carries the semi-dwarf  <dig>  gene, and the indonesian cultivar peta  <cit> . the sd <dig> gene derived from ir <dig> or other cultivars has played a crucial role in the breeding of high-yielding rice.

increasing grain size or weight can improve yield by enlarging the sink size. previous studies  have identified several genes associated with sink size and have shown that these genes could increase the 1000-grain weight of rice. the ability to produce fully mature seed is also an important trait for high-yielding rice because immature seeds reduce not only total grain weight, but also grain quality. recently, allelic differences in the rice flowering-time gene dth <dig> were found to influence seed maturation  <cit> . another gene controlling flowering time, ghd <dig>  has been reported to regulate traits involved in yield potential, such as plant height and the number of spikelets per panicle  <cit> . however, no single gene among those identified as controlling sink size can fully improve rice yield on its own. therefore, the association between sink size genes and yield traits needs to be clarified by using a diverse genetic population.

because of the utilization of rice for forage and bioethanol production in japan, the materials used for breeding of high-yielding rice cultivars have changed drastically since the mid-1980s. semi-dwarf indica cultivars have been extensively used as parental lines and crossed with japanese japonica cultivars to produce high-yielding rice cultivars for japan  <cit> .

thus, it is likely that the introgression of genomic regions from indica cultivars has contributed to the improvement of yield and other traits such as disease resistance in current japanese high-yielding rice cultivars.

to identify the genes needed to produce high-yield rice cultivars, it is essential to develop genetic tools for the molecular dissection of current high-yielding cultivars and other breeding materials. recently, next-generation sequencing technology has identified genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms  among diverse rice accessions. large numbers of snps, which are often used in combination with high-throughput genotyping systems, have been widely used for genetic diversity analyses of diverse populations , breeding materials  and for mutation analyses  <cit> . moreover, associations between traits and snps have been discovered by genome-wide association mapping in diverse populations  <cit> . these research platforms will allow us to elucidate genomic regions involved in yield potential and to accelerate the introgression of desirable genes into breeding materials.

in the present study, we used a genome-wide association study  strategy to identify genomic regions contributing to high yield in japanese rice cultivars derived from indica–japonica crosses. to dissect the fine genomic structures of admixed cultivars, we established a novel snp set from previously discovered snps. we identified regions within the high-yielding cultivars with high frequencies of either indica or japonica alleles and detected associations of these regions with traits contributing to high yield in japanese cultivars.

RESULTS
development of a snp set for the analysis of genomic constitutions of japanese high-yielding rice cultivars
a high-density snp set is essential for detailed analysis of genome constitution. to obtain a set of informative snps evenly distributed across the rice genome, we surveyed  <dig> snps in  <dig> high-yielding or primary ancestral cultivars . a subset of  <dig> informative snps was selected on the basis of no missing data and the absence of low-frequency alleles . by performing a simulation for complete linkage disequilibrium , which was estimated by comparing the genotypes of pairs of neighboring snp alleles, we estimated the number of snps required for practical use in the analysis of genomic constitutions of japanese high-yielding rice cultivars. as the number of snps increased, the mean value of complete ld also increased, but reached a plateau at approximately  <dig> snps . using this information and considering the analytical system and cost for the analysis, we randomly selected  <dig> snps from among the  <dig> informative snps as a practical number for this analysis .figure  <dig> 
mean values of complete linkage disequilibrium  estimated for snp sets of different sizes. snp sets of different sizes were randomly chosen across the genome , and mean values of complete ld were calculated for each set size. vertical bars show the standard error.



genome classification of japanese high-yielding rice cultivars
the genetic diversity of japanese high-yielding rice cultivars was estimated from the polymorphism information content  value and related values such as heterozygosity. these values were not strongly affected by sample size and were larger for samples of japanese high-yielding rice cultivars  than for samples of either domestic  or overseas  parents, which contained both japonica and indica cultivars . they were also larger than those of the indica and japonica samples in both wrc and jrc populations .table  <dig>

because japanese high-yielding rice cultivars were derived from crosses between japonica and indica cultivars , the genomes of many high-yielding cultivars would be expected to represent an admixture of indica and japonica genome types. to show the extent of admixture, a structure analysis was applied to japanese high-yielding cultivars and other reference cultivars with taxon information. for an assumed number of populations, structure analysis can estimate the proportional contribution of each ancestral population to each cultivar.

the structure obtained for k  =  <dig> seemed to correspond to japonica, indica, and an admixture of the two . at k =  <dig>  the admixture group was subdivided into two groups, one representing an admixture of indica and japonica cultivars, the other containing tropical japonica cultivars. these structures were compared to the categories of accessions determined by previous studies . the structure consisting of four groups  best fit the clustering results.figure  <dig>

combination of genomic regions derived from overseas and domestic parental cultivars in genomes of japanese high-yielding rice
structure and cluster analysis showed that most of the overseas parental cultivars were classified into the indica group and the domestic parents into the japonica group . to determine the genome type most prevalent in each chromosomal region, we focused on  <dig> of the  <dig> snps. this subset was able to discriminate between the overseas indica  and domestic japonica  parental materials and allowed us to determine the distribution of japonica and indica alleles in the genome of japanese high-yielding rice cultivars . the japanese high-yielding cultivars showed different levels of genome-type mixing and could be generally classified into three types: japonica alleles dominant throughout the genome , indica alleles dominant throughout the genome  and an even mixture of both types . these three types corresponded to the japonica type, indica type and admixture type classified in the structure and cluster analyses. although the high-yielding cultivars differed widely in genome structure, in certain chromosome regions of the mixtures, one genome type or the other seemed to dominate; for example, the short arm of chromosome  <dig> and most of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> contained predominantly indica alleles .figure  <dig>

phenotype annotation for frequently introgressed regions of indica or japonica genomes
we hypothesized that genomic regions of japanese high-yielding cultivars that were dominated by a particular genome type  might be involved in yield-related traits. to test this hypothesis, we performed association mapping in a population consisting of  <dig> selected lines with different yield-related traits and then examined the identified regions for highly skewed allele frequencies of either the indica or the japonica type. significant associations  were detected at eight snp loci for six yield-associated traits . associations with surface area of unhusked seeds were detected at four loci and associations with five other traits  were detected at one or two loci each. all of these loci were located in genomic regions dominated by indica-type alleles  except for one locus at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  which was dominated by the japonica-type allele. a locus at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> showed correlation with surface area of unhusked seeds, length of unhusked seeds and 1000-grain weight. interestingly, the values of all traits were smaller with indica-type alleles than with japonica-type alleles at this locus. a significant association was observed between surface area of unhusked seeds and loci at both  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  at each of the three loci, the indica allele increased the surface area. at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  the indica allele was significantly associated with earlier heading. at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  the indica allele was associated with significantly reduced unhusked seed length. at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  the indica allele was associated with reduced panicle number. at  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  the indica allele was associated with increased blast resistance.table  <dig>

by searching databases of functionally characterized genes and quantitative trait loci  in rice  <cit> , we identified two genes and four qtls as candidates in these eight regions. ghd <dig>  which regulates flowering time and yield potential  <cit> , was near the snp at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  and the blast resistance gene pi-ta <cit>  was near the snp locus at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  information in the qtl database q-taro  <cit>  suggested that four qtls for the traits related to yield or blast resistance  were located close to three of the snp loci .

classification of ghd <dig> and pi-ta alleles
to determine whether the allele types of candidate genes ghd <dig> and pi-ta were consistent with those of nearby snps having significant phenotype associations, we surveyed the relevant genome sequences of five japanese high-yielding cultivars and one overseas parental cultivar. indica- or japonica-specific alleles have been reported in previous studies of both ghd <dig> <cit>  and pi-ta <cit> . we then compared the allele types of the snps and candidate genes in the six cultivars. in ghd <dig>  the promoter region snp s_ <dig> and the predicted amino acids at four positions  in the five japanese high-yielding cultivars coincided with the allele type at the nearest significant snp locus, nias_os_ac <dig> . four of the five high-yielding cultivars  had an indica-type allele for the snp locus and at the five positions within ghd <dig>  as did overseas parental cultivar suweon  <dig>  for pi-ta, the predicted amino acid sequences at three positions  corresponded to the same allele type as the nearest significant snp, nias_os_aa <dig>  thus, the snp alleles nearest ghd <dig> and pi-ta can be used as markers to discriminate the allele type at each of these two loci.table  <dig>

discussion
yield is a complicated trait involving multiple component traits such as seedling vigor, photosynthetic rate, heading date and others; in turn, these traits are considered to be controlled by multiple genes. therefore, it has been difficult to identify any single factor associated with increased yield potential in rice. combining diverse alleles from indica and japonica is one way to produce desirable genotypes for high-yielding rice. to achieve this, cross-breeding has been conducted for over 30 years and, in fact, significant increases in yield potential have been achieved  <cit> . it is expected that such high-yielding cultivars resulted from unique combinations of the indica and japonica genomes, but until now, no report has presented the genome-wide genotypes of such high-yielding cultivars. in this study, we selected informative snp sets to visualize the whole-genome genotypes of such cultivars and identified various combinations of the indica and japonica genomes. interestingly, the japanese high-yielding rice cultivars could be divided into three groups: one dominated by japonica genome regions, one dominated by indica genome regions, and one containing admixtures. the combination of indica and japonica factors appears to have the greater potential for increasing yield because the admixture-type cultivars were most prevalent. some chromosomal regions had highly skewed allele frequencies, suggesting that regions associated with high-yielding phenotypes had been conserved during the process of breeding selection.

gwas is undoubtedly an effective way to detect qtls, but is not very useful for a population consisting of improved cultivars, owing to the population structure. when using a population with a strong structure, the probability of detecting false-positive associations is higher than in a genetically divergent population. in spite of this risk, identification of valuable haplotypes underlying rice breeding populations is necessary to enable acceleration of the selection process. here, we used the gwas strategy to associate genomic regions having highly skewed indica or japonica allele frequencies with yield-related phenotypes. several previous gwass  <cit>  have shown that chromosomal regions associated with several characters, from simple domestication traits such as a glutinous phenotype to more complex traits such as flowering time and seed size, were introgressed from one cultivar group into another. in this study, we detected eight genome regions with significant phenotypic associations, two of which were near previously reported functionally characterized genes. both the positions and the phenotypes associated with the latter two genome regions coincided with the positions and phenotypes of ghd <dig> and pi-ta.

heading date is an important trait that affects yield and plant type . we detected a significant signal associated with heading date at position  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  near ghd <dig> <cit> , and the type of snp allele in each of six cultivars coincided with the type of ghd <dig> allele in that cultivar. the indica and japonica alleles found in japanese high-yielding rice cultivars correspond to ghd7- <dig> and ghd7- <dig>  respectively. a previous study  <cit>  concluded that ghd7- <dig> is a fully functional allele that confers late heading and that ghd7- <dig> is a weak functional allele that confers an intermediate phenotype. however, the allele effects of ghd <dig> in our materials were the opposite of those previously reported: strains containing the ghd7- <dig>  allele flowered earlier than those containing ghd7- <dig> . other studies have also found large variations in heading date among cultivars with the same ghd <dig> allele  <cit> . these differences might be caused by the interaction of ghd <dig> with other genes controlling heading date.

under the current system of rice cultivation, which uses paddy fields as efficiently as possible, cultivars with short growth duration from seeding to maturing may be suitable for obtaining optimal yield  <cit> . we also observed a negative correlation between heading date and surface area of unhusked seed . the strong positive relationship between surface area of unhusked seed and 1000-grain weight might indicate that early heading contributes to an increase in seed weight per grain . thus, we conclude that early heading associated with the indica-ghd <dig> allele is important for grain filling in japanese high-yielding rice.

pi-ta is one of several rice blast resistance genes, and the indica-type allele has been reported to confer resistance  <cit> . the indica-type allele found in japanese high-yielding rice cultivars was identical to the corresponding resistance alleles of yashiromochi  and tetep . it has also been suggested that progeny of suweon  <dig> contain pi-ta or pi-ta <dig> <cit> . we conclude that the frequently introgressed region from indica rice detected at position  <dig>  mb of chromosome  <dig> contains an allele of pi-ta that confers resistance.

our analysis showed a second snp  on chromosome  <dig> associated with blast susceptibility. because it was located more than 10 mb from snp nias_os_aa <dig> , other blast resistance genes might be located in this region. studies of the distribution of disease resistance loci  <cit>  and nucleotide-binding-site genes  <cit>  in the rice genome have shown that many loci or genes associated with disease resistance are located in the middle part of chromosome  <dig>  according to our data, parents from overseas were the donors of blast resistance genes now found in high-yielding rice in japan.

in several other chromosomal regions that did not contain candidate genes, we detected significant snps co-located with four putative qtls for yield traits. the reliability of the qtls registered in q-taro  <cit>  is indicated by lod values, which were relatively high for these qtls . two putative qtls  <cit>  near the end of the long arm of chromosome  <dig> were associated with grain weight, as was a snp in this same region, nias_os_aa <dig>  although this region was categorized as highly skewed towards indica-type alleles, the japonica-type allele was associated with higher grain weight. this direction of allele effect coincided with that of a previously identified qtl   <cit> . meanwhile, previous studies  <cit>  reported that qtls for other yield traits were also co-localized in the same region. notably, a qtl associated with grain number per panicle was detected in two previous qtl studies  <cit> , and the non-japonica allele identified in this region resulted in an increase in grain number per panicle  <cit> . in this genome region, the selection of qtls for traits such as grain number per panicle might have been stronger than for grain size and weight.

a previously reported qtl  <cit>  near the location of snp nias_os_aa <dig> on chromosome  <dig> was associated with 1000-grain weight. this snp was associated with the length of unhusked seeds, which were longer when the japonica-type allele was present. the direction of allele effect was unclear in the previous study, but the candidate qtl was very reliable because it was detected in two different populations  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that several qtls for seed size might be located in this region.

despite the association of yield-related phenotypes  with three other snps with highly skewed allele frequencies , we could not find any candidate genes or qtls in these regions. characterization of currently unknown qtls for yield such as these would contribute to the development of high-yielding rice.

we did not detect significant qtls responsible for either of the direct yield traits  examined in this study. this implies that the contribution of many qtls with small effects and/or interaction among several qtls, possibly with large effects, control these traits. however, our findings of the skewed allele frequencies in japanese high-yielding rice cultivars and of significant qtls controlling other yield-related phenotypes will help to elucidate the complicated genetic mechanisms controlling rice yield.

CONCLUSIONS
introgression breeding from indica to japonica or from japonica to indica is an established strategy for the accumulation of qtls and genes controlling high yield while avoiding negative effects such as hybrid weakness, which is often a barrier to making wide crosses. our informative snp set is an effective tool for the identification of introgressed indica regions in japonica genetic backgrounds and vice versa. additionally, we have demonstrated that phenotypic annotation of introgressed regions is possible. future studies leading to additional phenotype annotations for introgressed genomic regions would accelerate the identification and accumulation of qtls and genes for the development of high-yielding rice.
