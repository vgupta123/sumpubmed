BACKGROUND
the rhesus monkey  is one of the species of macaca, an old world monkey. on the basis of dna sequence comparison complemented by fossil evidence, the divergence of humans and old world monkeys is estimated at about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the relationship between humans and rhesus monkeys is even more important because biomedical research has come to depend on these primates as experimental animal models  <cit> . due to their genetic, physiologic, and metabolic similarity to humans, this species serves as an essential research tool in neuroscience, behavioral biology, reproductive physiology, neuroendocrinology, endocrinology, cardiovascular studies, pharmacology and many other areas  <cit> .

the draft sequence of the rhesus monkey genome, which has an important evolutionary position, was published in  <dig>  <cit> . the final challenge comes in the understanding of basic rhesus molecular biology through interpretation of the rhesus monkey genome. transcriptome data could broaden the application of genome sequences. one of the most useful approaches obtaining large-scale sequence information is through the construction and sequencing of cdna libraries  <cit> . these libraries represent a collection of genes that have been expressed as mrna in a given cell or tissue, and are especially useful for obtaining sequence information on the coding regions of the genome  <cit> . previous effort to catalogue the rhesus monkey transcriptome were based on expressed sequence tags  used for the identification of genes, prediction of genes, and assessment of gene expression  <cit> . also, a comparative analysis of mrna sequences may provide clues to the genetic information that affects the different phenotypes  <cit> . however, the usefulness of est clones is limited; because many est clones lack the complete sequences of mrnas, they cannot be used to reveal the primary structures of entire genes and encoded proteins  <cit> . ests are useful for making a catalog of expressed genes, but not for further study of gene function. consequently, genome-scale collections of the full-length cdnas of expressed genes become important for the analysis of the structure and function of genes  <cit> . in contrast to the great number of human full-length cdna sequences in public databases such as the refseq mrnas of the national center for biotechnology information, only a small number of rhesus monkey mrna sequences and ests have been deposited in public databases.

in this study, full-length-enriched cdna libraries were constructed from rhesus monkey placenta using the oligo-capping method  <cit> . this method can efficiently identify apparent rhesus monkey homologs of human refseq mrna sequences and collect the full insert sequence. therefore, the full-length cdna strategy was adopted to sequence and analyze a collection of  <dig> cdna sequences from placental cdna library of a rhesus monkey. full-length cdna of the rhesus monkey will be beneficial for performing future genetic and biomedical studies.

RESULTS
rhesus monkey cdna library construction and sequencing
rhesus monkey placenta was harvested and used to generate a normalized, directional cdna library. around  <dig> clones were randomly picked from the cdna library and subjected to single-pass 5' sequencing using the cytomegalovirus primer located up-stream of the vector backbone. after trimming low-quality and vector sequences and removing contaminant host sequences, a total number of  <dig> high-quality  ests were obtained with a mean length of  <dig> bp. the length distributions of the ests are shown in figure  <dig>  cdna length ranged from 170- <dig> bp with an average of  <dig> bp. these average lengths were likely limited by sequencing technology. all cdna sequences have been deposited in genbank with continuous accession number of fs722297-fs <dig> 

gene identification and sequences analysis of known rhesus monkey cdna sequences
the cdna library derived from rhesus monkey placenta was constructed by the oligo-capping method. two thousand sequences of rhesus monkey placental cdna were annotated by the blast program. since refseq sequences contain partially overlapped isoforms, non-redundant refseq sequences were constructed based on the entrez gene database. consequently,  <dig> vector sequences that were included in the raw sequence data were eliminated. to classify these rhesus monkey cdnas and find their human homologues, blast searches were performed to human refseq databases. of the  <dig> cdna sequences,  <dig> were homologous to the human refseq gene set and were clustered into  <dig> types of genes, indicating that the cdna sequences would cover approximately  <dig> % of the known human genes . using the protein coding gene set of the rhesus monkey cdna as defined by human refseq mrna database, the frequency of mapping in 5'untranslated repeat , 5'utr_cds, cds, cds_3'utr, 3'utr, and 5'utr-cds-3'utr was investigated at various distances from genes. of the annotated  <dig> cdna transcripts, only about 86% of these  were present within the known gene regions:  <dig> mapping in 5' utr,  <dig> in 5'utr_cds,  <dig> in cds,  <dig> in cds_3'utr,  <dig> in 3utr, and  <dig> in 5'utr-cds-3'utr . of those that matched human refseq mrnas,  <dig> cdna sequences contained the full coding region with 5'utr and 3'utr sequences. although the oligo-capping cdna library construction method was aimed to generate full-length cdna sequences, the results indicated that only  <dig> transcripts were derived by 5'utr sequences. this relative low percentage of full-length inserts was mainly due to the fact that the method used was not optimized to generate a full-insert cdna library.

another study reported the initial sequencing and comparative analysis of rhesus monkey cdna sequences from  <dig> tissues. these  <dig>  sequence data from three different macaque species represented an initial sampling of the putative rhesus orthologs for  <dig> human genes, and the researchers focused on the genetic divergence between the human and non-human primate  <cit> . because their cdna libraries were constructed from the poly -primed cdna, their method for uni-zap cdna library construction could not aim at the full-length cdna sequences. however, the present oligo-capping method with normalization could capture non-redundant full-length mrna sequences. to declare the differences between the present and previous  <cit>  data, the prior results were reanalyzed. although a total of  <dig>  sequence reads from  <dig> rhesus monkey tissues had been sequenced, the present reanalysis retrieved and analyzed placenta tissue data sets of  <dig>  sequences. of these sequences,  <dig> cdna sequences corresponding to  <dig> human refseq genes  were collected . intriguingly, only  <dig> genes overlapped with the previous analysis. although the main target of placenta tissues is the same, their results showed quite different data sets. these different results reflect the gap in knowledge in the identification and analysis of rhesus monkey genes.

similarity analysis between human and rhesus monkey cdna sequences
from the  <dig> sequences, consensus sequences could be constructed to  <dig> rhesus monkey genes by aligning with at least two sequences of individual genes and the nucleotide sequence identity between humans and rhesus monkey. sequence identities were calculated between  <dig> rhesus monkey consensus sequences and the corresponding human refseq mrna sequences. these  <dig> consensus cdna sequences of  <dig> rhesus monkey genes aligned with 5'utr_cds_3'utr, 5'utr-cds, cds, cds_3'utr and 3'utr regions of human refseq mrnas . the average sequence identity of the 5'utr_cds in  <dig> cdnas was  <dig> %, 5'utr_cds_3'utr in  <dig> cdnas was  <dig> %, cds in  <dig> cdnas was  <dig> %, cds_3'utr in  <dig> cdnas was  <dig> %, and 3'utr in  <dig> was  <dig> %. the patterns of divergence were different from the 5'utrs, cdss, and 3'utrs. the sequence divergence in the 5'utrs and cds region was significantly lower than that of 3'utr sequences. these results coincided with a previous study indicating the sequence identity between human and rhesus monkey cdna was  <dig> % in coding sequence and  <dig> % in 3'utrs  <cit> . upstream and coding regions of functional genes are very important  <cit> . thus, these regions are evolutionary well-conserved in comparison with 3' utr regions. specifically, sequence substitution in the cds region could disrupt the important functional domain or coding frames. moreover, this substitution in the 5'utr region also could interrupt the binding interaction between regulatory binding sites and regulatory elements.

use of the present oligo-capping method enabled the construction of full-length-enriched cdna libraries from rhesus monkey placenta tissue. although various genomics projects have focused on sequencing of the genome or ests, full-length cdna sequences are uniquely informative resources for accurately predicting the full spectrum of the transcriptome in specific species  <cit> .

analysis of unknown transcripts
of the  <dig> placenta cdna sequences,  <dig> sequences were not homologous to the human refseq mrna sequences . although  <dig> transcripts are not annotated with human refseq mrna sequences, their sequences matched with the non-refseq mrna  and ests  sequences in the database. finally,  <dig> transcripts were designated as unknown transcripts.

to characterize the  <dig> unknown transcripts, two individual strategies were established. one is the human genome aligning method with open reading frame  coding method . the other uses only the orf coding method . among the  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> transcripts matched with the human genome using blast . remarkably, these  <dig> transcripts also contained orfs with lengths ranging from 44- <dig> amino acids . these unknown transcripts were identified in known gene regions or intergenic region. furthermore, their matching patterns in human genome were similar with splicing patterns. these matching regions were designated as "block". although detailed characterization and experimental validation of these  <dig> transcripts was not done, they could be valuable sources for the novel gene candidates.

a, the aligned regions were determined by comparing the blast results with the refgene database.

among the  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> were analyzed only using orf coding. because these  <dig> transcripts did not share significant similarities with any human genome, they were anticipated to be rhesus monkey specific transcripts. however, due to the limitation of rhesus monkey genome availability, this analysis could not be done. these  <dig> unknown transcripts clearly contain orf regions that average  <dig> amino acids in length . these results should also prove interesting for the identification of lineage specific rhesus monkey transcripts.

the results of species specific transcripts indicated in the present analysis are consistent with recent comparative analysis between human and chimpanzee  <cit> . these species specific transcripts could be informative clues for the explanation of different characters. the rhesus monkey is one of the most widely-used and valuable biomedical animal models for the investigation of numerous human diseases. this information would provide a better understanding of the genetic information of rhesus monkey species.

indel analysis
indel sequences of placenta expressed transcripts were analyzed between human and rhesus monkey. if a sequence was aligned in more than one place in a genome, only the high-scoring sequence pair alignments was kept to ensure that a sequence mapped to a single locus. we selected human and rhesus monkey gene regions bearing nucleotide indels when aligned to the genome. a total of  <dig> transcripts showed different transcript structures. next, the frequency of indels was investigated in 5'utr, 5'utr_cds, cds, cds_3'utr, and 3'utrs in putative rhesus monkey genes. of the  <dig> indels regions,  <dig> were located in functional gene regions including  <dig> in 5'utr, seven in 5'utr_cds,  <dig> in cds,  <dig> cds_3'utr, and  <dig> in 3'utr regions . moreover, the indel density in the 3'utrs was significantly lower than the 5'utr regions. indels could disrupt important motifs in regulatory regions and also alter the spacing between regulatory binding sites. the present analysis revealed low indel density in the 5'utr region and high indel density in the 3'utr region and, especially, the cds region. these results may be explained by selection acting against indels in specific regions.

presently, a screening procedure was developed to identify putative rhesus monkey specific exons with transposable elements in alternative splicing events. exons were analyzed using rhesus monkey placenta cdna sequences. the  <dig> candidates were manually inspected to narrow them to two highly plausible cases: exons that exhibited alternative splicing patterns in the rhesus monkey but not in humans. moreover, some alternative splicing events were rhesus monkey specific: the rhesus monkey exon of the bcs1l gene was derived from rhesus monkey specific aluyra <dig> elements . aluyra <dig> is commonly considered to be a rhesus monkey specific alu element  <cit> . in addition, the rhesus monkey specific exon of ccdc <dig> was derived from mer11b elements . intriguingly, two rhesus monkey specific exons were derived from the transposable elements of aluyra <dig>  and mer11b . these two transposable elements are abundant in different genomic regions including intergenic regions and intron regions. the consensus te element, specifically alu elements, carries multiple sites that are similar, but not identical, to the real splice site  <cit> . therefore, these two elements could be frequently exonized as primate-specific exons and could thus be used to identify the bcs1l and ccdc <dig> genes showing rhesus monkey specific indels.

the present study demonstrated the evolutionary occurrence of species-specific exons by alternative splicing of transposable elements in the gene during evolution. although an absolute determination of species specificity will require complete rhesus monkey genome sequencing or experimental validation, preliminary computational analysis could be done to test the presence or absence of these sequences in the human and other primate genomes. several studies have characterized the series of mutations needed occur within a transposable element in order to generate a new exon  <cit> . for example, it was described in the human rna editing enzyme adar <dig>  where exon  <dig> is a new alu-derived primate-specific exon that is alternatively spliced in high inclusion levels  <cit>  in a tissue-regulated manner. the new exon is inserted in the catalytic domain of adar <dig> and, while the exon-containing variant has the same substrate specificity as the original one, it has an altered catalytic activity  <cit> . moreover, 62% of new exons in human are associated with primate-specific alu retroposons, and 28% of new exons in rodents are derived from rodent-specific sines  <cit> . therefore, it seems that, in primates, the transposable elements exonization mechanism is being used as a major source for acetated, lineage specific evolution, and is perhaps a key driving force to eventual speciation.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a cdna library was constructed using an oligo-capping method from the placenta of the rhesus monkey, and approximately  <dig>  randomly picked normalized clones were sequenced. the  <dig> rhesus monkey placenta full-length cdna sequences described here significantly expands the molecular resources available for the genus. further analysis revealed  <dig> transcripts in rhesus monkey cdna, in which  <dig> did not share significant similarities with any human genome. such sequence information was used in comparative analysis to identify novel genes specifically expressed in rhesus monkey. moreover, some alternative splicing events are rhesus monkey specific: rhesus monkey exons of bcs1l and ccdc <dig> genes were derived from rhesus monkey specific aluyra <dig> and mer11b elements, respectively. increasing the genomic resources and information of rhesus monkeys will greatly contribute to the development of evolutionary biology and biomedical sciences. the construction of a large scale collection of full-length cdna sequence from rhesus monkey placenta tissue and homology searches in databases would facilitate the discovery of novel genes.
