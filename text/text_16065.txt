BACKGROUND
comprehensive molecular biological approaches, including genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses are powerful, essential tools for understanding the phenotype of all living organisms. in recent years, high-throughput dna sequencing technologies have enabled the sequencing of a microbial genome in a few days. however, the identification, annotation, and curation of genes have been limiting factors in the analysis of new genomes. the criteria for identifying and annotating genes depend on the curator. usually, curators should annotate all open reading frames  based on the features of promoter regions, such as the presence or absence of shine-dalgarno sequences, and based on homology searches with nucleic acid databases. moreover, databases such as ncbinr in the national center of biotechnology information  have been updated, although microbial genomes seem to contain several "conserved hypothetical protein " or "hypothetical protein ", and unrecognized coding sequences   <cit> . the revision of previously published genomes is a concern for many researchers; however, there are only a few cases of revisions of original genome annotations in public databases  <cit> . several studies reported the evaluation of published genomes by developed orf finding algorithms with expended databases  <cit> . another approach for genome re-evaluation was performed using support from experimental evidence, such as transcriptomic or proteomic analysis  <cit> .

streptococcus pyogenes, group a streptococci  is an important human pathogen that causes various infectious diseases, including pharyngitis, scarlet fever, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. efforts have been made to illustrate the proteomic profile of gas, as several secreted or membrane-associated proteins from this pathogen are responsible for these diseases  <cit> . gas sf <dig> is a significant strain that has been widely used in research because its genome has been available since  <dig> <cit> . since then, another  <dig> gas genomes have become available  <cit> . however, approximately 40% of sf <dig> genes still remained annotated as chyp or hyp. furthermore, the number of annotations has approximately  <dig> fewer protein-coding sequences  compared to other sequenced gas strains that possess almost the same genome, both in terms of composition and size  <cit> . it is assumed that a number of unrecognized cdss reside in the relatively larger intergenic regions or overlap another reading frame. in fact, we previously identified two proteins that we deduced to be encoded by unrecognized cds in sf <dig>  <cit> .

in the present study, we attempted to identify unrecognized cdss in sf <dig> and verified the mrna expressions of these cdss using reverse transcription pcr . in addition, proteomic analysis provided functional annotations for chyps and hyps in sf <dig>  the revision of the annotation should provide useful information for researchers studying this pathogen.

RESULTS
intra-species genomic overview of gas
the genomes of  <dig> s. pyogenes strains have been sequenced, and the number of protein coding genes that have been annotated in each genome ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the total length of the mgas <dig> genome was  <dig>  bp greater than that of sf <dig>  and contains  <dig> more cdss than that of sf <dig>  to summarize the variations in genome analysis data of s. pyogenes, each genome feature is listed in additional file  <dig>  cds coverage was estimated from the total length of cdss that were annotated in each genome. the average genome length of the  <dig> strains of s. pyogenes was  <dig> , <dig> bp, the average cds coverage was  <dig> %, the average number of genes was  <dig> , the average length of protein coding genes was  <dig> bp, and the average number of protein coding genes was  <dig> . sf <dig> was the first gas strain to be sequenced in  <dig> and it had a comparatively lower cds coverage  and fewer number of protein coding genes  than other gas strains. in contrast, its average length of protein coding genes  was the highest. although the genome of mgas <dig> serotype m <dig> exhibited differences in several of its prophage contents, small insertions or deletions, and snps, its gene components were similar to that of sf <dig>  <cit> . the number of protein coding genes annotated for mgas <dig> chromosome was  <dig> more than that for sf <dig>  whereas the chromosome size of mgas <dig> was  <dig>  bp greater than that of sf <dig>  this difference in total genome length should correspond to 15- <dig> protein-coding genes based on the average length of protein coding genes. these results indicated that several genes might have been unrecognized among the cdss in sf <dig> 

expression of unrecognized cdss in sf370
a mixture of the tryptic-digested proteins of sf <dig> was applied to liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry . the digested products were separated using a reversed linear gradient. an overview of the shotgun proteomic analysis is shown in additional file  <dig>  to find unrecognized cdss in sf <dig> genome annotation, the product ion mass lists were queried using the mascot program and an in-house database comprising  <dig>  six-frame orfs. a total of  <dig> orfs were identified through all lc-ms/ms shotgun experiment. the number of orfs that corresponded to known cds was  <dig>  and nine orfs were found to be cds candidates that were unrecognized in the sf <dig> genome annotation .

blastp searches revealed that these nine cds candidates shared high homology  with genes that were annotated in other gas genome analyses. these nine new cdss were further annotated by sequence homology searches in the gene ontology  database. all the cds, except for orf <dig>  were assigned with go terms. three out of the nine new orfs were assigned to "cellular component" go terms, which largely agreed with the experimental evidence from the proteomic analysis .

oligopeptide permease periplasmic binding protein  and two component response regulators, csrr,  were previously found in the sf <dig> supernatants  <cit> . orf <dig> shares homology with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, which was annotated with tagged m5005_spy_ <dig> in the mgas <dig> genome . go annotation indicated that the product of orf <dig> is involved in protein folding. orf <dig> shared homology with fibronectin-binding protein, which was annotated with tagged m5005_spy_ <dig> in the mgas <dig> genome. although orf <dig> was not assigned any go terms, it was estimated to possess two membrane-spanning domains by the sosui program, and a signal sequence by the signalp program. these primary structure-based features seemed to be reasonable because the peptides assigned to orf <dig> were mainly detected in the insoluble fraction under all culture conditions  <cit> . taken together, the results suggest that the product encoded by orf <dig> is located near the outer side of the cell, probably in the cell wall. orf <dig> is homologous to a small protein with a molecular weight of  <dig> , hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which was annotated in the mgas <dig> genome. orf <dig> showed homology with a bifunctional acetaldehyde-coa/alcohol dehydrogenase , which was annotated with tagged m5005_spy_ <dig> in the mgas <dig> genome. relatively large numbers of peptide sequences  were detected in the soluble and insoluble fractions under static and co <dig> culture conditions, whereas no peptides were identified in shaking condition. orf <dig> shared homology with thioredoxin reductase, which was annotated with tagged m5005_spy_ <dig> in the mgas <dig> genome. the product of orf <dig> estimated to be involved in oxidation reduction by go annotation. orf <dig> shared homology with a relatively small molecular weight  trna-binding domain-containing protein, which was annotated with tagged m5005_spy_ <dig> in the mgas <dig> genome. orf <dig> shared homology with a relatively small molecular weight  hypothetical protein in mgas <dig> tagged with spym3_ <dig>  this small protein shared homology with part of the pyrogenic exotoxin b ; however, the peptide fragments assigned to orf <dig> in this study showed no identity with the amino acid sequence of speb .

in summary, proteomic-assisted re-annotation of the sf <dig> genome with an in-house database consist of six-frame orfs identified novel nine orfs as candidate cdss that are expressed in sf <dig> 

detection of mrnas of novel cds candidates
rt-pcr analysis of candidate cdss was used to verify the transcription of the mrnas of these genes. the results of rt-pcr were consistent with the shotgun proteomic analysis. rt-pcr amplified the mrnas of all nine candidate cdss, verifying the transcription of these genes . although some mrnas, corresponding to orf <dig> and orf <dig> under shaking conditions, were not detected by rt-pcr analysis, almost the entire mrna expression pattern was in agreement with the proteomic analysis. to amplify the mrnas derived from orf <dig> and orf <dig> under shaking conditions, we increased the number of rt-pcr cycles from  <dig> to  <dig>  however, the amplified pcr products obtained by reverse transcription of total rna samples were similar to those from the mock  control. in shaking culture condition, these mrnas may be expressed at a level that is below the detection threshold of the rt-pcr conditions used.

comparative proteomic analysis for different culture conditions
shotgun lc-ms/ms proteomic analysis revealed the expressions of  <dig> proteins out of  <dig>  cdss  under three differential culture conditions, including under atmospheric conditions with or without shaking, and under 5% co <dig> . of these  <dig> proteins,  <dig> proteins  were commonly identified under all culture conditions;  <dig> proteins  were identified under more than two culture conditions, and the remaining  <dig> proteins  were identified only under one culture condition each. in the supernatant, soluble fraction, and insoluble fraction, the number of proteins commonly identified under three different culture conditions were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. this result indicated that these commonly identified proteins comprised a core set of sf <dig> proteins, at least during the stationary phase. these results also suggested that variations in secreted proteins were more likely than for cell body-associated proteins as sf <dig> cells adapted to the environmental conditions.

functional annotations for hypothetical proteins
the proportion of "conserved hypothetical protein " or "hypothetical protein " accounts for  <dig> %  of all annotated genes in the sf <dig> genome. we assigned functional annotations to these chyp or hyp genes with lc-ms/ms shotgun proteomic analysis. in this study, we identified the products of  <dig> chyp  and  <dig> hyp  genes, respectively . to update the annotations for these hypothetical genes, we divided these chyp and hyp genes into expression pattern groups based on the cell fraction and culture conditions. we assumed that the cellular fraction would reflect a protein's location in bacterial culture. for example, a protein that was identified only in the supernatant should be categorized into the secreted protein group, or a protein that was identified in the soluble and insoluble fractions, but not in the supernatant, should be categorized in the whole cell-associated group. more than twice the number of assigned unique peptide sequences was used for these criteria to estimate the protein expression pattern. these  <dig> hypothetical proteins were classified on the basis of their cellular locations as follows:  <dig> cytoplasmic proteins,  <dig> cell wall-associated proteins,  <dig> secreted proteins,  <dig> whole cell-associated proteins, two cytoplasmic and secreted proteins, and four universally located proteins. spy <dig>  which was estimated to possess two membrane spanning domains and a relatively high signal peptide score , showed a tendency to be located near the outer side of the cell, rather than in the cytoplasmic fraction. the expression profiles based on culture conditions were also similarly classified into groups. twenty-five proteins were expressed only under static conditions. thirteen proteins were expressed only under 5% co <dig> conditions. twenty proteins were expressed only under shaking conditions. ten proteins were expressed under both static and co <dig> conditions. seven proteins were expressed under both static and shaking conditions. fifteen proteins were expressed under co <dig> and shaking conditions, and  <dig> proteins were expressed under all three culture conditions. the product encoded by spy <dig>  which was identified in the insoluble fraction under atmospheric culture conditions with or without shaking, was consistent with the annotation for a chyp that was "possibly involved in cell wall localization and side chain formation of rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide". three hypothetical proteins, spy <dig>  spy <dig>  and spy <dig>  were identified under static culture conditions. these three proteins were included in a specific prophage region associated with sf <dig> and its related strains  <cit> . spy <dig> and spy <dig> were included in φsp <dig> , and the virulence factors spec and mf <dig> were encoded in this prophage region. spy <dig> was included in φsf <dig> , and the virulence factors spei and speh were encoded in this prophage region.

to extensively annotate these hypothetical proteins, go terms, estimation for membrane spanning domains , and signal sequence for secretion  were integrated . three classes of go terms, cellular component, biological process, and molecular function were assigned to  <dig> hypothetical proteins; however,  <dig> proteins could not be linked to any go terms.

discussion
comprehensive molecular biological approaches, such as transcriptome or proteome analysis, are essential for understanding the phenomenon of infection caused by virulent organisms, including gas. most post-genomic analysis is undertaken based on annotations derived from genome research. however, as mentioned above, previous genome analysis identified a number of "hypothetical proteins" that possibly represent unrecognized cdss. typical genome analysis is performed using a search procedure based on similarities. a query sequence derived from a list of orfs in a genome is searched against a database comprising known amino acid sequences. these databases, such as ncbinr, have increased in size exponentially. several genomes were re-evaluated semi-automatically with developed programs for gene identification  <cit> . in an intra-species genomic overview of s. pyogenes, gene prediction was largely divided into two groups depending on whether the gene predictor ergo was used or not   <cit> . genes were predicted by ergo in seven out of  <dig> s. pyogenes genome analyses, with an average cds coverage  <dig> % in the genome and an average length of protein coding gene of  <dig> bp. on the other hand, other gene prediction programs were used in the other five analyses, generating an average cds coverage of  <dig> % in genome, and an average length of protein coding genes of  <dig> bp. this suggested that the ergo system predicted shorter orfs compared to other gene predictors. it could be that the ergo system over-predicted genes, whereas these genes might have been dismissed by the other gene predictors. the issue of trade-off between unrecognized orf and over-prediction of genes should be solved using experimental evidence.

in fact, methods for gene prediction have been developed, and novel cdss have been found by experimentally supported approaches  <cit> . dandekar et al. revised the mycoplasma pneumoniae genome and increased the total number of orfs from  <dig> to  <dig> by integration of a gene-identifying program and proteomic experiments  <cit> . they found  <dig> new cdss in intergenic regions, two were identified by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry, and one orf was dismissed. the public genome annotation  was revised based on this study. in pseudomonas fluorescens pf0- <dig>  kim et al. searched unrecognized genes with cell fractionation data  followed by off-line two dimensional liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry analysis  <cit> . they found  <dig> novel genes of which six were intergenic region, nine overlapped with antisense predicted genes, and one overlapped with a predicted gene in another reading flame in the same direction. payne et al., evaluated the genomes of yersinia pestis with proteomic analysis for complement genome annotation, and  <dig> other yersinia genomes in public databases were improved, including four new cdss  <cit> . one of the excellent adaptations of proteomics to genome annotation was provided for the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon, aeropyrum pernix. the number of proteins encoded by a. pernix has been the matter of some debate because of its high gc content and codon usage  <cit> . proteomic analysis of this archaeon provided useful information, including  <dig> newly identified cdss  <cit> . the results of proteomic analysis were used as a reliable index for the development of further gene annotation methods. in s. pyogenes, a number of cdss remain as " hypothetical proteins", whereas  <dig> intra-species genomes were revealed. despite the strain sf <dig> being widely used in many researchers, the annotation has remained almost the same as when it was published in the public database. we envisioned that the re-evaluation of the sf <dig> genome with proteomic experimental evidence would provide useful information.

we identified nine novel genes that were transcribed and translated in sf <dig>  based on assignments from ms/ms spectra from a list of six-frame orfs rather than a list of known cdss. two out of these nine genes were identified in our previously report  <cit> , and the transcriptions of both of these genes were verified by rt-pcr . oppa is believed to be a lipoprotein associated with virulence in mice  <cit> . the oligopeptide permease complex consists of a periplasmic binding protein , two transmembrane proteins , and two membrane-associated cytoplasmic atpases  on a polycistronic operon  <cit> . csrr, also known as covr, is a unit of a two component signaling system that is associated with stressors, such as temperature, salt concentration, ph, antibiotics, and iron starvation  <cit> . in addition, the csrr/s system is known to regulate several virulence factors, such as the hyaluronic acid capsule, streptolysin s, streptokinase, and pyrogenic exotoxin b   <cit> . the cds in orf <dig> encodes a fibronectin binding protein with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, and is believed to be involved in adhesion to the host cell surfaces. although two other fibronectin binding proteins, spy <dig> and spy <dig>  were annotated in sf <dig>  neither of them could be detected in our proteome analysis. orf <dig> contains a cds that encodes a  <dig>  kda enzyme that is considered to be a bifunctional acetaldehyde-coa/alcohol dehydrogenase . four genes encoded by novel orfs are believed to possess relatively low molecular weights; orf <dig> , orf <dig> , orf <dig> , and orf <dig> . the full length of orf <dig> is corresponds to  <dig> amino acid residues. although the homologous orf was previously determined in mgas <dig>  the annotation for orf <dig> in sf <dig> has been omitted, probably because of its short length.

unexpectedly, relatively few  genes/novel cdss were discovered in the sf <dig> genome, which possesses approximetely <dig> fewer cdss compared to other gas genomes. the number of new cdss was comparable with previous reports  <cit> . in this study, two or more ms/ms spectra matching a unique peptide sequence in an orf were used as the criterion for protein identification. although the main goal of this study was a precise re-evaluation of sf <dig> genomes, this criterion may be too strict for the short length orfs. the criteria that the identification of a protein was judged by one ms/ms spectrum matching to a unique peptide sequence will be considerable for the screening of unidentified cds using a six-frame database. alternatively, we suggest that an analysis that integrates proteomics and tiling dna arrays should identify more of the short-length unrecognized orfs. although it would be easy to find unrecognized genes in a genome by several in silico strategies, such as intra-species genome comparison or searching with go annotation, further experimental verification by the presence of mrna or proteins encoded the genes is important. proteomics-driven re-annotation with a six-frame database allows the identification of unrecognized genes with verification of the gene products at the same time.

the other aim of this study was to experimentally characterize hypothetical genes in gas and to re-annotate hypothetical proteins by comprehensive analysis. transcriptomic and/or proteomic analysis to generate functional annotations for hypothetical genes has been widely applied to many living organisms  <cit> . this assignment generated functional annotations for  <dig> cdss  in desulfovibrio vulgaris,  <dig> cdss  in shewanella oneidensis, and  <dig>  in the haemophilus influenza genome  <cit> . in the sf <dig> genome, approximately 40% of proteins had been annotated as "hypothetical" or "conserved hypothetical" proteins. we identified  <dig> hypothetical proteins in three cellular fractions under three different culture conditions. proteomics-driven functional annotation can help to not only deduce the response of cells under stressful culture conditions, as in transcriptome analysis, but can also be used to deduce the cellular location of protein expression  <cit> . the absolute quantification of proteins should establish the number of peptide sequences that are detected under each culture condition, and whether the cellular fractions reflect the abundance of a particular protein  <cit> . furthermore, the homology search-based annotation, including go, signalp, and sosui, were integrated into proteomic experimental evidence of the annotation for unrecognized proteins. this integrated functional annotation provided interesting information for unknown proteins. for example, spy <dig> was assigned to the "cell" go term and had a signalp score  <dig> . this protein was only identified from the insoluble fraction, and was expressed at a relatively high abundance in the static and co <dig> culture conditions rather than under shaking conditions, by the proteomic analysis. it is speculated that the product of spy <dig> may be located in the cell membrane or cell wall, may be associated with the sec pathway, and be upregulated under non-shaking culture conditions. another example is spy <dig>  which was assigned the go terms "cell envelope", "external encapsulating structure", "transport", and "transporter activity", was estimated to have one membrane spanning domain by sosui, and had a signalp score  <dig> . the product of spy <dig> was universally observed in all cellular fractions, and was relatively highly expressed under shaking culture conditions. it is speculated that spy <dig> is secreted via the sec pathway and is involved in transport of substances, especially under shaking culture conditions, which mimics mechanical or oxygenic stress. other interesting examples were spy <dig> and spy <dig>  which were identified with relatively high numbers of ms/ms spectra, despite both of them being assigned no go terms. they should merit further biochemical and biological investigation.

a high degree of protein variation was observed in the supernatant compared to the insoluble and soluble fractions of the cell . our previous reports suggested that stressors, such as addition of antibiotics  <cit> , influenced the expressions of extracellular proteins. these results suggest that gas cells change their expression patterns of extracellular proteins when adapting to environmental stresses. in contrast to extracellular proteins, core proteins were easily identified in cell-body fractions under the different culture conditions. it is hypothesized that the protein components that we observed were a consequence of growth during the stationary phase of the cultures. for example, a previous report indicated that the effect of different culture atmospheres modulated surface structures. bisno et al. reported that the expression level of the m protein of the cell wall-associated fraction was greater in 5% co <dig> culture conditions  <cit> . our results also confirmed this hypothesis . interestingly, the highest amounts of m protein in the supernatant were observed under shaking culture conditions. we speculate that the m protein is detached from the cell wall because of the mechanical effects of shaking, although this should be investigated further.

CONCLUSIONS
the proteome of s. pyogenes sf <dig> was characterized by shotgun lc-ms/ms with a non-biased, six-frame translation of open reading frames of the actual genome sequence. in this study, nine proteins were discovered as novel orfs in sf <dig>  with the validation of their corresponding mrnas. furthermore, functional annotation was obtained for  <dig> hypothetical proteins . to elucidate the dynamic responses of gas cells to the environment requires more extensive analysis, which can compare proteomic profiles for different culture conditions, such as atmospheric compositions, culture media, growth phases, temperature, mechanical stress, and the addition of antibiotics. although effort has been made to illustrate the proteomic profiles of s. pyogenes, several proteins may be inadequately evaluated because of unrecognized cdss in genomes, or the absence of well-characterized annotations, such as for hyps and chyps. notably, the selection of a reliable database, such as six-frame amino acid sequences derived from actual genome dna sequences, should be used to ensure reliable proteomic analysis.

the re-evaluation of a genome by proteomic evidence is useful; however, not all the proteins could be identified in a series of experiments because they may not all be expressed at the same time, or because of technical problems. the integrated evaluation of genomes with the proteomic and transcriptomic analysis, and similarity-based bioinformatics analysis could provide more reliable and useful annotations.
