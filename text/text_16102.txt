BACKGROUND
polyploidy or whole genome duplication  has occurred multiple times throughout the evolutionary history of plants. it has long been recognized as a major force in angiosperm evolution, plant speciation and diversification  <cit> . polyploidization is both an ancient and an ongoing evolutionary process  <cit>  and has played a role in the adaptation of a wide range of crops to different environments by generating phenotypic variation. polyploids are generally divided into two categories; autopolyploids from duplication of the same genome; and allopolyploids from hybridization of two diverged genomes with subsequent genome duplication. these distinctions are less clear in paleopolyploids. soybean  <cit>  and maize  <cit>  are considered to be paleopolyploids having been formed between  <dig> –  <dig> mya. both show evidence of diploidization, an ongoing process by which a newly formed polyploid becomes stabilized, involving the loss of duplicated genes, thereby returning the genome to a diploid-like form  <cit> . both potato and alfalfa are derived through autopolyploidy, while wheat, oat, cotton, coffee and oilseed rape have allopolyploidy in their evolutionary history. trapogoyon is a young allopolyploid species that has formed multiple times over the last 80 years  <cit>  and so offers the opportunity to study a natural allopolyploid which is sympatric with its parental species  <cit> . the success of newly formed angiosperm polyploids is partly attributable to their highly plastic genome structure. recent studies have documented rapid and dynamic changes in genomic structure and gene expression in plant polyploids. much of the functional plasticity in polyploids is correlated with gene expression changes at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. such gene expression changes are controlled largely by epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> .

the brassica species include an important group of vegetable and oil crops and their genomes have complex evolutionary histories. a major focus for research has been brassica napus . this is an allopolyploid species formed by the hybridization of progenitor species brassica rapa  and brassica oleracea . the brassica species in general, and b. napus in particular, provide an excellent system in which to study the impacts of polyploidy and the processes by which genomes subsequently stabilize. b. rapa and b. oleracea are closely related, having diverged around  <dig>  mya  <cit> . the b. napus types cultivated as crops arose from natural polyploid formation, probably during human cultivation, i.e. less than  <dig>  years ago. genetic mapping studies confirmed that the progenitor a and c genomes are essentially intact in natural lines of b. napus and have not been substantially rearranged  <cit> . it is also possible to make newly constructed  polyploids in the laboratory by crossing b. rapa and b. oleracea accessions and doubling chromosomes . song et al. <cit>  used resynthesised polyploids to study genome evolution in the early generations after polyploidization and demonstrated that polyploid species can generate extensive genetic diversity in a short period of time. pires et al. <cit>  were interested in the ability of polyploids to possess novel traits that are not present in their diploid progenitors which has allowed polyploids to successfully enter new ecological niches. focussing on flowering time they showed evidence of chromosomal rearrangements and changes in gene expression, which partially explained the phenotypic variation in b. napus. the mechanisms for chromosome stability and diploidization in polyploids remain largely unknown but a study of  <dig> resynthesised lines of b. napus showed that in the first generation  of resynthesised b. napus, genetic changes are rare but cytosine methylation changes are frequent, whereas in later generations  genetic changes are much more frequent, but the s  <dig> methylation remained fixed  <cit> . the genetic changes observed in resynthesised b. napus are not random and there is evidence that many are the consequence of homoeologous recombination  <cit> . recent cytological investigations including a s 10: <dig> generation showed that changes in copy number of individual chromosomes increased with successive generations; they showed gross chromosomal rearrangements and that dosage balance mechanisms enforced chromosome number stability  <cit> . there is much interest on how these genetic and epigenetic changes contribute to changes in gene expression. transcriptional changes are likely to be a critical component of polyploid evolution as they can contribute directly to novel phenotypes. most studies have compared gene expression in resynthesised polyploid lines to expression in their parents to provide evidence of additive or non-additive gene expression. according to the "additivity hypothesis”, newly-synthesized allopolyploids are supposed to display mid-parental expression patterns. many exceptions are found in resynthesised allopolyploids e.g. arabidopsis <cit> , senecio <cit> , brassica <cit> , triticum <cit> , and gossypium <cit> , suggesting that the differential regulation of gene expression is a common feature of plant allopolyploids. although the phenomenon of non-additive expression in inter-specific hybrids and allopolyploids is now well described, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. recent studies have used statistical methods to predict the contribution of each parent to gene expression in the polyploid using genome-wide microarrays that are not able to distinguish between expression of homoeologous pairs  <cit> . the “additivity” hypothesis was confirmed using comparative proteomics on newly resynthesised b. napus <cit> . identification using mass spectrometry and functional categorisation of the differentially regulated proteins did not show that any functional category, metabolic pathway or subcellular localization was over- or under represented within non-additive polypeptides  <cit> . comparing transcript levels in resynthesised b. napus to protein levels showed that differential protein regulation is not explained by transcriptional changes  <cit> . this is a complex process so another approach has been to measure transcript levels of homoeologous pairs of genes, but not transcriptome-wide. for example, dong et al. <cit>  showed a complex pattern of differential expression in response to abiotic stress in both natural and resynthesised allopolyploid gossypium hirsutum using sscp-cdna gels to distinguish homoeologous pairs of  <dig> genes. also, chaudhary et al. <cit>  used a mass-spectrometry-based snp detection technique to measure allele- and homoeologue-specific contributions to the transcriptome of diploid and allopolyploid cotton and showed that 40% of homoeologues were transcriptionally biased in at least one stage of cotton development. development of a method to measure genome-wide differential expression of homoeologous pairs using transcriptome sequencing in both synthetic and natural polyploids would contribute to our understanding of this complex process.

next generation sequencing technologies  have opened exciting opportunities to study genomes and transcriptomes of plant species with and without sequenced genomes. many crop genome projects are ongoing, including oilseed rape, bread wheat and banana, but many of these polyploid plants have complex genome structures meaning that producing a draft sequence is challenging  <cit> . meanwhile plant transcriptomics using ngs can yield much information on crops  <cit> , including gene discovery, transcript quantification, post-transcriptional regulation and linking genotypes to phenotypes  <cit> . mrna-seq is a recently developed approach to transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies  <cit> . previous experiments, using mrna-seq for snp detection in b. napus <cit> , have proved illumina sequencing to be an efficient method. mrna-seq can also be used as a method to estimate transcript abundance. the first step is to map the reads to the genome or transcriptome, and then the number of reads aligning to a specific region of the reference sequence is counted and subjected to relevant normalisation procedures  <cit> . it is anticipated that mrna-seq will revolutionize the manner in which eukaryotic transcriptomes are analysed  <cit>  as sequencing-based approaches have clear advantages over hybridization-based approaches for quantifying the transcriptome. a range of studies comparing microarray and mrna-seq have consistently shown that sequencing has higher sensitivity and dynamic range  <cit> , although reproducibility has been shown to depend on the type of sample studied  <cit>  and a recent study has shown that technical variability is too high to be ignored  <cit> .

we previously developed a set of  <dig>  brassica unigenes, by assembly of all available brassica ests, and used this set for the design of a brassica microarray  <cit> . we used this for the analysis of gene expression in resynthesised b. napus lines . these resynthesised b. napus lines shared the same parental combinations of b. rapa  and b. oleracea , but from reciprocal crosses. the brassica unigenes were assembled using parameters that enabled the separate assembly of transcripts of paralogous genes within each diploid brassica genome  but the co-assembly of transcripts of homoeologous genes . the surface-bound oligonucleotide probes of the microarrays were designed to regions that differed most between unigenes , so discriminate well between unigenes representing paralogous genes, but they have no capability to discriminate between homoeologous genes.

in the present study, we report the development of methodology for using mrna-seq to quantify transcript abundance in polyploids, with estimation of the relative contributions of homoeologous genes. as a proof of concept, we analysed mrna from reserved aliquots of the same ground leaf samples taken from the resynthesised b. napus plants used in our  <dig> microarray-based study. we show, inter alia, that mrna-seq can be used successfully for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of gene expression and for the apportioning of transcript abundance to a and c genomes in both resynthesised and natural b. napus.

RESULTS
comparison of microarray and mrna-seq for transcript quantification
for the first stage of the evaluation of mrna-seq, we used the sequences of the original  <dig>  brassica unigenes as the reference sequence  for the alignment of illumina mrna-seq reads using maq  <cit>  . an average of  <dig>  million raw  <dig> base reads was generated per sample. these sequences were of high quality: the mean phred-like quality value at base  <dig> was q <dig>  and the mean base position at which it declined below q <dig> was  <dig> . across the four biological replicates of b. napus  <dig>  an average of  <dig>  million reads  were mapped to an average of  <dig>  unigenes in the aligned naive reference with a mean depth of coverage of  <dig> -fold. similarly for b. napus  <dig>  an average of  <dig>  million reads  were mapped to an average of  <dig>  unigenes with mean depth of  <dig> -fold. the details are shown in table  <dig>  qualitative analyses of gene expression were conducted for both b. napus  <dig> and b. napus  <dig>  unigenes were called as expressed if they had one or more reads aligning in all four replicates and were called as non-expressed if they had zero counts in all four replicates .  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were called as expressed for b. napus  <dig> and b. napus  <dig> respectively, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were called as non-expressed. these results were compared with the calling of unigenes as expressed or non-expressed using the microarray  <cit> . a comparison of the complements of classified unigenes is shown in figure  <dig>  the largest class of unigenes is that for which expression has been called by both microarray and mrna-seq. although some unigenes were called as expressed by microarray only, more than three times as many were called as expressed by mrna-seq only. this observed greater sensitivity of mrna-seq is consistent with previous reports  <cit>  and has been attributed to the very low, if any, background signal present in mrna-seq, enabling detection of low levels of expression. our observation of extensive overlap between genes called as expressed by both microarray and mrna-seq is also consistent with the results of studies in other species  <cit> .

for the second stage of the evaluation, we compared transcript quantification by microarrays and mrna-seq. for the unigenes called as expressed by both mrna-seq and microarrays , we quantified and normalized transcript abundance  for mrna-seq, absolute intensities for microarray). these showed good correlation for both b. napus  <dig> and b. napus  <dig> , as shown in figure  <dig>  this degree of correlation is consistent with the results of previous studies using two-colour agilent microarrays  <cit> . our analysis was conducted across the entire range of measured transcript abundance  demonstrating that good correlation can be detected beyond just the medium abundance range shown previously  <cit> . the combination of the wider dynamic range of mrna-seq, in addition to its previously reported ability to provide a better estimate of absolute expression levels  <cit> , confirms mrna-seq as the preferred methodology for transcript quantification.

modifying the reference sequence to improve read alignment
the unigene assemblies are derived from sequences originating from multiple cultivars and even multiple genomes, so may differ from any actual transcript sequences. if the number of mismatches between an individual illumina read and the most similar unigene in the naive reference sequence is too great, it will not map. in order to increase the proportion of sequence reads that map, the reference sequence can be corrected, to more closely represent the two genomes present in the polyploid. in the case of b. napus, the improved reference sequence, which we term “cured” can be produced by separately curing the naive reference with b. rapa mrna-seq reads and b. oleracea mrna-seq reads so that the unigene variants more closely represent transcripts from the a and c genomes respectively. as the curing process is expected to progressively allow the mapping of additional reads, the process should be conducted iteratively over a number of cycles. an initial version of this process has been reported previously  <cit> . however, we improved upon this by splitting the available  <dig> base illumina reads from b. rapa and b. oleracea to  <dig> x  <dig> base reads. this allowed mapping of reads to regions of reference sequence with higher divergence. we applied the curing process iteratively over six cycles, using  <dig> , <dig> reads for b. rapa and  <dig> , <dig> reads for b. oleracea. the curing process is shown schematically in figure  <dig> for the a genome at cycles  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the number of reads mapped after each round of curing is shown in figure  <dig> and the cumulative number of bases cured is shown in figure  <dig>  the resulting b. rapa-cured and b. oleracea-cured reference sequences contained  <dig>  and  <dig>  base differences from the naive reference, respectively . nevertheless, there were  <dig>  base differences , within  <dig>  unigenes, between the b. rapa-cured  and b. oleracea-cured  unigene sequences. these differences represent inter-homoeologue polymorphisms . the number of ihps per unigene in this subset of  <dig>  unigenes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  as the unigenes are of different lengths, the density of ihps identified in the unigenes was calculated. the frequency distribution is illustrated in figure  <dig>  although most unigenes have a low density of ihps, with the mean being  <dig>  ihps per kb, a few had high frequencies, with a maximum of  <dig>  ihps per kb.

the b. rapa-cured and b. oleracea-cured unigene sequences were simply combined to produce the cured reference sequence, which thus comprised the a and c genome variants for each unigene . sequences  from the  <dig> biological replicates of b. napus  <dig> and b. napus  <dig> were re-mapped to the cured reference. the results are shown in table  <dig>  starting with an average of  <dig>  million raw reads for b. napus  <dig>  an average of  <dig>  million reads aligned to a genome versions of the unigenes and an average of  <dig>  million reads aligned to the c genome versions of the unigenes , this represented a total number of reads aligning to the cured reference of an average of  <dig>  million reads with a mean depth of coverage of the aligned reference of  <dig> -fold, which is an increase of an average of  <dig>  million reads  compared to the naive reference. similar results were obtained for b. napus  <dig>  which showed a  <dig> % increase in the number of mapped reads. these results confirmed that the curing process was highly successful in enabling the mapping of a greater proportion of sequence reads from the resynthesised b. napus. the b. rapa-cured and b. oleracea-cured unigene sequences will be of value for exploiting mrna-seq for transcript quantification in these species. the large number of ihps differentiating the unigenes in the cured reference  also provides the opportunity to estimate the relative contributions to the transcriptome of homoeologues in the a and c genomes.

estimation of the relative contributions of homoeologues to the transcriptome
the mapping to the cured reference of sequences from the four biological replicates of b. napus  <dig> and b. napus  <dig> results in the assignment of each sequence read to the unigene with the fewest mismatches. where maq finds equally probable matches, the read is assigned randomly to one of them. consequently, the cured reference provides the opportunity to estimate the relative contributions to the transcriptome of homoeologues based on this apportioning of reads, but with an anticipated underestimation of differences between the contributions of homoeologues in the a and c genomes where there are tracts of identical sequence in the corresponding unigenes in the cured reference.

to assess whether mrna-seq could be used to detect quantitative differences between the abundance of transcripts originating from the a and c genomes of resynthesised b. napus, we analysed the numbers of reads mapped to each version  of the unigenes in the cured reference. using the separate rpkm values for alignment to the a genome-cured and c genome-cured versions of each unigene as paired values for each of the four replicates of b. napus  <dig> and b. napus  <dig>  we were able to identify homoeologous pairs of genes for which the a and c genome versions show significant differences in transcript abundance. plots of the transcript abundance measured for the a and c genome versions of unigenes are shown in figure  <dig> for each of b. napus  <dig> and b. napus  <dig>  with unigenes showing significant  differences between the genome versions highlighted. in all,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  unigenes containing ihps showed differential expression  between the a and c genome homoeologues in both b. napus  <dig> and b. napus  <dig>  with  <dig>  showing higher expression in the a genome homoeologue and  <dig>  showing higher expression in the c genome homoeologue. this set of unigenes was enriched for ihps . the success of mapping sequence reads to a reference sequence cured to better represent the genomes of ancestral species demonstrates the feasibility of using mrna-seq to apportion transcript abundance to the constituent genomes of polyploids, at least for genes in which sufficient ihps serve to differentiate homoeologues.

to test whether our method for the apportioning of transcript abundance to genomes is also applicable to natural b. napus, we generated leaf mrna-seq data from five cultivars representing differing crop types. the sequence datasets consisted of between  <dig> and  <dig> million raw reads, the mean phred-like quality value at base  <dig> was q <dig>  and the mean position at which the quality value declined below q <dig> of  <dig> . the sequence reads were mapped to both the naive reference and the cured reference. as was observed with mrna-seq reads from the resynthesised b. napus, more sequences were mapped to the cured reference than to the naive reference, as summarised in table  <dig>  however, the increase for natural b. napus of  <dig> %, was lower than that observed for resynthesised b. napus . the difference is likely to be due to the curing process having used sequences from the precise progenitors of the resynthesised b. napus, resulting in optimum read mapping, whereas the actual progenitors of the natural b. napus types are unknown. we observed consistent  biases in the proportions of reads mapping to the a and c genome versions of unigenes for both resynthesised b. napus  and natural b. napus . this may be a consequence of the transcriptome sequence of b. oleracea a12dh being more similar to that of the c genome ancestor of natural b. napus than the transcriptome sequence of b. rapa r-o- <dig> is to that of the a genome ancestor of natural b. napus, which has been observed previously for some regions of the genome  <cit> .

we were also interested in identifying unigenes which were consistently differentially expressed across all the five b. napus cultivars. we used the rpkm values for alignment to the a genome-cured and c genome-cured versions of each unigene as paired values to identify homoeologous pairs of genes for which the a and c genome versions showed differences in transcript abundance across all five cultivars. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  with unigenes showing significant  differences between the genome versions highlighted. in all,  <dig>  unigenes showed differential expression  between the a and c genome homoeologues, with  <dig>  showing higher expression in the a genome homoeologue and  <dig>  showing higher expression in the c genome homoeologue. this set of unigenes was enriched for ihps . this demonstrates the applicability of using mrna-seq to apportion transcript abundance to the constituent genomes of natural polyploids.

analysis and functional classification of homoeologous unigene pairs showing differential transcript abundance
in order to assess the consistency between b. napus  <dig>  b. napus  <dig> and natural b. napus for the inferred differential contributions to the transcriptome from a and c genome homoeologues, we analysed the lists of unigenes identified as differentially expressed and grouped them as shown in figure  <dig>  there were many instances of differential transcript abundance represented in more than one b. napus type. a total of  <dig>  unigenes showed higher abundance from the a genome in b. napus  <dig>  of these,  <dig>  were in common with b. napus  <dig> and  <dig> showed consistent higher abundance across all five varieties of natural b. napus. a similar pattern was observed for unigenes showing higher abundance in the c genome  except that we found a higher number differentially expressed in natural b. napus . focussing on unigenes which were differentially expressed in both resynthesised and natural b. napus, we found that  <dig> unigenes were differentially expressed in both, with higher abundance in the a genome. interestingly, a further  <dig> were differentially expressed in both, but showed higher abundance in the c genome of natural b. napus giving a total of  <dig> unigenes. similarly for unigenes showing higher abundance in the c genome of resynthesised b. napus, there were  <dig> in common with the c genome of natural b. napus and  <dig> in common with the a genome of natural b. napus giving a total of  <dig>  thus giving a total of  <dig> unigenes differentially expressed in all. a functional classification of these  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes  was carried out using the agrigo web-based singular enrichment analysis   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a comparison of the input list, compared to a background of the  <dig>  unigenes that contained ihps. significant over-representation was found in go categories within cellular process and metabolic process. categories associated with biological regulation such as signalling and transcription regulator activity appear to be under-represented but this is not significant. this functional analysis of unigenes which are differentially expressed shows over-representation of categories which are not significantly over-retained in polyploids  <cit> . according to the “gene balance hypothesis”  <cit> , genes whose products function in multi-subunit complexes or signalling cascades will tend to be dosage sensitive because changes in the stoichiometry of individual subunits lead to improper assembly and/or function. these dosage sensitive genes include those involved in biological regulation such transcription factors and members of signal transduction pathways, these genes show “non-additive” expression and are typically retained in duplicate in polyploids  <cit> . genes encoding products with few interactions have fewer constraints on their expression levels so would be more likely to become differentially expressed between homoeologous gene pairs. this flexibility in their expression levels may contribute to the immediate evolutionary advantage of polyploidy.

CONCLUSIONS
our investigations have shown that mrna-seq represents an excellent approach to the analysis of both qualitative and quantitative transcript abundance in b. napus. the increased sensitivity and dynamic range compared with a corresponding analysis using microarrays, along with the good  correlation of transcript abundance quantification is consistent with the results of previous studies conducted using organisms with simpler genomes. as the cost to sequence a sample is now comparable to the cost to conduct a microarray analysis and software tools are available to manage and mine mrna-seq data, we conclude that mrna-seq will frequently be the method of choice.

our studies have shown that mrna-seq data can be used to overcome a key problem in polyploid species: the presence of homoeologous genes with very similar sequence being transcribed from each genome. by “curing” the reference unigene sequences so they more closely represent the sequences of the two genomes contained in b. napus, we have been able to allocate, on a genome-wide basis, transcript abundance to the individual genomes. although limited to regions of unigenes in which inter-homoeologue polymorphisms occur, such regions are in the majority and the approach identified many homoeologous transcripts with differential expression from the two genomes. this approach should be generally applicable to polyploid species, so long as diploid representatives of the constituent genomes are available to support the curing process. moreover, the identification of large numbers of genes with such transcription biases, in replicated experiments, demonstrates that stable homoeo-allelic variation for transcript abundance is common in b. napus.

this method also enabled us to successfully study differential expression of homoeologous genes across a range of natural b. napus crop varieties. for many genes, the ancestral profiles have been partitioned between the homoeologues in a similar pattern, despite many generations of independent evolution. this is consistent with observations in other polyploids, such as cotton   <cit>  and spartina <cit> , that there are both immediate and long-term alterations in the expression of homoeologous gene pairs following polyploid formation. functional classification of genes differentially expressed between homoeologous gene pairs showed enrichment for classes not associated with gene dosage effects, consistent with the notion that such gene classes can show allelic variation for transcript abundance that might, itself, represent a class of molecular marker.
