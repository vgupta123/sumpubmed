BACKGROUND
opportunistic and invasive fungal infections have become an important cause of morbidity and mortality  <cit> . the alarming rates of emerging antifungal resistance in hospitals are major concerns to the public health and scientific communities worldwide  <cit> . the most common antifungals currently used in the treatment of mycosis have some limitations, such as toxicity  <cit> . considering all of these circumstances together has led to an urgent need for the identification of new and more effective antifungal agents.

plants provide unlimited opportunities for the isolation of new antifungal compounds because of the unmatched availability of chemical diversity  <cit> . in fact, numerous antifungal compounds have been isolated from them  <cit> . the leaves of eugenia uniflora l , known as the brazilian cherry tree or pitangueira, are used in infusions or decoctions in popular medicine to treat inflammations associated with rheumatic pains and fever, hypoglycemia, as a diuretic and to prevent stomach diseases  <cit> . the hydroalcoholic extract from leaves decreased the levels of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is believed to be involved in the development of gout  <cit>  in addition to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions  <cit> . the enzyme also has anti-diarrheal  <cit> , antihypertensive  <cit>  actions and anti-microbial properties  <cit> . the brazilian cherry tree is mentioned in the fourth edition of the brazilian pharmacopoeia  <cit> , and the leaves are on the list of medicinal plants authorized by the ministry of health  with which to prepare infusions, as seen in the brazilian resolution number  <dig>  <cit> .

oenothein b  is a macrocyclic hydrolyzable tannin dimer isolated from e. uniflora leaves and possesses antimicrobial  <cit>  and anti-tumor activities  <cit>  and anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties  <cit> . bio-guided assays with leaves from e. uniflora showed that oenb inhibited paracoccidioides growth and the accumulation of  <dig> -β-d-glucan synthase  transcripts, which synthesizes  <dig> -β-d-glucan polymer that is deposited in the fungus cell wall  <cit> .

paracoccidioides is a thermodimorphic fungus and is the etiologic agent of paracoccidioidomycosis , an important mycosis in latin america. the infection is caused by the inhalation of the fungal spores, after which the fungus is able to disseminate from the lungs through the lymphatic system or the bloodstream to any organ or system  <cit> . the initial treatment of pcm depends on the severity of the disease and may last from  <dig> to 6 months. extended periods of treatment, up to  <dig> or more years, are often necessary with a significant frequency of relapsing disease  <cit> .

several studies have been performed to investigate the transcriptional profile of the fungus in order to elucidate the mode of action of candidate drug compounds  <cit> . here, cdna libraries were constructed to obtain expressed sequences tags  of paracoccidioides. the representational difference analysis  technique was used to identify changes in the transcriptional profile of paracoccidioides in response to oenb, aiming to identify the probable mode of action of the compound in the fungus. transcript levels were also measured during the infection process. in addition, the cell wall polymer levels were examined in members of the paracoccidioides complex.

RESULTS
libraries characteristics
cell viability was measured after exposure to oenb. a viability of 75% and 85%  corresponding to the  <dig> and 180 min treatments, respectively, were chosen for rna extraction and library construction. the libraries were constructed using the rda technique, which is able to identify both up- and down-regulated differentially expressed genes between two cdna populations  <cit> . the rda experimental design included two conditions:  paracoccidioides yeast cells exposed to mcveigh morton  medium with  <dig>  m oenb for  <dig> and 180 min and  paracoccidioides yeast cells grown in mmcm medium for  <dig> and 180 min. for the up- regulated gene library construction, the first condition  was used as a tester population and the latter  as the driver population. however, for the down-regulated library construction, the former  was used as the driver population and the latter  as the tester population. subtractions were performed by incubating the driver and tester populations. the selection of the cdnas was achieved by constructing subtracted libraries in pgem-t easy, as described in the methods section.

bioinformatics results for libraries exposed to oenb
rda analysis revealed that a large number of ests  was differentially regulated in the four gene libraries constructed after oenb treatment. from the rda library of yeast cells exposed to oenb for 90 min  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down- regulated genes were identified. after pipeline analysis, the  <dig> up-regulated sequences originated  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets; the  <dig> down-regulated sequences originated  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets. the same analysis was performed for the rda library obtained from yeast exposed to oenb for 180 min;  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were identified from this library. after pipeline analysis, the  <dig> up-regulated sequences formed  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets; the  <dig> down-regulated sequences formed  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets. the ests obtained were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information  under accession numbers: libest_ <dig> paracoccidioides oenoteinb 90up library, libest_ <dig> paracoccidioides oenoteinb  <dig> down library, libest_ <dig> paracoccidioides oenoteinb  <dig> up library and libest_ <dig> paracoccidioides oenoteinb 180down library.

all of these up- and down-regulated ests after  <dig> and 180 min of exposure to oenb were compared to paracoccidioides genes in the database of the broad institute by using the blast x program. ests with e-value < 10- <dig> were considered in this analysis. all the obtained contigs and singlets were annotated by using the blast2go program. based on this annotation, the ests represented in the four libraries were grouped into the functional categories according to the classification of go. the ests were related with metabolism, energy, transcription, signal transduction, protein fate, protein synthesis, morphology, transport, cell cycle and dna processing, cell rescue, defense and virulence, functionally unclassified proteins and unclassified proteins .

a accession number at broad .

graphs were plotted to demonstrate the statistically enriched go functions with up- or down-regulated genes after exposure to the compound . the groups with the highest percentage of up-regulated genes were the unclassified proteins , transcription , functional unclassified proteins , metabolism , cell cycle and dna processing  and morphology . the highest percentage of down-regulated genes was grouped in the signal transducer , cellular transport, transport facilities and transport routes , transcription , cell rescue, defense and virulence , metabolism , unclassified proteins , protein synthesis  and morphology  groups.

the distribution of differentially expressed genes in the different functional categories and biological processes was evaluated . the analysis demonstrated that most of the genes that were down-regulated after 90 min participate in cellular processes related to transport, followed by signal transducers and those involved in transcription and metabolism. on the other hand, the up-regulated genes were mostly found to be functionally unclassified proteins, followed by unclassified proteins, and those involved in cell cycle and dna processing and metabolism. after 180 min treatment, most of the down-regulated genes were also involved in signal transduction, metabolism and cellular transport. the up-regulated genes were unclassified proteins or those involved in transcription and morphology determination. the percentage of occurrence of each gene in the libraries was indicated in the additional file 2: table s <dig> 

the oenb treatment resulted in up-and down-regulated genes involved in different biological processes . we analyzed the occurrence of the transcripts by determining the number of ests found in each transcript. the highest occurrence of up-regulated ests after 90 min of oenb treatment were as follows: duf  <dig> domain protein , arginine n-methyltransferase- skb <dig>  , gata-type sexual  , trehalose phosphatase  , histone deacetylase  , glutamine synthetase  , phosphatase regulatory subunit   and protein with a pyp-like sensor domain  . for down-regulated ests, the highest expression transcripts were the following: major facilitator superfamily transporter  , guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha- <dig> subunit   and c <dig> transcription factor  .

likewise, we analyzed the up-and down-regulated genes resulting from  <dig> min of oenb treatment and noted genes that might be involved in different biological process . the highest transcription expression of transcripts after  <dig> min of treatment were the following for up-regulated ests: transcription factor fungi , glutamine synthetase   and arp 2/ <dig> complex subunit arc <dig> . for down-regulated ests, the highest transcript expression of transcripts were the following: protein with pyp-like sensor domain  , pathogenesis associated protein  , betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase   and ring finger protein  . the most evident up- and down-regulated genes are shown in the figure  <dig> 

quantitative real-time pcr 
rda is a methodology that enriches for differentially expressed sequences within transcriptional profiles and specifically permits the detection of transcripts that are differentially represented even at low levels of expression, such as transcription factors and other regulatory genes. while representative in general terms, further confirmation of identified sequences is indicated, as in any high throughput approach, and qrt-pcr is a method of choice for this confirmation process.

consequently, we designed gene-specific primers for a set of the ests obtained from the rda libraries of paracoccidioides yeast cells treated with oenb for  <dig> and 180 min. in this set, we evaluated genes represented in the libraries by one or more ests and to genes from a different functional go category. for all seven selected genes, we obtained primer sequences that amplified specific products. some genes selected for confirmation by qrt-pcr were also assessed after 24 h of infection of macrophages by paracoccidioides. these sequences are shown in table  <dig> 

.

the expression levels of the up- and down-regulated genes from the library of yeast treated for 90 min were confirmed as significantly higher for pal <dig> and gln <dig> and significantly lower for the mfs and erg <dig> genes, compared to the controls, which was in accordance with the results from the rda methodology. all four genes from the library of yeast treatment for 180 min also corroborated the results from the rda methodology because the levels of expression were significantly higher for gln <dig> and kre <dig> and significantly lower for mfs and cap <dig> genes .

the fks <dig> gene was analyzed because we found in our previous work that the gene was repressed in the presence of oenb  <cit> . here, the decreased level of fks <dig> after  <dig> and 180 min of treatment are in agreement with our previous data.

previous studies using electron microscopy have demonstrated the formation of large vacuoles with almost no electron density, the presence of lysed cells, partial disruption of the cell wall and cytoplasmic organelle leakage out of oenob-treated paracoccidioides yeast cells  <cit> . here, genes related to osmotic stress, such as rpd <dig>  atf <dig>  hsf <dig> and gac <dig> were up-regulated in paracoccidioides yeast cells after oenb-treatment. in this way, the gac <dig> gene, which responds to osmotic stress  <cit> , was evaluated in the presence of kcl. it is noteworthy that kcl was used in this study as a stressor because it is an osmotic stress inducer and we found that it acted on the cell wall of paracoccidioides in our previous study  <cit> . our results indicated that the gac <dig> gene responds to osmotic stress because its expression level was increased in the presence of oenb and kcl .

transcript levels in oenb-treated paracoccidioides yeast cells after internalization by macrophage cells
to investigate if the transcripts identified by rda would also be up- or down- regulated in vivo, paracoccidioides yeast cells were internalized by macrophage cells and the transcript levels were then quantified. j774a. <dig> mouse macrophage cells infected with paracoccidioides were treated with oenb for 24 h, and qrt-pcr analysis was carried out for the genes kre <dig>  gln <dig>  fks and erg <dig>  the expression levels of genes found to be up- and down-regulated in the libraries of yeast cells treated for  <dig> and 180 min were confirmed. expression was significantly lower for erg <dig> and significantly higher for kre <dig> and gln <dig> after 24 h of infection. the fks <dig> gene, which was down- regulated in the presence of oenb in our previous work  <cit> , was also dow- regulated during macrophage infection . the results are in agreement with those found in the rda and qrt-pcr assays when paracoccidioides yeast cells were treated with oenb in vitro.

cell analysis by fluorescence microscopy
calcofluor white  and congo red  both stain the cell wall of fungi by binding to chitin chains  <cit> . cfw and cr dyes interact with various polysaccharides  <cit>  but exhibit a particularly high affinity for chitin  <cit> .

to investigate the chitin level in the cell wall, paracoccidioides pb <dig> and pb <dig> yeast cells were grown in liquid medium for 72 h with and without oenb, after which they were stained with calcofluor white  and congo red  and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. oenb-treated paracoccidioides cells showed a stronger fluorescence when compared to the control, indicating increased chitin levels .

carbohydrate content of the cell wall
the cell wall is divided in alkali-soluble  and alkali-insoluble  fractions according to its solubility in alkaline substances. in the paracoccidioides pb <dig> yeast phase, the glucan polymer consists mainly of  <dig> -α-glucan  which is present in the as fraction, and a small amount of the  <dig> -β-d-glucan , which is present in the ai fraction  <cit> . glcnac residues are also found in the ai fraction. figure 5a shows a decrease in total carbohydrate content in the ai fraction after oenb-treatment; no alteration in carbohydrate content was observed in the as fraction.  <dig> -β-d-glucan content was estimated after the digestion of the ai cell wall fraction with the  <dig> -β-glucanase enzyme. as shown in figure 5b, there was a decrease in  <dig> -β-d-glucan content. in addition there was an increase in glcnac residue content in this fraction , suggesting an increase in the chitin polymer concentration.

discussion
the aim of this study was to identify changes in the gene expression profile of paracoccidioides yeast cells after oenb treatment in order to investigate the adaptive cellular responses of the fungus. in the rda libraries, genes related to metabolism, energy, morphology, transcription, transport, among others were found to be differentially expressed relative to the control.

in our previous work, were visualized several events indicative of paracoccidioides cell wall collapse in the presence of oenb  <cit> . in the cdna libraries, some genes involved in the biosynthesis of the polysaccharide cell wall  and morphology  were up-regulated in oenb-treated paracoccidioides yeast cells. although the fks <dig> transcript was not found in the cdna library, the down-regulation of the fks <dig> transcript was confirmed by qrt-pcr, thus corroborating previous data  <cit> . the decreased amount of the  <dig> -β-d-glucan polymer was confirmed here after the digestion of the cell wall.

the cell wall composition of paracoccidioides varies biochemically depending on its phase. the cell wall of the yeast phase, found in infected tissue and in vitro culture at 36°c  <cit> , has more chitin polymer and less  <dig> -β-d-glucan polymer than found in the saprophytic mycelium phase. the  <dig> -α-d-glucan polymer was only found in the yeast phase  <cit> . the polysaccharide α-glucan is supposedly located in a more external region of the cell wall and is related to virulence  <cit> . both  <dig> -β-d-glucan and chitin are linked to cell wall structural function. in addition,  <dig> -β-d-glucan is an immunogenic molecule  <cit> .

glutamine synthetase  was up-regulated in oenb-treated paracoccidioides yeast. gln <dig> catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia  <cit>  and contributes glutamine to the synthesis of chitin  <cit> . here, the increase of chitin level was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. in mycobacterium bovis, gln <dig> is necessary for cell wall resistance  <cit> . in previous studies conducted with paracoccidioides, the increase in gln <dig> transcript was related to chitin deposition in response to change in external osmolarity faced by the fungus  <cit> . the increase in chitin synthase transcripts and chitin synthesis in c. albicans and a. fumigatus after treatment with antifungal agents has been shown to be an important compensatory response to cell wall stress  <cit> .

the increase in chitin synthesis has been shown to be an important compensatory response to cell wall stress. in c. albicans, increased chitin synthase gene expression has been observed after treatment with micafungin, implying that the induction of chitin synthesis might contribute to cell survival when the cell wall is damaged  <cit> . in addition the transcription levels of chsa and chsc, two chitin synthases, were increased in a. fumigatus after treatment with echinocandin  <cit> .

β-glucan synthesis associated protein  was also up-regulated in paracoccidioides after 180 min of oenb-treatment. kre and kre-related genes are required for the synthesis of cell wall  <dig> -β-glucan in s. cerevisiae <cit> . in addition, the disruption of kre <dig> reduces  <dig> -β-glucan levels  <cit> . the  <dig> -α-glucan and the genes involved in its synthesis are critical for maintaining the growth, morphology and cell wall integrity of c. neoformans <cit> .

the  <dig> -α-mannosyltransferase  gene was up-regulated in paracoccidioides after 90 min of oenb-treatment. och <dig> has many functions, including its inclusion in protein structures, its involvement in the maintenance and morphology of the cell wall and cell membrane, the synthesis of the extracellular matrix, storage of nutrients, and can also function as a ligand for cell-cell interaction  <cit> . in neurospora crassa, och <dig> is required for the incorporation of cell wall proteins into the cell wall matrix  <cit> . in yeast including s. cerevisiae, c. albicans and candida glabrata, mannan polymer  provides the strength and shape for the resistance to environmental stress  <cit> . och <dig> transcription, which is regulated by the transcription factors atf <dig>  hsf <dig>  and rpd <dig> cited above  <cit> , may synthesize mannoproteins to be deposited in the cell wall  <cit> .

mannoproteins, chitin and β- <dig> -glucan are required to maintain the cell wall and are therefore essential to cell viability  <cit> . here, several genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis were up-regulated. the fungal cell wall is an important organelle that protects the cell from various environmental stressors. it is a dynamic structure that interacts with the environment and is modified to accommodate growth, cell division, and development  <cit> . in our previous work using electronic microscopy, several hallmark changes were found, including squashing, the presence of vacuoles with low electron density, a rough surface, cell wall rupture and cell membrane recess  <cit> .

others genes related to cellular morphology were also shown to be differentially regulated, such as erg <dig> and mpv17/pmp <dig>  the c- <dig> sterol desaturase  gene was down-regulated in paracoccidioides yeast treated with oenb for 90 min. erg <dig> acts in the ergosterol biosynthesis, which is one of the most important components of fungal membrane  <cit> . it maintains the integrity and fluidity of the cell membrane  <cit>  and consequently may affect the morphology  <cit> , virulence  <cit>  and resistance of fungal pathogens  <cit> ; its biosynthetic pathway is essential for fungal growth  <cit> . the presence of cell membrane recess and folding to the inner cytoplasm initiating the formation of vacuoles was observed in oenb-treated paracoccidioides yeast cells  <cit> .

the transmembrane protein  was down-regulated in paracoccidioides after 90 min of oenb treatment. in s. cerevisiae, sym <dig>  which is homologous to mpv <dig>  is involved in the structural and functional stability of the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus controlling crucial mechanisms related to this compartment, including the activity of respiratory chain complexes, the mitochondrial morphology and the maintenance and integrity of nucleotide structures  <cit> . the leakage of cytoplasmic organelles was observed in paracoccidioides yeast cells that were treated with oenb  <cit> .

the major facilitator superfamily transporter  gene was down-regulated in oenb-treated paracoccidioides yeast. the mfs transporters include important families of membrane protein transporters which utilize diverse substrates and catalyze different modes of transport  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae and candida spp., the up-regulation of multidrug transporter genes belonging either to the abc family or to the mfs family is frequently observed in cells exposed to drugs and leads to the phenomenon of mdr   <cit> . however, there are compounds, such as fk <dig>  enniatins, milbemycins, synthetic d-octapeptides, cyclosporine, isonitrile, disulfiram, ibuprofen, and unnarmicins, that inhibit fungal abc transporters  <cit> . such inhibitors or chemo sensitizers probably act directly by affecting substrate binding and transport mediated by mdr efflux proteins  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, the natural product curcumin competitively inhibitis r6g , an mfs transporter  <cit> . clorgyline, a drug previously used as an antidepressant, was found to enhance the antifungal effect of fluconazole against azole-resistant yeast species, including c. albicans and c. glabrata strains, via the inhibition of abc and mfs fungal efflux pumps  <cit> .

although echinocandin, an antifungal acting at the fungal cell wall, provides fungicidal activity against candida spp., it is only fungistatic against aspergillus spp. <cit> . in paracoccidioides, micafungin and echinocandin are more active against mycelia than against the yeast phase  <cit> , although caspofungin can partially inhibit yeast phase growth, in different paracoccidioides isolates  <cit> . in addition, it is important to develop antifungals that are active against the yeast phase because that is the pathogenic phase  <cit> . our data indicate that oenb interferes with the paracoccidioides cell wall. because this structure is found in the fungus but not in human beings, it could be nontoxic to humans and may be an interesting antifungal prototype candidate.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the exposure of paracoccidioides to oenb results in a complex altered gene expression profile. some of the changes might represent specific adaptive responses to this compound because genes involved in the cell wall were differentially expressed, and polymer and image analysis fluorescence microscopy corroborated with transcriptome data.
