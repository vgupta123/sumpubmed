BACKGROUND
translocation of most matrix proteins to the lumen of the peroxisome depends on a signal assembled mechanism  <cit> , in which substrate proteins carrying a c-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal type  <dig>  tripeptide are translated on free ribosomes in the cytosol and recognised by the soluble receptor protein, pex5p . while the n-terminal half of pex5p has been found to be intrinsically unstructured  <cit> , the c-terminal domain of pex5p, hereafter referred to as pex5p, consists almost entirely of tandemly repeated helix-loop-helix tetratricopeptide repeats  which are commonly found as mediators of protein-protein interactions . it is this c-terminal domain that recognises pts1-bearing translocation substrates. subsequent to pex5p – pts <dig> recognition, the receptor – cargo complex docks with other proteins at the peroxisomal membrane, is internalised, the cargo dissociated, and the receptor recycled .

human pex5p has been studied previously by x-ray crystallography: bound to a consensus pts <dig> peptide , bound to a complete pts <dig> cargo protein, sterol carrier  <dig> , and in an unliganded state . the two liganded structures of pex5p are found to share an almost identical conformation but the apo-pex5p conformation is markedly different. while in pts1-liganded structures, the tpr array of pex5p is "ring-like", a more loose "snail-like" arrangement is found in apo-pex5p  <cit> .

here, we report a new crystal form of apo-pex5p, obtained in a crystallisation condition containing srcl <dig>  refinement of the crystal structure reveals a novel, previously unobserved, conformation of pex5p, further demonstrating the flexibility of the tpr array. in addition, pex5p is found to coordinate a single sr2+ ion within an inter-tpr loop, at a site that coincides with the hinge for the rigid-body movement of the two molecular halves with respect to one another. synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectropolarimetry  indicates little difference in pex5p secondary structure in the presence or absence of pts <dig> peptides, thus supporting the notion of rigid body conformational changes in solution upon cargo loading. the conformations of liganded and apo-pex5p and the presence of the sr2+ ion are discussed with reference to a set of molecular dynamic  simulations. the physiological relevance of the sr2+ ion is questionable, as proton induced x-ray emission spectroscopy  data demonstrate that pex5p has negligible affinity for sr2+ in solution – however, the sr2+ ion found in the crystal structure allows for a more detailed analysis of the propensity of this protein domain to explore conformational space.

RESULTS
structure and crystal packing
the structure of apo-pex5p in the new crystal form could not be easily solved by molecular replacement using our earlier structure  <cit>  as a model, giving the first indication of a conformational difference between the two crystal forms. however, structure solution was successful when using the two halves of pex5p as models separately . the final model, containing two pex5p molecules in the asymmetric unit, indicates that the main difference between the new structure and the previous apo-pex5p is a rigid-body movement of the two halves of the molecule with respect to each other, the hinge region being located around residue ser <dig> .

as in the previous apo-pex5p structure  <cit> , the n-terminal half of the tpr domain is less ordered than the c-terminal region. in essence, out of all protein molecules in the pex5p crystals,  <dig> % have their n-terminal half very disordered; in the present crystal form, this affects one molecule in the asymmetric unit and in the previous form, two.

for both apo-pex5p crystal forms,  <dig> % of the protein molecules are well defined in electron density, except for a gap containing a part of the tpr <dig> segment. in the remaining pex5p molecules, the tpr segments 5– <dig> and the c-terminal helical bundle are well defined, whereas the n-terminal tpr domains 1– <dig> could only be modeled approximately. there is, however, no evidence to support the unfolding of considerable parts of the tpr segments. previous  <cit>  and current  circular dichroism data show that the secondary structure contents of both the liganded and unliganded receptor conformations are almost identical. the highly flexible arrangement of tpr segments 1– <dig> in every other pex5p molecule found in both of the apo-pex5p crystal forms suggests that there may be even more conformational freedom than that observed in the available crystal structures.

the maximum difference in atomic coordinates between the two apo-structures is in the range of  <dig> Å, which is of approximately the same magnitude as seen between the apo- and liganded structures  <cit> . a movie made from the two conformations  shows that the difference seems to be caused by a sliding movement between the two halves, without any significant closing motions.

the two pex5p monomers in the asymmetric unit are related by a dyad axis. the total buried surface area, calculated by subtracting the accessible surface area of the dimer from the summed accessible areas of the monomers, is  <dig> Å <dig> at the interface; this is by far the largest area contact within the crystal lattice. interestingly, the previous apo crystal form also shows the packing of such apparent dimers within the crystal lattice, while the rest of the crystal packing is completely different. the sr2+-binding loop points towards neighbouring molecules, but the sr2+ ion is not directly involved in crystal contacts. it is possible that in addition to the hinge movement centered around the sr2+ ion binding site , the rigidification of the loop  plays a role in the formation of the new crystal form.

comparison with previous pex5p crystal structures
analysis of domain motions between the currently available pex5p structures using the program dyndom  <cit>  demonstrates that, regardless of whether the pts <dig> ligand is the yqskl consensus peptide  <cit>  or scp <dig> protein  <cit> , no potential motions can be found in liganded pex5p, and the overall structure remains essentially invariant, with a whole protein backbone root mean square deviation  best fit of  <dig>  Å <dig>  however, analysis of pex5p loaded with scp <dig>  <cit>  with apo-pex5p reveals significant motions, summarised in table  <dig>  motions between holo-pex5p and both apo-pex5p conformations are, overall, rather similar, with whole protein backbone rmsds of  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å <dig>  residues 337–518/ <dig> comprising the fixed rigid body  from the start of tpr <dig> to the end of tpr5). a rotation of the mobile rigid body ) of approximately 20°, centered around the loop connecting tpr <dig> with tpr <dig>  is observed with respect to the fixed rigid body. a significant closure motion of 80–90%, as reported by dyndom, occurs between either apo-pex5p to holo-pex5p, representing the previously described ''snail-like'' to ''ring-like'' conformational change  <cit> . however, all of these motional similarities between the two apo-pex5p with holo-pex5p do not exclude domain motions between the two apo-pex5p states . the closure motion between the two apo-states is absent; nonetheless, an interdomain twist of  <dig> °, centered at tpr <dig> is observed. thus, both apo-pex5p conformations can be considered similarly ''snail-like'' with respect to holo-pex5p, and the apparent rotation axis relating the two conformations is parallel to the line connecting the centers of mass of the rigid domains.

from the above results, it can be concluded that a similar movement is required for going from both apo conformations to the liganded conformation. on the other hand, the rotation relating the two apo structures is completely different. these results are visualised in figure 2avia the principal dynamic rotation axes, as reported by dyndom. the slightly different directions of closure motions required for each apo-pex5p state to accommodate the pts <dig> ligand  suggest that pex5p exists in a pre-existing equilibrium set of conformations allowing sufficient accessibility for pts <dig> binding.

at the pts1-binding site, the rigid-body movement between the liganded conformation and either of the two apo structures disrupts central interactions and pulls apart residues involved in pts <dig> binding . essentially, the tight cavity surrounding the pts <dig> motif is opened up in the apo forms. diagnostic to the conformational change is the disruption of the salt bridge formed between arg <dig> of tpr <dig> and glu383/glu <dig> of tpr <dig> 

examining superimpositions of all available pex5p structures reveals interesting features in the location of the 7c-loop and the n-terminal coiled segment . the 7c-loop, between tpr <dig> and the c-terminal helical bundle of pex5p, has previously been demonstrated to be a determinant in efficient pex5p-mediated translocation of pts <dig> proteins  <cit> . this 7c-loop is clearly resolved in two of the reported structures, pex5p in complex with scp <dig>  and apo-pex5p   <cit>  but is not visible in the new apo-pex5p structure presented here or in the complex with the consensus pts <dig> peptide  <cit> . the position of the 7c-loop with the coiled segment at the n-terminus of pex5p is notably different in the presence of the scp <dig> ligand , with particular regard to its proximity with a highly taxonomically conserved  acidic motif, phe326-glu327-glu328-glu329-asn <dig>  here designated the "feeen motif". the feeen motif is visible in all structures except the pex5p/scp <dig> complex. while the feeen motif essentially contacts the 7c-loop in the liganded pex5p structures – in which the overall ring-like conformation is present – the feeen motif and 7c-loop are pulled apart in the apo-pex5p structures, to a distance of about  <dig> Å . this feature can most clearly be seen in the previous apo-structure , the one available structure in which both the 7c-loop and the feeen motif are present. the preceding segment n-terminal to the feeen motif  occupies a different position on the surface of pex5p when the protein is pts1-loaded . it is possible that the drawing together of the feeen motif and 7c-loop as a result of pts1-loading of pex5p conveys a signal to the n-terminal intrinsically unstructured  <cit>  domain of pex5p, stimulating downstream folding/modification/interactions of pex5p, for example, binding with proteins of the peroxisomal membrane docking complex, such as pex14p, which has been shown to display a higher binding affinity for cargo-loaded pex5p than apo-pex5p  <cit> . to our knowledge, in vivo analysis of the function of the feeen motif is yet to be conducted.

comparison with pex5p in solution
a hexapeptide derived from the c-terminus of human scp <dig>  pgnakl, has previously been demonstrated to bind to pex5p with kd =  <dig> ±  <dig> nm using itc  <cit> . in the same assay, the consensus peptide yqskl, previously co-crystallised with pex5p  <cit> , was found to bind with kd =  <dig> ±  <dig> nm . thermodynamic parameters governing the interactions of these two peptides with pex5p are shown in table  <dig>  both peptides bind to pex5p with 1: <dig> stoichiometry. for both peptides, binding is exothermic and enthalpy driven – the negative entropy component , or both, upon binding) is outweighed by the evolved heat, to give a favourable gibbs free energy for spontaneous binding. binding affinities of a series of variations in the yqskl peptide have previously been intensively tested by a fluorescence anisotropy assay  <cit> , revealing that yqskl has a kd value in the range of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm to  <dig> ±  <dig> nm and that the variant sequence yqakl has a slightly lower binding affinity. these results are in reasonable agreement with results presented here, and discrepancies are likely to be related to the fidelity and conditions of the assays used.

apo-pex5p was examined in solution by srcd and compared to pex5p saturated with synthetic pts <dig> peptides . as noted above, the two available liganded pex5p crystal structures  <cit>  have almost identical conformation, regardless of whether the ligand is the consensus peptide or the scp <dig> protein. scrd spectra  for pex5p in the presence of the two peptides are virtually identical, with a helical content of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, as estimated by selcon  <cit> . this value compares well with the helical content of the pex5p in complex with the consensus peptide , determined as  <dig>  % by xtlsstr  <cit> . taken together with previous data  <cit> , this indicates that the structure of pex5p in solution is very similar to that of crystalline pex5p. srcd spectra of pex5p liganded with pts <dig> peptides and apo-pex5p  demonstrate that at the secondary structure level, liganded and apo-pex5p are almost identical. two features of the α-helical spectrum result from π → π* exciton splitting – the minimum at ~ <dig> nm )  results from polarization parallel to the helical axis, while the maximum at ~ <dig> nm results from polarization perpendicular to the helical axis  <cit> . thus, the small differences in the spectra around  <dig> nm may indicate subtle differences in the α-helical structure arrangement. in summary, all our data are compatible with a model in which the two halves of pex5p are mobile, as  rigid bodies, with respect to one another, while at the same time, secondary structure content is not significantly altered between the different conformations.

the sr2+ ion binding site
crystallisation of pex5p clearly demonstrated a preference for strontium – no crystals could be grown in the presence of other divalent cations: magnesium, calcium, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, manganese, yttrium, iron, zinc, or nickel . however, upon incubation in an excess of strontium in solution and subsequent removal of free strontium by dialysis, no specific binding of the metal could be detected – an elemental analysis by pixe demonstrated the presence of a maximum of  <dig> × 10- <dig> strontium ions per molecular of protein, calibrated against the x-ray fluorescence signal from sulphur atoms present in pex5p .

the strong electron density found in the crystal structure reveals that the single sr2+ ion is coordinated by the backbone oxygen atoms of three pex5p residues – val <dig> , asp <dig> , and ser <dig>  – and by three water molecules, at sr-o distances of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  Å . examination of other sr2+ ion binding proteins deposited in the pdb  <cit>  does not suggest any clearly similar sr2+ ion binding sites, although in general, a similar coordination system, forming a tetragonal bipyramid, can be observed.

on the other hand, a search for small 3d motifs at the ebi msdmotif server  <cit>  indicates a large number of ca2+ ion binding sites found in various proteins that have a similar loop backbone conformation as seen in the sr2+ ion binding loop; the motif is called catmat <dig> in the database. one of them, that from subtilisin determined at  <dig> -Å resolution  <cit> , is shown in figure 5c for comparison. while it is possible that this loop in pex5p can bind divalent cations at low affinity, no physiological relevance for such binding can be established at the moment. the binding of sr2+ ion to the loop probably stabilises the conformation of pex5p seen in our new crystal form.

molecular dynamics simulations of apo-pex5p
in order to elucidate the putative effect of the bound sr2+ ion on the dynamic properties of pex5p, 10-ns md simulations were carried out. the starting structure was the new crystal structure of apo-pex5p described above, and two runs were performed: with and without the sr2+ ion. an overall comparison of the trajectories by means of the rmsd between them indicates clearly that the simulations take different paths, depending on the presence of sr2+ . at  <dig> ns, the rmsd reaches  <dig> Å, reaching equilibrium at approximately  <dig>  Å after  <dig> ns.

the end-point coordinates of the md simulations were analysed with respect to their similarity to experimental apo and liganded structures of pex5p. a multiple structural alignment was carried out using ssm  <cit> , and the resulting rmsd values for  <dig> cα atoms are shown in table  <dig>  while the sr2+-loaded structure remains rather close to the starting conformation, the conformation of the sr2+-depleted structure after simulation indeed most closely resembles the conformation seen in the liganded pex5p structures.

the above observation was confirmed by carrying out manual superposition of all structures , using residues 503– <dig> of the c-terminal half for superposing. clearly, the removal of sr2+ prior to simulation brings the simulation end-point very close to the liganded conformation . a supplementary file containing a quicktime movie of the superposition is also available . in line with this, dyndom analysis of domain motions between the simulation end points and the liganded pex5p coordinates indicates that no dynamic domains are found between the liganded conformation and the simulated structure in the absence of sr2+, while a closure motion of  <dig> % can be seen when using the simulated structure in the presence of sr2+. thus, overall, the md simulations suggest that the pts1-liganded conformation of pex5p is also within the conformational space that can be sampled by apo-pex5p.

CONCLUSIONS
protein transport by the pex5p receptor across the peroxisomal membrane requires conformational changes in the tpr domain towards its c-terminus. it is clear that such changes are instrumental for pts <dig> recognition and binding, and also likely for protein cargo release into the peroxisomal lumen. in order to shed further light on the mechanism, by which conformational changes occur in pex5p, we carried out extended studies on pex5p ligand binding and structure, using a variety of biophysical and theoretical methods. the results obtained complement our earlier studies on pex5p in complex with scp <dig>  <cit> , and give important new information on the structure-function relationships in pex5p.

all in all, our data strongly suggest a dynamic nature for pex5p, such that the two halves of the tpr domain preferably move as near-rigid bodies related by a single hinge around tpr <dig>  the movement relating different apo conformations to each other is different from that relating the apo conformations to the liganded form. on the other hand, unliganded pex5p closes up to adopt a "nearly liganded" conformation in md simulations, while the one having a single sr2+ ion bound does not. this indicates a role for the sr2+-binding loop in pex5p dynamics, although sr2+ is unlikely to be a physiologically relevant ligand. rather, the results suggest that the more rigid conformation of the loop induced by the bound sr2+ can restrict the movement between the two lobes of the tpr domain.

based on the current and earlier data, three regions clearly emerge as being putatively important for regulating the dynamics and ligand binding of pex5p: the 7c-loop, the feeen motif, and the sr2+-binding loop. the 7c-loop and the n-terminal region containing the feeen motif interact in the liganded state, but not in the apo conformations. on the other hand, the hinge for rigid body movement between the n- and c-terminal halves of pex5p lies in close proximity of the sr2+-binding site seen in the present crystal structure. it is possible that the interactions of these regions with other molecules in or near the peroxisomal membrane affect the ability of pex5p to bind and release its cargo properly.

to conclude, pex5p is able to adopt distinctly different conformations in its apo state. these conformations do not involve changes in secondary structure content, but can be mainly described as rigid-body movements about a single hinge, located at the sr2+ binding loop and the following helix of tpr <dig>  furthermore, pts <dig> ligand binding also occurs via near-rigid body movement of the two halves of pex5p, without detectable change in secondary structure content. the origin  for the latter movement lies in the tpr5- <dig> segment. as can be seen from our sr2+-liganded structure, it is possible that the binding of a ligand to the region comprising tpr domains 4– <dig> can affect the overall conformation of pex5p, further changing its functional properties.
