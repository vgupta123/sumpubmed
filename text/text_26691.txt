BACKGROUND
dendritic cells  are potent antigen-presenting cells  that bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses through direct pathogen neutralization, cytokine production, and t-cell activation  <cit> . activated dcs express major histocompatibility complex  i and mhc ii molecules and t-cell costimulatory molecules, which possess the unique ability to activate naive t cells  <cit> . immature dcs  reside in the peripheral epithelial tissues, where they serve as sentinels against invading microorganisms  <cit> . contact with a pathogen typically elicits stimulation of idcs via pattern-recognition receptors, such as the toll-like receptor , and subsequent conversion of idcs to mature dcs   <cit> . mdcs exhibit a reduction in phagocytic ability and an increase in surface expression of mhc ii and costimulatory molecules, and they switch in chemokine receptor expression, which results in mdc migration to the local lymph nodes to induce adaptive immunity  <cit> .

coxiella burnetii is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium, which survives inside large replication vacuoles that display phagolysosomal characteristics  <cit> . c. burnetii is the etiologic agent of q fever, a disease with a worldwide distribution  <cit> . acute q fever is usually self-limited in immunocompetent hosts, whereas the chronic form of the disease develops in individuals defective in cell-mediated immunity  <cit> . owing to its very low infectious dose, known environment stability, and aerosol transmission route, c. burnetii is recognized as a potential biological weapon agent, and it has been classified as a category b bioterrorism agent  <cit> . an inactivated c. burnetii vaccine against acute q fever is effective, but the vaccination remains problematic owing to its significant side effects in individuals who have already had q fever  <cit> . second-generation q fever vaccine, offering significant relief from adverse reactions, has been developed by means of chloroform-methanol extraction of phase i organisms by williams and colleagues  <cit> ; however, the complex procedure and biosecurity requirements in dealing with the propagation and purification of c. burnetii organisms are a hindrance to large-scale production.

a safe, effective subunit vaccine against q fever would clearly be desirable, and a number of potential protective antigens have been identified toward developing such a vaccine  <cit> . among them, coxiella outer-membrane protein  <dig>  and heat-shock protein b  were strongly recognized by sera from q fever patients or c. burnetii-infected animals  <cit> . hspb is a member of the hsp <dig> family, and hsp <dig> in legionella pneumophila  is located in the periplasm and outer membrane, and the surface-associated hsp <dig> is involved in bacterial virulence  <cit> . both com <dig> and hspb of c. burnetii are viewed as major immunodominant antigens and important surface-associated molecules that can interact with surface molecules of innate/adaptive immune cells  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether com <dig> and hspb possess the ability to mount immune responses against c. burnetii infection.

in the present study, the recombinant proteins com <dig> and hspb were used to pulse human monocyte-derived dcs  in vitro, and the maturation and activation status of the pulsed hmdcs were measured by flow cytometry. since the protective response to intracellular bacteria is mainly dependent on a cell-mediated immune reaction, the pulsed hmdcs were used to stimulate isogenic t cells in vitro; the maturation and activation status of cd4+ and cd8+ cells in the t-cell population were analyzed after interaction of the hmdcs with the t cells. we found that com <dig> induced efficient maturation and activation of hmdcs and that com1-pulsed cells were able to initiate the adaptive t-cell response by skewing cd4+ and cd8+ cells toward, respectively, the th <dig> and tc <dig> pathway. in contrast, hspb elicited incomplete maturation of hmdcs, and hspb-pulsed cells were unable to induce efficient t-cell proliferation and activation.

RESULTS
immunoblot analysis of com <dig> and hspb
the purified recombinant proteins com <dig> and hspb were analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and incubated with sera from mice experimentally infected with c. burnetii . the recombinant com <dig> and hspb were strongly recognized by infected mouse sera obtained at  <dig> and  <dig> days postinfection.

maturation and activation of hmdcs induced by com <dig> and hspb
to determine the capability of com <dig> and hspb to induce maturation and activation of hmdcs, immature hmdcs  were treated with com <dig>  hspb, or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide  for  <dig> h. the resulting populations of hmdcs were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine their expression of surface molecules. as shown in figure  <dig>  com1-treated hmdcs exhibited substantially increased expression of surface molecules, and the expression levels of surface molecules  were equal to or higher than those of lps-treated hmdcs. however, with hspb-treated hmdcs, cd <dig> expression remained at baseline levels, while expression of the other surface molecules was much lower than with com1-pulsed hmdcs .

cytokine expression of hmdc elicited by com <dig> and hspb
antigen-activated dcs play an important role in controlling differentiation orientation of naive t cells by differential expression of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  to investigate the possible effector function of com1- or hspb-pulsed hmdcs on t cells, the production of intracellular il-12p <dig> and il- <dig> was determined in the antigen-treated hmdcs. as seen in figure  <dig>  the percentages of il- <dig> p70-positive cells in the com1-pulsed hmdcs were approximately 23-, 30-, and 35-fold higher, respectively, than in the mock-pulsed hmdcs, lps-pulsed hmdcs, and hspb-pulsed hmdcs. the percentage of il-12p70-positive cells in the hspb-pulsed hmdcs was 36-fold lower than in the com1-pulsed hmdcs, whereas the percentage of il-10-positive cells in the hspb-pulsed hmdcs was threefold higher than in the com1-pulsed hmdcs .

early t-cell activation induced by antigen-pulsed hmdcs
to evaluate the direct effect of the antigen-pulsed hmdcs on t-cell activation, cd <dig> expression in both cd4+ and cd8+ cells was determined by flow cytometry after  <dig> h of interaction of t cells with antigen-pulsed hmdcs . as a result, the percentages of cd4-cd <dig> and cd8-cd <dig> double-positive cells among t cells cocultured with com1-pulsed hmdcs were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured with mock-pulsed hmdcs; the percentages of cd4-cd <dig> and cd8-cd <dig> double-positive cells among t cells cocultured with hspb-pulsed hmdcs were only  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured with mock-pulsed hmdcs . the percentages of cd4-cd <dig> and cd8-cd <dig> double-positive cells among t-cells cocultured with com1-pulsed hmdcs were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured with hspb-pulsed hmdcs .

cytokine production of t cells elicited by antigen-pulsed hmdcs
to determine the differentiation orientation of t cells after their interaction with antigen-pulsed hmdcs, the production of cytokines  was determined in cd4+ and cd8+ cells. the percentages of cd4-ifn-γ and cd8-ifn-γ double-positive cells among t-cells cocultured with com1-pulsed hmdcs were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured with hspb-pulsed hmdcs . meanwhile, the percentages of cd4-tnf-α and cd8-tnf-α double-positive cells among t cells cocultured with com1-pulsed hmdcs were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured with hspb-pulsed hmdcs . additionally, il- <dig> expression of cd4+ and cd8+ cells among t cells treated with com1-pulsed hmdcs or hspb-pulsed hmdcs remained at baseline levels .

t-cell proliferation induced by antigen-pulsed hmdcs
t-cell proliferation induced by com1- or hspb-pulsed hmdcs was evaluated by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester -based proliferation assay after  <dig> h of interaction of t cells with antigen-pulsed hmdcs. the proliferation rates of cd4+ and cd8+ cells among t-cells cocultured with com1-pulsed hmdcs were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher, respectively, than those cocultured with hspb-pulsed hmdcs .

immune protective analysis of com1- and hspb-pulsed bmdcs
compared with mice receiving mock-pulsed bmdcs , animals receiving com1-pulsed bmdcs exhibited significantly lower coxiella burden; mice receiving hspb-pulsed bmdcs displayed similar high levels of coxiella burden after challenge with c. burnetii . coxiella burden in mice receiving hspb-pulsed bmdcs was significantly higher than in those receiving com1-pulsed bmdcs; coxiella burden in animals receiving i ag-pulsed bmdcs was much lower than in mice receiving com1-pulsed bmdcs .

discussion
com <dig> was first recognized as an immunoreactive protein associated with the outer membrane of c. burnetii by hendrix and colleagues  <cit> , and it was identified as a major immunodominant antigen of c. burnetii in other studies  <cit> . hspb was similarly recognized as a major immunodominant antigen of c. burnetii  <cit>  and was suggested as being a surface-associated protein  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether com <dig> and hspb are able to mount specific immune responses, particularly a cell-mediated immune response against c. burnetii in humans.

in the present study, com <dig> and hspb were applied to stimulate hmdcs, and the antigen-pulsed hmdcs were arranged to stimulate isogenic t cells. to explore a possible mechanism of the immune response induced by com <dig> or hspb, the immune effector functions  were measured by flow cytometry.

dcs are present in most tissues in an immature status, and they undergo maturation upon antigen capture, whereupon they migrate to the lymph nodes to elicit adaptive immune responses  <cit> . in the present study, the com1-pulsed hmdcs exhibited increased expression of surface molecules, including the dc-maturation marker , costimulatory molecules , and adhesion molecules . in addition, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> are dc-maturation markers, and thus their increased expression in com1-pulsed hmdcs suggests that com <dig> has the ability to induce efficient maturation of hmdcs.

these surface molecules expressed on mature hmdcs may efficiently initiate the primary adaptive immune response. during this response, naive t cells polarize toward the antigen-presenting dcs, and a specific large-scale molecular complex is built at the dc-t-cell interface  <cit> . t-cell activation is regulated primarily by signalling events that derive from the interaction between the t-cell receptor  and the presented antigens on dcs and the interaction between t-cell surface molecules  and costimulatory  or adhesion molecules  on dcs  <cit> . the cd80/cd86-cd <dig> interaction provides important signals for t-cell activation and survival, and the cd40-cd <dig> interaction is crucial for the development of cd4+ t-cell-dependent effector functions; the interactions of both cd54-cd11a and cd58-cd <dig> act as a central part in the clustering of dcs and cd4+ t cells  <cit> . therefore, the increased expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules on com1-activated hmdcs strongly indicates that com1-activated hmdcs possess the ability to induce efficient proliferation and activation of naive t cells.

t-cell proliferation induced by antigen-treated hmdcs was measured by flow cytometry of cfse dye dilution. our results showed that the proliferation levels of cd4+ and cd8+ cells in t cells cocultured with com1-activated hmdcs were significantly higher than those cocultured with mock-pulsed hmdcs. this suggests that com1-activated hmdcs efficiently stimulated naive t cells to expand the populations of both cd4+ and cd8+ subsets before acquiring t-cell effector function.

it is well established that antigen-activated dcs can regulate the balance of th <dig> and th <dig> by differential expression between il- <dig> and il- <dig>  if il- <dig> is much higher than il- <dig>  the naive t cells will be skewed toward the th <dig> phenotype; conversely, if il- <dig> is much higher than il- <dig>  the naive t cells will differentiate toward the th <dig> phenotype. in the present study, high il-12p <dig> and low il- <dig> expression were found in com1-pulsed hmdcs, which suggests that com1-activated hmdcs possess the ability to drive t cells toward th <dig> differentiation through the th1-specific cytokine il- <dig> 

to demonstrate the capability of com1-pulsed hmdcs to activate t cells, the t-cell activation marker cd <dig> on cd4+ and cd8+ cells was determined after t-cell interaction with com1-pulsed hmdcs. our results showed that the percentages of cd4-cd <dig> and cd8-cd <dig> double-positive cells among t cells that interacted with com1-pulsed hmdcs were much greater than those that interacted with mock-pulsed hmdcs. this firmly suggests that both cd4+ and cd8+ cells are efficiently activated through strong accessory signals derived from the surface-molecule interactions between com1-activated hmdcs and t cells.

laboratory studies have demonstrated that protection against c. burnetii infection is conferred by a th1-oriented immune response, which depends on the th1-specific cytokine ifn-γ and inflammatory cytokine tnf-α since both cytokines have the ability to upregulate the bactericidal activity of macrophages  <cit> . in the present study, th1-specific cytokine ifn-γ and th2-specific cytokine il- <dig> as well as inflammatory cytokine tnf-α were determined in t cells after exposure to com1-activated hmdcs. our results showed that the expression of ifn-γ and tnf-α in cd4+ and cd8+ cells was dramatically increased after t-cell interaction with com1-pulsed hmdcs. however, the il- <dig> expression in cd4+ and cd8+ cells in this t-cell population remained at baseline levels. these results strongly imply that com1-pulsed hmdcs have the ability to drive differentiation of naive cd4+ and cd8+ cells toward, respectively, cd4+ th <dig> and cd8+ tcl cells and that hmdc-activated cd4+ and cd8+ cells may produce ifn-γ and tnf-α to enhance the intracellular bactericidal activity of the host cells .

to demonstrate the immunoprotective ability of com <dig>  com1-pulsed bmdcs were adaptively transferred to naive mice. our results showed that mice receiving com1-pulsed bmdcs exhibited significantly lower coxiella burden than control animals after challenge with virulent c. burnetii. however, the coxiella burden in mice receiving hspb-pulsed bmdcs was significantly higher than in those receiving com1-pulsed bmdcs. this suggests that hspb is not a protective antigen.

we found that hspb was unable to induce efficient maturation and activation of hmdcs. the expressions of maturation marker , costimulatory , and adhesion molecules  of hspb-pulsed hmdcs were much lower than those of com1-pulsed hmdcs. moreover, hspb-pulsed hmdcs produced much lower levels of il- <dig>  but much higher levels of il- <dig>  than com1-pulsed hmdcs. the increased expression of il- <dig> in dcs may inhibit t-cell proliferation  <cit> . similarly, motta et al.  <cit>  showed that mycobacterium tuberculosis hsp <dig> inhibited t-cell proliferation in vitro, since it impaired dc maturation and induced high production of il- <dig> in dcs; this suggests that hsp <dig> does not have inflammatory potential but rather immunosuppressive properties.

in this study, the percentages of cd8-cd <dig> and cd4-cd <dig> double-positive cells among t cells cocultured with hspb-pulsed hmdcs were much lower than those cocultured with com1-pulsed hmdcs. hspb-pulsed hmdcs caused a negligible proliferation of cd8+ and cd4+ cells, which suggests that the low-level expression of costimulatory molecules and adherence molecules of hspb-pulsed hmdcs was unable to activate the t cells.

generally, the interaction between the innate/adaptive immune system and invading c. burnetii is sufficient to eradicate the organisms, which elicit asymptomatic or mild, self-limiting, flu-like symptoms in most human c. burnetii infections. the bactericidal immune response is mainly based on inflammatory cytokines ifn-γ and tnf-α  <cit> . however, a variety of pathogens can take advantage of the anti-inflammatory properties of il- <dig>  as a mean of avoiding sterilizing immunity and establishing a persistent infection  <cit> . in c. burnetii infections, il- <dig> is believed to have the ability to disarm bactericidal responses and contribute to chronic development of c. burnetii infection. previous studies  <cit>  showed that il- <dig> promoted replication of c. burnetii in human monocytes and c. burnetii established a more robust infection in il-10-overexpressing transgenic mice owing to the macrophages failing to kill the bacteria. another study revealed that il- <dig> overproduction was involved in establishing persistent c. burnetii infections and was related to q fever endocarditis development  <cit> . clearly, il- <dig> plays an important role in persistent c. burnetii infection. therefore, the high level of anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> generated in hspb-pulsed hmdcs may be an important factor in inhibiting proliferation and activation of t cells.

in our recent study, adaptive transfer of mouse bmdcs stimulated with coxiella antigens into babl/c mice showed that the coxiella burden in animals receiving com1-pulsed bmdcs was significantly lower than in mice receiving enha-pulsed bmdcs  <cit> . although both com <dig> and enha had the ability to activate bmdcs to express mhc-ii and costimulatory molecules, cd4+ t cells from mice receiving com1-pulsed bmdcs exhibited significantly higher cd <dig> expression than animals receiving enha-pulsed bmdcs after coculture with homologous antigen-pulsed bmdcs. in addition, the percentages of cd4+ and ifn-γ double-positive cells in mice receiving com1-pulsed bmdcs were significantly higher than in animals receiving enha-pulsed bmdcs; the percentages of cd4+ and il- <dig> double-positive cells in mice receiving com1-bmdcs were significantly higher than in mice receiving enha-pulsed bmdcs  <cit> . however, the percentages of regulatory t lymphocytes in mice receiving com1-pulsed bmdcs were substantially lower than in animals receiving enha-pulsed bmdcs  <cit> . our results suggest that the protection offered by com1-pulsed bmdcs is correlated with the increased proliferation of th <dig> cd4+ t cells, preferential development of th <dig> cells, and impaired expansion of regulatory t lymphocytes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that com <dig> is able to induce complete maturation and activation of hmdcs that drive t cells toward th <dig> and tc <dig> polarization; however, hspb-induced incompletely mature hmdcs are unable to induce efficient t-cell proliferation and activation. unlike hspb, com <dig> is a potent protective antigen of c. burnetii, which has been demonstrated by adoptive transfers of com1-pulsed and hspb-pulsed bmdcs into naive balb/c mice.
