BACKGROUND
microbes are the most abundant and diverse organisms on earth and their interactions are crucial in understanding both the ecology and the evolution of microorganisms. microbial interactions, including mutualism, competition, parasitism and commensalism, are difficult to quantify as the underlying processes usually cannot be observed directly and are often too complex for laboratory experiments  <cit> . however, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have made large scale surveys of microbial communities feasible. metagenomic studies and network-based approaches have yield detailed information on the composition of microbial communities, which in turn pave the way to study the structure of microbial ecosystems and their dynamics .

elucidating competitive and cooperative relationship is a challenge in generating a microbial interaction network because of the direction of such interactions  <cit> . competition and cooperation are the two most studied microbial interactions in the recent times with the former dominating the latter in various microbial communities . recent studies have also shown that competitive interactions can drive the evolution of cooperation in microbial ecosystems  <cit> . therefore, identifying competitive and cooperative relationships between microbes is profound importance; however, the directional nature of such interactions also poses as a difficult challenge in network construction.

there are several approaches in constructing a microbial network. one commonly used method is the similarity-based network construction where the co-occurrences of two species over multiple time-series samples are measured to infer their interaction . in such networks, nodes correspond to organisms and an edge between two nodes represents the significant relationship of two taxa across a set of time series samples. although other derived approaches  can identify the pairwise relationships between microbes by using correlation estimation, they do not identify the nature and the strength of these relationships  <cit> . in general, these methods cannot capture the complexity of microbial interactions and cannot elucidate how microbes regulate each other.

to model complex relationships , methods employing mathematical and statistical models have been developed recently. for example, the generalized lotka–volterra framework was used to model the dynamics of microbial populations in order to estimate parameters governing species-species interactions . moreover, other studies have used nonparametric regression models to infer the dynamic relationships between three microbial populations  <cit> . these regression models use smooth functions to describe microbial relationships and estimate their relative effects. because these regression analyses do not use a priori knowledge to build dynamic microbial interactions, the prediction from those models often lack biological explanations, especially when the microbial community under examination is a complex one  <cit> . therefore, how to construct a meaningful microbial interaction network remains a challenge in microbial ecology.

due to the importance of competitive and cooperative relationships between microbes in complex ecological communities  <cit> , an inference model for constructing microbial regulatory network should consider these interactions simultaneously. however, all of the studies mentioned above do not incorporate these features into their construction of regulatory networks. association rule mining can be a promising way to infer complex relationships. a rule-based method, named smooth response surface  algorithm, was developed to construct complex regulatory networks  <cit> . basing on a piecewise linear-quadratic polynomial, the srs algorithm uses a three-dimensional model surface  to successfully infer the relationships between the target, activator, and repressor nodes.

in this paper, we adopt a similar rationale as the srs algorithm to detect the cooperative and competitive relationships between microbes for constructing microbial regulatory networks. our new methodology, named the rule-based microbial network  algorithm, is an advanced version of the rule-based approach. we used tanh functions for modeling nonlinear responses as regulatory effects of microbes. to our understanding, tanh functions have been used to model nonlinear responses in some microbial studies, such as dose influences of pathogens  <cit> , regulatory effects of microbes  <cit> , influences of microbial compositions   <cit> . the rmn algorithm uses a nonlinear regulatory otu-triplet  model to capture cooperative and competitive relationships and consequently infers the directional interaction between microbes. we applied our new approach to simulated data and showed that the rmn algorithm was capable to reconstruct microbial regulatory networks. furthermore, we used koenig’ data  to construct the interaction network for the microbial community in infant gut  <cit> ; and our results suggest that bifidobacterium, streptococcus, clostridium xi, and bacteroides play essential roles in regulating the abundance of veillonella in an infant gut microbiome.

methods
sample collection
to construct microbial regulatory networks in infant intestinal tracts, we used the pyrosequencing reads of 16s rrna genes from  <dig> infant gut samples, which were treated with four diet states at four time periods  <cit> . these infant gut samples were collected over  <dig> time points. the average length of 16s rrna gene sequences were 237 bps  <cit> , we used only 16s rrna gene sequences with length longer than 200 bps in this study.

taxonomic classification and otu assignment
the ribosomal database project  classifier  <cit>  was used to classify 16s rrna pyrosequencing reads and to perform an operational taxonomic unit  assignment. after accomplishing the otu assignment with a threshold of 80 % confidence, we carried out a further filtering step by removing operational taxonomic units  that appeared in fewer than half of the total time points.

relative abundance analysis
to estimate the relative difference between individual otus at each time point, we calculated the relative abundance of individual otus. first, we defined the pyrosequencing read number of the ith otu at jth time point as yij. second, we defined the sum of the pyrosequencing read numbers at jth time point as yj. finally, we divided yij by yj to obtain the relative proportion xij of the ith otu at jth time point. after all pyrosequencing read numbers were transformed into relative proportions, we removed the lth otu if both the maximum relative proportion of all xlj was less than  <dig>  and the coefficient of variation of all xlj was larger than  <dig> . in addition, we filtered out the data at the kth time point if both the maximum of all xik was less than  <dig>  and the total number of otus was less than 60 % at the kth time point. finally, the missing values were filled through the bayesian principal component analysis  with k =  <dig>  <cit> .

data standardization
the relative proportion of each otu at each time point was standardized in order to estimate the difference between otus at each time point. the relative proportion xij of the ith otu at the jth time point was transformed such that it fell within the interval  <cit> . we defined pij as  /, where pij is the standardized relative proportion  of the ith otu at the jth time point, while xmin and xmax are the minimum and maximum relative proportions respectively.

network construction
we developed a rule-based microbial network  algorithm to construct microbial regulatory networks. the rmn algorithm is based on a nonlinear regulatory otu-triplet model, named the nro model for short. figure  <dig> shows the flowchart of the rmn algorithm, and the details are as follows:fig.  <dig> the flowchart of the rmn algorithm. first, the standardized relative proportions  of otus were analyzed and found out possible otu-triplets. then, suitable otu-triplets were selected by nonlinear regulatory otu-triplet  model. finally, the microbial network was reconstructed



 to investigate how each otu was involved in microbial regulatory network, we constructed a nonlinear regulatory otu-triplet model by using triplets of otus across all time points . the nonlinear regulatory otu-triplet model has three assumptions: first, a cooperation–competition system is assumed to exist in the microbial regulatory network. an otu-triplet is defined as {om, oc, ot}, where om, oc, and ot represent the mth , cth and tth otus respectively. here, om and oc are assumed to be the cooperator and the competitor of ot respectively. in other words, the relationship between the mth and the tth otus is assumed to be cooperative, while that between the cth and the tth otus is assumed to be competitive. note that om, oc and ot represent different microbes in genus level. second, it is assumed that the standardized relative proportion  of ot is high when the srp of om is high and the srp of oc is low. conversely, the srp of ot is assumed to be low when the srp of the om is low and the srp of the oc is high. third, the relationship between om, oc and ot can be modeled by using a three-dimensional model surface   which is based on a piecewise nonlinear-quadratic polynomial:fig.  <dig> the 3d image of a three-dimensional model surface . p is the inferred the standardized relative proportion  of o
t, where p
m and p
c are the srps of o

in , pm and pc are the standardized relative proportions  of om and oc respectively while p is the inferred srp of ot.

 to find suitable otu-triplets close to the 3d-ms for the otu-triplet regulatory model, we used a lack-of-fit function to analyze all possible otu-triplets. the lack-of-fit function is defined as:  <dig> lomocot=∑n=1k2∑n=1k <dig> 

where p^tn is the inferred srp of ot at the nth time point  at the nth time point ); ptn is the observed srp of ot at the nth time point; and p−tn represents the average of ptn across all k time points. a small l value indicates a good fit between an otu-triplet {om, oc, ot} and the 3d-ms. in other words, a smaller l value reveals a stronger relationship among om, oc, and ot. similar rationale has been successfully applied for constructing gene regulatory networks  <cit> .

 to check the reliability of otu-triplets, we used an adjustment function to fix imperfect measurements at one or more time points . the adjustment function is defined as:  <dig> domocot=∑n=1klnomocotlomocotlog10lnomocotlomocot 

where l is the value of lack-of-fit function when the information from the nth time point is removed. a smaller d value indicates the information of the otu-triplet relationship is reliable. finally, an integrated function, i is defined as the value of l multiplied by the value of ). a smaller i value indicates a stronger otu-triplet relationship among om, oc, and ot.

 finally, we defined two criteria, ld = l/) and d, to filter out unreliable otu-triplets, when  <dig> ≦ ld ≦ l and d < d. note the l and d are constants. we then ranked reliable otu-triplets basing on the sorted i values in the ascending order, and selected otu-triplets with lower i values as candidates for network construction.

performance analysis
to evaluate the performance of the rmn algorithm, we simulated a microbial regulatory network consisting of ten gut bacteria, three latent factors, and ten noise factors as follows:  <dig> o1s= <dig> tanh− <dig> f2s+ <dig> +n1so2s= <dig> tanh <dig> f2s+ <dig> +n2so3s=tanh− <dig> o1s+ <dig> f1s+ <dig> +n3so4s=tanh <dig> o1s− <dig> o2s− <dig> o3s+ <dig> +n4so5s=tanh <dig> o2s− <dig> o3s− <dig> f1s+ <dig> +n5so6s= <dig> tanh <dig> o5s− <dig> o3s+ <dig> +n6so7s= <dig> tanh− <dig> o5s+ <dig> +n7so8s=tanh− <dig> f3s+ <dig> +n8so9s=tanh− <dig> o6s+ <dig> o7s+ <dig> o8s+ <dig> +n9so10s=tanh− <dig> o7s+ <dig> o8s+ <dig> f3s+ <dig> +n10s 

we used tanh functions to create simulated a microbial regulatory network because tanh functions have been used to model regulatory responses of pathogens and microbes . in addition, the similar idea has been used to create simulated gene networks for evaluating the performance of gasa method  <cit> . in detail, we defined this synthetic regulatory model in fig.  <dig>  where oi is the abundance proportion of the ith otu with i = <dig> ,…,10; fj is the abundance proportion of jth latent factor with j =  <dig>   <dig>  3; and nk is the abundance proportion of the kth noise factor with k =  <dig> ,…, <dig>  note the value of oi is between  <dig> and  <dig>  while fj is a random variable between  <dig> and  <dig>  nk is a random variable representing the noise level in the simulated data  =  <dig>  no noise exists in the simulated data). three noise levels are assumed in the simulated data: low noise if the value of nk is equal to the variance of oi divided by rk; medium noise if nk is equal to five times the low noise level; and high noise if nk is equal to ten times the low noise level. here, rk represents the signal-noise ratio and its range was between  <dig> and  <dig>  note that rk is an integral and is generated by using time-series data of gut bacteria  <cit> . in detail, rk is the average proportion of gut bacteria divided by its standard deviation.fig.  <dig> simulation of microbial regulatory network. for example, o
 <dig> is defined to interact competitively with o
 <dig> but interact cooperatively with o

we evaluated the performance of the rmn algorithm by calculating the following measures: true positive rate , true negative rate , f-measure, and accuracy. tpr is defined as tp/, where tp and fn are the numbers of true positive interactions  and false negative interactions  respectively. tnr is defined as tn/, where tn and fp are the numbers of true negative interactions  and false positive interactions  respectively. we define f-measure as 2*tpr*tnr/ , and accuracy as /.

RESULTS
performance of rmn algorithm using simulation data
we generated simulated data under different levels of noise and evaluated the performance of our rmn algorithm by using the above mentioned four evaluation measures. then, we analyzed the occurrence rate  of  <dig> simulated microbial regulatory networks when any three of four evaluation measures showed the efficiency superior or equal to the defined value. . all four evaluation measures suggest high performance from our rmn algorithm. comparing different noise levels, rmn algorithm has shown the best efficiency when there is no noise in the simulated data. even at medium noise level, over 82 % of the results show efficiency values higher than  <dig> . in addition, the assessment from those four evaluation measures shows  <dig>  efficiency value on more than 74 % simulated data. there are no significant differences between the performance results when the noise is varied from zero to medium level ). although the performance of our rmn algorithm at the high noise level is worse than those from lower noise levels, its efficiency value is still over  <dig> . more interestingly, according to tnr, there were fewer false positive interactions  when inferred from the high noise data than that from lower noise data ). in addition, best efficiency under different noise interferences exceeds  <dig>  ). during developing rmn algorithm, we used two conditions, ld and d, to filter out unreliable otu-triplets, and we tried to select the suitable thresholds for ld and d by analyzing the simulation data . the best efficiency for all evaluations reached over  <dig>  when the threshold at ld and d were used . moreover, the efficiency for all evaluations reached over  <dig>  when the threshold at ld and d. all in all, our efficiency evaluations demonstrate that the performance of our rmn algorithm is robust under three latent factors and different noise levels.fig.  <dig> efficiency analysis of rmn algorithm for simulated data under different level of noise interference. the threshold was set at 0≦l

inferring the regulatory relationship of microbial pairs with low correlation coefficient
recent study shows that correlations between the abundances of microbes do not imply microbial interactions  <cit> . in order to investigate whether otu-triplets obtained by rmn algorithm are significantly correlated based on their correlation coefficient and whether rmn algorithm can find the regulator relationship behind standard correlation-based approaches, we analyzed the optimal resulting triplets with true positive links . here we used spearman's rank correlation coefficient for the estimation of nonlinear correlation coefficient. the pr value represents a probability of rmn algorithm prediction for otu pairs whose nonlinear correlation coefficient is less than  <dig> . in detail, pr value  was defined as  *100 %/total_count, where omot_count is the number of resulting triplets with a true positive link between cooperator otu and target otu pair whose nonlinear correlation coefficient is less than  <dig> ; ocot _count is the number of resulting triplets with a true positive link between competitor otu and target otu pair whose nonlinear correlation coefficient is greater than − <dig> ; total count is the number of resulting triplets with a true positive link. as table  <dig> shown, under different levels of noise inference, pr values for most analyzed results were more than 15 %. that may imply the resulting triplets contain otu pairs with low nonlinear correlation coefficient. for example, more than 15 % otu pairs with low nonlinear correlation coefficient  could be found when the threshold was set at 0≦ld ≦ <dig>  and d <  <dig> . based on the threshold, the performances of rmn algorithm were more than  <dig>  . in addition, more than 20 % otu pairs with low nonlinear correlation coefficient  could be found when the threshold was set at 0≦ld ≦ <dig>  and d <  <dig> . based on the threshold, the performances of rmn algorithm were more than  <dig>  . in other words, the rmn algorithm may characterize the regulatory relationship composed of otu pairs with low correlation coefficient, and has a choice to find the regulator relationship behind standard correlation-based approaches.table  <dig> the nonlinear correlation coefficient of otu pairs, predicted by rmn algorithm as co-regulated triplets, under different level of noise interference. a triplet predicted by rmn algorithm is composed of cooperator, competitor and target. here l <dig>  represents for 0≦ l

the construction of microbial regulatory network from infant gut data
to further demonstrate the capability of our rmn algorithm, we constructed microbial interaction networks from a set of real microbial community time series data. the data used consist of  <dig> infant gut samples treated with four diet states at four time periods  <cit> .

after performing taxonomic classification and otu assignment,  <dig> otus were obtained . however, after the filtering process removing otus that appeared in less than half of the total time points, only  <dig> otus met the requirement . in addition, after performing relative abundance analysis and filling missing values,  <dig> otus with  <dig> time points were obtained. finally, according to fig. 3c from koenig, et al.  <cit> , only  <dig> otus with  <dig> time points between four steps were selected for analyzing using our rmn algorithm . consistently, among  <dig> otus,  <dig> otus  were found to be involved in competitive and cooperative interactions in freilich’s study  <cit> . since microbiome data are usually enormous and inherently noisy, the threshold was set at 0≦ld ≦ <dig>  and d <  <dig>  for better prediction sensitivity . before filtering by this threshold, top  <dig> possible otu-triplets from  <dig> otus analysis were listed in additional file  <dig>  after filtering by this threshold, only  <dig> reliable otu-triplets from  <dig> otus  were used to construct microbial regulatory network. the resulting microbial interaction network among five otus is displayed in fig.  <dig>  gram-negative anaerobic cocci, veillonella , is found to interact cooperatively with three otus, namely clostridium xi , bifidobacterium  and streptococcus , but competitively with bacteroides . among them, bifidobacterium, streptococcus, and bacteroides have been identified in competitive and cooperative metabolic interactions  <cit> . in particular, we observed a positive correlation between veillonella and bifidobacterium , both residing in human intestines and oral mucosa as anaerobic commensal organisms  <cit> . this directional interaction also suggests the commensal relationship between veillonella and bifidobacterium. in addition, veillonella was also observed to have a positive correlation with streptococcus. they have been found to interact cooperatively during the production and degradation of lactic acid . recently, positive correlations were also found between the abundances of veillonella and streptococcus  <cit> . in addition, the constructed network also suggests that competitive relationship may exist between veillonella and bacteroides. veillonella and bacteroides are gut-associated obligate anaerobic genera found in maternal faeces, breast milk and neonatal faeces  <cit> ; and the difference in their efficiency on oligosaccharide consumptions may suggest they occupy different metabolic niches  <cit> . in addition, our network suggests there might be a cooperative relationship between veillonella and clostridium xi clostridium glycolicum; and this cooperative relationship might suggest their simultaneous involvement in the ear infections in infants. in fact, those two gut bacteria have been found to be associated with bacterial infections, such as bacteremia  <cit> . finally, microbial interaction network from fig.  <dig> were analyzed to check if the rmn algorithm can predict microbial interactions from low correlation data. as shown, it confirmed that otu pairs with low correlations can be predicted by rmn algorithm . in general, our constructed network can extrapolate cooperative and competitive relationships between microbes in infant guts.table  <dig> the efficiency analysis under different level of noise interference by using the simulated data who’s best performance showed at a threshold on 0≦ l

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we presented rmn algorithm, a rule-based algorithm using the otu-triplet model with parametric weighting function, to construct microbial regulatory networks. rmn algorithm can theoretically extract directional interactions to delineate the cooperative and competitive relationships between microbes from high-throughput sequencing time series data. the efficiency estimation shows the high performance of rmn algorithm on simulated data with three latent factors and different noise levels. we also applied our framework to identify new relationships in infant gut samples. rmn algorithm is both computationally feasible and capable of detecting biologically significant progresses embedded in a microbial community.

although simple pairwise relationship has been used to describe complex forms of microbial interactions, advanced techniques are still required to infer complex microbial networks. recent studies show that the cooperative and competitive relationships between microbes coexist in complicated ecological communities  <cit> . in addition, triplet relation, like activator-repressor-target pattern, has been adopted to construct gene regulatory network form time course gene expression data  <cit> . basing on such a rationale, we developed rmn algorithm to describe the relationship among every triplet of microbe as the cooperator-competitor-target. rmn algorithm is used to search for triplet relations of otus where the abundances of the target should be high while that for the cooperator is high and that for the competitor is low . our evaluation results suggest rmn algorithm has high performance when subjected to simulated data with different levels of noise . as presented in the results, our algorithm has characterized well-known and possible microbial interactions from time series microbiome data of infant gut samples .

in summary, networks reconstructed by using simple similarity-based method often fail to capture the complex topology of a real system, and such networks may be full of false positive links. furthermore, biologically significant relationships are often difficult to be identified from such networks. our rmn algorithm can produce low false positive links even for highly noisy data ). moreover, rmn algorithm is designed to explore complex networks consisted of non-linear, decentralized and directed interactions among microbes. however, having said all these, the drawback of rmn algorithm is that it may not be able to detect simple linear correlation between two otus. another potential concern is that we tested our method using a simulated data with the tanh functions, the circularity in the model construction and validation can cause bias on our results. overall, rmn algorithm can theoretically predict microbial interactions from low correlation data . our method should be a promising starting step to identify novel microbial interactions that normally cannot be found by using similarity-based methods. therefore, by integrating similarity-based methods and our rmn algorithm, one can potentially gain a more accurate picture of microbial interactions towards a better understanding of microbial dynamics.
