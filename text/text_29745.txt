BACKGROUND
preeclampsia, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria developing after midgestation, is a severe complication of human pregnancy with a worldwide incidence of 2-10%. it is one of the leading causes of maternal, as well as perinatal morbidity and mortality, even in developed countries. despite intensive research efforts, the etiology and pathogenesis of preeclampsia are not completely understood. increasing evidence suggests that an excessive maternal systemic inflammatory response to pregnancy with activation of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease  <cit> . the development of preeclampsia is influenced by both genetic and environmental risk factors, suggesting its multifactorial inheritance  <cit> .

an important feature of systemic inflammation in preeclampsia is the absence of th <dig> skewness characteristic for healthy pregnancy, and thus the predominance of th1-type immunity. saito et al. reported firstly that the percentage of th <dig> cells and the ratios of th1/th <dig> were significantly higher, while the percentage of th <dig> cells was significantly lower in the peripheral blood in preeclampsia than in the third trimester of normal pregnancy  <cit> . in another study, this group observed increased production of interleukin - <dig>  interferon -γ and tumor necrosis factor -α by peripheral blood mononuclear cells  in preeclampsia and, interestingly, positive correlations between mean blood pressure and concentrations of th <dig> cytokines  <cit> . the shift to a predominant th1-type immunity in preeclampsia was reinforced by other experiments on intracellular cytokine measurements in peripheral blood t  cells and nk cells, as well as by assessment of cytokine secretion levels of pbmcs isolated from preeclamptic patients  <cit> . however, the studies on circulating levels of cytokines in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia yielded conflicting results  <cit> . the discrepancies may be due to different techniques used for cytokine detection, differences in the ethnicity of the study populations, disease severity or sample sizes.

the aim of this study was to determine circulating levels of cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules in a comprehensive manner involving a large number of healthy non-pregnant and pregnant women and preeclamptic patients. we also measured several markers of processes involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, and investigated whether serum cytokine, chemokine and adhesion molecule levels were related to the clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of the study participants, including markers of overall inflammation , endothelial activation  and endothelial injury , oxidative stress  and trophoblast debris .

methods
study patients
our study was designed using a case-controlled approach. sixty preeclamptic patients,  <dig> healthy pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies and  <dig> healthy non-pregnant women were involved in the study. the study participants were enrolled in the first department of obstetrics and gynecology and in the department of obstetrics and gynecology of kútvölgyi clinical center, at the semmelweis university, budapest, hungary. all women were caucasian and resided in the same geographic area in hungary. exclusion criteria were multifetal gestation, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, angiopathy, renal disorder, maternal or fetal infection and fetal congenital anomaly. the women were fasting, none of the pregnant women were in active labor, and none had rupture of membranes. the healthy non-pregnant women were in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle , and none of them received hormonal contraception.

preeclampsia was defined by increased blood pressure  that occurred after  <dig> weeks of gestation in a woman with previously normal blood pressure, accompanied by proteinuria . blood pressure returned to normal by  <dig> weeks postpartum in each preeclamptic study patient. preeclampsia was regarded as severe if any of the following criteria was present: blood pressure ≥ <dig> mmhg systolic or ≥ <dig> mmhg diastolic, or proteinuria ≥ <dig> g/ <dig> h . pregnant women with eclampsia or hellp syndrome  were not enrolled in this study. early onset of preeclampsia was defined as onset of the disease before  <dig> weeks of gestation . fetal growth restriction was diagnosed if the fetal birth weight was below the 10th percentile for gestational age and gender, based on hungarian birth weight percentiles  <cit> .

the study protocol was approved by the regional and institutional committee of science and research ethics of the semmelweis university, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki.

biological samples
blood samples were taken from an antecubital vein into plain, as well as edta- or sodium citrate anticoagulated tubes, and then centrifuged at room temperature with a relative centrifugal force of  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes. the aliquots of serum and plasma were stored at -80°c until the analyses.

laboratory methods
serum levels of il-1β, il- <dig> receptor antagonist , il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-12p <dig>  il-12p <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α, interferon-γ-inducible protein - <dig>  monocyte chemotactic protein - <dig>  intercellular adhesion molecule - <dig> and vascular cell adhesion molecule - <dig> were measured by multiplex suspension array  on a bio-plex  <dig> analyzer . levels of transforming growth factor -β <dig> in maternal sera were assessed by elisa . standard laboratory parameters  and c-reactive protein  levels were determined by an autoanalyzer  using the manufacturer's kits. plasma von willebrand factor antigen  levels were quantified by elisa , while plasma fibronectin concentration by nephelometry , according to the manufacturer's instructions. after extracting dna with the silica adsorption method, the amount of cell-free fetal dna in maternal plasma was determined in patients with male newborns by quantitative real-time pcr analysis of the sex-determining region y  gene, as we described previously  <cit> . plasma malondialdehyde levels were measured by the thiobarbituric acid-based colorimetric assay  <cit> .

statistical analysis
the normality of continuous variables was assessed using the shapiro-wilk's w-test. as the continuous variables were not normally distributed, nonparametric statistical methods were used. to compare continuous variables between two groups, the mann-whitney u-test was applied, whereas to compare them among multiple groups, the kruskal-wallis analysis of variance by ranks test was performed. multiple comparisons of mean ranks for all groups were carried out as post-hoc tests. the fisher exact and pearson χ <dig> tests were used to compare categorical variables between groups. the spearman rank order correlation was applied to calculate correlation coefficients.

statistical analyses were performed using the following software: statistica  and statistical package for the social sciences . for all statistical analyses, p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

in the article, data are reported as median  for continuous variables and as number  for categorical variables.

discussion
in this study, we determined circulating levels of several cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules in healthy non-pregnant and pregnant women and preeclamptic patients by high-throughput multiplex suspension array technology. except for serum il-1β and tgf-β <dig> levels, all of the measured inflammatory variables differed significantly among the three study groups. simultaneous measurement of several markers of disease processes enabled us to explore their role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

normal pregnancy is characterized by a shift towards th2-type immunity and the inhibition of cytotoxic th <dig> immune responses, which could be harmful to the fetus   <cit> . il- <dig> and il- <dig> are the key cytokines regulating th1/th <dig> balance. il- <dig> alone can induce th2-type immunity, but in the presence of il- <dig>  il- <dig> stimulates th1-mediated immune responses  <cit> . indeed, the ratios of il- <dig> to il- <dig> secreted by pbmcs have been reported to be significantly increased in normal pregnancy  <cit> . in healthy pregnant women, the relative abundance of circulating il- <dig> over il- <dig> expressed by the increased serum il-18/il-12p <dig> ratios observed in our study, as well as the relative deficiency of the bioactive il-12p <dig> in relation to il-12p <dig>  reflected by the decreased serum il-12p70/il-12p <dig> ratios, might favour th2-type immunity. in our preeclamptic patients, serum il-12p <dig> levels were significantly higher as compared to healthy pregnant women. although circulating il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> levels were also elevated yielding similar il-18/il-12p <dig> and il-12p70/il-12p <dig> ratios as in normal pregnancy, the relative abundance of circulating il- <dig> and ifn-γ over il- <dig> - as shown by the increased serum il-2/il- <dig> and ifn-γ/il- <dig> ratios - might provide a th1-biased systemic environment in preeclampsia.

in addition to changes in th1/th <dig> balance, several other soluble inflammatory variables were also altered in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia. circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and tnf-α, the chemokines il- <dig>  ip- <dig> and mcp- <dig>  as well as the adhesion molecules icam- <dig> and vcam- <dig>  were raised in preeclampsia compared with healthy pregnancy, resulting in an overall pro-inflammatory systemic environment. elevated circulating il- <dig> receptor antagonist concentrations in preeclampsia reflect increased activity of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1α and β, which have a very short half-life in the circulation, and therefore it is difficult to detect a difference in their serum levels  <cit> . the increase in levels of the immunoregulatory cytokine il- <dig> in our preeclamptic patients is in line with previous findings and might be a compensatory phenomenon  <cit> . on the other hand, the changes in circulating cytokine profile in our healthy pregnant group were - at least in part - anti-inflammatory as shown by the decreased il-1ra, tnf-α and mcp- <dig> concentrations relative to non-pregnant women. however, decreased serum il- <dig> and increased ip- <dig> levels found in our healthy pregnant women might drive pro-inflammatory responses. indeed, the third trimester of normal pregnancy seems to be a controlled state of systemic inflammation, as expressed also by the elevated serum crp levels in our study  <cit> . interestingly, a state of controlled inflammation at the feto-maternal interface in early pregnancy with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is thought to be beneficial for trophoblast invasion  <cit> . although serum concentrations of tgf-β <dig> did not differ among our study groups, elevated levels of its soluble co-receptor, endoglin, have been observed in preeclampsia previously  <cit> . soluble endoglin impairs binding of tgf-β <dig> to its receptors and downstream signalling, leading to dysregulated tgf-β signalling in the vasculature.

the maternal systemic inflammatory response characteristic of both the third trimester of normal pregnancy and - in an excessive form - preeclampsia involves an acute-phase reaction as well as systemic oxidative stress, and circulating cytokines are central to these processes  <cit> . pro-inflammatory cytokines, primarily il- <dig>  can induce an acute-phase response  <cit> . furthermore, cytokines can cause the release of oxygen free radicals, whereas reactive oxygen metabolites can up-regulate the genes that code for pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules  <cit> . indeed, serum il- <dig>  concentrations correlated with crp levels in our healthy non-pregnant and pregnant groups. the inverse correlation between tgf-β <dig> and malondialdehyde levels of our healthy pregnant women indicates that tgf-β <dig> could inhibit lipid peroxide production in normal pregnancy. interestingly, serum mcp- <dig> and icam- <dig> concentrations showed significant positive correlations with crp and malondialdehyde levels in the group of preeclamptic patients, which implies that recruitment and adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells are central features of the generalized intravascular inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress observed in preeclampsia. the correlation of mcp- <dig> and icam- <dig> concentrations with blood pressure values and liver function parameters, respectively, suggests that these cytokines and the inflammatory processes they mediate might contribute to the development of hypertension and hepatocellular injury in this pregnancy-specific disorder.

cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules could be potential mediators of endothelial dysfunction, which is a hallmark of the maternal syndrome of preeclampsia. therefore, we examined whether these inflammatory variables were related to the markers of endothelial activation  and injury . in this study, significant correlations were found between ip- <dig>  mcp- <dig> and vcam- <dig> levels and endothelial markers in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia. certain organs with fenestrated  endothelium, such as the kidney , liver  and brain  are disproportionally affected in preeclampsia. interestingly, serum ip- <dig>  mcp- <dig> and vcam- <dig> concentrations were also related to renal and liver function parameters in our study. these findings denote the central role of these inflammatory molecules in mediating endothelial damage. ip- <dig> showed the strongest association with endothelial dysfunction in our healthy pregnant women and preeclamptic patients. indeed, ip- <dig>  has pro-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties, and this chemokine has been proposed to be a potential link between inflammation and anti-angiogenesis in preeclampsia  <cit> . the inverse correlation of ip- <dig> levels with fetal birth weight of healthy pregnant women suggests its inhibitory role in placental angiogenesis. although tnf-α can also elicit endothelial cell dysfunction and injury, no significant relationship was observed between its serum concentration and endothelial markers in this study  <cit> . nevertheless, we did not measure levels of soluble tnf receptors, which have a longer half-life than tnf-α and, thus, are thought to be more reliable markers of tnf-α activity.

the placenta is supposed to be a potential source of circulating inflammatory cytokines in preeclampsia  <cit> . interestingly, syncytiotrophoblast sheds placental debris into the maternal circulation in preeclampsia with elevated amounts. the mass of this trophoblast debris can be assessed by the measurement of copies of cell-free fetal dna in the maternal plasma  <cit> . however, circulating levels of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules did not show a significant correlation with those of cell-free fetal dna in our study, indicating that trophoblast deportation process may not substantially contribute to the elevated circulating concentrations of inflammatory molecules. others have also questioned that the placenta is the major source of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the circulation of preeclamptic women  <cit> . indeed, dysfunctional maternal endothelial cells and activated circulating leukocytes could also release inflammatory molecules into the blood in this disorder. additionally, there is a strong genetic influence on cytokine production. therefore, genetic factors might also account - at least partly - for the abnormal cytokine profile observed in preeclampsia  <cit> .

in this study, the similar cytokine profile of preeclamptic patients regardless of the severity, the time of onset of the disease or the presence of fetal growth restriction might be explained by the multifactorial etiology of preeclampsia. several genetic, behavioural and environmental factors need to interact to produce the complete picture of this pregnancy-specific disorder. our research group reported various genetic and soluble factors that were associated with the severity or complications of preeclampsia, including hellp syndrome and fetal growth restriction  <cit> . nevertheless, it is also possible that the relatively small sample size of this study prevented to detect an effect in the subgroup analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
according to our findings, preeclampsia was associated with an overall pro-inflammatory systemic environment. elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules in the maternal circulation might play a central role in the excessive systemic inflammatory response, as well as in the generalized endothelial dysfunction characteristics of the maternal syndrome of preeclampsia.
