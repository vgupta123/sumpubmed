BACKGROUND
the human genome encodes a large number of rna-binding proteins   <cit>  which carry out diverse functions and a range of biological processes. some rbps are well characterized, and their molecular functions and biological activities are partially known. rbps are also involved in post-transcriptional regulation, rna splicing, rna stability and protein synthesis. this suggests that rbps must interact with specific mrna targets. each mrna comprises a coding region flanked by 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions . a number of specific rbp target sites have been identified in the 3’-utr  <cit> . interactions between rbps and rna are finely tuned and regulated, and the disruption of such interactions is therefore implicated in a number of diseases  <cit> . furthermore, the identification of rna targets is interesting from a biological perspective because they provide insight into the precise functions of rbps  <cit> . more accurate predictions of binding sites and the molecular characteristics of such interactions are therefore highly informative  <cit> .

over the last decade, several computational approaches have been developed to predict rbp-rna interactions. one such approach relies on the use of machine learning techniques to predict individual amino acid residues on the protein surface that potentially interact with ribonucleotides, e.g. neural networks  <cit> , random forest   <cit> , naïve bayes  <cit>  and support vector machines   <cit> . these methods are based on information about binding extracted from three-dimensional binding complexes and provide accurate predictions, but they do not consider the rna-binding partner and provide no information about the rna sequence that interacts with the rbp. only a few methods address this issue:  pancaldi and bähler  <cit> , by predicting rbp-rna interactions in yeast with svm and rf; features are global rbp-rna relationships such as gene ontology terms, protein localization information and mrna properties;  catrapid <cit> , by predicting interactions with long non-coding rnas on a large-scale using physico-chemical properties and predicted secondary structures;  rpiseq <cit> , by predicting whether a given rna sequence is bound by a specific rbp using pure sequence-derived features combined with the svm and rf approach; and  wang et al.  <cit> , also using sequence-based features  to predict interactions between rbps and non-coding rnas on a large-scale by applying naïve bayes and extended naïve bayes classifiers. a more detailed description of these methods can be found in a recently published review  <cit> . other computational approaches include motif-finding tools that search for binding sites on rna molecules  <cit> . these methods need experimental data to extract significant sequence motifs within the bound sequences  <cit>  or to search for relevant sequences and structural motifs by learning from data about bound and non-bound sequences  <cit> .

the interaction between rna and rbps is protein specific  <cit> , but the interaction mechanism is not always well described despite many experimental investigations  <cit> . this may be due to different binding preferences: some rbps bind specific target sequences on the rna strand  <cit> , whereas others recognize their binding site within the rna secondary structure  <cit> . the binding recognition mechanism may differ even within the same rbp family  <cit> . currently, the detection of rna targets and the identification of specific binding sites is only possible by carrying out in vitro and in vivo experiments such as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment   <cit>  and the crosslinking and immunoprecipitation  techniques  <cit> . these methods are costly, time-consuming, are based on assumptions and have limitations reflecting experimental bias  <cit> . furthermore the rbp-rna interactions identified by such techniques tend to be species-dependent or restricted to a particular cell type or set of experimental conditions, and only expressed sequences are detected, which means many non-expressed but genuine interaction partners may be overlooked. the same applies to the non-binding sequence data: the transcriptome in a particular sample does not include all the possible transcripts even in the same species, resulting in the identification of only a subset of the potential binding and non-binding sequences. computational methods can help to capture specific protein-dependent interactions. large genome-wide transcription datasets, generated by high-throughput screening, contain valuable information about validated rna-protein interactions and this information is a useful way to improve in silico predictions.

rna-protein interactions can be predicted by using motif-finding tools to detect rbp-binding sites in rna sequences, but such methods often fail to detect complex binding mechanisms  <cit> . a single rna molecule can contain binding sites for more than one protein  <cit>  and the binding of an rbp can depend on the binding of another protein. some rbps may need more than one binding site spread along the folded rna sequence  <cit> . these specific binding mechanisms cannot be predicted by motif-finding tools alone but might be caught by features describing the general sequence composition.

we have developed an in silico binding prediction tool based on the svm approach that exploits experimental human datasets. because each rbp interacts with specific target rnas  <cit> , it is reasonable to train one svm per rbp in order to model its specific binding properties. starting from experimental datasets, we represented each rna sequence initially by its tetranucleotide composition, followed by the inclusion of significant binding patterns and secondary structure information as features. the use of svms was motivated by the superior classifications achieved in previous studies  <cit> . to evaluate the methods, we carried out 10-fold cross validations and compared our results with rnacontext <cit>  and rpiseq <cit> .

our novel rbp-dependent approach involves the individual training of one model for each rbp and the exploitation of experimental datasets. the models are trained only on rna features but also include secondary structure information.

methods
approach
our approach comprises the method oli  and two extensions: olimo, which adds protein-specific binding motifs, and olimoss, which also adds secondary structure information. we applied the proposed methods to experimental human datasets downloaded from the atlas of utr regulatory activity   <cit> . the well-studied human rbp pumilio- <dig> , extracted from the gene expression omnibus   <cit> , was used to evaluate the influence of true negative rna sequences on the prediction capability of the models. additionally, a par-clip dataset for the rbp argonaute  <dig>   <cit>  was downloaded from geo so that our approaches could be tested independently.

some rbps can bind specific sub-sequences  but these patterns are not always available. tools have therefore been developed which search for significant patterns in a group of rna sequences that are known to interact with the corresponding rbp. in our approach we used meme suite  <cit>  to detect binding motifs in silico and to embed the binding site information in the form of motif scores.

other rbps do not bind sequence motifs but instead recognize secondary structures, which we also included as features. the three-dimensional structure of the protein and the accessibility of the binding site influence the rna binding  <cit> . the accessible surface area can be determined by inspecting three-dimensional structures, but there is no high-throughput approach to parse such three-dimensional information. therefore we introduced a simple accessibility feature: an rna subsequence was defined as accessible if at least four consecutive nucleotides were single stranded, i.e. not paired with other nucleotides in a stem. double stranded ribonucleotides would be less accessible to an rbp.

the entire experimental dataset  is available for pum <dig>  but this does not apply to the remaining rbps present in aura. therefore we used  <dig> human 3’-utrs, randomly downloaded from the ensembl genome browser  <cit> , as negatives. it is possible that these negatives include transcripts that were not detected in the experiment but are potentially bound by the rbp, e.g. because they were not bound under the given conditions or their expression level was low. this fact makes the choice of negative training data challenging and it can also influence the results. therefore we calculated the confidence interval of the obtained areas under the curves  by exchanging the  <dig> human 3’-utrs  <dig> times with other randomly-selected transcripts from ensembl.

the application of machine learning to biological data is often affected by unbalanced datasets, because the number of negative examples is generally much higher than the positive ones. we chose  <dig> 3’-utrs as negatives, because this is double the greatest number of sequences used in the aura_dataset, and small enough to train models in a reasonable time. several solutions have been proposed to address the issue of unbalanced datasets  <cit>  and we decided to use an oversampling algorithm called smote  <cit> , which creates new synthetic instances within the positive data and forces the classifier to become more general.

to study our methods we carried out two different evaluations. in evaluation evaluation  <dig> we assessed the prediction of oli, olimo and olimoss against  <dig> different rbps using randomly-selected 3’-utrs as negatives. in evaluation evaluation  <dig>  to assess the influence of experimentally-validated and artificial negative data, we applied our methods to a protein with available experimentally-determined non-bound sequences. the comparison of empirical negative data and randomly-selected 3’-utrs for pum <dig> allowed us to determine the value of using real negative training data.

in both evaluations we compared our approaches to rpiseq <cit>  and rnacontext <cit> . rpiseq is directly comparable to our methods because it uses protein and rna sequences as inputs and predicts binding using svm  and random forest  . similarly, rpiseq applies the normalized tetranucleotide frequency to describe the rna sequences.

rnacontext uses a different approach based on the detection of sequence motifs and structures in a pool of training sequences, and searches for them in a set of test sequences before assigning a score.

datasets
all the datasets were derived from experiments with human cells.



aura_dataset. the aura_dataset comprises rbps and related rna sequences downloaded from aura . aura is an online database that contains experimentally-derived human mrna-rbp pairs. for simplicity, ’rbp+’ refers to the set of rna sequences in aura that are recognized by a specific rbp. for example cpeb1+ comprises  <dig> rna sequences recognized by cpeb <dig> and pum1+ comprises  <dig> rna sequences recognized by pum <dig>  an aura_dataset with  <dig> rbp+ sets was obtained by focusing on proteins with more than  <dig> associated 3’-utrs  for which meme suite was able to detect binding motifs in a reasonable time. in order to eliminate similar sequences we processed each rbp+ with usearch  <cit>  to cluster sequences with more than 80%  identity. we used one representative from each cluster as the final sequence. by randomly choosing  <dig> human 3’-utrs from the ensembl genome browser  <cit>  we constructed an artificial negative dataset  to complement each rbp+ set. thus for cpeb <dig> the cpeb1+ set comprised  <dig>  binding sequences and 3k- was used as the negative data to train the svm.


pum2_dataset. the pum <dig> data originates from a photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced clip experiment on human embryonic kidney  cells and was downloaded from geo . in the experiment  <cit> ,  <dig> clusters of about  <dig> transcripts were identified and 93% were found within the 3’-utrs. we extracted all 3’-utrs in such way that each cluster appeared only once, creating the pum2+ dataset which contains  <dig> positive 3’-utrs recognized by pum <dig>  the results of an rna-seq experiment  <cit>  involving the same hek <dig> cells under the same conditions were used as the negative results. two replicates are available on geo: gsm <dig> and gsm <dig>  to avoid the loss of data we merged these results and downloaded the sequences from the ensembl genome browser . hence the pum2- dataset comprises  <dig> of the  <dig> negative 3’-utrs that did not bind to pum <dig> 


iago2_dataset. the independent ago <dig>  dataset is not present in aura and was downloaded from geo as replicates of the par-clip experiment  <cit> : gsm <dig> and gsm <dig>  merging the results and downloading the sequences from the ensembl genome browser  resolved  <dig> sequences recognized by ago <dig>  the rna-seq dataset discussed above was again used to provide the negative 3’-utrs  <cit> . after subtracting the transcripts recognized by ago <dig>  the negative dataset comprised  <dig> sequences.

a short description of the dataset compositions, the number of proteins in each dataset and the sum of the target sequences. a more detailed description of the aura_dataset and the number of target sequences used for training can be found in table  <dig>  first and second column.

 with y
i
∈{+ <dig> −1}: a sequence x

 belongs to the positive class with label + <dig>  or to the negative class with label − <dig> . the goal of a svm is to find a discrimination function, which divides the two classes in such way that the label for new entries can be predicted. in this work, we use the freely available svm package libsvm  <cit> .

feature extraction and representation
pssm
motifs are sequence patterns in rna, dna or proteins that can be modeled by position-specific scoring matrices . meme suite  <cit>  can detect motifs in sets of sequences, create the corresponding pssm and compute the motif score scoreŝi which is calculated for each m-length subsequence ŝi=bi+1…bi+m, i∈{ <dig> ...,n−m+1} along the n-length rna sequence b1b2…b
j
…b
n
 where b
j
 is the ribonucleotide at the j-th position and m the motif length m≤n: 

  scoreŝi=∑k=1mpssm 

where pssm returns the matrix value for b∈{a,u,c,g} and position k.

we searched for significant motifs in each rbp+ set using the following meme suite property settings: mod = zoops, minw =  <dig> and maxw =  <dig> 

tetranucleotides
we codified the individual rna sequence compositions using the frequency of all possible tetranucleotides . the corresponding feature reported the frequency of each tetranucleotide in the overall rna sequence.

simple secondary structures
we evaluated the following features based on rna secondary structures predicted with rnafold  <cit> : 

 <dig>  predicted folding energy  <cit>  ;

 <dig>  stem density, proportion of paired base pairs  <cit> ;

 <dig>  number of stems  <cit> ;

 <dig>  accessibility, computed by identifying subsequences with at least four consecutive nucleotides in single stranded form, i.e. not part of a stem. we codified these subsequences using tetranucleotides. the corresponding feature was set to  <dig> if a specific subsequence was single stranded, but otherwise  <dig>  additional file 3: figure s <dig> illustrates the calculation of the secondary structure features.

prediction methods
using oli, binding and non-binding rnas for a specific rbp were predicted by applying a svm that described each rna sequence in terms of the frequency of  <dig> features corresponding to all possible tetranucleotide sequences.

olimo extended oli by adding  <dig> pssm-based motif scores. given a specific rbp, we applied a svm to discriminate binding from non-binding rnas, describing each rna sequence using  <dig> features: the tetranucleotide frequencies  and  <dig> pssm-based motif scores calculated for each subsequence in the rna strand. binding sites occur more often than expected by chance on regulated utrs  <cit> . accordingly we represented the binding sites on each rna sequence by the  <dig> highest motif scores.

olimoss extended olimo by adding secondary structure features. given a specific rbp, we applied a svm to discriminate binding from non-binding rnas by describing each rna sequence with a total of  <dig> features: the tetranucleotide frequencies and pssm scores described above, plus three additional secondary structure properties  and  <dig> features representing the accessibility of different tetranucleotides.

evaluation and comparison
the models were analysed in two evaluations. in evaluation evaluation  <dig>  we tested the predictive capability of oli, olimo and olimoss against the aura_dataset, each rbp+ set assisted with the negative 3k- counterpart, and calculated the auc and precision, as previously reported with rnacontext and rpiseq. finally we applied the wilcoxon signed-rank test  to the aucs to compare their performance. in order to assess the significance of the resulting aucs, we calculated their confidence interval: we carried out the experiment  <dig> times, each time generating the 3k- set using  <dig> randomly selected and non-overlapping ensembl transcripts. furthermore, we investigated whether the trained protein-specific svms discriminate between the different rbp+ sets. to address this, we applied each model to the rbp+ sets of the other  <dig> rbps and calculated the sensitivity. we also used iago <dig> to test the predictions of our ago2-models. evaluation evaluation  <dig> tested the performance of oli, olimo and olimoss on pum2+ compared to pum2- and 3k-. we calculated auc and precision, and compared the predictions  with rnacontext and rpiseq.

a short description and a definition of the performance metrics can be found in the additional file  <dig> 

in each evaluation we carried out a 10-fold cross validation. within each training fold, a grid-search identified the best value for the linear kernel parameter c according to the highest matthews correlation coefficient  to evaluate the classification ability. an n-fold cross-validation is preferable to a leave-one-out cross-validation because it has been used in most previous reports  <cit>  and is recommended for calculations that are demanding on computer resources  <cit> . moreover, muppirala et al. and pancaldi and bähler reported no differences in the predictions compared to the use of leave-one-out cross-validation. all the scripts we describe were implemented in python. the oversampling algorithm smote was used to balance the data and was applied only to the training folds. we sought binding motifs with meme suite in each of the  <dig> training folds separately to avoid circularity and to ensure a fair testing. here, we only applied the linear kernel because the balancing with smote was implemented in the input space and the linear kernel must therefore be used. other kernels would require the training data to be balanced in each kernel-defined feature-space, and this transformation was not the goal of the paper.

RESULTS

additional file 3: table s <dig> reports the confidence intervals of the resulting aucs at a confidence level of α= <dig> . the p-values of the wilcoxon signed-rank test are presented in additional file 3: table s <dig>  and the precisions for each method, calculated at a threshold of  <dig> , can be found in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

oli and olimo achieved the highest mean auc of  <dig> , followed by rnacontext with a mean of  <dig> . rpiseq-svm and rpiseq-rf performed the worst, with means of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a significant difference between the prediction of oli and olimoss  and between the prediction of olimo and olimoss  but there was no significant difference between oli and olimo . all three approaches showed a statistically significant difference in prediction compared to rpiseq-rf. rnacontext showed statistically significant differences in prediction to rpiseq-svm  and rpiseq-rf. similarly, oli and olimo are statistically different from rnacontext  and from both rpiseq methods . all approaches were characterized by low precision values, the mean ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . rnacontext  and olimoss  outperformed both rpiseq-svm  and rpiseq-rf . the computation of the precision at a threshold of  <dig>  does not show the overall potential of the methods, which is instead best visualized by pr curves.

oli was compared in detail with rnacontext, because the latter was the most competitive with our novel methods. to visualize the classification ability of the two approaches, we plotted the pr curve  and the receiver operating characteristic  curve  for each rbp. the optimum area of a pr curve is the upper-right corner, and both methods struggled to reach it for proteins cpeb <dig> and pabp. oli outperformed rnacontext for most rbps and the curve was visibly shifted over the y-axis. regarding the roc curves, both approaches were competitive, essentially reflecting the aucs listed in table  <dig> 

the performance of our approaches was protein dependent. for several rbps , oli and olimo achieved an auc≥ <dig> , whereas in other cases , the performance was worse . this is possibly because each rbp binds in a specific way and the adopted features may not always capture the particular binding property.

for example, argonaute family members are known to bind small mirnas which finally bind the target sequences. this complementarity is probably easier to detect in the binding sequences, which could explain the good performances of ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig>  similarly, protein quaking  binds to rna targets containing the core sequence -yuaay-  <cit> . when applied to the poly-binding protein , which predominantly binds to the poly-a tails of mrnas, our methods generated nearly random results. one explanatory hypothesis is that the poly-a sequence alone is not enough to discriminate between positive and negative data.

we anticipated that as more binding information is provided, such as motif score and secondary structure, better discrimination would be achieved between binding and non-binding rna. however, we observed the opposite phenomenon in our models. olimoss achieved only low aucs and a statistically significant difference in prediction, confirming it was the weakest of our approaches. we concluded that the secondary structure features were not necessary, perhaps because enough binding information is already included in the tetranucleotide representation. furthermore, the accessibility feature can also have a limited impact because some rbps bind rna backbones rather than accessible ribonucleotides. generally the tetranucleotide-based features were able to capture the specific binding properties. figure  <dig> shows the performance of oli on the aura_dataset.

we also tested the widely-used normalization of tetranucleotide features, as applied in rpiseq, but this did not improve either the auc or the precision . normalizing the tetranucleotide features can disrupt the frequency of important tetranucleotides and thus reduce discrimination within our dataset. further improvements can instead be achieved by applying other rebalancing techniques. for example, the undersampling of 3k- in combination with the oversampling algorithm smote for the positive data, proved to be a better choice for smaller datasets with fewer than  <dig> sequences . an alternative balancing technique is the assignment of different weights to different classes during training . however, weighting the classes did not influence the predictions achieved using our data.

here we used the tetranucleotide frequencies to code the rna sequences. these features are identical to rpiseq. previously published studies use dinucleotides  <cit>  to identify contact profiles from rbp-rna complexes and wang et al.  <cit>  chose sequences, three nucleotides in length, to codify rna. in our case, using k-mers of length two and four gave similar prediction results, whereas using k-mers larger than six reduced the prediction ability of the classifiers and caused much higher calculation times for the balancing algorithm smote. using longer k-mers to represent the rna sequences forces most of the frequencies to be  <dig>  a similar result was observed in our dataset for rnas shorter than  <dig> nucleotides: sensitivity and specificity are unbalanced because most of the tetranucleotide frequencies are zero. interestingly, highly unbalanced datasets, with many more negative sequences than positives, did not have such an impact. the calculated auc remained stable even if the negative dataset size increased substantially. this suggests that even in an unbalanced scenario, the proportion of correctly predicted sequences remains balanced.

although applying the same sequence features, our protein-specific discrimination  was more useful that the general discrimination approach of rpiseq. because proteins utilise different binding mechanisms, a protein-specific model can catch binding preferences better than a less specific one. specific models can be created by detecting and isolating important and protein-dependent features. to gain more insight, we calculated the information gain  <cit>  for each tetranucleotide. the  <dig> most important features for each protein, ranked by their information gain, can be found in the additional file 3: table s <dig>  an interesting observation is that the highest values are assigned to uuuu, aaaa, auuu and uuua  and that the  <dig> highest-ranked tetranucleotides do not really vary across the proteins. the protein-dependent tetranucleotides only begin to differ in the lower ranks. we argue that these results can be used as the first criteria to select important features and to create more specific models.

the binding mechanism is not the only factor that differs between proteins and needs individual treatment. the datasets themselves also differ, because they reflect different experiments with various cell-lines under diverse conditions. one single model created using such a mix of information and diversity, cannot reasonably be expected to achieve accuracy, whereas protein-dependent training can catch the precious information contained in each dataset.

to investigate whether the protein-specific svms discriminate between the different rbp+ sets, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity for each rbp model. assuming each rna in the rbp+ sets as a positive , we can calculate the sensitivity of the model against the binding partners of the other rbps. the results are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  interestingly, many protein models detected binding sequences  in the qki, ago1- <dig> and tnrc6a-c datasets. auf <dig> detected binding transcripts in all rbp+ sets. the opposite phenomenon was observed for cpeb <dig> and pabp: the sensitivities never exceed  <dig> . transcripts have binding sites for several rbps, therefore it is possible to find targets also within the other rbp+ sets. moreover, by assuming that the shared and overlapping targets are positives and the non-shared targets are negatives, we calculated the sensitivities and specificities for all the models. the results can be found in additional file 3: table s <dig> for the sensitivities and additional file 3: table s <dig> for the specificities. as expected, the sensitivities in this test are high, because the binding partners have been detected also in the other rbp+ sets, and almost all of the models achieved low specificities on rbp+ sets ago1- <dig> and tnrc6a-c. the number of overlaps between the bound sequences in the different rbp+ sets can be found in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

inferring rbp-rna binding based only on the presence of specific binding motifs may underestimate the complexity of the binding process for some rbps, explaining the lower performance of rnacontext in the pr curves. the same applies in the case of olimo, which did not improve the predictions even when motif-based features were included. motif-based features may work better when known and experimentally verified motifs can be used. considering that high-throughput methods produce large amounts of data, even a small change in the precision of an in silico method results in the better prediction of binding rnas.

the iago2_dataset was used to test our ago2-models independently: oli performed best , followed by olimo  and olimoss . these values are promising and show that models trained on experimental data can be useful to discriminate between target sequences. the availability of further high-throughput data will make it possible to test more of our models independently.

the table shows the performance for each method on two different datasets: one with pum2+ and experimental negatives pum2- and one with pum2+ and randomly selected 3’-utrs 3k-. auc and precision  values were calculated for a 10-fold cross validation.

in order to determine the ability of a model based on real negative data to find binding partners among general 3’-utr sequences, we tested the models generated by the 10-fold cross validation with pum2+ and pum2-, substituting the negatives of each of the  <dig> sets with negatives from 3k-. evidently an approach based on real data should also be able to distinguish between real positives and randomly-selected sequences. furthermore, the task should be easier than distinguishing real negatives because the precision increased . this is consistent with the fact that all the methods perform better when the negatives are sourced from the 3k- dataset. similarly, to determine the ability to distinguish between real positives and real negatives, we considered the models trained with pum2+ and 3k- and tested their performance against pum2-. in this case, the precision declined to  <dig> . therefore a complete dataset obtained by in vivo experiments can be used effectively to train svms with simple sequence features.

the evaluation highlights the importance of negative training data, which is rarely available but is necessary to build accurate models. because the performance values of all methods tested on pum2- and 3k- are correlated with a pearson coefficient of  <dig>  , random sequences can provide a good approximation if no experimental negatives are available. they can also be used to determine the relative performance of the methods, as shown in evaluation evaluation  <dig> 

finally, when training with pum2-, the difference in precision is  <dig>  between oli and rnacontext and  <dig>  between oli and rpiseq-svm. as discussed under evaluation evaluation  <dig>  even a small change in precision is important. if we consider  <dig> rnas, an increase in precision of  <dig>  results in the correct classification of an additional  <dig> rna sequences. figure  <dig> shows the pr curve for oli and rnacontext on pum2+ and pum2-.

CONCLUSIONS
the correct characterization of rbp-rna interactions in silico provides important data for the assignment of protein functions, which currently requires either in vivo and in vitro laboratory experiments. we applied svms to experimental datasets and attempted to predict rna targets for different rbps. we initially described the rna sequences in three different ways:  the oli method, which uses tetranucleotides as features;  the olimo method, which also incorporates motif scores from automatically-detected binding motifs; and  the olimoss method, which extends olimo by also including secondary structure features. we compared the predictions achieved using our methods with those generated by rnacontext and rpiseq. oli and olimo performed better than olimoss and rpiseq and when applying the same nucleotide-based features oli outperformed rpiseq, supporting our decision to train svms for each rbp separately. binding motifs alone were not discriminative enough on our datasets, as shown by the higher precision of oli and olimo compared to rnacontext. further comparisons showed that models trained on randomly-chosen rna sequences performed better than those trained on experimentally-detected non-binding sequences. experimental data can therefore be used to train an svm with tetranucleotide frequency features, which can then be used to predict interactions with other rna sequences.

an ideal method should predict rbp interactions in the absence of existing binding data. thus we are aware of a limitation in our proposed work: interactions can only be predicted when at least one experimental dataset for an rbp exists. this goal still remains challenging. future work may include the incorporation of accessibility features calculated according to nucleotide solvent accessibility  <cit>  and not only, as in our case, by the tetranucleotide single-stranded form, as well as the creation of protein-dependent models trained with pre-selected rbp-specific features.

we conclude that simple sequence information, such as tetranucleotide representation within an rna sequence, in combination with experimental binding data, can be used effectively to construct accurate predictive models. however, the choice of negative training examples is important. they can be approximated using random sequences if real data are not available, but ideally they should be derived from the same experiment, under the same conditions, and using the same cell line. only under these conditions would computational methods be able to capture specific binding phenomena to identify the precise discriminative properties of a given protein.
