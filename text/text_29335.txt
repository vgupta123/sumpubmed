BACKGROUND
bupleurum chinense dc., a perennial herb native to china, belongs to the umbelliferae family and the genus bupleurum l. this herb is used worldwide for medicinal purposes, but is especially common in china, japan, and south korea  <cit> . in traditional chinese medicine, the roots of b. chinense and other bupleurum species are known as chinese thorowax roots , or "chaihu" in chinese. for more than  <dig>   <dig> years these roots have been used for their anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and anti-hepatotoxic effects in the treatment of common colds, fever, influenza, hepatitis, malaria, and menoxenia  <cit> . the major bioactive components of radix bupleuri are the saikosaponins , which belong to the oleanane-type triterpene saponins. although more than  <dig> monomer sss have been isolated from radix bupleuri  <cit> , only ss-a, ss-b <dig>  ss-c, and ss-d have been pharmacologically examined  <cit> , because of the low ss content   <cit> . different monomer sss have been reported to exhibit different predominant pharmacological effects. for example, among the sss isolated from b. falcatum, ss-a and ss-d, but not ss-c, have anti-inflammatory activities  <cit> . whereas ss-c has no correlation with cell growth inhibition, other sss can inhibit cell growth, as well as induce cancer cell differentiation and apoptosis. hence, ss-c may have the potential for therapeutic angiogenesis, but is unsuitable for cancer therapy  <cit> . roots derived from various bupleurum species such as b. chinense, b. scorzonerifolium, b. falcatum, and b. kaoi, have been widely used in various medicinal decoctions. the content and proportion of the monomer sss are extremely diverse in these medicinal materials. the concentration and composition of the sss in the roots is even more complex when studied in combination with diverse planting and harvesting environments and different management methods.

the ability to control the ss content of these medicinal materials by up-regulating the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the different ss monomers or by using bio-engineering techniques would greatly improve their reliability. to be able to attempt this, an understanding of ss biosynthesis is required  <cit> . the putative ss biosynthetic pathway in b. chinense is shown in figure  <dig>  this pathway is based on previous studies on the biosynthetic pathway of other triterpene saponins in some plant species  <cit> , as well as the pathways of sss in b. falcatum  <cit>  and b. kaoi  <cit> . the putative ss biosynthetic pathway initiates the isoprenoid pathway, mediates the cyclization of oxidosqualene, and then undergoes some modifications of oxidation, glycosylation, and other secondary transformations. finally, the formation of the various monomer sss is completed. the cdna of β-amylase  that catalyzes the formation of β-amyrin has been cloned in b. kaoi  <cit> , and two different cdnas that may encode different isoforms of β-as have been cloned in b. chinense. recently, these clones have been characterized in our laboratory . in our previous studies, the cdnas that encode enzymes involved upstream of the ss biosynthetic pathway in b. chinense have also been cloned  <cit> ]. the biosynthetic pathways of the other saponins are not fully understood. similarly, the reactions downstream of the ss biosynthetic pathway after the cyclization of β-amyrin remain largely unknown. one proposal involves oxidization/hydroxylation and glycosyl transfer catalyzed by specific cytochrome p450s and uridine diphosphate  glycosyltransferases , respectively  <cit> ]. to date, no p <dig> or ugt genes involved in ss biosynthesis have been identified in b. chinense or in other ss-producing plants. to the best of our knowledge, only a few p450s and ugts have been verified to be involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins  <cit> ; recent reviews in  <cit> ]. this situation is inconsistent with the fact that saponins are widely distributed in plants  <cit> . the biosynthetic pathway of the saponins still has to be clarified.

studies have shown that the sequencing and analysis of expressed sequence tags , combined with genetic and phytochemical methods are effective tools for discovering novel genes in non-model plants  <cit> ]. some genes involved in natural product biosynthetic pathways have been identified via est analyses  <cit> ]. the  <dig> pyrosequencing technique, with its advantages of throughput, read length, and accuracy, can greatly accelerate the discovery of novel genes in non-model organisms  <cit> ]. candidate genes involved in the metabolic pathways of natural products have been identified using the  <dig> pyrosequencing technique. these natural products usually have diverse and important functions in plant growth, and are also invaluable as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. examples of such important natural products include triterpene saponins in american ginseng  <cit>  and glycyrrhiza uralensis  <cit> , flavonoids in artemisia annua  <cit> , alkaloids in huperzia serrata and phlegmariurus carinatus  <cit> , and cyanogenic glucosides in zygaena filipendulae  <cit> . the specific functions of the candidate genes reported in the abovementioned studies are still being validated. even so, the  <dig> pyrosequencing is still the preferred choice for novel gene discovery, especially for members of known gene families.

in the present study,  <dig>   <dig> high-quality  reads from a cdna library of b. chinense were obtained using the roche gs flx titanium platform. the reads were assembled into  <dig>   <dig> unique sequences comprising  <dig>   <dig> contigs and  <dig>   <dig> singletons. only  <dig> ests were identical with those derived from the  <dig>   <dig> ests generated in our previous study from a b. chinense root cdna library using the sanger sequencing method  <cit>  and the bupleurum sequences from ncbi. a total of  <dig> p450s and  <dig> glycosyltransferases  including  <dig> ugts were screened. the assembled full-length cdnas of the p450s and ugts were verified. several partial cdnas of the p450s and ugts were extended to full length by 5' and/or 3' rapid amplification of cdna ends . the candidate p450s and ugts that may participate in ss biosynthesis were screened via methyl jasmonate  inducibility and tissue-specific expression pattern experiments. these p450s and ugts will be the targets of further research on ss biosynthesis.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly
a one-quarter plate run using the  <dig> gs flx titanium platform was carried out on the cdna that was generated by smart technology from the equivalent pooled total rna from b. chinense roots, germinating seeds, and seedlings. a total of  <dig>   <dig> hq reads with an average sequence length of  <dig> bp were obtained from  <dig>   <dig> raw reads after the initial quality filtering step . the hq reads were then assembled into  <dig>   <dig> contigs and  <dig>   <dig> singletons. the consensuses , equal to  <dig>  mb of sequence data, had an average length of  <dig> bp with a range of 43- <dig>   <dig> bp. the sequencing and assembly statistics are shown in table  <dig>  the size distribution of the consensuses is shown in figure  <dig> 

functional annotation
the assembled  <dig>   <dig> unique sequences were successively compared with the sequences in three major public protein databases  using the basic local alignment search tool x  algorithm with an e-value cutoff of < 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig>   <dig> unique sequences, accounting for  <dig> % of the total unique sequences, were annotated . in our previous study, a total of  <dig>   <dig> cdna clones derived from a b. chinense root cdna library were 5' single-pass-sequenced using the sanger sequencing method  <cit> . in the present study, the unique sequences obtained via  <dig> pyrosequencing were compared with the  <dig>   <dig> ests and with an additional  <dig> ests downloaded from genbank. the unique sequences were also compared with the  <dig> bupleurum protein-encoded sequences from genbank. only  <dig> unique sequences from the  <dig> dataset overlapped with other ests. therefore, the  <dig> dataset must contain thousands of novel genes for the genus bupleurum .

a sum of  <dig>   <dig>  of the total unique sequences were further annotated based on their similarity with the arabidopsis information resource  proteins, before gene ontology  terms were assigned. the categories of molecular function, biological process, and cellular component are shown in additional file 2: functional annotations of the  <dig> unique sequences of b. chinense based on go categories. a high percentage of the unique sequences were annotated to hydrolases, kinases, and transferases in the molecular function category. for the biological process category, a large number of genes were annotated to metabolic processes, response to abiotic or biotic stimulus, and response to stress. hence, the  <dig> dataset should substantially aid the discovery of novel genes involved in the metabolism of sss and other secondary natural products. a total of  <dig>   <dig> unique sequences were annotated using kegg;  <dig>   <dig> of them were related to metabolism,  <dig> to the metabolism of terpenoids polyketides, and  <dig> to the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites .

candidate genes related to ss backbone biosynthesis
similar to other triterpene glycoside pathways, the ss biosynthetic pathway is generally divided into three stages . the first stage is the formation of the isoprene units isopentenyl pyrophosphate  and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate , the second is the formation of the triterpene skeleton , and the third stage is the modification of the skeleton. based on our current knowledge, no definite sequence features can be used to identify the specific p450s and ugts involved in the modification of the triterpene skeleton. therefore, the unique sequences that were annotated as responsible for the formation of the ss backbones in the first two stages of the pathway were first screened. as shown in table  <dig>  except for mevalonate-5-diphosphate decarboxylase , the putative genes that encode all the enzymes for the biosynthesis of ss backbones were found. triterpenoids are generally considered to be formed in the cytoplasm via the mevalonate  pathway. however, recent reports have demonstrated that the cytosolic mva pathway and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate  pathway may mutually communicate through the regulatory role of isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase , which maintains the appropriate levels of ipp and dmapp in the cytoplasm and plastids  <cit> . consequently, three putative genes that encode the enzymes involved in the mep pathway were also searched for and found in the  <dig> dataset. these genes were dxp reductoisomerase , mep cytidylyltransferase , and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase .

full-length cdna cloning of p450s and ugts
the p450s constitute one of the biggest gene families in plant genomes, accounting for more than 1% of the total gene annotations in each plant species  <cit> . in our unique sequences, a total of  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons were annotated as p450s accounting for about  <dig> % of the  <dig>   <dig> unique sequences . according to the best-hit description in the annotation databases, the p450s encoded by these unique sequences were classified into  <dig> families and  <dig> subfamilies; four of the p450s were unclassified . two annotated full-length p450s were verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . three p450s that had single terminals in the  <dig> dataset, and two p450s derived from our previous cdna library, were extended by race pcr. as a result, seven full-length p450s were obtained. the seven full-length p450s were further analyzed using blastx in ncbi. the deduced amino acid sequences were aligned with homologous arabidopsis thaliana p450s and some function-identified p450s from other species. a neighbor-joining tree was constructed based on the alignment . the seven p450s were named by nelson  <cit>  as bccyp82t <dig>  bccyp90d <dig>  bccyp707a <dig>  bccyp716a <dig>  bccyp736a <dig>  bccyp736a <dig>  and bccyp712f <dig> 

gts are a superfamily of enzymes in plants. gts catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. currently, there are  <dig> families and some non-classified sequences at the superfamily level http://www.cazy.org/glycosyltransferases.html. glycosylation is one of the major factors that determine the bioactivity and bioavailability of natural plant products, such as flavonoids and terpenoids.

the gts that are responsible for the glycosylation of natural products are members of the family  <dig> gts, the ugts  <cit> . in our unique sequences, there were  <dig> annotated gts  of which  <dig> were ugts. all the gts were classified into  <dig> categories according to the go term assignment . two full-length ugts were verified by rt-pcr. four partial ugts from the  <dig> dataset and one ugt derived from our previous cdna library were extended by race pcr, resulting in seven full-length ugts tentatively named bcugt <dig>  bcugt <dig>  bcugt <dig>  bcugt <dig>  bcugt <dig>  bcugt <dig>  and bcugt <dig>  the deduced amino acid sequences of these seven ugts were aligned with some ugts from other species, and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed based on the alignment . the ugts from the other plant species were selected based on the blastx results for the seven ugts cloned in the present study. most of these ugts were function identified. gmsgt <dig>  and mtgt <dig>  were identified with functions in the biosynthesis of saponins. asugt709a <dig>  and csugt <dig>  may be involved in the formation of triterpenoids and monoterpenoids, respectively, because both were registered in genbank and relevant unpublished papers. the others were identified as flavonoid gts. although the functions of a ugt cannot be deduced from the sequence alignment alone, the functions of bcugt <dig>  and bcugt <dig>  were first verified in the course of ss-related ugt identification. both of these ugts had high sequence similarities with previously identified terpene gts.

expression characteristics of p450s and ugts
the pentacyclic triterpenoid sss are considered to be synthesized using β-amyrin as a substrate via a series of reactions thought to be catalyzed by p450s and ugts. meja is known to induce the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites, such as ginsenoside  <cit>  and sss  <cit> . meja also up-regulates metabolite-related enzyme genes  <cit> . the expression of genes involved in ss skeleton biosynthesis has not been studied in meja treatment experiments. however, the expression of β-as is up-regulated with increased accumulation of sss in the hairy roots of b. falcatum using altered culture media  <cit> . therefore, in the present study, meja-treated adventitious roots of b. chinense were used to investigate the expression of β-as, and to screen the putative p450s and ugts involved in ss biosynthesis. based on the classifications and read abundances, a total of  <dig> p450s and  <dig> ugts were selected for meja inducibility analyses using real-time pcr with actin as the internal reference gene. all selected p450s belonged to the two clans, cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  that include all known triterpenes and sterol hydroxylases. as shown in figure  <dig>  β-as expression increased about fourfold in meja-treated adventitious roots compared with in the control. all p450s and ugts assayed were up-regulated by meja, whereas the elevated fold expressions of four p450s and eight ugts were more than that of β-as. therefore, the four p450s  and the eight ugts  were further assayed for their tissue-specific expression patterns.

five tissues, roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, were used to analyze the tissue-specific expression patterns of the abovementioned four p450s and eight ugts. real-time pcr analysis was performed using β-tubulin as the internal reference gene. as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the expression patterns of two p450s  and three ugts  showed strong similarities with that of β-as. p450- <dig> was obtained from our previous cdna library. p450- <dig>  ugt- <dig>  ugt- <dig>  and ugt- <dig> were all obtained from the  <dig> dataset. the sequence similarity results suggest that ugt- <dig> and ugt- <dig> are members of the ugt <dig> family, whereas ugt- <dig> belongs to the ugt <dig> family. these p450s and ugts can be considered as candidate genes encoding enzymes responsible for ss biosynthesis, and require further study.

discussion
the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology is regarded as a prime choice for novel gene discovery in non-model organisms. in the present study, this technology was applied with the main goal of identifying the p450s and ugts involved in the biosynthesis of sss in b. chinense. in previous reports, cyp93e <dig> from glycine max was shown to hydroxylate β-amyrin and sophoradiol with the formation of olean-12-ene-3β, 24-diol, and soyasapogenol b, respectively  <cit> . cyp88d <dig> from glycyrrhiza uralensis was identified as a β-amyrin 11-oxidase  <cit> . ugt73k <dig> and ugt71g <dig> from medicago truncatula  <cit>  and ugt74m <dig> from saponaria vaccaria  <cit>  have been identified to be involved in triterpene biosynthesis. thus far, no p <dig> or ugt were identified in ss-producing plant species. all known triterpenes and sterol hydroxylases have been classified into the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clans  <cit> . in our  <dig> dataset,  <dig> unique sequences in  <dig> families and  <dig> unique sequences in  <dig> families belong to the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clans, respectively. of these  <dig> were ugts representing nine families, namely, ugt <dig>  ugt <dig>  ugt <dig>  ugt <dig>  ugt <dig>  ugt <dig>  ugt <dig>  ugt <dig>  and ugt <dig>  our data provide a promising opportunity for identifying the p450s and ugts involved in ss biosynthesis. in the present study,  <dig> unique sequences of p450s and  <dig> ugts were screened. two p450s and three ugts that may be involved in the biosynthesis of sss, based on meja inducibility and tissue-specific expression patterns, were found. they are currently being identified by their heterologous expression in escherichia coli or yeast, as well as by their overexpression and gene silencing in transgenic b. chinense plants. more candidate ss-related p450s and ugts may be found among the annotated p450s and ugts. along with the identified p450s and ugts, our results may also be helpful in revealing the formation mechanism of diverse monomer sss and in elucidating other saponin biosynthetic pathways.

in the present study, the full-length cdna clones of seven p450s and seven ugts were obtained. two of the p450s belong to the cyp <dig> family and the other five p450s belong to the cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig> families. the catalytic function of the cyp <dig> family is still unknown. recent reports have shown that cyp736b in grapes may be involved in the host response to xylella fastidiosa infection  <cit> . cyp736a <dig> in soybean is also highly co-expressed with genes involved in root and rhizobium-induced nodule development . cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> are part of the cyp <dig> clan family. some members of the cyp <dig> family were found to mediate plant-specific alkaloid pathways, for example, cyp82e <dig> and cyp82e5v <dig> in tobacco were identified with nicotine n-demethylase activity  <cit> . arabidopsis cyp82c <dig> and cyp82c <dig> are 8-methoxypsoralen hydroxylases that mediate modifications of toxic furanocoumarin  <cit> . however, a recent study has shown that cyp82g <dig> functions in the terpene pathway as a dmnt/tmtt - <dig>  8-dimethyl- <dig>   <dig>  7-nonatriene/c16-homoterpene - <dig>   <dig>  12-trimethyltrideca- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  11-tetraene) homoterpene synthase  <cit> . cyp <dig> and the cyp93s may catalyze successive steps in the same pathway in different plants  <cit> . one of the cyp93s, cyp93e <dig>  was found to participate in the triterpene pathway  <cit> . cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig> are part of the cyp <dig> clan family. cyp <dig> is the first family of cyps required for brassinosteroid synthesis. cyp90bs, -as, -ds, and -cs successively act in the brassinosteroid pathway  <cit> . the cyp707s inactivate aba via 8'-hydroxylation to form phaseic acid, and thereby, play a key role in the regulation of aba-mediated physiological processes  <cit> . the cyp716s do not have a known function, but their closest non-plant relatives, cyp26as, are involved in the hydroxylation of retinoic acid  <cit> . based on sequence similarity, cyp <dig> was close to cyp <dig> in the neighbor-joining tree . a previous study using a broader range of plants also showed some overlap in cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  this overlap is evidence of the extensive divergence occurring within this subset of genes in the cyp <dig> clan. cyp725a has been shown to act on taxane diterpenoids  <cit> . however, it is still unclear whether these two families share similar functions. the seven ugts for which full-length cdnas were generated in the present study have sequence similarities with members of different ugt families. this finding implied that the ugts identified in the present study may be members of these different ugt families. based on the neighbor-joining tree , bcugt <dig> was found to be close to members of the ugt <dig> family, in particular to gmsgt <dig> , mtgt <dig>  and gegt ; bcugt <dig> was close to a ugt <dig> member. bcugt <dig> and bcugt <dig> were also close to ugt <dig> members and to other ugts without definite family ascriptions. bcugt <dig> was close to a ugt <dig> member. previous studies  <cit>  have indicated that ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> belong to the same orthologous group, og <dig>  <cit> . ugt73b <dig> was shown to exhibit flavonoid 7-o-glucosyltransferase activity  <cit> , ugt73a <dig> has been reported to exhibit  <dig>  2', 4', 6'-tetrahydroxy chalcone 4'-glucosyltransferase activity  <cit> , and ugt90a <dig> was shown to exhibit luteolin 4'/7-o-glucosyltransferase activity  <cit> . bcugt <dig> and bcugt <dig> may belong to the ugt <dig> family because they have sequence similarities with ugt94s. previous studies have shown that ugt94d <dig> has udp-glucose: sesaminol 2'-o-glucoside-o-glucosyltransferase activity and ugt94f <dig> has anthocyanin 3-o-glucoside-2''-o-glucosyltransferase activity  <cit> . although the definite functions of the seven p450s and seven ugts from b. chinense identified in the present study still have to be verified by further experiments, the isolation of their full-length cdnas will be significant for elucidating their biofunctions in the growth and development of b. chinense.

the biosynthesis and regulation of bioactive components was the main focus of the present study on b. chinense. in addition to sss isolated from members of the genus bupleurum that exhibit pharmacological activity, several other groups of secondary metabolites with relevant biological activity have been characterized, for example, polysaccharides with anti-ulcer activity and lignans with anti-proliferative activity  <cit> . genes involved in polysaccharides and lignans were searched for in the present  <dig> dataset. for example, enzymes encoded by genes related to polysaccharides include -beta-d-glucan synthase, alpha- <dig>  6-xylosyltransferase, alpha--galacturonosyltransferase, xylan  <dig>  4-beta-xylosidase, etc.  <cit>  and enzymes encoded by the genes related to lignans, are phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate-coa ligase, hydroxycinnamoyl coa: shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase, isoeugenol synthase, and dirigent protein oxidase  <cit> . therefore, the present  <dig> dataset is valuable not only in the exploration of genes involved in ss biosynthesis, but also for the discovery of genes involved in other bioactive secondary metabolites derived from the genus of bupleurum. additionally, the agronomical traits of b. chinense, such as drought resistance, have been investigated  <cit> . in our  <dig> dataset,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> unique sequences were annotated as related to responses to abiotic or biotic stimulus and to stress, respectively. these annotations were based on the go terms. these sequence data may be beneficial to further molecular studies on the stress response of b. chinense. further, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> unique sequences were annotated with transcription factor activity and signal transduction, respectively. some of these sequences may play roles in regulating ss metabolism and the stress response. these unique sequences deserve to be cloned and functionally analyzed in future studies.

currently the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology is considered as a rapid and economical method to generate high-quantity sequence data. although a large number of  <dig> reads were obtained by a quarter run in the present study, nearly a quarter of the ests from the sanger-sequenced  <dig>   <dig> clones from our previous cdna library were not sequenced. the different cdna libraries  and the fact that only the 5' end of the cdna was sequenced in the sanger sequencing may explain, to some extent, this difference. in some reports that compared  <dig> pyrosequencing and traditional sanger sequencing, bias was found because of differences in the two sequencing methods  <cit> . combinations of these two methods have been used in some studies:  to generate a high number of good-quality ests with improved clustering analysis and with more full-length sequences  <cit> ;  to obtain a less biased method for the identification and diversity analysis of microbes and fungi  <cit> ; and  to assemble genome sequences  <cit> . recently, radix bupleuri has aroused global interest, especially in europe . however, studies on the molecular biology of bupleurum are still limited. more transcriptome data will facilitate a deeper understanding and enable the rapid development of radix bupleuri applications.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a  <dig> dataset of b. chinense was analyzed. these data represent a substantial contribution to the functional genetic studies of b. chinense. the identification of enzymes involved in ss biosynthesis may enable the regulation and improvement of ss production levels in plants or in microbial hosts by metabolic engineering. almost all of the known genes that encoded enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the ss backbones were explored. a total of  <dig> p <dig> and  <dig> gt unique sequences containing  <dig> ugts were obtained. these sequences will be invaluable to the elucidation of the ss biosynthetic pathway and to the exploration of the molecular mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of different monomer sss. the full-length cdnas of seven of the p450s and seven of the ugts from our present  <dig> dataset and previous sanger's sequencing data were cloned using the race method. this procedure may help in elucidating the functions of the p450s and ugts. meja inducibility and tissue-specific expression pattern experiments were used to screen two p450s and three ugts that may be involved in ss biosynthesis.
