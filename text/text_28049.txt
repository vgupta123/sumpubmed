BACKGROUND
theobroma cacao  is the source of the world's cocoa butter and cocoa powder, key ingredients in chocolate. t. cacao is a short, tropical tree that is grown in multiple countries including côte d'ivoire, ghana, indonesia, nigeria, brazil, cameroon, ecuador, colombia, mexico, and papua new guinea where cacao beans are an important cash crop. world cocoa production was estimated to be  <dig> million tons in  <dig> and had an annual estimated average growth rate of  <dig> % from  <dig> to  <dig> . cacao bean production is currently under threat from several sources including a rise in the incidence of fungal diseases including black pod, frosty pod, and witches' broom  <cit> . in order to address these issues, multiple genetic and genomic efforts have been initiated in the last decade to identify genetic markers and genes that could be utilized to accelerate the release of robust t. cacao cultivars  <cit> . these efforts have recently culminated in whole-genome shotgun assemblies of the genomes of two t. cacao cultivars: criollo  <cit>  and matina 1- <dig>  <cit> . these genome sequences will greatly assist t. cacao breeding efforts  <cit>  as well as contribute to our basic knowledge of tree and dicot biology through comparisons with a growing collection of genome sequences from trees and dicotyledonous plants.

there are primarily two approaches to sequence a genome: the bac-by-bac approach where libraries of clones with large inserts  are randomly sequenced and ordered relative to a minimum tile path  such as has been used to sequence the genomes of rice and maize  <cit> , or the whole- genome shotgun  sequencing of genomic dna, carried out without cloning, from genomic libraries with multiple insert sizes as implemented for western poplar, grapevine, and sorghum genomes  <cit> . in the bac-by-bac approach, the mtp is obtained through the construction of a physical map via dna fingerprinting: each bac clone is digested with restriction enzymes  <cit>  and contigs are generated based upon shared dna signatures. dna signatures, comprised of a bac's repertoire of fragment sizes, are determined by algorithms incorporated into software such as fingerprinted contigs   <cit> . fpc-based physical maps can be validated and improved by incorporating information obtained by hybridizing bac clones with specific probes which can include probes that have been genetically mapped; the ordering of contigs on physical maps can thus be facilitated by using genetically derived mapping information  <cit> . furthermore, bac ends can be sequenced and serve as well-spaced markers for determining the accuracy of shotgun read assemblies. using a strategy that integrates physical mapping and genetic mapping reduces the number of chimeric contigs and increases overall confidence in the final assembly . in any strategy, it is important to have a high quality reference assembly available for annotation and re-sequencing endeavours.

in this study, we describe the construction of a bac-based integrated genetic-physical map of the genome of t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> . we also demonstrate the utility of the map by comparing it with other plant genomes. this map serves as an important reference for t. cacao genomes being sequenced; it can be used to establish the accuracy of those genome sequences prior to their use for applications such as snp discovery, rnaseq, chipseq, and other techniques.

RESULTS
physical map construction
t. cacao genomic dna was first cleaved into large fragments for cloning into vectors that could accommodate large inserts. three different restriction endonucleases, hindiii, mboi, and ecori, were utilized to partially digest genomic dna samples which were then used to construct three t. cacao bac libraries  using methods that have been previously described  <cit> . these libraries were then used to construct the physical map.  <dig>  clones were arrayed for each of the three complementary bac libraries, which we estimate provides 10× genome coverage and, therefore, these libraries collectively represent approximately  <dig> t. cacao genome equivalents. the average insert size was  <dig> kb and the clones are arrayed in  <dig>  384-well microtiter plates as summarized in table  <dig> 

*assumes  <dig> mbp genome size.

in order to determine bac order and orientation, we characterized all bacs in the libraries using high resolution restriction band fingerprinting. using previously published methods  <cit> , a total of  <dig>  bac clones from all three bac libraries were subjected to high information content fingerprinting  after addition of control clones in the e <dig> and h <dig> wells of the 96-well offset to maintain data uniformity. data comprising fragment sizes were captured by capillary electrophoresis  <cit> . after removal of clones containing less than  <dig> fragments or greater than  <dig> fragments and empty vectors,  <dig>  clones , with an average of  <dig>  fragments per clone, were successfully assigned a digitized fingerprint  to use for assembly carried out using the fpc software  <cit> .

to obtain a high-quality commensurate build, fingerprints from all three bac libraries were combined for contig assembly using a stringent cutoff of  <dig> e- <dig> and a tolerance of  <dig>  this base assembly resulted in  <dig> contigs harbouring  <dig>  clones and  <dig>  singletons. the dqer function of fpc was run to identify and break up contigs comprised of greater than 10% questionable clones . the singles-to-ends function and the ends-to-ends function were run at a final cutoff of  <dig> e- <dig> using automatic merges to join singletons to contig ends and contigs to contigs, respectively. additionally, manual curation of the physical map was performed based on results collected from the integration of the genetic recombination map and synteny mapping  at a cutoff as low as  <dig> e- <dig>  assuming a cumulative average insert size of  <dig> kb and an estimated t. cacao genome size of  <dig> mbp, the consensus band  estimation equates to an average of  <dig>  bp per band.

the final t. cacao physical map totaled  <dig> contigs containing  <dig>  bacs  and  <dig>  singletons  . of the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> contigs are comprised of fewer than  <dig> bacs,  <dig> contigs are comprised of between  <dig> and  <dig> bacs,  <dig> others of between  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> are comprised of greater than  <dig> bacs per contig . size estimations of consensus bands were converted to base pairs in the summary of the t. cacao physical map assembly and for estimates of contig lengths .

integration of genetic markers and sequence tagged sites  onto the physical map
to assimilate genetic and physical maps and integrate conserved ortholog set  sequences onto the t. cacao physical framework, overgo probes were designed from genetically mapped simple-sequence repeat markers  originating from est sequences  <cit>  and  <cit>  cosii sequences derived from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , respectively. the remaining  <dig> cosii sequences were placed onto the physical map and their linkage groups inferred by contig placement. overgo probes were anchored to the physical map using a 3-dimensional pooled hybridization approach following the method of fang et al.  <cit> . briefly, overgo probes were pooled using a pooling strategy in which  <dig> probes were hybridized to the three t. cacao bac libraries. based on single location integration, 96% of the markers were accurately placed on the physical map and these markers were used to anchor and orient  <dig> contigs as  <dig> pseudomolecules . where ordered contig ends fail to overlap, an arbitrary  <dig> kb addition was made and annotated as gaps between contigs and is visualized using the cmap comparative map viewer ; this gap addition was not calculated as part of any physical map statistics. a framework file was created in fpc to anchor bac contigs to chromosomes using results obtained from integration of  <dig> genetic recombination markers  <cit>  . the framework function of fpc was used to anchor bac contigs to chromosomes, as well as order and renumber them, which resulted in  <dig> contigs assigned, ordered, and oriented to the ten t. cacao linkage groups;  <dig> contigs remained unanchored, most of which contain a small number of bacs. specific contigs  are described in additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig> 

dense minimum tile path  selection for bac-end sequencing
bac-end sequences  corresponding to a fingerprint in the physical map serve as long-range, paired sequence anchor points which can be used to facilitate alignments to other genomes and integration of draft sequence contigs. ideally, a pair of bac-end sequences assigned to each bac in the physical map will provide a robust array of sequence tagged sites  for draft genome anchoring, genome exploitation, etc. however, the t. cacao physical map assembled into a very few, long contigs built from nearly 30× bac coverage; therefore, we determined a bes for every clone was not necessary but rather an end sequence every 7- <dig> kb. for the t. cacao physical map, the median number of consensus band  units per bac was  <dig> cbs, the average bac insert size was  <dig> kb, and the desired distance in bp between sequence anchor points was  <dig> kb. the resulting n-value was approximately  <dig> cb units and  <dig>  bacs with an end approximately every 7cb units apart were selected for bac-end sequencing. a total of  <dig>  sequencing reactions were performed that included both ends,  <dig>   of which were successfully trimmed and a total of  <dig>  of those were part of a successful pair. this moderately dense array of bac-end sequences will serve as sequence anchor points for comparative genomics and long-range sequence pairs for draft genome sequence integration.

alignment of the t. cacao physical map with v. vinifera, p. trichocarpa, and a. thaliana genomes
as more genomes are sequenced, comparative genomics is becoming a more readily applicable approach to studying genomic architecture, gene function, and genome evolution across species. recently, argout et al.  <cit>  published findings into the paleohistory of t. cacao  by looking at orthologous genes between t. cacao  chromosomes and vitis vinifera, arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichoptera, glycine max, and circa papaya. we used a similar synteny-based approach to gain insight into t. cacao  genome structure and evolutionary history; we compared the genetically integrated t. cacao physical map to the v. vinifera, p. trichocarpa, and a. thaliana genomes using  <dig>  bac-end sequence anchor points tied to  <dig> genetically anchored bac contigs,  <dig> genetically mapped framework markers,  <dig> mapped atcosii markers, and  <dig> atcosii anchored markers for each of the alignments below. the alignments and visualizations were performed with the symap software  <cit> . a detailed review of the synteny computing algorithm used can be found in soderlund et al.  <cit> ; briefly, the bes and marker sequences were filtered for repeats aligned to the corresponding genomes. a total of  <dig>  bes hits anchored to  <dig> fingerprint contigs, covering approximately 73%  of the v. vinifera genome , were aligned between the t. cacao physical map and the v. vinifera genome. the average percent identity  of the alignment of the bes-associated contigs ranged from 74% to 100%. a total of  <dig> synteny blocks were identified,  <dig> of which were less than  <dig> mbp long,  <dig> were between  <dig> and  <dig> mbp in length, and  <dig> were greater than  <dig> mbp . with p. trichocarpa,  <dig>  bes hits and  <dig> marker sequences were anchored to the  <dig> contigs that could be aligned, covering approximately 78%  of the p. trichocarpa genome . the percent identity of the bes alignments with p. trichocarpa ranged from 75% to 100%. a total of  <dig> synteny blocks were identified,  <dig> of which were less than  <dig> mbp, another  <dig> were between  <dig> and  <dig> mbp, and  <dig> were greater than  <dig> mbp . approximately 44%  of the a. thaliana genome was covered  as a result of  <dig>  bes hits and  <dig> marker sequences anchored to  <dig> contigs. it is important to note here that even though  <dig> cosii sequences were used as anchor points, only  <dig> of them were considered a homologous match in a. thaliana; the unmatched cosii sequences likely were flanked by non-homologous bes that did not meet the criteria set to be considered a syntenic region. the percent identity of the sequence matches between a. thaliana and t. cacao ranged from 75% to 95% and a total of  <dig> synteny blocks were identified,  <dig> of which were less than  <dig> mbp,  <dig> ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> mbp, and  <dig> were greater than  <dig> mbp . alignments of our physical map to these three genomes are consistent with t. cacao's closest relative being p. trichocarpa, followed by v. vinifera and then a. thaliana, the most distant relative of the three. structural details are discussed below.

*double coverage is the fraction of sequence that is covered by more than one synteny block.

1total anchors  with genetic marker subset in parentheses.

in order to visualize synteny relationships, whole-genome dot plots and circos plots  <cit>  were created to visualize genome structure and collinearity between t. cacao and the three other genomes . as described above, the most syntenic blocks were identified between t. cacao and p. trichocarpa followed by those with v. vinifera, and then a. thaliana. the longest stretch of collinearity is between t. cacao and p. trichocarpa and spans  <dig>  mbp; the longest span with v. vinifera is  <dig>  mbp and with a. thaliana is  <dig> mbp. there are several duplications of t. cacao chromosomal segments that can be visualized within the three target genomes. for example, regions of t. cacao chromosome  <dig> appear to be duplicated in a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa, and v. vinifera . the longest duplicated synteny block between t. cacao and a. thaliana is a duplicated segment on t. cacao chromosome  <dig> that spans  <dig>  cb units or approximately  <dig>  mbp and aligns to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of a. thaliana. a more distal segment of t. cacao chromosome  <dig> is duplicated in p. trichocarpa on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and is estimated to be approximately  <dig>  mbp . a segment of t. cacao chromosome  <dig> is present in three copies in v. vinifera  that span a total of  <dig>  cb units or approximately  <dig>  mbp. argout et al. proposed an evolutionary scenario that suggests the 10-chromosome structure of t. cacao was formed from an intermediate ancestor with  <dig> chromosomes through eleven chromosome fusion events  <cit> . we observed evidence of chromosomal fusion events as well through comparisons of the t. cacao physical map to v. vinifera, p.trichoptera, and a. thaliana as shown in the circos plots . for example, p. trichocarpachromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> may have fused to form t. cacao  chromosome  <dig>  v. vinifera chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> may have fused to form t. cacao chromosome  <dig> .

to determine if a physical map is sufficient for investigating ancestral paleo-polyploidy events, we looked at the detailed alignments between t. cacao and v. vinifera chromosomes. we observed that v. vinifera chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> align to t. cacao  chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and 4; v. vinifera chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> align to t. cacao  chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and 5; v. vinifera chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> align to t. cacao chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and 8; v. vinifera chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> align to t. cacao  <dig>   <dig>  and 9; v. vinifera chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> align to t. cacao  <dig>   <dig>  and 5; v. vinifera chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> align to t. cacao  <dig>   <dig>  and 10; v. vinifera chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> align to t. cacao  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . these observations are nearly identical to those of argout et al.  <cit>  and also confirm evidence of ancestral triplicated chromosome groups reported for v. vinifera  <cit> . these results suggest that a bac-based physical map with relatively evenly spaced bac-end sequence anchor points can have immediate utility, depending on the amount of collinearity that exists between it and other genomes of interest, for interrogating agriculturally important genes and gene families and elucidating evolutionary origins prior to the availability of a high quality reference genome.

alignment of the t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> physical map with the t. cacao cv. criollo genome assembly
after the t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> physical map was constructed the t. cacao cv. criollo genome assembly became available  <cit> . alignment of the t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> physical map with the t. cacao cv. criollo genome assembly  <cit>  identified a total of  <dig>  bes matches and  <dig> marker sequences anchored to  <dig> contigs covering approximately 65%  of the criollo genome . the average percent identity of the sequence matches ranged from 83% to 99%. a total of  <dig> synteny blocks were identified,  <dig> of which were less than  <dig> mbp in length,  <dig> ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> mbp, and  <dig> were longer than  <dig> mbp . alignment of the genome sequences of the matina 1- <dig> cultivar with those of the criollo cultivar revealed a very close alignment, as expected, which validates the comparative genomic software and methodology.

while alignment of the matina 1- <dig> anchored physical map contigs to the criollo genome sequence revealed long stretches of collinear sequence , there were also many instances of rearrangements by either inversion or translocation and instances of duplication . segments of criollo chromosome  <dig> are duplicated on matina 1- <dig> chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  for example. there are also segments of criollo chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> that are duplicated on matina 1- <dig> chromosome  <dig> and chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. there are segments on criollo chromosome  <dig> that are duplicated on matina 1- <dig> chromosome  <dig>  there is a segment of criollo chromosome  <dig> that is duplicated on matina 1- <dig> chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  an example of an inverted genomic segment resides near the telomere on criollo chromosome  <dig>  and another on chromosome  <dig> . two potential sequence translocations are located on criollo chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  reside on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> in matina 1- <dig>  respectively, but further support is necessary to confirm these due to low resolution in these areas. as an example of using a comparative approach to elucidate the structure of the matina 1- <dig> genome, figure 5c illustrates duplicated sequences from matina 1- <dig> linkage group  <dig> that match sequences on criollo chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  figure 5b shows a 2d comparison of matina 1- <dig> chromosome  <dig> and criollo chromosome  <dig>  these chromosomes are apparently highly similar in sequence but quite rearranged. the longest conserved segment of contiguous collinearity between the sequences of the two cultivars occurs on chromosome  <dig> and spans approximately  <dig>  mbp. the most non-congruent chromosome between the two cultivars is chromosome  <dig> and the most rearranged is chromosome  <dig>  investigating these structural differences could reveal the underlying biological mechanisms that directed these events from an evolutionary standpoint. assembly accuracy of both the matina 1- <dig> physical map and the criollo draft assembly should also be verified.

integration of unanchored contigs using collinearity with other genomes
in an effort to improve the t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> physical map, we examined structural similarities found in the genomes of related species that might suggest possible linkage group assignments for unanchored contigs in the map. unincorporated matina 1- <dig> fpc contigs were assessed for linkage group assignment based on anchoring to regions of the v. vinifera, p. trichocarpa, a. thaliana, and t. cacao cv. criollo chromosomes where other t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> anchored bac contigs were aligned. these alignments resulted in linkage group predictions for  <dig> unanchored contigs . as more genomes are sequenced, a comparative approach to refining existing physical maps will become more effective.

discussion
overview of the cacao physical map
we constructed three bac libraries together representing ~30× coverage of the t. cacao genome  and used them to create the first whole-genome physical map for t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> . this map is genetically anchored and enables cacao cultivar improvement through efforts such as positional cloning and region-specific analysis through sub-genome sequencing . the map also aids in assembly of reference genomes, gap-filling, and independent assessment of assembly accuracy. and, in addition to protein-coding regions, bacs harbor genomic segments such as untranslated regions , promotor/regulatory elements, and introns that are important in functional genomics studies. a bac-based physical map is thus not just an interim solution or a step in the process of sequencing a genome but a viable resource for utilizing a complete genome sequence once ascertained. physical maps have been reported recently for gossypium raimondii  <cit> , aquilegia formosa  <cit> , wheat chromosomes  <cit> , maize  <cit> , brachypodium distachyon  <cit> , oncorhynchus mykiss  <cit> , prunus persica  <cit> , and glycine max  <cit> .

our t. cacao physical map assembly is highly ordered and tightly anchored to a moderately dense genetic recombination map, resides in  <dig> anchored contigs, and represents 82% of the t. cacao genome as computed by assuming a total genome size of  <dig> mbp. however, estimated genome sizes for t. cacao range from  <dig> mbp to  <dig> mbp as determined using reassociation kinetics, flow cytometry  <cit> , or genome assembly  <cit> . once the true size of the genome of t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> is known, our physical map statistics may require adjustment. availability of a high-density genetic recombination map  <cit>  was critical to our success in ordering and orienting bac contigs and subsequently assigning contigs to chromosomes. we hybridized  <dig> genetically mapped ssr markers to the bac contigs. only  <dig> of these mapped markers hybridized to more than one contig signifying low copy-number, accuracy of the genetic map through additional evidence in the independent physical map build, and accuracy of the bac assembly. several of these markers flank qtl loci and therefore provide immediate templates for sequencing pools of high priority bacs to identify candidate genes for further investigation . these mapped marker sequences also serve as sequence anchor points for use in comparative genome studies.

using other genomes to assess and improve the t. cacao physical map and discover biological insights
each newly available genome assembly, especially those from species distantly related to model organisms, improves the resolution of genome biology and evolution. exploration of evolving genome architecture through synteny analysis upon the release of a new genome has become a standard experiment in which a new window into a clade is opened. new genome assemblies are, however, incomplete. gaps, chimeric joins, and unresolvable repeat-induced compressions are unavoidable. one way to identify these errors and improve an assembly is to use related genomes as a guide.

comparative genomics has evolved rapidly over the last decade. more genomes acting as reference sequences and the advancement of computational algorithms and visualization software has facilitated a turnkey approach. at the same time, aligning physical maps to sequenced genomes has become increasingly useful. for example, fang et al. constructed a physical map for aquilegia formosa, a species in a unique clade of basal eudicots that is being utilized as a new model system for studying floral variation, adaptive radiation, and evolution, and used a comparative approach to gain insight into the evolutionary lineages between a. formosa and v. vinifera  <cit> . gu et al. created a physical map of brachypodium distachyon and compared it to rice and wheat; they observed whole-genome duplication events in relation to rice that were caused by paleotetraploidy and a broad spectrum of other evolutionary events between the wheat and b. distachyon genomes  <cit> . in short, a physical map serves as a distinct line of non-sequence-based evidence as well as an adjunct to a draft genome sequence during the biological discovery process.

in our comparative genome analysis, we used the symap software to align the t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> physical map to a. thaliana, v. vinifera, and p. trichocarpa genome sequences to gain insight into the structure and evolutionary history of t. cacao as well as to improve the physical map assembly. not surprisingly, we found more syntenic blocks between the ten chromosomes of t. cacao and the  <dig> chromosomes of p. trichocarpa than between the ten chromosomes of t. cacao and the  <dig> chromosomes of grape. the main difference was in the length of the syntenic blocks;  <dig> syntenic blocks between t. cacao and p. trichocarpa were greater than  <dig> mbp in length, whereas there were only  <dig> syntenic blocks longer than  <dig> mbp between t. cacao and v. vinifera. the number of short  collinear regions differed between these comparisons as well . alignment to the a. thaliana genome produced the fewest syntenic blocks as expected since a. thaliana is the most evolutionarily distant species of the three used for our comparisons.

structural and evolutionary implications can also be derived from comparisons between physical maps and available genome sequences. collinear genomic segments and duplications can be quickly identified and provide insight into selective pressures and identify regions of the genome for targeted detailed analysis, all without a reference genome. as a result of our use of this approach, we concur that the chromosome fusion events recently reported by argout et al.  <cit>  occurred in the ancient genome structure that led to the ten-chromosome structure we see today. additionally, this comparative approach is sufficient to identify and confirm ancestral triplicated chromosomal groups recently reported for v. vinifera  <cit> .

the utility of the cacao physical map with regard to cacao genome sequences
even as more and more genomes are sequenced de novo and sequencing strategies evolve, i.e. there is less reliance on sanger-based sequencing and second-generation sequencing platforms shift in chemistry and read-lengths, there are still inherent problems with assembly and resolution of distal regions of complex eukaryotic genomes. mate-pair sequencing libraries with long insert sizes such as bacs and fosmids provide the necessary linking information and long-range contiguity for resolving repetitive dna and scaffolding draft contigs. as noted previously, a physical map is an important adjunct to de novo genome sequencing projects and serves as an independent genome assembly that is composed of a very different data type. bac fingerprints assembled  with an integrated dense array of paired-end sequences and genetic markers can be used to check for errors and to corroborate the accuracy of a draft genome assembled using a whole-genome sequencing  strategy. the physical map can also serve as a template for gap-filling and targeted sub-genome re-sequencing of bac pools  <cit> .

the physical map we present here can be of great utility in advancing draft genome sequences of theobroma cacao into high quality reference genomes. for example, comparison of the cv. matina 1- <dig> physical map assemblies to the cv. criollo pseudomolecules revealed a high degree of collinear genomic segments . however, there are still many regions of structural difference between these two draft sequences such as sequence inversions and translocations. there are also regions of discontiguous alignments between the physical map and draft sequence. we speculate that these differences may be the result of underlying biological differences between cultivars, misassemblies in either the matina 1- <dig> physical map or the criollo whole-genome draft assembly, gaps resulting from unresolved repetitive dna, or a lack of dense bes in particular contigs in the physical map. for any of these possibilities, the matina 1- <dig> physical map can serve as a template for confirming/resolving assembly differences and provide resolution in regions of low quality or underrepresentation in the draft genome assemblies through targeted pcr or sub-genome sequencing through bac pools.

CONCLUSIONS
the three bac libraries, bac-end sequences, and the genetically integrated physical map for t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> resulting from this study are important resources for functional exploitation and enhancement of theobroma cacao that are expected to complement and augment genome sequencing efforts. the results obtained from the comparative analyses with a. thaliana, v. vinifera, and p. trichocarpa suggest that genome assemblies from distantly related species can be used to gain insights into genome structure and evolutionary history as well as conserved functional genomic sites and to improve a physical map assembly. these resources will also serve as the templates for refinement of t. cacao genome sequences through gap-filling, targeted re-sequencing, and resolution of repetitive dna arrays through long-range contiguity.
