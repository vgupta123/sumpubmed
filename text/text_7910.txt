BACKGROUND
the rise in antibiotic resistance amongst bacterial pathogens around the world is causing alarm, with the possibility of a “post-antibiotic era” in the 21st century  <cit> . one broadly antibiotic-resistant bacterium that is increasing in prevalence in nosocomial and community-acquired infections is stenotrophomonas maltophilia. some of the infections associated with s. maltophilia include pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, endocarditis, catheter-related bacteremia/septicemia and acute exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  <cit> . preventing infections caused by this bacterium is difficult, as s. maltophilia is ubiquitous in the environment and can be easily spread in nosocomial settings by health care providers and cough-generated aerosols  <cit> . treatment of s. maltophilia infections is problematic due to its innate resistance to a broad array of antibiotics such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, β-lactams, macrolides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines and polymyxin. new treatment strategies are thus required in order to successfully combat this extremely drug-resistant bacterium.

one promising treatment strategy is the clinical application of bacteriophages, also known as phage therapy, to selectively kill infecting bacteria . phage therapy has been used for nearly a century in some eastern european countries, but was largely abandoned in the west during the 1940s due to the advent of broad-spectrum antibiotics. however, with the rise in antibiotic resistance threatening the traditionally effective treatment of bacterial infections, rigorous research into the efficacious use of phage therapy has been renewed. recent studies utilizing phage therapy in animal models  and human clinical trials  have shown that phages can be a successful treatment option. in order to obtain fda approval for the clinical use of phages, proof is required to show that phage genomes do not encode toxins or other undesirable genes that could potentially enhance bacterial virulence  <cit> . therefore, all s. maltophilia-specific phages that are to be considered for use in a phage therapy strategy must be fully characterized through complete genome sequencing and analysis to ensure they are safe for use in human clinical trials.

recent research has led to the isolation and characterization of several different s. maltophilia phages, including a jumbo phage phisma <dig> , a filamentous phage phisma <dig> with a genome size of  <dig>  kb encoding only seven genes, but one of these being a zot toxin  <cit> , a virulent phage smp <dig> that exhibits homology to phage t <dig>  <cit> , a lytic phage ime <dig> with an unusually large burst size  <cit> , a t7-like phage ime <dig> specific to s. maltophilia  <cit> , a p2-like phage smp <dig> whose genome exhibits sequence homology to prophages in xanthomonas species  <cit> , and three other novel, small filamentous phages phisma  <dig>  phisma <dig> and phishp <dig>  <cit> . twenty-two phages specific for different stenotrophomonas species, including the well-characterized temperate phage s <dig>  have also recently been isolated  <cit> . additional pertinent research has shown that non-interactive lactococcus phages can easily penetrate the biofilms produced by s. maltophilia  <cit> . here we describe the isolation and characterization of two novel s. maltophilia phages dlp <dig> and dlp <dig>  these phages are related to three previously characterized pseudomonas aeruginosa phages and have the unusual characteristic of cross-taxonomic order infectivity, the ability to use strains of both s. maltophilia and p. aeruginosa as hosts for phage propagation.

RESULTS
isolation, host range and morphology
using s. maltophilia strain d <dig>  phages dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> were isolated from red deer river sediment and soil planted with blue flax , respectively. in contrast to the characterized s. maltophilia phages isolated from clinical settings, sewage samples and lysogenic bacteria , dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> are the first phages to be isolated from sediment and soil.

phage dlp <dig> exhibits a unique plaque development that was previously identified in phages kl <dig> and ah <dig> that target bacteria of the burkholderia cepacia complex  <cit> . as with kl <dig> and ah <dig>  stocks of dlp <dig> can be concentrated , but use of such high titre stocks results in plates with no plaques. instead, when lower titres  are used, and the plates are incubated at 30 °c for at least 24 h, dlp <dig> plaque development occurs . individual plaques for dlp <dig> are turbid with no distinct boarders and a diameter of  <dig> -1 mm, averaging  <dig>  mm. this contrasts the plaque development of phage dlp <dig>  which produces clearing at high titres and clearly defined plaques at lower titres following 16 h incubation at 30 °c . plaque sizes for dlp <dig> are clear with distinct boarders and a diameter  <dig> - <dig>  mm, averaging  <dig>  mm.fig.  <dig> development and morphology of dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> plaques. phages were plated in half-strength luria-bertani  agar overlays with 16 h liquid culture of stenotrophomonas maltophilia d <dig>  plates were incubated at 30 °c and photographed at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h. turbid dlp <dig> plaques were difficult to visualize until after 24 h of growth, whereas clear, well-defined dlp <dig> plaques were observed after 16 h



dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> are classified in the order caudovirales and the family siphoviridae due to their morphological characteristics observed using electron microscopy. the dlp <dig> phage has a long, non-contractile tail of approximately 175 nm in length and a capsid size of approximately 70 nm in diameter . phage dlp <dig> is larger, with a non-contractile tail of approximately 205 nm and a capsid size of approximately 70 nm in diameter .fig.  <dig> dlp <dig>  and dlp <dig>  phage morphology. phages were stained with 4 % uranyl acetate and visualized at  <dig> -fold magnification by transmission electron microscopy. scale bars represent 50 nm. both siphoviridae family phages were of similar size, although the tail of dlp <dig>  was shorter than that of dlp <dig> 



both dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> have a moderate host range within the s. maltophilia strains tested, with the ability to infect eight and nine out of  <dig> strains, respectively . both phages also have a unique ability to infect across bacterial taxonomic orders, with each phage capable of infecting two separate p. aeruginosa strains each . this is an interesting finding, as bacteriophages are typically thought to be relatively species specific. however, there are examples of bacteriophages that have been shown to lyse bacteria of different genera. for example, some phages originally discovered to infect one genus of cyanobacteria, have also been shown to be able to lyse other cyanobacteria genera . confirmation of successful dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> infection and lysis of p. aeruginosa strains was confirmed with the use of pcr .table  <dig> host range analysis of dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> against stenotrophomonas maltophilia clinical isolates

genome characterization
genomic analysis of phages dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> reveals they are closely related phages. initially, a comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphisms  of dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> ecori-digested genomic dna shows similar banding patterns with slight band differences between  <dig> - <dig>  2- <dig> and  <dig> kbp . dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> similarity was confirmed by the results of the whole genome sequencing using the illumina platform . a genome map for dlp <dig> and dlp <dig>  shows the modular similarity of the two phages, as well as their genetic similarity with respect to their genes and genome sizes. however, complete genome sequencing also demonstrates the crudeness of rflp analysis. the dlp <dig> genome contains  <dig> ecori sites, whereas the dlp <dig> genome possesses  <dig> ecori sites. phage dlp <dig> possesses five dna insertions of 29 bp in ecori fragment 6869- <dig>  40 bp in fragment 9910- <dig> , 50 bp in fragment  <dig> - <dig> , 129 bp in fragment  <dig> - <dig>  and 118 bp in fragment  <dig> - <dig> . phage dlp <dig> possesses three dna insertions of 40 bp in ecori fragment  <dig> - <dig> , 87 bp in fragment  <dig> - <dig> , and 5 bp in fragment  <dig> - <dig> . in addition, phage dlp <dig> has an extra ecori site at base pair  <dig> due to a point mutation. phages dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> were found to be  <dig>  % identical over  <dig>  % of their genomes. however, this comparison still denotes considerable variation between the two phage genomic sequences. a blastn comparison indicates that the two genomes share  <dig>  identical base pairs out of  <dig>  aligned base pairs , with  <dig> gaps. the similarity of dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> to each other, and to their closest relative pseudomonas phage vb_pae-kakheti <dig> , is illustrated in fig.  <dig>  a circos plot of a nucmer comparison of the three phages.fig.  <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism of dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> genomic dna. 1 μg of phage genomic dna was digested 5 min with ecori and separated on a 1 % agarose gel. l:  <dig> kb plus dna ladder . several differences in banding pattern between the genomic dnas isolated from the two phages is apparent

the dlp <dig> genome is  <dig>  base pairs  in length, with a gc content of  <dig>  %. dlp <dig> is predicted to encode  <dig> proteins with the most common start codon being atg, although a ttg start codon is used for gp <dig>  gp <dig> and gp <dig> . besides phage dlp <dig>  phage dlp <dig> is most closely related to the siphovirus pseudomonas phage vb_pae-kakheti <dig>    <cit> . dlp <dig> and pa <dig> phages are similar with respect to genome length , gc content  and predicted number of proteins   <cit> . blastn comparison of dlp <dig> and pa <dig> shows a 98 % identity over 94 % of the genome. the genome of dlp <dig> also shows high similarity to phages pa <dig>   <cit>  and vb_paes_sch_ab <dig>    <cit> . again, this represents a significant amount of genetic variation, with  <dig> gaps required to complete the genomic alignment with pa <dig>   <dig> gaps required to align pa <dig>  and  <dig> gaps required to align ab <dig>  suggesting that although these phages belong to the same family, they are not merely variants of one another. the predicted proteins of dlp <dig> are similar to those found in phages pa <dig>  pa <dig> and ab26; though dlp <dig> proteins gp <dig>  gp <dig> and gp <dig> are unique in that they are not similar to any proteins found in pa <dig>  pa <dig> and ab <dig> . the dlp <dig> protein gp <dig> is related to gp <dig> of the erwinia phage vb_eamp-s <dig>  the gp <dig> protein is related to the hypothetical protein x805_ <dig> of sphaerotilus natans subsp. natans dsm  <dig>  which is a filamentous bacterium known to contribute to the stability of pseudomonas sp. colonies at low concentrations  <cit> . the vsr endonuclease encoded by gp <dig> is most homologous to a gene found in the burkholderia phage kl <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> bacteriophage dlp <dig> genome annotation

the dlp <dig> genome is  <dig>  bp in length, with a gc content of  <dig>  %. dlp <dig> is predicted to encode  <dig> proteins with the most common start codon being atg, although a ttg start codon is used for gp <dig> and gp <dig>  and a gtg start codon is used for gp <dig> and gp <dig> . phage dlp <dig> is also related to pseudomonas phage pa <dig> . these two phages are similar with respect to genome length , gc content  and predicted number of proteins   <cit> . blastn comparison of the dlp <dig> and pa <dig> genomes shows a 97 % identity over 95 % of the genome. the blastn results also reveals dlp <dig> to be similar to pseudomonas phages pa <dig>   <cit>  and ab <dig>   <cit> . phage dlp <dig> gene content differs from phages pa <dig>  pa <dig> and ab <dig> in predicted proteins gp <dig> and gp <dig> . dlp <dig> protein gp <dig> is most closely related to the uncharacterized protein mam_ <dig> of the serratia phage Φmam <dig>  similar to dlp <dig>  the dlp <dig> gp <dig> protein is related to the hypothetical protein x805_ <dig> of sphaerotilus natans subsp. natans dsm  <dig> table  <dig> bacteriophage dlp <dig> genome annotation

analysis of modules
the proteins identified in dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> can be classified into three general categories: lysis, virion morphogenesis  and dna replication/repair. the orfs of dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> are syntenic, and the predicted proteins are similar with only a few variations from each other , yet these two phages exhibit two completely different plaque development characteristics . it is also of interest to note that no genes encoding known or putative virulence factors were discovered in the genomes of phages dlp <dig> and dlp <dig>  or any other related phages in this family.

lysis
genes putatively encoding the lysis proteins holin, lysin, rz, rz <dig> and a hypothetical protein have been identified in dlp <dig>  a blastp search of predicted protein gp <dig> shows that it is similar to a phage protein family found in lysis cassettes that was identified in phage pa <dig>  a blastp search also showed gp <dig> to be a putative holin protein similar to those identified in pa <dig> and pa <dig>  analysis of this gp <dig> protein with tmhmm revealed it has two transmembrane domains; thus, gp <dig> is a predicted to be a class ii holin  <cit> . gene gp <dig> is nearly identical to the endolysin of pa <dig>  gp <dig> and gp <dig> proteins are similar to the rz protein of ab <dig> and rz <dig> of pa <dig> respectively. the rz protein is a class ii inner membrane protein with an n-terminal domain and rz <dig> is a proline-rich outer membrane lipoprotein  <cit> . the rz/rz <dig> proteins contribute to lysis by fusing to the inner and outer membranes following holin and endolysin activity to facilitate phage release  <cit> . the gp <dig> protein is predicted to contain a single n-terminal transmembrane domain, a characteristic of rz proteins  <cit> . lipop analysis of gp <dig> shows a signal peptidase ii cleavage site between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  resulting in a  <dig> amino acid protein with  <dig> proline residues   <cit> .

the lysis predicted proteins identified in dlp <dig> are similar to those also identified in phage dlp <dig>  however, there are also some differences. the gp <dig> of dlp <dig> is most closely related to orf <dig> of pa <dig> and also the endolysin protein in pa <dig>  like dlp <dig>  gp <dig> of dlp <dig> is similar to the rz protein of phage ab <dig>  although dlp <dig> gp <dig> required manual annotation, blastp analysis showed it is most closely related to rz <dig> of ab <dig>  rather than phage pa <dig>  however, lipop analysis revealed the identical signal peptidase ii cleavage site as for phage dlp <dig> gp <dig>  analysis of the lysis module for dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> did not reveal why phage dlp <dig> exhibits delayed plaque development when compared to phage dlp <dig>  one hypothesis is that gp <dig> of dlp <dig>  encoding a hypothetical protein not found in dlp <dig> , contributes to the delayed plaque development of dlp <dig>  however, until a definitive function for the dlp <dig> gp32-encoded protein can be established, this hypothesis remains unproven.

virion morphogenesis
as discussed above, dlp <dig> is closely related to phage dlp <dig>  and phages pa <dig>  ab <dig> and pa <dig>  whose proteins are generally uncharacterized. blastp analysis of the  <dig> genes involved in virion morphogenesis in dlp <dig> identified  <dig> genes with putative functions: two involved in dna packaging, four involved in capsid morphogenesis and seven involved in tail morphogenesis. the dna packaging proteins gp <dig>  and gp <dig>  are similar to the small terminase subunit of pa <dig> and large terminase subunit of ab <dig> respectively. protein gp <dig> shares a 98 % identity to the portal protein of ab <dig>  although gp <dig> shares 100 % identity to uncharacterized orf <dig> of pa <dig>  it has been assigned a putative function due to its high similarity to the f-like head morphogenesis protein of ab <dig> . gp <dig> shares 100 % identity to the scaffold protein of pa <dig>  the gp <dig> is most similar to orf <dig> of pa <dig>  but its high similarity to the major capsid protein of ab <dig> has allowed a putative function to be assigned to this protein . the seven proteins involved in tail morphogenesis are gp <dig> , gp <dig> , gp <dig> , gp <dig> , gp <dig> , gp <dig>  and gp <dig> . both gp <dig>  closely related to the virion protein of ab <dig>  and gp <dig>  closely related to orf <dig> of pa <dig>  have been assigned putative functions due to their similarities to the head-tail joining protein and minor tail protein of burkholderia phage kl <dig> respectively   <cit> . protein gp <dig> shares a 99 % identity to the major tail protein of pa <dig>  gp <dig> is 100 % identical to orf <dig> of pa <dig>  but has been assigned the putative function of tail chaperonin due to its similarity to ab <dig> tail chaperonin. like gp <dig>  gp <dig> is predicted to be a tail chaperonin protein, and has 100 % identity to the pa <dig> tail chaperonin protein. both gp <dig> and gp <dig> are closely related to the tape measure protein and central tail hub of pa <dig>  respectively. analysis of dlp <dig> with blastp revealed the virion morphogenesis proteins are nearly identical to those of dlp <dig>  with only minor differences .

dna replication and repair
dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> have seven and eight identified proteins, respectively, identified to be involved in dna replication and repair at the same gene position: dna polymerase , replicative clamp , recb exonuclease , reca , mazg , replicative primase/helicase , vsr endonuclease  and dcmp deaminase  . three and two additional proteins were assigned putative functions following bioinformatics analysis, in dlp <dig> and dlp <dig>  respectively, based on their high similarities to known proteins: dead box helicase , recb exonuclease  and a transcriptional regulator  .

blastp analysis for dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> gp <dig> shows it is 99 % identical to a putative dna polymerase in pa <dig>  the replicative clamp of pa <dig> shares a 99 % identity to gp <dig> of dlp <dig> and 95 % identity to gp <dig> of dlp <dig>  in dlp <dig>  gp <dig> is 100 % identical to orf <dig> in pa <dig>  though its putative function was assigned due to its 95 % identity to the recb exonuclease of ab <dig>  gp <dig> in dlp <dig> has 99 % identity to the recb exonuclease of ab <dig>  hhpred analysis of the gp <dig> protein for dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> revealed the proteins are similar to the exonuclease of the λ red recombination complex   <cit> . the reca protein of ab <dig> shares 99 % and 100 % identity to the gp <dig> proteins of dlp <dig> and dlp <dig>  respectively. the protein gp <dig> of dlp <dig>  and dlp <dig>  have been assigned the putative function of transcriptional regulator due to their similarity to the transcriptional regulator of the burkholderia phage kl <dig>  <cit> . the protein gp <dig> for both dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> shares 99 % identity to the replicative primase/helicase found in pa <dig>  both dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> contain a vsr endonuclease , although gp <dig> of dlp <dig> is most similar to kl <dig> vsr endonuclease, whereas gp <dig> of dlp <dig> is most similar to the vsr endonuclease encoded by ab <dig> . the dcmp deaminase  of both phages is most closely related to the dcmp deaminase of pa <dig> . protein gp <dig> of dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> is 100 % identical to orf <dig> of pa <dig>  but a putative function has been assigned in both phages, as gp <dig> is 99 % identical to the dead box helicase protein of ab <dig> for both phages. dead box helicases are vital in rna metabolism, as they function to fold rna molecules into their correct secondary structures and realign rna-protein interactions with the use of atp  <cit> .

a predicted protein of interest in dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> is mazg, which is encoded by gp <dig> in dlp <dig> , and gp <dig> in dlp <dig> . during times of stress in bacteria, the unusual nucleotides pppgpp and ppgpp begin to accumulate, synthesized by the proteins spot and rela respectively  <cit> . amino acid starvation activates rela to synthesize ppgpp, whereas other bacterial stressors such as carbon or nitrogen starvation triggers spot to synthesize pppgpp  <cit> . the pppgpp nucleotide can be converted into ppgpp through the enzyme gppa phosphatase  <cit> . both of these unusual nucleotides are involved in the global response to stressful conditions within the bacteria, though ppgpp is a more potent regulatory nucleotide for growth inhibition  <cit> . mazg fits into this regulatory pathway by depleting the accumulated ppgpp, thus reducing growth inhibition  <cit> . the action of phage-encoded mazg has been of interest to researchers, as many marine phages have been found to encode mazg homologs  <cit> . it has been speculated that phage-encoded mazg operates to reduce the ppgpp pool within stationary-phase infected cells  <cit> , thus enhancing propagation of phage progeny in bacterial cells growing in nutrient limiting conditions. the host bacterium for dlp <dig> and dlp <dig>  s. maltophilia, has been isolated from nutrient-limited environments, such as ultrapure and deionized water  <cit> . the presence of mazg in dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> could potentially offer a competitive advantage over mazg-deficient phages replicating in stationary phase s. maltophilia.

phage relatedness
the two s. maltophila phages dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> differ from each other based upon rflp analysis, dna comparison analysis, protein:protein comparison analysis, the presence of insertions/deletions , genetic synteny, as well as the phenotypic differences presented, which include different host ranges and the timing of plaque formation. based upon these analyses, which include changes to both structural and replication genes and their predicted gene products, we conclude that they are significantly different enough in genetic content and biology to be considered individual phages and not merely variants of one another. there is sufficient genomic, proteomic and biological differences that, although they are related phages, dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> are not  close variants of each other. these differences include  <dig> base pair changes and  <dig> gaps required to align the dna, and three genomic locations where dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> have acquired completely different genes, which originate from entirely different sources . in dlp <dig>  orf  <dig> encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with no known homolog, whereas in dlp <dig>  orf  <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein that is homologous to a gene found in phage pa <dig>  in dlp <dig>  orf  <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein without a homolog, whereas dlp <dig> encodes a protein  <dig> amino acids in length, also with without known homologs. in dlp <dig>  orf  <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein that has homologs in both pa <dig> and pa <dig>  whereas dlp <dig> has no coding dna in this region of its genome. besides these obvious differences, and even though these phages exhibit high average identity across their entire genomes and share almost all proteins, it is still possible that the differences within protein sequences may be associated with the functional differences displayed during bacterial host infection. for example, there are proteins that differ significantly between dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> , such as orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

similar to bacterial relatedness, we suggest that phage relatedness is an arbitrary ideal, and that there are no set guidelines as to what constitutes a phage variant versus what is a different but related phage. in order of relatedness, it is clear that dlp <dig> is most related to dlp <dig>  and then in order of decreasing relatedness, pseudomonas phages pa <dig>  pa <dig>  ab <dig> and finally burkholderia phage kl <dig> . together, they are similar enough to be considered as a siphoviridae sub-family, but how would one delineate them as variants of the same phage versus related phages of a continuum? for example, dlp <dig> is more related to pa <dig> circa orf  <dig>  and more related to pa <dig> and pa <dig> circa orf  <dig>  than dlp <dig>  even though dlp <dig> shares the most homology with dlp <dig>  therefore, how much genetic, proteomic and biological differences must be evident before phages are separated into different “species”? based upon the biological differences , the significant genetic alterations , and the protein level differences  presented, we conclude that each of these phages are different but related phages. these analyses confirm the idea that, although the phage genome dna sequences are syntenic, significant changes have occurred between every member of this sub-family of phages, which is also reflected in the biological differences exhibited by phages dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
although relatively rare, the incidence of phage broad host range specificity at the genera level is being increasingly studied in the food production industry, mainly with the salmonella and escherichia genera . this study is the first to identify and characterize phages capable of infecting pathogenic bacteria across taxonomic orders. dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> are closely related phages that share a high similarity to p. aeruginosa phages vb_pae-kakheti <dig>  vb_paes_sch_ab <dig>  and pa <dig> and lesser similarity to burkholderia phage kl <dig>  phage dlp <dig>  possessing a  <dig>  bp genome, is predicted to encode  <dig> proteins and exhibits a delayed plaque development phenotype. unlike dlp <dig>  phage dlp <dig> exhibits normal plaque development, but possesses a relatively similar genome  <dig>  bp in length. the cause of the delayed plaque development in phage dlp <dig> is yet unknown, but genomic comparison suggests that gene variants encoded by or genes acquired by dlp <dig> may contribute to the observed lysis phenotype differences. the use of phage therapy may be one of the best treatment options for otherwise untreatable drug resistant bacterial infections  <cit> . the genomic characterization of broad-host range phages such as dlp <dig> and dlp <dig> is the first step towards developing an effective phage therapy strategy for s. maltophilia.
