BACKGROUND
the increasing prevalence of multidrug resistant  pathogens causing nosocomial infection constitutes a major health problem  <cit> . klebsiella pneumoniae ranks among the top ten organisms causing blood stream infection, pneumonia and other invasive infections in hospitalized patients in different countries  <cit> . an increasing prevalence of multidrug resistant strains of k. pneumoniae which possess extended spectrum beta-lactamases  enzymes, encoded by plasmid-borne genes which confer resistance to broad spectrum cephalosporins and other antibiotics used to treat serious infection has been widely reported  <cit> . multidrug resistance contributes to unfavourable clinical outcomes, impacts the utilization of hospital resources, increases the burden of effective infection control practice and the overall health economic cost  <cit> .

the prevalence of esbl producing strains of k. pneumoniae differs between countries. in the developing world a recent study from jamaica reported that almost one-fifth of k. pneumoniae isolates at a tertiary referral teaching hospital were esbl producers  <cit> . the presence of esbl-producing gram negative bacilli in hospitals in other caribbean islands also has been reported  <cit> .

this study reports the clonal relationships of mdr esbl producing k. pneumoniae at a jamaican hospital.

RESULTS
the majority of the mdr k. pneumoniae isolates were from urine specimens , blood  and sputum . almost a third  were isolated from children admitted to paediatric wards while 15%  were from intensive care unit  patients. the remaining  <dig> strains were isolated from patients admitted to medical , surgical , special care nursery , orthopaedic  and obstetrics/gynaecological services .

as shown in table  <dig>  in addition to ceftazidime, the majority of the isolates were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  and the aminoglycosides . all  isolates were susceptible to meropenem.

all  <dig>  isolates of mdr k. pneumoniae tested positive for esbl production in the double- disc synergy test and the e-test esbl screen. the e-test esbl screen showed that all isolates  had mic ceftazidime and cefepime >  <dig> μg/ml and >  <dig> μg/ml, respectively. the mics were subsequently determined by the agar gel dilution method which revealed mics ranging from  <dig> - > <dig> μg/ml for ceftazidime and  <dig> - > <dig> μg/ml for cefepime indicating esbl production by all  strains.

the pfge of xbai digests of chromosomal dna from the  <dig> esbl producing k. pneumoniae strains revealed  <dig> banding patterns representing  <dig> genotypes which were designated clones i-x. the most frequently occurring were clones i , ii , iii  and iv . multiple genotypes in comparable frequencies were isolated from specimens from various clinical service areas. the pfge analysis of the mdr k. pneumoniae from patients admitted to different clinical service areas and the banding patterns are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  there were  <dig> cases of mdr k. pneumoniae infection in long stay patients at the hospital. among these, coinfections with multiple genotypes of mdr k. pneumoniae were observed in  <dig> admissions in icu and paediatrics as shown in figure  <dig>  and figure  <dig> , respectively. repeat infections occurred in  <dig> re-admissions after  <dig> months and  <dig> months. in the first case, a different clone was involved while in the other the same clone was identified .

the temporal distribution of the esbl producing k. pneumoniae clones among various hospital services over the  <dig> year period is summarized in table  <dig>  there were  <dig> esbl producing k. pneumoniae isolates during  <dig>   <dig> during  <dig>   <dig> during  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> isolates during  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the mdr esbl k. pneumoniae strains belonging to clones i, ii, iii and ix were isolated from patients in  <dig> different clinical service areas during  <dig>  clones i and ii were first identified in infants on the paediatric wards during july and august and clone i in  <dig> patients on the medical wards during september of that year. clones i-iv were present in the hospital during  <dig> with multiple genotypes occurring in  <dig> of the  <dig> clinical service areas. the increased prevalence of esbl producing k. pneumoniae observed in the hospital during  <dig> involved strains belonging to clones i-iv. however all  <dig> clinical service areas were affected but no new genotypes were identified in that year. in contrast the subsequent decline in the frequency of isolates during  <dig> was accompanied by the emergence of new genotypes including clones v-viii which were identified in clinical specimens from  <dig> icu patients and the reemergence of clone i in the hospital after an absence of  <dig> months. during  <dig>  <dig> of  <dig> isolates from patients admitted to surgery and paediatrics belonged to clone vi.

as shown in table  <dig>  based on the antibiotic susceptibility testing  <dig> antibiotypes  were identified. there were  <dig>  quinolone-resistant isolates which were assigned antibiotypes r1-r <dig>  the isolates assigned antibiotype r <dig> were resistant to all the quinolones tested. the remaining  <dig> isolates were quinolone sensitive and were assigned antibiotypes r8-r <dig>  no correlations were found between the antibiotypes and genotypic clones of the mdr esbl producing k. pneumoniae. the strains which had similar antibiotypes often belonged to different pfge clones. however, all  <dig> isolates with quinolone-sensitive antibiotypes r <dig> and r <dig> belonged to pfge clone  <dig> as shown in table  <dig>

discussion
the clonal and temporal distributions of the mdr esbl producing k. pneumoniae strains among clinical service areas in the hospital do not suggest outbreaks of the organism at that institution during the period studied. instead the epidemiology of esbl producing k. pneumoniae at this hospital is more representative of an endemic persistence of clones of the organism with limited dissemination from patient to patient. however, the persistence of related clones over the time period suggests patient to patient transmission or healthcare worker to patient transmission. the emergence and reemergence of clone i in the icu during a 6-month period during  <dig> is consistent with this concept. also the results suggest that there has been transmission of some common strains including pfge clones i, ii and iii, over time in the hospital during 2000- <dig>  this might have been more evident if asymptomatic patients had been screened for mdr k. pneumoniae colonization. the presence of asymptomatically colonized patients may explain the intermittent appearances of certain strains over time in various hospital services. the epidemiology of esbl producing k. pneumoniae at this hospital proved complex and, as explained by branger et al  <cit> , may involve the spread of self-transferable plasmids as well as clonal spread  <cit> .

studies conducted in hospitals elsewhere have reported the spread of single clones of mdr k. pneumoniae among patients hospitalized over protracted periods of time  <cit> . in the present study esbl producing k. pneumoniae strains belonging to clone iii persisted in the hospital over the 5-year period studied. during  <dig> the year in which the largest number of cases, especially of paediatric cases, was seen different genotypes of the organism coexisted in patients on the same wards. this makes it less clear whether or not outbreaks caused by single different strains or involving the  <dig> endemic clones in the hospital had occurred. the prevalence of esbl producers at the university hospital of the west indies for that year was 18%  <cit> . the factors contributing to the increasing incidence of esbl producing k. pneumoniae during  <dig> have not been clearly defined at this hospital  <cit> . a number of risk factors for increased colonization with mdr k. pneumoniae including the use of third generation cephalosporins have been reviewed  <cit> .

other interesting observations from the study include the cases of long stay and repeat patients who remained colonized or had repeat infections with the same genotype after long periods of time and those with concomitant infections with different genotypes of esbl producing k. pneumoniae. branger et al  <cit>  reported the case of a patient colonized with the same esbl producing k. pneumoniae strain for  <dig> months  <cit> . sequential or simultaneous isolation of unrelated strains of esbl producing k. pneumoniae from individual patients has been reported by others  <cit> . weller et al  <cit>  reported that multiple subvariants of a strain could persist in an infective population without any one subvariant becoming dominant  <cit> .

the previously reported decreased susceptibility to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in esbl producing k. pneumoniae was also observed in this study  <cit> . the data on antibiotypes provided additional evidence in support of the clonality of the pfge genotypes. the predominant esbl producing k. pneumoniae genotypes i, ii, iii and iv had the quinolone-resistant antibiotype r <dig>  this might have contributed to the endemic persistence of these clones in the hospital  <cit> . the more susceptible clones were probably not endemic strains at the uhwi and may have been harboured by patients who were already colonized on admission  <cit> . notably, the pfge genotypes v, vii and viii isolated from icu patients also had the more resistant antibiotype r <dig> though found in lower numbers. a number of factors including aggressive antibiotic therapy, prolonged hospitalization and the performance of invasive procedures are well documented contributors to the increased risk of infection with nosocomial strains of mdr k. pneumoniae in patients admitted to the icu  <cit> .

clearly different antibiotic susceptibility patterns distinguish different strains of esbl producing k. pneumoniae as shown in the current study. however, antibiotic susceptibility testing has relatively limited utility as a typing system in epidemiologic studies not only because of phenotypic variation but also because antibiotic resistance is under extraordinary selective pressure in contemporary hospitals  <cit> . the selective pressure from antimicrobial therapy may alter the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of an organism, such that related organisms show different resistance profiles  <cit> . graffunder et al  <cit>  found a correlation between the selective pressure of antimicrobial agents identified as risk factors for esbl producing organisms and the presence of related resistance genes residing on the plasmids  <cit> . woodford et al  <cit>  also suggests that antibiotic pressure may have been a factor for initial colonization of patients and the development of further resistance by the organism  <cit> .

the limitations of the study are those attending studies involving retrospective data collection, the disproportionately small number of esbl producing k. pneumoniae strains from some clinical service areas, the long time period over which the isolates were collected, the lack of surveillance cultures to detect asymptomatic, colonized patients with mdr esbl producing k. pneumoniae and the limited available epidemiologic data to compare with the pfge typing results. during the extended period of study advances in medical technology, changes in patient population, formulary restrictions and changes in standards of practice or infection control measures may affect the results  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary the results showed clonal diversity of mdr esbl producing k. pneumoniae, elements of its temporal distribution which were suggestive of endemic persistence and dissemination of this organism between patients at this hospital, the extent of which was not fully ascertained. further studies which investigate the factors which determine the emergence and persistence of esbl producing k. pneumoniae in jamaican hospitals and the impact on clinical and economic outcomes at such institutions would be useful.
