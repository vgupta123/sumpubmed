BACKGROUND
abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, salt and aluminum  limit plant growth and development, causing reduction in crop yield and important economic losses for farmers. to tolerate these stresses, plants have evolved a broad spectrum of metabolic, physiological and developmentally adaptations. these adaptive changes are under the control of dynamic networks of genetic regulatory mechanisms that involve a large number of stress responsive genes. micrornas , a major class of small non-coding rnas, have emerged as key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level during plant growth and development  <cit> . several studies have shown that many mirna families are involved in response to different abiotic stresses in many species  <cit> . a large number of plant mirnas and their targets have been identified in the plant model arabidopsis thaliana and many other species. recent results have shown that plant mirna genes are dispersed throughout the genome  <cit>  within protein coding genes  <cit> , introns of protein coding and non-coding genes, and in intergenic regions  <cit> . moreover, mirnas may be produced from repetitive transposable elements  <cit> . to date, at the best of our knowledge,  <dig> wheat mirna candidates were identified by both bioinformatics and experimental approaches, using wheat expressed sequence tags  database, the available genomic sequences of the hexaploid wheat genome, its individual chromosome arms and its ancestors  <cit> . among the wheat mirna published sequences,  <dig> are registered in mirbase, a database of experimental mirnas  <cit> , and  <dig> are registered in pmrd, a database of plant mirnas identified using an in silico approach  <cit> . although the wheat genome is completely sequenced, it is not yet possible to perform a thorough genome-wide study in the hexaploid wheat t. aestivum since the genome is not completely assembled and annotated. this is caused by its large and complex genome containing a high percentage of dna repeats   <cit> . in silico approaches for the prediction of mirnas include screening genomic or est databases for orthologous sequences of known mirnas and analyzing their pre-mirna hairpin structures. although these approaches were successful in identifying conserved mirnas in plants that have their genomes fully sequenced and annotated  <cit> , they eliminate the potential of searching for low abundance mirnas that are often lineage-specific  <cit>  or condition-specific  <cit>  or that appeared recently in evolution . the challenge is bigger using polyploid species with partially sequenced and assembled genome such as the hexaploid wheat having a high content of repetitive dna. to tackle this issue, one should develop conservation-independent techniques based on structure analyses and/or expression pattern of dicer cleavage products among pre-mirnas  <cit> .

most computational approaches labeled as mirna predictors are actually pre-mirna predictors, in the sense that they identify candidate genomic regions that may form pre-mirnas but rarely take into account the availability of candidate mature mirna evidence within the pre-mirna. several tools such as mirdeep  <cit> , miranalyzer  <cit>  and mirdup  <cit>  were developed to predict mirnas from raw reads data and shown to be accurate in most cases. furthermore, many factors that affect mirna expression including genotypes, tissues, age, development stage, growth condition , stress treatment, are rarely considered in previous wheat mirna identification studies. all wheat reported mirnas were identified in libraries produced from seedlings or plants grown under normal conditions  <cit> , or tissue exposed to heat  <cit>  or seedling  <cit>  and pollen mother cells from plants  <cit>  exposed to cold stress  <cit> , or drought  <cit> . they were identified from different genotypes of winter or spring wheat in soil, or hydroponic solution and under different photoperiod conditions, or in field conditions. since mirna expression is tissue specific and regulated in response to plant development and growth conditions, the mirna repertoire of hexaploid wheat is still incomplete. although a large number of mirnas associated with development or some abiotic stresses in wheat were previously identified, their functional diversity in al, freezing tolerance, and floral transition in winter wheat is still unknown. hence, the identification of mirnas associated with tolerance to abiotic stress and floral transition is a first step towards the elucidation of their role in wheat.

to ensure an accurate identification of a large fraction of mirnas associated with different physiological conditions in both stress sensitive and tolerant wheat, we conducted the present study to: 1) identify mirnas from different tissues of plants from different genotypes grown under different stress conditions  and at different development stages ; 2) develop an integrative pipeline that combines bioinformatic tools, biological insights about known mirna expression and dicer ligation patterns according to the universal plant mirna criteria  <cit> , mirna expression profiles in deep sequencing data  <cit> , functional classification and experimental approaches . the bioinformatic tools include mipred  <cit> , hhmmir  <cit> , mircheck  <cit>  and mirdup*, a plant updated version of our machine learning mirdup  <cit>  which validates the position of sequenced mirnas in its corresponding folded pre-mirna. our integrative approach allows the discovery and profile of  <dig> novel hexaploid wheat abiotic stress responsive candidate mirnas including ones associated with cold  and al  tolerance as well as  <dig> developmentally responsive mirnas with a high confidence level. it is the first study to report a large scale identification of hexaploid mirnome mirnas from different tissues of sensitive and tolerant genotypes under normal conditions and short/long exposure to different abiotic stresses during vegetative and/or reproductive phase.figure  <dig> overview of the wheat mirna pipeline. the procedure is divided in three parts: producing and sequencing small rna libraries, the bioinformatic prediction of mirnas and functional analysis of the predicted mirnas. the customized or developed steps are marked by stars. orange boxes specify the data at hand after each given step. for details see experimental procedure.



RESULTS
identification of mirna candidates and their targets in hexaploid wheat
our mirna discovery pipeline consists of more than twenty steps divided in three main parts: producing and sequencing small rnas, predicting mirnas from deep sequencing data, classifying predicted mirnas based on their expression profiles and gene ontology  of their target genes . the sequencing of ten constructed libraries from three wheat genotypes grown under different abiotic stress conditions and development stages  yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> redundant raw reads  with 56% of high sequence quality . before mapping the raw reads, we collected  <dig>  million wheat ests from several databases, clustered into  <dig>  uniref clusters yielding to the best of our knowledge, the largest well-annotated est databank in wheat . after raw reads adapter removal, a total of  <dig>  million unique raw reads were mapped to our collected est database resulting of  <dig>  million unique mapped sequences . we identified  <dig>  small rnas and extracted  <dig>  potential pre-mirnas. among the extracted pre-mirna,  <dig>  and  <dig>  potential hairpins satisfy the minimal structural criteria of mirnas assessed by two well-known pre-mirna predictors, mipred  <cit>  and hhmmir  <cit> , respectively . the lack of consideration of the mature mirna localization in the hairpin, the expression profiles of reads throughout the hairpin, and/or other evidence of plant-mirna characteristics represent major causes of overestimation of the number of candidate hairpins. we used a two-step method of mirna identification within its hairpin from the folded pre-mirna using mirdup* and expression profile filtering using meyers et al. relaxed criteria  <cit>  . in the first step, mirdup* trained on experimentally validated mirnas from different datasets  localizes mirna positions in pre-mirnas . the use of mirdup* reduced the number of pre-mirna hairpin candidates by 81% . in the second step, the expression profile filtering was based on mirna expression pattern using the abundance of the mirna candidates in each library and the distribution of reads mapped to a candidate pre-mirna according to meyers et al. relaxed criteria  <cit> . this allowed the elimination of the mirna dicer-like candidates and the reduction of mirna candidates by 84%.

overall, this method results in the identification of more candidates  compared to meyers et al.,  <cit>  and mircheck  <cit> . consequently, it yields pre-mirna candidates that have various ranges of secondary structures as shown in dotbracket notation . taken together, our approach identifies  <dig> unique mirna candidates associated with  <dig> pre-mirnas . it is important to notice that the majority of reads  and the predicted mirnas  have the highest quality value for their sequence . it is important to note that, mirdup* captures 95% of the mirnas identified using mircheck with the same criteria from meyers et al.  <cit>  while  <dig> putative candidates  are excluded by mircheck . in addition, our pipeline identified mirnas that have features that are species specific, clade specific or shared between several species. we found that among the  <dig> identified mirnas,  <dig> were identified by mirdup* trained on all species of mirbase; only  <dig> were commonly identified by mirdup* trained on the three datasets . this suggests that these mirnas share common features with all the widely separated plant lineages recorded in the database mirbase. for instance, apmir_ <dig> corresponding to mir <dig> with perfect match in wheat and moss physcomitrella patens  is highly expressed in our investigated conditions indicating that this mirna may play common biological functions in plants kingdom. while  <dig> mirnas were only identified by mirdup* trained on all plant and  <dig> mirnas when trained on only monocot.

the number of identified mirnas may be an overestimation due to the redundancy created by similar but not identical ests in part due to the polyploid nature of wheat. in the latter scenario, two or more closely related ests  could encode identical or closely related mirnas. furthermore expressed isomirnas that share the same properties with the real mirna in one library could be the dominant functional in another library. the additional file 3: figure s3a highlights that the majority  of the predicted mirnas are associated with one pre-mirna. furthermore, most of the pre-mirna candidates  harbour a unique mirna leading to an exclusive mirna/pre-mirna association . to characterize further the nature of the pre-mirna candidates, we determined if they were associated with repetitive transposable elements and protein coding regions. the results revealed that 20% of pre-mirnas that correspond to  <dig> % of mirna candidates overlap with transposable elements  from trep database . in addition, 15% of ests corresponding to less than 5% of mirna candidates overlap partly with protein-coding regions  from protein plant database .

prediction of mirna targets is an important step to elucidate mirna function in regulating gene expression. among the identified candidates, 67%  were predicted to have uniref annotated target genes . unlike animal target genes, it is generally accepted that plant targets adopt a perfect seed match with the corresponding mirnas, allowing more accuracy in their prediction. we found that  <dig> mirna candidates are predicted to target a unique gene identified as uniref . although the majority of mirna candidates seem to have more than two targets, detailed analysis reveals that in many cases the targets annotated with different unirefs have the same gene description . to better explore the functional properties of the target genes, go analyses were performed .

we computed the enrichment of main go slim terms found within these targets based on the three go categories . table  <dig> shows the enriched go slim terms and relevant associated target genes in libraries. an extensive description of go enrichment analysis is presented in additional file  <dig>  our results revealed that mirna candidates target regulators, cell metabolism and transport genes. the regulatory genes are enriched for many transcription factors and protein families . they are involved in regulation of gene expression, signal transduction pathways and ubiquitin-mediated protein modifications . cellular metabolism genes are involved in hormone, lipid and carbohydrates metabolism , amino acid metabolism  .table  <dig>

characteristics of the mirna candidates
among the  <dig> predicted mirnas,  <dig> have sequence homology with  <dig> published mirna in wheat . in addition, we explored the potential of conserved mirbase families present in our raw data that could not be mapped into the est and found  <dig> mirnas, corresponding to  <dig> families from which  <dig> families are known in wheat  <cit>  and  <dig> families have homology with many plant species . it is important to notice that  <dig> families  have not yet been reported in previous wheat mirna identification studies recorded in mirbase . one can notice that the expression patterns of predicted mirnas are different between the  <dig> libraries . the abundance of  <dig> mirnas corresponds at medium expression  in at least one library and  <dig> mirnas have high reads abundance. mirnas were also classified according to their expression proportion over the total reads mapping to the corresponding pre-mirnas  <cit> . hence, one class would correspond to typical mirna when its expression represents more than 50% of the expressed small rnas mapping a given pre-mirna   <cit> . above 80% of the predicted mirnas in each library correspond to typical mirnas  and they correspond to highly confident expressed mirnas .figure  <dig> overview of the predicted mirnas. a) diagram of the intersection between mirnas predicted by the novel approach, conserved mirnas identified by sequence homology, and mirnas published in the literature; b) evidence of conserved plant mirna families present in mirbase including those predicted by our approach ; c) the abundance bins of all predicted mirnas in the  <dig> libraries  produced from plants grown under different investigated conditions. the abundance of the identified mirnas represents the number of reads sequenced in each library and classified on  <dig> levels: low, 10– <dig> reads; medium, 100– <dig> reads; and high,  <dig> and up; d) the length distribution of mirnas associated with mirnas differentially expressed in different investigated comparisons; e) the number of mirna targeted genes  associated with mirnas differentially expressed in different investigated comparisons. wcvcl, winter wheat cultivar clair ; scvbo, spring wheat cultivar bounty ; wcvat, winter wheat cultivar atlas ; a.p, aerial parts; l./rep. t., leaves and reproductive tissues; n.c, normal conditions; al, aluminum; vern., vernalization; rep., reproductive; str. resp., stress response; tol., tolerance; dev. resp., developmentally response; fl. trans, floral transition; flw., flowering. see additional file 1: method s <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig> for libraries and conditions and additional file 2: table s <dig> for the different investigated comparisons.



the diversity of predicted mirna sequences is greater at 19 nt in length in all libraries  while the diversity of conserved mirnas is greater at 21 nt  . for redundant mirna sequences, a major peak at 21 nt was observed for both predicted and conserved mirnas . in addition, the majority of the identified mirna expressed in the different investigated conditions are  <dig> or 21 nt long depending on the tissues, stresses, growth conditions or genotypes . these mirnas were shown to regulate at least  <dig> targets  and at most  <dig> targets  in all the explored conditions .

confirmation of predicted mirna candidates
selected mirna candidates were validated by northern blotting, a useful criterion for authenticating mirnas  <cit> . for this selection, mirnas were ranked according to their expression level. then, candidates were randomly chosen from either the predicted only by mirdup*  or predicted by both mirdup* and mircheck  as well as low, medium and high expression. their characteristics and their secondary structures are presented in figure 3a and table  <dig>  these structures reveal the less stringent rules in mirdup* concerning the symmetric and/or asymmetric bulges in which the number of successive unpaired bases could range up to five nt in the duplex such as in apmir_ <dig> . their expression was confirmed under all the investigated conditions . many probes detect more than one mature mirna product with distinct lengths in different libraries, 19/21 nt for apmir_ <dig>  21/23 nt for apmir_ <dig>  and apmir_ <dig> . this indicates that the second detected mirna product may be a variant of each of these mirna candidates. at least two of these mirnas exhibit complex expression patterns in response to cold, vernalization, salt, al, and in development . for instance, the larger mirna product detected for apmir_ <dig> is preferentially expressed in the al-treated library from spring wheat . in addition, in some libraries the expression level of the apmir_ <dig> and apmir_ <dig> is much higher than what may be expected from the low read numbers obtained from deep sequencing . this may be due to the presence of very closely related mirna variants that can hybridize with the probes especially if the mismatches are at their start/end. probes used would not be able to differentiate between these possibilities and thus would represent an average response of these related mirnas. the mirna size may affect an ago <dig> functional state that mediates the recruitment of rdr <dig>  <cit> . however, for the apmir_ <dig> whose precursors overlap with transposable elements , the high expression level and the presence of more than one size detected by northern may be associated with their repetitive nature with sequence variation in the genome.figure  <dig> experimental validation of predicted and conserved wheat mirnas. a) pre-mirna secondary structure of mirna candidates experimentally validated by northern in the investigated libraries; b) northern blot of predicted mirnas in common between mirdup* and mircheck  as well as specifically predicted with mirdup* tool ; c) northern blot of mirna candidates identified by both sequence homology against mirbase  and predicted in common between mircheck and mirdup*. ethidium bromide staining of the rrnas is shown as gel loading control. l <dig> represents the control library for al treatment  in spring wheat bounty which was not sequenced. the numbers between the parentheses correspond to the expression rank among the  <dig> predicted mirnas. the lower value corresponds to the higher read abundance. for more information about the libraries and conditions see additional file 1: method s <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig>

expression of the identified mirnas in response to different abiotic stresses and plant development in wheat
to identify mirnas associated with short and long exposure to cold, salt and al responses and tolerance, three different control and five treated libraries from sensitive and tolerant wheat genotypes were used. to identify mirnas associated with floral transition and flowering in winter wheat, one library from plants at vegetative phase under normal growth conditions, one library under vernalization conditions  and one library from de-acclimated  plants at the reproductive phase were used. analysis of mirna expression levels identified 91%  of mirnas that are differentially expressed between the stress conditions compared to the control by more than twofold change with a fdr of  <dig>  . out of the  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> mirnas are responsive to different abiotic stresses  and  <dig> mirnas are associated with plant development, particularly floral transition and flowering . among abiotic stress responsive ones,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas are associated with cold and al tolerance, respectively . we also find that regulated mirnas may exhibit either common or specific expression patterns. many of them show expression that is tissue, stress, genotype, or development stage-specific . they may be specific to al in roots, cold/vernalization and salt treatment in aerial parts, or common to two stresses or to all of the investigated abiotic stresses . this indicates a crosstalk between the regulatory mechanisms of cold, al and salt responses. this observation is confirmed by northern blot analysis showing a dynamic and complex expression pattern for several abiotic stress responsive mirnas . for instance, the candidates apmir_ <dig> and apmir_ <dig> are slightly up-regulated by cold, but also strongly down-regulated by salt and al. the regulated mirnas may be also specific to vegetative , reproductive phase ; or common to the two phases . moreover, out of the  <dig> mirna candidates, less than 10% are ubiquitously expressed under the investigated conditions.figure  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in response to cold, salt, aluminum and development. a) the differential expression of mirnas in response to vernalization ). the lines specify the thresholds used to identify the most relevant differentially expressed mirnas. the blue and red dots correspond respectively to expressed small rnas and predicted mirnas; b) the frequencies of differentially expressed mirnas in response to vernalization, cold, al, salt and development stage ; and those differentially expressed between tolerant and sensitive genotypes; c) venn diagram of mirnas regulated under short/long exposure to cold  in leaves, al  in roots and salt  in leaves; d) venn diagram of mirnas expressed in control plants during vegetative phase under normal conditions , plants acclimated up to  <dig> days at 4°c  during vegetative phase and, plants acclimated up to  <dig> days at 4°c and then transferred to normal conditions under long day photoperiod to induce flowering during the reproductive phase . up, up-regulated mirnas; dw, down-regulated mirnas; cold/vrn, cold and vernalization responsive mirnas in spring  and winter wheat , respectively; salt responsive mirnas in winter wheat ; al responsive mirnas in spring  and winter  wheat; for tolerance, only differentially expressed mirnas between cold  and al  treated libraries are presented. all other abbreviations’ are described in the legend of figure  <dig>  see additional file 1: method s <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig> about libraries and conditions and additional file 2: table s <dig> for more information about regulated mirnas.



functional classification of abiotic stress and developmentally regulated mirnas in wheat
the potential functions of regulated mirnas  were classified into  <dig> mirna groups for cold , al  and development  according to their expression in two wheat genotypes that differ in their degree of tolerance as well as during different development stages . for each stress, we found that groups  <dig> and  <dig>  having similar expression profiles in tolerant and sensitive genotypes are associated with cold/al responses while other groups  showing different expression patterns between the two genotypes are associated with tolerance . for development mirna groups,  <dig> groups are associated with floral transition  and flowering . the  <dig> mirna groups were subjected to go enrichment analysis based on the  <dig> categories: cell component, molecular function and biological process . several highly enriched go slim terms associated with the studied conditions .figure  <dig> go slim enrichment for differentially expressed mirnas in response to abiotic stress and development. differentially expressed mirnas with the same or different expression patterns between plants from tolerant and sensitive genotypes under normal and abiotic stress conditions; and between plants at vegetative and reproductive phases were classified into  <dig> mirna groups. mirna targets are annotated to the best scoring go slim terms in biological process category. the lines are grouped according to their association to cold and vernalization , aluminum  and development . see additional file 2: table s <dig> for more information about mirna groups. the value in each case indicates the number of associations mirna-target- go for the corresponding go slim. the enrichment is presented in four different colors , “orange square symbol” medium enrichment , “light orange square symbol” low enrichment  and “white square symbol” no enrichment .



the mirna group associated with cold responses  is specifically enriched for membrane  in the category cell component  and signal transduction  in the category biological process . consistently, enrichment is also found for nucleus , protein binding activity , nucleobase containing component metabolic process and response to endogenous stimulus  which are all overrepresented by auxin responsive proteins. these results indicate that cold regulated mirnas may function in carbon partitioning during photosynthesis and in auxin-activated signaling pathways. for mirna groups associated with al responses , an enrichment is found for hydrolase activity , catalytic activity  , response to endogenous stimulus , dna metabolic process  . these results indicate that al-regulated mirnas may function in regulation of gene expression and signaling as well as plant defense under oxidative stress. more interestingly, many targets found for mirna groups associated with cold  and al  tolerance are known for their function in stress adaptation. for mirna groups associated with cold tolerance, the groups co <dig> and co <dig>  showed enrichment for the go slim term response to stress . in addition, co <dig> is enriched for response to abiotic stimulus   and the group co <dig> is enriched for cell wall , nucleus , hydrolase activity  and catalytic activity  . this indicates that the identified cold regulated mirnas may function in proteolysis, gibberellins biosynthesis and glucose metabolism. the group co <dig> is enriched for transporter activity   while the group co <dig> is enriched for pollen-pistil interaction   indicating that they may also have a function in ion transport and signaling.

moreover, for groups associated with al tolerance, the most enriched go slim terms are mitochondrion, transporter activity  and carbohydrates metabolic process  indicating that mirnas from these groups may mediate glycolysis and respiration process under al stress conditions. enrichment is also found for the terms catalytic activity, hydrolase activity, sequence specific transcription factor activity , secondary metabolic process, embryo development, anatomical structural morphogenesis and multi-organismal development . they are overrepresented by many important metabolism enzymes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism and ubiquitination process  as well as transcription factors .

interestingly, the targets in mirna groups associated with development are involved in cell growth and flowering. the mirna groups associated with flowering  show enrichment for the go slim terms protein binding activity, sequence specific dna transcription binding activity , and/or kinase activity  . they are also enriched for nucleobase containing compound metabolism and pollen pistil interaction that are specifically represented by two well characterized regulators genes  . one mirna group associated with floral transition  is enriched for the go slim terms transport and response to endogenous stimulus, specifically represented by auxin-responsive proteins. furthermore, the potential function of ubiquitously expressed mirna libraries was also investigated. they show significant enrichment for the go slim terms thylakoid , kinase activity, nucleotide binding activity , and cell protein modifications . this result indicates that constitutively expressed mirnas may modulate the basic cellular functions reflecting their vital regulatory role in other growth conditions yet to be identified in wheat.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the wheat mirna pipeline
in this study, we developed a pipeline that identifies conserved as well as clade and species-specific or young mirnas. this pipeline can be easily adapted for other plant species. to predict mirnas from ngs and analyze their function, the steps described in figure  <dig> are required. while several steps are standard in ngs analyses  <cit> , we improved the mirna prediction steps by integrating folded pre-mirna candidates, expression profiling and functional analyses of differentially expressed candidates. to address the step of mirna prediction, we decided to exploit two methods with different algorithmic schemes mipred  <cit>  and hhmmir  <cit>  to have a broad range of hairpin candidates. these methods were trained on pre-mirnas from plants and wheat sequences available in mirbase and resulted in the identification of a large number of pre-mirna candidates using the predictors mipred  <cit>  and hhmmir  <cit> . to address issues of latter methods for the lack of consideration of mature mirna and their surrounding biological features, we developed a classifier that ranked the best  <dig> biological features of plant mirnas that was integrated into mirdup* . for robustness, the classifier’s models were trained separately on three datasets . this increases species-specificity and allows the discovery of features that distinguish wheat mirnas from those of other species. the developed classifier  was able to reduce the level of false prediction obtained by mipred  <cit>  and hhmmir  <cit>  by more than 81%  and allowed the assessment of the position of a mirna in a given pre-mirna sequence. in addition, the combinatorial analysis between mirdup* and mircheck  <cit>  which identifies 20-nt regions of a given plant pre-mirna using a predetermined set of rules and constraints, show that mircheck is too stringent and easily removed experimentally validated mirnas .

the availability of wheat est databases and our approach enabled us to identify with confidence  <dig> mirna candidates. these candidates may include mirna gene homeologs from the three genomes of hexaploid wheat, or ests with snp differences in different wheat varieties. it is also reasonable to assume that these families represent only a fraction of the total mirnas that may exists in hexaploid wheat since many small rnas still remain unmapped to wheat sequences or conserved mirnas from mirbase. the availability of the complete assembled and well-annotated hexaploid wheat genome will help to complete the discovery of the remaining mirnas.

it is important to emphasize that among the predicted mirnas, in spite of being derived from ests, less than 5% of the mature mirnas are associated with known protein coding regions and less than 7% are related to transposable elements . according to dinger et al.,  <cit> , many transcripts are categorized as bifunctional rnas. they can be translated into protein but also function independently as rna. the presence of such bifunctional rnas challenges the assumption that the rna world can be neatly parsed between mutually exclusive protein-coding and non-coding categories.

mirna candidates associated with abiotic stress responses
this study represents one of the largest de novo mirnaome analyses in response to different abiotic stresses and development in hexaploid wheat. although many cold responsive mirnas have been identified in spring wheat using ngs  <cit> , our study identified a large number of novel candidates regulated by cold, vernalization, al and salt with dynamic and complex expression patterns . several identified mirnas are either associated with a specific stress or common to at least two stresses . many of their targets are known to be stress-related genes  commonly regulated under abiotic stresses.

our results show that mirnas may mediate plant responses to al treatment by regulating expression of stress related genes particularly those involved in auxin signaling and fatty acid metabolism. this is consistent with the fact that al affects the relative abundance of membrane lipids and the degree of fatty acid unsaturation  <cit>  and auxin response factors  that are known to inhibit root development in response to al toxicity  <cit> . in addition, the experimentally validated apmir_ <dig>  is regulated by al exposure  and targets specifically arfs. many arf members are known to be regulated by mir <dig> and mir <dig> and to play regulatory roles in adventitious rooting  <cit> , supporting the possible role of apmir_ <dig> in root development under al treatment.

mirna candidates associated with cold responses and freezing tolerance
our data indicate that cold regulates the expression of several mirnas in spring as well as in winter wheat . four mirna groups associated with cold tolerance  target a set of cold regulated genes known to be involved in freezing tolerance including the transcription factors cbfs, dehydrins, dead-box rna helicases, thaumatin-like protein  <cit> . interestingly, many candidate mirna target genes related to the ice1–cbf major pathway that regulates freezing tolerance in cold hardy plants. this includes the targets dead-box atp-dependent rna helicase  <dig>  cbf and dehydrin . results from our previous studies demonstrated that genes related to the ice1–cbf pathway play a critical role in freezing tolerance in hexaploid wheat  <cit> . here we show that the mirna candidate apmir_ <dig> is regulated in response to cold , and target the cold responsive genes dehydrins   <cit> . the candidate apmir_ <dig> from mirna group associated with cold tolerance target cbfivb-b <dig> gene . these results suggest that these mirnas may contribute to freezing tolerance by regulating cold-regulated genes belonging to the cbf regulon in winter wheat.

predicted mirna target genes common in regulating several stresses
plants evolved common regulatory mechanisms to adapt to environmental stresses such as oxidative stress commonly induced by both cold and al. our results show that many of the identified abiotic stress responsive mirnas exhibited a common stress expression pattern . for instance, the expression of the new member of mir <dig> family, mir395- <dig> corresponding to apmir_ <dig>  is commonly regulated in response to cold and al stress  indicating that mir <dig> is not specific to sulfate starvation as previously reported in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . zhao et al.,  <cit>  also reported that mir <dig> is involved in phosphate homeostasis in wheat. this indicates that mir <dig> mediates not only plant response to sulfate deficiency but also may mediate responses to other nutrients that are imbalanced under abiotic stress conditions. taken together, our results indicate that mir <dig> would play a common role in plant nutrient homeostasis under abiotic stress conditions. in agreement with previous suggestions, our results indicate that mirnas coordinate crosstalk among different nutrient deficiencies. this is the first indication that crosstalk between cold, al stress and plant nutrients could be regulated by mirnas. moreover, we show that the mirna candidate apmir_ <dig> is also commonly regulated under cold, salt and al  and targets glutathione peroxidase . recent findings showed that human mirnas regulate glutathione peroxidase expression to maintain redox homeostasis  <cit> . this supports the possible role of apmir_ <dig> in mediating crosstalk between abiotic stress responses by regulating glutathione metabolism.

in this study, we investigate the role of mirnas during the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase, and during flowering in winter wheat that requires vernalization to flower. we found that among developmentally responsive mirnas, many candidates target cold responsive genes known for their function in flowering transition and flower development . for instance, the candidate apmir_ <dig> corresponding to hvu-mir444b  could target many mikc-type mads-box transcription factors, the homologs of taagl <dig> and osmads <dig>  in wheat, mikc-type mads-box transcription factors control flower development and morphogenesis  <cit> . in barley, this target contains both the target site for mir444b and the precursor sequence for mir444a  <cit> ). in rice, osmads <dig> is involved in axillary bud development and regulation of tillering through down-regulation of mir444a  <cit> . since the mirna variants from mir <dig> family are functional, and mads-box genes are collectively regulated by the mir <dig> family  <cit> , we suggest that apmir_ <dig> may mediate flowering through the regulation of mikc-type mads-box transcription factor gene expression. apmir_ <dig> target genes encoding ubiquitin-like-specific protease esd <dig> known to regulate plant responses to cold and the time of flower initiation  <cit> . in addition, apmir_ <dig> corresponding to mir <dig>  are involved in promotion of floral transition in many species. in ornamental plants, mir159-regulated gamyb expression is an effective pathway of flowering time control  <cit> . this suggests that apmir_ <dig> and apmir_ <dig> may mediate flowering time in wheat through the regulation of ubiquitin-like-specific protease esd <dig> and gamyb gene expression.
