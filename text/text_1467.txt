BACKGROUND
immunological tolerance is a key feature of the immune system that allows the organism to discriminate self from nonself, providing defense against foreign pathogens while preventing autoimmunity. this ability of the immune system is controlled by mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance. central tolerance involves deletion of self-reactive t cells in the thymus at an early stage of development  <cit> . however, this mechanism alone is not sufficient for preventing autoimmunity, as autoreactive t cells are also detected in healthy individuals  <cit> . a second mechanism involves the thymic selection of a population of regulatory t cells , which dominantly prevents both the activation and the effector function of autoreactive t cells that have eluded other mechanisms of tolerance  <cit> . the depletion or inactivation of treg leads to the development of a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory manifestations such as gastritis, oophoritis, orchitis, thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease and spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, in animal models  <cit> . in addition, reduced numbers of this cellular subset have been found in murine models of sle  <cit> .

t cells expressing the high affinity t cell receptor  for antigens expressed on the thymic epithelium  <cit>  are selected in the thymus, originating treg cells able to suppress both proliferation and cytokine production by effector cells in a cell-contact dependent manner. the mechanisms involved in treg generation, maintenance or function have not been fully clarified. for instance, while ctla-4-/- mice develop an early lymphoproliferative disease  <cit>  and ctla <dig> gene expression in the thymus appears instrumental for t cell selection  <cit> , some regulatory t cells can be generated in the absence of ctla- <dig>  <cit> . given its wide ranged immuno-suppressor activity, tgf-β was first thought to be a mediator of treg activity  <cit> , but is nowadays known to play a major role in treg homeostasis by promoting their proliferation  <cit> .

in humans, treg are highly enriched in the cellular subset expressing cd <dig>  the α chain of the il- <dig> receptor  and the memory marker cd45ro  <cit> . low numbers or functional defects in cd4+cd25+ t cells have been found in patients with sle  <cit> , immune-mediated diabetes  <cit> , and multiple sclerosis  <cit> . natural cd4+cd25+ treg express the transcription factor foxp <dig>  which controls their development and function  <cit> . functional defects in the foxp <dig> gene lead to the absence of treg production and to immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy, x-linked syndrome   <cit> . the control of immune cell numbers and effector functions in response to lymphopenia, infection and autoimmune reactivity are also under the strict control of treg  <cit> .

sle is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with unknown etiology, and thought to result from the interplay between genetic and environmental factors  <cit> . multiple immune system defects have been described in patients with this condition, including b cell hyperactivity and increased antinuclear autoantibody production, defects in t cell activation and aberrant cytokine production  <cit> . to establish the involvement of treg in sle pathogenesis, we compared the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells in sle patients and controls and correlated it with disease activity and antinuclear autoantibody production. we also analyzed the frequency of cd4+foxp3+ cells in a subset of patients and investigated treg frequency variation with disease activity, severity and development and remission of symptoms in two sle cases. further, we analyzed the segregation of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ frequency in sle-affected families and tested the candidate genes ctla <dig>  tgfβ, foxp <dig>  il <dig> and cd <dig> for association with treg frequency distribution and with sle.

methods
population sample
sle patients and their relatives were recruited in several hospitals throughout portugal in collaboration with the portuguese lupus association. a total of  <dig> sle patients  were enrolled in the present study.  <dig> of the sle patients were part of  <dig> families, from which  <dig> relatives  were also included in the study. all patients met the revised  <dig> american college of rheumatology criteria for sle  <cit> , independently of their disease activity at recruitment. the sle disease activity index   <cit>  was assessed for each patient at the time of collection . irreversible damage caused by the disease was calculated using the systemic lupus erythematosus international collaborating clinics  damage index. information on medication from each patient was collected at recruitment. patients and their relatives completed a  <dig> question screening questionnaire  <cit> , used here as an indication of autoimmune disease manifestations in each individual . control individuals  were blood donors recruited from several regional blood centers. the population sample characteristics and the numbers used in each of the subsequent analyses are described in additional file  <dig>  approval for this study was obtained from the portuguese ethics committee for life sciences research, and collection of all biological samples was performed after written informed consent from all participating individuals.

cell surface staining and flow cytometry
pbmc were isolated using vacutainer cpt™ tubes . for the cd4cd25cd45ro staining  <dig> ×  <dig> cells were fixed in 2% pfa, washed twice in pbs 2% fcs and subsequently incubated for  <dig> min at 4°c with the optimal dilution of each conjugated anti-human mab . cells were washed again and fluorescence intensity staining was analyzed using a facscan flow cytometer . cd4+cd25+ t cells were defined, for all the individuals, as the population of cd <dig> positive t cells whose cd <dig> expression exceeded the level of cd <dig> positivity seen in the cd <dig> negative t cells. the cd4-fitc, cd25-apc, foxp3-pe staining was performed according to ebioscience manufacture protocol.

anti-dsdna autoantibody measurement by quantitative elisa
reacti-bind™ eia plates  were coated overnight at 4°c with  <dig> mg/ml purified dsdna . the plates were blocked with a solution of 1% gelatin for  <dig> h at 4°c and incubated overnight at 4°c with test plasma  at a total protein concentration was  <dig>  mg/ml. plates were then incubated overnight at 4°c with  <dig> μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-human igg  and bound igg was revealed using  <dig> mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate . absorbance at  <dig> nm was measured in an elisa plate reader . quantification of each reactivity was obtained by fitting ods to a standard curve present in duplicates on each plate, and consisting of  <dig> serial dilutions of respective positive control sera. in the readout, one unit was defined as the equivalent of the highest concentration used for the respective positive control serum, which was previously chosen to be below the saturation level. fractions of one unit were consequently defined by the dilution factor of this standard, at which it yielded an od equivalent to that obtained for a respective sample  <cit> .

genotyping
genomic dna was isolated from pbmc by standard methods. the polymorphic markers tested were selected for their putative role in gene expression or function. within the ctla <dig> gene, we genotyped a functional snp involving a missense a>g transition at + <dig> exon  <dig>  and a 3'utr microsatelite marker proposed to influence mrna stability and turnover  <cit> . in the tgfβ gene, we genotyped a c>t transition in the promoter  and a g>c snp in exon  <dig> , both known to be associated with the serum concentration of tgf-β  <cit> . within the foxp <dig> gene two microsatelite markers were genotyped  and a - <dig> g>a snp   <cit> . the il <dig> gene, - <dig> g<t  and + <dig> g>t  in the promoter and in exon  <dig>  respectively, were genotyped as previously described  <cit> . within the cd <dig> gene, we genotyped a n repeat  <dig> kb upstream of the gene  and two snps, rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  as previously described  <cit> . the d10s <dig> microsatelite marker was genotyped using the applied biosystems fluorescence based automated sequencer. semi-automated fragment sizing was performed using genescan®  <dig> .

mrna isolation and quantification
total rna was isolated from  <dig> ×  <dig> pbmc using the rneasy mini kit . the first strand cdna was generated by reverse transcription with oligo dt primer . the ctla- <dig>  tgf-β, foxp <dig>  il- <dig> and cd <dig> mrna levels were quantified with the lightcycler  in  <dig> patients and  <dig> controls, which were representative of the total population sample.  <dig> ng of first-stranded cdna were amplified and real-time fluorimetric intensity of sybr green i was monitored. rt-pcr reactions consisted in an initial denaturation step at 95°c for  <dig> minutes followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> seconds, 56°c for  <dig> seconds and 72°c for  <dig> seconds. the individual samples were standardized by the amount of hprt rna. this rt-pcr reaction consisted on an initial denaturation step at 95°c for  <dig> minutes followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> seconds, 60°c for  <dig> seconds and 72°c for  <dig> seconds. additionally, ctla- <dig> and cd <dig> mrna expression levels were normalized by the proportion of cd4+ cells, given that these molecules are mainly expressed by cd4+ t cells.

statistical analysis
nonparametric analysis of variance was performed using the mann-whitney u and kruskal-wallis tests to compare the distributions of t cell frequencies in patients and controls. results were considered significant at the  <dig>  level. heritability estimation was performed by the solar software  <cit> . in this test the likelihood of the sporadic model of no inheritance is compared with the likelihood of a polygenic model of inheritance. the sporadic model constitutes our null hypothesis in which it is assumed that there is not a genetic component underlying the frequencies of treg cells. the polygenic model constitutes our testing hypothesis, where the quantitative trait is considered to be determined by a large number of genetic loci acting independently and/or additively. the models are then compared to find the hypothesis that is better supported by the data. hardy-weinberg equilibrium  was analyzed by the hwe exact test. linkage disequilibrium  between two polymorphic markers was quantified as d' using the haploxt program implemented in the gold software  <cit> .

RESULTS
lower frequency of cd4+cd25+ and cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ cells in sle patients
the previous observation that a cd4+cd25+ t cell subpopulation expressing the cd45ro activation marker exhibits 75% higher suppressive activity  <cit>  suggests that the majority of treg activity is restricted to cd45ro+ cells. we therefore evaluated the frequency of both cd4+cd25+ and cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell populations in total lymphocyte pmbc samples of sle patients, their relatives and healthy controls and expressed it as a percentage of total cd4+ cells . cd4+cd25+ and cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequencies were significantly decreased in patients compared to controls . cd4+cd25+ and cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell distribution in relatives was intermediate between that of patients and controls . as the frequency distributions of either cell population were identical, the results obtained for the cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ cell subset was considered for the remaining of this study.

sle affects primarily women and consequently only about 10% of our patients are male, while our control population is balanced in terms of gender. we therefore tested whether this gender bias was not a confounding factor in our interpretation. cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency was significantly lower in healthy females than in males . the cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency was also lower in females than in males in the patient and relative groups, although the difference did not reach statistical significance . separate analysis within each gender group shows that the cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency is always significantly lower in patients .

cd <dig> is a marker for both treg and activated cells. to rule out the possibility that this t cell population is mainly constituted by activated cells we measured the frequency of the cd4+cd45ro+ t cells, since cd45ro expression is associated with early activation events. no difference was found in the frequency of cd4+cd45ro+ cells between patients and controls , indicating that the cd25+ population was largely a regulatory population.

to exclude a global thymic output defect, we evaluated the percentage of recent thymic emigrants  inside the cd4+ population using the phenotypic markers cd45ro-cd31+  <cit> . as expected, cd45ro-cd31+ cell frequency decreased with age, but there were no differences between patients and controls in absolute frequency or in the kinetics of decay . moreover, the frequency of rte did not correlate with the percentages of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ cells . however, the cd31+ cells inside cd4+cd25+ cells decreased faster with age in patients than in controls , suggesting a defect specifically in thymic treg cell production in sle patients. no significant difference was found in the frequency of cd4+cd45ro-cd31+ or cd31+ cells inside cd4+cd25+ between males and females .

sle patients display higher frequency of cd4+foxp3+ cells which are mainly cd25-
given the major involvement of foxp <dig> in the differentiation and function of treg, we analyzed the frequency of foxp3+ cells in a subset of  <dig> patients and  <dig> healthy individuals. while the frequency of foxp3+ cells in cd4+pbmc was not significantly different between patients and controls , the frequency of cd25+ in the cd4+foxp3+ cell subset was significantly reduced in patients when compared to healthy controls  . in contrast, foxp3-cd25+ activated cells were significantly increased in sle patients  . this diminished expression of cd <dig> in patients' foxp3+ cells indicates that the overall reduction in cd4+cd25+ cells in sle patients likely results specifically from a defect in the ability to convert foxp3+cd25- into foxp3+cd25+ cells.

cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency is negatively correlated with sle-associated phenotypes
autoantibody production against dsdna is a hallmark of sle. we therefore analyzed the plasma immunoreactivity profiles against dsdna from sle patients, relatives and healthy individuals. overall, there is a negative correlation between treg frequency and anti-dsdna in the total population  , reinforcing the notion that perturbations in the system that maintains immunologic unresponsiveness to self-constituents lead to the loss of peripheral tolerance and to sle. this negative correlation between anti-dsdna autoantibodies and the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells was also found in our patient  and control groups  . surprisingly, there is a positive correlation between the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells and anti-dsdna antibodies in the relatives' group  . no difference was found between males and females.

the cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency was inversely correlated with disease activity measured by the sledai index  . however, no correlation was found with the slicc damage index . there was no significant difference between the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells in patients untreated or treated with corticosteroids , antimalarial agents , or both drugs . noteworthy, no correlation was found between total lymphocyte counts and the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell , excluding the possibility that lymphopenia led to this phenotype. there was also no correlation with age .

variation of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency with the development and remission of sle-related symptoms
in two sle patients variations in cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency as a function of disease onset and progression and with treatment were evaluated. a 33-year-old caucasian woman was initially enrolled in this study as a healthy relative of an sle patient. at the time of recruitment, the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells in this subject was  <dig> % . one year later, this woman presented classical sle clinical symptoms, lymphopenia, positive anti-dsdna antibody, positive lupic anticoagulant and a sledai of  <dig>  upon establishment of the diagnosis of sle, a new measurement of treg frequency showed a decrease to  <dig> % , suggesting the involvement of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency in the onset of symptoms. in a second case a 67-year-old female sle patient, diagnosed three years before, developed an sle flare with symptoms of acute isquemic stroke, hemolytic anemia, impaired renal function, antinuclear, anti-dsdna and anticardiolipin antibodies and hipocomplementemia. the sledai score was  <dig>  a regimen of low-dose corticosteroids and antimalarials had previously provided a good control of disease. at this point the cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency was  <dig> % . after anticoagulant and intravenous corticosteroid therapies, the cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency was  <dig> % . in addition to anticoagulants and intravenous corticosteroids therapies, ivig therapy administration was deemed necessary. upon ivig treatment, the patient's cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency increased to  <dig> %  and she showed progressive clinical and laboratorial improvement, and the sledai score decreased to  <dig> after three weeks of treatment. taken together these results support the idea that decreased cd25+ t cell frequency is associated with disease activity.

peripheral cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency is highly heritable
relatives of sle patients presented intermediate cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequencies between patients and controls , suggesting that treg frequency might represent a genetic trait. any potential bias due to recruitment design was excluded based on the following observations: for each family all samples were collected and processed on the same day; there were no significant differences in treg frequency between families collected in different days. treg frequencies in genetically unrelated family members and in controls collected and processed on the same day are within the range of healthy controls analyzed during the whole period of the study.

a high cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency heritability, defined as the proportion of variation of this trait attributable to genetic factors, was estimated at  <dig>  ±  <dig>   . as for most complex traits, there was no clear segregation pattern of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency with affection status in the families. however, because relatives often present sle-related autoimmunity symptoms even when not meeting the full diagnostic criteria, we tested the association of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency with the severity of these suboptimal autoimmune symptoms through a 10-item survey questionnaire administered to patients and relatives . the number of positive answers was inversely correlated with the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells  , as expected if the extent of clinical manifestations is associated with the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells. the results therefore provide evidence that cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells frequency constitutes a genetic trait associated with sle manifestations, which can be used for genetic mapping.

lower frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells is associated with specific ctla <dig> and tgfβ gene variants
the evidence for familiar transmission prompted us to test putative functional polymorphisms in the candidate genes ctla <dig>  tgfβ, foxp <dig>  il <dig> and cd <dig> for association with cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency. all genotypic distributions were in hwe and all the polymorphic markers within the same gene were in ld. a significant association of the ctla <dig> 3'utr microssatelite marker with cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency was found , with genotypes 104/ <dig> and 106/ <dig> associated with lower  and higher  frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells, respectively . this result is particularly relevant because, in our sample, allele  <dig> has previously been found to increase susceptibility to disease, while allele  <dig> showed a protective effect  <cit> . the tgfβ rs <dig> snp was also significantly associated with the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells . heterozygosis was associated with lower frequencies of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells . because the c allele has very low frequency in the general population , there were no homozygous individuals for this allele in our sample.

                              p
n represents the number of individuals.

both the foxp <dig> rs <dig> snp and the intron  <dig> marker, located in the promoter/enhancer region of the gene, were nominally associated with sle  . the a allele of rs <dig> was more frequent in patients than in controls. the susceptibility allele  <dig> of the intron  <dig> microsatellite marker was more frequent in patients  and a protective allele  <dig> more frequent in controls  . no association was found with cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency . there was no evidence for association of any other tested gene marker with cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency or with sle .

                              p
allele and genotype frequencies, χ <dig> test and odds ratio for the foxp <dig> rs <dig>  intron  <dig> and intron  <dig> microssatelites in sle patients and healthy individuals.

taken together these results indicate that ctla <dig> and tgfβ gene variants contribute to the determination of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency in pbmc, independently of disease activity, while the involvement of foxp <dig> gene variants in sle is likely not mediated by cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency.

no correlation was found between ctla- <dig>  tgf-β, il- <dig> or cd <dig> expression levels and the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells, disease status or marker genotypes . there was a trend towards higher levels of foxp <dig> mrna in sle patients, although not significant , and in individuals carrying the a allele of foxp <dig> rs <dig> . these results suggest that variability in cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency associated with sle is not influenced by altered expression of any of the tested genes.

discussion
the present study supports and expands previous observations of decreased cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency in sle patients. it further demonstrates a clear gender difference in the distribution of this regulatory t cell subset and provides evidence suggesting that cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency variation may result from a defect in the conversion of foxp3+cd25- into foxp3+cd25+cells. cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency is shown to be negatively correlated with disease activity and with anti-dsdna antibodies in the patient and control groups, and to change with development and remission of sle symptoms in two documented cases. the study also established that the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells is highly heritable in families affected with sle, that it is negatively correlated with the severity of sle-associated manifestations in patients and relatives, and that it is influenced by genetic variants in the ctla <dig> and tgfβ genes.

we initially analyzed the frequency of treg with the available anti-cd <dig> an cd45ro antibodies as described by jonuleit et al.  <cit> , who have demonstrated that human cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells are highly enriched in t cells with suppressor properties. cd <dig> and cd45ro are also markers of activation and one could argue that our measurement concerned conventional activated cells. several observations indicate that this is not the case. first, the total frequency of cd45ro+ cells was not significantly different between patients' and controls' pbmc, indicating that conventional activated cells are not enriched in sle patients' pmbc. second, once a foxp <dig> antibody became available, we have tested this marker in a subset of patients. all together our analyses reveal that, when compared to controls, patients had a significantly decreased frequency of cd25+ cells of either the cd4+ cd45ro+ or the foxp3+ phenotype, supporting the notion that the cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell subset is enriched in treg. hence, the analyses we presented here most likely concern bona fide treg. furthermore, while the cd4+foxp3+ cell subset was comparable between patients and controls, patients had a significantly higher frequency of foxp3+ cd25- cells, suggesting that they are unable to convert foxp3+ cd25- into foxp3+ cd25+ cells. previous observations endorse this hypothesis: sle patients display multiple signaling defects leading to a defective il- <dig> production  <cit> , and cd4+foxp3+ thymocytes from il-2-/- mice have very few cells expressing cd <dig> when compared to wild type mice  <cit> . in fact, il- <dig> does not seem to be required for the induction of foxp <dig> expression but is required for the survival and expansion of treg cells in the periphery, leading to autoimmune manifestations.

the percentage of cd45ro-cd31+ rte was not correlated with disease or with cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency, ruling out a defect in thymic export. the faster decrease rate of cd4+cd25+ cd31+ cells in sle patients, however, is indicative of a specific thymic defect leading to a decreased treg production and thus contributing to the lower frequency of these cells in the periphery. the observed decrease of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency in patients might also result from cell migration to the sites of inflammation. however, this hypothesis seems unlikely because patients with rheumatoid arthritis display enriched cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells not only in inflamed joints but also in peripheral blood  <cit> .

the difference found in cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency between males and females is remarkable, given the much higher prevalence of sle in females. this difference is very significant in the control population, suggesting this may be a gender specific trait that renders females more susceptible to sle. the lack of significance in the patient group may be due to the very small number of males, while in the relatives' group this might be explained by the high heterogeneity of this population, where only some individuals carry the disease susceptibility factors.

the significant negative correlation of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency with anti-dsdna antibodies observed in the patients and in the relatives suggests that these cells may be able to inhibit antinuclear antibody production by b cells, and therefore an additional mechanism through which loss of immunological tolerance may be achieved in sle. this phenomenon may also occur in the relatives, but the fact that they display a positive correlation between cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency and anti-dsdna antibodies may represent a compensation effect in which the relatives' are able to overcome this pathogenic mechanism.

cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency was also associated with disease activity and with the extent of clinical manifestations. this suggests a direct involvement in disease development and prognosis, which is corroborated by the variation observed with onset and remission of symptoms in the two documented cases. the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells was not associated with the use of immunosuppressive drugs. whether these therapies affect basal frequencies of treg was not addressed in the present work as it would require longitudinal studies. interestingly, in one case the clinical improvement that followed ivig administration was associated with increased cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency, suggesting that this treatment may influence treg generation or maintenance  <cit> .

the cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency was highly heritable in the affected families and was also strongly correlated with the extent of autoimmune manifestations in patients and in affected and unaffected relatives, in concordance with the clustering of autoimmune diseases and/or autoimmune-related phenotypes observed in these families. these findings are of particular importance because they show a contribution of genetic factors to the decrease in cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency and thus substantiate a genetic basis for sle. although we still cannot establish whether the decrease in cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells is a cause or a consequence of autoimmune manifestations in sle, we show evidence for the existence of genetic factors that, by influencing this trait, may contribute to sle.

the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells likely results from a combination of processes regulating their expansion and survival in the periphery, and therefore multiple genetic factors may contribute to this trait. this study provided evidence for an involvement of the ctla <dig> and tgfβ genes. the specific polymorphisms associated with cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ cell frequency were not correlated with ctla- <dig> and tgf-β mrna expression level variation; expression levels in turn were not associated with cell variation or with disease status, indicating that a functional defect in these genes, rather than changes in expression levels, contributes to the observed cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell phenotype in sle patients.

in mouse models the generation and expansion of treg are dependent on ctla- <dig> and tgf-β respectively,  <cit> . ctla-4-/- animals have reduced numbers of cd4+cd25+ t cells with reduced regulatory capacity, while tgf-β regulates the treg cell pool size and expression of the treg commitment factor foxp <dig>  <cit> . tgfβ has also been shown to induce cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cells in vitro, which were able to prevent a murine lupus-like syndrome and graft versus host disease  <cit> . in humans, it was demonstrated that it has the capacity to expand cd4+cd25+ in normal subjects  <cit> . our results therefore extend the role of these genes in the regulation of treg frequency and autoimmunity to humans.

other treg specific candidate genes that may contribute to the determination of the size of the treg pool are the foxp <dig> commitment factor and the il <dig> and cd <dig> genes, which deliver crucial growth and/or survival signals to these cells. in the study population, a promoter polymorphism  in the foxp <dig> gene was associated with sle but not with the frequency of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cells, indicating that susceptibility to the disease is mediated by mechanisms other than influencing treg frequency. the rs <dig> allele a associated with sle creates a putative binding site to the transcriptional activator plag <dig> in the foxp <dig> promoter region, which may explain the slightly higher foxp <dig> mrna expression found in sle patients. a compensatory mechanism can be hypothesized to account for the maintenance of a normal mean cd4+foxp3+ cell frequency in patients even in the presence of increased frequency of this allele, and is plausible since foxp <dig> can be upregulated by other cytokines.

the il <dig> and cd <dig> genes were not associated with cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency or with sle. it should be remarked that the study population sample is small and that we focused on genotyping known functional polymorphisms because of their previously reported relevance, but did not fully cover genetic variation in any of these genes. our genetic results should therefore be considered preliminary.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we report that low peripheral cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency is a genetically determined predisposing factor for sle development. our results demonstrate the contribution of specific genes and suggest pathways involved in the establishment of cd4+cd25+cd45ro+ t cell frequency. whether a defect in number or function is a prerequisite for sle development remains to be understood. most importantly, our findings open new perspectives for therapy for sle patients based on the manipulation of treg. criteria for the selection of candidate patients for treg based therapy remains to be fully established but likely should include evaluation of treg frequency and analysis of genes involved in treg generation or maintenance, strongly benefiting the management of this autoimmune disease.
