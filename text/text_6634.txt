BACKGROUND
primordial germ cells in mice arise in the proximal extraembryonic mesoderm of the mouse embryo, and migrate to the embryonic gonad primordia  <cit> . in female mice, primordial germ cells that enter the embryonic ovaries divide mitotically until approximately embryonic day   <dig> . these mitotic oocyte progenitors are termed oogonia. oogonia enter meiosis after e <dig> , and are then termed oocytes. oocytes arrest in the diplotene stage of the first meiotic division.

initially, oocytes develop in clusters termed germ-cell nests . these nests arise through the processes of incomplete cytokinesis and cellular aggregation  <cit> . during the first few days after birth, the germ-cell nests break apart, and the oocytes individually become surrounded by somatic cells to form primordial follicles. temporally, the process of germ-cell nest breakdown and primordial-follicle formation is accompanied by the apoptotic cell death of approximately two-thirds of the oocytes. the surviving oocytes become surrounded by a single layer of somatic pre-granulosa cells, forming the primordial follicles  <cit> . primary follicles are formed from the primordial follicles as the oocytes start to grow and the surrounding somatic pre-granulosa cells become cuboidal and proliferative. the prevailing view in the field has been that the oocytes which are present in the primordial follicles of the ovaries represent the entire reservoir of gametes available to a female mouse throughout its reproductive life. however, a vigorous debate has developed over the existence of female germ-line stem cells in ovaries of mice and humans  <cit> .

breakdown of germ-cell nests and formation of primordial follicles are key early events in mammalian folliculogenesis. breakdown of germ-cell nests occurs during the same time window as the apoptotic death of approximately two-thirds of the oocytes within those nests; however, the mechanistic connection between these two events is not clear. it has long been known that exposure of neonatal mice to various estrogenic compounds results in formation of multi-oocyte follicles, and it is believed that defects in the process of germ-cell nest breakdown leads to the formation of these multi-oocyte follicles  <cit> .

the notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved, intercellular signaling mechanism  <cit> . notch signaling frequently plays a crucial role in precursor cells, making binary cell-fate decisions. however, notch signaling also regulates additional developmental decisions, such as boundary formation between cell populations, cell proliferation, and cell death. notch family receptors are large single-pass type i transmembrane proteins. in mammals, four notch family receptors have been described, encoded by the notch <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes.

a notch family receptor exists at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved, non-covalently associated heterodimer, consisting of a large ectodomain and a membrane-tethered intracellular domain. during canonical notch signaling, notch receptors interact with ligands that are also single-pass type i transmembrane proteins. this restricts the notch pathway to regulating juxtacrine intercellular interactions. in mammals, the canonical notch ligands are encoded by the jagged  and delta-like  gene families.

the signal induced by ligand binding is transmitted intracellularly by a process involving proteolytic cleavage of the receptor and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain of the notch family protein. the receptor/ligand interaction induces two additional proteolytic cleavages in the membrane-tethered fragment of the notch heterodimer. the final cleavage, catalyzed by the gamma-secretase complex, frees the intracellular domain of the notch receptor from the cell membrane. the cleaved fragment translocates to the nucleus owing to the presence of nuclear localization signals located in the notch intracellular domain. once in the nucleus, the notch intracellular domain forms a complex with a sequence-specific dna binding protein, the rbpj protein, , and activates transcription of notch target genes.

notch signaling plays an essential role during oogenesis in drosophila, and is required at several different stages of oocyte development  <cit> . recent work has suggested that notch signaling probably also plays an essential role during oogenesis and ovary development in mammals. the notch <dig> receptor is expressed at high levels in pre-granulosa  <cit>  and granulosa  <cit>  cells of the neonatal and adult mouse ovary, and ex vivo culture of neonatal mouse ovaries in gamma-secretase inhibitors  resulted in defects in granulosa-cell proliferation and primordial-follicle formation  <cit> . however, no in vivo loss-of-function studies have been performed to establish whether notch family receptors have an essential physiological role during normal ovary development. mice homozygous for a notch <dig> null allele die early during embryogenesis  <cit> , thus necessitating a conditional gene-deletion strategy to examine the requirement for notch <dig> gene function during oogenesis.

in this paper, we report that notch <dig> gene function in the somatic-cell lineage of the mouse ovary is essential for breakdown of germ-cell nests and formation of primordial follicles, and that notch <dig> function in granulosa cells non-cell-autonomously regulates apoptosis of oocytes in the early postnatal period.

RESULTS
female amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice exhibit reduced fertility
the notch <dig> gene is expressed at high levels in granulosa cells, the somatic-cell lineage of the ovarian follicle. to assess whether notch <dig> gene function is required for correct development of the mouse ovary, we conditionally deleted the notch <dig> gene in the somatic lineages of the mouse ovary using the anti-müllerian hormone type ii receptor- cre recombinase  driver line  <cit> . using southern blotting analysis, we found efficient excision of the notch2flox allele by the amhr2-cre line in ovary dna, but not in spleen dna . female amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- and control littermate mice were mated to wild-type c57bl/6j male mice over a 6-month period, then we assessed the fertility and reproductive performance of both groups of mice. the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice exhibited reduced fertility compared with the littermate controls. female amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice had only approximately one-third as many progeny as control littermates over the 6-month period, even though amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice had similar total litter numbers to the controls .

notch <dig> gene deletion in granulosa cells leads to formation of multi-oocyte follicles and persistence of germ-cell nests
histological analysis of ovaries taken from amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice at  <dig> weeks of age identified the presence of multi-oocyte follicles . this phenotype was completely penetrant, as all amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice developed multi-oocyte follicles. as many as  <dig> oocytes were present in a single follicle in the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- ovaries. by  <dig> weeks of age, the follicles in the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mutant ovaries became hemorrhagic .

the presence of multi-oocyte follicles in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice suggests that notch2-mediated signaling may be required for breakdown of the primordial germ-cell nests. in wild-type mice, breakdown of germ-cell nests and formation of primordial follicles are normally complete within a few days of birth. histological analyses on ovaries isolated at postnatal day   <dig> from amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- and control littermate mice showed that, whereas virtually all germ-cell nests in the control mice had broken down to form primordial follicles, there was persistence of germ-cell nests in the cortex of the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- ovaries . this was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of ovaries isolated at pnd <dig>  using an antibody to the cytoplasmic germ-cell marker vasa . in littermate control ovaries at pnd <dig>  most vasa-positive cells had already been assembled into individual primordial follicles . however, in the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- ovaries, most vasa-positive cells, particularly near the cortical surface of the ovary, remained in germ-cell nests . by pnd <dig>  laminin immunostaining showed that in control littermate mice, the primordial follicles in the cortex of the ovary were surrounded by a basement membrane , whereas in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- ovaries, the oocytes remained in the germ-cell nests and were not individually surrounded by a basement membrane . these data indicate that notch <dig> gene function in pre-granulosa cells is required for breakdown of the primordial germ-cell nests and assembly of primordial follicles.

ovaries of amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice have increased numbers of oocytes but decreased numbers of primordial follicles
to quantify oocyte numbers in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- and control littermate mice, we counted serial sections of ovaries isolated at pnd <dig>  this time point was chosen because it is a point shortly before the female mouse reaches sexual maturity. amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice had approximately 20% more oocytes than ovaries from littermate controls . we then quantified the type of follicle present  and assessed whether these follicles contained a single oocyte, two or three oocytes, or four or more oocytes . for all follicle types, only the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice had four or more oocytes per follicle present in the ovaries . we divided the follicles into two categories: the resting pool  and the growing pool . the pnd <dig> amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- ovaries contained significantly fewer total follicles , and also significantly fewer follicles in the resting pool  . a significantly reduced number of normal primordial follicles was seen in the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- ovaries. the mutant mice had approximately nine-fold fewer primordial follicles containing a single oocyte than did their littermate controls , and had  <dig> times more primordial follicles containing four or more oocytes than controls . regarding the growing pool, the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- ovaries had significantly more primary and secondary follicles containing four or more oocytes, and also had more follicles of the primary, secondary, and pre-antral types containing two to three oocytes . however, at pnd <dig> the total number of follicles in the growing pool  was not significantly different in the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- and their littermate controls .

we used the pnd <dig> oocyte quantification data to estimate the fraction of primordial germ-cell nests that failed to break down properly in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice. we combined the oocyte numbers from all follicle types , and assessed in both control littermate and amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice  whether the follicles contained a single oocyte, or more than one oocyte . in the control mice,  <dig> % of the follicles contained a single oocyte, and the remaining  <dig> %  contained more than one oocyte. in the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mutants,  <dig> % of the follicles contained a single oocyte, and the remaining  <dig> %  contained more than one oocyte. assuming that all multi-oocyte follicles resulted from a failure of primordial germ-cell-nest breakdown, these data suggest that approximately 40% of the primordial germ-cell nests in the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice failed to break down and assemble into follicles with a single oocyte each.

notch <dig> gene function in granulosa cells is required for non-cell autonomous oocyte apoptosis
to address the mechanisms responsible for the 20% increase in oocyte numbers in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice, we assessed cell proliferation  incorporation) and apoptotic cell death  assay) in ovaries of amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- and control littermate mice. in wild-type mouse embryos, oogonia cease mitosis and enter meiosis at approximately embryonic day  <dig> . we assessed whether oocytes were still proliferating in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- embryos during the period e <dig>  to e <dig> , using brdu injection into timed pregnant females. ovaries from the embryos of the brdu-injected females were isolated and sectioned, and oocytes were identified by immunofluorescence staining with an antibody to the cytoplasmic germ-cell marker vasa. we identified no oocytes throughout the period e <dig>  to e <dig> , in either amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- embryos or their littermate controls, which were double-stained with the anti-vasa and anti-brdu antibodies . we next examined cell proliferation in the ovaries of neonatal mice at pnd <dig> and pnd <dig> by brdu injection at these time points. quantifying either all brdu-positive cells  or brdu-positive pre-granulosa/granulosa cells  , we detected no significant differences in the numbers of proliferating cells between the control and the amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- ovaries at either pnd <dig> or pnd <dig>  similarly to the embryonic brdu exposure , we did not find any oocytes that were double-stained with the anti-vasa and anti-brdu antibodies, in either amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- embryos or their littermate controls, at pnd <dig> or pnd <dig> . therefore, it did not appear that excess or extended proliferation was the cause of the increase in oocyte numbers in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice.

we next assessed apoptotic programmed cell death using tunel . counting either tunel-positive oocytes   or tunel-positive pre-granulosa/granulosa cells  , we detected significantly fewer apoptotic cells of either type in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mutant ovaries at pnd <dig>  by pnd <dig>  the numbers of apoptotic cells  were not significantly different in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- and control ovaries. these data support a model in which the increase in oocyte number in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mutant ovaries is caused by reduced oocyte apoptotic cell death during the early postnatal stages.

discussion
using a tissue-specific, conditional gene-deletion strategy, we investigated the role of the notch <dig> gene in the mouse ovary by generating a granulosa-cell-specific notch <dig> gene deletion with the amhr2-cre driver. our results showed that notch <dig> deletion in granulosa cells resulted in reduced fertility in the conditional mutant female mice, accompanied by the formation of multi-oocyte follicles that became hemorrhagic as the mice aged. formation of multi-oocyte follicles resulted from defects in breakdown of the primordial germ-cell nests. in the ovaries of the notch <dig> conditional mutant females, oocyte numbers were increased as a result of decreased oocyte apoptosis, but the number of normal primordial follicles containing a single oocyte was greatly decreased.

previous studies have shown that the notch <dig> gene is expressed at high levels in the somatic pre-granulosa  <cit>  and granulosa  <cit>  cell lineage of the mouse ovary. in addition, ex vivo culture of neonatal mouse ovaries with gamma-secretase inhibitors  resulted in defects in granulosa-cell proliferation and primordial-follicle formation  <cit> , whereas overexpression of the notch <dig> intracellular domain in these ex vivo cultures promoted granulosa-cell proliferation and rescued the growth inhibition induced by the gamma-secretase inhibitors  <cit> . our study is the first genetic loss-of-function study confirming that notch receptor function plays an essential physiological role in mammalian oogenesis and ovary development. in the notch <dig> conditional deletion model, multi-oocyte follicles arise from persistence of germ-cell nests and reduced germ-cell apoptosis, indicating a non-cell autonomous effect on oocyte survival. these data provide in vivo evidence for the crucial function of the notch <dig> gene in breakdown of germ-cell nests, postnatal apoptosis of oocytes, and formation of primordial follicles.

other genetic mouse models that develop multi-oocyte follicles have been reported. these include targeted null mutations for dmrt <dig>  <cit> , ahch/dax <dig>  <cit> , gcnf  <cit> , ghr  <cit> , bmp15/gdf <dig> double mutants  <cit> , foxc <dig>  <cit> , the notch signaling modulator lfng  <cit> , and transgenic mice with gain of function for rat inhibin-α  <cit> . however, a common feature of these models is the formation of multi-oocyte follicles with only a few  oocytes in a single follicle, rather than the large numbers of oocytes seen in the multi-oocyte follicles of amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice. one exception is the generation of mice with multi-oocyte follicles by neonatal administration of various estrogenic compounds, which also results in formation of multi-oocyte follicles containing large numbers of oocytes  <cit> . in that system, formation of multi-oocyte follicles is dependent on estrogen-receptor signaling. formation of multi-oocyte follicles in neonatal mice treated with the soybean-derived phytoestrogen genistein was dependent on the presence of a functional β estrogen receptor  but not on the α estrogen receptor   <cit> . mice homozygous for a targeted mutation of the esr <dig> gene, which encodes erα, formed multi-oocyte follicles when treated as neonates with genistein. however, mice that were homozygous mutant for the esr <dig> gene  did not form multi-oocyte follicles under these conditions, showing that erα function is required for formation of multi-oocyte follicles after neonatal genistein administration. more recent work suggested that, depending on which estrogenic compound is delivered to the neonatal mice, erα may also be required for multi-oocyte follicle formation  <cit> . estrogen-receptor signaling might also contribute to the hemorrhagic follicle phenotype exhibited by amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice. mice mutant for erα develop hemorrhagic follicles  <cit>  similar to those of the notch <dig> conditional mutant mice, and this phenotype is exacerbated in erα-erβ double mutants  <cit> . it will be extremely interesting to determine if estrogen-receptor-mediated signaling from either the erα or erβ receptor contributes to the mutant phenotypes seen in amhr2-cre/+;notch2flox/- mice.

our results clearly show that notch <dig> function in somatic granulosa cells is required for breakdown of germ-cell nests and formation of primordial follicles. however, the identity and cellular source of the notch ligand interacting with the notch <dig> receptor in granulosa cells is not known. the model we favor is that expression of the jagged family ligands jag <dig> and/or jag <dig> in the oocyte is the source of the ligand signal. communication between the oocyte and the surrounding somatic cells  is essential for the coordinated development of both the germ-cell and somatic-cell lineages  <cit> . gene expression analyses have indicated that only the two jagged family ligands jag <dig> and jag <dig> are expressed at high levels in the oocyte; delta family ligands are expressed only at low to undetectable levels in the developing ovary  <cit> . recent work has shown that jag1-notch <dig> signaling is downstream of neurotrophin 4/ <dig> and brain-derived neurotrophic factor -tyrosine-related kinase  receptor b signaling in the ovarian follicle  <cit> . expression of the jag <dig> gene and the notch target genes hes <dig> and hey <dig> is reduced in the ovaries of trkb homozygous mutants at pnd <dig>  however, the trkb homozygous mutant mice do not exhibit multi-oocyte follicles, indicating that upstream neurotrophin-trk receptor signaling cannot explain all aspects of the notch <dig> granulosa-cell-specific deletion phenotype.

however, another possible source for the ligand signal is via jag <dig> expression in the granulosa cells themselves. in situ hybridization analysis indicates that the jag <dig> gene is expressed more strongly in granulosa cells than in the oocyte  <cit> . disruption of cis inhibition  <cit>  of notch2-mediated signaling by expression of the ligand jag <dig> in granulosa cells is an alternative model to explain the requirement for notch <dig> function in somatic granulosa cells. determining where the relevant ligand signal is coming from  by conditional gene-deletion experiments will be essential to obtain mechanistic understanding of how breakdown of germ-cell nests, postnatal apoptosis of oocytes, and formation of primordial follicles are regulated in wild-type mice, and how these processes are disrupted in the notch <dig> conditional deletion model.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that notch2-mediated signaling in the somatic-cell lineage of the mouse ovary is essential for regulating breakdown of germ-cell nests and formation of primordial follicles. female mice with conditional deletion of the notch <dig> gene in somatic granulosa cells of the ovary exhibited reduced fertility, accompanied by the formation of multi-oocyte follicles. formation of multi-oocyte follicles resulted from defects in breakdown of the primordial germ-cell nests. ovaries of the notch <dig> conditional mutant mice had increased numbers of oocytes, but decreased numbers of primordial follicles. oocyte numbers in the notch <dig> conditional mutants were increased not by excess or extended cellular proliferation, but as a result of decreased oocyte apoptosis. this model provides a new resource for studying the developmental and physiological role of notch signaling during mammalian reproductive biology.
