BACKGROUND
proteases play key roles in the regulation of many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, apoptosis, and the activation of chromosome disjunction in mitosis  <cit> . artificial proteolytic regulation is possible using tev protease, which recognizes a highly specific sequence  <cit>  and is not deleterious when expressed in a variety of cell types  <cit> . artificial cleavage of target proteins, engineered to contain a tev cleavage sequence , can thus be effected by tev protease expression in vivo. tev protease-mediated cleavage has been used in topological studies of protein location  <cit>  and to study the role of regulatory proteolysis, such as in analysis of separase function  <cit> . proteolytic cleavage can be used to determine how removal of specific domains of a protein affects its function  <cit>  and, by removing a signal that targets the protein to a specific compartment, can effect a change in a protein's cellular localization  <cit> .

we investigate here the utility of tev-mediated cleavage of nuclear proteins in fission yeast. we demonstrate that a strain expressing nuclear-targeted tev protease has no growth defects compared to a wild-type strain and shows efficient cleavage of nuclear proteins containing a tcs. we use tev protease-mediated cleavage to investigate the function of cdc <dig> , which is an essential replication protein, required for the initiation and elongation steps of dna replication . cdc23/mcm <dig> is chromatin associated, and in s. cerevisiae and vertebrate cells this association occurs during s phase  <cit> , but its biochemical function is unclear. in s. cerevisiae, mcm <dig> was originally implicated in pre-replicative complex formation, when mcm2- <dig> proteins associate with orc at replication origins  <cit> . subsequent studies in both yeasts and xenopus have shown that mcm <dig> is required for the later step of replication initiation, as the protein is needed for chromatin association of cdc <dig>  <cit> . in vitro, fission yeast cdc <dig> enhances the ability of hsk <dig>  protein kinase to phosphorylate mcm <dig>  <cit> , and binds to the catalytic subunit of dna polymerase α-primase , catalytically activating its dna polymerase activity  <cit> . very recently, ricke and bielinsky have shown that mcm <dig> is required for the stability of the pol α catalytic subunit in s. cerevisiae  <cit> .

in this paper, we use tev protease cleavage of cdc <dig> to show that removal of a  <dig> aa c-terminal domain of the protein, previously with no attributed functions, blocks dna replication. regulation of tev protease under the thiamine-repressible nmt <dig> promoter in conjunction with a tcs-containing allele of cdc <dig> can thus be used to inactivate conditionally the protein. we show in addition that inactivation of cdc <dig> affects the chromatin binding and nuclear distribution of the dna primase catalytic subunit  of pol α-primase.

RESULTS
expression of tev protease in s. pombe and cleavage of mcm7-tcs-gfp
to explore the utility of using tev protease to construct conditional alleles in s. pombe, we constructed a strain where tev protease, conjugated to nuclear localization signals , is expressed under the control of the thiamine-regulatable nmt <dig> promoter. a strain expressing tev protease is viable over a range of temperatures , and no effects on growth rate or dna contents of cells as assessed by flow cytometry were detected . to demonstrate that this tev protease is capable of cleaving nuclear proteins, we modified a strain expressing mcm7-gfp to contain a tcs between the c-terminus of mcm <dig> and gfp . mcm <dig> forms a complex with five other mcm subunits , and probably provides the helicase function during the initiation and elongation steps of dna replication . western blot analysis showed that expression of tev protease efficiently removed the gfp tag from mcm <dig> . mcm <dig> is present in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle  <cit>  , in common with other mcm subunits, but on expression of the tev protease, the gfp fluorescence becomes delocalized over the entire cell , showing that the test substrate is efficiently cleaved on protease induction. the small size of the c-terminal gfp fragment presumably allows it to exit the nucleus by passive diffusion, consistent with earlier studies <cit> .

inactivation of cdc <dig> by tev protease cleavage
a number of functions have been ascribed to the cdc23/mcm <dig> replication factor and some of these have been mapped to specific domains of the protein , such as in vitro stimulation of hsk <dig> phosphorylation of mcm <dig>  <cit>  and stimulation of pol α-primase function  <cit> . mcm <dig> contains a region encompassing a zn-finger motif that is important for formation of high molecular weight mcm <dig> homocomplexes  <cit>  and a large segment of the protein has been reported to be needed for interaction with the mcm2- <dig> complex. most of these domains map to the n-terminal and central regions of the protein . all mapped cdc <dig> temperature-sensitive  mutations also map to a central  region. the function of the c-terminal portion of the protein, which is less well conserved than n-terminal and central domains, is unclear as a c-terminally truncated version of s. pombe cdc <dig>  can complement the cdc23-m <dig> mutant  <cit> . however, the c-terminal region of s. cerevisiae mcm <dig> contains two nlss, at least one of which is needed for function of the protein  <cit> .

to determine if removal of a c-terminal domain of the cdc <dig> replication factor affects the function of the protein, we inserted a tcs just after serine  <dig> of a cfp-tagged version of cdc <dig>   <dig> aa from the c terminus, thus generating cdc23s424::tcs, . amino acids 1- <dig> of cdc <dig> contains most domains with ascribed functions and it was of interest to determine how cleavage after this region would affect the function of the protein. a poorly conserved region was chosen for the tcs insertion to minimize the possibility that this modification alone would inactivate the protein. the expression level of cdc23s424::tcs is the same as the wild-type protein . a strain containing this insertion is viable at all temperatures in the absence of tev protease, implying that the tcs insertion does not affect cdc <dig> function, but induction of the tev protease prevents growth of this strain . unexpectedly, this effect shows temperature-sensitivity, in that the strain grows at temperatures up to about 32°c, but is not viable at 37°c. the cleavage site used generates a c-terminal fragment with a stabilizing n-terminal amino acid  as predicted by the n-end rule  <cit> , and we could detect two fragments of the expected size after induction of the protease . the proportion of full-length protein is reduced at 37°c on tev protease expression, consistent with the temperature-sensitivity of the strain. the effect is unlikely to be due to an increase in tev protease activity, since the enzyme is more active at 32°c than 37°c  <cit>  and we observed efficient cleavage of a different substrate  at 32°c . instead, the tcs in cdc <dig> is presumably more accessible to the protease at higher temperatures, perhaps due to a change in conformation of cdc <dig>  allowing more efficient cleavage to occur.

cdc23/mcm <dig> appears to be required both for the initiation and elongation steps of dna replication, although ts alleles do not cause an abrupt block to dna replication in s. pombe, presumably reflecting leakiness of these mutations  <cit> . to determine the effect of cdc <dig> cleavage on dna replication, we arrested cells expressing cdc23s424::tcs in g <dig> by nitrogen starvation, and then released cells from the block under conditions where the tev protease was expressed . control cells, where the tev protease was not induced, executed dna replication at around  <dig> h after release , but in contrast expression of tev protease prevented dna replication , implying that the replication function of cdc <dig> is inactivated by separation of the c-terminal segment of the protein. under these conditions, expression of tev protease in a cdc23+ background is not deleterious . we also investigated how cleavage of the protein in a log phase culture affected dna replication. because de-repression of the nmt <dig> promoter by removal of thiamine is slow, taking 12– <dig> h, instead we first derepressed the promoter at 25°c, when the strain is viable. after tev protease induction, cells were shifted to 37°c to effect cdc23s424::tcs cleavage, which caused cells to arrest with slightly less than 2c dna content . cells are not blocked at the start of s phase but appear to arrest without completing dna replication. cdc <dig> levels are higher in a log-phase cells compared to nitrogen-starved cells  <cit>  which may make tev protease inactivation of cdc <dig> less efficient in this experiment.

nuclear localization or chromatin binding of cdc <dig> is not specified by the c-terminal region of the protein
the previous experiments establish that cdc23's replication function is abolished when the c-terminal  <dig> aa domain is cleaved off. to determine whether the c-terminal region has a function in nuclear localization, as shown in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , we followed the fate of the cfp-tagged c-terminal fragment after cdc23s424::tcs cleavage. expression of tev protease at 25°c had no effect on the nuclear localization of cdc <dig> , consistent with the viability of strain under these conditions and reduced cleavage of cdc23s424::tcs at lower temperatures . in contrast tev protease cleavage of cdc23s424::tcs at 37°c caused the cfp signal to become dispersed all over the cell, implying that the c-terminal fragment does not contain an nls. since the tev protease is targeted to the nucleus, we assume that this is the main location of cdc23s424::tcs cleavage. thus the lack of nuclear retention of the cleaved c-terminal fragment also implies that it is incapable of binding to chromatin, although it is possible that this region contributes to cdc <dig> chromatin binding in the context of the intact protein. in contrast to the c-terminal nlss of s. cerevisiae mcm <dig>  <cit> , cdc <dig> has a bipartite nls near the n-terminus of the protein , and taken together these results suggest that the region of the protein responsible for nuclear localization has not been conserved in evolution.

cleavage of cdc <dig> affects the chromatin association and nuclear distribution of dna polymerase α-primase
we used an in situ chromatin binding assay  <cit>  to determine how inactivation of cdc <dig> affects the chromatin association of pol α-primase and gins  complexes, which are both required for the initiation and elongation steps of dna replication. an earlier study has shown that the primase catalytic subunit, spp <dig>  is functional when c-terminally tagged with gfp and nuclear throughout the cell cycle  <cit> . however, cell cycle changes in chromatin association of spp1-gfp are revealed by detergent extraction of permeabilized cells, using a low salt extraction buffer . detergent washing removed spp <dig> from uninucleate  cells, but about 60% of binucleate  cells retained spp <dig> . arrest of dna replication with hydroxyurea  caused spp <dig> to become refractory to detergent extraction . taken together, these results suggest that this assay can be used to monitor the g1/s-dependent binding of pol α primase to chromatin and is broadly consistent with western analysis of chromatin-enriched fractions  <cit> .

cleavage of the cdc23s424::tcs protein in a strain also expressing spp1-gfp was effected by inducing the tev protease at 25°c, and then shifting to 37°c. in a wild-type strain, this temperature shift has no effect on spp1-gfp chromatin binding . in contrast to the effect of hu arrest on spp <dig> chromatin binding, cdc23s424::tcs cleavage caused a reduction in the proportion of cells retaining chromatin-associated spp <dig> . a reduction was also seen in thiamine-containing medium, probably reflecting leaky expression of tev protease from the nmt <dig> promoter under repressing conditions, leading to some cdc <dig> inactivation. we also observed a reduction in spp <dig> chromatin binding when tev protease was induced at 37°c in the absence of a temperature shift . in addition to an effect on spp <dig> chromatin binding, we observed a striking increase in the percentage of cells containing 1– <dig> bright foci of spp1-gfp after cdc <dig> inactivation . these were generally nuclear or peri-nuclear but not necessarily co-localizing with dapi-staining chromatin regions and may reflect formation of insoluble aggregates of spp <dig> after cdc <dig> inactivation. these foci were not observed during an hu-induced s phase arrest , so they appear to be a specific response to cdc <dig> inactivation.

chromatin association of pol α-primase has been reported to be dependent on cdc <dig>  <cit> . since cdc23/mcm <dig> can affect cdc <dig> chromatin association  <cit> , the effect on pol α-primase could be indirectly mediated by cdc <dig>  we therefore examined chromatin association of cdc45-yfp after tev protease inactivation of cdc23s424::tcs. in contrast to the effect on spp <dig>  cdc <dig> chromatin association was not prevented by tev protease cleavage of cdc <dig> and in fact there was an increase in the percentage of cells with chromatin-bound cdc <dig> . this is similar to what is observed in an hu arrest  <cit> , presumably reflecting accumulation of cells blocked in s phase. this result suggests that the essential function of the c-terminal region of cdc <dig> is not connected to cdc <dig> chromatin association and may be more directly related to pol α-primase function.

to examine whether pol α-primase was also affected by a different conditional allele of cdc <dig>  we also constructed a strain expressing spp1-gfp in the background of a degron cdc23tstd allele . in contrast to the effect of hu, a reduction in spp <dig> chromatin binding occurred on s phase arrest by cdc <dig> inactivation . as with the experiment using cdc23s424::tcs cleavage, degron inactivation of cdc <dig> also caused an increase in the proportion of cells showing foci of spp1-gfp . taken together these observations suggest that cdc <dig> is needed for the normal chromatin association and subnuclear distribution of pol α-primase.

the gins complex has been shown to be loaded onto chromatin at initiation in s. cerevisiae and xenopus  <cit>  and we examined whether this complex is also affected by disruption of cdc <dig> function. we first determined whether gins shows cell cycle dependent changes in detergent extractability. a strain where the psf <dig> subunit of gins is c-terminally tagged with yfp is viable and shows nuclear localization throughout the cell cycle . after detergent extraction, psf <dig> is only retained in binucleate cells, and is resistant to detergent extraction in hu-arrested cells , suggesting that the protein is chromatin associated in s phase similar to results obtained with spp <dig>  after shifting the cdc23tstd strain to the non-permissive temperature, psf <dig> becomes resistant to detergent extraction, similar to what is observed in an hu arrest . similar results were obtained after tev protease cleavage of cdc <dig> . this suggests cdc <dig> is not required to maintain psf <dig> chromatin association and execution of the cdc <dig> function is needed for displacement of psf <dig> in the course of s phase.

discussion
in this paper we demonstrate that in vivo cleavage by tev protease can be used to inactivate a modified version of the cdc <dig> replication factor, engineered to contain a cleavage site for the protease. we infer that the c-terminal  <dig> aa region is essential for the dna replication function of cdc <dig>  since n- and c-terminal fragments appear to be stable after cleavage, the c-terminal region must require covalent linkage to the rest of the protein for its function. although no clear sequence motifs have been identified in the c-terminal region, this part of the protein could have a discrete function that requires linkage to the n-terminal domain. alternatively, interaction between the n and c-terminal regions could simply be necessary for the function of the protein in a manner which is affected by tev protease cleavage. this function does not appear to involve nuclear localization or chromatin binding, since nuclear localization of the c-terminal fragment is lost after cdc <dig> cleavage .

we also show that inactivation of cdc <dig>  either by proteolytic cleavage or using a ts degron allele, affects the chromatin association and nuclear distribution of spp <dig> primase subunit , suggesting that an essential role of cdc <dig> is related to recruitment of pol α-primase to chromatin. cdc <dig> has also been implicated in binding of pol α-primase to chromatin  <cit> , but in this context it may not be relevant. although complete inactivation of cdc23/mcm <dig> can block chromatin association of cdc <dig>  <cit> , tev protease cleavage of cdc <dig> does not prevent cdc <dig> chromatin binding. one interpretation of these results is that mcm10/cdc <dig> has two functions, one related to pol α primase function, perhaps related to the c-terminal domain cleaved off by tev protease, and the other related to cdc <dig> chromatin binding.

these results are consistent with in vitro effects of s. pombe cdc <dig> on pol α-primase activity  <cit> , and evidence that s. cerevisiae mcm <dig> promotes chromatin binding of the large primase subunit  independently of effects on cdc <dig>  based on histone cross-linking experiments  <cit> . the observations we have made for spp1-gfp may also apply to the three other subunits of pol α-primase . however, given the requirement for s. cerevisiae mcm <dig> for stability of the p <dig> polymerase catalytic subunit  <cit>  and the constitutive chromatin binding of at least a fraction of s. pombe p <dig>  <cit> , further work will be needed to determine the fate of other pol α primase subunits on cdc <dig> inactivation.

in contrast to effects on spp <dig>  chromatin association of the psf <dig> subunit of gins is seen in cells arrested in s phase by using a degron allele of cdc <dig> , similar to the result obtained by an hu arrest of dna replication. this suggests that maintenance of gins chromatin association is independent of cdc <dig> function and that psf <dig> displacement requires cdc <dig> function in the elongation step of replication. at first glance, this result is inconsistent with previous work linking cdc <dig> with gins function. specifically, chromatin association of sld <dig> in xenopus extracts is blocked by cdc <dig> depletion  <cit> , and in s. cerevisiae, the sld <dig> partner of cdc <dig> is essential for psf <dig> origin association  <cit> . however, degradation of cdc <dig> using the cdc23tstd allele used in our experiments is inefficient in cycling cells  <cit>  and cdc <dig> chromatin binding is not blocked under conditions of the psf <dig> experiment shown in fig.  <dig> .

in this and a related study  <cit>  we have demonstrated the utility of tev protease for analysis of protein function in fission yeast. tev protease can be used to determine the role of specific domains of the protein and this method can be used for topological analysis of protein function by restricting tev protease expression to specific compartments. for this approach to be useful, the target protein must tolerate the insertion of a tcs, which was an issue with our related study on pol <dig> function  <cit>  and the tcs must be accessible to tev protease in the folded protein. in this study, cleavage of cdc23s424::tcs was more efficient at higher temperatures, possibly reflecting a conformational change in cdc <dig> which makes the tcs more accessible to the protease. alternatively, the interaction of cdc <dig> with other factors might be changed by temperature in a manner which affects access to the tcs.

in the approach used here, the tcs generates a c-terminal fragment with serine as the n-terminal amino acid, which is predicted to generate a stable protein. however, tev protease also cleaves sequences such as enlyfq∨r  <cit> , which generates a c-terminal fragment with a destabilizing n-terminal amino acid according to the n-end rule. such a module can be inserted at the n-terminus of the target protein, which may be more tolerated and accessible than insertion of the tcs at internal sites. we are currently investigating whether this strategy provides a simpler approach to effect rapid inactivation of target proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that tev protease can be used in s. pombe to inactivate target proteins engineered to contain a protease cleavage site. using this approach we show that the c-terminal domain of the cdc23/mcm <dig> replication factor, previously with no attributed functions, is essential for dna replication. inactivation of cdc23/mcm <dig> affects the chromatin binding and nuclear distribution of pol α-primase, suggesting it may help to attach the polymerase to the replication fork. in contrast, cdc23/mcm <dig> inactivation does not prevent maintenance of chromatin binding of the gins elongation factor, as judged by analysis of the psf <dig> subunit.
