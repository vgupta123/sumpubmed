BACKGROUND
fructan or glucan polymers are formed wherever microbes encounter sucrose-rich conditions, would it be in association with plants, in the oral cavity, in food manufacturing, or during bio-fuel production processes  <cit> . when plant-borne sucrose is present, the soybean-infecting bacterial blight pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea, uses levansucrase  to synthesize the extra-cellular high-molecular fructofuranan, levan, thereby releasing glucose for primary metabolism. three levansucrase-encoding genes, lsca, lscb, and lscc, were identified in p. syringae pv. glycinea pg <dig>  from which only lscb and lscc are expressed, as a mutant lacking lscb and lscc but possessing lsca is levan-deficient  <cit> . furthermore quantitative expression analysis of lsc genes by quantitative reverse transcriptase -pcr showed that lscb and lscc are actively expressed. however lsca is not being expressed due to an altered upstream region of lsca which does not seem to promote lsc expression  <cit> . both enzymes are synthesized maximally at 18°c in vitro and in planta and their expression is optimal at the early logarithmic growth stage  <cit> .

bacterial communities growing epiphytically on plants are primarily affected by carbon availability as supported by the finding that very low sugar concentrations are sufficient to support the growth of  <dig> to  <dig> cells per leaf  <cit> . stomatal openings and wounds provide the site of entry for p. syringae. under favorable micro-environmental conditions, the bacterial cells live endophytically and subsequently initiate the infection process via production of the phytotoxin coronatine  <cit>  and attachment to plant cell surfaces. the infection process is fostered by low environmental temperatures such as 18-20°c as opposed to the optimal growth temperature of p. syringae, 28°c  <cit> . a complex sequence of events mediated by injection of bacterial hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity  effector proteins into plant cells  <cit>  ultimately activates plant-borne k+ efflux and h+ influx, which increases the apoplastic ph from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . subsequently, this high extra-cellular ph induces efflux of the dominant photo assimilate, sucrose, from plant cells  <cit> . apoplastic sucrose ranging in concentrations from  <dig> μm to 1– <dig> mm is hydrolyzed by either plant-borne invertases or by extra-cellular microbial enzymes, e.g. lsc  <cit> .

for glucose metabolism, metabolic pathway structures vary among bacterial species with different ecological niches  <cit> . in contrast to enterobacteria  <cit> , pseudomonads utilize the entner-doudoroff  pathway due to lack of 6-phosphofructokinase and hence do not catabolize sugars via the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway  <cit> . the ed pathway can be linear, alternative, modified with non-phosphorylated intermediates, or cyclic  <cit>  and was first described in pseudomonas saccharophila, which now belongs to the order burkholderiales  <cit> .

the genes required for glucose metabolism in pseudomonas putida kt <dig> are organized in several operons  <cit> . the first operon consists of the zwf, pgl, and eda genes coding for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase , and eda   <cit> . divergently directed to this operon is the gene encoding for the hexose metabolic repressor, hexr  <cit> . the second operon consists of the edd and glk genes that encode 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase  and glucokinase , respectively  <cit> . divergently directed to this operon is the gene gap <dig> which codes for glyceraldehydes 3-phosphoste dehydrogenase  <cit> . the transcription of these genes and operons is negatively regulated by hexr. two monomers of hexr bind to the promoter regions of edd, zwf, and gap- <dig> genes by recognizing a palindromic sequence ttgtn7–8acaa  <cit> . in the current study, it was hypothesized that in p. syringae not only genes involved in cellular glucose metabolism but also genes encoding extra-cellular lsc were controlled by hexr. in turn, this might have consequences for our understanding about what determines bacterial in planta fitness and potentially virulence.

in order to address this hypothesis, a hexr mutant was generated in pg <dig> and tested for its growth in minimal medium containing glucose, sucrose, or arabinose as sole carbon source. analyses of lsc expression by qrt-pcr and western blotting were conducted for the pg <dig> wild type and its hexr mutant. the mutant was compared to the wild type in terms of its in planta fitness. furthermore, hypersensitive response  reactions and profiles of secreted proteins were compared for the wild type and the hexr mutant when grown under hrp-inducing conditions.

generation of hexr mutant in pg4180
a p. syringae pv. glycinea pg <dig> hexr mutant was generated using the broad-host-range flp-frt recombination system  <cit> . two fragments flanking the hexr gene were amplified from pg <dig> genomic dna using two pairs of primers: hexr_1f/hexr_1r and hex_2f/hexr_2r . pcr products were cloned into pgem-t easy  yielding plasmids pgem.hexr <dig> and pgem.hexr <dig> . a  <dig> -bp kpni fragment containing a kmr cassette flanked with frt sequences was removed from plasmid pfkm  <cit>  and ligated into kpni-digested pgem.hexr <dig>  yielding pgem.hexr1-km. a 360-bp spei-bamhi fragment digested from pgem.hexr <dig> was ligated into spei-bamhi-digested pgem.hexr1-km, yielding plasmid pgem.hexr-km. finally, a  <dig> -bp ecori fragment was removed from pgem.hexr-km and ligated into ecori-digested plasmid pex18ap  <cit> , yielding the hexr gene replacement plasmid pex.hexr-km. this plasmid was mobilized into p. syringae pg <dig> by tri-parental mating. putative mutants were screened on mg medium agar plates supplemented with kanamycin and were subsequently confirmed for the genotype by pcr using primers hex_up_fwd and hex_down_rev .table  <dig>

verification of the hexr mutant’s phenotype by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
template-specific primers were designed for hexr and lscb/c genes of p. syringae pg <dig>  bacterial cells were grown in hs + arabinose medium and harvested at an od <dig> of  <dig> . rna was extracted by acid phenol/chloroform extraction method  <cit> . rt-pcr was performed on total rna using revertaid first strand cdna synthesis kit . the hexr_fwd, hexr_rev, hexr-verif_fwd, hexr_verif_rev and lscb/c primers were used to check for presence of a hexr and lscb/c mrna by pcr using cdna as template. regular pcr with the same primer-pairs and genomic dna as template were used as control. the thermocycler program was as follows:  <dig> cycle of 95°c for  <dig> s;  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s, 60°c for  <dig> s, 72°c for  <dig> s;  <dig> cycle of 72°c for  <dig> min. the results were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.

analysis of lsc expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
bacterial cells were grown in hs + arabinose medium at 18°c. when cultures reached respective od <dig> values, total rna was isolated by acid phenol/chloroform extraction, and samples were normalized by multiplexed fluorescent northern hybridization and 23s rrna transcript amount comparison as described previously  <cit> . yield and purity of rna were determined by measuring absorption at  <dig> and 280 nm. total rna samples were treated with turbo dna-free  to remove remaining traces of genomic dna as described by the manufacturer’s recommendation.

sybr green-based qrt-pcr was performed with 1 ng normalized rna template and  <dig> nm primers  using the quantitect sybr green one-step rt-pcr kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the thermocycler program comprised an initial step of 95°c for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°c for 30 s, 55°c for 30 s, 72°c for 30 s. reactions were performed in technical duplicates and biological triplicates with a mastercycler® realplex <dig> real-time pcr system  as described by the manufacturer using their universal program. reactions with no addition of reverse transcriptase served as negative controls and proved lack of dna contamination. specificity of amplification was assessed by analyzing the melting curve of the amplification product. due to very high sequence identity between lscb and lscc it was not possible to design primers discriminating between these two mrnas, thereby expression profile of lsc is always referred as a combination of both genes.

immunological detection of lsc
generation and concentration of cell-free supernatants of p. syringae cells and the use of polyclonal antibodies were carried out as described previously  <cit> . cultures were grown in hs+ arabinose medium. equal aliquots of protein fractions were loaded  and separated by 10% sds-page. electrophoresis, electro-blotting on nitrocellulose membranes, and immunodetection were conducted by standard procedures  <cit> .

growth of pg <dig> wild type and hexr mutant in planta
in planta growth of pg <dig> and its hexr mutant was evaluated on soybean plants. soybean seedlings were germinated and grown in an environmentally controlled chamber for approximately three weeks prior to the growth assays. pg <dig> wild type and hexr mutant were incubated for  <dig> h at 28°c on mg agar plates. cells were suspended in distilled water, adjusted to an od <dig> of  <dig>   and applied to the leaves with an airbrush  until the leaf surfaces were uniformly wet. subsequently, humid environment was achieved by enclosing the inoculated plants with a clear plastic bag for overnight. inoculated plants were grown in a plant growth chamber  with a 12-hr light period. at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after inoculations, two individual leaves were randomly excised from plants corresponding to each inoculums and their weight was measured. epiphytic bacteria were isolated by placing leaves in a 50-ml falcon tubes containing  <dig> ml of external wash buffer  and the tubes were sonicated for  <dig> minutes  <cit> . leaves were then removed and macerated in  <dig> ml of isotonic solution  using sterile mortar and pestle. bacterial counts  were determined by plating dilutions from external wash buffer and leaf homogenate onto mg agar and counting of fluorescent colonies after incubation at 28°c for  <dig> h.

hypersensitive response assay on tobacco
tobacco plants  were grown in a light chamber at  <dig> to 25°c, 60% humidity, with a 12-h photoperiod . pg <dig> wild type and hexr mutant were incubated for  <dig> h at 28°c on mg agar. cells were suspended in sterile  <dig> % nacl, adjusted to an od <dig> of  <dig>  . tobacco plants were inoculated with bacterial suspensions by syringe injection of leaf veins of the third and fourth leaf. as negative control sterile  <dig> % nacl was used. infiltrated areas were monitored for development of the hypersensitive reaction in form of necrosis after  <dig> and  <dig> h.

extra-cellular protein pool preparation and sds-page
for sample preparation of secreted proteins, bacteria were grown in two consecutive overnight pre-cultures in king’s b broth  <cit>  at 28°c. from the first pre-culture, the cell suspension was adjusted to an od <dig> of  <dig>  with 50 ml of fresh king’s b broth and incubated at 28°c. bacterial cultures were harvested at an od <dig> of  <dig>  and centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 30 min. the bacterial cells were washed two times with hrp-inducing medium  <cit>  or with hs+ glucose medium  <cit> , respectively. subsequently, the cell pellets were resusp ended in 50 ml of hrp-inducing medium or hs+ glucose medium at 28°c and incubated shaking at 250 rpm for 4 h. next, 25 ml of the bacterial cultures were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 30 min. cell-free supernatant samples were prepared by filter-sterilization through  <dig> -μm pore size membrane filters and concentrated 50-fold using 10-kda millipore filters . extra-cellular protein samples were stabilized in 50 mm tris–hcl . total protein amounts were determined using a nanodrop apparatus , 10 μl of protein samples were separated by  <dig> % sds-page and subsequently visualized by silver staining according to established procedures  <cit> .

RESULTS
generation and genotypic characterization of the p. syringae hexr mutant
t del castillo, e duque and jl ramos  <cit>  and a daddaoua, t krell and jl ramos  <cit>  had previously shown that genes encoding enzymes of the phosphorylative branch and the ed pathway of glucose catabolism in p. putida were regulated by the hexose metabolism repressor, hexr. in p. syringae, extra-cellular lsc releases glucose by sucrose hydrolysis. in order to investigate the impact of hexr on expression of lscb and lscc genes, a hexr-deficient mutant of p. syringae pg <dig> was generated by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette in the hexr gene as a result of homologous recombination. the resulting mutant genotype was verified by growth on kanamycin-containing medium and rt-pcr analysis .

in silico analysis of hexr binding site upstream of lsc genes
analysis of the nucleotide sequences upstream of lscb and lscc, which are almost identical at nucleotide level  <cit> , revealed the presence of a sequence  with high similarity to the conserved motif ttgtn7–8acaa previously shown to be the dna binding site of hexr in p. putida  <cit>  . this finding suggested a putative binding of hexr of p. syringae to the upstream sequence of both lsc genes.figure  <dig>

comparison of different hexr protein sequences
multiple sequence alignments of several hexr protein sequences derived from lsc-producing p. syringae strains revealed that those proteins have a high pair-wise identity scores of >97% . pfam analysis  <cit>  of these proteins showed that there is a dna binding domain  and a sugar isomerase  binding domain  as described for p. putida kt <dig> by a daddaoua, t krell and jl ramos  <cit>   suggesting a similar way of enzymatic activity. a consensus sequence obtained from multiple alignments of hexr sequences from several p. syringae strains revealed 91% identity at the amino acid sequence level to that of p. putida .

in vitro and in planta growth of p. syringae pg <dig> and its hexr mutant
to compare the growth of pg <dig> wild type and its hexr mutant were grown in minimal media containing different carbon sources at 18°c . in contrast to the wild type, the hexr mutant did not grow significantly in hs medium containing  <dig> g/ml  of glucose. replacing glucose by  <dig> g/ml  of sucrose, thereby providing an equal total number of carbon atoms did not change the weak growth phenotype of the hexr mutant. however, growth of the wild type was unaffected by this change of carbon source.figure  <dig>

mutant . cultures are grown in hs minimal media supplemented with glucose, sucrose, or arabinose as sole carbon source at 18°c. error bars represent standard deviation of the mean of three biological replicates .



when glucose was replaced by an equal amount of 20 g/ml  arabinose as the sole carbon source, growth of the hexr mutant was not distinguishable from that of the wild type indicating that hexr might not be involved in regulation of pathways utilizing arabinose, and that the hexr mutant growth phenotype was restricted to glucose utilization . for the wild type, sucrose apparently allowed for a faster adaptation as sucrose-supplemented cultures grew faster during early logarithmic growth. no significant difference was observed for the hexr mutant grown on glucose- or sucrose-supplemented medium. arabinose allowed for the most efficient growth independent of the genotypes studied. these results indicated a potential hexr-mediated regulatory link of intra-cellular hexose metabolism with synthesis of lsc since sucrose is the source of glucose via the enzymatic activity of the later enzyme.

to analyze the effect of a hexr mutation on growth in planta, pg <dig> wild type and its hexr mutant were spray-inoculated onto soybean leaves with suspensions adjusted to  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml. subsequently, the plants were kept in a plant growth chamber and bacteria were recovered between days  <dig> to  <dig> post inoculation . results showed that the total population number and percentage of internalized bacteria were not significantly different between plants inoculated with pg <dig> wild type or its hexr mutant. however, a clear trend was observed for the percentage of bacteria that entered the interior of the leaf tissue. except for days  <dig> and  <dig>  plants inoculated with pg <dig> wild type showed a higher percentage of internalized bacterial population when compared to plants subjected to the hexr mutant. these results might indicate an important role of hexr for the in planta fitness of p. syringae.figure  <dig>

transcriptional analyses of lsc genes
to analyze the effect of the hexr mutation on lsc gene expression, a growth-phase dependent transcriptional analysis was conducted using qrt-pcr. cells of pg <dig> wild type and the hexr mutant were grown in minimal medium containing arabinose at 18°c since levan production was shown to be maximal at this temperature  <cit> . transcription of lsc genes in wild type and hexr mutant was highest during the early exponential growth phase and significantly decreased during further growth . expression of lsc in the hexr mutant showed a tendency of being higher than the wild type in the early and mid-logarithmic growth phase. interestingly, a significantly higher expression  of lsc was observed in the hexr mutant as compared to that of the wild type at an od <dig> of  <dig>  referring to late-logarithmic to stationary phase.figure  <dig>

abundance of lsc in pg <dig> wild type and hexr mutant
to qualitatively assess levan formation, pg <dig> wild type and its hexr mutant were grown on sucrose-containing mg agar plates resulting in indistinguishable levels of levan formation for both . the accumulation of lsc in extracellular fractions of the wild type and the hexr mutant of pg <dig> was tested using immunological detection. protein samples were obtained from cell-free culture supernatants of bacterial cultures grown with arabinose as sole carbon source to late exponential phase at 18°c. comparison of wild type and hexr mutant showed a slightly higher lsc accumulation in the mutant’s culture supernatant . these results further supported the hypothesis that hexr might repress lsc gene expression, resulting in more extra-cellular accumulation of its gene product in the hexr mutant.figure  <dig>

lack of an effect of hexr on protein secretion and hypersensitive response
to further investigate the decreased in planta fitness of the hexr mutant of p. syringae as compared to its wild type, hypersensitive response  assays were performed for both on the tobacco plant nicotiana tabacum . the resulting hr after  <dig> hours on leaves inoculated with the mutant was indistinguishable from that induced by the wild type. in addition, extra-cellular protein profiles were determined for pg <dig> wild type and its hexr mutant incubated in hrp gene-inducing im medium or in hs+ glucose medium . after electrophoretic separation of extra-cellular proteins, nearly identical proteins profiles were observed for pg <dig> wild type and its hexr mutant. in summary, these results indicated that a mutation of hexr does not influence the ability of p. syringae to induce an hr or alter its protein secretion pattern.figure  <dig>

discussion
this study revealed that expression of genes encoding for an extra-cellular protein appear to be co-regulated with genes required for central hexose metabolism in a gram-negative bacterium. complementing previous studies on the global hexose metabolism repressor, hexr, in p. putida  <cit> , our results suggested that involvement of hexr in regulation of lsc expression might be a selective adaptation of the plant pathogen, p. syringae, to its well-studied infection cycle  <cit> . once lsc is secreted, cellular resources needed for its synthesis such as amino acyl residues are not available for the cell anymore. consequently, p. syringae might repress lsc synthesis in coordination with hexose utilization when sufficient levels of intra-cellular glucose are available to balance the cell’s energy demands.

in close proximity and upstream of the translation start site  of p. syringae lsc genes, palindromic sequences were identified, which resemble hexr binding sites previously predicted for p. putida  <cit> . repressors such as hexr were suggested to bind to inverted repeats that partially or fully overlap rna-polymerase binding sites  <cit> .

sucrose is the most abundant plant storage sugar  <cit> . bacterial in planta and in vitro growth analyses indicated that the substrate of lsc, sucrose, and in consequence its enzymatic product, glucose, seem to be major nutrient sources for p. syringae during in planta growth. this is in line with previous findings reporting high molecular abundances of sucrose in bean plant’s apoplastic fluids  <cit> . consequently, expression and secretion of lsc might be a fitness factor for the in planta life of p. syringae. along the course of the experiment, the total populations of pg <dig> wild type and its hexr mutant varied but were not significantly different from each other. this variation reflects a feature that is usually observed during assessment of bacterial populations  <cit> . ll kinkel, m wilson and se lindow  <cit>  showed that two leaves of the same plant species might vary by over 10-fold in their total epiphytic bacteria. moreover, a study by ss hirano and cd upper  <cit>  also demonstrated that regardless of the geographic area, plant species, or time scale tested, variations in population sizes of p. syringae are common. many factors such as availability of nutrients, bacterial immigration  <cit> , and ability of bacteria to tolerate environmental stresses on leaf surfaces  <cit>  contribute to the observed variations.

a tendency is seen regarding the percentage of internalized bacteria in plants, although it is not significantly different. pg <dig> wild type shows higher percentage of internalized bacteria as opposed to those inoculated with the hexr mutant. on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post inoculation, the wild type had  <dig>   <dig> and 12% more internalized bacteria, respectively, than the hexr mutant. the high local abundance of sugars, mainly sucrose and glucose, in the apoplast of leave tissue  <cit>  could potentially be responsible for the weaker multiplication of the hexr mutant inside the plant tissue. consequently, it is hypothesized that hexr might play an important role in survival of pg <dig> inside soybean leaves. in turn, a higher percentage of external hexr mutant cells were surviving on the leaf surface although not significantly different . although our study did not provide direct evidence for this, an increase in levan formation by the hexr mutation might have protected the mutant from damage by uv light or desiccation leading to higher survival rates on the leaf surface.

finally, one may hypothesize that production of the levan exopolymer would rather be a ‘shunt’ product during the release of glucose from sucrose which, in turn, could be the actual major function of lsc in the sugar metabolic pathway . genes encoding lsc might be part of the hexr regulon of p. syringae in contrast to the situation in p. putida  <cit> , which is neither phytopathogenic nor harboring any lsc genes. however, other bacterial species, which possess similar enzymes for cleavage of sucrose to obtain readily usable glucose, could show a similar hexr-mediated regulation. therefore, it is suggestive to screen the most important oral cavity inhabiting bacterial species  <cit>  as well as bacteria, which cause mucus formation in sucrose-based food manufacturing  <cit>  or bio-fuel production  <cit>  for presence of this regulatory linkage.figure  <dig>

pg <dig>  enzymes shown in blocks are presumed to be repressed by hexr in p. putida  <cit>  or in p. syringae . lsc, levansucrase; glk, glucose kinase; zwf, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; pgl, 6-phosphogluconolactonase; edd, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase; eda, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase; gap, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase; tca, tricarboxylic acid cycle.



the use of arabinose as sole carbon source had no effect on the growth phenotype of the hexr mutant. this was not surprising since the assimilatory pathways of glucose and arabinose are independent. l-arabinose is converted to α–keto-glutarate in pseudomonas which can directly be utilized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle  independent of hexr regulation  <cit> .

currently, there is no plausible explanation for the lack of significant growth of the hexr mutant when supplemented with glucose or sucrose as sole carbon source. however, one might speculate on an up-regulation of genes normally repressed by hexr such as glk, zwf- <dig>  pgl, edd, eda, and gap- <dig> as previously shown in p. putida  <cit> . the effect could be potentiated in p. syringae by an increased expression of lsc, whose gene product in turn provides even more glucose. derepressed glucose consumption in the hexr mutant might cause a surplus production of nadph, nadh, and atp . in turn, this may lead to an imbalance of cellular redox homeostasis thus alleviating cellular ‘reductive stress’ or even inducing ‘energy spilling’, respectively.

in e. coli, the redox potential influences the synthesis of fermentation products, which are formed to recycle and reoxidize nadh  <cit> . when e. coli cells are aerobically challenged with high glucose concentrations, they undergo a so-called ‘acetate switch’, which decelerates growth  <cit> . a metabolic flux analysis of e. coli predicted that excess of carbon and energy might cause over-flow metabolism, which results in less efficient carbon utilization and decreased growth  <cit> . in streptococcus bovis, excess atp generation can cause ‘energy spilling’ by futile cycling of protons through the membrane, which leads to lesser biomass production  <cit> . whether reductive stress or ‘energy spilling’ take place in a glucose-exposed hexr mutant of p. syringae remains to be analyzed in future studies.

expression of lsc genes was higher in the hexr mutant as compared to the wild type during late logarithmic growth. this result is in accordance with previous results of micro-array analyses of glucose metabolic genes in p. putida kt <dig> where genes glk and zwf- <dig> showed a ~ two-fold increased expression while genes pgl, edd, eda, and gap- <dig> exhibited a four- to six-fold increased expression in a respective hexr mutant  <cit> . why lsc genes were only moderately up-regulated in the hexr mutant of p. syringae might be explained by the peripheral role of these genes in glucose metabolism.

the hr test is a classical assay to qualitatively show pathogenicity of a plant-associated microbe. the extracellular protein profiles and hr assay conducted with the wild type and the hexr mutant, respectively, suggested that hexr does not influence p. syringae’s ability to cause a hr on non-host plants. furthermore, our results suggested that the secretion of hrp-associated proteins was not affected when hexr was mutated. it is therefore tempting to speculate that the reduced ability of the hexr mutant to survive inside of the plant is not due to altered hrp gene expression but is rather due to a distorted sugar metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
data of this study prompt the question whether hexr-controlled genes such as edd, eda, glk, pgl, zwf- <dig>  or gap- <dig>  <cit>  are indeed co-regulated with lsc genes in p. syringae. the current study revealed exciting options for an in-depth analysis of intra-cellular and extra-cellular hexose metabolism in the plant pathogen p. syringae and may allow us to better understand the potentially complex interplay of factors and parameters contributing to epiphytic or pathogenic behavior of this organism, respectively.
