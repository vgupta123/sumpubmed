BACKGROUND
atlantic halibut is a cold-water flatfish native to the north atlantic that shows excellent potential for production in aquaculture due to its highly prized white flesh. flatfish have long been a choice food fish, with many members of the group e.g., halibuts, flounders, soles, turbot, and plaice, having great commercial value especially in asia. with the general worldwide decline in the wild fishery, and the predicted global collapse of all currently fished species by the year  <dig>  <cit> , it is crucial that alternatives such as aquaculture be pursued. investigations into producing flatfish by aquaculture have been underway for the last fifteen to twenty years. aquaculture production of japanese flounder, turbot, atlantic halibut and others has now been successfully achieved, although improvements in efficiency are still clearly required.

production of atlantic halibut is relatively recent and is currently underway in norway, iceland, scotland and canada. significant hurdles must still be overcome, particularly with regard to judging when to spawn females, reproduction and sex determination  <cit> , nutrition  <cit> , and enhancing disease resistance. the application of genomics technologies to thoroughly characterize the biological processes of reproduction, development, nutrition, and immunity promises to improve our knowledge of this poorly understood fish and provide for long-term enhancements in aquaculture production.

flatfish, members of the order pleuronectiformes, comprise a biologically interesting group of fish. during development, in a process known as metamorphosis, these fish reorient themselves to lie on one side, the body flattens, and the eye migrates to the other side of the body. this settling of the fish on the side vacated by the migrating eye requires a complex reorganization of skeletal, nervous and muscle tissues  <cit> . significant losses due to mortality in the early larval stages, as well as developmental abnormalities such as malpigmentation  <cit> , bone deformities  <cit> , and incomplete eye migration  <cit> , have hampered the successful production of flatfish. a better understanding of these processes at the molecular level and the impact that rearing conditions have on survival, metamorphosis, and growth will improve the commercial feasibility of flatfish aquaculture.

expressed sequence tag  surveys of species of interest provide a great deal of information-rich data on the expressed portion of an organism's genome  <cit>  and are invaluable in comparative genomics  <cit> . in addition, they can be an important source of microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms  that can be used for genetic mapping  <cit> . est surveys in teleosts have been performed from both non-normalised cdna libraries and libraries generated by suppression subtractive hybridisation  <cit>  in order to elucidate genes involved in immunity  <cit> , muscle formation  <cit> , endocrinology  <cit> , and toxin production  <cit> . the most highly represented teleost in dbest is the zebrafish, danio rerio, with over  <dig>  million ests. salmonids are also well-represented with over half a millions ests. economically important fish species such as catfish, cod, japanese flounder, sea bream and sea bass have increasingly been the subject of genomic studies and these species are now represented by several thousand or even tens of thousands of ests.

among the flatfish, considerable effort has been made to determine ests for japanese flounder  <cit> . there are currently  <dig> ests for this species, although most are unannotated. furthermore, the majority of these sequences arise from non-normalised cdna libraries or those constructed from immune-stimulated fish; few ests have been sequenced from non-immune tissues or different developmental stages of flatfish. for turbot, the other main commercially relevant flatfish, there are no published est studies and most of the sequences from this species in genbank are microsatellites or rrna.

as a first step towards developing genomics tools for atlantic halibut, a large-scale est survey was performed, annotations undertaken where possible, and a searchable database set up. considerable effort has been made to annotate these ests and associate them with gene ontology  terms to facilitate subsequent microarray analyses. the species-independent structured go vocabulary  <cit>  is widely accepted and used in most large scale genome annotation projects.

RESULTS
cdna libraries and ests
normalized cdna libraries were constructed from eight atlantic halibut tissues and five developmental stages. for all libraries, the percentage of clones with inserts was high, ranging from  <dig> to 98%, with average insert sizes between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb . after trimming and vector removal,  <dig> good sequences were obtained. average read length after trimming for each library was approximately 600– <dig> bp with the majority of reads compiled from all  <dig> libraries being between  <dig> and  <dig> bp . clustering of the sequences using paracel transcript assembler yielded  <dig> unique sequences , demonstrating the excellent normalization achieved by this approach. twenty-eight ests or est clusters, mostly from later larval stages, had matches to food organisms such as artemia and were removed from the database. the  <dig> remaining unique ests consisted of  <dig> unique clusters and  <dig> singletons. the normalization of the libraries precludes an accurate analysis of transcript abundance, although sequences present multiple times in the normalized libraries presumably correspond to high abundance transcripts. of the clones that were represented  <dig> times or more in a given library, the most common were a lectin-like protein, a  <dig> kda apolipoprotein, tropomyosin, parvalbumin, and apolipoprotein a <dig> . parvalbumin, lectin-like protein and the  <dig> kda apolipoprotein were each over-represented in two libraries.

the recombination efficiency represents the number of clones containing inserts. the number of clones sequenced, the average insert size in kb , and the number of clones represented more than once  for each library are presented.

genes that were represented more than five times in a given cdna library are listed.

screening of est sequences for short tandem repeats  identified  <dig> that contained microsatellite sequences. of these,  <dig> had  <dig> bp repeats ,  <dig> had  <dig> bp repeats,  <dig> had  <dig> bp repeats and  <dig> had  <dig> bp repeats. sixty of these loci were polymorphic and were incorporated into our halibut linkage map . all est data have been deposited in genbank , and preliminary annotations are available on the pleurogene website  <cit> .

annotation
all ests and clusters were initially annotated with autofact, which carries out a series of blast analyses to identify the est and attempts to assign function and/or pathway information. autofact provided product or gene names for  <dig> sequences  and  <dig> additional sequences had domain names associated with them . of the remaining sequences,  <dig> matched ribosomal rnas,  <dig> matched unassigned proteins,  <dig> matched unknown ests, and  <dig> had no database hits .

numbers of sequences associated with autofact classification. the method of classifying functionally annotated proteins is indicated and the numbers of categories identified by go, kegg and cog are given in brackets. go classifications were obtained using goblet and interpro information as well as autofact.

of the  <dig> functionally annotated and domain name-containing sequences, gene ontology  classifications were found for  <dig> using autofact, goblet and interpro. the distribution of sequences among go classifications are represented in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  sequences with go terms corresponding to cellular component fell into  <dig> categories , molecular function into  <dig> categories  and biological process into  <dig> categories . clusters of orthologous groups  categories were determined for  <dig> sequences, and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  categories were found for  <dig> sequences. sequences assigned to cog fell into  <dig> categories and those assigned to kegg fell into  <dig> pathways .

we also performed a similar analysis on the  <dig> partially annotated atlantic halibut sequences deposited in genbank by other groups. after assembly, a unigene set of  <dig> sequences was obtained of which  <dig> were rrna,  <dig> were unclassified,  <dig> matched unassigned proteins and  <dig> were informative annotations. however, of the informative annotations,  <dig> fell into five clusters: nuclease diphosphate kinase b , cytochrome c oxidase subunit iii , cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii , cytochrome c oxidase subunit i  and cytochrome b . similarly, of the  <dig> sequences that received cog annotations, over half  were associated with energy production and conversion, and were predominantly of mitochondrial origin.

when the complete est set of  <dig> sequences was searched for go terms using the goslim classification, two libraries were substantially more enriched in goslim terms than others: the ovary library had  <dig>  and the testis library had  <dig> hits to goslim terms, respectively. some of this enrichment can be explained by the increased number of ests sequenced from these libraries , but even taking this into account, there are still many more goslim terms in each of these libraries than the other tissue-specific libraries, which have between  <dig>  and  <dig>  terms. of the larval libraries, that from the mouth-opening stage had  <dig> hits to goslim terms. interestingly, the library constructed from larvae midway to metamorphosis had only  <dig> hits to goslim terms. the remainder of the libraries had between  <dig> and  <dig> goslim terms.

functional categories of cdnas
the functional categories included in the cog and go classification schemes are not entirely congruent and thus not directly comparable. broadly speaking, the cog classification gave a good overview of the cellular processes represented in the est library. as can be seen from table  <dig>  approximately one third of the ests are associated with a cog category related to transport, metabolism and energy, 44% of the ests are associated with nucleic acid processes, and 4% of the ests are associated with cell structure. the remainder of the classified ests represent genes involved in signal transduction, defense and intracellular trafficking. kegg annotations were found for  <dig> different sequences, the most common pathways represented are shown in table  <dig> 

categories were broadly grouped into metabolism and energy, nucleic acid processes and cell structure. the number  and percent  of ests in each category is shown.

categories with more than ten sequences out of a total of  <dig> are listed. the number  and percent  of ests in each category is shown.

discussion
to improve our understanding of flatfish biology and the problems associated with their development and rearing, a comparative genomics program focusing on atlantic halibut and senegal sole  has been initiated . as a prelude to construction of a dna microarray, the est survey reported here has been carried out.

two previous est surveys have been conducted in atlantic halibut: one from a study of the effect of vaccination  <cit> , resulting in approximately  <dig> sequences, and a second from an investigation of muscle somite formation  <cit> , resulting in approximately  <dig> sequences. the study reported here greatly enriches the genomic resources for this commercially important flatfish by adding more than  <dig>  ests to the partially annotated sequences that had already been deposited.

over  <dig> of the  <dig> unique transcripts represented by the ests have been functionally annotated. these annotations and the development of a searchable database containing all of the information associated with each est add enormous value to such a study. the main categories of genes represented in the ests are involved in binding, catalytic activity, transport, metabolism, response to stimuli, signal transduction, nucleic acid processes, and cellular biogenesis. again, this adds substantially to the atlantic halibut sequences from other research groups, many of which were of mitochondrial origin, and which contained slightly over  <dig> informative autofact annotations.

with only modest resources for est sequencing available, we choose to normalize our cdna libraries so as to maximize the number of different ests sequenced. the normalization method used  was very effective at reducing the number of highly expressed cdnas. since the libraries are well-normalised , it is not possible to gain insights into the actual abundance of different types of transcripts; however, the enrichment in go terms in the reproductive tissues and one of the larval libraries indicates that these libraries represent a broad diversity of transcripts, indicative of the high metabolic and proliferative characteristics of ovary and testis tissues. larvae at the early mouth-opening stage of development are also undergoing tremendous metabolic changes as they transition from the yolk-sac to first-feeding stages. on the other hand, the library made from larvae midway to metamorphosis has very few go terms associated with it, possibly because a large number of genes associated with the unusual metamorphic process in flatfish have not yet been described.

a number of ests were restricted to only a single tissue library and as such, may be good tissue-specific markers for in situ hybridisation and aid in tracking the appearance of different tissues during development  <cit> . for example, ests for a renal organic ion transporter and nephrosin are only found in the head kidney library. several transporters , binding proteins  as well as digestive enzymes  are only found in the intestine library. various complement components, apolipoproteins, fatty acid binding protein, alpha-2-macroglobulin and biliverdin reductase a are only present in the liver library. a single est unique to spleen was identified – metaxin  <dig>  similar to the von willebrand clotting factor. unique to the ovary library were a number of ests specific to reproduction – zona pellucida protein, vitelline envelope protein, chorion protein, choriolytic enzyme, aquaporin, alveolin, estrogen receptor binding protein and luteinizing hormone beta. similarly, the testis library uniquely contained ests specific to reproduction – spindlin protein c, testis intracellular mediator protein, a cysteine and glycine-rich protein, and periostin. the gill library uniquely contained two ests involved in chloride transport and the skin uniquely contained keratin, epithelial membrane protein- <dig>  epiplakin and dermatopontin.

the liver, head kidney and spleen libraries proved to be an excellent source of genetic information concerning hematopoiesis and immune function in this fish. the head kidney is the major site of hematopoiesis in fish and an est survey of zebrafish kidney revealed many insights into this process in fish  <cit> . from our atlantic halibut est survey, many complement components, immune type receptors, lectins, defense proteins, mhc i and ii components, cytokines, chemokines as well as signal transduction molecules and transcription factors involved in expression of immune genes were identified. it should be noted that ests for components of the immune system were also found in other tissue libraries, particularly those exposed to the environment such as skin and gill; these arose from circulating or resident immune cells in these tissues. this new sequence information will greatly enhance our understanding of the immune system of flatfish and provide molecular tools for further studying disease resistance.

the identification of microsatellite sequences in the atlantic halibut ests will aid in the completion of a genetic linkage map of atlantic halibut that is currently being constructed. since these microsatellites are linked to genes, they are useful as type i markers.

CONCLUSIONS
the addition of over  <dig> ests, of which  <dig> are functionally annotated, significantly enhances the genomic tools available for non-model fish species. given the high degree of sequence similarity between flatfish species, the atlantic halibut ests will be of great interest to the flatfish researchers in general, as well as the halibut aquaculture research community. the publicly accessible, searchable database also adds substantial value to the genomic data generated in this study. this est survey has provided a number of microsatellite markers that have been placed on the atlantic halibut genetic linkage map  as well as probes for cellular localisation studies by in situ hybridisation. it has also laid the groundwork for the design and construction of a microarray for studying gene expression under different environmental conditions to better understand the impact of nutrition, stress, and environmental conditions on aquaculture production.
