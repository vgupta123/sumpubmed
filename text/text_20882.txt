BACKGROUND
stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide  <cit> . although significant efforts have been devoted to understand the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia, very few therapeutic options are available  <cit> . among the deleterious events following occlusion of a blood vessel in the brain, excitotoxicity and alteration of intraneuronal ca2+ homeostasis are considered early processes that propagate the cascade of harmful events leading to cerebral infarction  <cit> . the primary ischemic episode results in neuroinflammation, which leads to increase in tissue destruction through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines , enhanced metabolism of arachidonic acid, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and edema  <cit> .

recently, there has been much interest in the potential neuroprotective efficacy of 5-hydroxytryptamine  receptor subtype  <dig>  antagonists  <cit> . blockade of 5-ht <dig> receptor with mdl <dig> and y- <dig> reduced glutamate release, elevation of cytosolic ca2+ concentration, oxidative damage, and apoptotic neuronal cell death induced by either hydrogen peroxide or β-amyloid peptide  <cit> . furthermore, an earlier study by kagami-ishi and colleagues demonstrated that the 5-ht <dig> antagonist y- <dig> conferred protection against ischemia-induced decrease in ca <dig> field potential in rat hippocampal slices  <cit> .

in the light of all this previous evidence, the present investigation was conducted to assess whether treatment with the 5-ht <dig> antagonist tropisetron would show neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic injury. since most cases of human ischemic stroke are caused by irreversible occlusion of major cerebral arteries  <cit> , we utilized a well-standardized model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery  in the rat.

RESULTS
effect of tropisetron on infarct volume following permanent focal cerebral ischemia in the rat
using the intraluminal filament technique, we had previously found that infarct size reached its maximal values at  <dig> h after pmcao  <cit> . for this reason, in the present investigation animals were studied at  <dig> h after the onset of stroke. all animals studied had large infarct areas in the mca territory, involving both cortical and subcortical structures, as revealed by the lack of ttc staining in these regions . pretreatment with two different doses of the 5-ht <dig> antagonist, tropisetron, failed to reduce the total infarct volume, as shown in fig. 1b. to exclude the possibility of a region-specific outcome, we next investigated the effect of tropisetron on the infarct volume in cortical and subcortical regions. again, tropisetron did not significantly modify the size of the infarct in this animal model of stroke . similarly, we studied the rostrocaudal distribution of areas of cortical and subcortical infarction at six coronal levels in tropisetron- and vehicle-treated rats. no effect of tropisetron was observed at any level of the brain infarct . furthermore, among treatment groups, there were no statistically significant differences in the edema index .

ischemic animals receiving tropisetron showed increased neurological deficits and mortality
animals given tropisetron displayed a significant increase in the neurological deficits at  <dig> h after pmcao. although administration of  <dig> mg/kg of tropisetron did not significantly modify neurological scores, treatment of rats with  <dig> mg/kg of tropisetron  <dig> min before pmcao produced a significant deterioration of the neurological status in these animals . furthermore, in animals receiving the highest dose of tropisetron, there was a significant  increase to  <dig> %  in the mortality rate compared to vehicle-treated animals , as shown in fig. 2b. there was a trend towards an increase in mortality in rats receiving  <dig> mg/kg of tropisetron, but this effect did not reach statistical significance .

discussion
present data do not support the notion that blockade of 5-ht <dig> receptors reduces ischemic brain injury induced by focal cerebral ischemia. on the contrary, our findings clearly showed that treatment with tropisetron worsened neurological recovery and increased mortality of ischemic animals. no previous investigations have been published on the effects of the 5-ht <dig> antagonist tropisetron on neuronal damage induced by focal cerebral ischemia. thus, these in vivo data could have important implications for the potential use of 5-ht <dig> antagonists in neuroprotection, as other investigators have suggested  <cit> . most 'negative' results in preclinical studies in cerebral ischemia are not even submitted for publication. this practice goes against the stair  recommendations that data, both positive and negative, should be published  <cit> .

previous studies evaluating the neuroprotective efficacy of 5-ht <dig> antagonists utilized in vitro cultures of neurons and hippocampal slices subjected to ischemia-like conditions. those findings indicated that blockade of 5-ht <dig> receptors might confer significant neuroprotection by reducing glutamate release, free radicals formation, and maintenance of ca2+ homeostasis  <cit> .

it is well established that the activation of 5-ht <dig> receptors is followed by rapid depolarization causing rapid rise in cytosolic ca2+ levels by inducing influx of ca2+ and mobilization of intracellular ca2+ stores  <cit> . these processes modulate the release of various neurotransmitters including dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine, gaba and 5-ht itself  <cit> .

we had previously shown that tropisetron potently inhibits lipopolysaccharide-mediated production of tnf-α and il-1β in human monocytes, as well as 5-ht-induced prostaglandin e <dig>  release from synovial cells  <cit> . in addition, we found that tropisetron inhibited dna binding and transcriptional activity of nfat, ap- <dig> and nf-κb in t cells exposed to pro-inflammatory stimuli  <cit> . furthermore, very recent data from our lab indicate that the 5-ht <dig> antagonists, tropisetron, ondansetron and dolansetron, significantly reduce pge <dig> release and 8-isoprostane formation  in neuronal cells exposed to il-1β .

based on this promising evidence coming from in vitro studies, one might expect that blockade of 5-ht <dig> receptors to be beneficial in cerebral ischemia. however, results from this investigation not only demonstrate that treatment with tropisetron failed to diminish brain infarction, but also showed that neurological deficits and mortality rate were dramatically increased in ischemic animals given this 5-ht <dig> antagonist. at present, the molecular mechanisms underlying these detrimental effects of tropisetron are far from clear. in addition, it is not yet known whether other 5-ht <dig> antagonists share these stroke-worsening properties of tropisetron.

one possible explanation for these detrimental effects of tropisetron might be the ability of 5-ht <dig> antagonists to significantly reduce gabaergic neurotransmission  <cit> . this notion is based on evidence showing that ca2+ influx through presynaptic 5-ht <dig> receptors facilitates gaba release in several brain regions  <cit> . cerebral ischemia produces a dramatic increase in gaba release, which is thought to be an important compensatory mechanism against ischemia  <cit> . activation of gaba receptors potently reduces ischemic and excitotoxic brain injury  <cit> . thus, blockade of 5-ht <dig> receptors with tropisetron could potentially hamper this protective mechanism involving ischemia-mediated gaba release. however, this possibility should be confirmed experimentally in a model of ischemic stroke.

antagonists of 5-ht <dig> receptors, including tropisetron, are clinically used for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting , and for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis. these drugs selectively and competitively bind to 5-ht <dig> receptors, blocking serotonin binding at vagal afferents in the gut and in the regions of the central nervous system involved in emesis, including the chemoreceptor trigger zone and the nucleus tractus solitarii  <cit> .

it is difficult to ascertain whether the doses of tropisetron used here in the rat are comparable to the dosage used in humans. a direct interspecies dose extrapolation is usually inaccurate due to changes in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacological behavior of the drug in different species  <cit> . this is further complicated by the fact that some 5-ht <dig> antagonists, including tropisetron, show a bell-shaped dose-response curve  <cit> , leaving open the possibility that lower doses of tropisetron might have complete different effects in permanent ischemic stroke.

significant increase in neurological deficits and mortality was found in animals receiving tropisetron. however, no parallel increase in infarct size was observed in any of the groups treated with tropisetron when compared to rats given the vehicle. there is not always a direct correlation between the lesion size and the severity of neurological deficits as demonstrated before in animal models  <cit>  and in stroke patients  <cit> . this indicates that the severity of disability is not predicted well by the amount of brain tissue lost.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study showed that the 5-ht <dig> antagonist tropisetron failed to reduce cerebral infarction induced by pmcao in the rat, and produced a significant increase in neurological deficits and mortality rate. whichever the mechanism responsible for the detrimental effects of tropisetron in cerebral ischemia, present study could have important clinical implications. patients taking tropisetron, and possibly other 5-ht <dig> antagonists, might have a worse prognosis following a cerebral ischemic event.
