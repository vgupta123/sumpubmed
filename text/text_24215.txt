BACKGROUND
the biologically active products synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases  are of interest for a variety of reasons: pharmaceutically, a rich collection of them are used as drugs like antibiotics , anti-tumorals and cytostatics , anti-inflamatorials and immunosuppressants , toxins ), or siderophores. scientifically, it is a challenge to discover how these structurally complex macromolecules are synthesized by the concerted interworking of the multi-domain proteins nrps and polyketide synthases  that synthesize a peptide or ketide backbone with several other modifying and "decorating" enzymes . nrps belong to the family of megasynthetases, which are among the largest known enzymes with molecular weights of up to ~ <dig>  mda   <cit> . they possess several modules, each of which contains a set of enzymatic domains that, in their specificity, number, and organization, determine the primary structure of the corresponding peptide products; for a recent review on nrps, see sieber and marahiel  <cit> , and lautru and challis  <cit> . a complete module contains at least three enzymatic domains .

the adenylation  domain specifically recognizes one amino acid  and activates it first through the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate and then via covalent bonding of the activated amino acid as a thioester to the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl  cofactor of the peptidyl carrier protein  domain). the third compulsory domain is the condensation  domain, which catalyzes the elongation reaction of the peptidyl chain tethered to the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the upstream t domain to the amino acid bound to the downstream t domain . this is why the first module of an nrps usually does not contain a c domain, but only the second module has the domains cat. the exceptions are c domains, which we name starter c domains; these acylate the first amino acid with a fatty acid . chain elongation is terminated by the action of a thioesterase  domain. it is usually the final domain of the last module in the assembly line and catalyzes either the hydrolysis or the intramolecular cyclization of the peptide chain, yielding a linear or macrocyclic product  <cit> . although the multi-domain proteins nrps and pks are also found in fungal and plant genomes, most of the known sequences stem from bacteria. the bacterial order actinomycetales is known for the wealth of secondary metabolites produced by its members and comprises, among others, streptomyces species, corynebacteria and mycobacteria. the majority of all currently known antibiotics and other therapeutic compounds are derived from streptomycetes  <cit> . many members of corynebacteria and mycobacteria are human pathogens which produce toxins as secondary metabolites. the structural and functional diversity of non-ribosomal peptides, unlike ribosomally synthesized peptides, arises from the incorporation of unusual amino acids: during the assembly of the peptide backbone by the nrps, both proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids , including d-amino acids, may be integrated and modified "on-the-fly" by enzymatic domains within the nrps protein. possible  modifications of the building blocks  are n-acylation of the first amino acid, epimerization , n-methylation, or cyclization of amino acids  with an amide-nitrogen of the peptide "backbone", resulting in oxazolines  and thiazolines ; these can be further oxidized or reduced by special domains  <cit> , and further halogenation or hydroxylation may be mediated by specialized domains. occasionally dehydration is performed on serines, resulting in dehydroalanine  <cit> . further modifications – glycosylation or phosphorylation – are usually performed by so-called "decorating" enzymes, usually clustered in proximity to the nrps genes on the chromosome  <cit> .

in this paper, we report on the functional variants  and homologues of the condensation  domain of nrps. all c domain sequences of this study were extracted from nrps that were detected in all available completely sequenced bacterial genomes and a comprehensive collection of annotated biosynthesis clusters. besides a domains  c domains also show specificity for their substrates . an in-depth understanding of their function is thus crucial for re-engineering nrps to produce novel bioactive compounds. in practice, it has been shown that it is possible to engineer synthetic systems for the production of novel products: stachelhaus et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that domain swapping, which is the recombination of domain-coding regions of desired specificity to a synthetic fusion protein, worked to create new variants of surfactin and is thus one possibility, although only one amino acid position in the product was varied, which did not alter its activity, and the total yield was very low .

because c domains have been shown to have non-negligible specificity for the amino acid that is activated by the downstream a domain, swapping whole modules or insertion/deletion seems to be more promising, provided that the integrity of the functional domains is carefully maintained and the modules are dissected in their linker regions  <cit> . nevertheless, reduced catalytic efficiency and product yield is a serious problem. a less invasive strategy involves the manipulation of the domains' specificity by point mutations as demonstrated by eppelmann et al.  <cit>  for the a domain. therefore, an in-depth knowledge of all functional subtypes and homologues of the c domains is indispensable. in this report, we reconstruct their phylogeny and reveal the sequence motifs of all subtypes and homologues, and their mutual differences. the insights gained will be helpful in future attempts to turn one sub-specificity into another, e.g. changing the stereoselectivity of the c domain.

furthermore, we have analyzed c domains and epimerization  domains of glycopeptide nrps. in these proteins, two condensation domains preceded by former  epimerization domains have gained opposite stereoselectivity, probably due to convergent evolution, for which we accumulate evidence. additionally, we discuss the origin of a c domain  at the c-terminus of glycopeptide nrps, which is thought to be inactive.

RESULTS
current knowledge of subtypes lcl, dcl, cyc, and dual e/c
the c domain has two binding sites: one for the electrophilic donor substrate  and one for the nucleophilic acceptor substrate . the condensation reaction involves catalysis of a nucleophilic attack by the amino group of the aminoacyl adenylate bound to the downstream pcp on the acyl group of the growing peptide chain which is bound to the upstream pcp  <cit> . the acceptor site of the c domain was shown to exhibit a strong stereoselectivity and significant side chain selectivity. the selectivity towards a specific side chain seems to be less pronounced at the donor site which, however, exhibits strong stereoselectivity  <cit> .

in particular, c domains succeeding an e domain are expected to show specificity towards the configuration  of the c-terminal residue that is bound at the donor site because the preceding e domain does not specifically catalyze the epimerization from l to d but provides a mixture of configurations. it is the role of the c domain to select the correct enantiomer  <cit> . moreover, the c domain represents some kind of selectivity filter in that it supports the selection of the correct downstream nucleophile and prevents product mixtures  <cit> .

c domains immediately downstream of e domains were shown to be d-specific for the upstream donor and l-specific for the downstream acceptor, thus catalyzing the condensation reaction between a d- and an l-residue. these c domains were termed dcl-catalysts because of this behavior  <cit> .

accordingly, lcl-catalysts promote the condensation of two l-amino acids. both lcl- and dcl-catalysts possess a conserved his-motif in their active site. the consensus sequence of this motif is hhxxxdg where x denotes any residue . the second his-residue seems to be essential for the catalytic function of the domain  <cit> .

as a third type of c domain, so-called dual epimerization/condensation  domains have recently been identified. this finding was based on the observation of nrps which had products that contained d-residues although the nrps itself did not show an e domain in the corresponding module. biochemical experiments supported the hypothesis that dual e/c domains exist which are dcl-catalysts with epimerase activity  <cit> . in the assembly line, a dual e/c domain follows directly after a c-a-t module which activates and incorporates an l-amino acid. the module which contains the dual domain also activates an l-amino acid. then the dual domain catalyzes the epimerization of the l-residue into d configuration and subsequently promotes the condensation of those two residues. in addition to the active site his-motif which is found in all c domains, dual e/c domains exhibit a second his-motif, hhxxxxgd, which is located close to the n-terminus of the domain  <cit>  

c domains may be replaced by heterocyclization  domains which catalyze both peptide bond formation and subsequent cyclization of cysteine , serine , and threonine  residues. the five-membered heterocyclic rings which result from this reaction are important for chelating metals or interaction with proteins, dna or rna. cyc domains are structurally related to c domains and are supposed to be evolutionary specialized c domains  <cit> . in cyc domains, however, the active site his motif is replaced by another conserved motif, dxxxxd. keating et al.  <cit>  found that the aspartate  residues are critical for both condensation and heterocyclization.

collected c domain sequence data and their phylogenetic tree
a total of  <dig> condensation domains  were extracted from  <dig>  nrps and  <dig> nrps/pks hybrid sequences found in  <dig> bacterial genomes out of the  <dig> bacterial genomes screened, employing phmms as described in section methods . altogether  <dig> c domains were obtained from  <dig> nrps sequences from gene clusters downloaded from the uniprot database. after removing doublets, all  <dig> non-identical c domains and homologues obtained were multiply aligned and phylogenetic trees were built. the resulting tree topology was clearly dominated by the functional categories that are known for c domains , rather than species phylogeny or substrate specificity alone. the four main functions are:  <dig>  condensation performed by ordinary c domains;  <dig>  condensation and subsequent heterocyclization catalyzed by heterocyclization  domains;  <dig>  epimerization followed by condensation which are both catalyzed by a dual e/c domain;  <dig>  starter domains  which are found on initiation  modules and acylate the subsequent amino acid.

ordinary c domains may further be classified into lcl-catalysts and dcl-catalysts according to the stereochemistry of their substrates. the existence of all these functional subtypes is reflected by the phylogeny. fig.  <dig> shows a phylogenetic tree for subsets of each c domain subtype, as the whole tree of  <dig> taxa is far too large to be displayed here . the tree of all taxa showed a similar topology perfectly reflecting the functional categories.

for further analysis, the different subtypes were examined separately. while cyc and dual e/c domains could be identified by means of their characteristic sequence motifs , lcl- and dcl-catalysts were either distinguished according to their domain structure or by their position in the phylogenetic tree. by this,  <dig> domains of all  <dig> c domains were classified as being lcl-catalysts,  <dig> were dcl-catalysts and  <dig> were starter c domains .

description of a new c domain subtype: the starter c domain
when analyzing the condensation  domain phylogeny, it became apparent that some domains did not cluster with the known c domain subtypes. a closer look at the location of these deviating c domains revealed that all of them were the very first c domain of the corresponding nrps assembly line. the remaining c domains of these assembly lines appeared in other subtrees in the phylogeny.

included in this set of starter c domains are those stemming from the biosynthesis clusters for the lipopeptides surfactin  <cit> , lichenysin  <cit> , fengycin  <cit>  and arthrofactin  <cit> . these lipopeptides are characterized by a β-hydroxyl fatty acid which is connected to the first amino acid of the peptide chain  <cit> . the peptide synthetases involved in the production of these lipopeptides all have a c domain as their very first domain. this c domain is supposed to serve as an acceptor for a fatty acid which is transferred from an acyltransferase  <cit> . this acylation process has also been observed for surfactin  <cit>  and fengycin biosynthesis  <cit> . moreover, common to the starter c domains of these biosynthesis clusters is their low sequence similarity to the remaining c domains of the same biosynthesis cluster  <cit> .

the same has been observed for the synthesis of the acidic lipopeptide cda in streptomyces coelicolor  <cit>  and the recently identified lipopeptide produced by protein np_ <dig>  of mycobacterium avium  <cit> . the starter c domain of the pristinamycin cluster appears to diverge from this pattern at the first view. the c domain is the first domain of the polypeptide snbc but the biosynthesis of pristinamycin is initiated by snba, which contains an a domain that activates 3-hydroxypicolinic acid  but lacks an acp  <cit> . snba is homologous to ente, which contains an a domain specific for  <dig> -dihydroxybenzoate  and which is involved in the biosynthesis of enterobactin  <cit> . a similar organization can be found in actinomycin biosynthesis. the process is initiated by acma, which activates 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid   <cit> . in conclusion, what the c domains of snbc, acmb and entf have in common is that they catalyze bond formation between a derivative of salicylic acid  and an α-amino acid. assured by the fact that these starter c domains match significantly well to the profile hmm built from the starter c domain sequences that process β-hydroxy fatty acids, we compared salicylic acid with β-hydroxy fatty acids. because both are β-hydroxy-carboxylic acids with no amino-substituent at the α position, as a-amino acids would have, we assume that this is the structural characteristic recognized by the prototype of starter c domains. the profile hmm built from all starter c domains in our data set  presents a powerful instrument for exploring and understanding tricky nrps domain-product relations.

note that formylation domains as found, for example at the n-terminus of linear gramicidin synthetase subunit a  <cit>  are not c domains but belong to the pfam "formyl transferase" domain family.

characteristic sequence motifs of lcl, dcl, starter c domains and dual e/c domains
the different core motifs in condensation domains have first been described by de crécy-lagard et al.  <cit>  and recompiled by marahiel et al.  <cit>  but have never been updated since then. the core motifs of the c domain homologues, epimerization and heterocyclization domain are listed in the publication by marahiel et al.  <cit>  but the sequence motifs of the recently discovered dcl domains  <cit>  as well as the dual e/c  <cit>  domains have never been comprehensively analyzed. moreover the starter c domain has not yet been recognized in the literature as a proper separate subtype.

the sequence motifs represented in fig.  <dig> improve the c domain core motif consensus sequences published by marahiel et al.  <cit>  which, at that time, were based on much fewer sequences and did not differentiate between the c domain subtypes. the motifs are represented as sequence logos  <cit>  which make it easier to identify variably conserved positions compared to simple consensus sequences. we adhere to the core motifs identified by marahiel et al.  <cit> , and also show the surrounding "landscape" if there are highly conserved positions nearby, especially if they are important for distinguishing between the c domain subtypes. the motifs were built on the basis of  <dig> verified and  <dig> predicted lcl sequences, in which "predicted" means that they were classified based purely on their position in the phylogenetic tree while "verified" sequences were checked individually taking into account their position in the succession of neighboring nrps domains, the presence of discriminative unique motifs  and/or literature information. for the dcl motifs,  <dig> verified and  <dig> predicted sequences were used,  <dig> verified and  <dig> predicted for the starter domains, and domains  <dig> verified and  <dig> predicted for the dual e/c domains.

key residues in condensation domains derived from the literature
based on three publications, four residues are likely to be essential for the catalytic activity of the c domain. the most important residue is the 2nd his of the active site his-motif  <cit> .

furthermore, six residues have been identified as being structurally important or as playing a role in correct folding of the domain. in the following, these residues are presented, grouped by their role . this information is also presented in table  <dig> where the sites are sorted by their relative position in the domain.

lcl vs. dcl
lcl and dcl domains do not differ significantly in any of the residues identified as being of catalytic or structural importance . however, using methods described in section methods,  <dig> positions in which lcl and dcl have significant differences according to sdppred  <cit>  could be detected, plus  <dig> additional high scoring positions within the extended motifs according to frpred  <cit> . when comparing the different motifs, motif c <dig> differs noticeably between lcl and dcl subtypes. the same is true for the region downstream of c <dig>  where a moderately conserved motif lpxdxxrp is seen in lcl which is completely absent in dcl .

lcl vs. starter domain
while not being conserved at residues nb.  <dig>  nb.  <dig>  nb.  <dig>  and nb.  <dig>  all remaining  <dig> functionally important residues are highly conserved throughout the putative starter domains. when comparing lcl and starter domains,  <dig> discriminative positions were found by sdppred and  <dig> more were found in the motifs by frpred. those positions are highlighted in fig.  <dig>  common to these residues is the fact that they seem to be highly conserved among extender  domains but show no conservation among starter c domains. when we compare c domain sequence motifs, it is apparent that motifs c <dig> and c <dig>  despite being well conserved in lcl, are unconserved in starter domains, which presumably can be explained by the much broader structural range of substrates processed by starter domains.

what the phylogeny tells about the relationship of lcl vs. starter and dcl vs. dual e/c domains
the reconstructed phylogeny of c domain subtypes reveals that lcl and starter c domains are more closely related to each other than to other subtypes . comparing sequence motifs confirms this observation, though pronounced differences in some segments of the protein  account for the unequal donor substrates . furthermore the phylogenetic tree shows that dual e/c and dcl domains share a common ancestor. we tested the reliability of the phylogenies depicted in fig.  <dig> and fig.  <dig> by repeating the reconstruction on biased profile alignments. these biased alignments were generated by producing muscle profile-profile alignments in a step-wise manner, assuming evolutionary relationships of the different domain subtypes that are contradictory to what the original trees suggest. the topology of the resulting trees supports the shared ancestry of lcl and starter c domains as well as of dual e/c and dcl domains. in addition, we generated an alignment using dialign  <cit> , which is a non-progressive alignment method, and subsequently reconstructed a phyml-tree based on this alignment. here also, the dual e/c and dcl domains are grouped together as are lcl and starter c domains.

especially in motif c <dig>  dual e/c and dcl domains are very similar to each other and dissimilar to lcl and starter domains. this observation of the relationship between the four subtypes is consistent with the stereochemistry of the substrates, bearing in mind that dual e/c domains function as dcl because the substrate l-amino acid is first epimerized by the intrinsic epimerization activity of the domain  <cit> .

within the subtrees of dcl and lcl domains, the tree topology reflects the species phylogeny of the bacteria rather than substrate specificity of any kind. we analyzed this by reconstructing phylogenies for dcl domains and lcl domains separately to be able to see the topology within these subtypes in more detail . the reconstructed phylogenies did not give any evidence that would support the hypothesis that c domains cluster according to their specificity towards the condensated amino acids. this analysis, however, is based on the complete c domain sequence. a strategy to investigate whether c domains exhibit substrate specificity would involve predicting putative specificity determining positions using entropy and/or conservation based approaches , or inferring of putative active site residues by homology with the vibh structure .

enigmatic glycopeptide antibiotic nrps
glycopeptide antibiotics are a subgroup of nonribosomal peptide antibiotics of which the best known representatives are probably vancomycin and teicoplanin. to date, all identified glycopeptide antibiotics are produced by actinomycetes. they interrupt cell wall formation of gram-positive bacteria by binding to the d-ala-d-ala termini of the growing peptidoglycan, thereby inhibiting the transpeptidation reaction. all glycopeptide antibiotics consist of a heptapeptide backbone which is synthesized by nrps.

modification reactions involve extensive cross-linking of the aromatic side chains to rigidify the molecule  <cit> . the modular organization of some nrps which were identified in glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes are depicted in fig.  <dig> 

all these nrpss comprise seven modules. they show an identical domain composition, with the exceptions of module m <dig> in the a <dig>  and m <dig> and m <dig> in complestatin  clusters which contain an e domain not present in the other clusters. the m3-e domain, however, is assumed to be inactive  <cit> , while the presence of an e domain in com m <dig> has not been reported elsewhere so far. we were able to detect it with an hmmpfam scan using the specific e domain phmm. all six nrpss contain a domain x* of unknown function. until now, it has been characterized as an atypical c or e domain but its role in glycopeptide synthesis remains to be clarified. in general, it is assumed that the stereochemistry of a nrps product can be predicted from its domain structure. in the case of the known glycopeptides, the domain organization implies the stereochemistry nh2-l-d-l-d-d-l-l-cooh, provided that the e in module m <dig> is inactive and that the x* domain does not function as an e domain. this stereochemistry is inconsistent with the chemically determined structure of the products: nh2-d-d-l-d-d-l-l-cooh  <cit> . the assumption is that the a domain of the first module activates a d-amino acid. for the cep cluster, however, trauger and walsh  <cit>  show that the a domain of m <dig> prefers l-leu over d-leu in a 6: <dig> ratio; but on the other hand, they could not show which stereoisomer is processed further. this suggests the existence of an unknown e domain that acts on the l-leu activated by m <dig>  with the discovery of dual e/c domains, a new possible strategy arises for the incorporation of a d-residue by the first module. however, no dual e/c domain could be detected in all glyco-nrps. alternatively, one could imagine an external racemase as is found in the cyclosporin cluster  <cit> , which provides a d-leu that can be incorporated directly.

having gained knowledge about the differences between lcl, starter and dcl domains as described above, we examined all glyco-nrpss. when we reconstructed the phylogeny of c domains including all homologous domains from glyco-nrpss, it was staggering to find that all c domains were clustered in the dcl subtree and the x* domain clustered in the lcl subtree . this finding could be confirmed by analyzing all instances of the c domain motifs found in these domains. how could this be interpreted, given the fact that m <dig> and m <dig> c domains clearly act as lcl domains, as we can tell by the stereochemistry of the products? our hypothesis is that those c domains are former dcl domains that have developed lcl activity by convergent evolution. accumulating supportive evidence is possible: when we look at the phylogeny of the c domains, the sequences of the com cluster from streptomyces lavendulae are always most distant from the others and more closely related to the hypothetical common ancestor, implying that they can serve as a model for the archetype of glyco-c domains. it is likely that in the archetype, all c domains were true dcl catalysts, supposing that the e domains which are still present in com modules m <dig> and m <dig> were still active.

in a similar way, we can trace back the origin of the x* domain: in the com cluster  it is followed by remnants of an adenylation domain . this tells us that the x* domain used to be the first domain of a new module followed by an adenylation domain.

the assumption that the diverged c domains of modules m <dig> and m <dig> would have adopted mutations at positions that we have previously determined as "specificity determining positions" was disproved. probably, a few spontaneous mutations in the dcl domains relaxed the stereo-selectivity; supposing that this altered stereochemistry of the product resulted in a highly selective advantage , the loss of the functional e domains in m <dig> and m <dig> would have been a selective gain. comparing all m <dig> and/or all m <dig> c domains with all dcl domains using sdppred did not reveal any significant positions; comparing them against the other glyco-c domains gave thirty positions. as all glyco-c domains are very closely related and differences between them might also reflect substrate selectivity  or different inter-domain interacting residues, we cannot decide which of them confer the altered stereo-selectivity. one point to notice however, is a  his in all m <dig> glyco-c domains at position  <dig> in the extended motif c <dig> where an  gln is highly conserved in other dcl domains. this position has also been selected by frpred as a significant  position. the other positions do not represent mutations in highly conserved residues . it would be necessary to check their significance experimentally with mutation studies. it would also be helpful to compare the peculiar sequences with more glyco-c domains, but others are -unfortunately – not publicly available.

however, although we could not discover which altered positions are responsible for the functional shift from dcl to lcl in glyco-c domains, interesting experimental questions can be formulated based on our findings. for example, one could think of mutational studies with the goal of altering the stereo-selectivity of a dcl domain and to determine the relevant residues experimentally. a starting point could be, for example the m <dig> c domain of any glyco-nrps.

glycopeptide-ab module m <dig> vs lcl
the second his of the his-motif in motif c <dig> which is important for catalysis is replaced by arg . also, the gly of the his-motif is not present but replaced by arg in all but one x* domain. note, however, that while the second active site his is invariant in c domains, gly <dig> is not.

sdppred predicted  <dig> specificity determining residues when comparing m7-x* to lcl-domains of streptomyces species. only three of these coincide with residues of functional importance: his <dig>  arg <dig> and asn <dig>  furthermore, a c terminal region could be detected in which m7-x* and lcl differ strikingly. the concordance of m7-x* with the most highly conserved residues of streptomycete lcl domains supports the phylogenetically based suggestion that m7-x* is an inactive lcl domain.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present the evolutionary relationship of homologues of the nrps condensation domain which include enzymatic domains catalyzing epimerization, heterocyclization, condensation and epimerization with subsequent condensation in one domain . the condensation domain itself appears in three subtypes according to the stereo-chemistry of the substrates catalyzed: lcl domains, which condense two l-aminoacids, dcl domains, which condense a d-amino acid  with an l-amino acid, and starter c domains  which connect a β-hydroxy-carboxylic acid  with an l-amino acid. the phylogeny of c domain homologues is reconstructed using nrps sequences  from completely sequenced genomes  and selected biosynthesis clusters, involving  <dig> non-identical c domain sequences. the sequence motifs of lcl, dcl and starter domains have been extracted and are presented as sequence logos: for lcl domains, this represents an update of consensus sequences published by marahiel et al.  <cit> ; dcl and starter domain motifs are analyzed and mutually compared for the first time. for comparison, the homologous motifs are also presented for dual e/c domains, which were first described by balibar et al.  <cit> .

we have investigated the "mysterious" evolutionary origin of c domains in glycopeptide antibiotic synthesis clusters and have discovered that two of the six c domains present in these glyco-nrpss appear in the dcl subtree of the phylogenetic tree and show all dcl sequence motifs, although they clearly have lcl activity. this suggests that they might be an example of convergent evolution. even though this is probably a rare event, its possibility has to be kept in mind when uncharacterized c domains are to be classified, e.g. using profile hmms provided as additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  furthermore, we found that a c domain-like segment of glyco-nrps, called x*, is related to the lcl domains and is followed by remnants of an a domain, implying an additional complete module in the ancestor of glyco-nrps.

roongsawang et al.  <cit>  have already performed a study of the phylogeny of c domains which compares the three c domain subtypes. however, this study shows no awareness of the dual e/c domain, which has since been discovered. moreover, we used a much more comprehensive dataset of c domain subsequences  compiled from all complete bacterial genomes and biosynthesis clusters. because of the omission of dual e/c domains, their conclusions need to be revised, as we have shown.
