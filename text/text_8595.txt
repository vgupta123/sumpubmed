BACKGROUND
pseudoviruses  are synthetic viruses that can include genetic material such as dna and rna, and are closely related to the structures and characteristics of its native viruses, but lack characteristics shown in the authentic viruses such as capability for replication  <cit> . psv systems permit the continuous production of virus particles mimicking naturally occurring particles, and provide high-throughput systems for evaluating anti-viral agents and vaccine candidates. recently, various types of psv systems have been developed. the psv system for human immunodeficiency virus  uses the tzm-bi cell line, a genetically modified hela cell line expressing receptors for hiv and the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the hiv long-terminal repeat  <cit> . psvs for merkel cell polyoma virus  have been generated by co-transfection with the vp <dig> and vp <dig> genes of mcv strain  <dig> and a green fluorescent protein  reporter plasmid of 293tt cells engineered to stably express the cdna of simian virus  <dig>  t antigen  <cit> . similar systems have been used for the psvs of polyoma virus jcpyv  <cit> , enterovirus  <dig>  <cit>  and human papillomavirus   <cit> . the hpv psv system has evolved along with the success of the commercial vaccine against hpv. currently the hpv psv system is the most straightforward and widely used system in the hpv research field because the property of hpv psv is similar to that of native hpv virion.

hpv is a non-enveloped dna virus that infects cutaneous and mucosal epithelial tissues. most cases of cervical cancer are caused by infection with high-risk hpv types  <cit> . the hpv capsid is composed of  <dig> pentamers arranged on a t =  <dig> icosahedral lattice, each containing an l <dig> capsomeres  <cit> . the capsid also includes the minor capsid protein l <dig>  <cit> . it has been suggested that the center of each capsomere is occluded with an l <dig> protein, and the l <dig> protein is located within the capsid  <cit> . some of the known roles of the l <dig> protein include facilitating capsid assembly, enhancing infectivity, and encapsidation of the hpv genome  <cit> .

continuous production of the native hpv virion is difficult because its replication is strictly controlled by the cell cycle of the host cell  <cit> . for this reason, synthetic hpv particles such as virus-like particles , psvs and quasivirions  have been substituted for native hpv virions in studies investigating aspects of infection, transmission, immunogenicity, and viral structure  <cit> . vlps are composed of the l <dig> protein alone or l <dig> and l <dig> proteins , whereas the pseudovirus capsid contains both l <dig> and l <dig> proteins, and encapsidates reporter plasmid dna  <cit> . qvs also contain l <dig> and l <dig> proteins, and encapsulate full-length hpv genomes  <cit> . capsid structure is thought to be stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds between capsomeres: an analysis of recombinant hpv <dig> vlps suggested that a critical intercapsomeric disulfide bridge occurs between cys <dig> and cys <dig>  <cit> . in the case of synthetic hpv virions such as psvs, and unlike in other viruses, a long period of maturation  is required because the formation of disulfide bonds is slow  <cit> .

the hpv genome is approximately 8 kb in length and is replicated in the nucleus  <cit> . the genome of native hpv virions is thought to have a chromatin-like structure that includes host histones  <cit> , and cellular histones are also thought to be present in the mature hpv psvs  <cit> . the presence of cellular histones has been found to be associated with reduced infectivity of hpv virions and of infectious psvs. however, the properties of the histone-carrying psvs have not been investigated in detail.

it is generally agreed that differences in the heparin binding affinities of different viruses that attach to the cell via heparin sulfate are responsible for differences in their properties, such as virulence and pathogenesis . since cellular histones bind strongly to heparin  <cit> , we hypothesized that the histone-containing hpv psvs would bind heparin more strongly than those without histones. in the present work we identified three types of hpv type  <dig>  psvs according to their heparin-binding affinities, and compared their structures, infectivity and immunogenicity, in order to identify the specific characteristics of histone-carrying psvs.

RESULTS
separation of hpv <dig> psvs by heparin chromatography
mature hpv <dig> psvs were produced in 293tt cells by co-transfection of p16shell  and pyseap  and purified by size-exclusion chromatography , and the psvs were subdivided into fractions i, ii, and iii according to their heparin-binding affinities : the heparin chromatography condition facilitates separation of psvs containing small amounts of cellular histone from those with large amounts of histone. sec demonstrated that cellular histones are principally involved in the production of hpv psv . it is known that correctly folded hpv capsids and hpv psvs can bind to heparin-bound resin in  <dig>  m nacl at ph  <dig>   <cit> . in the present work  <dig>  m nacl at ph  <dig>  was used for the binding studies because under these conditions hpv psvs bind only when they contain substantial amounts of histone . thus the flow-through fraction under these conditions was designated fraction i psv. the psvs bound to the heparin were eluted successively with buffer containing  <dig>  m nacl and buffer containing 1 m nacl, and the eluted psvs were designated fraction ii and iii psvs, respectively . the detail sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  banding patterns of the fractions from the heparin chromatography can be seen in additional file 2: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> purification of mature hpv <dig> psvs by sec. a sds-page and western blots for human histone h <dig> of sec fractions of a 293tt cell lysate . b sds-page and western blots for detecting l <dig>  l <dig> and human histone h <dig> of sec fractions of a lysates of 293tt cells transfected with p16shell and pyseap. c sds-page and western blots for detecting l <dig> protein and human histone h <dig>  control refers to a mixture of fractions  <dig> –  <dig> in panel a; psv refers to a mixture of fractions  <dig> –  <dig> in panel b. m is a protein marker. psvs eluted early , whereas most cellular proteins eluted later , indicating that the psvs were larger than most of the latter . histone h <dig> co-eluted with l <dig> protein in fractions  <dig> to  <dig>  and there was no histone h <dig> in the corresponding fractions of the 293tt cell control . fractions 3– <dig> from the 293tt cell control were combined, as were fractions 3– <dig> from the 293tt cells producing hpv <dig> psvs ; they were then analyzed by sds-page and western blotting 



comparison of histone and cellular dna contents
to compare the histone h <dig> and h2b contents of the three psv types, identical amounts of psvs  were loaded . it was found that the virus-associated contents of histone protein increased in the order fractions i, ii and iii . psvs in fraction i appeared to contain small amounts of histones h <dig> and h2b, which could be seen when the antibody reaction and film exposure times were extended . it was confirmed that the amounts of cellular dnas less than 1000 bp contained in the three psvs paralleled the amounts of histones . the l <dig> protein content of each fraction of psv was determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  , and the proportions of psvs from fraction i, ii, and iii inferred from this were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  %, respectively . therefore, psv in fraction i, which contains only a small amount of cellular histone, appears to be the predominant type.fig.  <dig> analysis of histones, cellular dna contents and proportions of hpv <dig> psvs from fraction i, ii and iii. a shows sds-page and western blots comparing the l <dig>  histone h <dig> and histone h2b contents of the three types of psvs. b shows sds-page and western blots for detecting l <dig>  histone h <dig> and histone h2b in type i psvs. b is a repeat of panel a but with extended film exposure for western blots. c is a result of agarose gel showing cellular dna contents of psvs from fraction i, ii and iii. d is result showing the proportions of psvs from fraction i, ii and iii. to calculate the proportion of each type, their l <dig> content was determined by sandwich elisa. data represent the mean ± sd of four independent experiments



comparison of the structural integrity of hpv <dig> psvs from fraction i, ii and iii
the psvs were negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid and observed by transmission electron microscopy  . fraction i psvs appeared to be highly ordered and condensed and to be slightly smaller than those from fractions ii and iii . fraction ii psvs were also highly ordered but their capsomers could be seen more clearly than those of fraction i particles, indicating that they were more loosely connected. fraction iii psvs stained strongly and appeared to consist of blackened particles . interestingly, the fraction iii psvs had a fuzzy appearance , which we believe was due to the large amounts of associated cellular histones and dna. when the psvs were stained with immunogold to detect human histone h <dig>  the surfaces of fractions ii and iii particles appeared to be covered by this histone . the tem images indicated that fraction i psvs were smaller and had a more condensed structure than fractions ii and iii psvs.fig.  <dig> tem analysis of hpv <dig> psvs of fractions i, ii and iii. the presented images were representatives from triple observations. magnification is  <dig> ×

expression of reporter gene and reporter gene contents of hpv <dig> psvs from fraction i, ii and iii
the expression levels of reporter gene, secreted alkaline phosphatase , in the different psv fractions were compared . to use identical amounts of psvs from three heparin chromatography fractions, the l <dig> contents were determined by sandwich elisas and confirmed by western blots prior to measure the seap expressions. 293tt cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates, and each type of psv was serially diluted from 25 ng/ml to  <dig>  ng/ml and incubated for 72 h at 37 °c . moreover, the reporter gene contents of psvs from three fractions were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  . the seap expression levels were significantly lower in fraction ii and iii psvs than in fraction i  whereas the amount of the pyseap reporter plasmid associated with fraction ii particles appeared to be similar to that associated with fraction i particles . the amount of the pyseap reporter plasmid associated with fraction iii particles was substantially lower . agarose gel analysis  supported the result of the quantitative real-time pcr in fig. 5b. these results indicate that substantial amounts of cellular histones are detrimental for formation of psv with high expression level of seap.fig.  <dig> quantification of seap and pyseap. a relative seap expressions of psv particles. each type of psv was serially diluted from  <dig> to  <dig>  ng/ml , and seap expression levels were determined as described in methods. b relative pyseap amounts of psv particles. the values for fraction i psvs in panel b were set at 100 %. a shows the mean ± sd of duplicate samples, and b presents the mean ± sd of four independent experiments. **, p <  <dig> 



the immunogenicity of hpv <dig> psvs from fraction i, ii and iii
mice were immunized three times with hpv <dig> psvs, and neutralizing antibody titers were measured . fraction ii and iii psvs elicited lower levels of neutralizing antibody  than fraction i psv. in addition, the mice immunized with psvs from fraction iii gave only weak lymphoproliferative responses upon stimulation with hpv <dig> l <dig> vlps .fig.  <dig> antibody responses following three immunizations with 50 ng of psvs per dose. mice were immunized with psvs  without adjuvant. neutralizing antibody titers against hpv <dig> psvs in mouse sera were determined as described in methods. horizontal bars correspond to median values. pbs, n = 7; type i, n = 7; type ii, n = 7; type iii, n = 7



discussion
our results indicated that condensed structure, a substantial amount of a plasmid containing the reporter gene and a low content of cellular histones are important for the formation of infectious and immunogenic hpv <dig> psvs. of the hpv <dig> psvs, 83 % appeared to be fraction i psvs, which fulfil the requirements for highly infectious and immunogenic psvs , whereas about 17 % of the psvs  were found to have lower infectivity and immunogenicity . therefore, it appears that most hpv <dig> psv undergo assembly and maturation with high fidelity.

psvs are known to undergo assembly within the cell, and the resulting particles are in an immature state with their capsomers only loosely connected to each other immediately after cell lysis  <cit> . these immature psvs can be condensed and stabilized by a maturation process that requires incubation at 37 °c overnight  <cit> . it has been suggested that there are substantial losses of virus titer and of encapsidated reporter gene plasmids during the purification of immature psv  <cit> . recently, cardone and colleagues analyzed the structures of hpv <dig> psvs by time-lapse cryo-electron microscopy  <cit> . they reported that the diameter of the immature psvs shrank by ∼ 5 % in the maturation process during which the interaction surfaces between adjacent capsomers were consolidated. as shown in fig.  <dig> psvs from fraction i are slightly smaller and more condensed than those from fraction ii or iii. in addition the capsomers of fraction ii particles were less tightly connected. infections with particles in fraction ii and iii led to the much lower expression of seap than infections with particles in fraction i . therefore, the integrities of fraction ii and iii particles are similar to those of immature psvs while the integrity of fraction i particles correspond to that of mature psvs.

seap expression was significantly reduced in psvs from fraction ii  as was the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies  although they harbor substantial levels of reporter gene plasmids  and have relatively satisfactory architectural structures . the position of the l <dig> protein is known to be important for encapsidation of the reporter gene plasmid  <cit> . however, we found that the three psv types did not differ in terms of their l <dig> protein content . in addition, elisas using monoclonal antibodies h <dig> v <dig> and h <dig> e <dig>  which have been widely used for detecting neutralizing epitopes of the hpv <dig> capsid, indicated that the level of neutralizing epitopes on the surface of fraction ii particles was similar to the level on the surface of fraction i particles . therefore, it seems that the structural robustness of fraction ii psvs is not enough for efficient delivery of the reporter gene into target cells, and its neutralizing epitopes are not recognized correctly by cells of the immune system. psvs in fraction ii were found to be covered by substantial amounts of cellular histones and cellular nucleotides  and it seems likely that these interfere with binding of the psvs to cell receptors and their correct recognition by immune cells.

previous reports have indicated that viral dnas containing histone, and naked dnas without histone, coexist in native hpv preparations, and it was suggested that the dnas of bovine papillomavirus  and hpv have a chromatin-like structure composed of nucleosomes about  <dig>  nm in diameter, interconnected by naked dna filaments  <cit> . histone-free hpv dna has been found in native hpv virions  <cit> , and there are no histones in purified bpv  <cit> . therefore, the suggestion has been made that the complex of hpv dna with nucleoproteins is a natural intermediate during virion assembly.

the histone-containing fractions in our study were derived from hpv <dig> psvs rather than native hpv virions. our results indicated that the presence of cellular histones was detrimental to the formation of infectious psv. however, whether the binding of histone to the surface of hpv <dig> psvs shown in fig.  <dig> is inherent to the hpv virion remains to be clarified. the suggested model of the assembly of hpv capsid is that the c-terminal proximal h <dig> helix of each l <dig> molecule in a capsomere invades a neighboring l <dig> molecule in an adjacent capsomere and forms an intermolecular disulfide bond  <cit> . l <dig> protein has a dna binding domain at its c-terminus  <cit> . therefore, there are two kinds of explanation for the effects of cellular histone. first, since immature hpv <dig> psvs have greater space between neighboring capsomers  they may expose more of their dna binding domains and so allow more binding of cellular dna plus histones. alternatively, the presence of cellular histones and cellular dnas during assembly of the capsid may hinder condensation of the capsids.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that a low content of cellular histone and cellular dna of hpv <dig> psv and a condensed structure are important for the formation of high quality hpv <dig> psvs. we believe that the content of cellular histone is a critical parameter for assessing the quality and stage of maturation of hpv <dig> psv. also, the heparin chromatography technique described here appears to be a useful tool for separating psv particles of high quality from the total pool of mature psvs.
