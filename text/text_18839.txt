BACKGROUND
patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation  are at a high risk of serious infection, mainly due to both the procedure and the underlying disease requiring the transplant, which in most patients undergoing the procedure is hematological  <cit> .

mannose-binding lectin  is a circulating liver-synthesized c-type serum protein of importance in the innate immune defense system. it is one of the recognition molecules in the lectin complement activation pathway  <cit> . human mbl is derived from a single gene located on chromosome  <dig>   <cit> .

serum levels and the function of mbl oligomers are strongly influenced by genetic variants  <cit> . low levels of mbl have been associated with increased susceptibility to infections, especially in recurrent or severe forms, even in immunocompetent individuals  <cit> . however, isolated low mbl serum levels do not usually cause disease. this deficiency appears to be associated with severe infections when other immune deficiencies occur  <cit> .

the effect of mbl deficiency in the infectious complications of patients receiving chemotherapy is variable  <cit> . it has been associated with serious infections and more prolonged episodes of febrile neutropenia  <cit> , as well as with an earlier first severe infection in deficient patients  <cit> . there are also several studies which analyze the relationship between mbl and allogeneic stem cell transplantation infections  <cit> , but until now, only two studies dealing with this issue in asct have been published  <cit> . the focus of this study is the association between mbl <dig> gene variants and the risk of infections in patients with different hematologic diseases undergoing asct.

patients and methods
patients
a prospective cohort study of all patients who received an asct for hematologic disease from february  <dig> to june  <dig> in the hospital universitario marqués de valdecilla  was performed. all transplanted patients >13 years old without immunodeficiency  were included. patients were followed up after inclusion in the study for 6 months.

infections
intercurrent infections were monitored during the early period , the intermediate period  and the late period . infections were prospectively collected by the clinical research associates from the institution using a standardized data collection form, following the protocols of the hematology department of the hospital universitario marqués de valdecilla, in compliance with the clinical guidelines of the infectious diseases society of america  <cit> . prophylactic measures included isolation in high-pressure rooms with air filters and the administration of intravenous acyclovir at prophylactic doses from day - <dig>  antibiotics and antifungal prophylaxis were not routinely administered.

an infectious episode was defined as a microbiologically or clinically documented infection. microbiologically documented infections with the same organisms during the same phase of therapy occurring more than 7 days apart were counted as different infections. major infection was predefined as either sepsis confirmed on microbiological testing or a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with highly suggestive radiographic or clinical characteristics and the requirement for a specific antimicrobial treatment in both cases. the following conditions were excluded: single positive blood culture resulting from contaminant skin bacteria, upper respiratory tract infections, culture-negative interstitial pneumonitis, dermatological varicella zoster reactivation, and local herpes simplex reactivation. severe herpes virus infection was predefined as invasive viral infections requiring prompt treatment and hospitalization. a positive cytomegalovirus  blood culture or cmv-pp <dig> antigenemia assay or polymerase chain reaction  for cmv dna   and symptoms of organ dysfunction were required to fulfill the criteria of a clinically significant cmv infection/reactivation  <cit> . episodes of asymptomatic cmv reactivation, primary varicella zoster virus and epstein-barr virus infections were excluded.

mbl <dig> genotyping
blood was collected in edta-stabilized tubes in compliance with approved protocols from our institution. genomic dna from patients and controls was extracted from peripheral blood by using the maxwell  <dig> genomic dna purification system. for mbl <dig> gene amplification and genotyping, the inno-lipa mbl <dig>  was used, following the manufacturer’s instructions. the inno-lipa mbl <dig> is a line probe assay, designed for genotyping the  <dig> variations in the human mbl <dig> gene , providing an analysis of the seven common haplotypes and the  <dig> possible resulting diplotypes.

exon mutations called structural variants  and promoter polymorphisms  were analyzed. variants ya/ya, xa/xa and ya/xa were classified as a/a. those with any mutation in the exon such as ya/o, xa/o were classified as a/o and, lastly, individuals homozygous for the structural variants in the exon were considered as o/o. thus, patients were divided in two groups according to their mbl <dig> genotype: 1) normal homozygous patients  and 2) patients with ao and oo genotypes, who were considered to be lower mbl producers  <cit> .

statistical analysis
results were analyzed according to mbl <dig> genotype, comparing normal homozygous patients  and patients with ao and oo genotype and to determine if there were differences between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics, underlying disease, infection parameters and mortality. statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed χ <dig> test and a fisher’s exact test, student t-test or mann whitney, as appropriate in each case. for m × n tables, a fisher’s exact test was estimated using the monte carlo method. relative risks  and their 95% confidence intervals  were calculated to analyze the association between genetic variants and polymorphisms and the risk of concomitant infections as dependent variables . multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression to estimate the association between genetic variants and polymorphisms and the risk of underlying infections adjusted by confusion factors. a regression model was constructed for each type of infection, with infection-related variables being the outcome and the independent variable being the mbl <dig> genotypes, adjusted for sex, age, hematologic disease, active pre-transplant hematologic disease. a two-tailed p < <dig>  was considered statistically significant. data were analyzed using stata  and spss   statistical software.

ethics
this study was approved by the ethics committee of the autonomous community of cantabria, spain. all patients  signed informed consent to participate in the study. for children under 18 years, the parents had to sign informed consent.

fifteen major episodes of infection were recorded: sepsis in  <dig> patients; pneumonia in  <dig> patients, including one pulmonary aspergillosis and one mucor pneumonia; and  <dig> patients with severe diarrheal episodes . a higher incidence of major episodes of infection was observed in the variant mbl <dig> group,  <dig> % versus  <dig> % in the mbl <dig> wild-type group: rr =  <dig> , , although this did not reach statistical significance.

there were  <dig> microbiologically documented infections  in  <dig> patients. fifty-six  of these infections occurred in the early period,  <dig>  in the intermediate and  <dig>  in the late period. there were  <dig> infections caused by gram-positive bacteria,  <dig> caused by gram-negative bacteria,  <dig> fungal infections and  <dig> infections caused by virus. eight were polymicrobial infections.

the average number of microbiologically documented infections was not statistically significant different between both groups, although there was a greater number of infections with microbiological documentation in the variant mbl <dig> group:  <dig>   versus  <dig>  .

there was a higher average of microbiologically documented episodes of infection in the early period in the variant mbl <dig> group , than in the mbl <dig> wild-type , but this did not reach statistical significance.

the average time in days until the first infection after the transplantation day was  <dig>  days  in the wild-type mbl <dig> group and 13 days  in the mbl <dig> variant group .

regarding the type of infection, gram-positive bacteria were more frequent in the mbl <dig> variant group,  <dig> % versus  <dig> %, rr =  <dig>  . there was a greater incidence of infections caused by staphylococcus epidermidis in the mbl <dig> variant group,  <dig> % versus 17%, rr =  <dig>  . in the adjusted analysis, the odds ratio  was  <dig>  , at the limit of statistical significance . there was only  <dig> case of infection by staphylococcus aureus, in the mbl <dig> wild-type group.

most infections caused by gram-positive bacteria occurred in the early period and were more frequent in the variant mbl <dig> group . there were no such infections in the intermediate period and only one in each group in the late period.

the incidence of fungal infections in the variant mbl <dig> group  was statistically significantly higher than in the mbl <dig> wild-type group , rr =  <dig>  , as confirmed in a multivariate analysis .

there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of infection caused by gram-negative bacteria, rr:  <dig>  , or by virus between both groups, rr:  <dig>  , although there was a higher incidence of viral infections in the variant mbl <dig> group.

more patients died in the variant mbl <dig> group than in the wild-type mbl <dig> group , although this difference was not statistically significant. however, all deaths in the variant mbl <dig> group were related to infection, whereas in the wild-type mbl <dig> group, deaths were due to other causes, with a p-value of  <dig>  at the limit of statistical significance .

discussion
this prospective study focused on comparing the incidence of infection and mortality after asct between patients with the wild-type mbl <dig> genotype compared to patients carrying a variant mbl <dig> genotype. the mbl <dig> variant is associated with lower levels of serum mbl, so it may be related with a greater number of infections and/or more serious infections. a multivariate analysis was performed to rule out other factors that could cause a higher incidence or severity of infection .

the study group was homogeneous, with no differences in age, gender or hematologic disease, and presented similar disease activity at the time of transplantation.

so far, there are few studies describing the incidence of infections in asct related to mbl <dig> gene variants. horiuchi et al. <cit>  in a series of  <dig> patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and asct, most of whom had hematologic diseases, carried out a study of the incidence of major bacterial infection in patients with low-producing genotypes compared to the wild-type genotype, finding an association between the low-producing genotypes and a highly increased and significant risk of major bacterial infections. the incidence of major bacterial infections  was lower than that observed in the current study . this could be related with the use of prophylactic antimicrobials including ciprofloxacin and fluconazole in all their patients, in contrast to the usual practice in our center.

mølle et al.  <cit> , in a retrospective study compared mbl <dig> gene variants with the risk of severe infections in multiple myeloma in patients receiving asct after high-dose melphalan. they found that patients homozygous for wild-type mbl <dig> had a significantly reduced risk of septicemia compared to patients carrying the variant mbl <dig>  in our series, no differences were found in the number of patients with sepsis between the two groups. although the lack of association between these infections and mbl <dig> gene variants could be explained by the sample size, this could also be due to the different underlying diseases: in mølle’s study, all patients were diagnosed with multiple myeloma while our patients had heterogeneous hematologic diseases and therefore could have had a higher risk of infection. they also found more severe infections in patients with variant mbl <dig>  although the differences were not statistically significant. similarly, in our series more severe infections and a greater number of episodes of pneumonia were found in patients with variant mbl <dig> 

when the incidence of infections caused by different microorganisms was analyzed, a higher number of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria was found in patients carrying the variant mbl <dig> form, and these were mainly staphylococci. in this respect, the incidence of infections caused by staphylococcus epidermidis was greater in the mbl <dig> variant group. these findings contrast with the similar number of central venous catheter infections found in both groups. this could mean that the increased number of infections caused by s. epidermidis is not only due to catheter infection. asct patients carrying the variant mbl <dig> genotype, with mbl deficiency, may develop more s. epidermidis infections. however, the mechanism for this difference is unclear. a study by hellemann et al.  <cit>  in critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care, showed an association between the mbl <dig> o/o genotype with an increased incidence of gram-positive infections. however, in two different studies by neth et al.  <cit>  and shang et al.  <cit> , s. epidermidis generally demonstrated low mbl binding activity, which would contradict the hypothesis that mbl plays an important role in infections caused by s. epidermidis. one explanation that has been proposed for the diversity between the different studies may rely on the fact that mbl also functions as a scavenger molecule in maintaining internal tissue homeostasis. apparent mbl associations may be due to disturbances in this scavenger system, rather than a direct antiinfectious effect  <cit> .

in the current study, no differences were found in the incidence of infections caused by gram-negative bacteria in patients with wild-type mbl <dig> genotype versus patients carrying a variant mbl <dig> genotype. this is consistent with the studies by hellemann  <cit>  and sutherland  <cit> . there was only one case of viral infection in each group; in the mbl <dig> variant group this was caused by cmv, a potentially very serious disease, while the virus in the mbl <dig> wild-type group was a reactivation of varicella zoster, which is more common in hematological patients.

granell et al.  <cit>  showed that mbl pathway dysfunction due to genetically determined deficiencies of mbl influence the outcome of allogenic stem cell transplantation by increasing susceptibility to fungal invasive infections. in patients with asct, horiuchi et al.  <cit>  found that  <dig> of the  <dig> patients with major infections who had a pulmonary aspergillosis were homozygous for a, i.e. the normal mbl allele. on the contrary, in our study,  <dig> patients with fungal infection carried the mbl <dig> deficient genotype;  <dig> had aspergillus and mucor pneumonia ;  <dig> had candidemia; and  <dig> had disseminated mucocutaneous candida infection. several studies have been published showing that mbl may play a crucial role in the innate immunity against yeast infections by increasing pmn uptake  <cit> .

in our series, the incidence of mortality due to infection was higher in the mbl <dig> variant form, and the cause of death in all patients was major infection. these findings are in line with other groups of immunosuppressed patients who had low-producing mbl <dig> genotypes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the results of our study suggest that asct patients with the mbl <dig> variant gene have increased fungal infections, which would suggest that mbl offers protection against such infections. it would be reasonable to assess whether early antifungal prophylaxis in our asct patients with the mbl <dig> variant gene could reduce the incidence of such infections. due to the contradictory results of the previous reports, further studies are needed to clarify whether low-producing mbl <dig> genotypes could play a role in gram-positive infections, especially in s. epidermidis infections. asct patients with mbl <dig> variant genotypes are more likely to die as a result of an infection.
