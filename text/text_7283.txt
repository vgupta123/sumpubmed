BACKGROUND
five big charismatic cats: panthera leo , panthera tigris , panthera onca , panthera pardus  and uncia uncia  have been placed taxonomically in pantherinae subfamily. they have been drawing attention of biologists due to important ecological roles  <cit> . consequently, extensive information is available on their natural history, morphology, behaviour, reproduction, evolutionary history and population genetic structure, which provides a rich basis for interpreting genetic data  <cit> . the information is still not adequate to overcome their highly threatened status. hence, molecular study is vital to further explore the genetic information which can be helpful for conservation.

panthera leo has two geographically isolated populations; panthera leo leo , and panthera leo persica   <cit> . the asiatic lion population is accorded endangered species status under the indian wildlife protection act, consisting only  <dig> wild animals  <cit> . this population exist in and around gir forest in the southwest part of saurashtra region in the state of gujarat, india. presence of geographically confined single population having its origin from small nucleus group and constituting single gene pool, raises concerns about genetic diversity in asiatic lion population. morphological and molecular approaches like allozyme study  <cit>  microsatellite analysis  <cit> , protein markers and mitochondrial 12s gene  <cit>  have been used to unveil the evolutionary history of this species. earlier efforts have been made to undertake the population study of panthera leo persica  and other allied species  <cit>  to establish phylogenetic status. however, it has been found to be perplexing  <cit> .

for the last decade, mitochondrial dna has been one of the most commonly used molecular marker in vertebrates for studying phylogeny and evolutionary relationships  <cit>  among closely related species and subspecies  <cit> . it can reveal evolutionary relatedness and elucidate large numbers of genome-level characteristics, such as relative arrangements of genes  <cit> . it also has a great importance for the molecular identification of species. cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase subunit i  <cit>  are mitochondrial genes widely used for molecular identification of animals. further, key mitochondrial features - a lack of recombination, essentially maternal inheritance, high evolutionary rate, compact size, and conserved gene order  <cit> , have led to its wide spread use.

earlier, phylogenetic relationship of the genus panthera was studied using morphological, biochemical as well as molecular characters but it is still debatable and troublesome because of large disparities between these studies. the difficulty in resolving their phylogenetic relationships is a result of  a poor fossil record,  recent and rapid radiation during the pliocene,  individual speciation events occurring within less than  <dig> million years  probable introgression between lineages following their divergence  <cit> . phylogenetic relationship and position of panthera leo, amongst the genus panthera, has some knowledge gaps. the present study aims to provide some insights through the complete mitogenome of the asiatic lion.

RESULTS
mitochondrial genome sequence of any subspecies of panthera leo, is not reported in literature. present study describes sequencing of complete mitogenome of asiatic lion  with the use of next generation sequencing technology on ion torrentpgm platform. the relationship of lion subspecies with other felidae species and their evolutionary status has also been described on the basis of comparative analysis of mitogenomes.

base composition of mitochondrial genome of panthera leo persica
the complete mitogenome sequence of p. leo persica is  <dig>  bp in length , which is larger than panthera pardus  and uncia uncia . the base composition of mitogenome of p. leo persica is a,  <dig> bp ; t,  <dig> bp ; c,  <dig> bp ; g,  <dig> bp ; a+t  <dig> bp , g+c  <dig> . base a is highest among the  <dig> bases; g is the lowest. features of lion mitogenome were compared with genomes of felidae family. the genome size varies from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp mainly because of variation in control region length. gc content of all the genomes is ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % .

structure of mitogenome of panthera leo persica
location of the mitochondrial genes were deduced, using online annotation server mitos  <cit> . complete mitogenome contained  <dig> genes which include  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> rrna genes,  <dig> trna genes and the control region . gene order and origin of reading frame of all protein coding genes were identical to carnivora. major difference in p. leo persica mitogenome was observed in size of the control region .

transfer rna was annotated in a single letter amino acid code. ohr and olr represent the replication origins of h strand and l strand. except for nd <dig>  all protein coding genes were h strand encoded. position of genes and control regions  were indicated with arabic numerals .

proteins and codons
the studied mitogenome comprise of  <dig> protein coding genes  and share  <dig> % of total genome. these genes encode  <dig> amino acids . the longest gene was nd <dig>  and the shortest gene was atp <dig> . the start and termination codons appeared universal among species. atg was commonly used as start codon for all the genes except nd <dig>  nd <dig>  cox <dig>  nd <dig> and nd <dig>  which used ata, att and atc, respectively. taa was commonly found as stop codon while cyt b ended with aga. termination of cyt b gene with aga, is typical for mammalian species  <cit>  which is distinct from others such as amphibians  <cit> , reptiles  <cit> , aves  <cit>  and nematoda  <cit> . nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig> and cox <dig> have incomplete stop codons. these incomplete termination codons are common in metazoan mitogenome and can be converted into complete ones by poly a after transcription   <cit> .

trna and rrna
total  <dig> trna genes were found in mitogenome of p. leo persica, amongst these trnaser and trnaleu had two termination codons . length of the trna genes in vertebrates is reported from  <dig> to  <dig> bp  <cit> . in this study, the shortest trna is trnaser  and longest is trnaleu . cloverleaf secondary structure of trnas of this genome was predicted, out of which representative structures of trnaphe and trnaser are shown . out of all trnas, trnaser lacked the “dhu” arm  <cit> . the location of 12s rrna  was between trnaphe and trnaval and 16s rrna  was between trnaval and trnaleu.

control region
the control region of the mitogenome of p. leo persica is located between trnapro and trnaphe. it contains only promoters and regulatory sequences for replication and transcription, but no structural genes . cr is divided into three parts: the left domain  which includes the hyper variable segment hvs- <dig>  the central conserved region  of  <dig> bp, and the right domain of , which include hvs- <dig>  further the repetitive sequence rs- <dig> is in the left domain located at the 5’ end. it consists of long repetitive motif of about  <dig> bp which is repeated  <dig>  times . rs- <dig> is located in right domain at 3’ end. it consists of short repeat units of  <dig> bp which is repeated  <dig> times . rs- <dig> is highly variable in the arrangement of specific motifs and is heteroplasmic. it is varied in terms of repeat numbers and motif among felidae species   <cit> . when there are repeats in the genome longer than the read length, it is important to confirm ngs data with capillary sequencing. here, rs- <dig> and rs- <dig> repeats have longer region than read length of ion torrent pgm. hence rs- <dig> and rs- <dig> were validated with capillary sequencing and capillary data  was replaced in original genome obtained from ngs. conserved sequence blocks  are in hvs- <dig>  csb- <dig> is in the ccr, which is located between rs- <dig> and rs- <dig>  cr of p. leo persica comprises  <dig>  bp and it contains origin of heavy chain replication. the capillary data of rs <dig> and rs <dig> repeats was submitted to tra .

rs <dig> motif sequence remains conserved, while rs <dig> motif varies in felidae family.

phylogenetic analyses based on gene cluster
phylogenetic analyses was carried out on the basis of partial  <cit>  and full gene sequences of 12s rrna, 16s rrna, nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  atp <dig> and cyt b using ml, mp methods . the monophyly of the genus panthera, including p. leo persica, uncia uncia, panthera pardus, panthera tigris amoyensis, panthera tigris, and neofelis nebulosa was clearly depicted. results demonstrate 100% bootstrap value in ml method and 99% in mp method, using full gene sequences of p. leo persica . previously sequenced panthera leo partial genes formed node with uncia uncia with 96% bootstrap value in ml method and 88% in mp method . this study strongly supports that p. leo persica is a sister species of p. pardus, than of u. uncia, as earlier reported  <cit> . n. nebulosa was forming distinct branch. p. tigris and p. tigris amoyensis being same species, formed different branch in the panthera node while u. uncia was placed in the lineage between tiger and lion-leopard node.

estimates of divergence times
the ml and bayesian analyses based on  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes, excluding control region yielded the identical tree topology supported by high bootstrap value  and high posterior probabilities . uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock  and strict molecular clock model  were studied to estimate divergence times. data of uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock were considered for lineage specific rate heterogeneity. divergence time was estimated using single calibration point at  <dig>  mya for felidae individuals, assuming common ancestor between genus panthera and other felinae species  <cit> . beast analysis suggested divergence time of felidae individual was  <dig>  mya  from the common ancestor. the divergence of p. leo persica was estimated  <dig>  mya from the closely related species p. pardus . divergence of other individuals; n. nebulosa , p. tigris  and u. uncia . estimation of divergence times of genus panthera in the present study reconfirms earlier reports  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
present study is the first report of complete mitogenome of p. leo persica among all eight subspecies. the evolutionary timeline estimates of big cats based on mitogenome analysis, indicates existence of common ancestor of p. leo and p. pardus  <dig>  mya in modern piacenzian era. the significant degree of genetic differentiation of asiatic lion from other big cats, suggest independent evolution of subspecies described as p. leo persica. complete mitogenome sequence provide sufficient information to resolve the events of divergence of felidae.
