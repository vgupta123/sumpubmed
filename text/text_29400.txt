BACKGROUND
the vertebrate inner ear provides auditory and vestibular functions and develops from the otic placode, a transient thickening of head ectoderm adjacent to the developing hindbrain. in zebrafish the otic placode cavitates to form the otic vesicle also known as the otocyst, an epithelial structure with sharply defined borders, which later gives rise to the inner ear including its neurons and structural elements  <cit> .

studies in various species suggest that otic placode formation is a multi-step process. cranial placodes, including the otic placode, arise from a common region, the preplacodal domain that extends around the anterior neural plate border. formation of the preplacodal domain represents the earliest stage of placode induction and is regulated by multiple signaling pathways including bmp, wnt and fgf  <cit> . subsequently, fgf signals from the adjacent hindbrain and underlying mesoderm induce cells within the preplacodal domain to form the otic placode . in zebrafish, fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> have been implicated as having overlapping functions in otic placode induction  <cit> . both genes are expressed in the future hindbrain by late gastrula stages, and fgf <dig> is also expressed at this stage in the underlying mesendoderm. loss of either fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> leads to a reduction in ear size and loss of both fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> together results in near or total ablation of otic tissue. in mouse, fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> act as redundant signals during otic induction  <cit> . fgf <dig> is expressed in the hindbrain region that abuts the preotic domain, whereas fgf <dig> is expressed in the mesoderm beneath it; loss of both fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> results in complete ablation of otic development  <cit> . furthermore, fgf <dig> has been shown to play a critical role upstream of the fgf signaling cascade required for otic induction in this species  <cit> . in chick, fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> and in amphibians, fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> have been implicated in otic induction  <cit> .

misexpression studies indicate that fgf signaling is not only necessary but also sufficient for otic induction  <cit> . however, the region where ectopic otic structures formed was inconsistent in these studies, ranging from limited induction in the region surrounding the endogenous ear  <cit>  to widespread ectopic otic induction at the expense of other sensory organs  <cit> . infection of chick embryonic hindbrain and surface ectoderm with an fgf3-expression virus vector at early somite stages results in an enlarged otocyst and ectopic otic vesicles just anterior and posterior to the normal otic vesicle  <cit> . furthermore, implantation of beads coated with fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> close to the developing placode in the chick embryo at early segmentation stages produces a similar result  <cit> . an enlarged otic placode and enlarged otic vesicle have also been reported in zebrafish after overexpression of fgf <dig> by mrna injections at the 2-cell stage and after implantation of fgf8-coated beads at shield stage  <cit> . in contrast, injection of 8-cell stage zebrafish embryos with plasmid dna containing fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> under the control of a constitutive promoter leads to early variegated misexpression of fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> and ectopic otic induction all around the anterior neural plate border at the expense of other sensory organs  <cit> . similar results were obtained in medaka after misexpression of fgf <dig> under the control of an artificial heat shock promoter at midgastrula stages  <cit> . treatment of zebrafish embryos with retinoic acid greatly expands the hindbrain expression domains of fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> and leads to fgf-dependent formation of ectopic, supernumerary otic vesicles abutting the anterior neural plate  <cit> .

transplantation experiments suggest that competence of naive ectoderm to form an otic placode is initially widespread but becomes restricted to a region adjacent to the hindbrain by late gastrula or early neurula stages . we previously proposed that foxi <dig> and dlx3b may provide the molecular basis for this competence to form an ear  <cit> . expression of the homeobox gene, dlx3b, is initiated at the beginning of gastrulation on the future ventral side of the embryo and together with dlx4b, is restricted in late gastrula stage embryos to a stripe corresponding to cells of the future neural plate border. expression of both genes is subsequently further restricted to cells of the future olfactory and otic placodes by the beginning of somitogenesis  <cit> . knockdown of dlx3b and dlx4b together causes severe loss of otic tissue even in the presence of functional fgf signaling, consistent with them playing a role to specify the competence of cells to form the ear  <cit> . expression of the forkhead winged helix transcription factor, foxi <dig>  is initiated prior to gastrulation in the future ventral half of the embryo and is progressively restricted to bilateral regions including the preotic domain at late gastrula stages  <cit> . disruption of foxi <dig> leads to severe defects in otic placode formation and highly variable ear phenotypes  <cit>  suggesting that foxi <dig> may also influence otic competence. loss of both dlx3b and foxi <dig> together ablates all indications of otic induction even in the presence of a fully functional fgf signaling pathway  <cit> . bmp signaling may regulate early expression of both dlx3b and foxi <dig> because dlx3b is not expressed in bmp2b mutant embryos and overexpression of the bmp-binding antagonist noggin by mrna injection completely abolishes foxi <dig> expression  <cit> . in addition to bmp, fgf signaling has also been implicated as a regulator of foxi <dig>  although the published results are inconsistent  <cit> ; phillips et al.  <cit>  report that localized misexpression of fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> can induce high-level expression of foxi <dig> in the anterior head region, whereas fürthauer et al.  <cit>  and kudoh et al.  <cit>  show that fgf signaling represses foxi <dig> expression.

here we show that fgf signaling has different consequences for otic induction depending upon the developmental stage. due to its repression of non-neural ventral fate before and during gastrulation, fgf activity early in development leads to ablation or reduction of otic tissue which is foreshadowed by the loss or reduction of dlx3b and foxi <dig>  respectively. we demonstrate that neither dlx3b nor foxi <dig> is activated by fgf signaling, but rather bmp signaling regulates dlx3b indirectly and foxi <dig> directly. later at the end of gastrulation, however, activation of the fgf signaling pathway leads to dlx3b and foxi <dig> dependent formation of ectopic otic tissue. our results support the hypothesis that foxi <dig> and dlx3b provide competence for cells to respond to fgf signaling and form an otic placode.

RESULTS
misexpression of fgf <dig> induces ectopic otic tissue within the normal otic field
it was recently shown that fgf signaling is not only necessary but also sufficient for otic induction. several studies showed that gain of fgf function results in expanded or ectopic otic induction, however, the location and extent of this effect was inconsistent among the studies  <cit> . differences in the time during development that fgf signaling was increased in these various studies might explain these inconsistencies.

to control the time of fgf signaling precisely, we generated a stable transgenic line that allows us to express fgf <dig> uniformly under the control of the zebrafish temperature-inducible hsp <dig> promoter. we tested the reliability of the line by monitoring fgf <dig> expression in transgenic animals before and after heat shock at the end of gastrulation and at midsegmentation stages. without heat shock, all embryos from a cross between heterozygous hsp:fgf <dig> and wild-type fish show the endogenous pattern of fgf <dig> expression. following a  <dig> minute heat shock at either developmental stage, we observe strong and ubiquitous expression of fgf <dig> in 50% of the progeny. expression levels of fgf <dig> under these conditions are very high and, thus, mask endogenous fgf <dig> expression . ectopic fgf <dig> mrna is gradually lost within approximately  <dig> minutes of its onset, indicating that heat shock leads to strong overexpression of fgf <dig> for a relatively short period of time .

using this line and fgf <dig> mrna injections, we subsequently examined the consequences of fgf <dig> misexpression at various times during development as indicated by, starmaker  that is expressed throughout the otic vesicle epithelium from early vesicle stages. overexpression of fgf <dig> by mrna injection at the 1-cell to 2-cell stage leads to severe dorsalization and expansion of the neural plate at the expense of epidermal and preplacodal ectoderm; hence, embryos display severe reduction  or complete loss  of otic tissue . misexpression of fgf <dig> upon heat shock from late blastula through gastrula stages also causes dorsalization, and embryos show a reduction in the size of the otic vesicle . the size of the otic vesicle that forms is correlated with the time at which fgf <dig> is overexpressed. a very small vesicle forms after fgf <dig> misexpression before gastrulation, whereas later misexpression of fgf <dig> leads to larger otic vesicles. larger than normal otic vesicles are produced after overexpression of fgf <dig> at the end of gastrulation or during early segmentation stages , and misexpression at the later time also frequently resulted in duplicated otic vesicles . misexpression of fgf <dig> at even later stages, such as the 8-somite stage, either has no effect on otic vesicle size or produces slightly smaller otic vesicles, presumably due to patterning defects . although fgf <dig> misexpression during gastrulation appears to increase the number of cells fated for otic development, as evidenced by the increase in otic vesicle size, in no case did we observe signs of ectopic otic tissue outside of the normal ear field, that is, outside the field of cells that normally express the putative otic competence factors, dlx3b and foxi <dig>  we also did not observe formation of ectopic otic vesicles at the expense of other sensory organs. our results suggest that the ability of ubiquitously expressed fgf <dig> to act as an ear inducing factor is restricted to times between the end of gastrulation and early segmentation and to the region where the ear normally forms.

misexpression of fgf <dig> affects the expression of foxi <dig> and dlx3b
we and others recently showed that loss of both foxi <dig> and dlx3b together ablates all indications of otic induction even in the presence of a fully functional fgf signaling pathway  <cit> . because both transcription factors are already expressed by gastrulation stages, we hypothesized that otic vesicle loss or reduction after fgf <dig> overexpression might be due to compromised expression of foxi <dig> and/or dlx3b. to test this hypothesis, we induced misexpression of fgf <dig> at various times and then fixed embryos at late gastrulation stages when fgf-dependent otic induction begins. overexpression of fgf <dig> by mrna injection at the 1-cell stage, which prevents otic vesicle formation, frequently  leads to embryos showing a complete loss of foxi <dig> and dlx3b . misexpression of fgf <dig> at late blastula or early gastrulation stages, which results in smaller otic vesicles at later stages, causes reduced expression of both foxi <dig> and dlx3b, showing again a strong correlation between the onset of fgf <dig> overexpression and the size of the foxi <dig> and dlx3b expression domains .

the effect of fgf <dig> on foxi <dig> and dlx3b expression is probably due to its early role in dorsoventral patterning. it was recently shown that the balance between fgf and bmp signaling regulates dorsoventral patterning of the zebrafish embryo into prospective neural and epidermal domains  <cit> . furthermore, recent results suggest that fgf induced activation of map kinase is able to interfere with bmp signaling by phosphorylation of specific residues in the linker region of smad <dig>  leading to smad <dig> inactivation  <cit> . we find that after overexpression of fgf <dig>  the reduced foxi <dig> and dlx3b expression domains still overlap p <dig>  an epidermal marker, and are complementary to sox <dig>  a neural marker . this indicates that ectopic activation of fgf signaling at late blastula or early gastrulation stages is still able to activate neural fate at the expense of epidermal fate, hence reducing the size of the foxi <dig> and dlx3b expression domains. additionally, foxi <dig> or dlx3b are not expressed ectopically as can happen after localized fgf misexpression  <cit> .

to provide further insight into the role of fgf <dig> signaling in foxi <dig> and dlx3b patterning, we treated wild-type embryos from late blastula stages until the end of gastrulation with su <dig>  a specific inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of all fgf receptors  <cit> . we find that su <dig>  at a concentration of  <dig> μm, blocks expression of the fgf-dependent gene, sprouty <dig>   indicating that inhibition is complete. nevertheless, expression of both foxi <dig> and dlx3b is unaffected by the inhibitor . these results show that fgf signaling is able to repress foxi <dig> and dlx3b expression but is not required for their initial activation.

early bmp signaling activates foxi <dig> directly and dlx3b indirectly
our fgf <dig> overexpression studies showed that foxi <dig> and dlx3b are negatively regulated in dorsal ectoderm by fgf signaling, raising the possibility that bmp signaling might activate these genes in the ventral ectoderm. in support of this idea, we find that neither foxi <dig> nor dlx3b is expressed in bmp2b mutants  and their expression is strongly reduced in bmp <dig> mutants . we also observe the same phenotype after knockdown of the ventralizing transcriptional repressors, vox and vent, by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides . furthermore, overexpression of bmp2b by mrna injection expands expression of foxi <dig> and dlx3b at the expense of anterior neural plate .

to learn whether foxi <dig> and dlx3b are direct transcriptional targets of bmp, we injected embryos at late blastula stages  with bmp2a protein and raised them in cycloheximide , a protein synthesis inhibitor. as a positive control, we examined expression of vent, a direct target of bmp signaling  <cit> . as expected, vent is ectopically expressed after bmp2a protein injection . control or bsa-injected embryos treated with chx have arrested gastrulation movements and do not exhibit vent expression . in chx-treated embryos injected with bmp2a protein, however, gastrulation movements are still blocked but vent expression is restored indicating that bmp2a protein is sufficient for vent expression and de novo protein synthesis is not required . both foxi <dig> and dlx3b behave similarly to vent with ectopic or missing expression after bmp2a protein injection or chx treatment, respectively . however, after bmp2a protein injection and chx treatment, foxi <dig> expression is restored, like vent, whereas dlx3b expression is not . thus, our results suggest that bmp signaling activates both foxi <dig> and dlx3b expression. furthermore, as early as sphere stage, foxi <dig>  but not dlx3b, acts as a direct transcriptional target of the bmp signaling pathway.

misexpression of fgf <dig> at late gastrulation stages leads to expanded induction of otic markers within the preotic field
to understand how overexpression of fgf <dig> at the end of gastrulation or early segmentation stages leads to the formation of much larger otic vesicles, we examined early markers of otic induction. first, to learn whether all cells receive the ectopic fgf signal, we examined expression of two fgf reporter genes, erm and pea <dig>  members of the ets family of transcription factors  <cit> . we find that within  <dig> minutes after a  <dig> minute heat shock at the end of gastrulation or during early segmentation stages, essentially all cells of the transgenic embryo respond to the ubiquitous fgf signal whereas non-transgenic siblings are unaffected . expression of foxi <dig> that is restricted to two bilateral domains at this stage is again reduced, whereas dlx3b expression surrounding the anterior neural plate is unchanged . this indicates that foxi <dig> but not dlx3b is presumably still under the control of bmp signaling that is attenuated by the anti-bmp activity of elevated fgf <dig> in heat shocked transgenic embryos. in contrast to the reduced foxi <dig> expression, we find that expression of the early preotic marker, pax <dig>  a paired box homeodomain gene, is expanded but only within the preotic region . in wild-type embryos at the one-somite stage, double labeling with both foxi <dig> and pax <dig> shows that preotic, fgf-dependent pax <dig> is expressed only in part of the foxi <dig> expression domain  <cit> . after exposure of the entire foxi1-positive domain to fgf <dig> in transgenic embryos, foxi <dig> protein, present prior to the heat shock, presumably persists and supports the observed expanded pax <dig> expression. because preotic pax <dig> expression depends completely on foxi <dig>  and foxi <dig> expression is restricted to two bilateral domains but is not expressed in other regions of the preplacodal domain at the end of gastrulation where we observe expanded pax <dig>  we also examined expression of pax2a, another early marker of otic fate. pax2a expression depends partially on foxi <dig> and partially on dlx3b that is expressed in a stripe corresponding to cells of the future neural plate border, which presumably represents the entire preplacodal domain  <cit> . as with pax <dig>  we detect expanded pax2a expression but again only in the preotic region of heat shocked, transgenic embryos . examination of sox9a expression  <cit> , a third early otic marker, yields identical results with upregulation of sox9a only in the preotic region but not in other regions of the preplacodal domain of transgenic embryos . together, these results show that cells only in the preotic region are competent to embark upon the path towards otic fate even if fgf signaling is strongly activated throughout the entire embryo.

ectopic otic cells undergo normal ear development
because the expression domains of pax <dig> and pax2a are expanded in the preotic region in the transgenic embryos, we examined whether these cells undergo normal development. we find that many more cells contribute to the otic placode in heat shocked, transgenic animals than in non-transgenic siblings . nevertheless, the otic vesicle subsequently forms with no overt morphological differences other than its increased size. both transgenic and non-transgenic embryos form two otolith seedlings and no size difference can be observed after three days of development . moreover, patterning of the otic vesicle developed normally as indicated by fgf <dig>  hmx <dig> and follistatin that demarcate anteroposterior domains, by dlx3b, otx <dig> and wnt <dig> in dorsoventral domains and by pax2a that highlights mediolateral domains at  <dig> h .

foxi <dig> and dlx3b both participate in expanded otic induction
because ectopic expression of pax <dig> and pax2a, in response to overexpression of fgf <dig>  is confined to the preotic region and overlaps with the expression domain of foxi <dig> but not dlx3b, it is possible that ectopic induction depends exclusively on foxi <dig>  we recently showed that depletion of foxi <dig> or dlx3b alone results in formation of a reduced otic vesicle and that removal of both factors leads to complete failure of otic specification  <cit> . we thus examined the response of embryos to fgf <dig> overexpression in the absence of either dlx3b or foxi <dig>  we find that overexpression of fgf <dig> at the end of gastrulation rescues the small otic vesicle generated by compromised dlx3b function . surprisingly however, we also detected partial rescue by misexpression of fgf <dig> in embryos depleted of foxi <dig> . consistent with our previous results  <cit> , we are unable to detect any sign of otic specification after loss of both factors, foxi <dig> and dlx3b, even if fgf signaling is significantly increased . taken together, our results show that either foxi <dig> or dlx3b is required for cells to be competent to respond to fgf <dig> signaling and subsequently form the ear. loss of either foxi <dig> or dlx3b can be partially compensated by an increase in fgf signaling, but removal of both leads to complete loss of otic fate.

ectopic foxi <dig> provides competence for ectopic fgf-dependent otic induction
to examine whether foxi <dig> expression is sufficient for cells to be competent to adopt an otic fate, we used several different approaches. misexpression of foxi <dig> by mrna or plasmid injections at the 1- to 2-cell stage in hsp:fgf <dig> embryos or transplantation of foxi <dig> positive cells into hsp:fgf <dig> host embryos followed by heat shock at late gastrulation stages were inconclusive . instead, we used retinoic acid  treatment to expand the foxi <dig> expression domain. application of high doses of ra  results in expansion of the hindbrain expression domains of fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> throughout the anterior neural plate and massive, fgf-dependent expansion of the pax <dig> expression domain  <cit> . we find that a much lower concentration of ra  is sufficient to expand pax <dig> expression around the anterior border of the neural plate . embryos treated with 20nm ra show no change in otx <dig>  fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> or sox9a expression, indicating that this ra concentration does not posteriorize the anterior neural plate or expand posterior expression domains . consistent with this, ra treated wild-type embryos show no loss of anterior structures but develop enlarged otic vesicles at  <dig> and  <dig> days of development . at the end of gastrulation, dlx3b expression in ra treated embryos is indistinguishable from untreated embryos , whereas the foxi <dig> expression domain is greatly expanded. we find that foxi <dig> is no longer limited to the two bilateral domains but instead expands into the entire preplacodal domain similar to the dlx3b stripe surrounding the anterior neural plate . in wild-type embryos, pax <dig> expression depends upon fgf signaling  <cit> , as confirmed by use of fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> double mutants . in fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> double mutants treated with ra, pax <dig> expression is greatly reduced, although we find some residual anterior expression , suggesting that a remaining fgf  may provide inductive signaling for pax <dig> expression in this region. in foxi <dig> mutants preotic pax <dig> expression is completely abolished, whereas in ra treated foxi <dig> mutants pax <dig> expression is largely gone, although surprisingly we find some residual expression at the anterior end . depletion of dlx3b and dlx4b by morpholino injections in ra-treated foxi <dig> mutants did not further reduce pax <dig> expression and we also could not detect any ectopic expression of the three known members of the zebrafish foxi class genes, foxi <dig>  foxi3a and foxi3b . the persistence of some residual pax <dig> expression in ra treated foxi <dig> mutant embryos indicates that additional genes might be involved in otic induction in the presence of ra. however taken together, our results show that most of the ectopic otic induction in ra treated embryos is due to the presence of ectopic foxi <dig> 

discussion
the competence of preotic cells to respond to fgf-signaling is acquired at the end of gastrulation
numerous loss of function and gain of function studies have led to the conclusion that fgf signaling is necessary and sufficient for induction of the otic placode, although not all cells are competent to respond to the inductive signal. our results add several pieces of evidence in support of our hypothesis  <cit>  that competence results from expression of foxi <dig> or dlx3b transcription factors: 1) cells become competent shortly after they start expressing the factors . 2) expanding the domain of fgf signaling extends otic fate to cells that express the factors but normally see only low levels of signal , but not to cells that never express the factors . 3) cells that ectopically express foxi <dig> acquire competence , whereas 4) cells that lose both factors lose competence , even when fgf signaling is elevated .

our results further show that there is only a relatively short time window for otic induction, between the end of gastrulation and early segmentation stages. misexpression of fgf <dig> only within this period leads to formation of enlarged otocysts whereas overexpression earlier or later results in smaller or unchanged otic vesicles . smaller otic vesicles after misexpression of fgf <dig> up to midgastrulation stages is presumably due to the effects of fgf signaling on dorsoventral patterning that subsequently affects expression of the foxi <dig> and dlx3b expression domains. fgf and bmp signals antagonistically control dorsoventral patterning of the embryo during gastrulation and are necessary to establish prospective neural and epidermal domains  <cit> . consistent with this interpretation, we see that ectopic fgf signaling leads to an expanded neural domain and a reduced epidermal domain . the reduction in size of the epidermal domain results in smaller foxi <dig> and dlx3b expression domains, and, hence, reduced numbers of cells that are competent to form the ear .

foxi <dig> and fgf signaling act together to regulate pax <dig> expression
transplantation experiments suggest that competence of naive ectoderm to form an otic placode is initially widespread during early gastrulation stages but becomes subsequently restricted to a relatively small area abutting the hindbrain at early segmentation stages  <cit> . the expression patterns of the foxi <dig> and dlx3b genes show similar progressive restrictions during early development consistent with the proposed roles of foxi <dig> and dlx3b proteins as the molecular regulators of otic competence  <cit> . expression of both foxi <dig> and dlx3b is initiated prior to or at the beginning of gastrulation throughout the future ventral side of the embryo. subsequently foxi <dig> expression is restricted to bilateral domains at the lateral edges of the hindbrain while dlx3b is restricted to a stripe of cells corresponding to the future neural plate border, including the preotic domain  <cit> . depletion of foxi <dig> or dlx3b leads to loss of otic tissue and the combined loss of both, dlx3b and foxi <dig>  ablates all indications of otic induction even in the presence of a functional fgf signaling pathway  <cit> . the changes in foxi <dig> and dlx3b expression after misexpression of fgf <dig> up to midgastrulation stages  foreshadows the loss of otic tissue, providing further evidence that these genes are required within the preotic region for otic induction. we never observe ectopic expression of foxi <dig> or dlx3b after misexpression of fgf <dig> and further demonstrate that foxi <dig> and dlx3b are positively regulated by bmp signaling but not fgf signaling .

these results contrast with a recent study that reported ectopic expression of foxi <dig> after fgf misexpression  <cit> . the conflicting results are presumably due to differences in the methods used to obtain ectopic fgf signaling. phillips et al.  <cit>  injected 8-cell stage embryos with plasmid dna encoding fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> under the control of a constitutive promoter. this leads to early variegated misexpression  <cit>  of fgf <dig> or fgf <dig>  with this technique, embryos exhibited some moderate dorsalization, but by co-labeling for neural markers and fgf expression, the authors ensured that the analyzed embryos had only scattered patches of fgf expressing cells and no overt signs of dorsalization. however, even with no overt signs of dorsalization, patchy activation of fgf signaling during gastrulation creates local dorsalizing centers that subsequently alter gastrulation movements resulting in the formation of a partial secondary axis  <cit> . use of our hsp:fgf <dig> transgenic line also changes dorsoventral identity but due to strong, uniform expression of fgf <dig> throughout the entire embryo, all cells are exposed to the same level of fgf signaling. consequently, no local dorsalizing center is created and no partial secondary axis is generated. furthermore, strong but relatively brief activation of the fgf signaling pathway in the hsp:fgf <dig> transgenic line presumably reveals the immediate, direct consequences of ectopic fgf signaling, whereas prolonged activation is known to affect dorsal ventral patterning, resulting in secondary effects.

additional support for our interpretation is provided by the complementary expression patterns of fgfs and foxi <dig>  in zebrafish, fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  fgf17b and fgf <dig> are all expressed in a dorsoventral gradient in the margin that later forms the germring of the gastrulating embryo, with highest levels on the dorsal side  <cit> . in contrast, foxi <dig> and dlx3b are strongly expressed on the ventral side. expression of the downstream targets of fgf signaling, sprouty <dig> and sprouty <dig>  is limited to the margin  <cit> , indicating that fgf signaling normally does not extend significantly into the ventral part of the embryo.

our findings have profound consequences for the placement of foxi <dig> in the genetic pathway regulating otic development. expression of foxi <dig> in the preotic region has been considered the earliest marker of otic induction  <cit> , but we show that foxi <dig> expression does not depend on fgf signaling, the inducer of otic fate. consistent with our previous model  <cit> , we propose instead that foxi <dig>  and fgf signaling  represent two independent pathways that act in concert to activate pax <dig>  which therefore is one of the earliest indicator of otic induction .

otic competence within the preplacodal region
misexpression of fgf <dig> at the end of gastrulation leads to ectopic otic induction in a foxi <dig> and dlx3b dependent manner, but only within the preotic region. treatment of wild-type embryos with ra, however, extends otic induction outside the normal preotic region to include the entire preplacodal domain that gives rise to all the cranial placodes. we show that most but not all of this ectopic otic induction is due to the misexpression of foxi <dig>  although misexpression of foxi <dig> promotes otic induction, the presence of foxi <dig> and dlx3b in non-neural cells alone is insufficient to initiate otic fate in response to fgf signaling. during gastrulation, foxi <dig> and dlx3b are co-expressed in cells on the ventral side of the embryo, but we never observe pax <dig> expression in these cells even when fgf is ectopically expressed in this region . however, at these stages the preplacodal domain, which represents the earliest stage of placode induction and which is required for otic induction  <cit> , has not yet been established. strong ventral bmp activity could be responsible for this limitation; a recent study suggests that attenuation of bmp signaling is required for formation of the preplacodal region  <cit> .

our results show that not only fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> can act as otic inducers; we still detect some otic induction in fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> double mutants treated with ra . candidates for this ectopic otic induction in the absence of fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> include fgf17a, fgf17b and fgf <dig> that are expressed at the anterior end of the embryo at bud stage  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together our results reconcile the conflicting reports of ectopic otic induction after misexpression of fgf. irrespective of the species, a region abutting the hindbrain is competent to adopt the otic fate by the end of gastrulation and until early segmentation stages. in zebrafish, this region of competence is defined by foxi <dig> and dlx3b whereas in other species, the network upstream of pax <dig> is still unknown. in chick, no foxi <dig> genes have been reported and in mouse foxi <dig> is expressed only very late during otic development, which might explain why disruption of foxi <dig> causes only a mild otic phenotype without affecting early patterning or morphogenesis  <cit> . recent analysis of mouse foxi class genes has revealed that foxi <dig> and foxi <dig> are expressed in the preotic region during otic induction  <cit> ; thus these factors may provide otic competence in mouse similar to foxi <dig> in zebrafish. at least one example of such a switch in function between orthologous genes in zebrafish and tetrapods has already been described  <cit>  supporting the notion that a genetic network similar to what we have proposed for zebrafish  <cit>  may regulate ear development in all vertebrates.
