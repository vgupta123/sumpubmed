BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death due to a single infectious agent. its success is based on perfect adaptation to the human host and the conditions prevailing in infected cells and tissues such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, low ph and the presence of antimicrobial substances. by adapting their gene expression, growth and metabolism to these environmental conditions, the bacteria are able to persist over long periods of time inside immune cells within granuloma in a latent state until possible reactivation and outbreak of disease. to be able to combat the disease, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating mycobacterial intracellular persistence, latency and reactivation.

a class of proteins implicated in regulating latency are the mycobacterial histone-like proteins   <cit> . hlp have been identified in pathogenic as well as environmental mycobacteria  <cit> . proteins belonging to this class have been given different designations in different mycobacterial species such as hlpmt or hupb in m. tuberculosis <cit> , mdp <dig>  in mycobacterium bovis bcg  <cit> , hlp in mycobacterium smegmatis <cit>  and ml-lbp <dig> in mycobacterium leprae <cit> . they are composed of an extremely basic c-terminal part homologous to eukaryotic histone h <dig> and an n-terminal region similar to hu from escherichia coli <cit> . hlp expression is developmentally regulated and up-regulation was observed in dormant m. smegmatis <cit>  and stationary cultures from m. bovis bcg  <cit> . it is an immunogenic protein detectable in tuberculosis patients  <cit> . hlp are nucleoid-associated proteins  <cit> , but have also been found to be surface-exposed  <cit> . they bind to dna  <cit>  preferring at-rich dna-sequences  <cit>  as well as to laminin, hyaluronic acid, heparin, and chondroitin sulphate  <cit> . the data available so far portray hlp as multi-faceted proteins, and accordingly a variety of possible functions have been ascribed to hlp. hlp were suggested to impact dna packaging, protection of dna from enzymatic and non-enzymatic strand breakage  <cit> , gene regulation  <cit> , nucleic acid metabolism, non-homologous-end-joining repair  <cit> , adaptation to hypoxic conditions  <cit> , induction of dormancy  <cit> , adaptation to cold shock  <cit> , adhesion  <cit> , cell wall biogenesis  <cit>  and regulation of growth rate  <cit> . a role in transition to the non-culturable state and in resuscitation from the non-culturable state was shown in m. smegmatis <cit> . whiteford et al.  <cit>  investigated the growth characteristics of an m. smegmatis with a deletion of hlp. they found that the mutant showed less aggregation in broth cultures. furthermore, they observed an increased sensitivity towards isoniazid. the m. smegmatis mutant also was affected in uv-resistance and resistance towards freezing/thawing. takatsuka et al.  <cit>  have recently shown that hlp has a similar activity to ferritin superfamily proteins and protects dna by ferroxidase activity. it furthermore captures iron molecules and functions as iron storage protein.

approaches to elucidate the functions of hlp by mutagenesis did not always confirm the expected roles of hlp  <cit> . our own attempts to generate a mdp <dig> deletion mutant had failed. furthermore and in line with our own experience, sassetti et al.  <cit>  had shown by high density mutagenesis that the gene rv2986c from m. tuberculosis, which is homologous to mdp <dig> from bcg, is required for optimal growth of m. tuberculosis. we therefore followed the strategy to analyse hlp functions by down-regulation of hlp expression by antisense-technique. advantages of this technique are the possibility to analyse essential genes and to repress genes present in several copies. in mycobacteria the antisense-technique has been applied to down-regulate ahpc from m. bovis <cit> , dnaa from m. smegmatis <cit> , fap-p from m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis <cit>  or pknf from m. tuberculosis <cit> . in a previous study we described the generation of the antisense-strain m. bovis bcg  which carries the plasmid pas-mdp <dig> causing a reduction of mdp <dig> expression in bcg by about 50%  <cit> . we analysed bcg  with respect to general growth characteristics. the down-regulated bcg grew faster in broth culture and achieved a higher cell mass in the stationary phase. similarly, growth was enhanced in human and murine macrophage-like cell lines. a further important finding was the reduced protein synthesis occurring under hypoxic conditions  <cit> . these findings support a role of mdp <dig> in growth regulation of m. bovis bcg. since we postulate the growth rate to be of major importance for virulence and intracellular persistence, we now investigated the role of mdp <dig> for the interaction of bcg with host cells during early phases of infection.

RESULTS
mdp <dig> is essential for adaptation of bcg to low ph
bacteria present in activated macrophages have to face low phagosomal ph conditions. we therefore tested the ability to adapt to low ph of m. bovis bcg, containing the empty cloning vector pmv <dig> , and of m. bovis bcg with the mdp1-antisense-plasmid pas-mdp <dig> , by comparing the growth without and with ph stress. bacteria were grown to optical density   <dig> , then diluted and inoculated into fresh middlebrook 7h <dig>  /oleic acid-dextrose-catalase  medium adjusted to ph  <dig> and ph  <dig> , respectively, and growth was monitored by measurement of od and atp content. as shown in figure 1a, bcg  reached a slightly higher od in medium with neutral ph in comparison to bcg  and also a higher maximal amount of atp . in medium adjusted to ph  <dig>  only bcg  was able to grow . the growth rate of bcg  in low ph medium was slightly below its growth rate in neutral medium if determined by od measurement. in medium adjusted to ph  <dig> bcg  grew to an od of  <dig>  after 42 days . in contrast the od of cultures grown in medium adjusted to ph  <dig>  was only  <dig>  after 42 days . the strain bcg  behaved very differently at low ph. it was not able to adapt to the low ph conditions and showed no growth at ph  <dig>  .

mdp <dig> plays a role in persistence of bcg in human blood monocytes
the alveolar macrophages represent the first line of defence the mycobacteria have to overcome in order to establish a successful long-lasting infection. we therefore analysed the ability of our bcg strains to survive in human blood monocytes. monocytes were infected with bcg  and bcg  grown to od  <dig> at an moi of  <dig> and the amount of intracellular bacteria was quantified one, two, three and five days after infection by quantitative real-time pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  the bcg with the empty plasmid started multiplying after one day post infection. after five days,  <dig>  times more cells of bcg  were present than after the initial infection period of four hours. in contrast, the bcg containing the mdp1-antisense-plasmid stayed relatively constant throughout the whole experiment. it only showed little growth between days two and three and otherwise decreased in number. mdp <dig> thus plays an important role for survival and growth of bcg in monocytes.

mdp <dig> affects the cytokine secretion of infected pbmc
the immune response against mycobacterial infections is coordinated by cytokines, and we therefore investigated cytokine expression of human pbmc induced by infection with bcg  compared to bcg . the pbmc were infected with the two strains at an moi of  <dig> and the amount of selected pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines  present in the supernatants was measured after  <dig> hours. negative controls consisted of uninfected cells, and positive controls were activated with lps and ifn-γ. all cytokines were induced upon activation with lps/ifn-γ and upon infection with mycobacteria . as shown in figure  <dig>  the down-regulation of mdp <dig> resulted in a decreased secretion of il-1β , ifn-γ , and il- <dig> . however, if means from all donors were calculated, only the reduction in il-1β secretion was statistically significant . the amount of il-1β in supernatants of pbmc infected with bcg  was only 41% of that in supernatants of pbmc infected with bcg . no effect was observed on the secretion of tnf-α .

mdp <dig> influences the rate of macrophage fusion
since the fusion of macrophages and the formation of multi-nucleated cells is one of the hallmarks of chronic infections associated with granuloma formation  <cit>  we were interested in analysing the effect of mdp <dig> on macrophage fusion. to this end we infected the mouse macrophage line raw <dig> , the human macrophage line mono mac  <dig>  and monocytes isolated from human blood with bcg  and bcg . uninfected cells served as negative controls and cells activated with lps and ifn-γ as positive controls. at different times after infection  the cells were stained with diff quick and the nuclei per cell were counted to determine the fusion index . ziehl-neelsen staining was performed to confirm uptake of mycobacteria by multi-nucleated cells .

the time course of fusion of human blood monocytes is shown in figure  <dig>  in uninfected human blood monocytes, very few multi-nucleated cells were present only after four days , while the infected cells and the positive controls had fused already at day three . at day four, clear differences were visible between the different experimental settings . the uninfected control had formed only very few fused cells with only three nuclei , while the infected cells had produced more fused macrophages with a much higher number of nuclei . in figure 4e , for example, up to nine nuclei per cell are visible, and in figure 4h  up to  <dig> nuclei per cell can be counted. at this time point the lps/ifn-γ-stimulated blood monocytes had also formed fused cells, but additionally cell aggregates were formed, which were not visible in the other experimental settings . eleven days after infection cells had enlarged, and with the exception of the negative control the fusion process had proceeded. the fusion indexes of blood monocytes 11 days after infection are shown in table  <dig>  the bcg strain down-regulated with respect to mdp <dig> expression depicted a fusion index of  <dig> % which was  <dig>  times higher than the fusion index induced by bcg with the empty vector pmv <dig> . especially at early time points most of the nuclei were arranged in a circle at the outer rim of the monocytes and depicted the morphology typical of the langhans cells present in tuberculous lesions  <cit> .

a moi = multiplicity of infection .

the fusion process in the macrophage cell lines raw <dig>  and mm <dig> was followed over a shorter time of up to five days, because of experimental limitations due to multiplication of the cells. the results obtained with primary human blood monocytes could be confirmed by the use of the two cell lines. as shown in table  <dig> raw <dig>  infected with bcg  had formed  <dig>  times more multi-nucleated cells after five days than raw <dig>  infected with bcg . the cell line mm <dig> presented  <dig>  times more multi-nucleated cells after infection with bcg  than after infection with the reference strain three days after infection . the different cell types varied with respect to maximal fusion indexes reached. upon infection with bcg , for example, raw <dig>  achieved the highest fusion index with  <dig> % followed by human blood monocytes with  <dig> %. the lowest fusion activity was observed with mm <dig> cells that only reached a fusion index of  <dig> % . the different types of monocytes furthermore differed with respect to the morphology of the fused cells . the morphology typical of langhans cells characterised by nuclei arranged in a circle along of the periphery of the cell was only present in human blood monocytes . raw <dig>  cells were shaped more irregularly, and the nuclei were concentrated in the central part of the cells . multi-nucleated mm <dig> cells were strongly enlarged, round, and the nuclei were spread relatively evenly across the cells .

the fusion process then was analysed in-depth by calculating the fusion indexes with respect to the number of nuclei per cell. figure  <dig> is a graphic illustration of the distribution of the fusion indexes in the cell line raw <dig> . the uninfected cells generated multi-nucleated cells up to only seven nuclei per cell. up to eight nuclei per fused cell were present in raw <dig>  infected with bcg . much more fused cells with much higher numbers of nuclei were present in the lps/ifn-γ-activated cells as well as in cells infected with bcg . the highest number of nuclei per cell was found in cells infected with bcg  with  <dig> nuclei per fused macrophage. from this illustration it is obvious that the fusion rates of strain bcg  were more similar to those of uninfected cells, while the fusion rates of strain bcg  resembled more those of cells activated with lps and ifn-γ.

discussion
a large number of different functions have been proposed for the mdp <dig> protein from m. bovis bcg, but its role in infection has not been fully elucidated so far. to better understand its role in infection, we investigated its influence in very early stages of infection, and gave particular attention to its interactions with blood-derived immune cells. our studies were performed with a bcg strain down-regulated with respect to expression of mdp <dig> by antisense-technique  and a control strain containing the empty vector without antisense-construct . by using bcg  as control, we have ensured that the tested strain and the control strain only differ by the presence of the antisense-sequence. different reactions of the two strains can therefore be attributed to the antisense-sequence. this is supported by our experiments with other bcg genes and antisense-sequences also cloned into pmv <dig>  which generated different results depending on the inserted sequence . it therefore can be concluded that the inserted sequences and not the vector or additional rna accumulation are responsible for the differing phenotypes of control and test strains.

when mycobacteria are ingested into and reside in macrophages, they are exposed to an environment characterised by decreasing ph from around  <dig>  in resting macrophages to around  <dig>  in activated macrophages and below  <dig>  in phagolysosomes  <cit> . accordingly we started by investigating the resistance to low ph of our two strains. the growth was monitored in broth adjusted to either ph  <dig> or  <dig> , the latter corresponding to the ph present in activated macrophages. although bcg  grew better at ph  <dig> than bcg , the reduction of the mdp <dig> protein caused an inability of these mycobacteria to adapt to low ph, resulting in complete absence of growth at ph  <dig>  .

this remarkable sensitivity towards low ph of bcg down-regulated in mdp <dig> expression might be an obstacle for an intra-phagosomal lifestyle, and we consequently investigated intracellular growth of the two strains in human blood-derived monocytes. we quantified intracellular bcg by real-time pcr, because we found this method more precise than colony counting. on the one hand, dna quantification is not that much affected by clumping of bcg and presence of viable but non-culturable cells, on the other hand this method bears the risk of including dead bacteria. in a study of barrera and colleagues  <cit> , it was, however, shown that quantification of growth of intracellular bcg within macrophages during four days by a pcr method yielded results equivalent to those obtained by cfu counting or measurement of uracil incorporation. again, the bcg  showed no growth while bcg  was able to multiply inside the monocytes . mdp <dig> thus plays a major role in intracellular survival, perhaps by enabling the bacteria to adapt to conditions present in the phagosomes such as low ph. further experiments such as blocking of phagosome acidification or investigation of the presence and function of vatpase in the phagosome membrane are required to confirm a functional relationship between the influence of mdp <dig> on low ph tolerance and intracellular replication. in previous experiments, using cell lines  instead of primary blood cells, we had made observations diverging from the results reported in this study. in those cell lines the mdp1-down-regulated strain showed better growth than the control strain  <cit> . there are several possible explanations for the different outcomes of infections of the cell lines versus blood monocytes. one plausible explanation is that primary monocytes on the one hand and cell lines on the other hand dispose of very different properties. it was shown that cell lines such as mm <dig>  u- <dig> or thp- <dig> correspond to immature monocytes expressing biochemical markers characteristic of immature cells in monocyte development, which are not expressed by peripheral blood monocytes. correspondingly, markers expressed at high levels in mature monocytes  were not expressed or expressed at low levels in these cell lines  <cit> . deregulation of immune signalling may also occur in cell lines. the cell line j774a. <dig>  for instance, continuously synthesizes il-1β . such properties may affect the mycobactericidal activity of cell lines compared to primary blood monocytes. in contrast to the cell line cultures which consisted of only one cell type, namely the mm <dig> or j774a. <dig> cells, our blood monocyte preparations which were purified by ficoll/percoll gradient centrifugation contained about 70% monocytes and about 30% cd14-negative cells . the latter fraction contained cells such as cd4-positive ifn-γ-secreting lymphocytes able to activate monocytes. an activation of the primary monocytes by ifn-γ-producing cells may have intensified the bactericidal activity of blood-derived monocytes compared to the cell lines.

infection with m. bovis bcg  caused a lesser activation of pbmc than infection with bcg , as is evident from the cytokine expression of infected pbmc:  <dig> hours after infection the pro-inflammatory cytokine il1-β was secreted at significantly lower amounts upon infection with the antisense-strain . ifn-γ as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> were also secreted at lower amounts, but due to donor variation no significance was obtained for the latter cytokines if the mean of all donors was calculated. the expression of these cytokines is mediated via binding of pathogen molecules to toll-like receptors  located on the plasma and/or phagosome membranes. among the tlr, tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are responsible for recognising m. tuberculosis. tlr <dig> is activated by heat shock proteins 60/ <dig>  <cit> . the heterodimers tlr2/tlr <dig> and tlr2/tlr <dig> can recognise mycobacterial lipoproteins. tlr2/tlr <dig> also bind mycobacterial cell wall glycolipids including lipoarabinomannan, lipomannan and phosphatidylinositol mannoside  <cit>  and a role of mdp <dig> in cell wall synthesis has been proposed by katsube et al.  <cit> . cpg containing dna represents the ligand of tlr <dig>  <cit> . an influence of mdp <dig> on tlr <dig> signalling has been shown by matsumoto  <cit>  who proved that addition of mdp <dig> protein to cpg dna enhances the tlr9-dependent immune stimulation of this dna resulting in increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the latter finding is in line with our observation of reduced synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines after infection with the mdp <dig> down-regulated bcg. in addition to tlr, the cytosolic nucleotide-binding and oligomerisation domain-like receptors such as nod <dig> and nod <dig> are able to bind pathogen ligands and activate cytokine expression through nf-κb. signalling through nod <dig> seems to require intracellular metabolically active bacteria  <cit> . therefore, reduced cytokine secretion upon infection with the mdp1-antisense-strain may also be related to the reduced intracellular growth of this strain.

the interplay of cytokines secreted upon infection with mycobacterium effects an attraction of immune cells to the site of infection, finally ending in the formation of granuloma. multi-nucleated macrophages  resulting from macrophage fusion reside in the middle of these structures and are considered to be hallmarks of granuloma. mgc are unable to phagocytose additional mycobacteria due to decreased expression of phagocytosis receptors. their role seems to be to destroy mycobacteria that have been ingested by less differentiated macrophages and monocytes and to present mycobacterial antigens  <cit> . lay et al.  <cit>  showed that the maximal number of nuclei per fused macrophage depended on the infecting mycobacterial species, although all tested mycobacteria were able to induce granuloma formation. m. tuberculosis was able to induce mgc containing  <dig> and more nuclei per cell, while less pathogenic or opportunistic mycobacteria such as m. bovis bcg, m. microtim. aviumm. kansasiim. smegmatis or m. phlei only induced the formation of multi-nucleated cells containing up to seven nuclei per cell. we therefore wanted to find out whether mdp <dig> played a role in fusion of infected macrophages and had an influence on the differentiation of macrophages. our experiments showed that in all cell types tested, including human blood monocytes as well as cell lines such as mm <dig> and raw <dig> , the bcg expressing less mdp <dig> induced a much higher rate of macrophage fusion . in raw <dig> , for example, we counted up to eight nuclei per fused cell upon infection with bcg containing the empty vector pmv <dig> . this result is very similar to the results of lay et al.  <cit>  who reported that bcg-infected human macrophages contained up to seven nuclei per fused cell. when we infected raw <dig>  with bcg , we observed up to  <dig> nuclei per cell, which is close to the  <dig> nuclei per cell reported by lay et al.  <cit>  to occur upon infection of human cells with virulent m. tuberculosis. lay and colleagues have related lack of the chromosomal regions including the rd <dig> region in m. bovis bcg and m. microti compared to m. tuberculosis to their reduced mgc-inducing ability. our results clearly show that mdp <dig> also plays a role in mgc formation.

CONCLUSIONS
multiple functions have been assigned to the mdp <dig> protein, but its precise role during the infection process has yet to be determined. we have investigated the influence of mdp <dig> on early events of infection. mdp <dig> was revealed to be crucial for adaptation to low ph, intracellular multiplication, induction of cytokine secretion and induction of macrophage fusion with generation of multi-nucleated langhans cells. the latter being the hallmark of granuloma and chronic infection, our results support an important role of mdp <dig> in persistent infection.
