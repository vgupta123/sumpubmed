BACKGROUND
enterobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogen associated with the ingestion of reconstituted infant formula, and is a rare cause of neonatal meningitis, necrotising enterocolitis  and sepsis  <cit> . these cases often occur among low-birth weight preterm neonates, who are generally more susceptible to gram-negative bacterial sepsis and endotoxemia which is associated with nec  <cit> . the bacterium can persist under desiccated conditions in infant formula for over two years  <cit> . there have been a number of reported e. sakazakii outbreaks which have been attributed to reconstituted infant formula which may be contaminated at source or during preparation  <cit> . the virulence of e. sakazakii has been studied by pagotto et al.  <cit>  and mange et al.  <cit>  who showed the presence of enterotoxins and adhesion to brain cells, respectively. the influence of endotoxin on increased translocation of intestinal bacteria and e. sakazakii in the neonatal rat was demonstrated by townsend et al.  <cit> . recently, townsend et al.  <cit>  comparatively investigated several e. sakazakii strains showing chronic-patterned brain inflammation in neonatal rats following intracranial inoculation. these studies further demonstrated the ability of e. sakazakii to invade brain capillary endothelial cells and persist in human macrophages. the il-10/il- <dig> ratio secreted by these macrophages was high and suggests a type  <dig> immune response may be activated early during e. sakazakii infection that is inadequate to clear the infection  <cit> . previously, we reported a nicu outbreak in which  <dig> neonates were infected, and  <dig> neonates died  <cit> . three distinguishable e. sakazakii pulsotypes were isolated from neonates and reconstituted formula. a fourth pulsotype was isolated from an unopened tin of powdered infant formula. pulsotype  <dig> was associated with the three deaths, and therefore was potentially more virulent. a pulsotype is determined by pulsed field electrophoresis  and refers to strains which are not distinguishable by treatment with rare cutting dna restriction enzymes. however, some strains in pulsotype  <dig> possessed extended spectrum beta-lactamase activities, and therefore some genetic variability existed between these strains. a summary of the e. sakazakii pulsotypes and neonates is given in table  <dig>  previous publications have not reported the individual case details associated with the isolates under study. therefore, it is not possible to directly consider correlations between in vitro and in vivo studies. this is the first report studying in vitro virulence assays using clinical isolates with associated patient details, symptoms and outcomes.

a strains demonstrated extended spectrum β-lactamase activities.

b nec stage ii  is characterised by the systemic signs of temperature instability, apnoea, bradycardia, lethargy with additional symptoms of absence of bowel sounds, radiological signs of intestinal dilation, ileus and pneumatosis intestinalis. nec stage iii  is where the neonate is critically ill with metabolic acidosis, neutropenia, signs of generalised peritonitis, marked tenderness and distension of abdomen.

RESULTS
in vitro virulence determination
the attachment and invasion of caco- <dig> human epithelial cells was determined after a 3-h exposure period with strains from each e. sakazakii pulsotype and the e. cloacae strain  <dig> from the outbreak. s. enteritidis, a well documented enteric pathogen capable of attaching and invading caco- <dig> cells was used as a positive control. pulsotype  <dig>  attached  more than other pulsotypes and s. enteritidis, , which was the positive control . pulsotype  <dig> strains  associated less with epithelial cells  than s. enteritidis. strains from pulsotypes  <dig>  and  <dig>  also attached, at relatively low values  compared with s. enteritidis but greater than the e. coli k <dig> negative control . e. cloacae strain  <dig> attached to caco- <dig> cells more abundantly  than s. enteritidis and the e. sakazakii strains. all strains showed significantly more attachment than e. coli k <dig>  and significantly more or less than s. enteritidis .

all strains invaded caco- <dig> cells at a significantly  greater value than e. coli k <dig> , and less than s. enteritidis . strains  <dig> and  <dig> invaded at higher values,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of inoculum , respectively than the other e. sakazakii strains . while not statistically different, there did appear to be an apparent difference between strains  <dig> and  <dig> with s. enteritidis.

after  <dig> h within u <dig> macrophages, significantly higher numbers of intracellular e. sakazakii were recovered from strains  <dig>  a pulsotype  <dig>  from a fatal nec case and  <dig>  a pulsotype  <dig> isolated from powdered infant formula , than other e. sakazakii strains . all e. sakazakii strains persisted and were recovered from macrophages at detectable levels at  <dig> h. in contrast to the e. sakazakii strains, there was significantly less uptake and persistence of e. cloacae strain  <dig> in u <dig> macrophages. at  <dig> h, the number of e. cloacae recovered was significantly less  than the e. sakazakii strains and was not detectable after  <dig> h.

e. sakazakii is associated with rare cases of bacterial meningitis. therefore, we carried out an in vitro study to investigate the ability of e. sakazakii to invade capillary endothelial cells which comprise the blood-brain barrier. e. sakazakii strains from the  <dig> pulsotypes were used for invasion studies of rat brain capillary endothelial cells . invasion was evaluated after inoculation  and gentamicin treatment . the e. coli k <dig> negative control did not invade this cell line . however, e. sakazakii strain  <dig> invaded rbcec <dig> cells significantly more than e. sakazakii strains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and e. cloacae strain  <dig> . strain  <dig> was from the fatal meningitis case . e. sakazakii strain  <dig> invaded rbcec <dig> cells significantly more than e. sakazakii strains  <dig>   <dig> and e. cloacae strain  <dig> . thus, on average, strains  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were the most invasive. furthermore, all strains tested  had p values  not significantly different from invasive meningitic e. coli k <dig> positive control.

discussion
the strains in this study were from the largest reported outbreak of e. sakazakii in a nicu, with the most deaths, that has been reported to-date  <cit> . in addition, it is the first report comparing in vitro virulence assays of clinical isolates with associated patient details and clinical symptoms.

e. sakazakii is associated with nec, bacteraemia, sepsis and meningitis. therefore, attachment to intestinal cells and translocation to systemic tissue are important in the pathogenesis of the organism. variations in symptoms for each pulsotype could have varied according to dose, neonate age and antibiotic administration. however, pulsotype  <dig> appeared to be more virulent than pulsotypes  <dig> and  <dig> based on the number of nec, septicaemia, meningitis and fatal cases. in addition, strains  <dig> and  <dig> in pulsotype  <dig> acquired extended spectrum β-lactamase activity  <cit> . it is accepted that other unidentified factors could have contributed to the number of neonatal cases and severity of infection, such as duration of exposure.

the attachment of e. sakazakii strains to caco- <dig> cells after a 3-h exposure period was greater than the negative control  e. coli k <dig> . strain  <dig>  attached to a greater extent than the positive control s. enteritidis . strain  <dig>  was from an asymptomatic case and showed lower attachment values than the e. sakazakii strains which had caused nec, and meningitis. the attachment of strain  <dig>  from powdered infant formula, was significantly  higher than  <dig> and  <dig>  and similar to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  e. cloacae strain  <dig> showed the greatest attachment value . there was no direct correlation between attachment and invasion rates of caco- <dig> cells. for example, strains  <dig> and  <dig> had the highest attachment rates, yet  <dig> and  <dig> had the highest invasion rates . all e. sakazakii strains and e. cloacae showed similar potential for invasion. strains  <dig> and  <dig>  associated with fatal cases of nec and meningitis, showed the highest invasion rates . this suggests that the ability to invade intestinal cells may be a strong indication of potential virulence and poor outcome in the neonatal host.

most e. sakazakii strains persisted in macrophages for  <dig> h. strains  <dig>  and  <dig>  multiplied significantly in the first  <dig> h. persistence and replication within macrophages suggests that e. sakazakii possess virulence mechanisms to withstand the bactericidal activities within macrophages and evade the host immune response. controls for macrophage persistence , killing , and replication  comparatively showed that e. sakazakii strains could persist within macrophages for at least  <dig> h and some strains demonstrated moderate  to high  levels of replication. in contrast to the e. sakazakii strains, there was either no uptake of e. cloacae  by u <dig> macrophage cells, or it was rapidly killed following macrophage uptake.

e. sakazakii is associated with rare cases of bacterial meningitis. therefore, the ability to invade cells comprising the blood-brain barrier was investigated using rat brain capillary endothelial cell line rbcec <dig>  e. coli k <dig> and c. freundii have been tested in both human brain microvascular endothelial cells  and rbcec <dig> cells and show similar levels of invasion, supporting the use of rbcec <dig> cells as a model of bbb cell invasion  <cit> . the e. sakazakii strains and e. cloacae  <dig> were able to invade rat brain cells at similar levels as e. coli k <dig> . e. coli k <dig> is known to cause acute bacterial meningitis in neonates and further demonstrates the virulence potential of e. sakazakii for this host site. e. sakazakii is invasive for capillary endothelial cells and may gain access to the brain via crossing the normally impenetrable blood-brain barrier with specific virulence mechanisms  <cit> .

the four pulsotypes have been previously described with respect to source, patient symptoms, and phenotypic traits  <cit> . pulsotype  <dig> strains were isolated from an unopened tin of powdered infant formula and were not associated with any neonatal infections. it is notable that pulsotype  <dig> strains showed no protease activity on skimmed milk agar plates or capsule production. whether these phenotypes are related to virulence determinants is unknown, but are under current investigation.

the outcome of infection due to e. sakazakii will be dependent upon a number of factors such as birth weight, age, immune status and antibiotic therapy  <cit> . in our study, it was not possible to directly correlate clinical symptoms and outcomes with in vitro studies. nevertheless, we have shown the invasive potential of e. sakazakii with intestinal and blood-brain barrier cells. in addition, e. sakazakii was able to persist and even replicate for a period within macrophage cells. these traits appear to facilitate host immune evasion and dissemination. in addition, e. sakazakii can acquire antibiotic resistance during infection, as shown by the acquisition of extended spectrum β-lactamase activities by strains  <dig> and  <dig>  these two strains were isolated from two neonates, one month apart . there was variation within pulsotype  <dig> for attachment and invasion of intestinal and blood-brain barrier cells. whether this reflected the variation in patient symptoms is uncertain. but it is notable that strain  <dig> had the highest level of endothelial cell invasion, greater than e. coli k <dig>  and was isolated from a fatal meningitis case, the outcome of which could have been influenced detrimentally by the extended β-lactamase spectrum activity the strain had acquired due to its resistance to standard antibiotic therapy.

strain  <dig> was initially identified as e. sakazakii and was isolated from a fatal case of septic shock during the period of the nicu e. sakazakii outbreak . however, recent 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed it was e. cloacae  <cit> . this strain showed attachment, and invasion of caco- <dig> endothelial cells, no invasion or no survival in macrophages, and low invasion of rat brain capillary endothelial cells. therefore, it had the ability to attach and invade intestinal cells, but no propensity for macrophage survival or dissemination, nor an ability to invade the brain. it had however been able to enter to bloodstream and cause fatal septic shock.

the potential attachment and invasion of host tissue, dissemination and invasion of the blood-brain barrier have been investigated and demonstrated the potential of e.  <dig> sakazakii to infect exposed neonates. the source of the three pulsotypes could not definitely be attributed to contaminated reconstituted infant formula. nevertheless the feeding practices of preparation for 24-h periods, and prolonged  administration could have enabled bacterial growth in the reconstituted formula and increased the risk of infection.

CONCLUSIONS
while variables such as host factors and treatment strategies determine the outcome of infection, our in vitro studies evaluated the virulence of the isolates associated with this outbreak. it was not possible to directly correlate clinical symptoms and outcomes with in vitro studies. nevertheless, we have shown the variation in invasive potential of e. sakazakii with intestinal and blood-brain barrier cells between and within pulsotypes from a neonatal intensive care unit outbreak. e. sakazakii strains were able to persist and even replicate for a period within macrophage cells. these traits appear to facilitate host immune evasion and dissemination.
