BACKGROUND
accumulated evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide  generated in cells during insulin stimulation plays an integral role in insulin receptor signal transduction  <cit> . specific molecular targets of h2o <dig> identified to date include the insulin receptor kinase  <cit> , protein tyrosine phosphatases   <cit> , and the lipid phosphatase pten  <cit> , whose activity is modified via oxidative reactions with h2o <dig>  two distinct insulin-sensitive cellular h2o <dig> sources have been identified. a membrane-bound nadph-oxidase is involved in insulin-induced h2o <dig> production in adipocytes  <cit>  and vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit> . the mitochondrial respiratory chain is implicated in insulin-induced h2o <dig> generation in liver and heart  <cit> . there are experimental data that insulin-induced reactive oxygen species  and h2o <dig> play a role in the activation of insulin signaling in neuroblastomas  <cit> . however, the role of insulin-induced h2o <dig> in neuronal insulin receptor activation and the origin of insulin-induced h2o <dig> in neurons remain unclear.

the aim of the present study is to test the following hypotheses  whether insulin-induced h2o <dig> is required for insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons, and  whether mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production, thus playing an integral role in insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.

RESULTS
insulin-induced h2o <dig> is required for the enhancement of the insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons
to examine whether insulin stimulates h2o <dig> production in cultured cerebellar granule neurons , we measured h2o <dig> accumulation for  <dig> min in the incubation medium of cgn cultures, in the absence or presence of insulin. for h2o <dig> detection, an extremely sensitive assay based on fluorescence of resorufin, a product of a 1: <dig> stoichiometric reaction of amplex red dye with h2o <dig>  was used. as shown in figure 1a, insulin stimulation elicited a marked increase in h2o <dig> release from cgn to a level of  <dig> Â±  <dig> nmol/l, although the basal h2o <dig> release from cgn cultures was below the assay detection limit .

to determine whether insulin-induced h2o <dig> is involved in the enhancement of insulin receptor autophosphorylation, we next studied the effects of n-acetylcysteine , a h2o <dig> scavenger, on the insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor in cgn. as shown in figure 1a, the pre-incubation of cgn with nac abolished the insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> release from cells to undetectable levels , indicating that nac is a potent scavenger of insulin-induced h2o <dig> under these experimental conditions. figure 1b shows that pre-incubation of cgn with nac resulted in the significant inhibition of insulin-stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation . these results suggest that insulin-induced h2o <dig> is required for the enhancement of insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.

the mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production, thus playing an integral role in the insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons
to reveal whether mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in the insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production in neurons, we measured h2o <dig> release from cgn cultures in the absence or presence of insulin and two inhibitors of respiratory chain-mediated h2o <dig> production, malonate and carbonyl cyanide-4--phenylhydrazone . as shown in figure 2a, both malonate and fccp completely abolished insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> release from cgn. both malonate and fccp had no effect on basal h2o <dig> production in cgn. these data indicate that mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> generation in neurons.

to examine whether mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons, we assessed the effects of inhibitors of respiratory chain-mediated h2o <dig> production, malonate and fccp, and a respiratory substrate, dicholine salt of succinic acid , on the insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor in primary cgn cultures. whereas by itself, malonate, fccp, and cs had no effect on the basal autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor, they significantly influenced the insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin receptor. as shown in figure 2b, both malonate and fccp significantly inhibited the insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor . figure  <dig> shows that cs significantly enhanced the effect of suboptimal concentration of  <dig> nmol/l insulin on insulin receptor autophosphorylation . these data suggest that mitochondrial respiratory chain plays an integral role in insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.

discussion
insulin signaling requires the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor kinase at tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the kinase domain  <cit> . upon autophosphorylation, the receptor undergoes a major conformational change resulting in unrestricted access of protein substrates and atp to the kinase active site and an approximate two-order increase in kinase activity  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate that n-acetylcysteine, the h2o <dig> scavenger, inhibits both insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> generation and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation in cgn. these results suggest that insulin-induced h2o <dig> is required for the enhancement of insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.

we found that mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production, thus playing an integral role in insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons. mitochondrial respiration is a major cellular source of h2o <dig> that may convert up to 2% of total oxygen consumption into h2o <dig> in state  <dig> respiration  with succinate as a respiratory substrate  <cit> . among other respiratory substrates, the complex ii substrate succinate provides the highest rates of mitochondrial h2o <dig> generation in brain mitochondria  <cit> . molecular mechanisms of h2o <dig> production in mitochondria are the subject of intense ongoing research. the respiratory chain reduces oxygen to superoxide anion, which dismutates to h2o <dig> spontaneously or by the action of superoxide dismutase  <cit> . although mitochondria produce h2o <dig> in all metabolic states, high mitochondrial membrane potential  characteristic to the resting  respiration significantly promotes h2o <dig> generation  <cit> . substances that decrease , e.g. malonate and fccp, inhibit h2o <dig> generation  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate that inhibitors of respiratory chain-mediated h2o <dig> production, malonate and the protonophore fccp, inhibit both insulin-induced h2o <dig> generation and insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation in neurons. the respiratory substrate succinate, taken in form of dicholine salt of succinic acid, significantly enhances the stimulatory effect of suboptimal insulin concentration on insulin receptor autophosphorylation. these results, together with our observations that the h2o <dig> scavenger  inhibited both insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> generation and insulin receptor autophosphorylation, suggest that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production, thus playing an integral role in insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.

our prior studies provide evidence that a transient activation of succinate dehydrogenase  is a mode by which insulin increases the rate of mitochondrial h2o <dig> generation  <cit> . earlier, it has been demonstrated that insulin exhibits an immediate stimulatory effect on oxidation of -succinate in mitochondrial krebs cycle, which is almost maximal within  <dig> sec  <cit> . the results of the present study are consistent with these findings. malonate, a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, inhibits both insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production and the receptor phosphorylation in neurons, indicating a role of sdh in these processes. although signaling pathways regulating insulin-stimulated sdh activation remain to be elucidated, these pathways seem to be distinct from those induced by autophosphorylated form of insulin receptor. the reason for it is that insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> burst enhances the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor, since inhibitors of insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> generation abolish the receptor autophosphorylation.

a large body of evidence has accumulated that impairments in cerebral insulin receptor signaling may contribute to age-related cognitive decline and alzheimer's disease  <cit> . in this context, our findings identify mitochondrial respiratory chain as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of disorders associated with dysfunctional insulin receptor signal transduction in neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
results of the present study suggest that insulin-induced h2o <dig> is required for the enhancement of insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons. the mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production, thus playing an integral role in insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.
