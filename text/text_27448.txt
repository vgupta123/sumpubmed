BACKGROUND
camellia, comprising more than  <dig> species, is an economically and phylogenetically important genus in the family theaceae
 <cit> . besides the abundance in phenotypic and species diversity, increasing attention has been paid to the genus, as they include several economically important members of their commercial and ornamental values. one of the most economic values of camellia is the production of tea made from the young leaves of c. sinensis var. sinensis and c. sinensis var. assamica in the section thea. the other most economically important species is c. oleifera, which has the longest history of cultivation and utilization in china for edible oil used primarily in cooking. many other species of the genus camellia were also used locally for seed oil production, such as c. reticulata <cit> . moreover, the camellia species are of great ornamental values, particularly represented by c. japonica, c. reticulata and c. sasanqua.

as a result of frequent hybridization and polyploidization, camellia is taxonomically and phylogenetically regarded as one of the most challengingly difficult taxa in plants. traditional classification of species using a morphology-based system is often dynamic and unreliable, which is often affected by environmental factors. the lack of suitable dna fragments and polymorphic genetic markers for phylogenic analysis have long obstructed the availability of a reliable phylogeny, adding the controversies about taxonomic classification that prevent us from better understanding the diversification and evolution of the genus camellia. by using amplified fragment length polymorphisms 
 <cit> , simple sequence repeats 
 <cit> , random amplified polymorphic dna 
 <cit> , inter-simple sequence repeat 
 <cit> , internal transcribed spacer 
 <cit>  and several dna loci
 <cit> , a number of previous studies gave further insights into the taxonomy and phylogeny of the camellia species but still have not reached a satisfied resolution. a recent effort using whole chloroplast  genome sequences of six camellia species has generated useful data but still failed to determine their phylogenetic relationships, not agreeing with any taxonomic treatments
 <cit> .

the cp genomes could provide valuable information for taxonomic classification and the reconstruction of phylogeny as a result of sequence divergence between plant species and individuals. owing to the absence of recombination and maternal transmission, the cp genomes are helpful for tracing source populations
 <cit>  and phylogenetic studies of higher plants for resolving complex evolutionary relationships
 <cit> . it is particularly true for the case of camellia, given its confusing phylogenetic relationships with large nuclear genomes
 <cit> . cp-derived markers, e.g. rpl <dig> gene, psba-trnh, trnl-f and rpl32-trnl intergenic spacer , were employed to study evolutionary relationships between tea plants
 <cit> . repetitive sequences within the cp genomes are also potentially useful for ecological and evolutionary studies of plants
 <cit> . not only will the information from cp genomes be useful for studying the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships, but it will also facilitate cp transformation in the economically important plants. the next-generation sequencing techniques have revolutionized dna sequencing via high-throughput capabilities but relatively low costs. as it is now more convenient to obtain cp genome sequences and promptly extend gene-based phylogenetics to phylogenomics.

in this study, we sequenced the  <dig> camellia chloroplast genomes using next-generation illumina genome analyzer platform. the sequenced camellia species included up to  <dig> species and varieties  from sect. thea with an emphasis of these species belonging to the section. three representative species were additionally sampled, each from sect. camellia, sect. corallina and sect. archecamellia, respectively. this study aims to examine global patterns of structural variation of the camellia cp genomes and reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among the representative species. the complete cp genome sequences of camellia reported here are prerequisite for classifying the ‘difficult taxa’ and modifying these important economic plants by chloroplast genetic engineering techniques.

RESULTS
chloroplast genome sequencing and assembly
using illumina genome analyzer platform, we sequenced cp genomes of seven species and three varieties from sect. thea, and each from sect. archecamellia, corallina and camellia, respectively . the three cp genomes of c. sinensis var. assamica, c. oleifera and c. taliensis <cit>  were used in our study with a minor revision by the two following steps: 1) assembled and manually checked more carefully; 2) pcr were used with high fidelity polymerase to verify the sequences in the four junctions. and then the revised c. sinensis var. assamica was employed as a reference while assembling the  <dig> sequenced cp genomes. illumina paired-end  sequencing produced large data sets for individual species.  <dig> , <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig>  paired-end reads were mapped to the reference cp genome of c. sinensis var. assamica, reaching  <dig> to 711 × coverage on average across these cp genomes. after de novo and reference-guided assembly as in
 <cit>  with minor modifications, we obtained eight complete cp genomes and five draft cp genomes . the four junction regions for each resulting cp genome were validated by using pcr-based sequencing with four pairs of primers . these genome sequences were deposited into the genbank under accession numbers  .

conservation of camellia chloroplast genomes
all eight complete camellia cp genomes were composed of single circular double-stranded dna molecules. they displayed the typical quadripartite structure of most angiosperms, including the large single copy , the small single copy  and a pair of inverted repeats . there were no obvious sequence inversions or genomic rearrangements . among these cp genomes, genome size ranged from  <dig>  bp  to  <dig>  bp . the length varied from  <dig>  bp  to  <dig>  bp  in the lsc region, from  <dig>  bp  to  <dig>  bp  in the ssc region, and from  <dig>  bp  to  <dig>  bp  in ir region. each cp genome was found to harbor a total of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> transfer rna  genes, and eight ribosomal rna  genes . of them, we identified  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trna coding genes and eight rrna coding genes that are located within irs. the lsc region contained  <dig> protein-coding and  <dig> trna genes, while the ssc region had  <dig> protein-coding and one trna gene. the rps <dig> gene is an uniquely divided gene with the 5′ end exon located in the lsc region while two copies of 3′ end exon and intron are located in the irs. the ycf <dig> is located in the boundary regions between ira/ssc, leading to incomplete duplication of the gene within irs. there were  <dig> intron-containing genes, including six trna genes and  <dig> protein-coding genes, almost all of which are single-intron genes except for ycf <dig> and clpp, each having two introns . matk was located within the intron of trnk-uuu with the largest intron . it was found that ycf <dig>  accd, rpl <dig> and ycf <dig> are often absent in plants
 <cit> , but they were detected in the reported camellia cp genomes in this study. similar to other higher plants, one pair of genes, atpb-atpe, was observed to overlap each other with 3-bp. however, psbc-psbd had a 52-bp overlapping region in the camellia cp genomes, which was observed an overlapping 53-bp in gossypium <cit> . note that coding and non-coding regions account for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the whole cp genome, respectively. the overall gc content was approximately  <dig> %, which is almost identical with each other among the eight complete camellia cp genomes.

although genome size and overall genomic structure including gene number and gene order are well conserved, ir expansion/contraction is common in plant cp genomes. in grasses, for example, the termini of two genes, ndhh and ndhf, were reported to have repeatedly migrated into and out of the adjacent irs
 <cit> . whole rps <dig> was located within the lsc region in the most gossypium cp genomes but failed to find in cp genome of g. raimondii d5
 <cit> . kim et al.
 <cit>  considered that the length of angiosperm cp genomes is variable primarily due to the expansion and contraction of the inverted repeat ir region and the single-copy boundary regions. the ir/sc boundary regions of the  <dig> complete camellia cp genomes were compared, showing slight differences in junction positions . the junction positions were conserved across  <dig> camellia cp genomes and were variable in cp genomes of c. taliensis  <dig>  c. reticulata, c. sinensis var. pubilimba, c. danzaiensis, c. pitardii and c. impressinervis. for example, the distances from ndhf and ycf <dig> 5′ end to the junction of irb/ssc were  <dig> and 4 bp, respectively in c. reticulata, and  <dig> and 9 bp, respectively, in c. sinensis var. pubilimba due to the deletion. the distances were  <dig> and 64 bp, respectively, in c. danzaiensis, c. pitardii and c. impressinervis, which is different from the distances of  <dig> and 13 bp, respectively, in other  <dig> camellia cp genomes. the gene ycf <dig> extended into the ira region with  <dig>  bp in the  <dig> cp genomes, with  <dig>  bp in c. reticulata, with  <dig>  bp in c. taliensis  <dig>  with  <dig>  bp in c. sinensis var. pubilimba, and with  <dig>  bp in c. danzaiensis, c. pitardii and c. impressinervis cp genomes.

to investigate levels of genome divergence, multiple alignments of  <dig> camellia cp genome sequences and nine representative plants with fully sequenced cp genomes were performed . with c. sinensis var. assamica as a reference, we plotted sequence identity using vista
 <cit> . the results revealed high sequence similarity across the  <dig> camellia cp genomes, suggesting that camellia cp genomes are rather conserved. however, the marked differences were observed between camellia cp genomes and other plants, including coffea arabica. as expected, the irs are more conserved than single-copy regions, and coding regions are more conserved than noncoding regions. the most divergent coding regions were matk, rpoc <dig>  accd, rps <dig>  ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> . considering high conservation of camellia cp genomes, as above described, we only included c. sinensis var. assamica , c. oleifera , c. reticulata , c. petelotii  and c. pubicosta  that represent a wide phylogenetic diversity to compare and characterize their cp genomic structural variations .

repetitive sequences
repeated sequences are generally considered to be uncommon in cp genomes with the notable exception of a large ir present in most land plants
 <cit> . in order to avoid redundancy, repeat sequences analysis in the five camellia cp genomes mentioned above was carried out with a single ir region. a total of  <dig> repeats were detected in these cp genomes using reputer
 <cit> , including direct, reverse and palindromic repeats . number and distribution of repeats are rather conserved between cp genomes of assa, pubi and reti, excluding reverse repeats. nevertheless, olei and pete cp genomes included three repeat types, that is, direct, reverse and palindromic repeats . among them, direct repeats are the most common, accounting for 62% of the total repeats, followed with palindromic repeat  and reverse repeat  . the lengths of repeats in these five camellia cp genomes were much shorter, ranging from  <dig> to 82 bp , whereas much longer repeats, such as 132-bp and 287-bp repeats were found in the poaceae and fabaceae
 <cit> . palindromic and reverse repeats occurred in a narrower size, ranging from 30–50 bp and 30–35 bp, respectively. in this study, although a minority of repeats was found in intron , the majority were located in igs  and coding sequence  regions  . then, we investigated the repeats shared among the five camellia cp genomes. here, we defined repeats that had identical lengths and located in homologous regions as shared repeats. under such criteria there were  <dig> repeats shared by the five camellia cp genomes and three repeats were presented jointly in four cp genomes. pete had the most unique repeats , while assa, olei and reti showed no unique repeats . previous work suggested that repeat sequences have played an important role in genomic rearrangement and sequence variation in cp genomes through illegitimate recombination and slipped-strand mispairing
 <cit> . the existence of these repeats implies that the region is a potential hotspot for genomic reconfiguration
 <cit> . our results also showed that divergent regions of cp genomes were associated with various repeat sequences such as intergenic atpf/atph. these repeats may further serve as genetic markers for phylogenetic and population genetic studies.

ssr polymorphisms
ssrs usually have a higher mutation rate compared to other neutral dna regions due to slipped dna strands. they thus are often used as genetic markers, providing useful information concerning plant population genetics and ecological and evolutionary studies due to their non-recombinant, haploid and uniparentally inherited nature
 <cit> . in total,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ssrs were found in the cp genomes of assa, olei, pubi, pete and reti, respectively . mononucleotide  and hexanucleotide  repeats were detected in the five camellia cp genomes. one tetranucleotide  repeat was only found in reti cp genome, and no dinucleotide and trinculeotide repeats were observed. the repeat unit a/t was found to be the most abundant with particular repeat numbers of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the finding is consistent with a previous observation that cp ssrs were dominated by a or t mononucleotide repeats
 <cit> . mononucleotide and hexanucleotide repeats were composed of a or t at a higher level, which reflects a biased base composition with an overall a-t richness in the cp genomes
 <cit> . within the five camellia cp genomes, ssr loci mainly located in igs, following by cds and introns. there were a/t  ssrs located in cds-igs  expect for pete. no ssrs were found in the trnas and rrnas. we observed that  <dig> ssrs located in seven protein-coding genes  of the five camellia cp genomes. jakobsson et al.
 <cit>  indicated that cp ssrs located in the non-coding regions of the cp genome commonly show intraspecific variation in repeat number. most of those ssrs loci were located in lsc region, followed by ir and ssc regions. we found that  <dig> ssr loci were located in irs of the five camellia cp genomes. this observation is surprising because concerted evolution, as suggested earlier, should lead to exact sequence duplication in ira compared with irb, and therefore both irs should contain the same number of nucleotide repeats. this may be explained by the incomplete repeat of ycf <dig> in irb that led to the five ssrs located in irb and inexactly identical ssrs between ira and irb. length variations in ssrs have served as useful markers for identifying crop varieties and performing population genetic studies
 <cit> . cp ssrs characterized in this study could undoubtedly provide an assay for detecting polymorphisms at the population-level and comparing more distantly phylogenetic relationships at the genus level or above.

substitution and indel variation
global alignment of the five camellia cp genomes revealed that total substitutions varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the base substitution types between c and g were fewer than other types, in agreement with a previous study
 <cit> . a comparison of indels among these cp genomes  showed that the number of indels ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these indel events were mainly attributed to the repetition of an adjacent sequence, probably caused by slipped-strand mis-pairing in dna replication
 <cit> . indels are thought to be a major driving force in sequence evolution
 <cit> . we observed that there were the fewest substitutions and indels between assa and pubi. the ratios of nucleotide substitution events to indel events  for different pairwise comparisons showed that, among the five camellia cp genomes, the s/i ratio varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . given the s/i ratio increased with divergence times between genomes
 <cit> , assa was inferred to be close to pubi , suggesting that pubi may be classified into sect. thea. the likely explanation is that the s/i ratio increased with the increase of divergence times that may arise from systematic underestimation of indels in more distantly related species
 <cit> .

the upper triangle shows the number of indels, while the lower triangle indicates the total nucleotide substitutions. the ratios of nucleotide substitutions to indels  are given in brackets.

the number of short indels  accounted for >90% of total indels . as expected, single-nucleotide  indels were the most common, accounting for approximately 38%  to 54%  of all indels. xu et al.
 <cit>  concluded that 1–3 bp indels were mainly attributed to the ssr polymorphisms. yamane et al.
 <cit>  and mccluskey et al.
 <cit>  observed that the number of indels decreased rapidly with the increase of indel lengths. however, we observed that the 5-6-bp indels were the almost second most abundant of all characterized indels, except for olei, rather than 2-bp indels, and the number of 5-6-bp indels was apparently more than that of 3-4-bp indels. it is likely that such 5-6-bp indels were caused by adjacent 5-6-bp motif duplications or losses, making it the second most common type
 <cit> .

molecular marker identification
molecular evolutionary rates are often associated with life history in flowering plants
 <cit> . the camellia species with rather long-generation times may have evolved slowly. considering that a low rate of molecular evolution could complicate the phylogenetic analysis of camellia, the identification of rapidly evolving cp genomic regions is critical through comparative genomic analysis. for purposes of the subsequent evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses, whole cp genome annotation and sequence comparisons showed that the number and distribution patterns of variable characters in coding and non-coding regions were fairly different among the five camellia cp genomes . among them, the proportions of variability in non-coding regions ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> % with a mean value of  <dig> %, which were twice as much as in the coding regions . fewer mutations were observed within ir regions, including coding and non-coding regions, than lsc and ssc regions. for coding regions, the remarkably high proportions of variability of rps <dig> were observed in all five camellia cp genomes. the high variability of gene rps <dig> might result from their extension into ir region where intrachromosomal recombinations frequently occurred to ensure the stability and consistency of irs
 <cit> . the proportion of variability in camellia was lower than that in grasses
 <cit> . we thus chose the  <dig> most variable non-coding regions that may serve as candidate markers for phylogenetic reconstruction , which were identified with variations that exceed  <dig> % in the five camellia cp genomes. they were trnh-gug/psba, psbk/psbi, trns-gcu/trng-gcc, trng-gcc intron, atpf/atph, trne-uuc/trnt-ggu, trns-uga/psbz, psaa/ycf <dig>  trnp-ugg/psaj, trnt-ugu/trnl-uaa, rps18/rpl <dig>  petd/rpoa, ycf15/trnl-caa, ndhf/rpl <dig> and ccsa/ndhd. two of them were located in ssc region  and the ycf15/trnl-caa was located in ir regions. however, the determination whether these  <dig> regions could be applied to phylogenetic analyses in camellia requires further studies.

structural constraints on evolutionary divergence
previous studies suggested that evolutionary differences in the cp genomes are dependent on the sequence and gene functions
 <cit>  and related to the structural constraints
 <cit> . an alignment was performed among the cds, introns, and igs regions, along with positional information of the five camellia cp genomes. the sequence divergence ratios among the three regions  were 1: <dig> : <dig>  , 1: <dig> : <dig>  , 1:1: <dig>   , 1: <dig> : <dig>   and 1: <dig> : <dig>  , respectively . the result clearly suggests that the intron sequences have evolved faster than the cds but slower than the igs sequences. the rapid evolution of intron sequence was attributed to sequence divergence ratios in lsc and ssc . this finding is also supported by a previous statement that the nucleotide substitution rates in the igs sequences and introns are higher than the cds
 <cit> . the sequence alignment data sets were further partitioned into ir, lsc and ssc regions, and the sequence divergence ratios among the three regions  were found to be 1: <dig> : <dig>  , 1: <dig> : <dig>  , 1: <dig> : <dig>   , 1: <dig> : <dig>   and 1: <dig> : <dig>  , respectively . such comparisons apparently indicate that the ir regions may have evolved much more slowly than the lsc and ssc regions, and levels of evolutionary divergence of introns in irs were much lower than those of introns in lscs and sscs . the frequent intrachromosomal recombination events between these two identical ir regions of the cp genome provide selective constraints on both sequence homogeneity and structural stability
 <cit> . this could be used to explain why the ir regions exhibit slow nucleotide substitution rates in comparison with the ssc and lsc regions in this study. our results thus confirm that positional effects are stronger constraints for sequence evolution than the functional groups of chloroplast genes, in good agreement with the previous observation
 <cit> .

phylogenomic analyses
the phylogenetic studies based on the cp genome sequences are addressed successfully for the phylogenetic issues of angiosperm
 <cit> . the species in the sect. thea have long been considered to be a complex and taxonomically difficult group because of their alike morphological characteristics. chang et al.
 <cit>  classified the sect. thea into a total of  <dig> series, which comprised  <dig> species and four varieties. however, min et al.
 <cit>  proposed to taxonomically classify this section into  <dig> species and  <dig> varieties. in particular, there is a controversy on the taxonomy of c. pubicosta native to laos. this species was classified into sect. thea by chang et al.
 <cit> , while min et al.
 <cit>  insisted to classify into sect. corallina considering that some characters of c. pubicosta are different with that of other members in sect. thea. using c. reticulata that belongs to sect. camellia as outgroup, our phylogenetic analysis of orthologous sequences from the sampled species in this study and recently sequenced species  of sect. thea showed that the ml tree was mostly consistent with mp tree with high bootstrap supports, except for the position of c. taliensis . it is notable that c. pubicosta was sister to c. sinensis var. assamica and c. grandibracteata with bs = 100% , supporting chang’s taxonomical treatment that c. pubicosta was classified into sect. thea. previous phylogenetic analysis using rapds reported that the species of sect. thea could be divided into two groups, consistent with the number of locule ovary, that is, 5-locule ovary group and 3-locule ovary group
 <cit> . as the first well-supported phylogenomic analyses of sect. thea, however, our results evidently demonstrated that phylogenetic relationships and molecular evolution of the species in sect. thea did not well follow the number of locule ovary. for example, c. fangchengensis, c. ptilophylla, c. tachangensis, c. kwangsiensis and c. crassicolumna var. crassicolumna were well supported as monophyletic. however, c. fangchengensis and c. ptilophylla belonged to ser. sinenses with  <dig> ovaries, while c. tachangensis, c. kwangsiensis and c. crassicolumna var. crassicolumna were members of ser. quinquelocularis and ser. pentastylae with  <dig> ovaries. our results thus indicated that taxonomical value of the number of ovary may be reconsidered to classify the camellia species.

the phylogenetic analyses were performed based on the entire cp genome sequences from  <dig> camellia cp genomes , showing that the species of sect.thea formed a monophyletic clade, except for the three individuals of c. taliensis, which is close to c. yunnanensis. this result indicated that c. taliensis may not be the ancestors of c. sinensis var. assamica <cit>  and there might be hybridization between c. taliensis and c. yunnanensis due to chimeric habitats. we observed that c.danzaiensis, c.pitardii and c.reticulata formed a monophyletic clade with strong bootstrap support, which might suggest that c. danzaiensis belongs to subgen. camellia, rather than subgen. thea. the different positions of c. impressinervis and c. cuspidate in ml and mp tree made more samples to resolve their phylogenetic relationship is essential. further genomic and taxon sampling and more complete cp genomes of camellia are deserved in further studies as phylogenomic analysis tends to suffer from the poor sampling
 <cit> .

indels not only play an important role in elucidating genome evolution
 <cit> , but also have potential value in constructing phylogenies
 <cit> . a total of  <dig> putative informative indels were identified by pairwise comparisons, and then mapped to the cp genome-based phylogenetic tree using c. arabic as outgroup . of these,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> indels were located in introns, cds and cds-igs, respectively. among these five branches, the branch resulting in reti contained the most number of indels . we observed the most number of indels that were shared between assa  and pubi , suggesting their short divergence times and close relationships. of all indels,  <dig> were able to be mapped to phylogenetic tree with high bootstrap supports and thus are indicative of synapomorphies. the remaining  <dig> indels may be homoplasies possibly associated with parallel mutations or back mutations during evolutionary history, which somehow had negative effects on the reconstruction of phylogenetic tree. such indels should be carefully used especially when a few number of dna fragments were applied for phylogenetic studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we reported eight complete and five draft cp genomes in the genus camellia using illumina sequencing technology via a combination of de novo and reference-guided assembly. these cp genomes were found highly conserved each other. we investigated the variation of repeat sequences, ssrs, indels and substitutions among the five complete camellia cp genomes, representing a wide phylogenetic diversity in the genus camellia. the fifteen rapidly evolving regions were identified across these cp genomes that could serve as potential molecular markers for further phylogenetic studies. this study is undoubtedly the first successful attempt to provide well-supported evolutionary relationships of sect. thea based on phylogenomic analyses. the obtained cp genomes may facilitate the development of biotechnological applications for these economically important woody plants, and offer useful genetic information for purposes of phylogenetics, taxonomy and species identification in the genus camellia.
