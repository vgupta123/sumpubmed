BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small regulatory molecules  that are important in many biological processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism  <cit> . the role of mirnas in lipid metabolism was first reported in drosophila, where the deletion of mir- <dig> increased the levels of triacylglycerol and diacylglycerol  <cit> . thereafter, several mirnas were shown to promote preadipocyte differentiation in the human and mouse  <cit> . analysis of the 3' utr from  <dig> ests expressed in 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes during conversion into lipid-assimilating adipocytes showed that >70% of the differentially expressed genes may be potentially regulated by mirnas  <cit> . a recent study on the expression of  <dig> mirnas in human omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues found that the expression of mirnas was adipose depot specific and that some mirnas were correlated with the morphology of adipose tissue and adipocyte size  <cit> . although the roles of some mirnas in lipid metabolism  <cit>  and adipocyte formation  <cit>  have been demonstrated, no mirna has been reported to regulate lipid metabolism in beef cattle. lipid deposition, especially in subcutaneous adipose tissues, is directly associated with the yield and the quality of meat  <cit> . we hypothesized that micrornas play a role in the regulation of adipogenesis in bovine adipose tissue and the variation of expression of mirnas is associated with differences in backfat thickness. to gain insight into the association between subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness and mirna expression, the expression profiles of  <dig> mirnas were determined in beef cattle subcutaneous adipose tissues of crossbred steers with different backfat thickness.

RESULTS
the aim of this study was to identify mirnas which may play regulatory roles in adipose tissue development in beef cattle.

the expression of mirnas differed significantly in response to host genetic components
analysis of the expression of  <dig> mirnas including four bovine specific mirnas  in beef cattle back subcutaneous adipose tissues confirmed the expression of  <dig> mirnas. the animals were divided into  <dig> groups, according to breed and level of backfat thickness. hierarchical clustering of the detectable mirnas showed the expression of mirnas was more similar in animals of the same breed composition than animals with the same level of backfat thickness . we also compared mirna expression among three crossbred groups and found the expression of  <dig> mirnas to be significantly different among these groups. these results suggest that the expression of mirnas may differ with regard to host genetic components. char animals have mirna expression patterns more similar with those of hean animals , with  <dig> significantly different mirnas. twenty-nine and  <dig> mirnas were found to be significantly different between cham and char crossbreds, and between cham and hean crossbreds, respectively. however, the backfat thickness of char animals was significantly different than that of hean animals and was similar with that of cham animals .

differentially expressed mirnas in adipose tissues from animals with different backfat thickness
fifteen differentially expressed  mirnas were identified between tissues from high and low backfat thickness . of these  <dig> de mirnas, seven  were identified as highly expressed in the tissue  from high backfat thickness animals, whereas the remaining eight  were expressed at a higher level in tissue from the low backfat thickness animals . the most differentially expressed mirna was mir- <dig> with a  <dig> -fold increase in high backfat thickness tissues, suggesting that this mirna may have a role in adipogenesis and/or lipid deposition in bovine backfat tissues.

in mouse the mir-17- <dig> cluster has been reported to promote preadipocyte differentiation  <cit> ; and the mir-17- <dig> cluster with other two cluster paralogs  were found to promote cell proliferation  <cit> . to test whether the mirnas of the mir-17- <dig> family are expressed higher in tissues with high backfat thickness, expression patterns of all members omitting mir-20b  were profiled. unexpectedly, no de mirna from three clusters were identified, with the exception of mir- <dig> which was found  <dig> -fold down-regulated in tissues from high backfat thickness animals compared to those from low backfat thickness animals . our undetected expression difference of the mir-17- <dig> cluster from this study confirmed the previous observation that bovine adipogenesis had different molecular mechanisms than those in mice based on the study of gene expression patterns  <cit> . in addition, the mir-17- <dig> cluster was found to be up-regulated during the early clonal expansion stage of adipogenesis  <cit>  and was not abundantly expressed in differentiated adipocytes  <cit> . since backfat tissues are mixture of preadipocytes, adipocytes and other cells, the stage of adipogenesis could be very different from the pure adipocyte cultures. further study to verify the expression of mir-17- <dig> using a bovine adipocyte cell line will provide a better understanding of this mirna cluster in bovine adipogenesis. in addition, mir- <dig> was  <dig> -fold up-regulated in the tissues from high backfat animals, it has been reported that mir- <dig> was up-regulated during preadipocyte differentiation in human and mouse  <cit> , suggesting that this mirna may promote bovine adipogenesis that may accelerate adipose tissue development.

backfat thickness associated mirnas
to confirm the above correlation between mirna expression levels and backfat thickness, we further investigated the relationship between the expression of mirnas and backfat thickness using pearson correlation and simple linear regression analysis. eighteen mirnas, representing 20% of all analyzed mirnas , were identified as being significantly associated with backfat thickness in beef animals. among the backfat thicknessassociated mirnas, eight were de mirnas identified above, including two up-regulated mirnas  and six down-regulated mirnas  . the most differentially expressed mirna  was shown to have the strongest correlation with backfat thickness . four bovine specific mirnas which were identified from our previous study  <cit>  were also confirmed to be expressed in all the analyzed samples. among them, one mirna  was significantly correlated to backfat thickness , suggesting that this bovine specific mirna may play a role in the adipogenesis of adipose tissues in cattle. the mechanism of how this mirna influences bovine adipogenesis can be elucidated by studying the expression of this mirna in bovine adipocyte cells and to identify its target genes.

most of backfat thickness associated mirnas in this study were found to be negatively correlated to backfat depth . for example, the mir-106b- <dig> cluster, a mirna cluster paralog of mir-17- <dig>  was moderately negatively correlated with backfat thickness. these data suggest that mirna may regulate white adipose tissue development, and that the difference in thickness of subcutaneous tissues may be one target. more research is needed to verify this and to provide intracellular/gene mechanisms.

potential role of mir- <dig> in bovine adipogenesis
approximately two thirds of the mirnas that were correlated with backfat thickness in this study were identified in introns or exons of genes . intronic mirnas may be coordinately expressed with their targeted gene mrnas  <cit>  and may act synergistically with the targeted genes  <cit> . mir- <dig>  the most de and the strongest associated with backfat thickness, was found to be located in intron  <dig> of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator  <dig> beta  . since pgc-1β has been shown to be induced during brown adipocyte differentiation  <cit>  and to increase lipogenesis and lipoprotein transport in the liver  <cit> , we suggest that pgc-1β may play a role in white adipose tissue development. furthermore, a search of microcosm targets v <dig> http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/microcosm/htdocs/targets/v5/ with mir- <dig> identified  <dig> potential target genes. one interesting target gene is mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> . mapk <dig> can mediate phosphorylation of the dominant adipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ  and reduce its transcriptional activity  <cit> . pparγ is up regulated in bovine preadipocyte adipogenesis,  <cit>  and the knock-down of pparγ markedly inhibited preadipocyte-to adipocyte conversion in 3t3-l <dig> cells  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that mir- <dig> may promote bovine adipogenesis in white adipose tissue through targeting mapk <dig> and pparγ . however, this regulatory mechanism may be one of the many other functions this mirna may have. since mirna- <dig> can also target many other genes, future studies on the relationships of mirna target genes and how the network of these target genes could impact on white adipose tissue development will supply a comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms of fat formation, a very complicated process in beef cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
we assessed the mirna expression patterns in the subcutaneous  adipose depot of crossbred beef cattle and found that the expression patterns of mirna were different depending on host genetic components. in total,  <dig> mirna were detected, and  <dig> mirnas were identified as being associated with backfat thickness, suggesting that mirnas may play an important role in white adipose tissue development in beef cattle. mirna- <dig> was found to be the most de and strongly associated mirna with backfat thickness. this mirna has a potential function of regulating bovine adipogenesis by targeting mapk <dig> and of pparγ. future work to study mirna expression of adipose collected from different growth stage, among different adipose tissue depots, or from key individual cell populations derived from adipose tissue proper, is necessary to elucidate the functions of mirna in bovine lipid metabolism. these will prove useful knowledge to reduce the development of inefficient adipose tissue depots , while enhancing the formation of desired depots  in beef cattle. such knowledge may also apply to humans, especially in terms of regulation of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or obesity.
