BACKGROUND
a large number of cellular processes are mediated through protein-protein interactions. in general, these interactions are non-covalent and are outcome of hydrophobic or ionic or both interactions. in case of thioredoxin , a protein-protein interaction is followed by the exchange of disulfide from thioredoxin to the substrate protein. trx is a major protein disulfide reductase responsible for maintaining the redox state of cytosol. they are involved in large number of cell processes and regulate the activity of many proteins through reversible reduction of their disulfide bonds. the specificity of a trx towards its target is determined by the local environment around its active site  <cit> . thioredoxins  take electrons for their reduction from nadph via thioredoxin reductase and then transfer them to target disulfide  <cit> ; hence, they play a key role in a cell's defense against oxidative stress. trxs have a universal folding pattern known as 'thioredoxin fold' and a conserved but solvent exposed cxxc motif, as an active site  <cit> . in e.coli, trxs are also involved in the reduction of disulfide bonds of oxyr, hsp <dig> etc. and regulate their biochemical function  <cit> . they often regenerate cellular proteins by reducing non-specific disulfides formed during oxidative stress thus also function as an important antioxidant system. in eukaryotes, trxs regulate activity of transcription factors nf-κb and ap- <dig>  <cit> . the activation of peroxiredoxins, which facilitates reduction of reactive oxygen species, is dependent on trxs  <cit> .

alpha -glucan branching enzyme  of mycobacterium tuberculosis  is encoded by rv1326c  <cit> . earlier, we have reported that the recombinant protein produced by rv1326c is functionally active  <cit> . amino acids sequence analysis showed that both mtb and m. bovis glgb has four cysteine residues  but are absent in other mycobacteria. we indicated that cysteine residues of mtb glgb may form intra-molecular disulfide bond and its reduction leads to a conformational change of the protein  <cit> . high density transposon mutagenesis  <cit>  showed that glgb gene is essential for the optimal growth of mtb in vitro, suggesting that it is an important gene. however, its importance in physiology of mtb has not yet been established. mtb has three different pathways for trehalose biosynthesis  <cit>  where glgb is likely to be a part of one of the pathways. glycogen is a mixture of glucose polymers, thus glgb may help in the synthesis of a precursor for trehalose biosynthesis. both in mycobacteria and corynebacteria, trehalose is a basic component of a number of cell wall glycolipids  <cit> , cord factor , sulpholipids  and trehalose containing lipo-oligosaccharides  <cit> . lately, enzymes of trehalose biosynthetic pathways have gained major attention as drug targets especially in mycobacteria, as capsular polysaccharides of mtb have been found to modulate the host immune response  <cit> .

in streptomyces coelicolor a <dig>  whib gene was shown to be associated with sporulation  <cit> . mtb does not sporulate but has seven orfs which are orthologues of whib of s. coelicolor  <cit> . the presence of multiple whib genes in m. leprae  <cit>  and the growing body of evidence that these genes are involved in cell division, oxidative stress, antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis etc.  <cit> , suggests that these genes are likely to have functional significance in mycobacteria. amino acid sequence analysis of whib proteins showed that they all have four conserved cysteines. except in whib5/rv0022c of mtb, which has a cxxxc motif, all other whib proteins have a cxxc motif which is similar to thioredoxins and other oxidoreductases. in mycobacteria, orfs showing sequence similarities to whib are annotated as putative transcription factors  <cit> . however, so far the molecular function of whib proteins as a dna binding proteins has not been established. we have reported that whib proteins, except whib <dig>  have properties similar to thioredoxin  <cit>  suggesting that these proteins would function via protein-protein interaction. interaction of thioredoxins with substrate protein involves exchange of thiol-disulfide. however, occasionally thioredoxins also regulate the activity of the cognate protein independent of disulfide exchange  <cit> .

in the present study, we show that whib <dig> and glgb of mtb exchange their thiol disulfide. initially, glgb was identified as a possible substrate protein of whib <dig> in a yeast two-hybrid screen. physical interaction between the two proteins was confirmed by gst pull-down assay. the data obtained from the mass spectrometry and 4-acetamido-4' maleimidyl-stilbene- <dig>  2'-disulfonic acid  trapping confirmed that an intra-molecular disulfide bond is formed between c <dig> and c <dig> of mtb glgb. using a series of biochemical methods; we suggest that glgb is a substrate of whib <dig> 

RESULTS
whib <dig> interacts with glgb
whib <dig>  a thioredoxin like protein is likely to function via protein-protein interaction therefore, yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify the potential interacting partner/s of whib <dig>  the suitability of yeast two-hybrid system to study mycobacterial protein-protein interaction has been well demonstrated  <cit> .

the expression of whib <dig>  was studied by repression assay where the β-galactosidase  activity of s. cerevisiae cells transformed with vector pjk <dig> and pdbd-b <dig> was measured. in yeast two-hybrid analysis, when bait is expressed and binds to the lexa operator region, the expression of downstream reporter gene  is repressed. the β-gal expression was significantly repressed in the cells transformed with pdbd-b <dig> whereas, the transformants lacking bait showed increased β-gal expression . the data clearly suggested that the whib <dig> expressed in the yeast cell and was able to bind to the operator region. the intrinsic transcription activation of bait was ruled out by testing the expression of β-gal of s. cerevisiae transformed by constructs: psh18- <dig> + pjg4- <dig> + pdbd-b <dig>  transformants containing: psh18- <dig> + pjg4- <dig> + psh17- <dig> and psh18- <dig> + pjg4-5+ prfhm <dig> were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. absence of blue color in the test transformants clones  similar to the negative control clones  confirmed that whib <dig> lack intrinsic transcription activation property and was suitable to be used in yeast two-hybrid analysis.

to search for an interaction partner, s. cerevisiae cells were transformed with pdbd-b <dig>  and the genomic library of mtb h37rv, which was created as a fusion to the activation domain  of gal4p. the system used in this study is based upon the transcription of a reporter gene which occurs when the two separately expressed domains of gal4p physically interact. therefore, when the two proteins are expressed as a fusion to two different domains of gal4p, their physical interaction leads to functional reconstitution of gal4p thereby leading to the activation of expression of reporter genes, leu <dig> or lacz, when grown in a medium containing galactose but not glucose. at the end of the screening process, we obtained sixteen clones exclusively growing on galactose medium in the absence of leucine . among all,  <dig> clones had an in-frame fusion with  <dig> bp 3' end of orf rv1326c/glgb whereas one was false positive .

results obtained by yeast-two hybrid analysis were further confirmed by gst pull-down assay. whib <dig> and whib <dig> proteins were expressed as a fusion to gst . both, pgex-b <dig> and pgex-b <dig>  were co-expressed separately with petgl . the proteins were immobilized on glutathione sepharose resin. the absence of glgb in lanes: gst alone and whib4-gst  suggested that the interaction between whib <dig> and glgb is specific. it is evident from the figure.  <dig> that whib <dig> interacts with glgb but not with whib <dig> or gst alone, suggesting that the interaction of glgb and whib <dig> is specific. in the pull down assay a ~ <dig> kda protein was co-eluted. n-terminal amino acids sequencing of this protein identified it as a cleaved gst.

the interaction data was surprising because to the best of our knowledge, interaction of a trx-like protein with an enzyme of sugar metabolic pathway has not been reported in any microorganism except cyanobacteria. amino acids sequence analysis of glgbs from different organisms showed that except mtb and m. bovis, no other glgb has four cysteine residues. earlier, we have reported that mtb glgb has at least one intra-molecular disulfide bond  <cit> . therefore, we investigated the number and arrangement of intra-molecular disulfide bond in glgb.

c <dig> and c <dig> of glgb form an intra-molecular disulfide bond
the peptide mass finger printing analysis of tryptic digests of cysteine alkylated and non alkylated glgb showed that both c <dig>  and c <dig>  were alkylated under oxidizing conditions suggesting that these two cysteine residues were free and surface exposed , while peptides containing either c <dig> or c <dig> could not be detected. surprisingly, we could not detect the peptide containing c <dig> and c <dig> even under normal reducing conditions. however, incubation of reduced glgb at 45°c followed by alkylation and trypsin digestion resulted in to the detection of peptide  containing c <dig> but not the peptide  containing c <dig>  the result indicated that under normal reducing conditions, the peptide with c <dig> and c <dig> might be buried and was not accessible to trypsin, whereas at 45°c, possibly a change in conformation led to the exposure of an internal trypsin recognition site which released the peptide with c <dig> but not the peptide stretch containing c <dig>  based upon our earlier report  <cit>  and the present mass spectrometry data, we propose that an intra-molecular disulfide bond is formed between c <dig> and c <dig> 

in order to know about the domain organization in mtb glgb, a structure model was generated  using the structure of e. coli glgb as a template . the e. coli glgb structure was determined without one of the n-terminal domains  because of crystallization related problems  <cit> . the e. coli glgb contains three laterally arranged domains i.e. n <dig>  catalytic  and the c-terminal domains. the relative orientation and function of the n <dig> domain is not yet known and it is assumed that it possibly regulates the size of sugar branching during glycogen synthesis  <cit> . the model indicated that mtb glgb is also likely to have four domains. interestingly, each of the domains of mtb glgb has one cysteine residue . it appears that an intra-molecular disulfide bond may link the n <dig> and catalytic domains and after reduction, the two domains would have separated which exposed the c <dig> while the n <dig> domain, especially the region containing c <dig> might have got re-oriented therefore was not accessible for trypsinization. this could be a possible reason why the peptide containing c <dig> was not detected in mass spectrometry. based upon the mass spectrometry data and structural model, a possible scheme of domains organization in oxidized glgb has been depicted in the figure  <dig> 

whib <dig> and glgb interaction involves exchange of thiol-disulfide
to prove the hypothesis that interaction of whib <dig> with glgb may involve exchange of thiol-disulfide, the trx affinity chromatography method, originally developed by motohashi et al.   <cit>  was employed. first of all, a whib1c40s mutant was generated, which rendered c <dig> to remain as a thiolate ion. to demonstrate the formation of hetero-disulfide bond between glgb and whib <dig>  purified whib1c40s or whib1wt  proteins were covalently immobilized on cnbr activated sepharose resin. both c <dig> and c <dig> of glgb were alkylated under oxidizing condition to prevent a non-specific reaction between free thiols of glgb and c <dig> of whib <dig>  interaction was initiated by mixing immobilized whib1c40s and pre-alkylated oxidized glgb. the reaction was terminated at different time points and samples were resolved by non-reducing page. the figure 5a clearly shows that glgb formed a complex with whib1c40s just after  <dig> minutes of interaction unlike whib1wt where glgb was washed out completely in high salt buffer. the result indicated that a binary complex formed between glgb and whib1c40s was stabilized by a hetero-disulfide bond.

in trx affinity chromatography, the binary complex formed between the two proteins is not released because whib1/whib1c40s is covalently bound to the resin. in order to demonstrate that glgb and whib <dig> are indeed linked by a hetero-disulfide bond, purified pre-alkylated oxidized glgb and whib1c40s were incubated together in the interaction buffer. the reaction was terminated at different time points and the samples were resolved by sds-page. a higher molecular weight protein band  along with the two input bands of glgb  and whib1c40s , was clearly visible . the ~ <dig> kda protein band corresponded to the combined sizes of glgb: whib1c40s binary complex which disappeared when 1% β-me was added to the sample , thus confirming the formation of an inter-molecular hetero-disulfide bond between glgb and whib1c40s. as expected, the ~ <dig> kda band was missing in the glgb: whib1wt control sample  because the intact cxxc motif of whib1wt could not form a stable inter-molecular hetero-disulfide bond with glgb.

the direct evidence for the reduction of glgb disulfide by whib <dig> was shown using ams trapping method. the fluorescent dye, ams, absorbs light at  <dig> nm and emits at  <dig> nm. binding of each molecule of ams also increases the mass of a protein by ~ <dig> da. thus, ams labeled proteins fluoresce under uv light and show reduced mobility on sds-page. purified mtb glgb was pre-alkylated under oxidizing condition with iodoacetamide  to block the free cysteines thus ams binding would occur if c <dig> and c <dig> are free either due to the reduction by whib <dig> or dtt or by other trx-like proteins. the ams treatment of oxidized and pre-alkylated glgb did not show any fluorescence or mobility shift , suggesting that the free cysteines were successfully alkylated. pre-alkylated glgb when reduced by dtt and then labeled with ams fluoresced under uv light and also showed mobility shift . similarly, when pre-alkylated glgb was incubated with pre-reduced whib <dig> and labeled with ams, it fluoresced under uv light and showed mobility shift on the gel . however, pre-alkylated glgb incubated with oxidized whib <dig> and then labeled with ams failed to fluoresce and also did not show any mobility shift . together, these data suggested that whib <dig> converted the disulfide of glgb into reduced thiol, to which ams reacted covalently. in order to know whether glgb's disulfide could be reduced by other trxs of mtb; trxb and trxc of mtb were cloned, expressed and proteins were purified . both, trxb and trxc catalyzed the reduction of insulin disulfides by dtt suggesting that the proteins were in native conformation and enzymatically active . however, incubation of glgb with either reduced whib <dig> or trxb or trxc did not show ams labeling of glgb . the data clearly suggested that the transfer of reducing equivalents from whib <dig> to glgb is a highly specific reaction, as its absence could not be compensated either by known trxs or whib <dig> of mtb. the result also confirmed that c <dig> and c <dig> of glgb form an intra-molecular disulfide bond.

whib <dig> promoter activates at late stationary phase
for a successful interaction between two proteins, it is essential that both are present in the cytosol at the same time. the glycogen synthesis in s. coelicolor a <dig> has been shown to be associated with sporulation which represent stationary phase of the growth  <cit> . in order to determine the stage when whib <dig> is expressed, the upstream regulatory sequence of whib <dig> was cloned upstream to the lacz of a promoter less vector pjem <dig>  <cit> . the expression of β-gal was monitored at different stages of growth. for the first  <dig> h, the expression was at the basal level. however, it induced after  <dig> h of growth and increased suddenly by  <dig> h . the increase in β-gal activity continued up to  <dig> h and saturated afterwards, suggesting that the whib <dig> expression is likely to be at the late stationary phase of the growth. increased level of whib <dig> transcripts in stationary phase has also been demonstrated by rt-pcr  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that interaction between glgb and whib <dig> is a stationary phase phenomenon.

interaction of glgb with trxs has been reported in chloroplast and synechocystis sps.  <cit> . although, a trx-mediated post-translational regulation of glgb in the photosynthetic organisms has been indicated but the biochemical evidence to this has not been demonstrated yet. earlier, we have shown a redox mediated conformational change in mtb glgb  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that under oxidizing conditions ; an intra-molecular disulfide bond formed between c <dig> and c <dig>  this would possibly bring a conformational change in glgb which may introduce steric constrain thereby can affect the stability of the protein. recently, whib <dig> has been demonstrated to co-ordinate an oxidation labile iron-sulfur cluster  <cit> . it appears that under oxidative stress and/or stationary phase , whib <dig> transforms from inactive holo-form to active apo-form, interacts with glgb and reduces its oxidized disulfide. whib1-mediated reduction of oxidized disulfide would possibly regenerate the glgb by bringing back to sterically stable state. therefore, the presence of sterically stable glgb in stationary phase of the growth will be beneficial to cell where metabolism is usually very low thus, bacteria would avoid any excess consumption of atp. however, at this juncture due to the lack of experimental evidence, it will be pre-mature to pinpoint the importance of glgb: whib <dig> interaction and exchange of thiol-disulfide under in vivo conditions. nevertheless, the results described in this study as well as the methods used, would certainly help in deducing many thiol mediated regulatory processes in mtb.

CONCLUSIONS
the data described here show for the first time that glgb, an enzyme of carbohydrate metabolism is a substrate of whib <dig>  a trx-like protein of mtb. since, the disulfide bond formation so far, appears to be unique to mtb and may be to m. bovis also; both glgb and whib <dig> are likely to have much more important role in these two species of mycobacteria than others. although, in yeast-two hybrid analysis we found only glgb as an interacting protein of whib <dig> however, it does not mean that whib <dig> will not interact with any other protein. therefore, a detail analysis of protein-protein interaction between whib <dig> with other proteins of mtb is required to understand entire network, which may exist during stationary phase. further, it is also possible that interaction between whib <dig> and some other protein does not involve thiol-disulfide exchange because trxs from other systems have been shown to act as structural components of other protein  <cit> .
