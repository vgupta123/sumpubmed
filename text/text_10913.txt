BACKGROUND
the ability to penetrate the formidable physical barrier of the plant cell wall is fundamental to successful pathogen invasion of plants and is facilitated by the secretion of cell wall degrading enzymes  by the pathogen. these extracellular effectors degrade a wide range of complex and cross-linked polysaccharides and glycoproteins. pathogen cwdes function not only in plant penetration but also in the release of nutrients for pathogen use. they are important determinants of pathogenicity .

the intricate, interconnected molecular network that constitutes the plant cell wall is centred around three types of polysaccharides: cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin  <cit> . cellulose microfibrils consist of  <dig> to  <dig> β- <dig> -linked glucan chains held together by intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds to form an insoluble scaffold  <cit> . cellulose microfibrils are further cross-linked by hydrogen bonds to hemicellulose molecules and both are embedded in a pectin matrix. hemicelluloses have a backbone of β- <dig> -linked glucose, xylose, mannose and, sometimes, galactose units that are substituted with different side chains whose residues may be modified by the addition of acetyl or methyl groups . xyloglucans are the most abundant hemicellulose and consist of four subunits containing β- <dig> -linked glucan backbones substituted with α- <dig> -xylosyl, β- <dig> -galactosyl and α- <dig> -fucosyl residues in a variety of combinations  <cit> .

the most structurally diverse group of wall polysaccharides is the pectins  <cit> . the three main forms of pectin are homogalacturonan , rhamnogalacturonan i  and rhamnogalacturonan ii . hg is the simplest and most common form of pectin in plant cell walls. it consists of chains of α- <dig> -linked-d-galacturonic acid residues which are secreted in a methyl esterified form and which may also be acetylated at the o- <dig> and o- <dig> positions  <cit> . cross-linking of unmethylesterified hg by calcium allows close packing of the hg chains and gives pectin its gel-like properties  <cit> . rgi polysaccharides consist of a backbone of α- <dig> -rhamnosyl and α- <dig> -galacturonic acid residues  <cit> . the rhamnosyl residues may be substituted with side chains having a diversity of lengths and compositions, including α-linked arabinose residues  and β- <dig> -galactose linked α- <dig> -l-arabinose residues , with some side chains also containing l-fucose and d-glucuronic acid residues  <cit> . α- <dig> -galacturonic acid residues in the backbone may be acetylated. rgii is a highly complex polysaccharide present as dimers linked by a borate ester with backbones of at least seven α- <dig> -linked galacturonic acid residues with a diversity of substitutions that are yet to be characterized  <cit> .

structural and biochemical properties of plant cell walls vary between dicotyledons and monocotyledons. for example, β- <dig> : <dig> -linked glucans are found only in grasses  <cit> . plant cell walls also contain proteins and glycoproteins that may cross-link wall polysaccharides, thus strengthening the wall. they often contain glycosylphosphatidyl inositol  anchors and may function in connection of the wall with the plasma membrane. in glycoproteins, diverse carbohydrate chains are attached via the n in asparagine , by the o in serine/threonine  or by hydroxyproline residues   <cit> . in n-linked oligosaccharides, mannose and n-acetylglucosamine residues form the backbone of the linked carbohydrate moiety  <cit> . in o-linked oligosaccharides, n-acetylgalactosamine residues form the carbohydrate backbone  <cit> . in agps, β- <dig> - and β- <dig> -galactose residues are joined to hydroxyproline and are substituted with many different saccharides including l-fucose, l-rhamnose and d-xylose  <cit> .

the complex nature of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and glycoproteins and their interactions within the cell wall mean that the plant cell wall is a structurally diverse and effective barrier to plant pathogens  <cit> . typically, plant cell wall structure and composition differs in different plant tissues and cell types  <cit>  and changes during growth and development and in response to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . for example, β- <dig> -glucans  are often deposited at the site of pathogen invasion, creating, it is believed in at least some plant-pathogen interactions, a wall that is more resistant to pathogen penetration  <cit> .

synthesis, modification and degradation of the complex carbohydrates that form plant cell walls require large numbers of highly specific enzymes  <cit> . the arabidopsis thaliana genome, for example, contains  <dig> genes encoding proteins involved in these processes and the aspergillus nidulans genome contains  <dig> genes for proteins specifically involved in wall degradation  <cit> . to aid research in this field, protein motifs that confer carbohydrate catalytic activity have been classified into sequence-related families of carbohydrate-active enzyme  modules  <cit> . these modules are divided into six classes – glycoside hydrolases , polysaccharide lyases , carbohydrate esterases , glycosyltransferases , auxiliary activities  and non-catalytic, carbohydrate-binding modules  . the activity of proteins within these classes has been annotated according to sequence homologies, protein folding and known enzyme activities  <cit> . many cazyme proteins contain a number of different modules, allowing them to target specific or divergent substrates .

oomycetes, including phytophthora species, are major plant pathogens worldwide. like fungal phytopathogens, oomycete species produce a wide range of cytoplasmic and extracellular effector proteins that facilitate their successful infection of host plants  <cit> . over recent years, a number of oomycete genomes have been sequenced, providing a wealth of information for studies of oomycete effectors and pathogenicity mechanisms. analyses of genomes from p. sojae, p. infestans, p. ramorum, pseudoperonospora cubensis and pythium species have catalogued cwdes that contain cazyme modules in these organisms , however, the regulation of cazyme production and the role of individual cwdes during plant infection remains largely unknown. the bioinformatic study reported in the present paper builds on the identification of cazymes in these other oomycetes to generate a comprehensive analysis of the complement of cwdes in the broad host range pathogen, p. parasitica. sequence and motif characterizations have been used to explore likely functions of individual p. parasitica cazyme proteins. the study provides the framework for future studies of the expression of p. parasitica cwdes during plant infection.

methods
identification of p. parasiticacwdes
predicted proteins were downloaded from the p. parasitica inra- <dig> sequencing project  <cit>  and screened for carbohydrate-active modules using carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation [dbcan,  <cit> . cazyme module annotation by this program uses e-value, alignment length and coverage, with an e-value of <1e- <dig> for alignments of > <dig> amino acids and an e-value of <1e- <dig> for alignments of < <dig> amino acids. proteins containing gt modules were identified but not included in further analysis. to eliminate proteins identified by dbcan but that were not really cazymes, proteins with cazyme motifs with a dbcan e-value > e- <dig> were individually examined using myhits  <cit> , prosite  <cit>  and blastp of non-redundant protein sequences in national center for biotechnology information   <cit> . proteins for which the alignment coverage was less than  <dig> , were also individually examined. putative cwdes were those identified as containing gh, pl, ce, cbm and aa modules that are known to be associated with the degradation of carbohydrates associated with the cell wall. to identify cwdes that might have been missed by dbcan, additional searches including keyword and pfam  <cit>  domain searches and tblastn analysis  <cit>  with characterised proteins listed on the cazy site  <cit>  were conducted. when there was ambiguity in the identification of a cwde, cazymes analysis toolkit   <cit>  was employed. some proteins were also checked against data in the partially-completed version  <dig> of the p. parasitica genome  <cit> . transcripts identified by dbcan that were predicted to have two unrelated functions were considered to be genome assembly errors and were not included in subsequent analysis. when a protein contained a cbm as well as a gh motif, the protein was classified according to the gh catalytic activity.

because cazyme annotation is based on sequence similarity rather than substrate specificity, enzymes that act on different substrates are placed within the same family and, conversely, enzymes acting on the same substrate are found in different families  <cit> . where possible, the putative function of p. parasitica cazymes has been deduced by comparisons with characterised proteins using blast analysis and identification of key catalytic residues. classical signal peptides for secretion  were identified using signalp  <dig>   <cit>  and proteins targeted to the non-classical secretion pathway identified using secretomep  <dig> f  <cit> . pathogen cwdes need to be secreted in order to function in wall degradation, however, putative cwdes lacking an in silico-recognised sp were retained in the analysis because this in silico analysis is not 100% reliable  <cit> . for proteins where an sp was not detected, the 5' end of the p. parasitica inra- <dig> genomic sequence was manually examined for nearby alternative start codons. transmembrane domains  were identified using phobius  <cit>  and tmhmm  <cit> . potential gpi anchors were identified with predgpi  <cit> .

when a gene appeared to be truncated, the missing sequence data were sought in the immediate upstream or downstream region within the supercontig. phytophthora est data in ncbi and, in some cases, the orthologous coding region in other p. parasitica isolates   <cit>  were used to correct the inra- <dig> isolate gene models. where data from one of these other p. parasitica isolates has been used to modify an inra- <dig> isolate gene sequence, the name of the source isolate is shown as a superscript above the inra- <dig> protein id number from the broad institute sequencing project  <cit> . protein similarities and identities were determined by multiple sequence and pairwise alignments of full-length proteins, omitting the sp if present  <cit> . proteins were considered to be homologs if they shared 25% or more identity with an alignment length greater > <dig> amino acids  <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of cazyme modules in p. parasiticapredicted proteins
a total of  <dig> cazyme modules were identified in  <dig> of the  <dig>  predicted proteins of p. parasitica using dbcan . of these,  <dig> proteins were eliminated from further analysis because they either contained a gt module  or were cazymes that would function intracellularly. blast searches identified  <dig> additional putative cwdes that had carbohydrate-active domains recognised by pfam <dig>  and other protein motif analysis programmes but not by dbcan. the total of  <dig> putative cwde proteins were classified into  <dig> cbm,  <dig> gh, eight ce, three pl and four aa families . two cbm modules  occurred only in conjunction with a gh module and were included in the gh family. analysis of these  <dig> p. parasitica proteins showed that  <dig> contained a classical n-terminal sp,  <dig> contained non-classical secretion sequences,  <dig> contained a tmd and  <dig> contained a gpi anchor sequence.table  <dig>

p. parasitica proteins with multiple cazyme modules were relatively rare, with only  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins  having more than one module. in  <dig> cases, the protein contained two or more copies of the same cazyme module. these included  <dig> proteins with two gh <dig>  cbm <dig> or pl <dig> modules and three proteins with either three or six cbm <dig> modules. in the other  <dig> cases, the protein contained two cazyme modules of different types. in plants and fungi, ce and gh modules are often accompanied by cbm modules  <cit> . as an example, only  <dig> % of p. parasitica gh proteins also contained a cbm module whereas  <dig> % of gh proteins from a. thaliana also have a cbm module  <cit> .

cazyme classification relies upon amino acid sequence but since tertiary structure and substrate binding is dependent upon primary structure, the substrate of many cwdes can be inferred from the primary sequence data. however, it is possible for slight differences in protein folding arising from small variations in amino acid sequence to change the targetted substrate  <cit> . where possible, sequence homology with characterized cazymes has been used to group predicted cwdes according to the substrate they degrade.

cazymes involved in cellulose degradation
the β- <dig> -linked glucose residues that form cellulose can be degraded by enzymes that fall into four broad categories: endo- and exo-β- <dig> -glucanases  <cit> , cellobiohydrolases  <cit>  and β-glucosidases  <cit> . there are also aa proteins that assist in cellulose breakdown through direct or indirect enzyme activity  <cit> , and cbms that bind to cellulose and act to concentrate enzyme activities. in some cases, cbms may mediate non-catalytic disruption of the crystalline structure of cellulose, thereby facilitating degradation via catalytic modules  <cit> . in p. parasitica, cazyme families containing exo-β- <dig> -glucanases include gh <dig> and gh <dig> while families containing endo-β- <dig> -glucanases include gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig>  cellobiohydrolases are found in gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> and β-glucosidases occur in gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families. cellulose is not the sole substrate for many of the cazymes in these families and hemicelluloses and pectins are often also targetted. p. parasitica aa proteins consist of two types of monooxygenases that cause direct oxidative cleavage , and one family of reductases  that produce hydroxyl radicals resulting in the non-enzymatic breakdown of cellulose chains  <cit> . the genome also contains two cbm families that are specific for cellulose  <cit> .

glycosyl hydrolases
gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families include enzymes that target disaccharides and the terminal non-reducing end of a range of polysaccharides  . fungal phytopathogens typically have small gh <dig> families  but in p. parasitica there are  <dig> gh <dig> proteins, many of which contain conserved residues important for β-glucosidase activity  <cit> . it was not possible to determine specific enzyme activities of the p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins based on sequence homologies with characterized enzymes but  <dig>  contained a tmd in the c-terminal region and overall share 29% amino acid identity . the implied membrane-anchorage may be indicative of a role of these enzymes in the modification of phytophthora rather than of host cell walls. for example, a. thaliana contains plasma membrane located β-glucosidases from both gh <dig> and gh <dig> families and they are thought to act in the production and modification of the plant cell wall  <cit> . tmds have been found in some fungal gh <dig> β-glucanases from the basidiomycete, phanerochaete chrysosporiumi, and in plant proteins containing gh <dig> modules that are involved in plant cell wall modification  <cit> .figure  <dig>

gh <dig> is the third largest cazyme family in p. parasitica with  <dig> members . many fungal phytopathogens also have large gh <dig> families . gh <dig> proteins act on disaccharides and on the non-reducing end of a range of polysaccharides to release single residues such as glucose or xylose   <cit> . gh <dig> proteins may also be involved in the degradation and processing of agps  <cit> . an alignment of  <dig> similar-sized p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins showed that they had little overall homology  but these proteins could be grouped into four subfamilies, with members of each subfamily sharing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 55% amino acid identity. comparisons with enzymes with known activities did not provide any clues as to the specific substrate of each gh <dig> subfamily.figure  <dig>

fungal gh <dig> families contain only a few members whereas most oomycetes sequenced to date have large gh <dig> families . p. parasitica contains  <dig> predicted gh <dig> proteins. sequence alignments allowed the p. parasitica gh <dig> family to be divided into three subfamilies. the sequences of  <dig> p. parasitica proteins  in one subfamily were similar to an 85 kda β-glucosidase/xylosidase from p. infestans designated bgx <dig>  with one protein, pptg_ <dig>  sharing 81% identity . bgx <dig> releases terminal β-glucose residues, and to a lesser extent β-xylose residues, from artificial substrates, suggesting that this group of p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins is likely to be involved in the release of glucose residues from β- <dig> -linked glucans in both cellulose and xyloglucans. the other two subfamilies of p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins act on hemicellulose and agps and will be dealt with in a later section.

the gh <dig> cazyme family is diverse. it includes endo-β- <dig> -glucanases, β- <dig> -cellobiosidases, endo-β- <dig> -mannanases, exo-β- <dig> -glucosidases, endo-β- <dig> -galactanases and β- <dig> -glucanases and is one of the largest gh families in many symbiotic, biotrophic, hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi. for example, the biotroph puccinia triticina contains  <dig> gh <dig> cazymes , the hemibiotroph colletotrichum higginsianum contains  <dig> gh <dig> cazymes  and the necrotroph stagonospora nodorum contains  <dig> . in p. parasitica, gh <dig> is one of the two largest cwde families. the  <dig> gh <dig> proteins  represent 9% of p. parasitica gh cazymes; similar numbers of gh <dig> proteins are found in other characterised oomycete species  <cit> . all p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins are potentially secreted, three contain gpi anchors  and  <dig> contain tmds . because the main microfibrillar component in cell walls of phytophthora and other oomycete species is cellulose  <cit> , rather than chitin as in fungi, these membrane-anchored endoglucanases may be involved in pathogen wall modification as proposed for fungal gh5_ <dig> proteins  <cit> . ten gh <dig> proteins appear to be endo-β- <dig> -glucanases, including eight  that are homologous to gh5_ <dig> subfamily proteins from other phytophthora species  <cit> . p. parastica gh5_ <dig> proteins contain a tmd at the predicted n-terminus. three gh <dig> proteins also contain a cbm <dig> module  and are similar to previously identified proteins in the stamenophile-specific gh5_ <dig> subfamily of exo-β- <dig> -glucanases . while not all members of this subfamily have a cbm <dig> module, its presence would provide affinity for β- <dig> -glucans  <cit> . six other gh <dig> proteins were identified as potential β- <dig> -glucosidases  but had limited homology to the gh5_ <dig> proteins.

endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activity also occurs in gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families . all seven p. parasitica gh <dig>  five gh <dig>   <dig> full-length gh <dig> and all five gh <dig> proteins have features for non-classical secretion or signal peptides directing secretion. the gh <dig> proteins share many conserved residues, including those found in dual-action endoglucanase-cellobiohydrolases  <cit> . gh <dig> enzymes act at the non-reducing end of the polysaccharide chain. the five p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins share 29% amino acid identity and contain the exdxxe motif typical of the gh <dig> family  <cit> . the gh <dig> family includes cellobiohydrolases that release the disaccharide cellobiose from the reducing end of cellulose chains, endo-β- <dig> -glucanases and β- <dig> - <dig>  glucanases. sequence alignment showed that the gh <dig> proteins could be split into two subfamilies but specific functions could not be assigned to individual gh <dig> proteins, although two  sharing 71% amino acid identity showed sequence similarities with β- <dig> : <dig>  glucanases from bispora sp.  and the other three showed more similarity to endoglucanases from trichoderma reesei
 <cit> . using sequence data from two orthologous genes  from another p. parasitica isolate to predict full-length versions of truncated proteins in the inra- <dig> isolate, the  <dig> p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins were shown to contain the six gh <dig> consensus boxes described in goedegebuur et al.
 <cit> . p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins shared 19-100% pairwise amino acid identity and this sequence diversity is similar to that seen in fungal gh <dig> endoglucanases  <cit> . while the gh <dig> family includes proteins with endo-β- <dig> -glucanase, xyloglucanase, β- <dig> - <dig> -glucanase and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase activity, sequence analysis suggests that the gh <dig> proteins from phytophthora will hydrolyse β- <dig> -glucan chains in cellulose or xyloglucans. master and coworkers  <cit>  have shown that p. sojae and p. ramorum gh <dig> proteins are closely related to a xyloglucan-specific endo-β- <dig> -glucanase gh <dig> from aspergillus. p. parasitica contains five proteins from the recently identified gh <dig> family. the few members of this family that been characterised have a number of enzyme activities and can act on β- <dig> -linked glucans as well as terminal β- <dig> - and β- <dig> -linked glucans  <cit> .

auxiliary redox enzymes
recent research has led to the addition of the aa family of cazymes to the original five gh, pl, ce, cbm and gt families within the cazy database  <cit> . currently there are  <dig> aa families listed in the cazy database  <cit> , some of which are polysaccharide oxygenases which are ostensibly involved in lignin breakdown but which also target cellulose in lignocellulose  <cit> . p. parasitica has  <dig> potentially secreted proteins from four aa families. enzymes with aa <dig> modules are iron reductases, providing reactive oxygen species to assist in cellulose chain degradation  <cit> . three p. parasitica proteins contain an aa <dig> module and share 42% identity . although aa <dig> proteins typically also contain a c-terminal cbm <dig> module, thought to bring the enzyme and its reaction product close to the cellulose molecule  <cit> , this motif did not occur in any p. parasitica aa <dig> proteins.

aa <dig>  and aa <dig>  families contain copper-dependent monooxygenases  <cit> . both aa <dig> and aa <dig> enzymes directly target cellulose, oxidatively cleaving the glucose chains within the cellulose microfibrils  <cit> . aa <dig> enzymes are thought to oxidize the c <dig>  c <dig> or c <dig> carbons in the glucose rings of the cellulose chains  <cit> . the action of aa <dig> and aa <dig> enzymes makes the cellulose more susceptible to attack by other cazymes. aa <dig> proteins have been identified in a number of fungal genomes, with biotrophs containing only a few and hemibiotrophs and necrotrophs containing large aa <dig> families. c. higginsianum, for example, has  <dig> aa <dig> cazymes  <cit> . to date, aa <dig> proteins have been predominantly found in bacteria and less commonly in eukaryotes  <cit> . the single aa <dig> and four aa <dig> copper-dependent monooxygenases in p. parasitica  have a high degree of similarity, sharing 42-61% pairwise identity. this sequence similarity suggests that the four genes may have arisen from a single progenitor gene through gene duplication. examination of the p. parasitica scaffolds revealed that one aa <dig> and the sole aa <dig> gene are adjacent, a feature consistent with relatively recent gene duplication. p. parasitica also contains five secreted oxidases from the aa <dig> family. this family targets mono- and disaccharides and acts on a wide variety of substrates including cellobiose and α- <dig> -linked glycopyranosyl residues  <cit> .

cellulose-associated cbms
cbms are usually auxiliary domains that occur within proteins in conjunction with other cazyme modules  <cit> . it is believed that the function of cbm modules is to bring the cazyme into close and sustained proximity to the substrate of the catalytic cazyme modules in the enzyme, thereby increasing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme  <cit> . there are over  <dig> families of cbms and they have been classified into three types  according to the nature of their substrates   <cit> .

the p. parasitica genome contains  <dig> genes encoding proteins that have cbms that bind to cellulose . all contain signals for secretion with two containing gpi anchors . seventeen proteins belong to the cbm <dig> family and  <dig> to the cbm <dig> family. both cbm <dig> and cbm <dig> are type a cbm families that bind to crystalline cellulose  <cit> .

of the  <dig> p. parasitica cbm <dig> proteins, eight were identified by dbcan analysis  and the other nine by blast searches and confirmed as cbm <dig> proteins by cat analysis . pairwise comparisons show that they share little sequence similarity but most appear to contain at least one copy of a domain similar to previously identified fungal cellulose binding domains  <cit> . the cellulose-binding and lectin-like activity of one p. parasitica cbm <dig> protein has been demonstrated experimentally . cbel is one of five proteins  that have two cbm <dig> domains. although only five cbm <dig> proteins have been recognised in the genome of p. infestans
 <cit> , the much larger number of cbm <dig> proteins in p. parasitica is similar to that found in hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi  <cit> .

the  <dig> p. parasitica cbm <dig> proteins share 15-76% pairwise identity. they also contain amino acid signature sequences diagnostic of expansin-like proteins which function in the regulation of plant cell wall expansion  <cit> . six of the cbm <dig> proteins  also have a single tmd situated at the c-terminus and one  has two cbm <dig> domains. unlike cbm <dig> proteins, the cbm <dig> family in p. parasitica is much larger than those found in biotrophic, hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungal pathogens  <cit> .

one of the interesting aspects of the cellulose-targeting cbm-containing proteins in p. parasitica is the fact that the cbm <dig> and cbm <dig> modules are not accompanied by catalytic modules. this is an unusual situation, only infrequently observed in cazyme proteins  <cit> . published reports on the cwde complement of fungal plant pathogens have not focused on the modular structure of specific cazyme proteins. however, an analysis of the  <dig> cbm1-containing proteins in c. graminicola revealed only a single protein containing a cbm <dig> and no other module  <cit> .

hemicellulose degrading families
hemicelluloses are complex heterogeneous polysaccharides defined by their solubility properties and include xyloglucans, xylans and mannans  <cit> . xyloglucans are the most abundant form of hemicellulose in non-graminaceous plants. they have a backbone of β- <dig> -linked glucose subunits, up to 75% of which may be branched with an α- <dig> -xylose residue . the side branches may be further elaborated by β- <dig> -galactose and α- <dig> -fucose substitutions. xylans have a backbone of β- <dig> -linked xylose subunits and can exist as simple unbranched chains or can contain many different side chains. in glucuronoxylans these branches are α- <dig> -linked glucuronic acid subunits and in glucuronoarabinoxylans, the branches are arabinose or glucuronic acid subunits . mannans possess a backbone of β- <dig> -linked mannose residues and may include occasional glucose residues to form glucomannans. backbone subunits may bear side chains of α- <dig> -linked galactose residues forming galactomannans and galactoglucomannans . hemicelluloses are often acetylated and sometimes linked by esterification to feruloyl or coumaroyl residues  <cit> . hemicelluloses are degraded by cazymes that digest the xyloglucan, xylan or mannan backbones and that cleave the diversity of substitutions. activity for the degradation of hemicellulose has been described in at least  <dig> gh families and nine ce families  <cit> . in p. parasitica the degradation of hemicellulose potentially involves members of  <dig> gh and five ce families as well as non-catalytic cbms.

hemicellulose-targeting ghs
cleavage of the xyloglucan backbone is achieved by the action of β- <dig> -endoglucanases and β- <dig> -glucosidases which occur in a number of gh families . in p. parasitica, the gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families include proteins that act on xyloglucan backbones  <cit> . breakage of the β- <dig> -linked glucans can also be achieved by xyloglucan-specific endo-β- <dig> -glucanases from the diverse gh <dig> family  <cit> . the gh <dig> family members also act on β- <dig> -galactans in agps, β- <dig> : <dig> -glucans and β- <dig> -glucans  <cit> . of the  <dig> p. parasitica proteins containing a gh <dig> module,  <dig> show a high degree of similarity and all but two  contain the gh <dig> signature catalytic motif exdxxe thought to be critical for xyloglucanase, galactanase and β- <dig> -glucanase activity  <cit> ; none contain the motif exdxe found in gh <dig> β- <dig> - <dig> -glucanases  <cit> . most proteins from this family contain two gh <dig> modules and are predicted to be secreted and/or contain a c terminal tmd . none of the p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins share significant homology to known endo-β- <dig> -galactanases  <cit> . the other two gh <dig> proteins lacking the exdxxe motif  show similarity to β- <dig> -glucanases and are discussed in the section on β- <dig> -glucan degradation.

the β- <dig> -linked xylose residues in the backbone of xylans, glucuronoxylans and glucuronoarabinoxylans are generally cleaved by endo-β- <dig> -xylanases found in gh <dig> and gh <dig>  and by exo-acting β- <dig> -xylanases  from gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families  <cit> . the p. parasitica genome encodes no xylan-specific gh <dig> proteins but does contain genes for four putative endo-β- <dig> -xylanases from the gh <dig> family . three of the four have an sp and share 45% amino acid identity, but the full sequence of the fourth protein could not be resolved . other xylanases belong to one of the gh <dig> family subgroups, previously described in the section on cellulose-targeting hydrolases. this group contains four proteins  sharing 31% pairwise identity, and includes a protein annotated as a β-xylosidase . this subgroup may thus be involved in the release of xylose residues from the end of xylans, glucuronoarabinoxylans and glucuronoxylans. xylanases and xylosidases are also found in the gh <dig> family . in p. parasitica there are seven gh <dig> proteins and the six full-length proteins share between 56% and 88% pairwise identity . however, these proteins share little homology to gh <dig> proteins involved in xyloglucan degradation  <cit> . proteins in the gh <dig> family can also degrade α- <dig> - and α- <dig> -linked arabinose-containing side chains  of hemicellulose, pectins and agps , and β- <dig> -galactan linkages in agps . the p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins have considerable similarity to other uncharacterised gh <dig> arabinan endo-α- <dig> -arabinosidases such as those from a. niger and myceliophthora thermophile . interestingly the expression of one predicted gh <dig>  is induced by arabinogalactan suggesting that the closely related gh43s from p. parasitica may be involved in the degradation of side chains and not the xylan backbone of unsubstituted xylans . xylosidases are also found in the gh <dig> family which is described in the pectinase section.figure  <dig>

the gh <dig> family, in addition to the cellulose acting β-glucosidase/xylosidases described earlier, also contains proteins that can release xylose from glucuronoarabinoxylans and act on hemicellulose side chains such as β- <dig> -glucanases and β-fucosidases, and endo-β- <dig> -galactanases and β-glucuronidases that degrade agps and pectins  <cit> . one p. parasitica group of gh <dig> contains five proteins  with the four full-length proteins sharing an overall 50% amino acid identity. members of this subfamily contain cbm <dig> domains , which have been shown in other organisms to associate with xylanases  <cit> . another group of p. parasitica gh30s contains six proteins , with five full-length proteins having up to 44% identity with a secreted endo-β- <dig> -galactanase from c. graminicola . this sequence similarity suggests that members of this subfamily of p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins, like their fungal counterparts  <cit> , may act on arabinose- and galactose-containing side chains  found in pectins  and agps .

putative p. parasitica enzymes with predicted activity against mannan-based hemicelluloses are found in the gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families. two proteins from the p. parasitica gh <dig> family have been annotated as endo-β- <dig> -mannosidases  and these share more similarity to characterised mannosidases  than to other p. parasitica gh5s. a single gh <dig> protein containing an sp  was identified and this protein had more residues in common with a β-mannosidase from a. nidulans  than to a β-galactosidase from xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris . β-galactosidases that have the potential to act at the terminal non-reducing end xyloglucan side chains can also be found in gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig>  and are described later. it is possible that the p. parasitica gh <dig> may also be involved in the degradation of n-linked oligosaccharides  by cleaving the β- <dig> -linkage between mannose and n-acetylglucosamine  <cit> .

hemicellulose-targeting ces
the formation of cross-links between hemicelluloses and cellulose is moderated by the presence of acetyl, methyl and phenolic groups on backbone and side chain residues in the hemicellulose molecule  <cit> . galactose residues in the backbones of xylans, glucuronoarabinoxylans and glucuronoxylans, and in the side chains of xyloglucans, galactomannans and galactoglucomannans can be acetylated and glucuronic acid residues can be methylated. ferulic acid and coumaric acid can be attached to arabinose residues in side chains in glucuronoxylans and glucuronoarabinoxylans . these modifications can be removed by ces  <cit> . there are currently eight known ce families with acetyl xylan esterase activity  and the p. parasitica genome contains members of five of these ce families .

the ce <dig> family includes acetyl xylan esterase and feruloyl esterase, as well as intracellular esterases, such as s-formylglutathione hydrolase  <cit> . in p. parasitica,  <dig> putative ce <dig> proteins were identified by dbcan with e-values between  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  and another four were found by homology searches of the p. parasitica genome. however, none of the  <dig> proteins had domains or lengths consistent with ce <dig> proteins as indicated by cat analysis. currently, 96% of the  <dig>  ce <dig> proteins listed in the cazy database  <cit>  are from bacteria, indicating that eukaryotes contain few ce <dig> proteins. three p. parasitica proteins, sharing 37% identity, contain the pfam domain pf <dig> for tannase and feruloyl esterase , but only one of these was identified as a ce <dig> protein by dbcan . these three proteins share 20-22% amino acid residues with a characterized feruloyl esterase from a. niger . interestingly, of the eight proteins annotated as tannase and feruloyl esterases in c. graminicola, only one has a ce <dig> domain  <cit> .

a small number of putative acetyl xylan esterases from ce <dig>  ce <dig>  ce <dig> and ce <dig> families were identified in the p. parasitica genome. ce <dig> proteins have a preference for acetyl groups on the carbon at the c6-position of the xylose ring while ce <dig> esterases remove acetyl groups from a number of carbons  <cit> . single acetyl xylan esterases were identified from the ce <dig> and ce <dig> families in p. parasitica. fungal pathogens studied to date tend to have small ce <dig> families but large ce <dig> families  <cit> . the p. parasitica ce <dig> protein did not have a classical or a non-classical sp but did have 40% identity with a putative ce <dig> from albugo laibachii  and 20% identity with a characterised ce <dig> from neocallimastix patriciarum . homologs to the single potentially secreted p. parasitica ce <dig> protein were identified in est libraries of mating cultures of p. infestans  and mycelia of p. capsici . genes encoding two potentially secreted ce <dig> proteins were found in the p. parasitica genome  but both had little homology to characterised ce <dig> proteins  <cit> . pptg_ <dig> contained an n-terminal tmd but pptg_ <dig> did not, suggesting that these enzymes serve different functions. ce <dig> proteins have broad specificity , acting on acetylated residues in xyloglucans and xylans and on n-acetylglucosamine in chitin and n-linked oligosaccharides  <cit> .

p. parasitica contains four ce <dig> proteins. ce <dig> acetyl xylan esterases act predominantly on acetyl groups on the c2-position of xylose residues such as those in glucuronoxylans   <cit> . after using est data to correct an apparent annotation error for one of these genes , all four p. parasitica ce <dig> proteins are predicted to be secreted. three proteins  shared 60% amino acid identity and had homology to characterised acetyl xylan esterases  protein, which is annotated as a lipase, does contain the cutinase consensus sequence. two predicted ce <dig> proteins  with dbcan values of  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> were identified . given that all characterized ce <dig> enzymes function in the cytoplasm, it seems unlikely that these two p. parasitica proteins are involved in the degradation of cell wall components  <cit> .

hemicellulose-targeting cbms
three families of cbms with putative hemicellulose binding properties, cbm <dig>  cbm <dig> and cbm <dig>  were identified in p. parasitica . in other organisms, cbm <dig> modules often accompany modules conveying endo-β- <dig> -xylanase activity  <cit>  but the one p. parasitica cbm <dig> protein lacks this or any other cazyme module. cbm <dig> modules often occur in multi-domain proteins that preferentially target β- <dig> -linked xylans but can bind to other polysaccharides  <cit> . four of the  <dig> p. parasitica proteins containing cbm <dig> modules also contain a gh <dig> module and are annotated as glycosphingolipid acting glucosylceramidases . the presence of the cbm <dig> modules may indicate a role for these proteins in the degradation of xylans rather than of glycosphingolipids. three proteins  contain a cbm <dig> and a gh <dig> module, suggesting that these may act on β- <dig> -glucans. the other four cbm <dig> proteins contain from one , three  to six  copies of the cbm <dig> module. one p. parasitica protein containing a cbm <dig> domain was identified . cbm <dig> domains have been shown to bind to a number of substrates including xylan and cellulose  <cit> . however pptg_ <dig> is predicted to have a molecular weight of over 600 kda and contains other domains not found in cwdes. this protein was thus not analysed further.

pectin degrading families
the pectin matrix of plant cell walls is constructed using three main highly complex polysaccharides, hg, rgi and rgii  <cit> . hg consists of unsubstituted chains of α- <dig> -linked-galacturonic acid residues . rgi has a backbone of alternating α- <dig> -rhamnosyl and α- <dig> -galacturonic acid residues with different side chains substituted onto the rhamnose residues . the side chains include α- <dig> -linked arabinans, which are in turn substituted with α- <dig> -arabinans, and arabinogalactans, which consist of β- <dig> -galactose substituted with α- <dig> -arabinans  <cit> . residues in hg and rgi can be methyl esterified or acetylated  <cit> . the highly complex rgiis are dimers of seven to nine α- <dig> -linked galacturonic acid residues. these backbones are highly substituted with oligosaccharides that include  <dig> different linkages and  <dig> different saccharides, forming a complex polysaccharide that is highly resistant to degradation  <cit> . the cazy database includes  <dig> cazyme families  involved in the degradation of pectins. the p. parasitica genome includes genes in  <dig> of these families .

pectin-targeting ghs
the hg chain of α- <dig> -linked galacturonic acid residues is cleaved by gh <dig> endo-polygalacturonases. the gh <dig> family also contains exo-polygalacturonosidases and enzymes acting on the backbone of α- <dig>  linked galacturonic acid and rhamnose residues in rgi. the p. parasitica genome contains  <dig> genes encoding secreted proteins from the gh <dig> family. all  <dig> proteins share a high degree of similarity, especially in the c-terminal half. alignment of  <dig> full-length gh <dig> proteins showed they share 30% identity. functional studies of eight p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins have demonstrated that they are endo-polygalacturonases  <cit> . in a. niger, the sequences of the endo-polygalacturonases are very different from those of exo-polygalacturonosidases and rhamnogalacturonases  suggesting that the  <dig> p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins all have endo-polygalacturonase activity.

in p. parasitica, proteins in two other gh families are likely to be involved in the degradation of the rgi backbone, namely gh <dig> and gh <dig>  gh <dig> enzymes specifically cleave the terminal non-reducing end α- <dig> -rhamnose  <cit>  while gh <dig> proteins are endo-acting enzymes that cleave the α- <dig>  bond between the galacturonan and rhamnose residues  <cit> . p. parasitica has four putative gh <dig> enzymes, three of which are very similar , and one gh <dig> 

nine gh families, gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig>  include proteins that have the potential to degrade rgi side chains. rhamnose residues in the rgi backbone are substituted with side chains of β- <dig> -linked galactan, α- <dig> - and α- <dig> -linked arabinan or branched type i arabinogalactans with small amounts of fucosyl, glucosyluronic acid and methyl β-glucosyluronic acid  <cit> . potentially, the gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families, described earlier, and gh <dig> , contain β-galactosidases that act on the terminal non-reducing end β- <dig> -linked galactose residues in xyloglucan  and rgi side chains  and some also act on the β- <dig> - and β- <dig> -linked galactans of agps   <cit> . unfortunately, sequence analysis has not helped determine the substrate specificity of the p. parasitica proteins in these five families.

p. parasitica has proteins in four cazyme families, gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig>  that include enzymes that target α- <dig> - and α- <dig> -linked arabinan or branched type i arabinogalactans. gh <dig> and gh <dig> have been described earlier. gh <dig> enzymes specifically cleave the β- <dig> -linked galactose residues in the arabinogalactan type i side chain of rgi. there are six p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins, of which two predicted proteins  may be misannotated because scaffold analysis suggests that they form a single protein. the four full-length proteins share 46% amino acid identity and contain two catalytic residues typically found in endo-β- <dig> -galactosidases  <cit> . enzymes in the gh <dig> family with α-l-arabinofuranosidase activity cleave the terminal α- <dig> - or α- <dig> - linked arabinose residues in glucuronoarabinoxylans  and in arabinogalactan side chains of rgi  and agps . there is a single secreted gh <dig> in p. parasitica and it differs from fungal gh <dig> proteins in that it does not contain a xylan specific cbm <dig> module  <cit> . this suggests that the p. parasitica gh <dig> protein, while sharing significant homology to the gh <dig> module from fungi , does not act on hemicellulose.

while an accurate estimation of the number of gh proteins involved in pectin degradation is difficult, analysis of fungal and oomycete genomes suggests that hemibiotrophs and necrotrophs contain more pectin-degrading enzymes than biotrophs . however, the cazyme families from which the pectin degrading gh proteins come differ between fungi and oomycetes. fungal pectinases occur in the gh <dig> and gh <dig> families but these two cazyme families are not represented in the oomycetes. both fungi and p. parasitica have pectinases in gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families but proteins in gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families are more abundant in oomycetes than in fungi whereas proteins in gh <dig> and gh <dig> families are more abundant in fungi. bacteria also have gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> pectinases but these families are not represented in fungi or oomycetes  <cit> .

polysaccharide lyases
cazyme activities that degrade pectins via β-elimination are grouped in  <dig> pl families  <cit> . the p. parasitica genome contains  <dig> pls and these occur in the pl <dig>  pl <dig> and pl <dig> families . all are predicted to be secreted and none contain tmds. both pl <dig> and pl <dig> families contain pectate lyases that cleave bonds linking the α- <dig> -galacturonan residues to the hg backbone at the non-reducing end. pl <dig> also contains enzymes that target unesterified α- <dig> -galacturonan residues at the reducing end  and esterified α- <dig> -galacturonan residues at the non-reducing end  of hg. pl <dig> proteins act on the rgi backbone, breaking the α- <dig>  glycosidic bonds between the alternating l-rhamnose and d-galacturonic acid residues. alignment of p. parasitica full-length pl <dig> proteins showed that they have a number of conserved residues, with pairwise identity ranging from 21% to 100%. two pl <dig> proteins from p. capsici, pcpel <dig> and pcpel <dig>  have been identified as pectate lyases, having activity against unesterified polygalacturonic acid   <cit> . pcpel <dig> has 74-90% amino acid identity with three p. parasitica pl1s  while pcpel <dig> has 87% identity with one p. parasitica pl <dig> , suggesting that these p. parasitica proteins will act on unesterified hg. the p. parasitica genome contains  <dig> putative pl <dig> proteins that show a high degree of homology in their n terminal half. there are six predicted p. parasitica pl <dig> proteins but misannotation may be splitting one protein into two . the four that are full-length share 51-83% amino acid identity and contain the highly conserved regions thought to be responsible for binding to deacetylated rgi  <cit> .

although the number of cazyme families that contain pl enzymes is similar in the oomycete and fungal phytopathogens that have been examined, the numbers of pl proteins in p. parasitica and other phytophthora species is more than twice that in necrotropic pythium species  <cit>  and considerably larger than in fungi . a similar situation is seen in the pectin degrading ce families.

pectin-targeting ces
the three p. parasitica ce families that are not involved in hemicellulose degradation contain enzymes that are predicted to remove the methyl and acetyl groups from pectins . the single activity of ce <dig> proteins is to remove methyl groups from the α- <dig> -galacturonic acid residues in hg  <cit> . ce <dig> proteins remove the acetyl group from galacturonic acid residues in hg and rgi, and ce <dig> proteins remove the acetyl group from hg only . p. parasitica has  <dig> proteins in the ce <dig> family . alignments of these proteins showed that they have 28% amino acid identity overall and 54-100% identity in pairwise comparisons. p. infestans and p. sojae have  <dig> and  <dig> ce <dig> proteins, respectively. by contrast, pythium species examined to date have no ce <dig> proteins  <cit> . de-esterification by ce <dig> proteins is thought to be essential for subsequent degradation of hg by gh <dig> proteins  <cit> .

there are  <dig> ce <dig> and six ce <dig> proteins in p. parasitica, making these families larger in p. parasitica than in fungal plant pathogens. only a few fungal phytopathogens contain any ce <dig> proteins although they do occur in plants . the sequence of the  <dig> p. parasitica ce <dig> proteins is highly variable  but all contain rgi acetyl esterase signature amino acid residues  <cit> . sequence analysis revealed 18-74% pairwise amino acid identity, and an n-terminal tmd in another five proteins, and all are predicted to be secreted. together, these data suggest there may be some functional differences within the p. parasitica ce <dig> family. the six ce <dig> proteins contain classical secretion signals and share between 38-68% amino acid identity in pairwise alignments. one ce <dig> protein  contains a predicted gpi anchor so it may have a different function to that of the other five ce <dig> enzymes.

pectin-targeting cbms
one protein containing cbm <dig> was identified in p. parasitica. cbm <dig> modules can interact with pga and can be associated with n-acetylglucosaminidase modules  <cit> . cbm <dig> modules are found in many fungal species but, as in p. parasitica, are present in relatively low numbers of proteins.

β- <dig> -glucan degradation
p. parasitica contains three gh families, gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig>  that include proteins with predicted endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activity. of the  <dig> proteins in the gh <dig> family,  <dig> are predicted to act on hemicellulose or β- <dig> -glucans . of the two remaining gh <dig> proteins, pptg_ <dig> has homology to tos1-like proteins . tos <dig> proteins have some similarity to known β- <dig> -glucanases and mutation of the tos <dig> gene from s. cerevisiae results in altered glycogen levels and wall modification  <cit> . the other gh <dig> protein  has a dbcan value of  <dig> e- <dig> and has some homology to pptg_ <dig> and to non-cazyme carboxypeptidases. there are  <dig> proteins in the gh <dig> family in p. parasitica, three of which  also contain a cbm <dig> module. all but one of the full-length proteins are predicted to be secreted with two also containing a tmd at the c-terminus . the gh <dig> proteins lack the exdxxe and eestsed signature sequences found in gh <dig> and gh <dig> β- <dig> -glucanases  <cit> . all full-length proteins, while sharing little overall similarity, could be divided into subgroups and a ncbi blastp analysis showed that all contained a cog <dig> domain found in exo-β- <dig> -glucanases  <cit> . the gh <dig> family contains  <dig> proteins identified as endo-β- <dig> -glucanases. an alignment of the gh <dig> proteins  showed high sequence conservation in some regions and the presence of the eestsed endo-β- <dig> -glucanase signature motif  <cit> . gh <dig> and gh <dig> but not gh <dig> families are considerably larger in phytophthora species than in other phytopathogens  <cit> , a feature that may indicate a role other than degradation of the plant cell wall. these enzymes could, for example, be involved in the modification of β- <dig> -glucans in phytophthora walls  <cit> .

a fourth cazyme family whose members may be involved in remodeling β- <dig> -glucans via hydrolase and transferase activity is gh <dig>  <cit> . p. parasitica has  <dig> gh <dig> proteins, a number at least twice that in fungal species examined to date  <cit> . the overall similarity between p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins is low, although five proteins share 24% amino acid identity and contain a gpi anchor, a feature typically seen in gh <dig> proteins from other organisms  <cit> .

putative chitinases
chitin is a polymer of n-acetyl-glucosamine residues and constitutes the main microfibrillar component of fungal cell walls and the exoskeletons of arthropods and insects. chitinases act on the n-acetyl-β- <dig> -glucosaminide linkage in both chitin and glycoproteins  <cit> . p. parasitica contains proteins from two gh families that include members with chitinase activity. three proteins belong to the gh <dig> family, members of which have chitinase or endo-n-acetyl-β- <dig> -glucosaminidase activity, or even inhibit xylanase activity  <cit> . the two full-length p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins share only 12% amino acid identity and show similarity to mammalian, but not to plant chitinases. however, all three proteins contain regions with homology to the gh <dig> and gh <dig> binding sites in xylanase inhibitors such as xip- <dig> from triticum aestivum . the function of these gh <dig> proteins is thus unclear. gh <dig> family proteins characterised to date have chitinase, β-n-acetylglucosaminidase or lysozyme activity  <cit> . the two p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins are almost identical, and have sequence homology with plant chitinases. they have, for example, 27-29% pairwise amino acid identity to a chitinase from medicago sativa .

the p. parasitica genome also encodes proteins with two cbm modules  that confer chitin binding  <cit> . one p. parasitica protein has two cbm <dig> modules and an sp. in other organisms, cbm <dig> modules often accompany gh <dig> modules in chitinases  <cit>  but this was not the case in p. parasitica. three proteins had either one  or three  cbm <dig> modules and two are predicted to be secreted by the non-classical pathway . pptg_ <dig> was considerably larger than the other two cbm <dig> proteins and also contained two fibronectin type iii domains, which are associated with mammalian extracellular proteins, and a lysm motif, which is known to bind peptidoglycans and chitin  <cit> . homologs of this cbm <dig> protein are restricted to the stramenopiles.

degradation of other n-acetylated polysaccharides and glycoproteins
the p. parasitica genome encodes proteins from  <dig> gh families that include enzymes involved in cleavage of non-chitinaceous n-acetylated polysaccharides and glycoproteins, some of which have been described in other sections . there is one representative in the gh <dig> family of putative glycoprotein-acting α-mannosidases  <cit> . there are five gh <dig> proteins, four of which are predicted to be secreted . gh <dig> proteins are associated with modification or degradation of glycoproteins containing α- <dig> -linked mannose residues  <cit> . two of the p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins have 33% identity  but the other three are disimilar. one protein belonging to the gh <dig> family of α-glucosidases is predicted to be secreted, contained an n-terminal tmd and the three catalytic residues typical of α-glucosidases involved in n-glycan processing  <cit> .

proteins in the gh <dig> family are predicted to have endo-β-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity, to act on asn-linked glycopeptides and to cleave between mannose and n-acetylglucosamine  <cit> . p. parasitica contains one gh <dig> protein which lacks an sp and two exo-α-d-n-acetylglucosaminidases with an sp in the gh <dig> family. in clostridium perfringens, proteins from this relatively uncharacterised family act on α-n-acetylglucosamine-β- <dig> -d-galactose residues  <cit> . in plants, these residues are found in inositol-glycosphingolipids  <cit> . seven p. parasitica proteins with conserved domains typical of oxidoreductase  grouped within the gh <dig> family which is associated with α-n-acetylgalactosaminidase activity  <cit> . one p. parasitica protein  had a gh <dig> module associated with glycosphingolipid β-n-acetylgalactosaminidase activity and thought to act on terminal α-linked n-acetylgalactosamine units from o-glycoproteins. the p. parasitica gh <dig> protein lacked an sp but contained a motif whose score was only slightly below the threshold for non-classical secretion as determined by secrotomep.

degradation of starch
starch molecules contain α- <dig> -linked glucans with α- <dig>  branch points. the α- <dig> -linked glucan chains are cleaved by endo-acting amylase or by α-glucosidase acting on the terminal, non-reducing end to release d-glucose. p. parasitica contains proteins in five cazyme families with modules associated with the degradation of starch. the families are gh <dig>  <cit> , gh <dig>  <cit> , cbm <dig>  <cit> , cbm <dig>  <cit>  and cbm <dig>  <cit> . these families have been included in the current study because most contain proteins that are predicted to be secreted  and may act on substrates other than starch. for example, α-mannosidases from the gh <dig> family could be involved maturation of glycoproteins  <cit> .

two p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins were identified. one contains the α-amylase catalytic domain, an sp and an n-terminal starch-binding cbm <dig> domain. a cbm <dig> domain was also found in one of the ten gh <dig> p. parasitica proteins . the gh <dig> proteins could be divided into five subfamilies based on sequence homologies. excluding two potentially truncated proteins, one group of three share 68% amino acid identity , pptg_ <dig> and  <dig> share 70% identity, another two have 87% amino acid identity  and one protein shared only limited homology . nine of the gh <dig> proteins are predicted to be secreted and one of these  has a predicted tmd at the c-terminus. all proteins aligned with different groups of α-glucosidases identified by blastp searches of ncbi, indicating they probably act in the degradation of starch. however they all shared some residues  with a characterised α-xylosidase from cellvibrio japonicus
 <cit> , leaving open the possibility that some of the p. parasitica gh <dig> family may act on terminal α-linked xylose residues of xyloglucans .

the final protein which may be involved in starch degradation contains both a cbm <dig> and a fucose-binding cbm <dig> module . this is a cazyme module combination that has not been previously described in any other organism. initially, five cbm20/cbm <dig> proteins were identified by the dbcan analysis with e-values between  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  however, blast analysis showed that two of the five have more homology to regulator-chromosome condensation proteins than to known cazymes. the remaining three proteins , contain other domains not associated with cazymes. pptg_ <dig>  for example, contains a discoidin domain found in an adhesion protein from dictyostelium discoideum
 <cit> .

other possible cwdes
the p. parasitica genome contains six proteins in the gh <dig> family which includes enzymes with invertase, exo-inulinase, levanase and fructan exohydrolase activity  <cit> . the p. parasitica gh <dig> proteins were almost identical to p. infestans invertases characterised by judelson and coworkers  <cit> . two p. parasitica α,α-trehalases in the gh <dig> family both contain an sp, suggesting that they act on an extracellular source of trehalose  to release glucose.

two proteins containing cbm <dig> or cbm <dig> modules were identified. few fungi contain cbm <dig> proteins and both cbm <dig> and cbm <dig> modules are poorly characterised  <cit> . two p. parasitica proteins had cbm <dig> modules. cbm <dig> proteins have been found in a few fungi, but in bacteria this module has been found in sialidases  <cit> .

comparison of the complement of cwdes in p. parasiticawith that in p. infestans
as a comparative exercise, we have applied our bioinformatic strategy for the identification of cwdes to the p. infestans genome  <cit> . a summary of the numbers of carbohydrate-active proteins identified in p. parasitica and p. infestans in the current study is presented in table  <dig>  cazyme families and cazyme modules were initially identified using dbcan, blast, keyword and domain searches . subsequent detailed bioinformatic analysis of individual proteins revealed that some cazymes were cytoplasmic proteins or had alternative enzyme activities and were thus not cwdes. removal of these proteins from the pool of candidate cwdes meant that the number of cwde families is less than the number of cazyme families in each class of enzymes. our data show that the numbers of cwde families and cwde proteins in each cazyme class are remarkably similar in p. parasitica and p. infestans. comparison of our data with those from three other recent p. infestans studies  exemplifies the variation in cazyme annotation achieved following different approaches. the time at which the analysis is done is also an important factor. for example, the aa class of cazymes has only relatively recently been included within the cazy database  <cit>  and this explains the absence of data for aa families in the earlier p. infestans studies. the time at which the analysis is conducted also affects the results because of continuing changes in the annotation of the genome sequence data. in terms of the numbers of cbm, ce, gh, gt and pl cazyme families, the numbers in the four studies are quite similar.table  <dig>

in the current study, cazyme families and cazyme modules were initially identified using dbcan, blast, keyword and domain searches. subsequent in-depth bioinformatic analyses of individual genes indicated that some cazymes were unlikely to be true cwdes, leading to a lower number of cwde families than cazyme families. our data show that the numbers of cwde families and cwde proteins in each cazyme class are remarkably similar in p. parasitica and p. infestans. comparison of our p. infestans data with those from the other p. infestans studies exemplify the variation in cazyme annotation achieved following different approaches and conducted at different times.



CONCLUSIONS
searches of the p. parasitica genome using dbcan and blast identified  <dig> genes that potentially encode cwdes. the  <dig> proteins contain  <dig> different cazyme modules. together, this cohort of  <dig> cwdes has the capacity to provide p. parasitica with the ability to degrade all major plant cell wall components. in the study reported in the present paper, each of the  <dig> cwde candidates was subjected to an in-depth bioinformatic analysis, with the goal of determining its enzymatic activity and possible substrate. despite the difficulties in interpreting function from primary protein sequence, this individualized attention has not only highlighted annotation errors that are being perpetuated in successive studies but has also allowed the likely enzyme activity and targeted substrate to be deduced for many p. parasitica cwdes.

in order to function in plant cell wall degradation, pathogen enzymes must be secreted and move through the pathogen cell wall to gain access to the plant cell wall. most  of the  <dig> putative p. parasitica cwde had a classical secretion sp at their n-terminus. a further  <dig>  had sequences associated with non-classical protein secretion. only  <dig>  proteins, for which full-length sequence data were available, lacked any form of secretion sequence. although initially controversial, the secretion of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins lacking a classical signal peptide is now well documented  <cit> . to date, no simple motif associated with non-classical secretion has been found but together a set of about six features of the amino acid sequence allow prediction of non-classical secretion  <cit> . most non-classical secretory proteins are constitutively secreted but a number of mammalian proteins that undergo regulated secretion have also been shown to follow a non-classical pathway  <cit> . information from studies of the role of non-classical secretion of cwdes is not yet available.

one hundred of the proteins with, plus an additional one without, secretion sequences, contained a tmd or a gpi anchor. while on the one hand, possession of tmds or gpi anchors may anchor the protein to the p. parasitica plasma membrane, recent evidence indicates that proteins with these motifs can be released from the membrane  <cit> . in some cases, modification of the gpi anchor results in binding of the protein to polysaccharides  <cit> . biotrophic pathogens are known to have significantly fewer cwdes than hemibiotrophs and necrotrophs, but there is little understanding of the protein attributes that might limit the movement of cwdes and hence the degree of tissue maceration. it is known that the ph of the wall and isoelectric point of cwdes will affect their mobility  <cit> . perhaps modification of gpi anchors on cwdes might be another means to regulate their movement within the plant cell wall.

the majority  of p. parasitica cwdes contain a single cazyme module. only  <dig> p. parasitica cwdes have modules of different types and  <dig> have multiple copies of the same module. this situation is in contrast to that in fungal phytopathogens where, for example, proteins that contain a cbm module usually also include a catalytic module  <cit> . the significance of the presence of so few proteins containing both cbm and catalytic cazyme modules in terms of p. parasitica pathogenicity remains to be determined, however, a cbm <dig> gene  is one of the most highly expressed genes during the infection of a susceptible host plant .

previous comparative studies of cwdes in phytopathogenic fungi have shown that the complement of enzymes in terms of the cazyme families represented and the numbers of proteins within a particular family are often very different in different organisms. the results of our characterization of the cwde complement in p. parasitica add further data to extend this observation, and highlight some especially interesting differences between p. parasitica, or the oomycetes in general, and fungal phytopathogens. the cbm cazyme class is a case in point. in p. parasitica, as in p. ramorum and p. sojae, of the total of 55- <dig> cbm proteins, about 25% belong to cbm <dig> and 25% to the cbm <dig> families, members of which bind to cellulose. within hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungal species, apart from cbms that target chitin, cbm <dig> is consistently the largest cbm family, often containing 25-50% of the total non-chitin-directed cbms  <cit> . in contrast to the situation in phytophthora species, there are usually only 1- <dig> cbm <dig> proteins in these fungi.

another striking difference between p. parasitica and fungal phytopathogens is presented by the complements of enzymes that degrade pectin. the degradation of pectin is thought to be the first step in a cascade of cwde activity  <cit> . pectin degradation may increase wall porosity and expose other wall polysaccharides, thereby facilitating the action of other pathogen enzymes. a broad spectrum of pectin-degrading enzymes is believed to be required in order to degrade the diversity of pectins found in plant cell walls  <cit> . around 25%  of p. parasitica cwdes are directed solely towards pectin degradation and this number increases to 50%  if proteins in families with multiple targets are included. of the pectin-directed enzymes in p. parasitica,  <dig> are pls and  <dig> are ces. similar numbers occur in other phytophthora species  <cit> . this situation may be compared to that in the fungi which typically have fewer than  <dig> pls and  <dig> ces . in fungal pathogens, the pectin degrading enzymes are predominantly gh proteins .

a third interesting comparison between oomycete and fungal pathogens concerns the numbers of cwdes directed towards the degradation of β- <dig> -glucans. the deposition of β- <dig> -glucans, in the form of callose, is an integral part of the basal plant defence response , and thus an ability to degrade callose could be an important attribute for successful infection. the p. parasitica genome contains  <dig> gh <dig> and  <dig> gh <dig> proteins that are thought to specifically degrade β- <dig> -glucans. fungal phytopathogens studied to date, on the other hand, have 1- <dig> gh <dig> and 0- <dig> gh <dig> proteins . these fungi may have up to about  <dig> or  <dig> β- <dig> -glucanases in gh <dig> and gh <dig> families, respectively. phytophthora cell walls themselves contain β- <dig> -glucans  <cit> , so perhaps some of the p. parasitica β- <dig> -glucanases are involved in pathogen wall modifications. however, it is still pertinent to ask if the larger numbers of β- <dig> -glucanases in the oomycetes mean that these organisms are better equipped to degrade the callose that is rapidly deposited in wall appositions at the infection site? an answer to this, and many other questions on cwde function, requires further information, in particular that arising from transcriptome and protein localization studies.
