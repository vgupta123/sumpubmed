BACKGROUND
helicases are highly conserved ubiquitous motor proteins involved in almost all the nucleic acid metabolic processes. they unwind nucleic acid duplexes with affiliated ntp hydrolysis and play essential roles in replication, dna repair, recombination, transcription, translation, pre-mrna processing and rna degradation  <cit> . helicases are crucial tools for machinery of the cell. most helicases contain conserved helicase motifs which are grouped together for the enzymatic and other functions  <cit> .

the product of the suv <dig>  gene was first described in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . this gene encodes a dna/rna helicase belonging to the ski <dig> family of dexh/d-box helicases. the human nuclear suv <dig> gene  encodes an ntp-dependent rna/dna helicase , which is related to the dexh/d  super family. the gene has been conserved during evolution and is present in purple bacteria, plants, c. elegans, drosophila, mammals and in all eukaryotes  <cit> . in humans the hsuv <dig> protein is localized predominantly in the mitochondrial matrix  <cit> . the human hsuv <dig> protein is also present in the cell nucleus and was found to have several interacting partners: hbxip  <cit> , blm helicase, and wrn helicase  <cit> . hsuv3p has been reported to unwind both dna and rna duplexes and dna/rna hybrids and its activity towards dna is much stronger  <cit> . it was reported that the hsuv <dig> helicase interacts with replication protein a and flap endonuclease  <dig> in the nucleus  <cit> . the yeast suv <dig> has been reported to be involved in rna turnover, mtdna replication and maintenance of mtdna stability  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge there are very few reports on plant suv <dig>  it was reported that nuclear-encoded arabidopsis thaliana suv <dig>  is localized in arabidopsis mitochondria and possesses atpase activity  <cit> . in a recent study we have reported that ossuv <dig> dual helicase functions in salinity stress tolerance by maintaining photosynthesis and antioxidant machinery in rice   <cit> . earlier we reported only presence of helicase and atpase activities in the ossuv <dig> protein but the detail characterization has not been reported yet. here we report extensive characterization of ossuv <dig> helicase. in this study a fresh batch of recombinant suv <dig> protein from oryza sativa  was purified to homogeneity and characterized in detail using biochemical assays. atpase assay in the presence of either dna or rna was performed and ossuv <dig> exhibits atp hydrolyzing properties. the ossuv <dig> contains the dna and rna binding and dna and rna helicase activities. ossuv <dig> exhibits bidirectional dna unwinding activity and is unable to unwind the blunt-end dna duplex substrate. the detailed ossuv <dig> helicase kinetics was performed and the km values are  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm for dna helicase and rna helicase, respectively. this study will be helpful in understanding the biochemical properties of ossuv <dig> protein.

RESULTS
purification of ossuv <dig> protein
the expression clone corresponding to ossuv <dig> was transformed into e. coli strain bl <dig>  plyss and a fresh batch of his-tagged recombinant protein of 67 kda  was purified as described earlier  <cit> . the purified protein was confirmed by western blotting with anti-his antibodies . this purified protein was used for all the characterization as described in the following sections.

characterization of atpase activity of ossuv <dig> protein
the concentration-dependence of ssdna-dependent atpase activity was checked by using  <dig> to  <dig> nm of ossuv <dig> protein and the percent release of radioactive inorganic phosphate  from  atp was measured. the results clearly show that ossuv <dig> contains concentration-dependent atpase activity in presence of ssdna . in order to study the time dependence of atpase activity, the atpase reaction using  <dig> nm of purified ossuv <dig> at different time points was done. the percent release of radioactive pi from  atp showed linearity up to 60 minutes and the activity did not increase further on increasing the time of incubation . the atpase activity was also checked in the presence of rna using the same concentrations of ossuv <dig>  it is interesting to note that ossuv <dig> also exhibits rna-dependent atpase activity in concentration and time-dependent manner .figure  <dig>

almost all the helicases have specific nucleotide requirement and the hydrolysis of nucleotide is tightly coupled to unwinding activity. therefore the helicase activity of ossuv <dig> protein  was measured with different nucleotide and deoxynucleotide triphosphates . the activity was maximum in presence of atp and datp . although to some extent ossuv <dig> also showed little unwinding activity in the presence of other dntps and ntps such as utp, dttp, ctp, dctp, gtp and dgtp  but ossuv <dig> did not show any unwinding activity in the absence of any ntp or dntp . the concentration requirement using atp showed that the unwinding activity of ossuv <dig>  was maximal at  <dig>  mm atp concentration and it did not increase further on increasing the atp concentration to  <dig>  mm . the specificity of ossuv <dig> was further determined by checking its dna unwinding activity with blunt-ended duplex dna substrate. this substrate has same duplex length  and identical core sequence as the hanging tails substrate but had blunt ends so that as far as possible, any differences in efficiency of unwinding due to sequence differences could be eliminated. the results clearly indicate that ossuv <dig> protein is unable to unwind the blunt-ended duplex substrate .

determination of direction of unwinding of ossuv <dig> protein
in a duplex dna most of the helicases preferentially unwind in a polar fashion by moving unidirectionally on the bound strand. the strand to which the enzyme binds and moves defines the direction of unwinding by a helicase. the unwinding activity of purified ossuv <dig> was tested by using the direction-specific substrates, one specific for the 3’ to 5’  and the other for the 5’ to 3’ direction . using both the direction-specific substrates the dna unwinding activity of different concentrations  of ossuv <dig> was determined. the release of radiolabelled dna fragment from the substrate of figure 3a by ossuv <dig> enzyme will indicate the movement in 3’ to 5’ direction. the results show that ossuv <dig> is able to show the activity with the 3’ to 5’ direction-specific substrate in a concentration and time-dependent manner . by using 5’ to 3’ direction-specific duplex substrate  the ossuv <dig> also shows 5’ to 3” direction-specific activity in a concentration and time-dependent manner . the results indicate that ossuv <dig> protein contains bidirectional dna unwinding activity.figure  <dig>

determination of rna helicase activity of ossuv <dig> protein
using different concentrations of ossuv <dig> protein and the partially duplex rna-rna substrate, the rna helicase activity was checked. the results indicate that ossuv <dig> protein  contains concentration-dependent rna-unwinding activity . the unwinding activity was up to ~90%. the time-dependent rna unwinding assay was also performed and the results show that ossuv <dig>  unwinds rna duplex substrate in time-dependent manner with maximum activity achieved in one hour  and the unwinding activity did not increase further.figure  <dig>

discussion
in a recent study we have reported that ossuv <dig> protein contains the highest sequence homology to suv <dig> protein from arabidopsis thaliana, as compared to its yeast and human counterparts  <cit> . atsuv <dig> has been reported to be present in the mitochondria  <cit>  therefore most likelyossuv <dig> is also present in mitochondria. in the present study we report the detailed biochemical characterization of ossuv <dig> helicase. the results show that ossuv <dig> exhibits dna and rna-dependent atpase, dna and rna-binding and dna and rna unwinding activities. the results further show that ossuv <dig> is a bipolar helicase capable of unwinding the dna duplex in both the directions. recently, the bipolar dna helicase activity was also reported for pea p <dig>  protein  <cit> . the plant pea dna helicase  <dig>  was also reported as bipolar dna helicase  <cit> . previously it has been reported that the some other non-plant helicases such as pfdh <dig>  pfh <dig> and dbp5/ddx <dig> homologue from human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum exhibit bipolar dna helicase activity  <cit> . some of the bacterial dna helicases  have also been reported as bipolar dna helicases  <cit> . in some of the previous studies it was suggested that hsuv <dig> moves in 5’ to 3’ direction  <cit>  but some other results show that hsuv <dig> moves along the substrate in 3’ to 5’ direction  <cit> .

further characterization reveals that ossuv <dig> shows maximum dna helicase activity only with atp and datp as compared to other ntps/dntps. this characteristic was similar to previously reported pea dna helicase  <dig>   <cit>  and human dna helicase ii  <cit> . the atsuv <dig> was reported to be localized in a. thaliana mitochondria. the characterization of the n-terminal domain of atsuv <dig> containing the characteristic dexh-box helicase motifs revealed that it exhibited a low rna stimulated atpase activity in vitro  <cit> . similar to ossuv <dig> the hsuv3p is also reported to be associated with both the dna and rna helicase activities  <cit> . our results indicate that ossuv <dig> has no dna unwinding activity with blunt end substrate. previous studies have also reported that human and yeast suv <dig> require a single-stranded fragment to unwind and have no detectable activity towards blunt-ended substrates  <cit> . it has been reported previously that hsuv <dig> interacts with the rpa  and fen <dig>  which are recq helicase associated proteins. these observations suggest that even though suv <dig> is considered a mitochondrial helicase but the physical and functional interactions between hsuv <dig> and rpa and fen <dig> support the hypothesis that hsuv <dig> most likely plays an important role in nuclear dna metabolism as well  <cit> . in an interesting recent study it has been reported that hsuv <dig>  polynucleotide phosphorylase and mitochondrial polyadenylation polymerase form a transient complex to modulate mitochondrial mrna polyadenylated tail lengths in response to energetic changes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the biochemical studies reported in this manuscript are the necessary first step to obtain new insights into enzyme function and regulation. overall, this study is the first direct evidence to show the bipolar dna helicase activity of ossuv <dig> protein. this protein exhibits both the atp-dependent dna and rna helicase activities and ssdna/rna-dependent atpase activities which provide energy for its unwinding function. since maintenance of mitochondrial dna requires activity of rna and dna helicases, therefore the dna and rna helicase activity of ossuv <dig> may be useful for mitochondrial rna splicing, translation and genome maintenance. through its rna helicase property it may act as rna chaperone to destabilize the inhibitory secondary structures especially during stress conditions in plants where secondary structures in rna are common. its bipolar dna helicase activity could also be useful in normal functioning of the protein during the stress conditions. overall these results suggest that ossuv <dig> is most likely a multifunctional protein involved in diverse processes including nucleic acid metabolism and might be playing important roles in numerous physiological processes in plant.
