BACKGROUND
a multiple sequence alignment  of proteins contains a set of aligned amino acid sequences in which homologous residues of different sequences are placed in same columns. therefore, functionally or structurally important amino acids and their positions both of which are often strictly conserved are easily detectable with msas
 <cit> . on the other hand, detection of important non-conserved residue positions related to several essential conserved residues requires a more sophisticated approach. the usage of methods such as correlation analysis allow the identification of important non-conserved residue positions based on their correlated mutation manners
 <cit>  due to functional coupling of mutation positions. this coupling might stem from one mutation in a certain site affecting a compensating mutation at another site, even if both related residue sites are distantly positioned in the protein structure. moreover, these coupled mutations can result from spatial, physical, or chemical restrictions or signaling of allostery
 <cit> . thus, determination of these positions is as crucial as the recognition of strictly conserved positions for the understanding of the structural basis of protein functions, and for the identification of functionally important residue regions which might be disease associated, responsible for the maintenance of internal protein volume, or possibly form key sites for interactions within or between proteins
 <cit> .

until now, a variety of studies have employed pearson’s correlation coefficient methods
 <cit> , perturbation based methods
 <cit>  and mutual information  based methods
 <cit>  because of their simplicity and efficiency for the detection of coupled mutations in msas. however, due to background noise, all of these methods interfere with the identification of compensatory mutation signals
 <cit> . hence, the significant compensatory mutation signals must be separated from the background noise that might occur as a result of: i) false signals arising from insufficient data; ii) sites with low or high conservation biasing the signal; iii) phylogenetic noise. while the first two types of noise can be easily overcome by appropriately filtering the data
 <cit> , phylogenetic noise can only be eliminated to some extent by excluding highly similar sequences from the msa
 <cit> .

recently, several methods such as bootstrapping, simulation or randomization methods have been utilized in order to minimize the influence of phylogenetic linkage and stochastic noise
 <cit> . dunn et al.
 <cit>  have introduced the average product correction , to adjust mi for background effects. merkl and zwick, in their study,
 <cit>  have used a normalized mi  and focused on only  <dig> residue pairs with the highest normalized mi values as significant for each msa. gao et al.
 <cit>  have pursued a similar approach, where they have replaced the metric used in
 <cit>  with the amino acid background distribution . while the reduction of background noise in the model of dunn et al. is not quantified, the approaches of gao et al. and merkl and zwick appear to be over-conservative, yet specific.

despite the presence of a variety of different methods as mentioned above, to date there is still need for a method to deal with the noise as well as for powerful metrics to improve the sensitivity. in this study, we have developed such a method called coupled mutation finder . the cmf includes an msa-specific statistical model based on multiple testing procedures described in
 <cit>  and a novel entropy-based metric to upscale dissimilar compensatory mutations and also to complement the normalized mi metric used in
 <cit> . unlike previous normalized mi based studies
 <cit> , we have separated metric-based significant compensatory mutation signals from background noise with respect to our msa specific statistical model that quantifies the error made in terms of the false discovery rate.

to demonstrate the performance and functionality of the cmf, we analyzed the structurally or functionally important positions of two human proteins, namely epidermal growth factor receptor  and glucokinase . the proteins have been chosen because their functionally and structurally important positions have been experimentally well studied previously
 <cit> . as a result, the cmf detects in these two proteins disease associated amino acid mutations ), not strictly conserved catalytic or binding sites, and residues that are nearby one of these sites or in the close neighborhood of a strictly conserved positions, which are likely to affect protein stability or functionality
 <cit> .

RESULTS
our method to predict functionally or structurally important residue positions is composed of two steps. first, we have devised a new msa-specific statistical method for the identification of significant msa column pairs with respect to either of the two metrics
u and
ud. assume that m is the msa under study, these pairs are annotated as
-significant and
,m)-significant, respectively. second, we utilized the connectivity degree of a residue site with respect to a metric introduced in
 <cit> . the connectivity degree of a residue site indicates the number of its significant coupled mutation pairs. in this case, a site is called -significant when the frequency of occurrence of this site in the set of
-significant pairs exceeds the 90-th percentile. having defined the concept of a
,m)-significant site analogously, a site is defined as cmf-significant with respect to m, when it is either
-significant or
,m)-significant.

in this study, we analyzed human egfr  and gck  proteins with a false discovery rate  of 1%. for the preceding one, we defined a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> non-conserved column pairs as significant.  <dig> of these significant pairs are detected as
-significant and  <dig> pairs are observed as
,m)-significant. only  <dig> egfr pairs are significant with respect to both metrics. on the other hand, for gck, we identified a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> non-conserved column pairs as significant where  <dig> of them are
u-significant and  <dig> are
ud-significant. moreover,  <dig> pairs are defined as significant for both
u and
ud-significant.

applying the connectivity degree technique, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> residue positions as
u-significant for human egfr and gck proteins, respectively. additionally,  <dig> positions of egfr and  <dig> positions of gck were detected as
ud-significant. finally, a total of  <dig> sites of egfr and  <dig> of gck were found as cmf-significant, and predicted as of structural or functional importance. however, there have been no residue sites defined as significant with respect to either metric.

essential sites of human egfr and gck proteins
to evaluate the cmf-significant residue sites, we have investigated essential sites of human egfr  and gck  proteins. the essential sites of both proteins have been assigned into three main categories: i) the nssnp positions and their adjacent sites; ii) residue positions which are located at or near active sites, allosteric sites, or binding sites; iii) residue positions which are nearby strictly conserved sites. here, we have used “nearby” definition of nussinov et al.
 <cit>  and defined two residues as in contact or adjacent when the distance between their major carbon atoms is less than  <dig> Å. we have defined positions which are nearby nssnps as essential, because several of them are also adjacent to active sites, allosteric sites, binding sites, or strictly conserved sites. thus, we refer to a cmf-significant residue site as “functionally or structurally important” if it falls into one of these categories of essential sites.

position analysis of the human epidermal growth factor receptor  protein
the epidermal growth factor receptor  is a member of the erbb  family receptors. signaling through this receptor is a highly conserved mechanism from nematode to humans involved in numerous processes, including proliferation, cell fate determination, and tissue specification
 <cit> . furthermore, several studies have implicated that mutations resulting in misregulation of the activity or action of egfr led to multiple cancers, including those of the brain, lung, mammary gland, and ovary
 <cit> . here, in order to detect essential mutation positions in corresponding sequence of human egfr protein, we determined altogether  <dig> cmf-significant residue sites .  <dig> of these significant residue sites have been verified as nssnp sites through the ensembl database annotation and they are illustrated in figure
 <dig> 

additionally, the significant sites e <dig>  q <dig>  and four of the nssnp positions  are also in contact with critical active site regions for gefitinib binding site in the wild type egfr kinase
 <cit>  .

moreover, we observed that  <dig> further cmf-significant positions are essential sites . in total, we have established here for egfr protein the importance of  <dig> out of  <dig> cmf-significant residue sites via different resources
 <cit> .

s: non-synonymous snp site,c: strictly conserved site.

although the vast majority of cmf-significant sites are verified to be structurally or functionally important in human egfr protein, nine cmf-significant sites do not overlap with essential sites. the reason for the high connectivity degree of these unconfirmed significant sites and their role in the egfr protein is unclear.

position analysis of the human glucokinase  protein
glucokinase  is a monomeric enzyme catalyzing phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, which is the first step in the utilization of glucose, at physiological glucose concentration in pancreas and liver. given the fact that gck displays low affinity for glucose, it acts as a glucose sensor playing an important role in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. mutations of the gck gene can lead to maturity onset diabetes of the young  characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and onset early adulthood
 <cit> , or familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia type  <dig> , common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy
 <cit> .

applying our method, we found  <dig> cmf-significant sites to be structurally or functionally important in human gck protein .  <dig> of these significant residue positions are related to disease associated nssnp positions
 <cit>  .

furthermore, nine significant sites are found to be in contact with allosteric sites in the gck protein structure. among these sites, the r <dig> is also allosteric site by itself
 <cit>  and t <dig>  c <dig> and e <dig> overlap with nssnp regions . moreover, the five significant sites t <dig>  f <dig>  t <dig>  q <dig>  and g <dig> interact with glucose binding sites k <dig>  d <dig>  n <dig>  and e290
 <cit>  .

besides this, there are further  <dig> cmf-significant essential sites which are nearby nssnps or strictly conserved residue positions . altogether, we showed the functionality of  <dig> positions out of  <dig> cmf-significant residue sites via different resources
 <cit> .

s: non-synonymous snp site,c: strictly conserved site.

while we are able to establish the large number ofcmf-significant sites as structurally or functionally important in human gck protein, 15cmf-significant sites do not overlap with essential sites. their importance in the gck protein and the reason of high connectivity degree of these unconfirmed significant sites has not been explicitly determined yet.

a comparison between
u-metric and
ud-metric
similarities in physical or biochemical properties of amino acids are likely to be crucial for the detection of functionally or structurally important positions of a protein. in contrast to the
u-metric, which is a normalized mutual information that uses only the frequencies of occurrences of amino acids in the msa columns, the novel
ud-metric includes dissimilarities according to the blosum <dig> matrix when calculating normalized mutual information. as a result the positions which have undergone dissimilar compensatory mutations are upscaled.

having applied the
u-metric as well as the
ud-metric to human egfr and gck proteins, the
ud-metric has shown better sensitivity and specificity. however, only when we use the both metrics together, the sensitivity is significantly increased, whereas the specificity is only moderately decreased. the details are presented in table
 <dig> 

it is important to note that the two metrics complement each other. thus, we propose to use them together.

cmf as a web service
we have implemented a cmf web service  that takes an msa in multiple fasta format and a real number from  interpreted as false discovery rate as input. it reports the results via email.

discussion
to predict sites of structural or functional importance, we combine the known
u-metric of normalized mutual information
 <cit>  with a novel metric
ud to enhance the influence of dissimilar compensatory mutations when measuring covariation of two sites. we discuss how we devised
ud in methods section.

to learn the frequency of compensatory mutations, we took
u-significant site pairs as training data. we did that for reasons of computation time regardless of the fact that these data are biased. to deal with this bias, one could carry through the training in an iterative process, with our training being the first iteration. for i >  <dig>  in the -th iteration of this modified training, a doubly stochastic matrix
dcompmut is calculated based on
ud-significant site pairs. this is done until the training data are stable.

according to birkhoff’s theorem
 <cit> , every doubly stochastic matrix is a convex combination of permutation matrices. moreover, from the hardy-littlewood-pólya majorization theorem
 <cit>  follows that transforming the probability mass function by a doubly stochastic matrix increases entropy. consequently, by linearly transforming the empirical amino acid pair distribution of a site pair by d before calculating the
u-value, we penalized those site pairs whose original distribution does not match the frequency pattern of formal dissimilar compensatory mutations in the training data described in the methods section.

the challenge was to separate the signal caused by structural and functional constraints from the background. to address this issue, we studied only metrics μ that satisfy the following condition. the larger the μ-value, the larger the probability that the two sites k and l have co-evolved. our critical assumptions were: i) the μ-values follow three different distributions, one for the signal, one for the noise, and one for pairs of completely unrelated sites; ii) there is an msa-dependent threshold below which the metric μ does not fall with overwhelming probability, when it is applied to the site pairs of functional or structural importance to which μ is sensitive; iii) there is an msa-dependent threshold significantly smaller then the one in  such that with overwhelming probability there are no μ-values of pairs  of unrelated sites exceeding it.

in order to near-completely eliminate the noise, we filtered both our training and input data. we calculated the significant pairs such that the preassigned false discovery rate was guaranteed by generalizing the storey-tibshirani procedure devised for multiple testing problems
 <cit> .

our method to eliminate noise is orthogonal to the technique developed in
 <cit> . therein, for every pair of sites the so-called average product correction  is calculated as an explicit noise measure, by which the mutual information is then decreased. furthermore, it generalizes the way merkl and zwick
 <cit>  as well as gao et al.
 <cit>  cope with noise. according to our judgment, taking only the top  <dig> high-scoring pairs or the top  <dig> pairs into account as done in
 <cit> , respectively, is too conservative.

we based our noise separation technique on rather weak distribution assumptions that are standard practice in multiple hypothesis testing, instead of explicitly model the noise in terms of a metric. we applied the connectivity degree technique due to merkl and zwick
 <cit>  to significant site pairs with respect to our metrics. the cut-off for the connectivity degree was set to the 90-th percentile. that way we defined significant sites. finally, a site was defined to be cmf-significant, if it was μ-significant, where μ is either
u or
ud.

why did we set the cut-off value for the connectivity degree to the 90-th percentile? going through all possiblen-th percentiles for n =  <dig> ,…, <dig>  the matthews correlation coefficient  of a joint prediction for human egfr and gck proteins is maximal if n =  <dig> 

it is plausible that the number of functionally or structurally important sites does not only depend on the length of the protein. therefore, the 90-th percentile cut-off should be replaced by an msa-dependent threshold in future studies.

our results for human egfr and gck proteins suggest that the large majority of significant compensatory mutation sites found by cmf are in agreement with previous experimental studies regarding the functions and stability of these proteins.  <dig> and  <dig> cmf-significant sites in human egrf and gck proteins, respectively, are verified as disease associated nssnp positions  where most amino acid substitutions in protein sequences damage structural stability of proteins
 <cit> . moreover, we have observed that in both proteins some of cmf-significant nssnp positions are nearby allosteric sites, binding sites or catalytic sites each of which are considered to be functionally important
 <cit>  . disease associated mutations at these nearby positions are likely to affect protein function
 <cit> .

despite the large number of cmf-significant sites demonstrated to be structurally or functionally important for both of the proteins,  <dig> and  <dig> significant sites in human egfr and gck proteins, respectively, are not included in essential sites. however, we hypothesize that most of the novel significant sites may play a critical role in both proteins notwithstanding the absence of previous experimental data. therefore, further progress from the molecular and structural biology end is required not only to assess the importance of these sites, but also for a future perspective on a deeper understanding of protein structure.

because we have also used the
u-metric, we compared our tool with h2r presented in
 <cit>  rather than with those methods developed in
 <cit> . this way, we studied the impact of applying the storey-tibshirani procedure in combination with the effect of using the 90-th percentile cut-off for the connectivity degree. we have applied h2r without adding pseudo counts to the human egfr and gck protein. for egfr, the  <dig> sites t <dig>  a <dig>  n <dig>  a <dig>  q <dig>  v <dig>  n <dig>  v <dig>  k <dig>  v <dig>  m <dig>  k <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig> are identified as significant. out of these significant sites, ten of these residue sites t <dig>  a <dig>  n <dig>  a <dig>  q <dig> k <dig>  v <dig>  m <dig>  k <dig>  and d <dig> are essential sites. on the other hand, for gck, h2r identified the  <dig> residue positions l <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  m <dig>  c <dig>  v <dig>  g <dig>  d <dig>  g <dig>  l <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig>  t <dig>  k <dig>  and h <dig> as significant. twelve of these sites, namely r <dig>  r <dig>  m <dig>  c <dig>  v <dig>  g <dig> d <dig>  g <dig>  l <dig>  d <dig>  k <dig>  and h <dig>  are essential sites. however, when using the h2r web service  to analyze egfr and gck proteins, sensitivity is decreased, while precision is increased. by this service only eight sites for egfr and nine sites for gck were found to be significant. moreover, only five and eight of them are verified as functionally or structurally important for egfr and gck proteins, respectively. this difference stems from the fact that the h2r web service tightens the filtering of the columns. in addition to this, statistically evaluating h2r for egfr and gck proteins, we observed a sensitivity of  <dig> %, specificity of  <dig> %, precision of  <dig> %, and a matthews correlation coefficient value of  <dig> . on the other hand, the cmf reaches precision of  <dig> %, and a matthews correlation coefficiant value of  <dig> . for sensitivity and specificity of the cmf refer to the last row of table
 <dig> 

the results of this comparison show that a vast majority of functionally or structurally important residue positions cannot be detected without using our novel msa specific model and both metrics ) together.

CONCLUSIONS
the cmf is a new method which includes an msa-specific statistical model based on multiple testing procedures that quantifies the error made in terms of the false discovery rate and a novel entropy-based metric to upscale blosum <dig> dissimilar compensatory mutations. hence, it shows how dissimilar compensatory mutations have affected genomic sequences in the course of evolution. the method is able to predict significant compensatory mutation positions in protein sequences. we suggest that cmf could be used as a novel automated function prediction tool that is required for a better understanding of the structural basis of proteins.
