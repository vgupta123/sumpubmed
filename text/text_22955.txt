BACKGROUND
transcription factors play vital roles in almost all plant biological processes  <cit> . among the largest and most diverse dimerizing transcription factor families, the basic leucine zipper  family of proteins in plants participates in regulating various processes including floral induction and development, stress and hormone signaling, photomorphogenesis, seed maturation and germination, and pathogen defense  <cit> .

the bzip proteins characteristically possess a bzip domain composed of a basic region and a leucine zipper  <cit> . the highly conserved basic region consists of approximately  <dig> amino acid residues that contain an invariant n-x7-r/k motif and that are responsible for sequence-specific dna binding  <cit> . the less conserved leucine zipper is composed of a heptad repeat of leu or other bulky hydrophobic amino acids  positioned exactly nine amino acids toward the c-terminus to form an amphipathic helix, which confers homo- or hetero-dimerization specificity  <cit> . plant bzip proteins preferentially bind to dna sequences contain an acgt core, especially like g-box , c-box  and a-box   <cit> .

members of the bzip transcription factor family have been comprehensively identified or predicted in several plant species . in the model plants arabidopsis and rice,  <dig> and  <dig> distinct members of the bzip family have been identified and analyzed, respectively  <cit> . bzip family members of arabidopsis have been classified into ten groups based on a similar basic region and additional conserved motifs outside the bzip domain  <cit> . osbzip proteins are divided into  <dig> groups based on their putative dna-binding specificity and dimerization properties  <cit> .

until now, some bzip transcription factors have been reported to function in the anther development. in arabidopsis, atbzip <dig> overexpression is detrimental to pollen development and atbzip <dig> is thought to be closely related to water movement during anther development, when anthers first absorb water for growth but dehydrate before dehiscence . atbzip <dig> controls pollen wall patterning and several metabolic pathways in developing pollen  <cit> . among the ten members of tgacg  motif-binding proteins composing a distinct subgroup in the bzip family of arabidopsis, tga  <dig> and tga <dig> have been reported to play a role in anther patterning and dehiscence. tga9/ <dig>  together with roxy1/ <dig>  positively regulate a common set of genes that contribute to the development of the tapetal, which provides nutrients and secretes enzymes and structural components of the pollen coat  <cit> . in rice, osabi <dig> is highly expressed in mature pollen and suppression of osabi <dig> expression in transgenic rice lines causes abnormal mature pollen development and low fertility  <cit> . however, among the largest and most diverse transcription factor families, bzip gene family have not been systematically identified from the wheat genome. and, to date, few wheat bzip transcription factors have been identified to be involved in anther development.

the hexaploid bread wheat  derived from two hybridizations in the evolution history between three gramineous ancestors. wheat arose as a result of hybridization between the cultivated tetraploid emmer wheat  and diploid goat grass  approximately  <dig>  years ago. the three sub-genomes of wheat evolved from t.urartu , from a species that might be from the section sitopsis , and from ae.tauschii , respectively  <cit> . wheat is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world  <cit> . recently, an ordered draft sequence of the 17gb hexaploid bread wheat genome has been generated by sequencing isolated chromosome arms and major efforts have been undertaken worldwide to sequence and annotate the wheat genome .

wheat thermosensitive genic male sterile  lines such as bs <dig> are of great importance for the utilization of heterosis in wheat breeding  <cit> . when exposed to low temperature conditions, bs <dig> becomes sterile, thus allowing the large-scale production of f <dig> hybrids via crossing with wheat restorer lines. the male sterility phenotype is heritable in wheat tgms lines and controlled strictly by temperature  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that male fertility in bs <dig> is controlled by temperature during the period from the pollen mother cell  stage to the meiosis stage  <cit> . the two-line cross combinations of bs-series are our exclusive plant materials for wheat breeding and several of them have been widely used in wheat breeding and production. as important parental materials used in two-line combined breeding, bs <dig>  and ty <dig>  generate a fertility-restored f <dig> hybrid. thus, the cross combination of bs <dig>  ty <dig> and their hybrid f <dig> is the excellent candidate for studying anther development in wheat.

in this study, we report the identification of bzip family genes in the current genomes of wheat and its relatives, including triticum urartu, aegilops tauschii and hordeum vulgare. then, we have identified the orthologs and in-paralogs between each pair of wheat and its relatives. further, we have proposed the evolutionary relationship among wheat and its relatives based on the orthology analyses of bzip family. bzip transcription factors in wheat, t.urartu and ae.tauschii have been classified on the basis of phylogenetic analyses.  <dig> anther development related bzip genes are selected from differentially expressed genes by microarray data analyses. their gene structure and cis-acting elements have been also analyzed. expression analyses have been performed to reveal their expression profile in response to low temperature and tissue-specific expression pattern in wheat male sterility line bs <dig>  restorer line ty <dig> and their f <dig> hybrid and an emphasis is laid on expression in anther. our results deepen the understanding of evolutionary relationship of wheat and its relatives and provide a prospective for biological involvement of bzip family genes in anther development and heterosis of wheat.

RESULTS
identification of bzip transcription factors in wheat, t. urartu, ae. tauschii and barley
in the gramineae family, except for t.urartu and ae.tauschii, barley and brachypodium are also close relatives of wheat. the evolutionary relationships between rice, brachypodium, barley and wheat have been speculated based on the mean synonymous substitution rates  of orthologous gene pairs  <cit> . to identify bzip transcription factors in wheat, t. urartu, ae. tauschii, barley and brachypodium, a hidden markov model  search was performed using the hmm profiles of the bzip domain  as queries against the respective protein databases. as a result, the amino acid sequences of  <dig> possible bzip transcription factors were obtained using a perl program from hmm search hits against the t. urartu and ae. tauschii protein databases, respectively. among these sequences, three contig sequences were removed from the analysis. subsequently, two t. urartu proteins and one ae. tauschii protein were discarded because they lacked the typical bzip domain, finally resulting in the identification of 98 t. urartu and  <dig> ae. tauschii bzip transcription factors. similarly,  <dig> non-redundant bzip proteins were identified in the wheat genome and named. all these wheat bzip genes were designated as tabzip genes and given a number designation from  <dig> to  <dig> as an unique identifier as proposed for bzip transcription factors in arabidopsis  <cit> . the nomenclature was based on the positions of these genes on the wheat chromosomes, from the short arm to the long arm and in the order of 1a to 7a, 1b to 7b and 1d to 7d. additionally, several tabzip genes had been identified in previous studies . taabf <dig>  <cit>  and tabzip <dig>  <cit>  were identical to tabzip <dig> and tabzip <dig> in our  <dig> wheat bzip family members, respectively. wlip19a, wlip19b and wlip19d   <cit>  were identical to tabzip <dig>  tabzip <dig> and tabzip <dig>  respectively. taobf1b and taobf1d  <cit>  were identical to tabzip <dig> and tabzip <dig>  however, taobf1a  <cit> , wabi <dig>  <cit> , taabp <dig>  <cit> , taabi <dig>  <cit>  and taabl <dig>  <cit>  was not within  <dig> bzip family members identified by us. finally, these  <dig> tabzip genes were added to wheat bzip gene family. so a total of  <dig> wheat bzip genes were identified from the current wheat genome. similarly, the 98 t. urartu and  <dig> ae. tauschii bzip genes were designated as tubzip1- <dig> and aetbzip1- <dig>  respectively. furthermore,  <dig> bzip proteins were also seperated from the barley genome. the brachypodium genome had been repoted to contain  <dig> bzip genes  <cit> . the nomenclature and chromosomal location of all bzip genes are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

orthology and in-paralogy of t. urartu and ae. tauschii bzip proteins
orthologous genes in different species originate from a single gene in the last common ancestor of these species and are therefore likely to share the same function  <cit> . homologs deriving from gene duplications are called paralogs. because gene duplication events take place both before and after speciation, paralogy can also exist between genes in different species. paralogs that originate following a gene duplication after speciation are termed as “in-paralogs”  <cit> .

t. urartu and ae. tauschii are the progenitors of the a and d genomes of hexaploid wheat , respectively. a preliminary analyses have revealed that t. urartu and ae. tauschii are evolutionarily close. to gain a better understanding of the evolutionary relationship of bzip genes, inparanoid  <dig>  was used to identify orthologs and in-paralogs between t. urartu and ae. tauschii . among the bzip proteins from t. urartu and ae. tauschii,  <dig> groups of orthologs that were composed of  <dig>  t. urartu and  <dig>  ae. tauschii proteins were detected using inparanoid  <dig> . the largest group of orthologs contained 4 t. urartu proteins and  <dig> ae. tauschii proteins and showed a many-to-many type of orthology. in this case, tubzip <dig>  tubzip <dig>  tubzip <dig> and tubzip <dig>  as in-paralogs from the same cluster, were co-orthologous to aetbzip <dig> and aetbzip <dig>  according to the clustering algorithm  <cit> , tubzip <dig>  tubzip <dig> and tubzip <dig> originated from the gene duplication of tubzip <dig>  while aetbzip <dig> was derived from aetbzip <dig>  the remaining groups of orthologs between t. urartu and ae. tauschii represented straightforward one-to-one orthology. results showed that there were few in-paralogs in whether t. urartu or ae. tauschii for bzip gene family. furthermore, bzip family members in t. urartu shared high similarity in protein sequence with those in ae. tauschii, indicating gene functions of bzip family might remain conserved between t. urartu and ae. tauschii, which was consistent with the study by li  <cit> .fig.  <dig> orthologs between t.urartu and ae.tauschii and in-paralogs within each organism of them. each chromosome of t.urartu and ae.tauschii was figured by actual proportion to others. the chromosomal scales of t.urartu was different from ae.tauschii. the top and bottom of each stick standing for one chromosome were starting point and terminal point of the chromosome, respectively. the deletion bin maps of t. urartu 1a–7a chromosomes were noted on the left side, and bzip genes in each deletion bin were averagely distributed. ‘ua’ and ‘ud’ mean genome regions not located to specific chromosomes, and genes in these regions were averagely distributed, thus the positions in the figure do not stand for the real locations in the genome



evolutionary relationship of wheat, t. urartu, ae. tauschii, barley and brachypodium
to further explore the evolutionary relationship of bzip family genes among these five evolutionarily close species, we identified orthologs and in-paralogs between each pair of these five species  using inparanoid  <dig>  which allowed us to define the evolutionary point of the orthology precisely. to provide a simple explanation, the basic principle was that the number of orthologous groups between closely related species was expected to be greater than that between distantly related species  <cit> . the number of orthologs in each organism clustered with one other genome was summarized in table  <dig>  notably, the table was not a symmetrical table because the gene duplication frequency in organism a generally differed from that in organism b since the speciation of organism a and b. based on table  <dig>  wheat had a high average ortholog group size of  <dig>  such that every tabzip gene had an average of  <dig>  paralogs. the average ortholog group size in t. urartu, ae. tauschii, barley and brachypodium were found to be significantly smaller than that in wheat, which was consistent with the observation that these four genomes all had relatively fewer in-paralogs compared to the wheat genome . additional file 1: table s <dig> also showed the intuitive observation that wheat had many more in-paralogs of bzip genes than the other genomes.fig.  <dig> orthologs between t. urartu , ae. tauschii , b. distachyon  and h. vulgare . “1a”-“7a”, “1d”-“7d”, “1 bd”-“5 bd” and “1h”-“7h” represented chromosomes of t. urartu, ae. tauschii, b. distachyon and h. vulgare,respectively. the chromosomes for the same species were drawn to scale based on actual proportion, but chromosomes of different species were figured by different scales. the direction for each chromosome from starting point to terminal point was indicated by the red arrow. ‘ua’, ‘ud’ and ‘uhv’ mean genome regions not located to specific chromosomes, and genes in these regions were averagely distributed, thus the positions in the figure do not stand for the real locations in the genome. the light-grey dashed rectangles in each corner just mean linkers between species. ortholog pairs for the same pairs of species were linked by straight lines of the same color as indicated by the colored block at the bottom. for example, each pair of orthologs between t. urantu and barley were linked with a green straight line

the number of orthologs in an organism  when clustered with another genome  was shown on the left of the slash while the number on the right of the slash referred to the number of ortholog groups between two species. thus,  <dig> wheat genes had orthologs in t.urartu, which were orthologous to a total of 52 t.urartu genes and wheat and t.urartu had totally  <dig> ortholog groups. ‘bzip genes’ referred to the total number of bzip genes in one organism. only one protein for each bzip gene in five genomes was used in in-paranoid clustering. ‘average size of ortholog groups’ referred to the average number of in-paralogs in one ortholog group for an organism. for wheat, average size of ortholog group:  <dig>  = / <dig>  notably, table  <dig> was not a symmetrical table, since gene duplication frequency in organism ‘a’ generally differed from that in organism ‘b’ since speciation of organism ‘a’ and ‘b’ and thus the number of ‘a’ genes having orthologs in organism ‘b’ was unequal to the number of ‘b’ genes having orthologs in organism ‘a’.



to reflect the level of orthology of the bzip family genes between these five species, we constructed a phylogenetic tree termed an orthophylogram  <cit> . the orthology distance from species a to b  was calculated using the following formula  <cit> , and the average orthology distance / <dig> was then used to generate a upgma tree  <cit> , as shown in fig.  <dig>  dab=proteins_a−proteins_a_orthologous_to_bproteins_a fig.  <dig> orthophylogram of wheat and its four close relatives. this upgma tree was based on the average orthology distance between species



this orthophylogram demonstrated quantitatively the level of orthology of the bzip gene family between different species. it was observed from the orthophylogram that wheat had a closer phylogenetic relationship with barley and brachypodium than t. uratu and ae. tauschii.

in plants, the structure and function of most of the bzip genes most likely remained conserved during angiosperm evolution  <cit> , thus, the results of our study provided deeper insight into the possible evolutionary relationship of five close relatives, namely, wheat, t. urartu, ae. tauschii, barley and b. distachyon.

phylogenetic analysis of bzip genes
the phylogenetic analysis was performed with all identified tabzip, tubzip and aetbzip proteins as well as  <dig> arabidopsis and  <dig> rice bzip family members . the tabzip, tubzip and aetbzip proteins were classified primarily into  <dig> subgroups, which were named a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i and s according to a previously described classification method used for arabidopsis bzip family  <cit> . with the newly identified bzip sequences, we found that subgroups s and i could be further divided into s <dig> and s <dig> and into i <dig> and i <dig>  respectively. u1–u <dig> represented four previously unnamed clades, including atbzip <dig> and atbzip <dig>  which did not fit into any of the  <dig> known subgroups  <cit> . another ungrouped arabidopsis bzip member, atbzip <dig>  was incorporated into the i subgroup based on our phylogenetic tree. the newly added arabidopsis bzip family members at1g <dig> and at4g <dig> were found to belong to the e subgroup based on the similar distribution of conserved motifs in the protein sequences with other e subgroup members. similarly, the new member at2g <dig> was found to belong to the i subgroup.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship among tabzip, tubzip, aetbzip, atbzip and osbzip proteins. the phylogenetic tree was based on the sequence alignment of the bzip proteins. the unrooted tree was generated using clustalx  <dig>  program and displayed by mega  <dig> . tabzip, tubzip and aetbzip proteins were mainly classified into  <dig> subgroups  and  <dig> clades based on our phylogenetic analysis and jakoby’s classification method of arabidopsis bzip family. with the newly identified bzip members, s subgroup were divided into two clades s <dig> and s <dig> by the members in c subgroup and the e subgroup seprated protein members in the i subgroup into two clades i <dig> and i <dig>  u1-u <dig> were  <dig> unnamed clades for lack of grouped atbzips



the distribution of bzip proteins in the subgroups differed among the five species , suggesting that different plant species underwent different expansions of the bzip family. the number of bzip proteins in t. urartu was found to be exactly equal to that in ae. tauschii for subgroups a, b, c, d, g, h, i, u <dig> and u <dig> and differed by one for subgroups f and u <dig> . furthermore, the ratio of total identified bzip proteins in wheat to that in t. urartu  was  <dig>  . for subgroups d, g, i and u <dig>  the ratio of total identified bzip proteins in wheat to that in t. urartu  was approximately  <dig>  thus, we estimate that approximately  <dig> bzip proteins in wheat are not represented in the current draft genome.

microarray analyses and identification of anther development-related tabzip genes
to identify tabzip genes related to anther development, we performed microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed tabzip genes during the developmental period from the pmc stage to the meiosis stage of wheat anther. the microarray data included five groups of comparisons, namely, between 366a and 411a , 366e and 411e , 366ab and 366ef , 366a and 366e , and 366b and 366 f . “366” and “411” referred to wheat varieties bs <dig>  and jing <dig> , respectively. the letters “a”, “b”, “e” and “f” represented the growth conditions of bs <dig> and jing <dig> . “a” and “b” were male-sterile conditions while “e” and “f” were male-fertile conditions for bs <dig>  for example, in comparisons groups 366a-411a , the comparison was established between bs <dig> and jing <dig> grown under the same conditions of “a” and jing <dig> was regarded as control.

from the variety comparison between bs <dig> and jing <dig> grown under 10°c with a 12 h/12 h photoperiod ,  <dig> tabzip genes were identified as differentially expressed genes , including  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes . the 366e-411e group identified  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated tabzip genes . in the 366ab-366ef group,  <dig> upregulated tabzip genes were identified, but no downregulated genes were detected . in addition, only one upregulated tabzip gene was identified from the comparison of bs <dig>  and bs <dig> .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes in three comparison groups. a 366a-411a,  366e-411e and  366ab-366ef. differentially expressed genes were defined based on p-values and adjusted p-values . "366" and "411" represented wheat varieties "bs366" and "jing411". the letters "a", "b", "e" and "f" referred to the grown conditions . the numbers " <dig> ", " <dig> ", " <dig> ", " <dig> " and " <dig> " represented the lengths of anthers when sampling



altogether, among all tabzip genes represented on the microarray,  <dig> tabzip genes were differentially expressed . it had been reported that  <dig> bzip genes from arabidopsis, rice and maize had an important role in floral development . these  <dig> genes included atbzip <dig>   <cit> , atbzip <dig>   <cit> , atbzip <dig>   <cit> , atbzip <dig>  <cit> , atbzip <dig>   <cit> , atbzip <dig>   <cit> , osabi <dig>  <cit>  and maize dlf <dig>  <cit> . so  <dig> candidate bzip gene were further selected from  <dig> differentially expressed gene based on their phylogenetic relationship and conserved motifs similarity with the  <dig> known floral development-related bzip genes. the phylogenetic relationship and conserved motifs of  <dig> tabzip genes and  <dig> known floral development-related bzip genes were shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> and s <dig> table  <dig> basic information of  <dig> differentially expressed tabzip genes

analysis of gene structures and cis-acting regulatory elements
first, we mapped the exon/intron organization of the  <dig> tabzip genes . we found that  <dig> genes were intronless and that the numbers of introns for the other tabzip genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  based on the method described above, we have identified several pairs of in-paralogs within these  <dig> tabzip genes . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the in-paralogs tended to share an identical or similar exon-intron composition. three in-paralog pairs  had preserved identical gene structure organizations, while another in-paralog pair  had a highly constant exon-intron composition except for differing by six nucleotides within the first exon. gene structure analysis revealed that genes with a close evolutionary relationship tended to share similar gene structures. divergent exon lengths within the coding sequences of several tabzip genes could potentially lead to the generation of functionally distinct paralogs.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis  and exon-intron structures  of  <dig> tabzip genes.  the phylogenetic analysis was performed using the protein sequences of  <dig> tabzip genes. the unrooted phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method and displayed using mega  <dig>  software. numbers above or below branches of the tree indicated bootstrap values.  only the exons, represented by green boxes, were drawn to scale. black lines connecting two exons represented introns. numbers above the exons of each gene structure represented the size of exons. the phylogenetic tree was separated into four subdivisions , ,  and  based on the similarity of gene structures



in addition, we analyzed the cis-acting elements in the promoter sequences of the selected tabzip genes . promoter sequences were available for  <dig> among  <dig> selected tabzip genes. and according to prediction of cis-acting elements,  <dig> of these  <dig> tabzip genes  contained ltr elements in their promoter regions, which was consistent with their expression patterns in response to low temperature . expression patterns under low temperature showed that  <dig> of these  <dig> tabzip genes  were responsive to low temperature to varying degrees . among them, tabzip <dig> was predicted to have the most ltr elements in its promoter region, and expression analysis demonstrated that tabzip <dig> exhibited the most remarkable change in expression level after treatment because the highest expression value was over  <dig> times higher than the lowest value .fig.  <dig> expression levels of tabzip genes in anther of wheat line bs <dig> following low temperature treatment. the 2−ΔΔc
t method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of the target genes. the expression of each tabzip gene at 0 h was regarded as a reference, and other values represented the expression levels relative to the reference. mean values and sds were obtained from three biological replicates.   <dig> tabzip genes ;   <dig> tabzip genes 



expression patterns of tabzip genes in response to low temperature treatment
first,  <dig> genes were selected from differentially expressed genes based on microarray analyses, indicating these  <dig> genes were more likely to be involved in anther development. additionally, the male fertility of bs <dig> was controlled by temperature. exposing to  <dig> °c for 5d  leaded to complete male sterility in bs <dig>  <cit> . thus, we speculate that expression of genes involved in male fertility of bs <dig> is supposed to be affected by low temperature.

to investigate the expression patterns of tabzip genes in response to low temperature  treatment, quantitative real-time pcr  was performed using bs <dig> anthers that were collected at different time points from the pmc to the meiosis stage as samples. results showed that the expressions of  <dig> among the  <dig> tabzip genes were obviously responsive to low temperature and these genes exhibited complicated expression changes after different durations of treatment .

clear changes in expression values were observed for these  <dig> tabzip genes post-treatment. the transcript levels of six of the  <dig> tabzip genes were upregulated at each time point after treatment compared with the untreated control. tabzip <dig> exhibited the most remarkable change in expression after treatment because the highest expression value was over  <dig> times higher than the lowest value. tabzip <dig> and tabzip <dig> shared a similar changing tendency that transcripts increased gradually and reached a maximum at 12 h, then declined to a relatively lower level at 24 h, followed by an increase throughout the following durations.

tissue-specific expression patterns of tabzip genes in the male-sterile line, restorer line and their f <dig> hybrid
among ty <dig>  bs <dig> and f <dig>  grown under local environmental conditions of fuyang , no differences in the morphology or structure of the stamens and pistils were observed before blooming . however, after blooming, the anthers of bs <dig> failed to dehisce as those of ty <dig> and f <dig>  and a few pollen grains formed and were devoid of starch . the results of pollen iodine staining demonstrated that the pollen grains of bs <dig> were small, irregularly shaped, nearly transparent and easily broken compared with those of ty <dig> and f <dig>  statistical analysis showed that  <dig>  % of the pollen grains in ty <dig> and  <dig>  % in f <dig> were circular, opaque and dark brown-black after iodine staining, while bs <dig> exhibited a highly male-sterile type because no type a pollen grains were present and because  <dig>  % of the pollen grains that were present were circular, opaque or partially transparent and light brown-black after iodine staining .

to explore tissue-specific and variety-specific expression pattern of the  <dig> tabzip genes in the wheat cross combination ty806 × bs <dig>  we obtained samples from the roots, stems, leaves and anthers of ty <dig>  bs <dig> and their hybrid f <dig> at the meiosis stage to analyze their expression patterns. the results revealed that every tabzip gene exhibited a distinct tissue-specific expression pattern in ty <dig>  bs <dig> and their hybrid f <dig> at the meiosis stage . additionally, as in-paralogs, both the tabzip2/tabzip <dig> and tabzip26/tabzip <dig> pairs exhibited similar tissue expression patterns, while tabzip <dig> showed a different expression profile compared to its in-paralog tabzip <dig>  furthermore, tabzip <dig> and tabzip <dig> were both expressed at low levels in anther tissue .fig.  <dig> tissue-specific expression pattern of  <dig> tabzip genes in bs <dig>  ty <dig> and their hybrid f <dig>  bs <dig> is the male-sterile line and ty <dig> is the restorer line. the 2−ΔΔc
t method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of the target genes. the expression of each tabzip gene at 0 h was regarded as a reference, and other values represented the expression levels relative to the reference. mean values and sds were obtained from three biological replicates



among the  <dig> tabzip genes,  <dig> were predominantly expressed in the anther, which indicated that they were more likely to have a role in anther development during meiosis.

furthermore, we selected the anther expression data of these  <dig> tabzip genes to analyze the expression differences among the three wheat lines . significant differences between the f <dig> and ty <dig> or between the f <dig> and bs <dig> were assessed using a t-test. these  <dig> tabzip genes, excluding tabzip <dig>  were further classified into three distinct gene expression modes based on their deviation from the mid-parent prediction: over-dominance, under-dominance and low-parent dominance  <cit> . the high-parent dominant genes and low-parent dominant genes were defined according to the following criterion that the expression level in f <dig> genotype was significantly different from that in one parent and no significantly different from that in another parent. and the genes were identified as over-dominance or under-dominance when the expression level in f <dig> genotype was significantly higher or lower than those in both inbred parents  <cit> . tabzip <dig> displayed such extremely clear over-dominance that the expression level in the f <dig> was approximately 6-fold greater than that in bs <dig>  while the corresponding multiple for tabzip <dig> was approximately 4-fold. among the genes with over-dominance mode, tabzip <dig>  tabzip <dig>  tabzip <dig>  tabzip <dig> and tabzip <dig> showed similar expression trend because they were expressed maximally in the f <dig> and had the lowest expression level in ty <dig>  tabzip <dig> showed an under-dominance mode because the slight expression in the f <dig> was significantly lower than those in ty <dig> and bs <dig>  tabzip <dig> was expressed primarily in ty <dig> and exhibited slight expression in both bs <dig> and f <dig>  which belonged to the low-parent dominance mode. in conclusion, the tabzip genes showed multiple gene expression modes in ty <dig>  bs <dig> and their f <dig> hybrid, and these results were consistent with relevant studies in maize and rice that supported the theory that multiple modes of gene action collaboratively contributed to heterosis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> differential expression of  <dig> tabzip genes in anther of ty <dig>  bs <dig> and their hybrid f <dig>  these  <dig> tabzip genes were predominantly expressed in anther. the expression of each gene in anther of ty <dig> was regarded as a reference, and other values represented the expression levels of this gene in anther of bs <dig> and f <dig> relative to the reference. single asterisk indicated the expression difference between ty <dig> and f <dig> or between bs <dig> and f <dig> was significant at p <  <dig>  by the t-test and double asterisks meant a highly significant difference between ty <dig> and f <dig> or between bs <dig> and f <dig>  these  <dig> tabzip genes were sorted into three distinct gene expression modes based on their deviation from the mid-parent prediction: over-dominance, under-dominance and low-parent dominance. tabzip <dig> did not belong to any of four kinds of modes

discussion
evolutionary relationship of wheat, t. urartu, ae. tauschii, barley and brachypodium
the evolutionary relationships between rice, brachypodium, barley and wheat have been speculated based on the mean synonymous substitution rates  of orthologous gene pairs  <cit> . wheat shared a common ancestor with rice approximately 40– <dig> million years bc, and the divergence time of brachypodium from other gramineous plants was approximately 32– <dig> million years bc. subsequently, barley diverged from other gramineous plants approximately 3– <dig> million years bc  <cit> .

wheat derived from hybridization between the cultivated tetraploid emmer wheat  and diploid goat grass  approximately  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the three diploid progenitor genomes of wheat, aa from t. urartu, bb from a species that might be from the section sitopsis, and dd from ae. tauschii, originated from a common triticeae ancestor approximately  <dig> - <dig>  million years ago  <cit> .

notably, t. urartu, ae. tauschii and barley, all of which were diploid, shared the same chromosome number , suggesting that they had a relatively close evolutionary relationship. furthermore, synteny block identification among brachypodium, barley and ae. tauschii revealed that they were most likely to share a common ancestral set of five chromosomes  <cit> . the draft genome sequence of ae. tauschii revealed  <dig>  orthologous gene pairs between barley and ae. tauschii and  <dig>  between brachypodium and ae. tauschii  <cit> . although the t. urartu genome was more than  <dig> times larger than that of b. distachyon, the average gene sizes of these two organisms were similar, and the predicted gene number  in the t. urartu genome was only approximately  <dig> -fold that of b. distachyon   <cit> . in conclusion, previous studies have demonstrated that wheat, t. urartu, ae. tauschii, barley and brachypodium are evolutionarily close in the gramineae family. however, the real evolutionary relationship among them still remains mysterious.

bzip family genes appeared before the divergence between monocots and dicots and the structure and function of most bzip genes most likely remained conserved during angiosperm evolution  <cit> . bzip transcription factors were associated with the evolution of plants  <cit> . thus, in this study, we deduced the possible evolutionary relationship among them based on orthology analyses of bzip transcription factors. in the case of the bzip family, a sub-genome of wheat was more similar with t.urartu than other three genomes . similarly, among t.urartu, ae.tauschii, barley and brachypodium, d sub-genome of wheat was most similar with ae.tauschii . however, b sub-genome of wheat was more similar with barley  and brachypodium  than t.urartu  and ae.tauschii  . in addition, it was observed from fig.  <dig> that wheat had a closer evolutionary relationship with barley and brachypodium than t. urartu and ae. tauschii. approximately  <dig>  years ago, wheat arose as a result of hybridization between the cultivated tetraploid emmer wheat  and diploid goat grass   <cit> . it could be deduced that much more than approximately  <dig>  years ago, t. dicoccoides  was generated from the hybridization between t. urartu  and the donor of b sub-genome. so t. urartu and ae. tauschii were very old species. from speciation, wheat had undergone at least  <dig>  years of evolution course. and after long-term natural selection and artificial domestication and cultivation, a and d sub-genomes of modern wheat were no more what they had been. if the self-evolution of t. urartu and ae .tauschii was taken into consideration, there might exist bigger differences between a sub-genome  of modern wheat and modern t. urartu . however, it was a generally acknowledged fact that barley was one of close relatives of wheat, and brachypodium had been regarded as a suitable model system for studies on temperate cereals, such as wheat, because of its small and similar genome  <cit> . so it was understandable that wheat had a closer phylogenetic relationship with barley and brachypodium than t. uratu and ae. tauschii that was concluded from orthology analyses. our results provided deeper insight into evolutionary relationship of wheat and its relatives.

the evolution of bzip transcription factor family
the phylogenetic analysis of bzip transcription factors in rice and arabidopsis indicated that these genes appeared preceding the divergence between monocots and dicots  <cit> . in plants, the structure and function of most bzip genes most likely maintained conserved during angiosperm evolution  <cit> . indeed, the majority of osbzip proteins were found to be orthologous to atbzip proteins  <cit> . according to the orthologs identified in wheat and its four relatives , barley had  <dig> groups of orthologs with brachypodium and  <dig> groups of orthologs with wheat. notably,  <dig>  % of the tubzip proteins were orthologous to  <dig>  % of the aetbzip proteins .

during evolution process of bzip transcription factor family, several new subgroups or clades had come into being in the t. urartu and ae. tauschii genomes. based on the phylogenetic tree , subgroups a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, and s, as well as u <dig> and u <dig>  clearly consisted of bzip proteins that were present in all five species, indicating that the origin of all  <dig> subgroups and u <dig> and u <dig> might have predated the speciation events between eudicot and monocot plants. in contrast, u <dig> and u <dig> consisted of only bzip proteins from t. urartu and ae. tauschii but not from wheat, arabidopsis or rice. previous studies had deduced that wheat and rice share a common ancestor approximately  <dig> to  <dig> million years bc  <cit> . the observation that u <dig> and u <dig> bzip proteins were only present in the t. urartu and ae. tauschii genomes suggests that these genes likely arose after the evolutionary divergence of rice from other gramineous plants; however, these genes disappeared during the evolution or domestication of wheat, which was consistent with the observation that wheat underwent genetic loss as a consequence of domestication  <cit> .

additionally, bzip family went through different degrees of expansion in different gramineous plants. from table  <dig>  it could be deduced that wheat had many more in-paralogs than its four relatives t. urartu, ae. tauschii, barley and brachypodium. on average, each tabzip gene had  <dig>  in-paralogs. two explanations likely accounted for this high average:  wheat was derived from two hybridizations between three diploid progenitors, and as a consequence, several copies of homologous genes had been gathered together in the wheat genome;  a vast number of repetitive genes were present in the wheat genome as a result of gene duplication. by contrast, both t. urartu and ae. tauschii had few in-paralogs in the case of the bzip family , indicating that gene duplication events were likely to occur very rarely within both t. urartu and ae. tauschii, or that the gene duplication frequency was low during the long evolutionary history of at least  <dig>  years because gene duplication can accelerate the generation of in-paralogs within a species  <cit> . few gene duplication events might limit the expansion of a gene family such as the bzip transcription factor family, which might account for the similar sums of bzip family members between t. urartu and ae. tauschii.

function of bzip family genes in anther development
previous studies have demonstrated that bzip transcription factors participate in anther development . in our study, we have identified 48differentially expressed bzip genes from anther tissue . among them, tabzip <dig> and tabzip <dig> were identified as differentially expressed bzip genes from the comparison between bs <dig> grown under  <dig> °c  and bs <dig> grown under  <dig> °c . tabzip <dig>  was isolated previously from pooled seedlings 8– <dig> days after germination and florets from pre-meiosis to immediately before anthesis  <cit> . in addition, tabzip <dig> shared high sequence similarity with the mrna sequence  isolated from anthers and pre-anthesis spikes of fertile and sterile plants  <cit> . tabzip <dig>  had high similarity with ta_contig <dig>  and ta_contig <dig> , which were also isolated from anthers and pre-anthesis spikes of fertile and sterile plants  <cit> . these results suggested that tabzip <dig> and tabzip <dig> were possibly related to anther development.

additionally, sequence analysis revealed that tabzip <dig> and tabzip <dig> were highly similar to arabidopsis tga <dig> and tga <dig> in the protein sequence, which played a role in anther patterning and dehiscence  <cit> . and expression analysis showed that tabzip <dig> is predominantly expressed in anther . therefore, tabzip <dig> might share similar function with tga <dig> and tga <dig>  besides, tabzip <dig>  which was also predominantly expressed in anther , had complete sequence and domain identities with osabi <dig> of  <dig>  % and 93 %, respectively. osabi <dig> was required for pollen development and to maintain normal fertility in rice  <cit> .

expression in anther demonstrated that tabzip genes exhibited multiple gene expression modes in the ty806 × bs <dig> heterotic cross . there were mainly three possibilities accounting for the differential transcription of the same gene in ty806 × bs366:  the interplay between promoter indel and regulated expression of trans-acting factors ;  microrna regulation;  dna methylation. previous study have revealed that sequence polymorphism within promoter alleles between inbreds preferentially occurs in those differentially transcribed genes. promoter indels and differential expression of transcription factors may result in all possible modes of gene action  <cit> . mirnas generally act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in plants . dna methylation significantly contributes to gene expression pattern and the promoter-methylated genes tend to show a greater degree of tissue-specific expression  <cit> .

compared with ty <dig> and f <dig>  the most special fertility-related characters of bs <dig> under specific low temperature conditions were that the anthers fail to dehisce normally and that few pollen grains were produced and devoid of starch. as shown in fig.  <dig>  tabzip <dig> was expressed predominantly in anthers of bs <dig> relative to those of ty <dig> and their f <dig> hybrid under low temperature conditions . furthermore, tabzip <dig> was highly homologous to atbzip <dig>  which was involved in the control of several metabolic pathways of developing pollen in arabidopsis, including pollen wall patterning  <cit> . thus, tabzip <dig> was probably involved in anther development, however, whether tabzip <dig> had a correlation with the character of male sterility in bs <dig> required further functional verification.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig> bzip family genes were comprehensively identified from the current wheat genome.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members of bzip family were also identified from the genomes of t.urartu, ae.tauschii and barley, respectively. the orthologs and in-paralogs between each pair of wheat and its relatives had been also identified. results showed t.urartu and ae.tauschii were evolutionarily close and wheat probably had a closer phylogenetic relationship with barley and brachypodium than t.urartu and ae.tauschii. based on microarray data,  <dig> differentially expressed tabzip genes were identified to be related to anther development from the comparison between the male-sterile line and the male-fertile line. genes with close evolutionary relationship tended to share similar gene structures. expression of  <dig> among  <dig> selected tabzip genes were obviously responsive to low temperature. these  <dig> tabzip genes all exhibited distinct tissue-specific expression pattern. among them,  <dig> tabzip genes were predominantly expressed in anther and most of them showed over-dominance expression mode in the cross combination ty806 × bs <dig>  this study provided a comprehensive overview of the bzip family in wheat and its relatives and laid a foundation for further evolution research and functional characterization of anther development related tabzip gene.
