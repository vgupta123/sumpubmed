BACKGROUND
histone wrapping of nuclear dna generates nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin in virtually all eukaryotes. nucleosomes are dynamically associated with the genome and their distribution is not random, but often plays a major role in regulating gene expression  <cit> . nucleosome assembly is favored or deterred by differences in the enthalpic and entropic costs inherent in wrapping and maintaining different sequences in the rigid nucleosome toroid, and this has resulted in a eukaryotic nucleosome positioning code  <cit> . histones, and presumably histone-dna interactions, evolved before the divergence of the archaeal and eukaryotic lineages with histones now distributed throughout the euryarchaea, nanoarchaea and thaumarchaea and also present in some crenarchaea <cit> .

sequencing dna molecules selected from a large random population by repetitive selection  and pcr-amplification, based on increased archaeal histone-dna affinity, revealed that dna molecules preferentially assembled into archaeal nucleosomes in vitro had sequences that conformed to the eukaryotic nucleosome positioning code  <cit> . however, the technology was not then available to determine if this was also the case in vivo and so confirm in vivo these results obtained in vitro. but, with the advent of large-scale dna sequencing technologies, such comparisons became possible, and here we document that archaeal nucleosome assembly in vivo is directed by the nucleosome positioning code in both methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus and thermococcus kodakarensis, and that this is reproduced in vitro with archaeal genomic dna and purified archaeal or eukaryotic histones. with recently developed genetic technologies, it was possible to delete either, but not both of the two archaeal histone-encoding genes present in t. kodakarensis generating strains that grow normally but exhibit transcriptome changes when compared with the parental strain  <cit> . here we show that the histone deletions also result in changes in the archaeal nucleosome profiles upstream of the genes that have increased or decreased transcription.

RESULTS
nucleosome positioning motifs in vivo
the discovery of archaeal histones  <cit>  and most subsequent studies  <cit> , have investigated histones from methanogens for which genetic procedures are not available. we therefore first determined, and confirmed, that archaeal nucleosome positioning in vivo was directed by same sequence motifs in m. thermautotrophicus and t. kodakarensis and then focused on t. kodakarensis, as the experimental system, for which genetic procedures and strains with histone genes deleted were available  <cit> . as previously documented for m. thermautotrophicus <cit> , mn digestion of chromatin from t. kodakarensis generated a ladder of discrete-length dna molecules, with a predominant population of ~90 bp molecule first accumulating, consistent with the length of a dna molecule required to completely encircle an archaeal histone tetramer core  <cit> . with further mn digestion, the number of ~90 bp molecules decreased and ~60 bp molecules accumulated , the length of dna directly bound by the histone folds of a histone tetramer. deep-sequencing of the ~60 bp fragments resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> million unique reads, respectively, of molecules with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides from m. thermautotrophicus and t. kodakarensis . as established for dna molecules preferentially packaged into eukaryotic nucleosomes  <cit> , these sequences were dominated by helical repeats  of aa/at/ta/tt dinucleotides offset by 5 bp from repeats of gg/gc/cg/cc dinucleotides with the centers preferentially filled by gc-rich sequences .

in contrast to a/t-rich dinucleotides that, in a 10 bp periodicity, offer flexibility and so facilitate dna incorporation, poly  tracts are relatively rigid. this deters their incorporation into nucleosomes  <cit>  and poly  tracts are significantly underrepresented in dna incorporated into eukaryotic nucleosomes  <cit> . analyses of the archaeal ~60 bp nucleosomal dna fragments revealed that a/t-rich oligonucleotides were also excluded from incorporation into archaeal nucleosomes assembled in m. thermautotrophicus and t. kodakarensis. for example, as illustrated in figures 2c and 2d, when the frequencies of occurrence of each of the  <dig> pentamers was determined, all of the  <dig> pentamers that contain only a and/or t were underrepresented relative to the presence in the genome sequences with atata  being the most disfavored pentamer in both archaea. oligo a/t-rich sequences are consequently located preferentially in nucleosome-depleted regions. in contrast, all of the  <dig> pentamers that contain only g and/or c were enriched in the ~60 bp mn-protected fragments generated from both archaea relative to their abundances in the genome sequences .

exclusion of nucleosomes from intergenic regions
in t. kodakarensis, at least 92% of the genome is coding sequence  <cit> , and most intergenic regions are <100 bp, with many <50 bp. within these regions, both transcription initiation  and termination  are directed by a/t-rich sequences  <cit> . given compliance with the nucleosome positioning code  <cit> , archaeal nucleosome assembly should avoid intergenic regions and this was confirmed by aligning the ~60 bp nucleosomal sequences with the genome sequence. a transcriptome map has not been established for t. kodakarensis but, based on bioinformatic predictions  <cit> , non-transcribed intergenic regions are preferentially depleted of nucleosomes. genome-wide, there was a substantial underrepresentation of nucleosomes immediately upstream of translation initiation codons  and, in multigene operons, this was predominantly upstream of the promoter proximal gene. for example, tk1761-tk1762-tk <dig> constitutes an operon transcribed divergently from tk <dig>  <cit> . the intergenic region separating tk <dig> and tk <dig> contains several oligo a/t-rich sequences and had minimal nucleosome occupancy in vivo . there was no similar region of nucleosome exclusion downstream from the promoter within the tk1761- <dig> operon.

conservation of archaeal nucleosome positioning in vivo and in vitro
most archaeal histones are single histone folds that form homodimers in solution  <cit> . however, when mixed with other archaeal histone homodimers, there is rapid and spontaneous reassembly that generates an equilibrium mixture of the homodimers and all possible heterodimers  <cit> . m. thermautotrophicus has three histones  <cit>  and t. kodakarensis has two histones  <cit>  and, practically, it is impossible to know their homo- versus heterodimer configurations in vivo, a concern that limits the reproducibility in vitro of results obtained in vivo. the two histones in t. kodakarensis, htka and htkb are encoded by tk <dig> and tk <dig>  respectively, and although constructing a strain with both genes deleted proved impossible, t. kodakarensis lc <dig>  and lc <dig>  were constructed  <cit> . these strains therefore contain only one archaeal histone and, by heterologous expression of tk <dig> and tk <dig>  preparations of recombinant htka and htkb homodimers were obtained. direct comparisons could therefore be made of the locations of archaeal nucleosomes assembled by only htka or htkb, in vivo and in vitro, on t. kodakarensis genomic dna. the archaeal nucleosome profiles were very similar in vivo and in vitro throughout the length of the t. kodakarensis genome . the pattern of nucleosome depletion immediately upstream of translation codons was conserved  and there was only minimal archaeal nucleosome assembly on the rdna operon both in vivo and in vitro .

as established for the parental strain , the ~60 bp fragments of the t. kodakarensis genome protected from mn digestion by only htka or htkb assembly in vivo and in vitro also contained 10 bp helical-periodicity repeats of aa/at/ta/tt and gg/gc/cg/cc dinucleotides, offset by 5 bp, and pentamers containing only a and/or t were under-represented, and those containing only g and/or c were over-represented, relative to their occurrences in the t. kodakarensis genome . together these results confirm that the positions at which htka and htkb assemble to form archaeal nucleosomes are predominantly determined by the t. kodakarensis genome sequence and, as concluded from eukaryotic nucleosome studies  <cit> , from an archaeal genome sequence  <cit> , it should be possible to predict where archaeal nucleosomes will preferentially assemble in vivo.

evolutionary conservation of the nucleosome positioning code
source , we assembled nucleosomes using eukaryotic histones with archaeal dna and archaeal histones with eukaryotic dna. as expected, based on many previous studies, chicken histone octamers bound m. thermoautotrophicus and t. kodakarensis genomic dnas into nucleosomes that protected ~147 bp dna fragments from mn digestion and, as in figure 1a, ~60 bp fragments of yeast genomic dna were protected from mn digestion by archaeal histone assembly. sequencing these fragments generated  <dig> to  <dig> million unique reads, equating to ~60- to 270-fold coverage per bp, per 60 bp or 147 bp fragment. analyses of the sequences confirmed that the presence of oscillating dinucleotide repeat patterns and the exclusion of a/t-rich pentamers in all the nucleosome-incorporated dnas . aligning the nucleosome profiles confirmed that most sites at which archaeal nucleosomes assembled in vivo were sites at which eukaryotic nucleosomes also assembled preferentially, although less abundantly, in vitro. chicken histone octamers often formed nucleosomes that encompassed two adjacent sites of preferred archaeal nucleosome assembly .

archaeal histone deletion changes transcription and nucleosome positioning
t. kodakarensis lc <dig>  and lc <dig>  exhibit no detectable growth defects but microarray hybridizations revealed that transcripts of 3% to 4% of genes increased or decreased in abundance when compared with their abundances in the parental strain t. kodakarensis ts <dig>  <cit> . comparing the nucleosome profiles in the intergenic regions immediately upstream of these genes in t. kodakarensis ts <dig> versus lc <dig> or lc <dig> revealed clear differences, but no consistent pattern that correlated directly with an increase or decrease in transcript abundance. for example, in t. kodakarensis lc <dig> that lacks htka, transcripts of tk <dig> and tk <dig> increased in abundance  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, but although there was decreased nucleosome assembly upstream of tk <dig>  there was increased assembly upstream of tk <dig> . similarly, in the absence of htka, transcripts of tk <dig> and tk <dig> decreased  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, and there was increased nucleosome assembly upstream of tk <dig>  but there were both regions with decreased and increased nucleosome assembly upstream of tk <dig> .

discussion
conservation and ancestral origin of the nucleosome positioning code
whether a sequence will favor or disfavor assemble into a nucleosome can be predicted from the below- or above-average energy requirements needed to distort that sequence into the circular configuration of dna wrapped around the nucleosome core  <cit> . to a large extent, these predictions have been confirmed experimentally by the sequences of dna isolated from eukaryotic nucleosomes and so in the definition of a nucleosome positioning code  <cit> . the results reported here confirm that two basic features of this code, namely a 10 bp periodicity of aa/at/ta/tt dinucleotides offset by 5 bp from gg/gc/cg/cc dinucleotides, and the exclusion of a/t-rich oligonucleotides also direct archaeal nucleosome assembly in vivo and in vitro. in the structures established for the eukaryotic nucleosome  <cit> , the aa/at/ta/tt dinucleotide repeats facilitate dna wrapping as the dinucleotides that most readily accept the distortion needed  <cit> , where the minor groove faces inwards towards the histone octamer. the gg/gc/cg/cc dinucleotide repeats, offset by half a helical turn, facilitate the distortion needed at each site where the minor groove faces outwards and so away from the nucleosome core  <cit> . to date, despite a significant effort, there is no high resolution structure of an archaeal nucleosome available but, given that the archaeal and eukaryotic histone folds are virtually identical  <cit>  and that dna-histone interactions are almost entirely mediated by histone fold residues  <cit> , it seems highly likely that the same wrapping mechanism is employed and so dna distortion is required to assemble archaeal nucleosomes. given this conservation, the nucleosome positioning code almost certainly predates the eukaryotes, and co-evolved with histones and the histone-fold based mechanism of dna compaction early in the archaeal lineage, before the divergence of euryarchaea, nanoarchaea and thaumarchaea <cit> .

archaeal nucleosome positioning and gene expression
as in bacteria, many archaeal genes are organized into operons and so are co-transcribed from a single promoter and, in the absence of a nuclear membrane; transcription and translation are coupled  <cit> . however, archaeal promoters and the transcription machinery are substantially more similar to their eukaryotic than bacterial counterparts. archaeal transcription initiation requires that both transcription factors and rna polymerase be recruited to the promoter  <cit>  and archaeal histone binding to promoter regions has been shown, alternatively, to inhibit or to stimulate transcription in vitro  <cit> . without a transcriptome, we chose to determine the locations at which htka and htkb assembled into nucleosomes on t. kodakarensis genomic dna, both in vivo and in vitro, relative to translation start codons. this is a reasonable proxy for transcription initiation sites as most archaeal promoters are located within short intergenic regions and so are close to a start codon. as the results revealed, on a genome wide basis, archaeal nucleosomes are excluded from the dna immediately upstream of open reading frames, and these nucleosome depleted regions  are flanked by regions with above average nucleosome occupancy . this is very similar to the pattern of nucleosome occupancy established in promoter regions and around the downstream transcription start sites in the yeast genome  <cit> . the conservation of this nucleosome organization argues strongly for a participatory role in gene expression. possibly, avoiding nucleosome assembly in the promoter region coupled with the presence of a nucleosome at the transcription start site evolved as a generic system to facilitate pre-transcription complex assembly while preventing immediate transcription initiation. if so, a mechanism would then also be needed to remove the inhibitory nucleosome when transcription should occur. in eukaryotes, many complexes have evolved that catalyze histone modifications, nucleosome remodeling, repositioning and/or eviction that relieve transcription inhibition  <cit>  but, to date, there is no evidence for archaeal histone modifications nor for archaeal nucleosome remodeling complexes.

consistent with the presence of an archaeal nucleosome impeding transcription  <cit> , presumably to maximize rrna synthesis, archaeal nucleosome assembly was strongly deterred by the rdna operon sequences, in vivo and in vitro, in both t. kodakarensis  and in m. thermautotrophicus . to test the prediction that the presence of an archaeal nucleosome in a promoter region was sufficient to prevent downstream transcription, we compared the archaeal nucleosomes profiles upstream of genes whose transcription was known to increase or decrease in response to the absence of htka or htkb  <cit> . there were substantial differences in these profiles, in both the abundance and positioning of archaeal nucleosomes, when compared with the parental strain with both histones  but there was no consistent correlation. an increase or decrease in transcription did not simply result from the absence or presence of an archaeal nucleosome in a promoter region.

supporting report
the results of a similar and complementary investigation were published  <cit>  while this report was being finalized. ammar et al.  <cit>  determined the locations of archaeal nucleosomes assembled in vivo in haloferax volcanii, also a euryarchaeon, but a species with a relatively high 65% g + c content, and one with a single atypical archaeal histone that has two histone folds fused into one polypeptide  <cit> . both positioning investigations established that g/c-rich sequences predominate at the center of an archaeal nucleosome but a 10 bp periodicity of aa/at/ta/tt dinucleotides was not detected in the dna incorporated into nucleosomes in hlf. volcanii. in both studies, a ndr flanked by increased nucleosome assembly was documented in intergenic regions but, with a transcriptome available, ammar et al.  <cit>  were able to define the location of the ndr relative to the sites of transcription initiation rather than, as here, to translation start codons. they did not report confirmatory in vitro positioning studies, but the nucleosome positioning in vivo in hlf. volcanii was, as established here both in vivo and in vitro, almost certainly directed primarily by the hlf. volcanii genome sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
the results reported establish that an archaeal histone and genome sequence are sufficient for positioned archaeal nucleosome assembly. they confirm that the primary sequence motifs known to facilitate and direct histone assembly into eukaryotic nucleosomes  <cit>  also direct nucleosome assembly in archaea and that this positioning mechanism therefore almost certainly originated in a common ancestor of archaea and eukaryotes. dna compaction is often described as the primary function of nucleosomes but positioned nucleosomes clearly also participate in regulating eukaryotic gene expression  <cit>  and nucleosome positioning, as a regulatory mechanism, likely predates nucleosome assembly for dna compaction and archiving. when compared with eukaryotic genomes, archaeal  genomes are very small, and many different proteins have been described that participate both in gene expression and prokaryotic genome compaction  <cit> . the first histone may have evolved as a protein that bound preferentially to sequences that encoded amphipathic peptide helices  <cit>  with this sequence-directed binding participating in gene regulation. but, given that the histone fold mechanism of dna binding results in dna wrapping, this would have also inherently resulted in dna compaction. when evaluated in terms of the length of dna compacted per unit of protein, histone wrapping is very efficient, and it is possible that it was the availability of this mechanism, employed by all eukaryotes, that allowed the massive genome expansion needed for eukaryotic evolution  <cit> . it remains to be determined if archaeal histones still function primarily as regulators, as suggested by their depletion in intergenic regions  <cit> , or if genome compaction is their primary function consistent with their observed assembly here throughout the full length of the t. kodakarensis and m. thermautotrophicus genomes.
