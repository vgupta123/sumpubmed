BACKGROUND
tandem mass spectrometry  has been one of the most effective high-throughput approaches for protein identification and quantification. in a typical "bottom-up" approach, also known as the shotgun proteomics strategy, the enzyme-digested protein mixture is analyzed using single- or multi-dimensional chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry  <cit> . a variety of computational approaches have been developed to assign peptide sequences to the acquired ms/ms data. database searching algorithms are the most frequently used methods for large-scale proteomics studies  <cit> . the most popular commercial ms/ms search engines are sequest  <cit>   and mascot  <cit>  . open source tools are also available, such as omssa  <cit> , x! tandem  <cit> , and andromeda  <cit> . although each implementation is different, the general approach of ms/ms search algorithms is similar  <cit> . given a protein sequence database, the search algorithm first generates all in silico-digested peptides upon the specified parameters, such as digestive enzymes, missed cleavages, and modifications. for each ms/ms spectrum, the search engine only evaluates the candidate peptide sequences within a user-defined precursor mass tolerance window. a scoring function is used to calculate a score which represents how well the theoretical spectrum of each candidate peptide matches the observed spectrum. the top scoring peptide hit is reported and then the peptide sequence is assigned to the experimental ms/ms spectrum. protein identifications are inferred by grouping the peptide-spectrum matches  <cit> .

another approach for identifying peptides from fragment ion spectra combines partial de novo sequencing and database searching. short peptide sequence tags are inferred from ms/ms spectra using de novo algorithms. the list of candidate peptides in the database search can be reduced to only those containing the tag  <cit> . the algorithms will then try to extend the sequence tag by finding masses of the flanking residues in the database peptide which match masses of the prefix and suffix regions of the tag  <cit> . although the hybrid approach is still reliant on protein sequence databases, it is an alternative strategy while analyzing peptides with novel modifications or sequence variations  <cit> .

alternative pre-mrna splicing  enables eukaryotes to generate distinct mrnas and therefore multiple protein variants from a single gene. the common approach to developing an alternative splicing database is based on automated large-scale mapping of transcripts and genomic sequences. the massively parallel picolitre-scale sequencing system developed by the  <dig> life sciences corporation was capable of sequencing  <dig> million bases in a four-hour run  <cit> . the  <dig> sequence reads are short, averaging 80- <dig> bases per read. the massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis technology has been used to generate est data of a human prostate cancer cell line, and  <dig> novel alternative exon splicing events were identified  <cit> .

recently, we expanded the target database to include putative alternatively spliced isoforms with the aim that the ms/ms spectra can be better interpreted  <cit> . the results showed that our approach was able to identify more proteins from the experimental spectra and to provide evidence for improving the genome annotation. subsequently, the aspergillus flavus nrrl <dig> whole genome shotgun project had a major update in  <dig>  among  <dig> peptides discovered in our previous study,  <dig> of them were included in the second version of genome annotation. meanwhile,  <dig> sequencing data of a. flavus became available locally. the first goal of this study was to rebuild the alternative splicing database using the latest genome annotation and newly acquired  <dig> sequencing data as transcript evidence. the second part of the study aimed at comparing four ms/ms search algorithms for isoform identifications using the resulting alternative splicing database. we tested three probability-based algorithms, mascot  <cit> , omssa  <cit> , and x! tandem  <cit> , and one sequence tag-based algorithm, inspect  <cit> . the design of the study is illustrated in figure  <dig> 

RESULTS
rebuilding a. flavus alternative splicing database
genome annotation is the result of continuous efforts. an updated version of a. flavus genome annotation was released in  <dig>  compared to the prior genome project, the second version dropped  <dig> previously documented genes and added  <dig> novel ones . a newly acquired collection of  <dig> sequence reads and ests provided the transcription information of half of the genes for predicting splice variants . an updated alternative splicing database was then built using the second version of the genome and all available transcripts. the refseq database  contained  <dig> a. flavus genes and corresponding proteins, with no splice isoform. the updated alternative splicing database predicted another  <dig> putative protein variants . it was estimated that  <dig> %  of the total genes encoded more than one protein,  <dig>   putative isoforms per gene on average. the predicted variant sequences were appended to the collection of the refseq proteins to form a combined database for the following database searches.

comparison of ms/ms search algorithms on identifying putative isoforms
in order to compare the performance of identifying putative splice variants, the same set of ms/ms spectra were searched against the resulting combined database by mascot, omssa, x! tandem, and inspect. although each algorithm already reported internal statistical measures like p-value or e-value, the cut-off thresholds were selected to ensure the search results had an estimated false discovery rate  < 2% for peptide identification . while several isoforms were encoded from the same gene, sometimes the different protein products could not be distinguished by the identified peptides. in such a scenario, it was observed that mascot would pick the protein with the longest sequence from all possible candidates. inspect would also report one protein from the list of candidate sequences, but not necessarily the longest one. in contrast, omssa and x! tandem would report all matched proteins and let users interpret the findings. in order to present the results concisely, we accepted the longest protein sequence to represent the group of all possible matches. if a group of peptides could be mapped to either the refseq protein or the splice variant of the same gene, we conservatively assigned the identification to the refseq protein since no clear conclusion was possible. the number of identified peptides, refseq proteins, and splice variants by algorithms are listed in table  <dig>

to study the consistency between different algorithms on search results, the identified hits were categorized by the algorithms having the same finding . the overlaps were illustrated in four-way venn diagrams as well . for the peptide-spectrum matches, 42%  of peptide assignments were concurred by all four algorithms. since we introduced predicted isoform sequences into the database, the protein identification was divided into two subgroups: refseq proteins and putative splice variants. 51%  of the identified refseq proteins were consistent across all algorithms. in contrast, only 15%  of the putative splice variants were identified unanimously.

to investigate whether different algorithms assigned the same spectrum to different peptide sequences, the peptide-spectrum matches were examined within and between algorithms . it was observed for all algorithms that 1% or fewer spectra were assigned to different peptides by the same tool. the inconsistency expanded but never exceeded 2% while comparing the assignment of the same spectrum between different algorithms. it also appeared that inspect assigned more spectra differently in comparison with other three probability-based algorithms. the multiple peptides assigned from the same spectra between algorithms might account for a part of the identification variations.

it was not surprising to see that the number of peptide-spectrum matches and protein hits dropped while reducing the false discovery rate. however, most of the removed hits belonged to the identifications reported by only one algorithm . the consensus hits of multiple algorithms seemed more likely to be the correct identification. in the comparison of the overlaps between search results, the identified splice variants between different algorithms showed greater variations than the refseq proteins. it is noted that the prediction of all possible splice variants from ests tends to be over-estimated. to reduce the false positive results, we compiled a list of top splice isoform candidates by taking advantage of the consensus peptides. by focusing on those variant-specific peptides identified by at least three different algorithms,  <dig> putative isoforms were reported .  <dig> splice variants were inferred by all four algorithms. the scores, p-values, and e-values of the assignments looked satisfying. none of these specific peptide sequences appeared in any refseq proteins. in addition, no two consensus peptides came from the same spectra. as an example, one putative isoform discovered through the strategy was further analyzed below.

conserved domain analysis of putative isoforms of udp-galactose 4-epimerase
udp-glucose 4-epimerase   plays a pivotal role in normal galactose metabolism, converting udp-galactose back to udp-glucose in the final step of the leloir pathway  <cit> . nad+ is required to be a cofactor in the catalytic mechanism. five uge isoforms encoded in the arabidopsis thaliana genome differed in enzymatic properties, transcript regulation, and subcellular localization  <cit> . the ms/ms spectrum which was used to assign the consensus peptide favetaitdvinaqr in the putative uge isoform was examined . the abundant matched b- and y- ions, accurate precursor ion mass, and expected mass difference from the silac pair observed in the spectrum correlated well with the low expectation value or p-value reported by algorithms.

according to the annotation of refseq release  <dig>  a. flavus udp-glucose 4-epimerase  contained four coding exons . the corresponding splice variant generated from our prediction had three exons instead: the first two were constitutive and the third was alternative . since different sets of peptide-spectrum matches were used to conclude the protein identification between search algorithms, the peptides shown in figure  <dig> are based on mascot's result. the alternative exon in the protein variant was supported by the distinctive peptide favetaitdvinaqr which was located in an intron of the corresponding refseq protein. the encoding variant sequence ended approximately in the middle of the third coding exon of the refseq counterpart. a group of  <dig> peptides which were mapped to the remaining coding sequence supported the identification of the refseq protein.

while multiple protein products are encoded from the same gene, different isoforms are usually destined for performing various biological functions. thus, we were interested in learning whether two identified uge isoforms had different functional motifs among their sequences. the conserved domain database , part of ncbi's entrez database system, is a protein annotation resource that consists of a collection of well-annotated multiple sequence alignment models as position-specific score matrices   <cit> . two motifs were found by searching the refseq sequence against cdd  . one was a member of the rossmann-fold nad-binding proteins superfamily, 3-ketoacyl- reductase , and the other was udp-glucose 4-epimerase . a different member of the rossmann-fold nad-binding proteins superfamily, short chain dehydrogenase , was found in the sequence of the alternatively spliced variant . udp-galactose 4-epimerase is known as a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. these enzymes contain a conserved tyr-x-x-x-lys motif necessary for catalytic activity. the characteristic yxxxk motif of human epimerase was located at tyr-157-gly-lys-ser-lys- <dig>  <cit> . the yxxxk signature sequence, tyr-156-gly-asn-thr-lys- <dig> , was also found in the predicted variant sequence of a. flavus uge. the different sets of motifs found in two uge proteins suggested the putative isoforms may carry out different functions in vivo.

discussion
a new a. flavus alternative splicing database was rebuilt referencing the latest genome annotation. by incorporating new qualified  <dig> sequence reads, more splice variants were predicted from more genes compared to the previous database. though several previously discovered peptides had been included in the updated proteome, newly predicted variants were identified from the improved database using the same set of spectra. according to the mascot results,  <dig> additional proteins from  <dig> genes were found in the previous study  <cit>  while the  <dig> putative isoforms encoded by  <dig> genes were reported in this study. the results suggested that the increase of transcript sequences was able to predict eligible splice variants though the genome had been updated recently.

different groups have conducted comparative evaluations of ms/ms search algorithms  <cit> . the variation in scoring functions and statistical significance techniques in database-searching algorithms give different identification results. the overlaps of the search results from multiple algorithms can shift significantly as search parameters are modified  <cit> . however, those studies were performed using general protein databases without emphasizing alternatively spliced isoforms. in this study, mascot, omssa, x! tandem, and inspect were compared using an alternative splicing database. in spite of the agreement on 42% of peptide and 51% of refseq protein identifications, our results showed that 15% of the putative splice isoforms were detected by all algorithms . the fact that less than 2% of spectra were assigned to multiple peptide sequences did not explain all the variation in isoform identifications .

to be cautious, we chose the refseq protein to represent a protein group when there was no decisive peptide belonging to the putative isoforms. this allowed different algorithms to assign various peptide groups to the same refseq protein, thus might indirectly increase the refseq protein identifications. on the other hand, the inference of isoform detection mainly relied on identifying the unique peptides which exclusively belonged to variant sequences . as a result, the difference in peptide identifications might lead to a greater variation in isoform identifications. the variation between the splice variants identified by different algorithms implied that many unique peptides concluded by one algorithm were not necessarily recognized by another. especially when the existence of putative isoforms was suggested by one or two isoform-specific peptides, an incorrect identification or missed detection of the specific peptides can change the conclusion immensely. combination of multiple ms/ms search methods was used to distinguish the correct peptide identifications from the incorrect  <cit>  and improve peptide identification rates  <cit> . we took advantage of consensus peptides assigned by at least three algorithms to generate  <dig> top candidate isoforms from the search results having estimated fdrs < 2% . a recent study showed that the error rate of peptide hits was effectively reduced to  <dig> % when a minimum of three engines were used  <cit> . the multiple search engine approach for peptide assignment not only takes advantage of differences in scoring functions to expand the target space for searching, but also bolsters the confidence of the peptide identifications  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the prediction of the alternatively spliced variants based on est sequences by a computational pipeline inclines to be over-estimated and may contain errors. the introduction of putative isoforms into the protein database can further lower the p-value of peptide identifications because of the increasing size of the database. consensus decision making exploits the goodness of multiple search algorithms to validate the assignment results of spectral data at a relatively low cost. the approach is particularly valuable while making inferences in isoform identifications from an alternative splicing database.
