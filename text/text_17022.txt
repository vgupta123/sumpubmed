BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  are important human intestinal pathogens. this pathotype is sub-grouped into typical  and atypical  epec  <cit> . these sub-groups differ according to the presence of the eaf plasmid, which is found only in the former group  <cit> . recent epidemiological studies have shown an increasing prevalence of aepec in both developed and developing countries  <cit> .

the main characteristic of epec's pathogenicity is the development of a histopathologic phenotype in infected eukaryotic cells known as attaching/effacing  lesion. this lesion is also formed by enterohemorrhagic e. coli , another diarrheagenic e. coli pathotype whose main pathogenic mechanism is the production of shiga toxin  <cit> . the a/e lesion comprises microvillus destruction and intimate bacterial adherence to enterocyte membranes, supported by a pedestal rich in actin and other cytoskeleton components  <cit> . the ability to produce pedestals can be identified in vitro by the fluorescence actin staining  assay that detects actin accumulation underneath adherent bacteria indicative of pedestal generation  <cit> . the genes involved in the establishment of a/e lesions are located in a chromosomal pathogenicity island named the locus of enterocyte effacement   <cit> . these genes encode a group of proteins involved in the formation of a type iii secretion system , an outer membrane adhesin called intimin  <cit> , its translocated receptor , chaperones and several other effector proteins that are injected into the targeted eukaryotic cell by the t3ss  <cit> .

differentiation of intimin alleles represents an important tool for epec and ehec typing in routine diagnosis as well as in pathogenesis, epidemiological, clonal and immunological studies. the intimin c-terminal end is responsible for receptor binding, and it has been suggested that different intimins may be responsible for different host tissue cell tropism . the 5' regions of eae genes are conserved, whereas the 3' regions are heterogeneous. thus far  <dig> eae variants encoding  <dig> different intimin types and sub-types have been established: α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig> , β <dig>  γ <dig>  γ <dig>  δ , ε <dig>  ε <dig> , ε <dig>  ε <dig>  ε <dig> , ζ, η <dig>  η <dig>  θ, ι <dig>  ι <dig> , κ, λ, μb, νb, ο, π, ρ and σ .

in hela and hep- <dig> cells, tepec expresses localized adherence   that is mediated by the bundle forming pilus , which is encoded on the eaf plasmid. in contrast, most aepec express the la-like pattern, which is often detected in prolonged incubation periods  . however, during the characterization of an aepec collection, vieira et al.  <cit>  detected  <dig> strains that formed characteristic la on hela cells despite the absence of bfp. further studies showed that these strains also lacked the adhesin-encoding genes of other diarrheagenic e. coli pathotypes  <cit> . therefore, an exemplary strain  was studied in further detail. subsequently, it was shown that in this strain the la pattern actually corresponded to an invasion process mediated by the interaction of the intimin sub-type omicron  <cit> . the clinical significance of these findings in the pathogenicity of aepec in vivo is currently unknown.

despite the fact that epec is generally considered an extracellular pathogen, some studies have shown limited invasion of intestinal epithelium of humans and animals by tepec in vivo  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that some tepec and aepec strains are able to invade distinct cellular lineages in vitro  <cit> . due to variations in the protocols used to determine the invasion indexes, it is difficult to compare the extent of the reported invasion ability among strains of tepec and aepec pathotypes. furthermore, in the literature there are only a few studies on the ability of aepec strains to invade intestinal cells  <cit> . most tepec and aepec invasion studies have been performed on hep- <dig>  <cit> , and polarized intestinal caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . invasion studies with aepec and intestinal t <dig> cells, which are phenotypically similar to human colon epithelial cells are still lacking. since aepec is a heterogeneous pathotype  <cit> , additional analysis of the invasive ability of aepec strains in vitro are necessary. these data could contribute to evaluate whether the invasion capacity might be considered as an additional virulence mechanism in other aepec strains. therefore, in this study, we evaluated aepec strains expressing intimin sub-types omicron and non-omicron regarding their ability to invade hela and differentiated intestinal t <dig> cells. the eukaryotic cell structures involved in the initial steps of entry of aepec 1551- <dig> were also examined.

RESULTS
recent studies have shown that aepec consist of a heterogeneous group of strains, some of which could represent tepec strains that lost the eaf plasmid , ehec/stec strains that lost stx phage sequences, or even e. coli from the normal flora that had gained the lee region  <cit> . it remains to be elucidated whether these strains bear additional and/or specific virulence properties that are not present in tepec.

recently, it has been shown that aepec strain 1551- <dig> invades hela cells in a process dependent on intimin omicron  <cit> . the aepec 1551- <dig> invasive index was about  <dig> folds that of tepec prototype strain e2348/ <dig> tested in the same conditions. however, it is not known whether other aepec strains expressing intimin omicron or other intimin sub-types are also invasive. in the present study this issue was investigated.

in order to identify the intimin sub-type of four strains carrying unknown intimin sub-types, a fragment of the 3' variable region of the eae gene from the four aepec strains included in this study was amplified and sequenced . four different intimin types were identified: θ <dig> , σ , τ  and upsilon . we have detected in aepec strains 4281- <dig> and 1632- <dig>  two new intimin genes eae-τ and eae-ν that showed less than 95% nucleotide sequence identity with existing intimin genes. furthermore, a third new variant of the eae gene  was identified in the aepec strain 1871- <dig> . the complete nucleotide sequences of the new eae-θ <dig> , eae-τ   and eae-upsilon;  variant genes were determined. by using clustal w  <cit>  for optimal sequence alignment, we determined the genetic relationship of the three new intimin genes and the remaining  <dig> eae variants. a genetic identity of 90% was calculated between the new eae-τ  variant and eae-γ <dig> , eae-θ  and eae-σ  genes. the eae-upsilon; showed a 94% of identity with eae-ι <dig>  the eae-θ <dig>  gene is very similar  to eae-θ of tarr & whittam  <cit>  and to eae-γ <dig> of oswald et al.  <cit> .

adhesion pattern detected on hela cells: localized adherence , localized adherence like , aggregative adherence  and diffuse adherence  .  strains that had eae gene sequenced in this study and  strains that carry new intimin subtypes ; 4281- <dig>  and 1632- <dig> .

quantitative assessment of bacterial invasion was performed with all strains, but different incubation-periods were used to test aepec strains  and tepec e2348/ <dig> , because the latter colonizes more efficiently  than aepec strains  <cit>  and induce cell-detachment after  <dig> h of incubation . the quantitative gentamicin protection assay confirmed the invasive ability of aepec 1551- <dig> in hela cells and showed that  <dig> of the other  <dig> aepec strains studied were also significantly more invasive than tepec e2348/ <dig> . the percentages of invasion found varied between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, for aepec strains 4051- <dig>  and 0621- <dig> . when compared to tepec e2348/ <dig>  , the invasion indexes of all strains were significantly higher , except for aepec strain 4281- <dig> . these data confirmed that invasion of hela cells is not exclusively found in strains expressing intimin sub-type omicron. however, different degrees of cell invasion were observed . although all aepec strains studied were devoid of known e. coli genes supporting invasion  <cit> , they are heterogeneous regarding the presence of additional virulence genes  <cit> . however, it remains to be evaluated whether the invasion ability as shown for aepec 1551- <dig>  <cit>  of other aepec strains could be associated with the intimin sub-type. furthermore, differences in invasion index could also be related to the presence of other factors, such as lee and non-lee effector proteins or expression of additional virulence genes. alternatively, the affinity of both intimin and a specific tir counterpart could influence the degree of manipulation of the cytoskeleton thus favoring less or more pronounced invasion.

in order to identify the host cell structures and processes that might be involved in hela cells invasion by aepec 1551- <dig>  we treated the cells with reagents affecting the cytoskeleton such as cytochalasin d  or colchicine  prior to infection. optical microscopy analysis revealed that treatment with cytochalasin d did not affect bacterial adhesion . however, significantly decreased invasion by aepec 1551- <dig>  was detected, as observed with the invasive s. enterica sv typhimurium control strain  and s. flexneri . these results indicate that a functional host cell actin cytoskeleton is necessary for aepec 1551- <dig> uptake . in addition, this suggests that a/e lesion formation may be necessary for the invasion process since inhibition of actin polymerization resulted in both prevention of a/e lesion formation and decreased invasion. in contrast, aepec 1551- <dig> adherence  and invasion  were unaffected by colchicine cell treatment . this indicates that the microtubule network is not involved in the invasion process. as expected, s. enterica sv typhimurium , and s. flexneri , were neither affected by treating cells with colchicine.

hela cells are derived from a human uterine cervix carcinoma. they are widely used to study bacterial interactions with epithelial cells yet they do not represent an adequate host cell type to mimic human gastrointestinal infections. to examine whether aepec strains would also invade intestinal epithelial cells, we infected t <dig> cells , cultivated for  <dig> days for polarization and differentiation, with all  <dig> aepec strains. the ability of these strains to promote a/e lesions in t <dig> cells was confirmed by fas . in the gentamicin protection assays performed with these cells,  <dig> of  <dig> strains were significantly more invasive than the prototype tepec strain e2348/ <dig> . the exception was aepec 4051- <dig>  that showed similar invasion index as tepec e2348/ <dig> . the invasion indexes of the  <dig> aepec strains varied from  <dig> % ±  <dig>   to  <dig> % ±  <dig>  . these results demonstrate that besides invading hela cells, aepec strains carrying distinct intimin subtypes invade epithelial cells of human intestinal origin to different levels. interestingly, the aepec invasion indexes were significantly higher than that of tepec e2348/ <dig>  but this comparison should be made with caution since the incubation-periods used were different. nonetheless, it has already been demonstrated that tepec is unable to efficiently invade fully differentiated intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . to confirm invasiveness, we examined t <dig> cells infected with aepec strains by transmission electron microscopy . this approach confirmed that  <dig> out of  <dig> aepec strains tested promoted a/e lesion formation and were also internalized . under the conditions used, although some tepec e2348/ <dig> cells were intra-cellular, most remained extra-cellular and intimately attached to the epithelial cell surface . except for aepec strains 4281- <dig> in hela cells and 4051- <dig> in t <dig> cells, the remaining four strains tested were more invasive than tepec e2348/ <dig> and showed heterogeneous invasion index in both hela and t <dig> cells.

it has been reported that the interaction between afa/dr adhesins, expressed by strains of the diarrheagenic e. coli pathotype diffusely adherent e. coli , and α5β <dig> integrins also results in bacterial internalization  <cit> . adaptation to the intracellular environment help bacteria to avoid physical stresses  and many other host defense mechanisms including cellular exfoliation, complement deposition, antibody opsonization and subsequent recognition by macrophages or cytotoxic t cells  <cit> . thus, the development of mechanisms for host cell invasion, host immune response escape, intracellular replication and/or dissemination to the neighboring cells is an important strategy for intracellular bacteria  <cit> .

tight junctions of polarized intestinal cells usually represent a barrier to bacterial invasion. some studies have shown increased invasion indexes when cells are treated prior to infection with chemical agents that disrupt tight junctions and expose receptors on the basolateral side  <cit> . similar observations have been made with bacteria infecting undifferentiated  eukaryotic cells  <cit> . these studies have shown a relationship between the differentiation stage of the particular host cells and the establishment of invasion  <cit> . therefore, in order to examine whether aepec strains could also invade via the basolateral side of differentiated t <dig> cells, these cells were treated with different egta concentrations to open the epithelial tight junctions. the egta effect was accessed by optical microscopy . following this procedure, cells were infected with aepec 1551- <dig> and tepec e2348/ <dig>  infections with s. enterica sv typhimurium and s. flexneri were used as controls. this treatment promoted a significant enhancement of aepec 1551- <dig> and s. flexneri invasion,  but s. enterica sv typhimurium and tepec e2348/ <dig> invasion indexes were not affected by the disruption of the epithelial cell tight junctions as was also reported previously  <cit> .

to address a putative effect of egta on the invasion ability of the aepec strains we also cultivated t <dig> cells for  <dig> days on the lower surface of a transwell membrane. in this manner, bacterial contact with the basolateral cell surface can be achieved without prior treatment of the t <dig> cells. preparations were examined by tem and the images suggest enhanced bacterial invasion and show bacteria within vacuoles  confirming the results obtained with egta treated t <dig> cells. regarding tepec e2348/ <dig>  no internalized bacteria was found in the microscope fields observed. enteropathogens may gain access to basolateral receptors and promote host cell invasion in vivo by transcytosis through m cells  <cit> . alternatively, some infectious processes can cause perturbations in the intestinal epithelium, e.g., neutrophil migration during intestinal inflammation; as a consequence, a transitory destabilization in the epithelial barrier is promoted exposing the basolateral side and allowing bacterial invasion  <cit> . with regard to tepec, it has been reported that an effector molecule, espf is involved in tight junction disruption and redistribution of occludin with ensuing increased permeability of t <dig> monolayers  <cit> . whether espf is involved in the invasion ability of the aepec strains studied in vivo remains to be investigated.

in conclusion, we showed that aepec strains expressing distinct intimin sub-types are able to invade both hela and differentiated t <dig> cells. at least for the invasive aepec 1551- <dig> strain, hela cell invasion requires actin filaments but does not involve microtubules. in differentiated t <dig> cells, disruption of tight junctions increases the invasion capacity of aepec 1551- <dig>  this observation could be significant in infantile diarrhea since in newborns and children the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier might not be fully developed  <cit> . as observed in uropathogenic e. coli  <cit> , besides representing a mechanism of escape from the host immune response, invasion could also be a strategy for the establishment of persistent disease. it is possible, that the previously reported association of aepec with prolonged diarrhea  <cit>  is the result of limited invasion processes. however, the in vivo relevance of our in vitro observations remains to be established. moreover, further analyses of the fate of the intracellular bacteria such as persistence, multiplication and spreading to neighboring cells are necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we verified that aepec strains, carrying distinct intimin sub-types, including three new ones, may invade eukaryotic cells in vitro. hela cells seem to be more susceptible to aepec invasion than differentiated and polarized t <dig> cells, probably due to the absence of tight junctions in the former cell type. we also showed that actin microfilaments are required for efficient invasion of aepec strain 1551- <dig> thus suggesting that a/e lesion formation is an initial step for the invasion process of hela cells, while microtubules are not involved in such phenomenon. our results also showed that tight junctions' disruption increased significantly the invasion of t <dig> cells by aepec strain 1551- <dig>  altogether, our findings suggest that aepec strains may invade intestinal cells in vitro with varying efficiencies and that the invasion process proceeds apparently independently of the intimin sub-type.
