BACKGROUND
in plants cytosine methylation occurs at symmetric 5′-cpg-3′ dyads  and 5′-cphpg-3′  triads, in addition to asymmetric 5′-cphph-3′  triads . in each case, methylation is controlled by distinct dna methyltransferases. in arabidopsis thaliana, the main cg, chg and chh methylases are methyltransferase <dig> , chromomethylase  <dig>  and chromomethylase  <dig>  or domains-rearranged methyltransferase  <dig> , respectively. in maize, the corresponding homologs are zmet <dig> and zmet <dig> or  <dig>  cmt <dig> is absent and zmet <dig> . in addition, the domains-rearranged methyltransferase  <dig>  plays an important role in the rna-directed dna methylation pathway  <cit> , first discovered in tobacco plants  <cit> , which culminates with de novo methylation of cytosine in cg, chg and chh contexts in response to small rna signals .

the genome-wide distribution of dna methylation has been detailed both in arabidopsis  <cit>  and agronomically important plants such as rice, maize, soybean, cassava, soybean, common bean, wheat and cotton . collectively, these studies show that the bulk of dna methylation is located within transposable elements , underlining its important and well-characterized function - proposed several years ago - in regulating te activity  <cit> . in addition, those data also uncovered the prevalence of cg methylation within the gene-body.

to date, nearly all genome-wide methylation studies of natural variation in dna methylation, either within a genetically identical population following several generations, or across distinct genetic populations or tissue-types, compare average dna methylation states of pooled individuals or less than  <dig> individuals per generation . however, the few studies that take inter-individual variation into account, show that both natural and stress-induced methylation responses are heterogeneous across individuals and can vary between developmental stages . all the aforementioned studies were performed using the methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism  technique. although this technique only surveys the methylation state of a defined restriction enzyme site that is sensitive to dna methylation , it does give a reliable readout of the genome-wide methylation state. as an example, we demonstrated that the 13% reduction in dna methylation in maize endosperm relative to leaf and embryo tissues largely resulted from maternal hypomethylation  <cit> , results that were subsequently confirmed by high-throughput bisulfite sequencing of arabidopsis, rice, sorghum, maize and castor bean genomes .

currently scarce information is available regarding inter-individual methylation variation  across genetically identical progeny and whether such variation differs across plant tissues. given the lack of such studies, we analysed methylation profiles of ten individual leaf and endosperm tissues derived from single cobs of two hybrid and one inbred line by msap. furthermore, since pooled samples have been used in the majority of dna methylation variation studies, we addressed the important methodological issue of whether individual samples better reflect methylation variation compared to pooled samples. our data reveal that ii-mv is readily detected in both leaf and endosperm tissue, but largely restricted to tissue-specific differentially methylated regions . we find that the majority of such variation is detectable by analysis of pooled samples and show that msap represents a reliable alternative to wgbs for analysing methylation variation.

RESULTS
characterization of inter-individual methylation variation  in maize endosperm and leaf using msap
msap was employed to characterize ii-mv. this technique is a modification of aflp , which is based on random amplification of restriction fragments typically generated by digestion of genomic dna with ecori and msei restriction enzymes  <cit> . in msap, msei is replaced by hpaii, which cleaves ccgg sites, unless one or both cytosines are methylated on both strands  <cit> . adaptors are ligated to digested restriction sites and resulting fragments are subsequently amplified in two consecutive pcr reactions with primers complementary to core sequence of adaptors and recognition sites of restriction enzymes. typically, the number of selective nucleotides added to the primers at 3′ ends is increased in the second amplification reaction. in addition, one primer is radioactively labelled to enable visualization of restriction fragments by autoradiography.

ten individual endosperms harvested 15 days after pollination  and ten 14-day-old leaves  were analysed by msap and aflp using  <dig> and  <dig> selective primer combinations, respectively. in either case, tissue samples were derived from a single hybrid cob. a total of  <dig>  and 3%  of endosperm and leaf msap fragments, respectively, showed variation across individuals . the higher number of total msap fragments in endosperm versus leaf  was expected given that the former is hypomethylated relative to leaf  <cit> . conversely, no variation was detected by aflp . further msap analyses of individual endosperms and leaves from the mo17/b <dig> hybrid, in addition to individual endosperms from the a69y inbred line, revealed that ii-mv did not differ significantly, neither between genetic background, nor between inbred and hybrid lines . subsequently, we scored ii-mv of tissue-specific or common msap fragments of the two hybrid crosses; i.e. of msap bands detected in one or both tissues, respectively . in either hybrid, ii-mv was significantly increased of tissue-specific compared to common msap band . however, neither common nor tissue-specific msap fragments showed significant differences in ii-mv between tissues.fig.  <dig> msap analysis of individual tissues derived from a single cob of w23/a69y hybrid . a msap analysis of  <dig> individual two-week-old leaves and  <dig> dap endosperms; arrows indicate tissue-specific and common msap fragments that vary across individual endosperm and leaves ; b msap analysis of  <dig> individual endosperms using either hpaii  or mspi  in the initial restriction digest; panels shows examples of inter-individual variation in cg methylation  and chg methylation, or cg and chg methylation

next, we assessed whether ii-mv occurred preferentially of cytosines in a cg or chg context by comparing msap profiles of individual endosperms from the w23/a69y hybrid using either hpaii or its isoschizomer mspi in the initial restriction digest. these restriction enzymes differ in their sensitivity to methylation of the ccgg recognition site: hpaii is sensitive to methylation of either cytosine residues, but is insensitive to hemi-methylation of the external cytosine residue, whereas mspi is sensitive to hemi- or complete methylation of the external cytosine. we found that 89% of ii-mv occurred in a cg context; i.e. variation was only detected following hpaii, but not mspi digestion . in 37%  of such cases, no fragment was detected with mspi . this suggested either that the external cytosine residue of the ccgg recognition site was hemi-methylated, or the presence of an internal hpaii site that was methylated in a cg context only. the latter explanation is likely given that ~20% of msap fragments have internal ccgg sites  <cit> . in contrast, only 11%  of ii-mv occurred exclusively in a chg context, or in both a cg and chg context; i.e. band absence following both hpaii and mspi digestion .

to understand whether these profiles reflected context-dependent endosperm-specific hypomethylation, we performed an in vitro methyl-accepting assay on  <dig> dap endosperms and 14-day-old leaf tissues from the w <dig> inbred line. this assay exploits the ability of bacterial dna hpaii and mspi methylases to methylate the internal and external cytosine of unmethylated ccgg sequences, respectively  <cit> . in addition, total cg methylation was measured with the sssi methylase, which methylates cytosines in cpg dinucleotides independent of sequence context. although cg methylation levels were increased twofold relative to chg methylation, the methylation level of either was reduced fivefold in endosperm compared to leaf . this contrasts with a comparative methyl-seq analysis of  <dig> dap endosperm and leaf tissue from the b <dig> inbred line where only chg methylation differed significantly between leaf and endosperm tissues  <cit> . this discrepancy may result either from inbred or developmental-specific differences in methylation, or alternatively from technical issues related to amplification of bisulfite-treated dna such as selective enrichment of unmethylated alleles  <cit> .table  <dig> methyl-accepting assay of endosperm and leaf dna

the methylation state of pooled samples largely reflects the predominant methylation profile across individual samples
given that genome-wide studies are frequently performed on dna pooled from several individuals, we asked to what extent the methylation state of a dna sample from pooled individuals captured ii-mv. first, we performed an msap experiment to detail the limits of detection of particular methylation profiles. to this end, we analysed the inbred lines mo <dig> and b <dig> and their respective reciprocal crosses by msap and identified  <dig> msap fragments that were specific to the b <dig> inbred line. subsequently, we scored for the presence or absence of these fragments in an “artificial” b73/mo <dig> hybrid where the genomic contribution of b <dig> ranged between  <dig> and 100%; i.e. ten dilution series at 10% intervals that were generated by spiking b <dig> dna with dna from the mo <dig> inbred line. these experiments showed that all b73-specific bands were consistently detected when the genomic contribution of b <dig> was higher than 30%. however, at a  <dig> and 20% b <dig> genomic contribution, the fidelity of detection dropped to  <dig> and 85%, respectively. translating these results to interpreting msap variability data, the majority of band absence occurs when methylation levels are >90%, while methylation levels between  <dig> and 90% are indistinguishable. furthermore, these data suggest that a discrete portion of fragments that are only present in 10–30% of analysed individuals could represent profiles that cannot be accurately determined by msap. this prompted us to analyse the frequency of ii-mv in leaf and endosperm tissues of either hybrid line. this frequency was calculated as number of individuals where a band is present divided by total number of individuals analysed. in either tissue, the bulk of variable fragments were detected in more than 30% of individuals analysed - i.e.  <dig> and 64% of mo17/b <dig> leaf and endosperm msap fragments, respectively; the corresponding values were  <dig> and 72% in the w23/a69y hybrid . this indicated that most msap ii-mv represented true biological variation. next, we assessed whether the most abundant methylation state observed across individual leaves and endosperms from the mo17/b <dig> hybrid was accurately captured in a pooled sample of either tissue. as expected, the majority of endosperm and leaf msap fragments that were present in less than 50% of individuals were associated with band absence in the pooled profile, while msap fragments that were present in more than 40% of individuals showed the opposite behaviour . in total, these fragments accounted for  <dig> and 80% of leaf and endosperm variable msap fragments, respectively. of the remaining leaf and endosperm msap fragments that deviated from expected profiles,  <dig> and 90%, respectively, represented low frequency demethylation events  . taken together, the data suggest that msap analysis of pooled samples is less effective in capturing low, than high-frequency demethylation events across individuals.fig.  <dig> frequency of inter-individual methylation variation . a the percentage of endosperm and leaf msap fragments with ii-mv frequencies < <dig> or >30%; frequencies were scored as the percentage of individuals where a band was detected/total number of individuals analysed; b percentage of endosperm and leaf variable msap fragments that were present or absent in msap profiles from pooled individuals; percentages were compared of ii-mv frequencies that were <50% or >40%




validation of msap data
we excised a total of  <dig> msap fragments that either lacked or showed ii-mv in the mo17/b <dig> hybrid. following sequence analysis,  <dig> non-variable and  <dig> variable fragments reached our stringent criteria for further analysis . we also identified six variable and eight non-variable previously isolated msap fragments  <cit>  that showed ii-mv in the w23/a69y hybrid. using selected fragments as probes in southern blot analysis we confirmed that endosperm-specific variable msap fragments showed reduced levels of both cg and chg methylation in endosperm relative to leaf tissue, while these profiles were largely identical of a non-variable fragment . in addition, we compared ii-mv in cg and chg context of two variable fragments and one non-variable msap fragment using the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes hpaii and mspi, respectively . both variable msap fragments showed ii-mv in a cg context, while variation in chg context was restricted to the variable pmp <dig> band. conversely, no evidence of inter-individual variation was observed following digestion with the ecori and ecorv restriction enzymes that are generally considered methylation-insensitive . likewise, no inter-individual variation was detected of the non-variable fragment, neither with methylation-sensitive nor methylation-insensitive restriction enzymes.

we also validated the methylation states of variable and non-variable hpaii sites predicted by msap using the publicly available wgbs data from leaf tissue of b <dig> and mo <dig> inbred lines  <cit> . to this end, we successfully mapped 17/ <dig> non-variable and 24/ <dig> variable msap fragments to unique regions of the b <dig> inbred line genome   and recovered the methylation state of each hpaii sites. the remaining msap fragments, showed partial or ambiguous overlap to the reference genome and/or lacked methylation data. next, we predicted the methylation state of mapped variable and non-variable hpaii sites in leaf based on the presence or absence of msap fragments across endosperm and leaf individuals . most non-variable fragments  were detected in both tissues - and in all individuals - and were thus predicted to be unmethylated in both leaf and endosperm. conversely, the non-variable fragment that was specifically detected in endosperm samples was considered methylated in leaf. using similar arguments, 79% of variable fragments  were expected to show some degree of methylation in leaf, while the remaining 21% were predicted to lack methylation in this tissue . overall, 85% of the predicted methylation states of individual hpaii sites were confirmed in wgbs data of cytosine methylation in a cg context . in particular, the predicted unmethylated state was confirmed - in at least one of the two inbred lines- of  <dig>  and 100%  of non-variable and variable fragments, respectively; the corresponding percentages for the predicted methylated state were  <dig>  and 79% , respectively. with respect to chg methylation, we found that fewer non-variable and variable hpaii sites were associated with chg methylation. in addition, chg methylation levels were significantly lower that cg methylation levels in both the b <dig> and mo <dig> inbred line  .

collectively, these data confirmed that ii-mv was largely restricted to tdmrs and preferentially associated with cg methylation. conversely the analysed non-variable regions were largely unmethylated in either tissue.

characteristics of isolated variable and non-variable fragments
most variable and non-variable hpaii sites mapped within genic regions - i.e. <2 kb up or downstream of transcriptional start and termination sites annotated in the maize b <dig> refgen_v <dig>  - in particular within the gene-body, defined as the region between tss and tts . with respect to cg and chg methylation, the latter was more abundant within intergenic regions, while cg methylation was largely restricted to genic regions, both of non-variable and variable hpaii sites . furthermore, analysis of dna regions that extended 10 kb up- and downstream of non-variable and variable hpaii sites showed that their generally unmethylated and methylated state, respectively was characteristic of an extended dna region ranging from ~1–10 kb in size . with respect to genes harbouring variable and non-variable hpaii sites,  <dig>  and 56%  respectively, had a paralogue in maize, while  <dig> and 50%, respectively, had an orthologue in arabidopsis thaliana. many of the annotated functions of these genes were related to dynamic cellular processes such as transcription and cell signalling .fig.  <dig> characteristics of variable and non-variable hpaii sites. a genomic distribution of variable and non-variable hpaii sites; genic regions were defined as being within 2 kb up or downstream, respectively of transcriptional start  and termination sites  annotated in maize b <dig> refgen_v4; intergenic regions were defined as being more than 2 kb up or down-stream, respectively of tss and tts; b levels of cg and chg methylation of variable  and non-variable  hpaii sites located within genic  and intergenic  regions ; the y-axis indicates methylation levels between  <dig> and  <dig>  derived from wgbs of b <dig>  and mo <dig>  leaf tissue  <cit> ; c illustrative examples of cg and chg methylation levels of genomic regions located 10 kb up- and downstream of non-variable and variable hpaii sites located either within genic  or intergenic  regions; arrowheads indicate positions of variable and non-variable hpaii sites




we also assessed whether hpaii sites that showed ii-mv tended to map closer to a repetitive dna region. as a control group, we included non-variable hpaii sites. in each case, we scored the distance to the closest repeat region and annotated both its size and classification. we found that 88% of variable hpaii sites were closest to class i or ii transposable elements , while the majority of non-variable hpaii sites  were closer to a tandem repeat . with respect to te, we found that the hat superfamily was the most frequent class ii te found in close proximity to - and exclusively of - variable hpaii sites . however, neither the average distance to a repeat region, nor its size, differed significantly between variable and non-variable hpaii sites .

finally, we analysed whether genes harbouring variable hpaii sites were associated with tissue-specific differences in gene expression. as a control group, we included genes harbouring non-variable hpaii sites. these genes will subsequently be referred to a v-genes and n-genes. the rationale for comparing expression profiles between these groups was based on their differing methylation profiles across leaf and endosperm tissue; i.e. non-variable hpaii sites and their flanking regions were generally unmethylated in both tissues, while most variable sites showed tissue-specific differences in methylation. for each gene we extracted b <dig> transcription data of mixed seedling v <dig> stage and  <dig> dap endosperms   <cit> ). these particular developmental stages were comparable to those used for msap analysis. expression data was available for  <dig> n-genes and  <dig> v-genes and genes belonging to each group were further subdivided according to the relative methylation state of the hpaii site in leaf compared to endosperm, in addition to the genic location of the hpaii site . in all cases, the relative methylation states were predicted by comparing individual leaf and endosperm msap profiles as previously described .fig.  <dig> expression profiles of genes harbouring variable and non-variable hpaii sites. a transcription data of mixed seedling v <dig> stage  and  <dig> dap endosperms  from zm <dig> ; the dotted line represents the  <dig>  threshold value commonly used for presence of expression calling  <cit> ; l ~ e refers to genes that contained hpaii sites that were unmethylated  in either tissue, while l > e and l < e refer to hpaii sites that were more or less methylated in leaf relative to endosperm, respectively ; gene-body was defined as the region between transcriptional start and termination sites ; asterisks indicates significant differences in expression between leaf and endosperm tissues ; b

overall, we found that v-genes were expressed at higher levels in leaf - but not in endosperm tissue - relative to n-genes . furthermore, the majority of v-genes  showed significant  differences in expression between tissues compared to only 22% of n-genes . however, across tissue-types, we found no specific trend between methylation and expression. for example, of the seven v-genes that were more methylated within the gene-body in leaf compared to endosperm, two  showed increased levels of transcription in leaf relative to endosperm tissue, while four  showed the opposite profile . the same was true of variable hpaii sites located either within 2 kb of tss and tts, or within gene-bodies that were more methylated in endosperm relative to leaf. to validate those database-deduced transcriptional profiles by direct expression, we designed primers pairs that spanned the variable hpaii sites of msap fragments v <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig> that were located within grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig> and grmzm5g <dig> . we confirmed the expression profile of the two former - i.e. their increased levels of transcription in leaf relative to endosperm tissue in the b <dig> inbred line. however, v <dig> transcription differed from the expected expression profile, since this gene showed increased levels of transcription in endosperm relative to leaf . in addition to the b <dig> inbred line, we also analysed rna from mo <dig>  a69y and w <dig> inbred lines and found that gene-specific expression profiles were largely conserved across inbred lines . the only exception was grmzm2g <dig> that showed higher levels of expression in endosperm tissue from the a69y inbred line.

discussion
our results reveal that the bulk of methylation at hpaii sites  in leaf is conserved across maize individuals germinated from single-cob seeds of either inbred or hybrid maize lines. in leaves, only ~3% of msap fragments showed ii-mv, which is comparable – albeit slightly higher – to the less than 1% reported of individual arabidopsis seedling leaf tissue analysed by msap  <cit> . although we found no significant differences in the frequency of ii-mv between leaf and endosperm, the total number of variable msap fragments was increased four to fivefold of the latter. this finding is largely explained by the tight association between ii-mv and tdmrs and the fact that the latter are much more abundant in endosperm relative to leaf  <cit> . interestingly, a study of ii-mv across genetically identical mice also found that more than 50% of variable regions overlapped with tdmrs  <cit> .

as a consequence of the above, the bulk of variable msap fragments were more methylated in leaf relative to endosperm tissue. by contrast, most non-variable fragments were unmethylated; i.e. detected in both tissues. using publicly available wgbs data of maize leaf tissue  <cit> , we confirmed that non-variable hpaii sites lacked dna methylation, while most variable hpaii sites showed varying levels of cg methylation in genic regions, or cg and chg methylation in intergenic regions. furthermore, these particular methylation states were generally representative of extended genomic regions ranging from ~1–10 kb in size. taken together, the data suggest that ii-mv is preferentially associated with methylated dna regions. in accordance, a recent analysis of single-cell methylation variation in liver tissue from the japanese rice fish oryzias latipes found that methylation-variation was increased of hyper rather than hypomethylated dna regions  <cit> . importantly, the convergence between our msap methylation and previously generated wgbs from leaf tissue  <cit> , indicates that msap represents a reliable and representative read-out of methylation states. this suggests that msap represents a valuable alternative for analysing dna methylation states, either in plant species with incomplete or no genome information, or when the optimal sample size renders wgbs  not practical.

similar to variation in methylation between arabidopsis accessions and maize or soybean inbred lines , much ii-mv mapped within the gene-body and was largely restricted to cg methylation. a possible explanation for the absence and low levels of chg ii-mv is that such methylation is only present transiently during transcription due to increased in bonsai methylation  <dig>  activity, an h3k <dig> demethylase that actively prevents cmt3-mediated chg methylation within gene bodies  <cit> . importantly, in this msap study chg methylation was assayed in a ccg context and such methylation is largely met1-dependent as opposed to chg methylation in a ctg and cag context  <cit> . however, given that actively transcribed genes with a high density of ctg and cag are preferentially targeted for gene body methylation  <cit> , we cannot exclude that methylation in those sequence contexts may be more prone to chg ii-mv. akin to several other studies we found a complex relationship between gene-body methylation and expression across tissues  <cit> . indeed, a recent study shows that the lack of gene body methylation in the angiosperm eutrema salsugineum seemingly has no functional consequences with respect to transcription regulation  <cit> .

interestingly, a previous study of ii-mv across leaf tissue by msap showed that only a minority  of ii-mv was conserved between two leaf developmental stages  <cit> . such transient or stochastic ii-mv could have implications with regards to interpreting long-term effects of any particular stress on the epigenome or identifying epialleles generated across generations. indeed, stress responses to phosphate starvation, heat, cold, uv or hyperosmosis have been shown to be transient or heterogeneous, both across individuals and generations . it follows that differentially methylated regions  identified by studies performed on bulked tissues, or designed with a sub-optimal sample size, detect a combination of methylation variability that can be both transient and stable. this may be particularly relevant of low frequency demethylation events since such variation was less efficiently captured in a pooled sample by msap. at any rate, our data demonstrate that sample pooling can faithfully reflect at least a portion of methylation variation.

several studies in both plants and mammals have shown that tes exhibit both intra-individual and ii-mv  and there is ample evidence of methylation variation between and within genotypes resulting from proximity to tes . in this study, we analysed whether variable hpaii sites were in closer proximity to a te compared to non-variable sites. overall, we found no differences between these two groups, neither with respect to distance, nor size of the te. however, we did find that variable hpaii sites were preferentially located in vicinity of hat superfamily of class ii transposons. one obvious caveat of the present study is the comparatively small number of fragments yielded by the msap platform that showed ii-mv. nonetheless, analysis of ii-mv in mice by whole genome bisulfite sequencing revealed only a total of  <dig> loci that showed ii-mv. in that study, ~15% of variable regions were associated with endogenous retroviruses , a class i te. such data warrant further studies on the relevance of te on ii-mv following specific environmental or developmental stimuli.

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that ii-mv is largely restricted to tdmrs. importantly, we show that sample pooling is a methodologically appropriate design to study methylation variation in response to a given stimulus. additionally, comparative analyses to publicly available databases confirm that msap is an effective tool for dna methylation profiling when wgbs is not feasible, either due to lack of genomics/epigenomic data, or because of a large optimal sample size.
