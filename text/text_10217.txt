BACKGROUND
coffee tree, a member of the family rubiaceae, belongs to the genus coffea that comprises >  <dig> species. of these two species, the tetraploid coffea arabica l.  and the diploid c. canephora pierre ex a. froehner , are cultivated commercially. coffee, one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages, is consumed regularly by 40% of the world population mostly in the developed world  <cit> , and thus occupies a strategic position in the world socio-economy.

efforts undertaken globally to improve coffee, though successful, have proven to be too slow and severely constrained owing to various factors. the latter includes: genetic and physiological makeup , long generation cycle, requirement of huge land resources, and equally the dearth of easily accessible and assayable genetic tools/techniques for screening/selection. the situation warrants recourse to newer, easy, practical technologies that can provide acceleration, reliability and directionality to the breeding efforts, and allow characterization of cultivated/secondary genepool for proper utilization of the available germplasm in genetic improvement programs. in this context, development of dna marker tools and availability of markers-based molecular linkage maps becomes imperative for mas-based accelerated breeding of improved coffee genotypes.

among the different types of dna markers, the short sequence repeats  based microsatellite markers promise to be the most ideal ones due to their multi-allelic nature, high polymorphism content, locus specificity, reproducibility, inter-lab transferability and ease for automation  <cit> . microsatellite markers have been developed for a large number of plant species and are increasingly being used for ascertaining germplasm diversity, linkage analysis and molecular breeding  <cit> . despite these advantages, only ~ <dig> microsatellite markers have been reported till to date for coffee  <cit> , signifying the need for expanding the repertoire of these genetically highly informative markers for efficient management and improvement of coffee germplasm resources. here we report, a set of  <dig> novel microsatellite markers developed by radioactive screening of a small-insert partial genomic library of c. canephora . interestingly, all these markers exhibit broad cross-species transferability. we also demonstrate their utility as genetic markers for ascertaining the germplasm diversity, genotype individualization, linkage mapping and taxonomic affinities.

RESULTS
the present study aimed to isolate new coffee-specific informative ssrs useful as genetic markers for characterizing coffee genome and linkage mapping studies. for the purpose, a partial small-insert genomic library was constructed from a commercially cultivated robusta variety 'sln-274'. the library was screened using radioactive ssr oligo probes to isolate ssr-containing dna fragments, which were sequenced and used for designing primer pairs from the flanking regions and subsequent conversion to pcr-based ssr markers. the designed primer pairs were standardized for pcr amplification, and then validated for utility as genetic markers using panels of elite coffee genotypes, a mapping population for linkage studies, and related taxa of coffee for cross-species transferability. in addition, sequence data of the screened and putative ssr-positive selected clones were used to assess the relative abundance of different ssr motifs in robusta coffee genome. in total  <dig> new highly informative ssr markers are developed.

screening/identification of ssr positive genomic sequences from the small insert partial genomic library of sln-274
the small-insert partial genomic library constructed from robusta variety sln- <dig> comprised  <dig>  clones. radioactive screening of the arrayed and blotted clones indicated  <dig> putative positives of which good quality sequence data could be obtained for  <dig> clones. the average insert size of the sequenced clones was  <dig>  bp. considering the latter, and that the sequenced clones represented a random sample of the genomic library with respect to the size, the total size of the cloned genome amounted to  <dig>  mb which equaled to ca.  <dig>  % of the robusta coffee genome  <cit>  . ssr search of the clone sequences using the misa search module, detected  <dig> genuine ssr-positive clones  containing both targeted and non-targeted ssr motifs. overall, these clones contained  <dig> ssrs comprising dnrs , tnrs , and ho-nrs , and  <dig> ssrs comprising only mnrs  . among the targeted repeat motifs , ag was the most abundant repeat , followed by ac  and agc , whereas ccg  was the least abundant and act was not detected at all . similarly, among the non-targeted ssr motifs other than mnrs, at was the most abundant repeat .

frequency and distribution of ssrs in coffee genome
a total of  <dig> targeted ssrs  and  <dig> non-targeted dnrs were assessed for their lengths, distribution in the present library, and their relative abundance in the robusta genome . average length  for the dnrs and tnrs was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. among dnrs, at and ag were comparable and longer than ac, whereas acg and agc were the longest of the tnrs . the size of cloned/screened genomic library and the observed data for identified ssrs were considered along with the earlier predicted size of the robusta genome  <cit>  to derive relative estimates for frequency/distribution of different ssr motifs in the robusta genome. the analysis revealed coffee genome to be enriched in at type dnrs , which were estimated to be many fold more than any other ssr motifs . the results indicated one at-dnr per  <dig> kb  of robusta genome; this was almost 20-fold higher than the next most abundant dnr i.e. ag . the dnrs as a single class were estimated to be 1/ <dig> kb genome when at  was included, and 1/ <dig> kb coffee genome for the remaining ones. in comparison, the overall frequency of tnrs was calculated to be 1/ <dig> kb with agc being the most predominant  and ccg the least . in addition, a few other higher order ssrs  were also detected but these were not used for estimate calculations, as their numbers were very low. thus, the present study indicated an abundance of one ssr  per  <dig> kb of robusta coffee genome, wherein the dnrs were ~ <dig> times more abundant than the tnrs.

development of microsatellite markers
all the identified ssr-positive sequences were tried to design primer pairs for conversion to microsat markers using 'ssr motif length'  as one major criterion. as a result, only  <dig> of the total  <dig> identified ssrs  were found suitable for primer design indicating  <dig> % primer suitability. these comprised  <dig> % dnrs,  <dig> % compound ssrs,  <dig> % tnrs,  <dig> % ttnrs and  <dig> % hnrs. in addition, primers were also designed for  <dig> of the randomly chosen  <dig> mnrs to test their potential for conversion to ssr markers. among the ssrs found unsuitable for primer design,  <dig> % had shorter motif length and  <dig> % had flanking regions unsuitable for primer modeling. of the  <dig> potential primer pairs designed,  <dig> could be successfully amplified and  <dig> of these could further be validated  as useful markers indicating ~76% primer to marker conversion ratio.

validation of microsatellite markers for use in genetic studies
germplasm characterization
allelic diversity, heterozygosity status and extent of polymorphism
for ascertaining the useful attributes of genetic markers, all the new  <dig> microsatellite markers were tested on a panel of  <dig> elite robusta and arabica genotypes. good allelic amplification was obtained for all the markers across the tested genotypes, except for cam <dig> that did not give any amplification for the arabicas. in general, the new markers revealed low to medium allelic diversity, and notably  <dig> of them  resulted in double alleles in case of all the tested arabicas. overall, a maximum of six and seven alleles  with an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  alleles/marker were obtained for the tested markers of which  <dig> % and  <dig> % were polymorphic/informative forarabica and robusta genotypes respectively . seven markers  in the case of arabicas and four  for robustas were found to be monomorphic. the distribution of number of alleles amplified by each polymorphic marker  was highly skewed for arabica genotypes  in comparison with robustas  as seen in figure 1a.

the pic values varied considerably for the new markers across the tested genotypes. the mean pic value for arabicas was  <dig>  , which was significantly less than  <dig>   observed for robusta . further, the student's t test revealed highly significant differences in the total number of amplified alleles  and pic value estimates for arabica and robusta genotypes  for the amplified and comparable markers.

the above ssr allelic data, when used to calculate the heterozygosity estimates, revealed highly significant differences between the observed and expected heterozygosity both for arabicas  as well as for robustas . the results, thus, suggested significant heterozygote deficiency in both the germplasm sets. further, only  <dig> of the  <dig> pms  were found to be in hw equilibrium in the case of arabicas, while the remaining eight showed significant heterozygote deficiency  corroborating the heterozygosity data. similarly, in robustas,  <dig>  of the  <dig> pms were found to be in hw equilibrium and of the remaining  <dig> pms, eight markers showed significant heterozygote deficiency while six markers showed heterozygote excess.

the ld test performed for all the pms, showed  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  pair-wise comparisons in significant dis-equilibrium  for arabicas and robustas respectively. on an average each pm was found to be in dis-equilibrium with  <dig>   other pms in case of arabicas and  <dig>   for robustas. the maximum ld was observed for the marker cam <dig>  in arabicas and cam <dig>  in robustas.

discriminatory power  of novel ssr markers
the discriminatory power of all the new informative ssr markers for possible genotype individualization were inferred by calculating two types of the 'probability of identity'  estimates i.e. sib-based and unbiased considering the tested germplasm as related or unrelated, respectively. pi estimates obtained , show that the sib-based pi values for individual markers were around 10- <dig> for both the arabicas and robustas, whereas the unbiased pi estimates ranged from 10- <dig> – 10- <dig> for arabicas and 10- <dig> – 10- <dig> for robustas. in comparison, the cumulative pis indicating discriminatory power of the new markers were found to be manifold higher for the tested robusta genepool compared to arabicas. the sib-based cumulative pis calculated over  <dig>   <dig> and total number of most informative markers  were:  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> for arabicas, and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> for robustas. similarly, comparable unbiased cumulative pi estimates were:  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> for arabicas, and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> for robustas.

note: the markers are arranged as per their individual pi in the decreasing order; cumulative power of discrimination was calculated using products of pis of successive informative markers arranged in decreasing order as described by waits et al.  <cit> . the pi was not estimated for dl and mm markers, as they were uninformative. dl: duplicated loci; mm: monomorphic markers.

mappability of novel ssr markers
the new ssr markers were tested for their mappability on robusta linkage map. in total,  <dig> of the  <dig> new markers  were found to be polymorphic for the parents of the robusta pseudo-testcross mapping population i.e. cxr and kagganahalla. the nine markers  could be mapped on the robusta linkage map developed by us  <cit> . notably, seven of the markers  were mapped on independent lgs, which indicated the new markers to be randomly distributed on the robusta genome .

cross-species/-genera transferability and primer conservance
cross species transferability of the new robusta derived ssr-markers was tested for  <dig> related coffea and two psilanthus species. in general, the markers resulted in robust cross-species amplifications with alleles of comparable sizes in the tested taxa . overall, an average transferability of ~92% was observed , which was higher for coffea spp.  than for the related psilanthus spp. . moreover, within different coffea taxa, across its different botanical subsections, the transferability was comparable . the data thus, indicated a very high marker conservance across the related coffee species, which was calculated to be ~91% over all the tested markers. marker cam <dig> exhibited lowest conservance of 23%  and 27% , whereas  <dig> markers were found to be 100% conserved. the data also revealed the presence of some private alleles , which possibly could be species-specific. in total,  <dig> such alleles were found in coffea  and  <dig> in psilanthus species , over all the  <dig> markers. these accounted for ~34% of amplified alleles in coffea spp. and 45% of those amplified in psilanthus spp.

+/-: indicates 'amplification'/'no amplification' and are given a weightage of  <dig> and  <dig> for transferability/conservence calculations respectively; tmark: marker transferability over all the taxa; ctaxa: marker conservance over all the taxa; tmark-taxa: marker transferability of all the markers over all the taxa; ctaxa-mark: primer conservance across all the taxa over all the markers.

generic affinities within/between cultivated and wild coffee germplasm
the diploid microsatellite data were examined for their potential in genetic diversity studies by studying the variation and interrelationship between the cultivated as well as wild genepool. the average genetic distance values  were found to be  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   for the tested arabicas, robustas and over both the sets, respectively. similar estimates calculated for different coffea and psilanthus species were:  <dig>   for erythrocoffea ,  <dig>   for erythrocoffea ,  <dig>   for mozambicoffea,  <dig>   for pachycoffea,  <dig>   for paracoffea, and  <dig>   over all the compared species.

the nj phenetic tree generated using the genetic distance estimates for eight genotypes each from arabica and robusta clearly resolved the tested germplasm in two distinct clusters, one representing all the tetraploid arabicas, while the other comprised all the diploid robustagenotypes  with significant branch support. the selections from pure arabicas formed a single cluster within arabicas, whereas selections from hybrids formed different group. hdet was found closest to s <dig> and s <dig>  whereas sln <dig> was found to be the most distant entry in arabicas. similarly, a clustering analysis of  <dig> related species  along with two genotypes each from c. arabica and c. canephora formed coherent clusters of diploid erythrocoffeas , tetraploid erythrocoffea , mozambicoffea , and pachycoffea . a single entry for melanocoffea represented by c. stenophylla was the most divergent among the coffea species and showed proximity with entries from paracoffea section .

discussion
distribution and abundance of detected ssr motifs
the coffee-specific ssr markers described in this study were developed using the conventional approach of construction/screening of a partial small-insert genomic library. the success rate of any microsatellite development effort is indicated by the proportion of ssr-containing clones in the library followed by number of detected ssrs, qualities of ssr motifs and also by the quality of flanking regions. in the present study,  <dig> good quality ssr-positive clones containing a total of  <dig> ssrs were obtained from which  <dig> ssr markers were developed . the results, thus, suggested a success rate of  <dig> % in the identification of potential target ssr-positive clones, and  <dig> % in overall marker development. in a representative study to assess success of conventional library screening approach for microsat marker development in  <dig> different plant genera, it was found that the proportion of ssr-positive clones varied significantly  from species to species  <cit> . the observed ssr detection efficiency of the approach in this study was comparable with earlier reports in acasia  and peanut , but was higher than rice , potato,  and wheat , and less than white spruce .

the estimates derived from this study revealed that the relative distribution of different ssrs in robusta coffee genome is relatively poor in overall ssr abundance  compared to various other plant species such as arabidopsis, rice, barley   <cit>  and mulberry . nevertheless, the relative frequency, repeat lengths, and distribution pattern of different types of genomic ssrs in coffee genome  were comparable to those reported in a number of plant species like apple  <cit> , avacado  <cit> , birch  <cit> , peach  <cit> , acasia  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . in specific, ag was detected in higher proportion  than ac; ag repeat cores were, in general, found to be longer than any other ssr type. repeat cores of tnrs were, in general, smaller than dnrs, and at  was found to be the most abundant in comparison to any other dnr or tnr. in comparison, the at-rich tnrs in the coffee genome were found to be relatively less abundant than seen in most plant species  <cit> , but comparable to some of the tree species like avacado  and peach . a species specific-pattern of tnr abundance has also been demonstrated in closely related species like rice and wheat that belong to the same family but differ significantly in their genomic tnr content  <cit> . some of the variation seen in the ssr estimates  as discussed above across different studies including the present one on coffee, can be ascribed to the differences in criteria used for ssr search viz., minimum length of repeat-core, the size of the genomic library screened, screening stringency, oligos used for screening and ssr mining tools, notwithstanding the innate differences in genomic organization of ssrs in different species.

a comparison of the relative abundance/distribution of genomic ssrs with that of genic-ssrs developed from coffee transcriptome earlier by us  <cit> , revealed two striking differences viz., an apparent higher abundance of ssrs in the transcriptome  and a near reverse pattern of tnr abundance/relative distribution in two types of ssrs. importantly, the two most abundant tnrs  in the genic-ssrs were least abundant or not-detected in the genomic ssrs. the observation would suggest interesting possibilities of differential distribution/organization of tnrs as well as restriction sites for the enzymes used for library construction across gene-rich and gene-deficient regions of the coffee genome. however, such possibilities can only be addressed by further detailed genomic studies in times to come.

development of new ssr markers
in coffee, to the best of our knowledge till date only ca.  <dig> genomic ssrs have been described in literature  <cit>  warranting continuous efforts to develop additional new markers to expand the existing repertoire for their efficient deployment in genetic studies in coffee. in this study 63% of the detected ssrs were found useful for primer design/marker conversion, a much higher success rate compared to that reported for apple , cassava , elymus caninus , oat  <dig> %  <cit>  and potato . the two main sequence attributes that rendered  <dig> identified ssrs unsuitable for primer design were found to be: a shorter repeat core, and a low-complexity flanking region  unsuitable for primer modeling. interestingly, in the present study, not even a single failure was due to the location of ssr-core towards the end of clone sequence, which is reported to be one major limiting factor in many earlier studies in cassava, tomato, oat and fir  <cit> . the higher success rate and less number of limiting factors in primer-designing observed in this study are expected to be due to the better suitability of the restriction enzymes, as well as, the relatively longer genomic fragments  used for the genomic library construction. importance of size of the genomic fragments used for construction of genomic library/ssr-marker development has also been shown earlier in groundnut  <cit> .

the proportion of designed primers successfully producing amplification products gives a primer-to-marker conversion ratio and indicates the ultimate success of the library construction effort. in this study, of the  <dig> primer pairs designed,  <dig> could be validated as efficient ssr-markers  thus resulting in ~ <dig> % primer-to-marker conversion ratio, broadly comparable to many earlier conventional genomic library-based studies viz., cucurbits  <cit> , elymus  <cit> , peanut  <cit> , tomato,  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . one of the lowest primer-to-marker convertibility reported for douglas fir  was suggested to be due to the complexity unique to the conifer genomes  <cit> . further, a survey of the literature suggests, in general, a higher conversion ratios for small genomes like apple, peach, and a negative correlation between the genome size and the amplification efficiency of ssr primers due to mechanistic reasons  <cit> .

two of the  <dig> new ssr markers described here  were based on mnr repeats. in general, these markers warranted much more critical appraisal for ascertaining their individual alleles/sizing that in many cases were not easily distinguishable from the similar sized confounding stutter amplicons . therefore, it may be prudent to avoid use of such mnr-based markers despite these being informative, unless no other markers are available.

utility of new ssrs as genetic markers
till date, there are a few studies describing development of coffee-specific ssr markers  <cit> ; however, only a few of these provide data for the utility of new ssrs in genetic studies  <cit> . therefore, one major aim of the present study was to test the potential of the new markers reported here for their use in studies related to genetic diversity in cultivated coffee germplasm, linkage mapping, constructing reference panels/bar codes for individualization of genotypes, cross-species transferability, and taxonomic relationship in related taxa.

germplasm characterization
level of allelic polymorphism and genetic diversity
various genetic parameters viz., allelic diversity, pic, ho, he, kurtosis/skewness, hwe, ld, calculated for all the new ssrs amply demonstrated their utility as genetic markers . in general, the markers revealed low to moderate allelic/genetic diversity which was comparable and in some cases more than that reported for the earlier described coffee genomic ssrs  <cit> , and as expected, invariably higher than the genic-ssrs  <cit> . the total number of alleles amplified by different markers in the tested arabicas and robustas was almost similar; however, the markers were found significantly more informative with higher pic values for robustas. in addition, it was important to note that  <dig> of the tested markers amplified two distinct but similar sized alleles across all the tested arabicas suggesting these to be the result of duplicated fixed loci in the arabica genome. the above observations are likely considering the reproductive behavior, genome evolution and domestication process of two types of coffee. the robustas are expected to be genetically more diverse  due to their out-crossing behavior in contrast to arabicas that are self-compatible and also known to suffer from narrow genetic base resulting from the genetic bottleneck during domestication process  <cit> . similarly, the duplicate loci in arabica genome are plausible as it is an allotetraploid resulted from hybridization of two homeologous diploid genomes  followed by diploidization and stabilization  <cit> .

different genetic parameters/tests such as ho, he, ld, hwe are important indicators of origin, evolution and distribution of diversity in the available genepool. the heterozygosity measures  for the new ssr markers indicated significant heterozygote decay  in the tested germplasm. kurtosis/skewness parameters indicated that the allelic diversity for the new ssrs does not follow normal distribution. similarly, the hwe and ld analysis of the polymorphic markers  revealed only about 2/3rd of the markers  in hw equilibrium and about 25– <dig> % markers showing significant ld in the analyzed arabicas and robustas. these results are in agreement with our earlier observations with genomic as well as genic-ssrs  <cit> , and indeed reflective of the genetic composition and mating behavior of the tested materials. overall, these studies indicated that the tested robusta germplasm comprised allogamous, relatively unrelated genotypes , while autogamous arabicas comprised mostly of hybrid varieties/selections with overlapping/shared pedigrees. the results thus suggest the suitability of the new markers for reliably ascertaining genetic diversity in the coffee genepool.

discriminatory power of new ssr markers
individualization of plant germplasm resources has become important in the present day scenario for their proper management and utilization, as well as ipr protection which can be achieved by dna typing techniques involving use of highly polymorphic markers like ssrs. germplasm characterization using such typing approaches remains a costly proposition, especially if the target species like coffee that has very limited diversity in its available genepool. to circumvent these problems and increase the utility of such efforts, it has been proposed to build reference dna polymorphism data resources/panels for coffee germplasm using robust markers like ssrs and common experimental guidelines  <cit> . such reference resource can then readily be used for coffee genotype individualization, germplasm selection for breeding/improvement, and germplasm exchange in international collaborations  <cit> . in this context, it becomes important to ascertain the pi estimates  of the ssr markers, before deployment in germplasm characterization studies. in general, the pi estimates for the new markers ranged from low to moderate when considered individually, but were highly informative for genotype discrimination when tested together .

moreover, the estimates were found to be reflective of the diversity status in the test germplasm, and accordingly were significantly different  for arabicas than the robustas . the analysis in general indicated the need for use of 3– <dig> times more markers to achieve the comparable level of discrimination in the two coffee genepools. moreover, the data suggested that from practical point of view it might be prudent to calculate the sib-based pi  for deciding the number of markers that can provide sufficient variability for individualization of the test germplasm. this is expected as the sib-based pi discounts the possible similarities/relatedness in the target germplasm arising due to overlapping pedigrees/common parentage.

mappability of the new ssr markers
one of the major potential utilities of dna markers is their use as robust genomic landmarks on the linkage groups that can subsequently be tagged to the gene controlling important traits of interest providing possibilities of mas-based breeding. this requires generation of reasonably dense linkage maps populated with large number of revisitable dna markers for which the ssrs remain the most desired ones. till date, very few ssrs are mapped on the robusta linkage map  <cit>  warranting extensive efforts to generate more ssr markers usable for linkage analysis. in this regard, we tested the suitability of the new markers for linkage mapping using a pseudo-testcross mapping population of robusta coffee. significantly,  <dig> % of the markers were found to be polymorphic for the parents of the mapping population, and all of these could be successfully mapped . the mapped markers were distributed on different linkage groups, and some of these mapped towards the ends of the lgs as has been seen in the earlier studies  <cit> . the data, thus, strongly demonstrate that the new markers can be efficiently used for genetic linkage studies in coffee.

cross-species/-generic transferability
the low-moderate level of diversity exhibited by the new markers in the cultivated coffee genepool, is more than compensated by their high potential for cross-species transferability. all the markers revealed robust cross-species/-generic amplifications with alleles of comparable sizes when tested for  <dig> coffea and two psilanthus taxa . the data revealed that the markers described here show much better taxa transferability than the earlier published genomic ssr markers  <cit> , but relatively less than the genic ssr markers reported by us  <cit> . more importantly, the markers showed comparable transferability across related species of coffea as well as  <dig> species of the related genus psilanthus. this is significant as successful cross-species amplification is generally restricted to related species within a genus and reduces when tested for different genera  <cit> . further, it was interesting to note that all the new ssrs that were monomorphic/uninformative for the tested arabica and robusta germplasm, exhibited considerable polymorphism across the tested related taxa. the only exception was the marker cam <dig> that showed a very low conservance even across the coffea spp. thus, the new ssr markers described here strengthen the possibility of their use as conserved orthologous sets  for genetic characterization of different related wild coffee taxa, and also for coffee taxonomic/synteny studies.

diversity analysis and genetic relatedness within/between coffea and psilanthus species
the genomic ssrs described in this study, despite revealing low level of polymorphism, were able to group all the  <dig> genotypes belonging to two cultivated germplasms in phenetic clustering that were indicative of species relationship and confirming their known pedigrees . for example, the analysis confirmed the related origin of s <dig> and s <dig>  which are two-way hybrids between hdet and taferikela.

similarly, the analysis of  <dig> representative samples belonging to  <dig> coffea and two psilanthus species, revealed generic affinities that were in general agreement with their known taxonomic relationships, based on their geographical distribution as well as chevalier's botanical classification  <cit>  . accordingly, the phenetic tree based on the new markers data very clearly grouped the analyzed related coffee species as per their respective botanical sub-sections . importantly, the analysis distinctly separated the two paracoffea species  from all the other coffea spp. these results are similar to the earlier published studies undertaken to ascertain species relationships using ssrs  <cit> , as well as other marker approaches  <cit> . a close relationship of c. kapakata to the mozambicoffea taxa, and status of the only melanocoffea taxon c. stenophylla as seen here was also indicated earlier in the est-ssr and issr-based studies  <cit> . these results, thus, demonstrate that the new ssr markers developed in the present study can be highly informative in exploring the taxonomic relationship of coffee species complex.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study describes  <dig> new microsatellite markers developed using the conventional approach of construction/screening of partial small-insert genomic library. the approach was found to be successful but difficult and experiment-intensive with low success rate of ~ <dig> %. analysis of the identified ssr-positive genomic clones provided insights into the relative abundance, and distribution pattern of different ssr motifs in the coffee genome that was found to be relatively poor in its ssr abundance compared to many other plant genomes. overall, the dnrs were much more abundant than tnrs, and among different types of ssr motifs, at was the most abundant followed by ag, ac, and acg. the tnr ccg, was the least abundant. more than 50% of the identified ssrs could be converted to usable markers resulting in a high primer-to-marker conversion ratio. all the  <dig> markers were found to be polymorphic in the tested coffee/related germplasm and their utility as efficient genetic markers could be demonstrated for diversity analysis, germplasm individualization, linkage mapping, cross-species transferability and taxonomic studies. this study has thus enriched the available small repertoire of coffee ssr markers by  <dig> new ssrs, which are not only useful for cultivated coffee but are also expected to be equally useful for genetic studies involving related species that constitute the important secondary genepool for improvement of coffee.
