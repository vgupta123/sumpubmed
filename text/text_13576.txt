BACKGROUND
world demand for fuel, currently supplied mainly in the form of non-renewable fossil fuel, is continuously rising, leading to an increased interest in alternative and sustainable energy sources. biodiesel derived from microalgae has opened up a new, promising path to solve the energy crisis  <cit> . compared with oil-producing plants, the most attractive advantage of microalgae is their high oil production capacity; the annual oil yield per hectare is  <dig> times higher than that of oil seed crops  <cit> . however, to meet industrial scale requirements, the cost of biofuel production must be further reduced  <cit> . one promising strategy is to apply technologies developed in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. however, this approach requires an oleaginous algal model with high oil production capacity, known genetic information, and established methods for molecular manipulation.

chlorella protothecoides sp.  <dig>  is a unicellular green alga with great potential for biodiesel production. it has been proposed as one of the best candidates for commercial manufacture of microalgae-derived biofuel  <cit> . one special characteristic that distinguishes cp <dig> from many other algae is its ability to not only live autotrophically through photosynthesis but also to grow heterotrophically by using extracellular organic carbon sources such as glucose . furthermore, when the organism switches from autotrophism to heterotrophism, the chloroplast disappears and is replaced by lipid bodies, leading to high oil accumulation  <cit> . based on this finding, a photosynthesis fermentation approach  was developed to cultivate cp <dig>  this approach combines autotrophic and heterotrophic growth, resulting in 69% higher oil yield and  <dig> % less co <dig> emission compared with typical heterotrophic cultivation  <cit> . in addition, alternative carbon sources and the combination of different cultivation approaches have been applied to further reduce the cost and to boost biomass/lipid production . despite all of this progress in recent years, both the genome sequence of cp <dig> and the platform for molecular manipulations are still missing.

in the present study, we generated the whole-genome sequence of cp <dig> using multiple strategies, and built a de novo assembly, which demonstrated that this alga has a small genome that encodes the lowest number of genes among all sequenced green microalgae. the cp <dig> genome was annotated and characterized by comparative genomic analysis. in addition, to investigate the differences between autotrophic and heterotrophic cells in metabolic pathways and related regulation patterns, differential expression of mrna and proteins in the two cell types were studied and a potential regulatory pathway that could result in accumulation of oil in heterotrophically growing cp <dig> was identified. together, the genome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses presented in this study yield new insights into the molecular basis for the accumulation of oil and provide a rich resource of genetic information that will be useful for the development of cp <dig> as an oleaginous model microalga.

RESULTS
genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation
a whole-genome shotgun strategy was adapted to sequence the genome of cp <dig> using both roche and illumina technologies. a total of  <dig>  gbp of clean data, representing 159-fold coverage of the estimated genome was used for assembly, producing a genome assembly with scaffold l <dig> of  <dig>  nucleotides  and contig l <dig> of  <dig>  nts . the size of the assembled cp <dig> genome was estimated to be  <dig>  mbp. pulse field gel electrophoresis revealed at least six discrete bands ranging from  <dig> kbp to  <dig>  kbp , suggesting at least six different-sized chromosomes.table  <dig>

to assess genome coverage and completeness of the whole genome, we also estimated the genome size for cp <dig> utilizing 17-base k-mers and their poisson distribution in the sequencing reads  <cit> . the estimated cp <dig> genome size was  <dig>  mbp . considering the presence of sequencing errors, the sequencing depth is expected to be underestimated and, consequently, the cp <dig> genome size should be smaller than  <dig>  mbp. using this estimated genome size, the assembled contigs and scaffolds should at least cover about 80% and 83% of the whole genome, respectively. further, the completeness of the genome was assessed using cegma v <dig>   based on mapping of the  <dig> most highly conserved core eukaryotic genes   <cit> . the completeness of the assembled genome was  <dig> % .

overall, the nuclear genome was 63% g/c , which is similar to chlamydomonas reinhardtii  but slightly lower than chlorella variabilis nc64a  and higher than coccomyxa subellipsoidea c- <dig> . the cp <dig> genomic sequence was repeat poor, with only about  <dig> % of the genome composed of repetitive sequences, making it the trebouxiophyceae genome with the fewest repeats . known transposon-derived repetitive sequences accounted for less than  <dig> % of the genome, with ltr retrotransposons, non-ltr retrotransposons, and dna transposons making up  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the genome, respectively .table  <dig>

a number of methods were used to predict genes, including homology-based methods and de novo gene prediction . these results were then integrated to generate a consensus gene set. in addition, the transcription information from rna-seq was incorporated, resulting in a total of  <dig>  genes in the genome. of the  <dig>  predicted genes,  <dig>   were transcribed in either autotrophic or heterotrophic growing cells and  <dig>   genes could be functionally annotated by homology search against multiple protein databases , including trembl, swissprot, kegg, interpro, and gene ontology . the  <dig>  genes annotated by go were classified as encoding cellular components, proteins with molecular functions, or proteins involved in biological processes. the most abundant genes in the “molecular function” category were binding and catalytic genes. in the “biological processes” category, genes involved in cellular and metabolic processes were most abundant. no obvious enrichment or depletion of genes in specific go groups was found in comparison with c. variabilis nc64a and c. subellipsoidea c- <dig> .figure  <dig>

genome characterization
comparative genomics
c. protothecoides is a member of the class trebouxiophyceae in the phylum chlorophyta. presently, only two strains in the trebouxiophyceae, c. variabilis nc64a  <cit>  and c. subellipsoidea c- <dig>  <cit> , have been fully sequenced. to gain insight into the novel features of the cp <dig> genome, we compared it with not only these two strains, but also several other sequenced chlorophytes , including two in the chlorophyceae  and two in the mamiellophyceae .

the size of the genome was regarded as a consequence of evolution  <cit> , as evolutionarily related species usually have similar genome size. accordingly, m. pusilla ccmp <dig> and o. tauri, two ancient green algae belonging to the prasinophyceae  <cit> , have the smallest genomes, at  <dig> mbp and  <dig> mbp, respectively. in fact, of the available algal genome sequences, all members of the prasinophyceae contain genomes that range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> mbp  <cit> . on the other hand, among the five sequenced chlorophytes, genome sizes range from  <dig> mbp  to as large as  <dig> mbp , and the model green alga c. reinhardtii has a  <dig> mbp genome. these values are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in genome size correlate with the evolutionary position of related species. surprisingly, though, the size of the cp <dig> genome is only  <dig>  mbp, making it the smallest genome reported so far in the sequenced chlorophytes, and falling in the range of the prasinophytes. c. variabilis nc64a and c. subellipsoidea c- <dig>  the two closest relatives, have genomes that are double this size, suggesting that a dramatic change in the size of the genome happened after the diversification of these algae.

the unexpectedly small size of the cp <dig> genome led us to reconsider its origin and its evolutionary relationship with other chlorella species. therefore, we analyzed its coding proteins by comparing them with the trembl protein database. the total number of best-hit proteins from all organisms was counted and is shown in figure 1b. the result indicated that the majority of proteins encoded in the cp <dig> genome possess best-hit homologs in c. variabilis nc64a, and these account for 64% of the total proteins. only  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins had best-hit homologs in v. carteri and c. reinhardtii, respectively. in addition, although the average g/c content of cp <dig> was slightly lower than that of c. variabilis nc <dig>  both genomes had g/c content greater than 60% , consistent with the high g/c feature in the genomes of chlorella. furthermore, using  <dig> single-copy orthologues among the seven green algae, we built a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree that indicated that c. variabilis nc64a is the closest relative of cp <dig> . finally, we compared the gene families among the three closest species . as shown in figure 1d, of the  <dig>  gene families in cp <dig>  nearly 50%  are shared with c. variabilis nc64a and c. subellipsoidea c- <dig>  there are  <dig>  shared gene families between cp <dig> and c. variabilis nc64a, which account for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total gene families, respectively. further comparison with the model alga c. reinhardtii identified a large number of unique genes  in this species, suggesting a more distant relationship between c. reinhardtii and the other three green algae . together, these results confirmed the evolutionary proximity of cp <dig> and c. variabilis nc64a.

given that cp <dig> is a member of chlorella, we then asked what kind of genomic features could have led to the drastically reduced genome size. as a first possibility, repetitive sequences are usually a big contributor to genome size, and this is especially true in plants  <cit> . repeat analysis indicated that cp <dig> did, in fact, contain very few repetitive sequences, which altogether only accounted for  <dig> % of the whole genome . however, comparing this percentage with c. variabilis nc64a and c. subellipsoidea c- <dig>  in which repeated sequences represent  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genome, respectively, the reduced number of repetitive sequences would not be expected to result in the over 50% reduction in genome size between these species. therefore, we proceeded to analyze the number of protein-coding genes in the three algae. as mentioned above, the total number of predicted genes in cp <dig> was only  <dig> , which is substantially less than the nearly  <dig>  genes predicted in the other two species. further, we compared the genes among the three algae and clustered each of them into four categories : core orthologues , pairwise orthologues, homologs, and unique genes. we found that core orthologues, pairwise orthologues, and homologous genes were only slightly decreased in cp0710; however, the number of genes in the n:n:n orthologues were greatly reduced . since the n:n:n orthologues represent the number of duplicated genes in the organism, this result indicated that the core set of genes within the three algae is similar but in the cp <dig> genome, the copy number of each gene is reduced. meanwhile, the number of unique genes also differed greatly between cp <dig> and the others. there were only  <dig>  genes present in the cp <dig> genome, compared with  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique genes in the other two species. this could presumably result in a significant decrease in genome size. furthermore, we performed a whole-genome alignment of cp <dig> and c. variabilis nc64a. the aligned gapless segments with the same order and orientation in both species were ligated into a “chain” to generate the synteny map shown in figure 2b. this analysis demonstrated that multiple copy syntenic regions were present in the c. variabilis nc64a genome. for example, four large regions  and several small regions  in the c. variabilis genome were similar to segment  <dig> in cp <dig>  suggesting genome duplication/rearrangement happened at this location. therefore, through the different analyses described above, it can be concluded that the reduced gene numbers , including fewer unique genes and the lack of the genome duplication/rearrangement seen in c. variabilis, may, collectively, contribute to the smaller genome size of cp <dig> figure  <dig>

nitrogen transport and assimilation
in plants, both carbon  and nitrogen  are crucial for many fundamental cellular activities, and are required not only as nutrients but also as environmental signals to control metabolism and cellular responses  <cit> . different organisms have their own preferred n sources, and there are different transporters and assimilation systems involved. for cp <dig>  we showed in an earlier study that it prefers ammonium and amino acids as nitrogen sources, and it has lost the ability to grow on nitrate- or urea-containing medium. we also identified and characterized one ammonium transporter gene   <cit> . to further our understanding of the nitrogen preference of cp <dig>  a survey of proteins involved in nitrogen transport and assimilation in the cp <dig> genome was performed, leading to the identification of  <dig> genes . not surprisingly, both the nitrate and the urea transporter were missing from the cp <dig> genome but were present in other green algae. meanwhile, three nitrogen-related transporters  were identified, consistent with our findings on the choice of nitrogen sources in cp <dig>  as described previously  <cit> .

the ornithine-urea cycle , a metabolic pathway that is important for detoxification of excessive ammonia in animals  <cit> , is absent from green plants and algae, though it was recently identified in diatoms  <cit> . similarly, the cp <dig> genome does not encode the requisite proteins for a complete ouc; it has lost two of the key enzymes: arginase, which catalyzes the conversion of arginine to ornithine and urea, and urease, which breaks down urea to produce ammonia. however, cp <dig> has all the genes necessary for the aspartate-argininosuccinate shunt, which connects the ouc and tricarboxylic acid  cycles and is well-established in animal cells  <cit> . recently, a similar connection was also found in diatoms, which included not only ouc and tca cycles, but also the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle, although the biological function of this coupling in these photosynthetic microalgae are still not clear  <cit> . the presence of these genes suggested a conserved pathway might also exist in cp <dig>  to further support this hypothesis, we also identified the nitrogen regulatory protein pii and glutamate synthase, two key components in regulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . nitrogen regulatory protein pii is a sensor of 2-oxoglutarate and atp, while glutamate synthase catalyzes glutamate synthesis from 2-oxoglutarate. both of these link the tca cycle and nitrogen assimilation through 2-oxoglutarate, and thus control the flow of carbon and nitrogen.

the linkage between carbon and nitrogen metabolism might be especially important in cp <dig>  since the interchange between autotrophic and heterotrophic growth is achieved through the availability of c and n sources . high nitrogen supplementation in the media will block the ability of the cells to switch from autotrophic to heterotrophic growth, as indicated by persistent chlorophyll, regardless of the presence or absence of organic carbon sources. future study will focus on understanding how the carbon and nitrogen signal is detected and transferred, and whether and/or how this signal will directly contribute to the high oil content in cp <dig> 

carbohydrate transporters
to utilize glucose from the heterotrophic medium, cp <dig> must be able to actively transport the sugar into cells. this task is normally carried out by h+/hexose co-transporters . in chlorella kessleri, a species which is also capable of using glucose to support cell growth, three h+/hexose co-transporter genes  have been identified  <cit> . therefore, we performed homologous search using the hups from c. kessleri as queries, and identified homologs in all seven green algae species . however, the number of homologous proteins among these algae was different. they were most abundant in c. subellipsoidea c- <dig> , and  <dig> proteins were identified in cp <dig> 

to evaluate the evolutionary relationship of the hups, a phylogenetic tree was generated . the homologs of h+/hexose co-transporters were categorized into three classes, of which two were common in green algae. interestingly, the third class, which includes the three hup proteins, was only present in the three chlorella species and the other related alga c. subellipsoidea c- <dig>  this result illustrated that these hups were restricted to chlorella, suggesting that the inability of other green algae to utilize glucose might be due to the absence of these proteins. in addition, hydrophobicity analysis of the three hup-like proteins  indicated that each of them contained  <dig> transmembrane domains, similar to the prototypical hup proteins in c. kessleri
 <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that six conserved amino acid residues are responsible for hexose recognition  <cit> , and we found that all of them are conserved in the hup-like proteins in cp <dig> . therefore, our data suggested that the three identified hup-like proteins might be responsible for the ability of cp <dig> to rapidly utilize glucose under heterotrophic conditions. studies on these glucose transporters are being actively pursued.

transcriptomes and proteomes under autotrophic and heterotrophic growth conditions
to dissect the potential mechanisms underlying the highly elevated oil accumulation in heterotrophic cells, the transcriptomes and proteomes of cells under the two growth conditions were analyzed. a total of  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m clean reads were obtained from rna-seq in autotrophic and heterotrophic samples, with  <dig> % and  <dig> % mapping ratios to the genome, respectively . overall,  <dig> % of the genes were expressed differently during heterotrophic growth, with  <dig> over-expressed and  <dig>  downregulated . in addition, through one dimension protein separation followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we identified a total of  <dig>  proteins . among these,  <dig> proteins had peptide spectrum matching  ≥  <dig>  and these were used for the subsequent differential expression analysis. compared with the autotrophic cells, in heterotrophic cells,  <dig> proteins were upregulated while  <dig> proteins were downregulated. in addition, comparison between the proteomic and transcriptomic data indicated that the two datasets largely agreed with each other , despite the fact that fewer genes were identified in the proteomic study, demonstrating the reliability of both methodologies.

next, we performed functional annotation and pathway analysis of the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes using kegg pathway annotation . red and green lines indicate that the genes involved in the pathways are either upregulated or downregulated, respectively. blue lines represent pathways with no significant changes between the two types of cells. as shown in figure 3a, this analysis identified several pathways that were enriched for either upregulated or downregulated genes. zooming in on the pathways, we found that all of the differentially expressed genes could be classified into one of nine clusters , and the most affected processes were the ones involved in carbohydrate, energy, and lipid metabolism as shown in figure 3b. in addition, similar analysis was performed based on go annotation, which revealed a similar pattern .figure  <dig>

compared with autotrophic cells, the strongly upregulated genes in heterotrophic cells are involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the tca cycle, pyruvate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid biosynthesis . this result is not unexpected, since the increase in glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and the tca cycle could result in the rapid accumulation of atp and other important precursors such as acetyl-coa, which are critical for fatty acid synthesis in heterotrophic algae. in addition, the pentose phosphate pathway is another significantly upregulated process. this pathway is important for glucose consumption coupled with nadph generation, and the latter is necessary for fatty acid synthesis. furthermore, energy metabolism shifts dramatically from photophosphorylation to oxidative phosphorylation under heterotrophic conditions, suggesting a high demand for energy, presumably for rapid cell growth and lipid accumulation. overall, all of the upregulated pathways can directly or indirectly enhance the accumulation of fatty acids in heterotrophic algae.

on the other hand, there were a few pathways that were dramatically downregulated. these pathways included photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and carotenoid biosynthesis . downregulation of photosynthesis under heterotrophic growth conditions is to be expected, since the availability of glucose in the medium will allow the algae to stop using photosynthesis to obtain organic carbon. more importantly, the elimination of chloroplasts, which usually occupy a large volume in autotrophic cells, will presumably provide a lot of space for the accumulation of lipid bodies in heterotrophic cells . in addition, genes involved in fatty acid degradation are uniformly downregulated , which presumably may allow the cells to keep the fatty acids in the form of triacylglycerol as an energy reserve, making this alga optimized for lipid production.furthermore, we integrated the proteomic and transcriptomic data into the metabolic pathways for glucose utilization and fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis under heterotrophic growth conditions. as shown in figure 4a and 4b, the proteomic data largely agree with the transcriptomic results, in which a majority of the enzymes in these pathways are highly expressed. for some key enzymes, such as fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphate aldolase , which catalyzes the conversion of fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, the protein level increased over  <dig> times. in addition, both rna and protein levels of the major lipid droplet protein  were boosted, consistent with the accumulation of lipid droplets in heterotrophic cells.figure  <dig>

discussion
cp <dig> is a green alga capable of growing both autotrophically and heterotrophically, and accumulating large amounts of lipid within the cells under heterotrophic growth conditions. this phenotype implies that a specific mechanism, though still elusive, may be encoded in its genome. here, we generated the first draft of the genome sequence of cp <dig>  and also analyzed the transcriptomes and proteomes for cells growing under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. one of the biggest surprises resulting from our analyses was that cp <dig> contains a very small nuclear genome, about half the size of the c. variabilis nc64a or c. subellipsoidea c- <dig> genome. the high degree of similarity of the proteins of cp <dig> and c. variabilis nc64a indicates that the two algae are evolutionarily related, and that cp <dig> is a bona fide species of chlorella. meanwhile, several possible reasons for the smaller genome in cp <dig> were considered, including fewer encoded genes, fewer copies of orthologues, and fewer genome duplications and rearrangements .

another interesting finding after analyzing the cp <dig> genome was the lack of both nitrate and urea transporters, while other nitrogen-related transporters were present, including nitrite, ammonium, and amino acid transporters. this result was not a surprise to us since our previous study showed that this alga could not grow in medium using nitrate or urea as nitrogen sources  <cit> ; however, no other green alga sequenced so far has lost both of these transporters. since c. variabilis nc64a and c. subellipsoidea c- <dig> have both transporters, it is possible that the loss of these transporters from the cp <dig> genome might have happened recently, after the divergence of these species from their last common ancestor. on the other hand, the increased number of amino acid transporters, as revealed by domain analysis using pfam , suggests that cp <dig> has adapted to an environment rich in amino acids, and this is consistent with its previously reported n-source preference  <cit> .

our study unveiled a fine-tuned pathway for lipid synthesis in cp <dig> under heterotrophic growth conditions. first, the glucose in the medium is transported into the cell via the glucose transporters cpr <dig> , cpr <dig> , and cpr <dig> . preliminary data also suggested that the three transporters responded differently upon exposure to media containing different amounts of glucose. this was first hinted at by the transcriptomic comparison between autotrophic and heterotrophic cells. one or more of these transporters may enable the alga not only to grow heterotrophically, but also to accumulate large amounts of glucose in the cell to fulfill the energy requirement for lipid synthesis. then, after glucose enters the cells, it is broken down through glycolysis and the tca cycle. in heterotrophic cells of cp <dig>  nearly all the glycolytic enzymes, including rate-limiting enzymes such as 6-phosphofructokinase  and pyruvate kinase  were significantly increased . the tca cycle was also enhanced under heterotrophic conditions. the increased production of the enzymes in these two pathways ensured a high rate of catabolism of glucose to meet the demand for energy and intermediates for rapid growth and lipid synthesis. as such, high glycolytic ability may be one of the bases for the ability of cp <dig> to accumulate large amounts of lipid. by contrast, a similar function in c. reinhardtii seems much weakened despite the fact that this species can also utilize glucose after a transporter is introduced. however, its growth under heterotrophic conditions is limited and the cells fail to accumulate large amounts of lipids  <cit> . secondly, acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase  is regarded as one of the key enzymes in regulating the carbon flux to fatty acid biosynthesis, and over-expression of this enzyme could increase the lipid content  <cit> . coincidentally, we found that expression of both the biotin carboxyl carrier subunit  and the biotin carboxylase  subunit of the heteromeric accase were elevated in heterotrophic cells . in addition, all components of the fatty acid synthase subunits, which catalyze the elongation of fatty acids, are also upregulated . the presence and elevated expression of these enzymes indicated that cp <dig> has adopted a unique pathway to ensure the rapid biosynthesis of fatty acids. finally, the fatty acyl-coa generated during de novo synthesis is esterified to make tag, which will eventually be stored inside the lipid bodies. this requires glycerol-3-phosphate , a product derived from either glycerol or dihydroxyacetone phosphate . in cp <dig>  the upregulation of the two isozymes of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , which produce g3p from dhap, ensures the supply of g3p. to meet the cells’ consequent requirement for dhap, the alga adopted a mechanism generally used in higher plants: inactivation of triose phosphate isomerase   <cit> , a key enzyme that catalyzes the isomerization between dhap and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate , directly linking glycolysis and tag synthesis. a previous study revealed that deficiency of triose phosphate isomerase increased the fatty acid or oil content in root cells of plants  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that in cp <dig>  a similar mechanism is deployed and the triose phosphate isomerase may be the key enzyme in regulating the carbon flux to fatty acid synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we report in this paper an annotated draft genome of the oleaginous alga cp <dig>  a candidate for use as a model alga for biofuel production. several unique features of the genome were revealed in this analysis. first, the genome size is greatly reduced and the gene number is relatively small, but most of the genes are homologous to c. variabilis nc64a, implying that cp <dig> is evolutionarily related but probably distant from other chlorella. secondly, the undersized genome of cp <dig> may be due to a smaller number of genes encoded in the genome, fewer copies of duplicated and unique genes, and/or a more ancient genome with fewer duplications and rearrangements. thirdly, three hup-like genes, which are unique to chlorella, were identified in the genome, providing a molecular basis for cp <dig> to be able to consume glucose and grow heterotrophically. finally, cp <dig> is the only sequenced green alga that lacks both the nitrate and urea transporter, suggesting that it may be unique in nitrogen metabolism. in addition, through comparative transcriptomic and proteomic studies on autotrophic and heterotrophic cp <dig>  we generated a global view regarding the changes in metabolic pathways under the two growth conditions. we observed that under heterotrophic conditions, enzymes involved in photosynthesis and co <dig> fixation are almost completely degraded, either as mrnas or as proteins. meanwhile, the cells are capable of not only quickly absorbing glucose but also accelerating glucose catabolism through the upregulation of glycolysis and the tca cycle, which can presumably provide enough energy for both rapid cell growth and enhanced lipid synthesis. moreover, the rapid synthesis of pyruvate, the upregulation of most enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, and the downregulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation favor the accumulation of fatty acids within the cell. this suggests that cp <dig> encodes a fine-tuned pathway for the accumulation of large amounts of lipid under heterotrophic growth conditions.
