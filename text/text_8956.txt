BACKGROUND
the distinctive coat pattern of a dalmatian is the result of the interaction of several genes. specifically, it is known the extreme piebald allele of the piebald locus, in conjunction with the ticked allele of the ticking locus, and nonflecked allele of the flecking locus, produces pigmented spots on a white background  <cit> . the color of the pigmented spots in registered dalmatians is black or liver  <cit> , but the locus responsible for the color variation has not been identified in the dalmatian. other colors are rare, but can be found  <cit> .

several classic pigmentation loci, such as agouti, extension, and brown, have been characterized at the molecular level. the brown locus describes tyrosinase related protein  <dig> , which controls the production of eumelanin in melanocytes  <cit> . in the dog, the dominant wild-type allele results in black eumelanin while the recessive brown allele results in brown eumelanin  <cit> . the extension locus has been found to be the melanocortin  <dig> receptor  protein  <cit> , which has an epistatic relationship with the agouti locus  <cit> . the epistatic relationship between agouti and extension acts as a switch for melanocytes to produce either phaeomelanin or eumelanin, with certain alleles resulting in a red or reddish-brown color  <cit> .

all dalmatians are homozygous for the piebald, ticking, and flecking loci  complicating characterization of these loci through standard techniques, such as linkage analysis, since there is not a segregating phenotype to detect. however, black and liver spot color is a detectable phenotype that segregates in mendelian fashion. the objective of this study was to utilize a previously described multi-generational kindred of dalmatians  <cit>  to conduct a genome scan and perform linkage analysis to detect linkage between spot color and a microsatellite marker. detection of linkage will provide insight as to which locus may be responsible for black versus liver in the dalmatian.

RESULTS
twopoint linkage analysis for spot color was performed using solar v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> polymorphic markers from the dalmatian kindred. marker fh <dig> resulted in a statistically significant lod score of  <dig>   <cit> . fh <dig> was previously mapped to chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig>  mb  <cit> . none of the remaining  <dig> markers resulted in a lod score above the standard significance threshold of  <dig>  including four additional polymorphic markers on cfa <dig>  the spot color and corresponding genotypes for a subset of the kindred are shown in figure  <dig> 

discussion
a genome scan was performed on a multi-generational kindred of dalmatians, previously analyzed for heritability and segregation of deafness  <cit> . spot color has been shown to not be associated with deafness in the dalmatian  <cit> . twopoint linkage analysis using solar produced a lod score of  <dig>  for marker fh <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  based on the canine genome map  <cit> , the tyrp <dig>  locus is at position  <dig>  mb, which is approximately  <dig>  mb from fh <dig>  given the recent characterization of tyrp <dig> genetic variations in the dog  <cit>  and the linkage evidence reported here, tyrp <dig> is likely responsible for the spot color variation of black versus liver seen in the dalmatian.

included in figure  <dig> are suspected alleles of the brown locus for the depicted dogs. dog  <dig> is heterozygous for the dominant b allele of the brown locus  while dog  <dig> is homozygous for the recessive b allele of the brown locus . progeny of dogs  <dig> and  <dig> reveal marker fh <dig> allele  <dig>  in this family, is linked with the b allele of the brown locus. additional alleles of marker fh <dig> were also linked with the b allele in the dalmatian kindred . due to this fact, linkage alone is not enough to establish if a dog with an unknown brown locus genotype  is homozygous or heterozygous for the dominant allele.

a recent study  <cit>  examined genetic variations in the tyrp <dig> and mc1r loci in numerous dog breeds to determine the effect of the variations on black and brown pigmentation. while this work characterized the associations of specific mutations found in these genes with the pigmentation phenotypes examined, only one dalmatian  was included. based on examination of the kindred reported here, the tyrp <dig> gene should be further characterized in the dalmatian to determine the specific genetic variations associated with the dominant and recessive alleles of the brown locus.

CONCLUSIONS
statistically significant linkage was found between marker fh <dig> and spot color in a kindred of dalmatians. fh <dig> is  <dig>  mb from the tyrp <dig> locus, supporting evidence that its gene product is responsible for the black or liver color of a dalmatian's spots. further characterization of tyrp <dig> in the dalmatian is warranted to determine the specific genetic variations causative for color variation.
