BACKGROUND
short interfering rnas  are double-stranded rnas typically of length between  <dig> and  <dig> with  <dig> nucleotide overhangs on the 3' ends, and they are capable of inducing sequence-specific, post-transcriptional deletion of gene products, leading to the silencing of the gene activity. naturally occurring sirnas are cleavage products from long double-stranded rnas  by dicer, a ribonuclease iii enzyme  <cit> . the sirna-induced mrna degradation is a complicated process involving multiple steps, initiated by the binding of sirna with risc , followed by risc's activation, resulting in the recognition of the target mrna and the degradation of the latter  <cit> . as a gene knock-down tool used in labs, sirnas can also be chemically synthesized and introduced into the cells by direct transfection  <cit>  or delivered into the cells in forms of hairpin precursors through plasmid or viral vectors  <cit> . the sirna-based gene knock-down techniques are preferred by many because of their ability to disrupt individual gene's function without affecting related genes  <cit> . these techniques are particularly attractive for gene silencing studies in mammalian cells, because, unlike longer double-stranded rnas, sirnas are not likely to trigger interferon responses which lead to non-specific mrna degradation  <cit> .

the efficacy issue represents a major challenge in sirna design. this issue concerns the question of how to choose from the large number of candidate sirnas the ones that give rise of the highest levels of knock-down activity. it is well known that only a fraction of these candidate sirnas are highly effective in silencing the target genes. two sirnas targeting the mrna sites that are separated by only a few nucleotides could exhibit very different knock-down efficacies  <cit> . what are the properties some sirnas possess that render them more effective in knocking down the target genes than others? this is an issue of heated debate. several sets of rules for designing high-efficacy sirnas have been proposed . in addition, a long list of factors have been claimed to influence sirna knock-down efficacy and thus should be considered in sirna design  <cit> .

there are significant disagreements among these design rules and considerable controversies over these claims. this situation has been discussed extensively in several recent review articles  <cit> , therefore we only list some examples of these disagreements here:  <cit>  suggested that the sequence information alone was sufficient in determining the efficacy of a sirna; however,  <cit>  advocated the need to incorporate thermodynamic properties  in assisting sirna design; while  <cit>  emphasized the importance of the accessibility to the mrna sites by the sirnas, and endorsed methods of filtering candidate sirnas based on mrna secondary structure properties. on factors determined by sirna sequences,  <cit>  recommended choosing of sequences of intermediate g/c contents  for effective sirnas, while  <cit>  endorsed the choosing of sequences of lower g/c contents  to increase the chance of making high-efficacy sirnas. on position-specific properties,  <cit>  suggested that the nucleotides on positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on the sense strand played a critical role in determining the knock-down efficacy; while  <cit>  claimed that positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and perhaps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on the sense strand were important in determining the knock-down efficacy of the sirnas.

the debates over sirna efficacy go beyond the disagreements among these design rules. in fact, the effectiveness of these rules per se is in question.  <cit>  showed that most published sirna design tools output large numbers of ineffective sirnas, and had a similar performance to  a random selector when tested on data of an independent origin.  <cit>  made similar observations, and alleged that several published efficacy predicting algorithms gave close to random classification on unseen data.

at least two groups of researchers pointed out that many existing studies on sirna design criteria suffered from the "overfitting" problem  <cit> . this term describes scenarios where rules are extracted from datasets that have small sample sizes, low signal-to-noise ratios, and unique experimental settings. rules obtained under these conditions are prone to spurious effects caused by noise in the data samples or specific aspects of the experimental settings or both; rules obtained in this manner are likely to perform unsatisfactorily when used on data obtained under different experimental settings.

the key to countering the overfitting problem and developing truly effective and generally applicable sirna design rules is the availability of a large collection of sirna efficacy data from diverse origins. we recently undertook the effort to document all sirna experiments in published studies and provide sensible efficacy ratings of these experiments. this effort resulted in sirecords, the largest known curated database of mammalian sirna experiments with consistent efficacy ratings  <cit> . the availability of the sirecords data makes it possible to better analyze factors responsible for achieving effective rnai experiments.

in this study, we first conducted a survey on the sirecords data of all known "features" previously implicated to influence sirna knock-down efficacy. this survey resulted in a list of features that significantly boosted the chance of achieving higher sirna efficacies. then, we examined quantitatively how these significant features interact with one another in their joint effects on achieving higher efficacies. the combinations of features that give rise to the highest levels of boosting to sirna efficacies were picked and reorganized using a disjunctive rule merging  procedure, which led to a bundle of non-redundant rule sets with controlled stringency level. the performance of these rule sets  was then assessed using a reserved dataset and compared with existing design tools commonly used in current sirna design practice.

an implementation of the drm rule sets developed in this study is available for testing as an online sirna design server  <cit> .

RESULTS
overview of sirecords data
sirecords is a continuing effort aimed to document all mammalian sirna experiments reported in literature, and provide systematically rated efficacies for these experiments  <cit> . currently, about  <dig> records of sirna experiments targeting more than  <dig> genes are hosted in the sirecords database. for each sirna experiment, we document the sirna sequence, the target gene, key information about experimental conditions , and an efficacy rating .

for this investigation, we picked all complete records of 19-mer sirna experiments  from the sirecords collection . the distribution of number of records per study is highly skewed – about  <dig> % of the records  originated from  <dig> % of the studies . to prevent our analyses from being biased by this small number of studies, we limited the number of sirna experiments originated from a single study to be ≤  <dig>  for these studies where more than  <dig> sirna experiments were reported, we randomly picked  <dig> to include in our analyses and discarded the rest. the resulting dataset includes the records of  <dig> sirna experiments targeting  <dig> genes originated from  <dig> independent studies. we randomly divided the dataset into two subsets at a 2: <dig> ratio. the larger subset – termed set a – included  <dig> records, and was used to survey features significantly associated with high efficacies and analyze the combinatorial effects of these features. the other subset  was reserved to test the conclusions obtained through the analyses of set a.

survey of features significantly boosting sirna efficacy
we set out to determine, using the set a data, what "features" of the sirna experiments are associated with elevated rnai efficacies. a feature is a binary property of a sirna experiment concerning a factor potentially relevant to sirna efficacy, for example, the 6th nucleotide of the sirna sequence = a. each feature has a "complementary feature". a feature and its complementary feature constitute a "feature pair". more discussions about the definition of feature and related terms can be found in methods.

in sirecords, the effectiveness of any sirna experiment is rated on a four-level scale: very high , high , medium ; and low . in set a, the percentages of records receiving very high, high, medium and low efficacy ratings are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . the decision of using this four-level rating scheme was made based on balanced considerations about the usefulness and the reliability of the ratings  <cit> . one consequence of this decision is that that the conventional t-test type of analysis  <cit>  can not be performed on this dataset, because the dependent variable  is not a continuous variable, but rather a categorical, ordinal variable. proper categorical analysis techniques need to be adopted to analyze this type of data  <cit> .

we chose to use the wald test of monotone trend to assess the evidence that the presence of a feature is associated with a significant up-shift  of the efficacy distribution. in addition, we conducted odds ratio permutation tests for two efficacy levels: > 90% and > 70% efficacies, because in sirna design practice, we are interested in assessing whether a feature leads to increased chances of achieving higher efficacies . for instance, a wald test of monotone trend indicated that the presence of the feature the 6th nucleotide of the sirna sequence = a is associated with significant up-shift of the efficacy distribution ; odds ratio permutation tests showed that the presence of this feature led to significant increase in the probabilities of achieving both > 90%  and > 70%  efficacies .

we examined  <dig> features  for their association with higher rnai efficacies, using the wald test of monotone trend and the odds ratio permutation tests. the features we examined include, to our knowledge, all that have been implicated in previous studies to improve sirna effectiveness. each of these features can be placed into one of five categories. the first category is based on nucleotide identities at specific positions on the 19-mer sirna sequence, e.g. the 6th nucleotide = a; there are  <dig> feature pairs in this category. the second category includes  <dig> feature pairs that are either composite sequence features, e.g. there are at least three 's in the seven nucleotides at the 3' end of the sirna, or features that are defined based on the g/c content of the sirna. the third category consists of  <dig> feature pairs that are based on the thermodynamics of the sirnas as measured by the melting temperature, or binding energy. the fourth category, consisting of  <dig> feature pairs, includes features based on target mrna sites, such as the relative positions of the target sites on the mrna, and the local secondary structures of the target regions. finally, the fifth category includes  <dig> feature pairs that are based on experimental settings, such as the cell lines used in the experiments , the methods used for making and delivering the sirnas, and the methods used to evaluate the efficacy of the sirna . the complete list of these tested features, and references to the studies that implicated them in enhancing sirna efficacies, are provided in supplementary tables 1- <dig> in additional file  <dig> 

at p <  <dig> , the fdr for the three tests: wald test of monotone trend, permutation test of odds ratios  and permutation test of odds ratios  were controlled at the levels of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

comparison made based on set t . default settings were used for the  <dig> online predicting tools. two sets of parameters  were calculated for each predicting tool or rule set. one was for > 90% efficacy , the other one was for > 70% .

comparison made based on the independent subset of set t . default settings were used for the  <dig> online predicting tools. a sirna experiment was considered effective if it achieved > 70% efficacy .

of the features examined, we found  <dig> that were associated with a significant improvement in the efficacy distribution ; among which,  <dig> significantly elevated the chance of achieving > 90% efficacies , and  <dig> significantly enhanced the probability of achieving > 70% efficacies . there are several cases of sub-feature – super-feature relationships among these significant features. for example, the features the 6th nucleotide = a, and the 6th nucleotide ≠ c were both significant features, however, the former is a sub-feature of the latter since when the former feature is present, the latter must also be present. in each occurrence of sub-feature – super-feature relationship, we eliminated all but the one feature determined to be the most significant by the wald test. the feature the 6th nucleotide = a was thus eliminated because the wald test p value of this feature was higher than that of the feature the 6th nucleotide ≠ c. g/c content related features were treated as a special case. several different g/c content ranges were suggested in previous studies as being possibly associated with high rnai effectiveness   <cit> . all these features were tested. although they do not constitute sub-feature – super-feature relationships, we treated these features as redundant features, and retained only one of them  because it yielded the lowest p value  in the wald test. the resulting list of non-redundant significant features is shown in table  <dig>  detailed discussions about these significant features, and comparisons of our analyses with previous findings can be found in the additional file  <dig> 

combined effects of multiple significant features
the presence of any single significant feature was not sufficient to improve the efficacy distribution substantially. when present alone, the significant features listed in table  <dig> increased the probability of achieving > 90% efficacies by an average of only  <dig> % , and they increased the chance of achieving > 70% efficacies by an average of merely  <dig> % . to achieve substantially improved efficacies, the concurrent presence of several significant features is required.

when multiple features are co-present, we cannot assume that their contributions to the effectiveness of the rnai experiments are additive, since features are not always independent of one another. for instance, the presence of the feature the 19th nucleotide = , clearly increases the probability that the feature there are at least three 's in the seven nucleotides on the 3' end of the sirna to be true. indeed, these two features exhibited negative cooperativity: when present alone, they increased the chances of achieving > 90% efficacies by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively; when co-present, these two features resulted in merely a  <dig> % increase in the chance of achieving > 90% efficacy, much smaller than the sum of the effects of the two features .

in seeking effective sirna design rules, we should try to identify combinations of features that exhibit positive cooperativity. the large size and diverse origins of the records in the sirecords dataset allowed us to systematically analyze how features jointly influence sirna efficacies. three significant features: cell line = hela, test method = western blot and test object ≠ mrna were excluded from joint effect analyses because they are based on experimental settings, which are typically chosen independent of sirna design. for the remaining  <dig> significant features, we looked at all possible combinations of a fixed number  of features. for each combination of l features, we examined the number of records in set a that concurrently carry all l features, and the percentages of these records that achieved > 90% and > 70% efficacies. for every given l, we focused on the top- <dig> feature combinations, i.e., the  <dig> combinations that exhibited the highest percentage of records achieving > 90% or > 70% efficacies. when there was a tie of more than  <dig> feature combinations, all tied combinations were considered. as we expected, as l – the number of features in the combinations increased, the number of records concurrently carrying all l features declined sharply . meanwhile, the percentage of experiments achieving > 90% and > 70% efficacies increased steadily as l, the number of features included in the feature combinations, increased .

the sigmoid shape of the two ascending curves is an indication of positive cooperativity . this suggests that by simply retaining the feature combinations that led to the highest percentages of records achieving efficacies of > 90% or > 70%, we were, in effect, exploiting the positive cooperativity, or favorable interaction, among these features. at l =  <dig>   <dig> feature combinations had a 100% chance of having efficacies > 70%, that is, every experiment in which the sirna used had all features contained in any one of the  <dig> feature combinations exhibited efficacies of > 70%. similarly,  <dig> feature combinations had 100% probabilities of having efficacies > 90% at l =  <dig>  meaning that all sirna experiments having these feature combinations demonstrated efficacies > 90%. at l =  <dig>   <dig> feature combinations had 100% probabilities of having efficacies of > 70%, and  <dig> feature combinations had 100% probabilities of achieving efficacies of > 90%.

integrated rule sets for effective sirna design
a disjunction of the top feature combinations described above  defines a rule set for designing effective sirna experiments. rule sets defined in this way are likely to contain redundancies, because if a rule consisting of l^

performance comparison between drm rule sets and existing design tools
we assessed the performance of the drm rule sets, and compared it with that of  <dig> existing online design tools commonly used in sirna design practice, using the set t data reserved for this purpose . set t includes the records of  <dig>  sirna experiments, representing  <dig>  unique target sites on  <dig> genes. how do we assess the performance of a sirna design program? a good sirna design program should  provide a sufficient number of candidate sirnas for a given gene; and  offer a high ppv , or a low false positive rate .

on the number of candidate sirnas predicted, the drm rule set with the highest stringency level  produced on average  <dig>  predicted effective sirnas per gene. this indicates that this rule set offers sufficient candidate sirnas in an ordinary sirna design task for a gene of an average length. however, the smallest number of predicted effective sirnas for a gene is  <dig>  this suggests that for genes of the shortest lengths, the number of candidate sirnas offered by this rule set may not be enough. there are considerations other than achieving high efficacy  in the design of sirna experiments, thus it is desirable to have multiple candidate sirnas designed for every gene. for genes of the shortest lengths, we resort to drm rule sets of lower stringency levels. for example, rs <dig>  produced at least  <dig> potentially effective sirnas for each gene, and an average of  <dig>  potentially effective sirnas per gene . the online design tools varied greatly in the numbers of candidate sirnas they provided. the highest number of predicted effective sirnas was offered by emboss sirna by institute pasteur . idt rnai design by idt, inc. produced the lowest number of predicted effective sirnas . among the  <dig> online design tools,  <dig> offered larger numbers of candidate sirnas than drm rs <dig> , and  <dig> provided larger numbers of candidate sirnas than drm rs <dig> .

given that a sufficient number of candidate sirnas are provided, the most important parameter that measures the performance of a design tool is the ppv. only a small proportion of possible sirna sites have been experimentally tested for effectiveness . based on these experimentally tested sirna sites, we compared the ppvs of the drm rule sets to those of  <dig> existing online design tools. for the "> 90% efficacy" setting and "> 70% efficacy" setting, drm rs <dig>  showed ppvs of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in other words,  <dig> % of the predicted effective sirnas by drm rs <dig>  had > 90% efficacy, and  <dig> % of the predicted effective sirnas showed > 70% efficacy. this rule set and two others with lower α level, rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  surpassed all online design tools in ppvs on both settings. among the  <dig> online design tools, the three that offered the highest ppvs for the "> 90% efficacy" setting were wi sirna selection program by whitehead institute , sidesign center by dharmacon inc.  and block-it rnai designer by invitrogen corp. , respectively; and the four that offered the highest ppvs for the "> 70% efficacy" setting were sirna target finder by genscript corp. , wi sirna selection program by whitehead institute , sidesign center by dharmacon. inc.  and sirna target designer by promega corp. , respectively.

set t is a fair dataset to be used for the purpose of performance comparison between the drm rule sets and the online design tools, because it contains no overlapping records with set a, based on which the drm rule sets were derived. however, set t might not be considered as a completely independent dataset, because , there are records in set t that originated from the same studies as some records in set a; and , there are records of sirna experiments in set t that target the same genes as some experiments in set a. to rule out the possibility that these two factors might contribute to better performance of the drm rule sets for unforeseen reasons and unfairly favor the drm rule sets in the performance comparison, we compiled an "independent subset" of set t, eliminating all records that share the same origins of any records in set a, and all records that target the same genes that are also targeted by any records in set a. we compared the performance of the drm rule sets with that of the  <dig> online design tools using this independent subset . because of the reduced size of the dataset , the sensitivity, specificity and ppvs for all tools and rule sets showed higher levels of variability. the three drm rule sets with the highest α levels: rs <dig> , rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  achieved 100% ppv. two online design tools, block-it by invitrogen corp. and wi sirna selection program by whitehead institute also achieved 100% ppv, but the other online design tools achieved lower ppvs that range between  <dig> % and  <dig> %. although the small size of the independent subset prevented this analysis from being completely conclusive, it is fair to state that the comparison made based on the independent subset is generally in agreement with the comparison made based on the entire set t.

discussion
it has been recognized that many existing sirna design criteria  failed to provide promised levels of performance when tested with unseen data largely due to the "overfitting" problem in their development  <cit> . practically, the key to countering this problem is to make use of a large sirna efficacy data from diverse origins when developing sirna design rules. in this study, we took advantage of the recent sirecords collection in our development of the drm rule sets. first, we conducted a survey on the sirecords dataset of all known "features" previously implicated to influence sirna knock-down efficacy. this survey resulted in a list of features that significantly boosted the chance of achieving higher sirna efficacies. then, we examined quantitatively how these significant features interact with one another in their joint effects on achieving higher efficacies. the combinations of features that give rise to the highest levels of boosting to sirna efficacies were picked and reorganized using the drm algorithm, producing the rule sets. finally, the performance of these rule sets was verified on a reserved dataset  and was compared with that of  <dig> online sirna design tools commonly used in current sirna design practice.

the survey of features influencing rnai effectiveness conducted in this study is the largest scale survey of this type ever reported by far . among the significant features identified in the survey  are several that have been implicated in multiple previous studies to influence the sirna efficacy. they include a few features related to weaker binding on the 3' end , at least three s in the seven nucleotides at the 3' end, binding energy of n16–n <dig> > - <dig> kcal/mol, and binding energy of n16–n <dig> – binding energy of n1–n <dig> is between  <dig> and  <dig> kcal/mol), one feature about a lower g/c range , two features related to unusual sequence patterns , one feature related to melting temperature , and one feature related to the target location . however, there are also a small number of features that were not reported to be significant in any previous studies, e.g., the 4th nucleotide = c and the 9th nucleotide = c. it appears that there are higher levels of disagreements for sequence related features  than for features defined based on thermodynamics of the sirnas and on target mrna sites  between our survey results and previous findings, with the exception of the 3-nucleotide segment on the 3' end . notably, three category  <dig> features  cell line = hela, test method = western blot and test object ≠ mrna were among those found to be most significant. although there have been reports about sirna efficacy being influenced by cell lines and test methods  <cit> , this is the first quantitative analysis about how strong these influences are. more details about the significant features found in the survey, and comparisons of our analyses with previous findings are presented in the additional file  <dig> 

in a recently published review article, several considerations for selecting effective sirnas were proposed resulting from summarization and integration of major recent findings in the field of sirna design  <cit> . comparison of these considerations with the survey results obtained in this study indicates that they generally agree with each other . of the  <dig> features pertinent to the considerations proposed by pei and tuschl,  <dig> were found to be significant in boosting the sirna efficacy. among the remaining  <dig> features, the feature g/c content is between  <dig> and 52% was found to be associated with a commensurate, though not significant improvement in the efficacy distribution . two related features, g/c content is between  <dig> and 60% and g/c content is between  <dig>  and  <dig> %, however, were found to be highly significant in boosting the sirna efficacy, agreeing with the common understanding that the effective sirnas prefer a low-to-medium g/c content. two features pertinent to the considerations proposed by pei and tuschl that are related to target accessibility, sirna passes the repelling loop filter and anti-sense sirna binding energy > - <dig> kcal/mol were not found to be significant in our survey. yet, two other features closely related to them, h-b index <  <dig>  and local free energy of the most stable structure ≥ - <dig>  kcal/mol, were found to be significant. the remaining two features pertinent to the considerations proposed by pei and tuschl, binding energy of n6–n <dig> ≥ - <dig> kcal/mol and 10th nucleotide = , were not found to be significant in our survey.

since the sirecords collection is compiled from published sirna studies, there is the concern that it may be biased towards higher efficacy sirnas, because researchers are probably less inclined to report lower efficacy experiments in their research articles. we can assess how much this bias is by comparing the efficacy distribution of the sirecords collection with that of published randomly designed sirnas. in two published studies  <cit> , moderately large numbers  of randomly designed sirnas were tested for knock-down efficacies. the percentages of sirnas resulting in < 50% efficacies in these two studies were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in the sirecords data used in this study, the percentage of records receiving "low" efficacy rating  is  <dig> %. in one of these previous studies  <cit> , the percentage of sirnas resulting in > 90% efficacies was reported to be  <dig> %. in the sirecords collection, the percentage of records receiving "very high" efficacy rating  is  <dig> %. therefore, the sirecords collection is indeed biased towards the higher efficacy experiments, likely because researchers are less ready to report lower efficacy experiments. however, this bias is not severe, because nearly 2/ <dig> of the low efficacy sirna experiments are still included in sirecords. furthermore, the analyses conducted in this study – in particular, the results of the survey of features influencing the sirna efficacy – are not influenced by the reduced number of low efficacy sirnas in the dataset. these analyses are reliable as long as the dataset includes sufficiently large number of low efficacy records .

another concern over the using of the sirna data compiled from published sirna studies is that the design of sirna experiments in these published studies might be dominated by one or two design tools used in the performance comparison , compromising the objectiveness of this comparison. an analysis of the relative utility of the  <dig> online sirna design tools  suggested that these design tools had varied levels of utility, yet none of them had dominated the current sirna design practice .

it is desirable to validate the drm rule sets obtained in this study using a dataset independent of sirecords. however, it is considerably difficult to find a separate sirna efficacy dataset that is as large and diverse as the sirecords collection. in a recent report by huesken et al., a genome-wide human sirna library was constructed, in which  <dig>  randomly selected sirnas targeting  <dig> fusion mrnas were tested for efficacy  <cit> . there were concerns when this library of sirnas was considered as a validation dataset for the drm rule sets, because, firstly, this dataset is of a singular origin; and secondly, fusion mrnas were used against which the sirna efficacies were tested. this is considered as a somewhat questionable practice because the native secondary structures may not be well preserved in the fusion mrnas. although huesken et al. performed control experiments which suggested that fusion mrnas and endogenous mrnas produced similar efficacy estimates in the setting they adopted, and argued that sequence features, rather than secondary structure related features were the main determinants of the sirna efficacy, there have been multiple recent reports about secondary structures playing important roles in determining the sirna efficacy  <cit> , which are backed up by the finding in our survey that at least one secondary structure related feature  ≥ - <dig>  kcal/mol) significantly boosts the chance of achieving higher sirna efficacy. nevertheless, we examined the performance of the drm rule sets using the  <dig>  sirna dataset provided by huesken et al. the three drm rule sets with the highest stringency  identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> effective sirnas, respectively, in this dataset. these selected sirnas had average "normalized inhibitory activity" of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. when tested using the 249-sirna test dataset specified in that study, the same three drm rule sets identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> effective sirnas, respectively, and the average "normalized inhibitory activity" of these sirnas were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in huesken et al., the average "normalized inhibitory activity" of the entire dataset was  <dig> , and they recommended to use  <dig>  or  <dig>  as cut-offs for selecting effective sirnas. these results suggest that generally speaking, the drm rule sets were capable of identifying effective sirnas in this completely independent sirna efficacy dataset.

as more data becomes available in sirecords, we will perform updated analyses on this data collection with the aim of obtaining more accurate and more reliable sirna design rules. in addition, as there is indication that the drm rule sets behave differently for subpopulations of sirnas tested under different experimental settings , we will refine our analyses and develop separate rule sets for these different subpopulations of sirnas.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified a bundle of highly effective and generally applicable rule sets for sirna design. this was accomplished by applying a simple strategy in which we analyzed a large number of candidate features for association with increased sirna efficacies, then used quantitative analyses of the joint effects of these significant features to identify positive cooperativity among these features. the key to our approach was the use of the large set of sirna efficacy data available in sirecords. the availability of this dataset not only made the execution of this strategy possible, but also curbed the overfitting problem that many rules generated by other design protocols suffer from. we expect that the design rules revealed in this study, together with improving rnai lab techniques, will make sirnas a more useful tool for molecular genetics, functional genomics, and drug discovery studies.
