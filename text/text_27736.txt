BACKGROUND
due to the limitations of current drug delivery systems, which have been hampered by their inefficiencies in traversing the cell membrane, there is a pressing need to develop methods for increasing intracellular delivery of protein-based cargoes. over the past decade, numerous strategies to overcome the cell membrane barrier have been proposed, including electroporation, microinjection, viral vectors, liposome encapsulation and receptor-mediated endocytosis. these methods have, however, been plagued by low delivery efficiencies and, to some extent, increased cellular toxicity. naturally occurring short cell-penetrating peptides  derived from viral, insect or mammalian proteins, have attracted considerable interest in the field of drug delivery for their ability to direct cellular uptake through active transport mechanisms. cpps are oligopeptides, 11– <dig> amino acid residues in length, that are capable of conferring their apparent translocation activity to proteins and other macromolecular cargo to which they are linked  <cit> . in recent years, cpps have been studied extensively, both in vitro and in vivo, for their ability to delivery an array of pharmalogically relevant cargoes, such as antisense oligonucleotides, peptides, proteins, plasmids, liposomes and nanometer-sized particles, with encouraging results  <cit> . lately, cpps have also been used to treat preclinical models of human disease  <cit> .

one of the most well-studied and efficient cell penetrating peptides is the 11-amino-acid peptide of the human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  tat protein. this basic region of tat, containing amino acid residues 47– <dig>   <cit> , is crucial for many key functions of the protein, including interaction with the transactivation-responsive region in viral mrna  <cit> , nuclear localization  <cit> and most importantly, cellular uptake  <cit> . tat47– <dig> has been shown to direct the internalization of an extensive list of cargoes ranging from small peptides  <cit>  to proteins and polymers  <cit> , liposomes  <cit> , phage vectors  <cit> , plasmid dnas  <cit>  and even nanoparticles  <cit> . moreover, tat47– <dig> has also been used in vivo to deliver biologically active β-galactosidase into all tissues of the mouse, even the brain  <cit> .

a variety of internalization routes for the tat47– <dig> sequence and tat-mediated cargoes have been suggested. in the study of fittipaldi et al.  and ferrari et al.  tat11egfp and gst-tat-egfp proteins were reported to internalize into cells via caveolae-mediated endocytosis and transported further to the perinuclear area via an actin cytoskeleton-mediated mechanism  <cit> . wadia et al.  in turn showed the internalization of the tat-cre protein into cells by lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis  <cit> , and richard et al.  suggested the uptake of the tat peptide via clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . recently, also säälik et al.  demonstrated the uptake of biotinylated tat, detected with fitc-labeled avidin, via both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis  <cit> . central to the use of tat, however, is not only its ability to deliver cargo to cells but, importantly, its non-cytotoxicity and stable biological activity over long time periods  <cit> .

core streptavidin  from streptomyces avidinii has been used in many pharmalogical applications. the exact mechanism of its cellular uptake and intracellular delivery is, however, not well known. the internalization of sa has been suggested to occur via receptor-mediated endocytosis, involving lysine residues  <cit>  and the ryd sequence   <cit> . in vivo, the biodistribution of sa has been shown to exhibit slow clearance from the bloodstream due to accumulation in the kidney  <cit> . the present study was designed to gain insight into the internalization of a novel tat-streptavidin  construct  <cit>  in human cells. additionally, the ability of tat-sa as a transporter of biotin and biotinylated molecules was examined. the subcellular distribution of tat-sa was altered by biotinylated, ph-responsive polymer poly , which further promoted the endosomal release. these studies provide insights into the mechanism of tat-sa uptake in cells and may have implications for the optimal use of tat-sa and ppaa for the intracellular delivery of numerous biotinylated macromolecules.

RESULTS
characterization of tat-sa constructs
the structure of tat-streptavidin  has been previously described  <cit>  as a tetrameric fusion protein, in which the tat47– <dig> peptide has been attached to the n-terminus of each streptavidin monomer. biotins or biotinylated molecules are located into binding pockets of sa. in this study, the stability and biotin-binding ability of tat-sa were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and immunoblot analysis. both constructs, tat-sa and alexa488-labeled tat-sa , retained their tetrameric  conformations in reducing conditions as either apoform or bound to biotin. when samples were preheated to 68°c, a minor proportion of tat-sa or tat-sa-a <dig> were detected as monomeric  or dimeric  forms. binding of biotin to tat-sa, however, stabilized the constructs at 68°c, since only tetrameric proteins were detected . importantly, reducing conditions and preheatmeant to 37°c did not change the tetrameric conformations of either tat-sa or tat-sa bound to biotin .

microscopical analysis of tat-sa and sa uptake
tat-sa  was shown to internalize into human epithelial carcinoma , human lung carcinoma  and human lung fibroblast  cell lines at  <dig> h post transduction . in living hela cells tat-sa-a <dig> was observed to cross the cell membrane rapidly, starting at  <dig> min post transduction, by confocal microscopy. at later timepoints the majority of tat-sa-a <dig> was localized in vesicular compartments within the cytoplasm, and only few cells displayed detectable nuclear accumulation at  <dig> h post transduction . control studies in which cells were first transduced either with tat-sa-a <dig> or tat-sa, fixed at  <dig> post transduction and immunostained for sa confirmed that both studies in living and fixed cells resulted in a similar subcellular localization. additionally, in cells transduced with sa-a <dig>  alone, the cellular uptake was reduced . the role of tat during the nuclear import of sa was confirmed by injecting tat-sa-a <dig> or sa-a <dig>  directly into the cytosol of hela cells. at  <dig> h post injection the majority of tat-sa-a <dig> was found to accumulate in the nucleoplasm with only minor localization in the cytoplasm. in the nucleus tat-sa-a <dig> was distributed evenly throughout the nucleoplasm without accumulation into distinct subnuclear structures . in contrast, sa-a <dig> was distributed randomly throughout the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus .

to monitor further the internalization and intracellular transport of tat-sa and sa, transduced hela cells were labeled with an antibody against sa and nanogold-immunolabeling electron microscopy with a silver enhancement technique was used. intracellular tat-sa, visualized as small, intensely labeled, grainy spots was localized in large intracellular vesicles near the cell surface or in endocytic-like vesicles adjacent to the nuclear membrane at  <dig> h p.t . at the same time a small proportion of tat-sa was observed in the cytosol and the nucleus of cells . interestingly, in the control experiments sa was observed in smaller cytoplasmic vesicles without any nuclear localization than in those displaying tat-sa at  <dig> min to  <dig> h post transduction.

endocytic entry pathways of tat-sa
to study the potential role of caveolar endocytosis in the uptake of tat-sa, hela cells were transduced and immunolabeled with caveolin- <dig> antibody. no colocalization of tat-sa-a <dig> and caveolin was, however, apparent at 15– <dig> min post transduction. in addition, the internalization of tat-sa-a <dig> into living hela cells was not blocked in the presence of the cholesterol-depleting agent β-methylcyclodextrin, a known inhibitor of caveolae-mediated endocytosis. importantly, control studies with human hepatoma  cells, which do not express caveolins endogenously, demonstrated the efficient internalization of tat-sa .

in order to characterize clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis in the uptake of tat-sa, ap180-c plasmid encoding a dominant-negative form of ap <dig>  an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, was used  <cit> . in hela cells overexpressing ap180-c, the internalization of tat-sa was reduced, but not completely inhibited at  <dig> h post transduction , whereas the uptake of a clathrin-mediated endocytotic marker, transferrin , was markedly decreased. in the absence of ap180-c plasmid, immunofluorescence studies revealed slight colocalization of tat-sa-a <dig> and an early endosomal marker  at  <dig> min post transduction as well as of tat-sa-a <dig> and a recycling endosomal marker  at  <dig> min post transduction . in addition, the lysosomal marker lamp- <dig> showed clear colocalization with tat-sa-a <dig> at 2– <dig> h post transduction .

the kinetics of tat-sa translocation from the cell periphery towards the nuclear periphery at different times was monitored in living hela cells in the presence of the fluorescent endocytic markers transferrin and dextran. partial colocalization of tat-sa-a <dig> and tritc-labeled transferrin  was observed first at  <dig> min post transduction in close proximity to the cell membrane and later at 15– <dig> min post transduction in perinuclear vesicles . in order to examine the role of non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a fluid-phase endosomal marker tritc-labeled dextran , was used to monitor macropinocytic entry pathway. as shown in figures 4b, 4c and in additional file  <dig>  extensive colocalization of tat-sa-a <dig> and tritc-dextran was observed at both  <dig> min and  <dig> h post transduction. moreover, quantitative analysis of the confocal images  revealed an approximately 10-fold higher colocalization between tat-sa-a <dig> and tritc-dextran  than tat-sa-a <dig> and tritc-tf  at  <dig> min post transduction .

the uptake of tat-sa was further examined in living hela cells by quantitative image analysis  in the presence of different endocytic inhibitors. in comparison to relative fluorescence intensity of untreated, transduced control cells  a microtubule-disrupting drug, nocodazole, caused only a slight decrease  of intracellular tat-sa-a <dig>  in cells treated with the filamentous f-actin elongation inhibitor cytochalasin d, affecting both macropinocytosis and clathrin-dependent endocytosis, a clear decrease  in the amount of cytoplasmic tat-sa was, however, measured. furthermore, amiloride, an inhibitor of na+/h+ exchange required for macropinocytosis, displayed significantly reduced  amounts of tat-sa uptake. importantly, in control experiments extensive disruption of microtubules or actin filaments was observed in cells treated either with nocodazole or cytochalasin d and amiloride. additionally, cytochalasin d and amiloride markedly decreased the internalization of tritc-dextran in living cells .

the endosomal release of tat-sa and tat-sa bound to biotin via the ppaa polymer
the streptavidin-biotin association is one of the strongest known non-covalent interactions in nature. in order to alter the subcellular distribution of tat-sa, a biotinylated, ph-responsive polymer poly  was complexed to tat-sa  to promote endosomal release. the 3d illustrations of live hela cells showed that tat-sa complexed with biotinylated ppaa was localized both in cytoplasmic vesicles and in the nucleus at  <dig> h post transduction . interestingly, tat-sa was shown to accumulate into distinct nuclear foci, suggesting interactions with subnuclear components . moreover, quantitative analysis  of the relative nuclear fluorescence intensity demonstrated that ppaa induced over 2-fold increase in the intranuclear tat-sa- <dig>  when compared to tat-sa-a <dig> transduced control cells .

the ability of tat-sa to act as an intracellular delivery vector by transporting biotin and biotinylated molecules into cells was also examined by confocal microscopy. as shown in the 3d illustration, tat-sa-a <dig>  and biotin-dy- <dig>  accumulated in large intracellular vesicles near the nucleus . no nuclear localization of tat-sa was observed, however. further experiments demonstrated strong colocalization of the tat-sa-biotin complex and tritc-dextran in vesicles at the nuclear periphery at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post transduction, implying that most of the tat-sa-biotin complexes were unable to escape from the intracellular vesicles. when endosomal releasing polymer ppaa was complexed with tat-sa bound biotin, however, a major subnuclear accumulation was observed .

finally, cell viability experiments with mtt cell proliferation assay showed that tat-sa  was not cytotoxic to hela cells at 4– <dig> h post transduction . also no indication of a cytotoxic effect was observed in the presence of tat-sa-complexed, biotinylated ppaa  at 4– <dig> h post transduction and only a slight decrease in cell viability was detected at  <dig> and  <dig> h post transduction  compared to untransduced control cells .

discussion
the cell membrane is a barrier to the intracellular delivery of many pharmacologically important biological macromolecules. several cell penetrating peptides have been shown to possess the ability to direct cellular uptake, including the hiv- <dig> tat peptide. so far tat has been used for directing the intracellular uptake of various biomolecular cargoes. in this study, however, a novel streptavidin fusion protein tat-sa  <cit>  was examined, which enables the transport of biotinylated cargoes into cells. the internalization of tat-sa was characterized in both human cancer  and non-cancer cell lines  . the internalization of sa was a relatively slow process in which detectable amounts of sa-a <dig> were present in the cytoplasm but not the nucleus of hela cells at  <dig> h post transduction . on the contrary, tat-sa displayed rapid and efficient internalization in living hela cells starting at  <dig> min post transduction with distribution into vesicular structures in the cytoplasm after  <dig> min . at later time points, confocal and em imaging demonstrated that the majority of tat-sa was localized in the cytoplasmic vesicles with trace amounts in the nucleus . previously, numerous possible internalization routes for tat have been proposed, such as lipid-raft-mediated macropinocytosis  <cit> , caveolae-mediated endocytosis  <cit>  and clathrin-independent and dependent endocytosis  <cit> . however, the uptake characteristics of the tat peptide alone and of tat-conjugated cargoes have been demonstrated to differ significantly  <cit> . furthermore, tat-mediated internalization process has proposed to be dependent on the properties of the cargo molecule, tat concentration and cell line  <cit> . in our study, streptavidin  as a larger partner of the tat-sa fusion construct  is likely to affect the uptake and intracellular trafficking of the vector. notably, we show here that direct microinjection of high concentrations of tat-sa or sa into the cytoplasm resulted in efficient nuclear uptake of tat-sa but not sa . this verifies previous findings that upon introduction into the cytosol, the tat peptide is capable of mediating the nuclear import of its streptavidin fusion partner. moreover, it is known that positively charged molecules internalize the cells efficiently. consequently, taken to account that the plain sa is negatively charged  and tat-sa is positively charged , tat-sa internalizes the cells more efficiently than sa. taken together, these data demonstrate that tat-sa is efficiently internalized into various human cells but that only a relatively small proportion is further released into the cytoplasm and transported into the nucleus, most likely reflecting the inability of tat-sa to escape from endocytic vesicles.

in order to use tat-sa as a vector to deliver biotinylated molecules into cells, the internalization and delivery mechanisms of the construct have to be characterized in vitro and in vivo. in recent years a number of studies have suggested a variety of internalization routes for tat peptide and tat-mediated cargoes. to study this, three major endocytic pathways involving caveolae, lipid rafts and clathrin-coated pits were analyzed using specific endocytic markers, inhibition agents and immunofluorescence labelings of each pathway. previous studies have suggested the tat peptide enters cells by temperature-dependent, caveolae-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . however, no evidence for the use of the caveolae route in the internalization of tat-sa was observed in the present confocal microscopial colocalization studies with a caveolar marker protein. moreover, treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol depletion agent known to inhibit the caveolae route  <cit>  or transduction of the caveolin-deficient hepg <dig>  and jurkat t cells  <cit>  did not prevent the entry of tat-sa-a <dig> into living cells. altogether, these data imply that endosomal routes other than caveolae-mediated entry are required for the uptake of tat-sa.

it has been suggested that the internalization of sa occurs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . here, the role of clathrin-dependent uptake of tat-sa was monitored in cells overexpressing the mutant ap180-c protein  <cit> . ap-180c is required for the efficient assembly of clathrin-coated pits by interacting with the clathrin heavy chain through its c-terminal clathrin-binding motifs. our data indicated that in ap <dig> overexpressing cells the internalization of tat-sa was only slightly affected, whereas the uptake of tf, a marker of clathrin-dependent endocytosis  <cit> , markedly decreased . the double-immunolabeling studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis showed only minor colocalization of tat-sa with early and recycling endosomal markers at early time points . however, at later stages of endocytosis tat-sa accumulated in lysosomes, the final destination of multiple endocytic pathways . clathrin-mediated endocytosis seemed therefore to be only partially involved in the uptake of tat-sa, the major internalization being mediated by another, more efficient pathway.

many oligoarginine peptides have been proposed as candidates for cellular internalization via macropinocytosis  <cit> . recently, uptake via clathrin-independent endocytosis was also suggested in the internalization of tat-cre and biotinylated tat  <cit> . in our study, the intracellular localization of tat-sa was monitored in living hela cells with various fluorescent endocytic markers. shortly after internalization, only slight colocalization was detected with tat-sa and tf, a clathrin-dependent endocytic marker , whereas extensive colocalization between tat-sa and the fluid-phase endosomal and macropinocytic marker dextran was observed . quantitative measurements of fluorescent intensity at  <dig> h post transduction displayed an approximately 10-fold increase in the colocalization of tat-sa and dextran as compared to tat-sa and tf , thus supporting previous observations of the role of macropinocytosis as an entry mechanism for tat. additionally, when cells were treated with amiloride, a known inhibitor of macropinocytosis  <cit> , the uptake of tat-sa-a <dig> was almost entirely inhibited. in the presence of cytochalasin d, an f-actin-disrupting agent affecting both macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> , only a minor internalization of tat-sa-a <dig> occurred . to conclude, we were able to establish macropinocytosis as a major internalization pathway of tat-sa, as illustrated .

the central interest in this study was to determine the ability of tat-sa to act as a carrier of biotinylated molecules into nucleus of human cells. although numerous studies have been conducted on tat-related protein therapeutics, only a few have attempted to address the intracellular release of macromolecules from endocytic vesicles. various approaches for endosomal escape have been proposed, such as endosome-disrupting agents , acid-sensitive linkers or laser illumination  <cit> . in a recent study by wadia et al.  it was shown that an internalized tat-cre fusion protein was capable of nuclear uptake and the subsequent induction of reporter gene expression. most of the tat-cre peptides were, however, observed to reside in cytoplasmic vesicles and therefore the endosomal escape was enhanced by incorporation of the ha <dig> peptide from the influenza virus hemagglutin protein. albarran et al.  have previously shown the delivery of biologically active alkaline phosphatase  and r-phycoerythrin  into the cytoplasm of jurkat t cells by tat-sa. in present study, it was, however, shown that both tat-sa and tat-sa bound to biotin remained enclosed in endocytic vesicles for several hours after internalization . therefore, the effect of a biotinylated ph-responsive polymer ppaa  <cit>  on the subcellular distribution of tat-sa was investigated. in previous studies ppaa has shown to disrupt endosomes at ph  <dig>  or below, causing the cytosolic release of cargo molecules  <cit> . recently, ppaa has also been shown to enhance the delivery of antibody-targeted conjugates into the cytoplasm  <cit>  and ppaa-containing lipoplexes have improved wound healing in mice  <cit> . our data indicated clearly that the nuclear import of tat-sa-a <dig> or tat-sa bound to biotin was considerably increased when combined with biotinylated ppaa . quantitative analysis of live cells showed an approximately 2-fold increase in the nuclear localization of tat-sa-a488-ppaa complexes compared to tat-sa-a <dig> alone . the endosomal escape of tat-sa-a488-ppaa may, however, been more extensive, since the detection of fluorescence intensity by confocal microscope is not sensitive enough to observe all the nuclear fusion proteins. importantly, no significant cytotoxicity of tat-sa-ppaa was observed by mtt assay even at  <dig> h post transduction . overall, these data further demonstrate that the incorporation of ppaa with tat-sa alters the subcellular distribution of the internalized fusion protein, resulting in improved nuclear delivery of its biotin partner .

recently, several therapeutic applications for tat-mediated cellular internalization have been developed, including the transport of an inhibitor for human papillomavirus type  <dig>  <cit>  and for the apoptosis-promoting caspase- <dig> protein used in hiv-therapy  <cit> , the extension of the cytotoxic activity of herpes simplex virus- <dig> thymidine kinase for cancer therapy  <cit> , dendritic cell-based immunotherapy  <cit>  and enhancement of viral-mediated gene delivery,  <cit>  to name just a few. in this study, the fusion of tat with sa imparts the versatility and precision of the sa-biotin system and allows the complexation of numerous organic and inorganic cargoes. additionally, the tat-sa fusion protein and its use in combination with the endosomal-releasing polymer ppaa demonstrates the potential of this construct for delivering biotinylated molecules into various intracellular compartments, depending on the chemistry of the chosen biotin partner.

CONCLUSIONS
non-viral vector tat-sa internalizes into human cells via both macropinocytosis and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. the subcellular distribution of tat-sa is significantly altered through the incorporation of a ph-sensitive polymer ppaa. here, we have characterized of a novel and versatile vector that is capable of delivering an array of biotinylated macromolecular cargoes into cells.
