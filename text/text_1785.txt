BACKGROUND
the anopheles gambiae mosquito is the primary vector of malaria in sub-saharan africa, where this disease causes  <dig>  million infections and  <dig>  deaths per year  <cit> . malaria control has relied mainly on vector control—with insecticides and insecticide-impregnated nets—and on antimalarial therapy of infected humans. these strategies have reduced malaria prevalence and transmission, but development of insecticide resistance in the vector and of drug resistance in the parasite limit their effectiveness  <cit> . the plasmodium parasite population undergoes a major bottleneck in the mosquito, making it an attractive target for novel strategies to disrupt disease transmission. mosquitoes become infected when they ingest host blood containing plasmodium gametocytes, and fertilization takes place giving rise to a motile ookinete that invades the mosquito midgut epithelia. usually only a few ookinetes  are able to complete their development and multiply in the mosquito. the mosquito midgut is the first epithelial barrier that parasites must traverse to complete their development, and cellular responses of invaded midgut cells have been shown to limit parasite survival  <cit> .

sequencing of the an. gambiae genome was a landmark that provided a powerful platform to advance our understanding of the biology of this mosquito vector and its role in malaria transmission. the genome, published in  <dig>  was done using shotgun sequencing; gene prediction and annotation was done, in large part, in silico based on homology with known genes from other species  <cit> . this is a powerful approach, but it has some limitations, as there can be errors in the predicted gene models and many transcripts—for example, those unique to an. gambiae—could be missed. in drosophila, whole-genome tiling-array expression analysis revealed that the initial genome sequence annotation had missed 30% of the transcripts  <cit> , and in the p. falciparum malaria parasite, the first genome sequence contained errors in 25% of the predicted gene models  <cit> .

here we report the in-depth transcriptome analysis of the an. gambiae mosquito midgut using rna-seq by illumina sequencing with the goal of discovering new transcripts and improving the genome annotation, especially of midgut-expressed genes, as interaction of plasmodium with this organ is critical for the parasite to establish an infection. rna-seq has been used successfully to study transcriptional differences of previously annotated genes, between chemosensory appendages and whole body  <cit>  and between insecticide resistant and susceptible an. gambiae
 <cit> . we explored the mosquito midgut transcriptome of two an. gambiae strains, the l3- <dig> refractory strain that was selected to melanize plasmodium, and the an. gambiae g <dig> susceptible strain under different physiological conditions. mosquitoes were infected with different plasmodium species with a variable level of compatibility  <cit>  to identify the maximum number of transcripts induced in response to infection. samples were collected 24 h after feeding, a time when epithelial cells are responding to ookinete invasion. l3- <dig> females were infected with gametocytes from two different p. falciparum lines: 7g <dig> from brazil, which is melanized and is almost completely eliminated, and the 3d <dig> strain that survives very well in this strain  <cit> . an. gambiae g <dig> was infected with plasmodium berghei, and midguts were collected 24 h after the first infection  or after a second infection   <cit> . we report a high-throughput rna-seq analysis using a genome-based sequence assembly that generated novel transcript models and doubled the number of known transcripts for an. gambiae. furthermore, several of the predicted transcript models were experimentally validated. a transcriptome using a de novo assembly—a strategy that can be particularly useful in organisms whose genome has not been sequenced—was also performed and compared with the genome-based approach. finally, variant analysis of the sequence reads identified many new polymorphisms that could be useful for future genetic studies in this disease vector.

RESULTS
genome-based analysis of illumina reads
illumina sequencing generated a total of ~223 m reads from midguts of a. gambiae g <dig> and l3- <dig> strains. raw reads were processed for quality using btrim  <cit>  to generate ~51-bp high-quality reads . a total of  <dig>  m high-quality reads for the g <dig> and  <dig>  m from the l3- <dig> strain were mapped to the reference an. gambiae genome using tophat  <cit> . most of the reads from g <dig>  and l3- <dig>  mapped to the an. gambiae genome. the sequence reads obtained from both strains were distributed across the three an. gambiae chromosomes , indicating no sequencing bias according to genome location. the gap region of poorly expressed genes in chromosome 3r  corresponds to the heterochromatic region  near subdivision 35b/c  <cit> . most of the mapped reads  mapped to exons of previously annotated genes, covering at least half of the exon sequences.figure  <dig>

transcript models for an. gambiae g <dig> and l3- <dig> strains were generated with cufflinks  <cit>  using the mapped reads. the normalized read coverage values, fragment per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped , for all transcripts obtained were analyzed by frequency, showing that a large number of transcript models had no coverage . this is expected, as the program also considers all the known transcript models based on the annotated genome, and not all of them are transcribed in the adult female midgut. to discard transcript models that had no read coverage  or low coverage, a threshold was set and only transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig> were considered for the rest of the analysis . g <dig> and l3- <dig> transcript models had similar median read coverage values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  fpkm, respectively . cufflinks generated a total of  <dig>  unique midgut transcripts  from both strains combined . these transcripts were compared to the reference genome   <cit>  with cuffcompare . a total of  <dig>  transcripts  had a complete match to previously annotated transcripts, while  <dig>   were potentially novel. of these novel transcripts,  <dig>   aligned with annotated genes either in exons , in introns of the same  or opposite strand  , or they appeared to be isoforms  or pre-mrnas  of reference transcripts. of the potentially novel transcripts  <dig>   map to regions of the genome between annotated genes, and we will refer to them as novel intergenic transcripts .table  <dig>

nits can be subdivided into four different cufflinks transcript codes: unknown intergenic transcripts , transcripts that are within  <dig> kb of a reference transcript and could be polymerase run-ons , intergenic transcripts with repeats , and intergenic transcripts with multiple classifications  . interestingly, 82% of nits had an open reading frame that can code for a peptide of  <dig> amino acids or more. independent evidence was obtained for the existence of  <dig>   nits, because they either had high sequence homology by blast  to the an. gambiae expressed sequence tag database   or to a diptera protein database , and some transcripts had matches to both databases  . the other  <dig>  nits  had no match in any database and appear to be unique to an. gambiae .

independent validation of transcript models
in total,  <dig> transcript models were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  in independent an. gambiae midgut samples to confirm their presence in the midgut transcriptome . transcript models for validation were chosen among low fpkm ranges,  <dig> – <dig> , where  <dig> transcripts corresponded to previously known genes in the reference genome and  <dig> corresponded to transcripts that had not been previously described. of the  <dig> transcripts tested,  <dig>  were confirmed by rt-pcr . the graphic representation of the region in the genome where the sequence reads of three novel intergenic transcripts   that were experimentally validated map is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  a total of  <dig> potential novel splice junctions in annotated genes was also experimentally tested , and most of them  were confirmed using pcr and sanger sequencing. a graphic respresentation of the genomic location of three new exons in a predicted transcript  for the anopheles gambiae cyclin a gene  that was experimentally validated is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the high rate of independent confirmation of expression or novel splice junctions indicates that most of the predicted novel transcripts are real. finally, validation of a larger number of nits was also obtained by microarray analysis. an independent sample of an. gambiae g <dig> strain midgut rna—collected 26 h after feeding on uninfected human blood—was hybridized with a microarray that included  <dig>  probes for nits, and a positive hybridization signal could be detected for  <dig>  of them .

functional annotation of transcripts
the coding potential of the midgut transcripts was analyzed with cpat taking into account open reading frame  size, orf coverage, hexamer usage bias, and the fickett testcode statistic  <cit> . overall, 43% of the total midgut transcripts identified appeared to be long non-coding rna  . lncrna were less frequent in the annotated gene transcripts— <dig>  of  <dig>   , where most of them  were located within reference introns . the proportion of lncrnas is much higher,  <dig>  of  <dig>  , in nits and includes the following cufflinks classes: unknown genes , potential polymerase run-on , transcripts with repeats , and multiple classifications  .figure  <dig>

the an. gambiae midgut transcript models obtained   were functionally annotated by multiple blast analysis against  <dig> databases . we were able to annotate  <dig>   of them within a designated functional class  . of the transcripts without functional annotation, 13% were conserved  across several insect genus such as drosophila, aedes, and culex, but the rest appear to be exclusive to anophelines. we found that 20% of transcripts with a complete match to known reference transcripts  had no identifiable functional annotation, while within the potentially novel transcripts , the unknown function class increased to  <dig> %. the four most abundant functional classes were, in order of abundance, rna processing/transcription/translation; signal transduction, metabolism, and cytoskeletal/storage/secretion/extracellular matrix/adhesion . all functional classes presented potentially novel transcripts—in some cases in higher proportion than those previously annotated . the immunity class consisted of  <dig> transcripts;  <dig> of them were novel, and  <dig> had been previously annotated. of the novel transcripts,  <dig>  were new isoforms of previously annotated transcripts,  <dig> were potential pre-mrna transcripts,  <dig> had exonic overlaps to reference transcripts,  <dig> were exonic or intron overlaps to the opposite strand , and  <dig> were intergenic.

analysis of illumina reads using de novoassembly
a reference genome sequence is not available for many relevant insect vectors, and high-throughput transcriptome analysis can be very useful to begin to characterize candidate genes and develop new tools, such as microarrays, that would make it possible to assess broad transcriptional responses to specific physiologic conditions or experimental treatments. we carried out a de novo assembly of our reads, independent of the an. gambiae genome sequence, and compared the output of this strategy with the genome-based analysis using tophat/cufflinks as described. this alternative de novo assembly was also used as a complementary approach to identify new reads and maximize the discovery of novel transcripts.

the rna-seq reads for g <dig> and l3- <dig> were compiled together and put through an assembly by short sequences   <cit>  pipeline . the de novo strategy assembled  <dig>  contigs of which  <dig>   aligned to the an. gambiae genome  . of the  <dig>  de novo contigs that did not align to the genome, 83% had matches to an apicomplexa protein database and are likely to be either p. berghei or p. falciparum transcripts, while 17% were neither an. gambiae nor apicomplexan sequences and probably represent transcripts from bacteria, mouse, or human cells from the blood meal.

overall, the de novo strategy generated more contigs, but they were shorter  than the genome-based assembled transcripts . this strategy was able to detect 98% of the transcripts from annotated reference genes detected by the genome-based strategy and detected  <dig> additional transcripts from reference genes. when we compared the transcripts predicted from both methods, 59% of de novo transcripts aligned with transcripts obtained with the genome-based strategy, while 74% of the transcripts obtained with the genome-based analysis aligned with transcripts from the de novo assembly  . it is important to keep in mind that for the genome-based analysis only transcripts with fpkm >  <dig> were included in this comparison, and we know that up to 78% of transcripts with low read coverage  could be validated by qrt-pcr. in other words, several transcripts with low expression were probably eliminated when we established this quality threshold for the transcripts predicted using the genome-based methodology.figure  <dig>

variant analysis
the g <dig> and l3- <dig> an. gambiae midgut transcript reads were preprocessed using picard, and sequence polymorphisms or variants were discovered and annotated using the genome analysis toolkit  and a program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms  . overall,  <dig>  variants were detected with respect to the genome  of the pink-eyed laboratory strain  of an. gambiae. of these  <dig>  were not reported in the dbsnp database  and are therefore potential new variants. the an. gambiae g <dig> and l3- <dig> strains presented  <dig>  and  <dig>  variants with respect to the reference genome, respectively . the an. gambiae g <dig> and l3- <dig> strains shared  <dig>  of the variants. the g <dig> strain has  <dig> variant every  <dig>  bp while the l3- <dig> strain has  <dig> variant every  <dig>  bp. the l3- <dig> strain was selected from the g <dig> an. gambiae strain for refractoriness to plasmodium cynomolgi
 <cit>  and is therefore expected to have less diversity than the parental g <dig> strain.figure  <dig>

variants found in the transcriptome were distributed along the three an. gambiae chromosomes, with higher frequency toward telomeres and lower frequency toward centromeres . annotation of the an. gambiae transcriptome variants showed that  <dig>   are located in intergenic regions of the annotated reference genome , and many of them are probably present in non-coding rnas that tolerate more variation than coding rnas. intergenic transcripts have a higher level of variation  than transcripts from annotated genes . snps were frequently found in synonymous coding sequences , 3’ untranslated regions , and intronic regions   that are predicted not to affect the amino acid sequence of the translated products. we also identified  <dig>   snps predicted to change the encoded proteins. they either introduce a new start or stop codon, insert or delete a codon, a frame shift—by generating a novel donor or acceptor splice site, or result in loss of a start or stop codon . non-synonymous variants were found in most functional gene classes including genes involved in general metabolism, cytoskeletal structure, and extracellular matrix formation .figure  <dig>

discussion
we report the assembled high-throughput transcriptome of the an. gambiae midgut. a total of  <dig>  unique transcripts expressed in the an. gambiae midgut were detected. the number of potential novel transcripts identified  is surprising, as it doubles the number of transcripts currently reported in the whole genome database . of these potential novel transcripts,  <dig> % align partially to reference genome transcripts and represent new isoforms of  <dig>  known genes; while the other  <dig> % map to intergenic regions of the annotated genome  and define  <dig>  novel genes. we present several lines of evidence that confirm the existence of a good portion of the nits. first, 40% of them have highly homologous sequences in either the an. gambiae est database or the diptera database, indicating that similar transcripts have been previously found. second, rt-pcr testing confirmed expression of 84% of transcripts, and sequencing confirmed 84% of novel splice junction. previous reports have shown that microarrays are less sensitive and often unable to detect low abundant transcripts  <cit> , and some predicted transcripts may only be expressed in midguts from plasmodium-infected mosquitoes. in spite of these limitations, we were able to confirm expression of ~ <dig> nits, 39% of a subset of  <dig>  novel transcripts tested in a microarray analysis of midgut mrna expression in females fed uninfected blood. together, these data provide strong evidence that most of the novel transcripts reported are real and of high quality.

interestingly, the protein coding probability analysis indicated that a large portion of the transcripts detected  appear to be lncrna . in fact, most of the nits  appear to be lncrna, compared with 21% of the transcripts from annotated genes ; however, 82% of the nits contain orfs at least  <dig> amino acids long, suggesting that some transcripts could code for short peptides. functional annotation of the nits done by blast revealed that  <dig> % of them do not have homology to any functional database. this percentage is significantly higher than the 20% of unknown function in the previously annotated transcripts. the larger percentage of unknown function within the nits suggests that some of these transcripts may be unique to anophelines. our finding of a large number of new transcripts and noncoding rna in an. gambiae is consistent with some of the main findings of the encode project  <cit> . this project identified  <dig>  novel transcripts in intergenic or antisense regions of the reference human genome, based on sequences from human cell lines, and increased the number of annotated transcripts by 45%. moreover,  <dig>  polyadenylated lncrnas were found in genic regions of the human genome  <cit> . it appears that a large portion of the eukaryotic genome is transcribed, and while previous efforts have focused on short non-coding rna, the function of most of the newly discovered lncrna is still unclear  <cit> . recent reports indicate that lncrnas are involved in diverse biologic functions, such as chromosome x inactivation in females  <cit>  and regulation of inflammatory responses  <cit> . our detection of a large number of new transcripts is also consistent with a previous rna-seq analysis of transcriptional differences between chemosensory organs and whole body an. gambiae, in which only  <dig> % of the reads mapped to annotated genes in the agamp <dig>  genome  <cit> .

the de novo strategy assembled  <dig>  unique contigs, and  <dig>   of them mapped to the an. gambiae genome. the number of transcripts found in the de novo strategy is in the same order of magnitude of transcripts reported  for a sugar-fed male and female an. gambiae transcriptome by rna-seq assembled also with a de novo strategy  <cit> . the genome-based strategy used here produced less fragmented models that were on average three times longer than those from the de novo strategy . the genome-based analysis carried out with tophat/cufflinks can build transcript-spanning non-overlapping reads if there is a reference transcript; this generates larger and less fragmented transcripts  <cit> . because the de novo strategy does not require a reference genome for contig assembly, it would still generate contigs in regions where genomic scaffolds may be missing in poorly sequenced or partially assembled genomes. the de novo assembly also has the advantage that it does not require a reference genome and is able to find most of the transcripts generated by the genome-based analysis. there were  <dig> transposable element  transcripts in the rnaseq de novo assembly that were identified using a rps-blast search against a compiled database of mosquito te's from pfam and repbase . in particular, long stretches  were found for several jockey, copia and outcast elements. transcripts coding for near full-length transposases of class ii elements of the mariner, gambol and pif elements were also found. most of them appear to be functional genes, as they did not contain stop codons that are often found in pseudogenes. the presence of these transcripts could indicate active transposition of elements in a. gambiae. alternatively, they could code for reverse-complement transcripts and represent te suppression elements. we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities, because the libraries were not directional.

the variant analysis done in the an. gambiae midgut transcriptome identified  <dig>  variants of which  <dig> % are novel with respect to the snp database. this shows the power of rna-seq in finding variants and also the high level of polymorphism even within an an. gambiae lab colony. a large portion of the variants were found in transcripts that are intergenic with respect to the reference genome, and this class of transcripts have a higher frequency of variants  compared with genic transcripts , probably due to the higher frequency of non-coding rnas that are expected to tolerate more variations than protein-coding transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
the novel midgut transcripts presented here considerably expand the known an. gambiae transcriptome. this study sheds light on both coding and polyadenylated non-coding rnas and their variants, making a significant contribution to the an. gambiae genome annotation by doubling the number of known transcripts and tripling the number of variants. identification and sequence information for many lncrnas and other novel transcripts opens the possibility to study their transcriptional responses and begin to explore their biologic function in an. gambiae using functional assays such as dsrna gene silencing.
