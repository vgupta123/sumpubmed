BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas  in bacteria is now recognized as an important regulatory mechanism modulating a wide range of physiological responses  <cit> . while a few bacterial srnas were known for quite some time, their prevalence and importance were not initially appreciated. in recent years impressive technical advances have led to the prediction and/or characterization of many novel srnas in various bacteria  <cit> . in escherichia coli alone close to hundred srnas have been verified and new studies using deep sequencing of cdnas  in vibrio cholerae suggested the number of srnas to be several hundred  <cit> . even in low-gc gram-positive bacteria, where relatively few srnas had been detected  <cit> , the numbers are steadily increasing  <cit> .

in streptococci, information regarding srnas is so far restricted to two streptococcal species. three srnas, fasx  <cit> , pel  <cit> , and rivx  <cit> , have been detected serendipitously in streptococcus pyogenes. a genome-wide study using tiling microarray and northern analysis added fourteen srnas in this organism  <cit> .

in streptococcus pneumoniae, the first srnas to be described in this bacterium were found in the regulon of the two-component regulatory system  ciarh  <cit> . these srnas, designated csrnas , are transcribed from the five strongest promoters of the ciarh regulon. they show a high degree of similarity to each other, especially in the unpaired region between the two stem-loop structures characteristic for these srnas. complementarity to the shine-dalgarno   <cit>  sequence and the start codon aug within this unpaired region suggested that the csrna could control translation initiation of mrnas. more recently, nine additional srna have been detected in s. pneumoniae d <dig>  but their regulation has not been studied in greater detail  <cit> . a tiling array approach using rna from s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> suggested the existence of  <dig> srnas, but none was validated by northern blot analysis  <cit> . while the d <dig> work identified only csrna <dig>  all five csrnas were detected in tigr <dig>  both studies produced relatively few common srnas indicating a need for more efficient prediction methods.

the tcs ciarh had been identified in a screen aimed at isolating spontaneous mutants of s. pneumoniae resistant to cefotaxime  <cit> . besides Î²-lactam resistance, ciarh affects lytic processes, genetic competence, bacteriocin production, and virulence  <cit> . transcriptional mapping, in vitro ciar binding, and in vivo expression studies, identified a direct repeat sequence, tttaag-n5-tttaag, to be essential for ciar-mediated gene regulation  <cit> . the response regulator ciar in s. pneumoniae controls  <dig> promoters leading to the expression of  <dig> genes, which are organized in  <dig> operons and  <dig> monocistronic transcriptional units.

ciarh is also found in other streptococcal species and a number of studies have been performed aimed at elucidating the role of ciarh in these organisms. in streptococcus mutans, the system is involved in bacteriocin production, competence regulation, biofilm formation, and tolerance to environmental stresses  <cit> . stress tolerance is also affected in ciarh mutants of streptococcus gordonii  <cit> . in streptococcus agalactiae, intracellular survival and resistance to innate immunity defenses are diminished in ciar-deficient strains  <cit> . transcriptome studies using microarrays in s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes revealed genes regulated by the ciarh tcs, but no overlap with the well defined ciar regulon of s. pneumoniae was detected  <cit> . in s. mutans however, expression of htra, encoding a serine protease and one of the genes most strongly regulated by ciar in s. pneumoniae, is upregulated in a ciah mutant strain  <cit> . in most of these streptococci the binding site for ciar has not been identified and the genes directly controlled by ciar are still not known. most recently, the ciar binding site in s. mutans has been defined to be nttaag-n5-wttaag  <cit> , which is in perfect agreement with the one determined for s. pneumoniae.

in the present communication, we set out to determine whether genes for small non-coding rnas are always part of the ciar regulon in streptococci. predictions of such srna genes were made for those streptococcal species whose complete genome sequences were available. to validate these predictions, expression of csrnas in streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and from a streptococcus thermophilus plasmid was tested by northern blot analysis. the results of these experiments strongly suggest that genes for srnas are contained in all ciar regulons of streptococci.

RESULTS
conservation of the response regulator ciar in streptococcal species
the two-component regulatory system ciarh is present in all streptococcal species but is apparently not found in other bacteria. searches using the histidine kinase ciah of s. pneumoniae or its extracytoplasmic sensor domain identified homologues in streptococci but not in other groups of gram-positive bacteria such as bacillus, listeria, staphylococcus, lactobacillus, or lactococcus  <cit> . the streptococcal ciah kinase proteins share between  <dig> and 86% identical residues . the cognate response regulators, however, are much more similar showing between  <dig> and 99% identities . ciar belongs to the ompr family of winged-helix transcription factors interacting with dna by the recognition helix and the wings  <cit> . the recognition helix contacts particular dna bases in the major groove and is thus determining the sequence specificity. the recognition helix of ciar, positioned from aa  <dig> to  <dig> in the s. pneumoniae protein, is extremely conserved among all streptococcal ciar response regulators . only valine to isoleucine replacements are detected at two positions suggesting that all ciar regulators could bind to very similar dna sequences. from these considerations we concluded that ciar response regulators from streptococci should also bind to the sequence tttaag-n5- tttaag as determined for ciar from s. pneumoniae  <cit> .

a,b similarity is given in% identical residues of s. pneumoniae r <dig> ciar and ciah, respectively.

c the ciar recognition helix was identified according to the ompr family comparison defining dna binding sites  <cit> .

d the recognition helix of s. pneumoniae r <dig> ciar is shown for comparison. residues deviating from ciar r <dig> are underlined.

e ciar is interupted by a stop codon and was artificially fused for comparison. ciah is interrupted by two frame shifts and was artificially fused for comparison.

the ciarh genes in s. thermophilus are apparently not functional. in all s. thermophilus genome sequences available at the moment, ciar is interrupted by a stop codon, while translation of full length ciah is prevented by two frame shifts. a functional ciarh system may not be necessary in s. thermophilus due to its adaptation to the dairy niche, which appears to be mainly achieved by loss-of-function mutations  <cit> .

prediction of csrnas in streptococci other than s. pneumoniae
to determine whether genes for csrnas are present in other streptococcal species blast searches  <cit>  of the nucleotide collection  data base were performed using the five pneumococcal csrnas as query. the complete set of csrna genes was detected in all s. pneumoniae genomes. several hits were also obtained in whole genome sequences of streptococcal species other than s. pneumoniae, some of which representing most likely full-length csrna genes, but most of the hits covered far less than 50% of the query. in addition, limited similarity to csrnas was also detected in mobile dna elements such as streptococcal phages or an s. thermophilus plasmid.

from these analyses it appeared likely that at least some csrnas genes are present in streptococcal genomes, but the significance of short stretches of csrna similarity was not clear. they could indicate more diverse csrnas, much shorter versions or remnants of csrnas, or they could be obtained simply by chance. to distinguish these possibilities, the presence of ciar-controlled promoters should be indicative. these promoters should be located in intergenic regions and be followed by transcriptional terminators. therefore, such arrangements were searched in selected streptococcal genome sequences and sequence entries showing limited similarity to csrna genes mentioned above. for whole genomes, one strain of each species available from the ncbi microbial genome database was chosen for analysis and two genome sequences of oral streptococci recently completed in our laboratory were also included. in total,  <dig> streptococcal genomes were searched revealing the presence of  <dig> candidates for csrna genes , four csrna genes on average per streptococcal species. while for three species, s. sanguinis, s. gallolyticus, and s. gordonii, six csrna genes were predicted, s. equi subsp. equi apparently harbors only two. three additional csrna genes were predicted in other genbank entries, two in s. mitis and one on plasmid pst <dig> from s. thermophilus.  <cit>  these analyses also revealed that a number of shorter hits were not significant.

a the sequences used for the searches have the following accession numbers: s. mitis b <dig> ; s. oralis uo <dig> ; s. sanguinis sk <dig> ;s. agalactiae nem <dig> ; s. dysgalactiae subsp.equisimilus ggs_ <dig> ; s. equi subsp. equi  <dig> ; s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus mgsc <dig> ; s. gallolyticus ucn <dig> ; s. gordonii str. challis substr. ch <dig> ; s. mutans ua <dig> ; s. pyogenes mgas <dig> ; s. suis 05zyh <dig> ; s. uberis 0140j ; s. thermophilus cnrz <dig> ; s. thermophilus st <dig> plasmid pst <dig> ; s. mitis sf <dig> .

b csrnas are considered the same type if at least 80% of the residues are identical with consecutive insertions/deletions of less than three nucleotides. if the same type is present in one strain, the csrnas are designated - <dig> and - <dig>  respectively.

c size is given in nucleotides assuming the transcriptional start seven bases downstream of the - <dig> region and the last u of the transcriptional terminator as the stop site.

d csrna gene is truncated by an insertion sequence.

for s. agalactiae, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. mutans, s. pyogenes, and s. thermophilus the genome sequences of more than one strain are available. to determine if the newly identified csrna genes listed in table  <dig> are also present in these strains, blast searches were performed. all csrna genes defined in one strain of a streptococcal species are detected in the other strains with one exception. the gene for csrna <dig> of s. pyogenes mgas <dig> was only found in four out of thirteen s. pyogenes strains, but an identical copy is contained in s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilus ggs_ <dig> .

comparisons of the csrna genes among each other revealed a complex picture. short stretches of conserved sequences are present in all genes, but overall a surprising diversity was observed. if a gene showed 80% identity to another one and had no insertions/deletions of more than three consecutive nucleotides, the two genes were considered to specify the same rna. applying these criteria, genes for  <dig> different csrna types were predicted, which varied in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nt. secondary structure predictions revealed  <dig> csrnas exhibiting two stem-loop structures similar to the csrnas known from s. pneumoniae,  <dig> with only the termination stem-loop, and  <dig> with more complex structures . in all csrnas, sequences are present that could potentially base pair to translation initiation regions of mrnas.

corresponding to the great variety of csrna sequences, the genomic locations of csrna genes are also variable. as an example, the ruvb-upps region of s. pneumoniae is shown in figure  <dig> harboring csrna genes for csrna <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in s. mitis b <dig>  this region including csrna genes is conserved but disrupted by insertion elements. in s. oralis uo <dig>  csrna <dig> is found instead of csrna <dig>  s. sanguinis sk <dig> still harbors three csrna genes, but csrna <dig> replaces csrna <dig>  the other species, s. gordonii ch <dig>  s. gallolyticus ucn <dig>  s. suis 05zyh <dig>  and s. uberis 0140j have only one csrna gene at variable positions and orientations. the other streptococcal species listed in table  <dig> do not harbor csrna genes at this locus. the amazingly variable genetic context of csrna genes is consistent with the proposed role of the csrnas as trans-acting post-transcriptional effectors.

detection of csrnas in s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis
to validate the csrna gene predictions by northern blot analysis, three streptococcal species, s. mitis b <dig>  s. oralis uo <dig>  and s. sanguinis sk <dig> were chosen. the strains were grown in c-medium to the end of exponential growth phase, conditions applied to detect csrnas in s. pneumoniae  <cit> . total rna was extracted and separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. digoxigenin labeled probes were designed to detect single csrna types in each strain. as shown in figure  <dig>  all predicted csrnas could be verified in these northern analyses. while s. mitis b <dig>  and s. oralis uo <dig>  expressed five csrnas, s. sanguinis produced even six of them . three new csrna types were detected, one in s. oralis  and two in s. sanguinis . the csrnas showed the anticipated sizes indicating that the assumed starts and ends were correct. in virtually all cases more than one band was detected with one csrna probe, which is due to termination of transcription at several positions within the poly stretches, as demonstrated also for the csrnas of s. pneumoniae  <cit> . the results of these northern analyses expand the experimentally proven csrna types to eight.

since s. oralis is readily transformable, a ciar mutant strain was created by integrating a resistance marker into the gene. subsequently, northern blot analysis was performed to examine csrna expression in the ciar mutant strain. using probes for all s. oralis csrnas, no signal was detectable in the ciar-deficient mutant . this result clearly demonstrates the dependence of csrna expression on a functional ciar response regulator.

expression of a csrna gene from plasmid pst0
s. thermophilus appears to be unique among streptococci, since its ciarh system is inactivated by mutations. the ciarh genes in the three sequenced s. thermophilus strains cnrz <dig>  lmg <dig>  and lmd <dig> harbor three identical mutations. interestingly, a plasmid of another s. thermophilus strain st <dig> contained a csrna gene on a plasmid designated pst <dig>  <cit>  since this gene was the only one of the predicted csrna genes that is not located in the genome and the small rna represented a new type with only one stem-loop structure , we wanted to test its expression. to determine the status of the ciarh system in that strain, the ciarh region of s. thermophilus st <dig> was amplified and sequenced. the same three mutations known from s. thermophilus whole genome sequences inactivating both cia genes were detected. accordingly, using a csrna9-specific probe did not reveal a signal on northern blots using rna purified from s. thermophilus st <dig> . to provide a functional ciarh system for csrna <dig> expression, the gene, designated ccni, was amplified from plasmid pst <dig> and cloned into the s. pneumoniae integration vector pmrt2- <dig>  <cit>  as described in the methods section. the resulting plasmid pmrt-ccni was transferred to the s. pneumoniae strain rk <dig> expressing no csrnas  <cit> . integration of ccni occurred in the bgaa locus by double cross-over. rna purified from that strain  was subjected to northern blot analysis using a csrna9-specific probe. as shown in figure 6d, a band smaller than  <dig> nt was detected corresponding to the csrna <dig> of  <dig> bp. thus, ccni is indeed expressed when a functional ciarh system is provided. consequently, introduction of ccni into a ciar-deficient strain  did not result in csrna <dig> production . it is curious that although the ciarh system is inactive in s. thermophilus, targets such as csrna genes have still all necessary expression signals.

discussion
by searching data base entries with the consensus sequence for ciar-activated promoters,  <dig> genes for csrnas were predicted in  <dig> streptococcal species.  <dig> of these predictions were verified by visualizing csrnas from s. mitis b <dig>  s oralis uo <dig>  s. sanguinis sk <dig>  and s. thermophilus plasmid pst <dig> on northern blots. in addition, a recent genome-wide analysis of srnas in s. pyogenes  <cit>  identified two srnas in strain mgas <dig>  which are in fact controlled by ciar. these srnas, sr <dig> and sr <dig>  correspond to our predicted csrna <dig> and csrna <dig>  respectively. their experimentally determined transcriptional start points match exactly the predicted ones for csrna <dig> and csrna <dig>  since the gene for csrna <dig> is missing in mgas <dig>  csrna <dig> could not be detected in the study by perez et al.  <cit> . the small rna search in s. pyogenes and our work identified almost one third of the predicted csrnas strongly suggesting that small rnas controlled by the response regulator ciar exist in all streptococci.

both csrnas in s. pyogenes are expressed in standard medium during exponential growth and are also detected in stationary phase. the same expression pattern was observed in s. pneumoniae  <cit>  as well as in s. mitis, s. oralis and s. sanguinis, the streptococcal species used in our study . it will be interesting to see if csrnas will be expressed under similar conditions in all streptococci.

together with the five csrnas originally detected in s. pneumoniae,  <dig> csrnas have been verified so far by northern blot analysis. their promoters were therefore used to derive a new consensus sequence for strongly ciar-activated promoters on a broader basis. to do so, a sequence logo was created by analyzing a multiple promoter sequence alignment by weblogo  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the repeat sequence tttaag is clearly visible, especially in the second part of the repeat. only the first t is variable, replaced only twice by a and c, respectively. the first t in the first repeat is far less conserved being present in only  <dig> promoters. in addition, the second t and the first a are slightly variable. in both repeats, the third t, the second a and the final g are invariable. thus, the ciar repeat consensus appears to be nttaag-n5-tttaag rather than tttaag-n5-tttaag as proposed earlier  <cit> . besides the conservation of the - <dig> region there is a c preferentially found immediately upstream of the transcription initiation site. the significance of this observation is not clear at the moment.

the majority of srnas characterized to date exert their regulatory function by base pairing to mrnas  <cit> . these srnas regulate translation and/or stability of target mrnas, in most cases negatively. quite often, access to the ribosome binding site is blocked by srna-mrna base pairing. the csrnas of s. pneumoniae and those characterized or predicted in this work show complementarity to translation initiation regions . they can potentially base pair with the shine-dalgarno  sequence  <cit>  including the following start codon . these anti-sd and anti-start codon sequences are located in unpaired regions of the csrnas . in  <dig> of the  <dig> csrnas, cau is found potentially serving as an anti-aug. in the remaining nine csrnas, anti-gug and anti-uug sequences are present. the anti-tir sequences in all csrnas strongly suggest that these srnas bind to mrnas to hinder access of ribosomes thereby blocking translation initiation. it will be interesting to determine and compare their molecular targets in diverse streptococcal species.

although the potentiality to target tirs of mrnas is a common feature of the csrnas, primary sequence conservation within the anti-tir regions is rather limited. in addition, overall similarity of the csrnas is poor. however, a short stretch of conserved nucleotides is found in almost all csrnas . sequences very similar to uccuaaa originally defined for the csrnas of closely related s. pneumoniae  <cit> , s. mitis, and s. oralis are present in all but four csrnas . comparing all sequences indicated that the last position in this nonamer is less conserved than anticipated from the s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis comparison. the nonamer is located immediately downstream of the first stem-loop or at the 5'-end of the csrnas . it is missing in csrna <dig> and, curiously, in all csrnas predicted in s. suis.

if blocking ribosome binding sites by anti-tir sequences would be the primary mode of action of the csrnas, the conserved sequence introduced above should have another function. a protein binding site would be an attractive hypothesis. the global post-transcriptional regulator hfq is a key factor in srna-mrna interaction and regulation especially in e. coli but also in quite a number of other bacteria  <cit> . in at-rich gram-positive bacteria however, a role of hfq in srna-mediated regulatory events is less obvious  <cit>  and was only recently demonstrated for the first time with one srna in listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . in addition, the hfq gene is apparently lacking in enterococci, lactococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci  <cit> . assuming that other protein could substitute for hfq in streptococci, the short conserved sequence in csrnas may be part of a binding site for this factor.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have demonstrated that small rnas predicted on the basis of a ciar binding site and an appropriately spaced - <dig> region, which is followed by a transcriptional terminator, are expressed in s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sanguinis and from plasmid pst <dig>  these data, together with published proof of expression of these srnas in s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, strongly suggest that genes for srnas belong to the regulon of the response regulator ciar in all streptococcal species. expression of the ciar-dependent csrnas and the associated post-transcriptional regulatory events may be the reason for the pleiotropic phenotypes caused by ciar-dependent control. elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of csrna regulation appears to be crucial to understand the role of ciar in streptococcal physiology. hence, the suggestion of s. gottesman to 'watch for small rnas in all your favourite regulatory circuits'  <cit>  is especially rewarding for the ciar regulon in streptococci.
