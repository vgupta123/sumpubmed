BACKGROUND
crops with improved traits are being developed by screening for mutations induced in candidate genes  <cit> . several methods have been used to screen plant populations mutagenized by chemicals such as ethyl methanesulfonate . ems-mutagenized tobacco lines, for example, were screened by sscp analysis  <cit> . tobacco genotypes with induced mutations in the nicotine n-demethylase gene  were identified that had dramatically reduced levels of nornicotine. tilling was used to screen ems-mutagenized lines of a wheat variety null for wx-b <dig>  one of three waxy homeologs involved in starch biosynthesis  <cit> . wheat genotypes with induced wx-a <dig> and wx-d <dig> mutations were detected and later crossed to produce wx-a1/wx-b1/wx-d <dig> grain with low amylose starch. a third mutation scanning method, high resolution melting , was used to identify tomato lines with ems-induced mutations in candidate genes regulating fruit quality and drought tolerance  <cit> .

modifications that improve screening throughput and sensitivity would expedite the screening of thousands of genotypes for natural or induced mutations. high-throughput capillary electrophoresis, for example, has facilitated mutation analysis by sscp  <cit>  and tilling  <cit> . the adaption of hrm for clinical screening of human disease genes has encouraged the development of improvements that make it more sensitive, user-friendly, and cost-efficient. we examined the application of two hrm modifications, cold-pcr  <cit>  and qmc-pcr  <cit> , to mutation screening of plant genes.

one approach to increasing hrm throughput is through the pooling of samples for analysis. gady et al.  <cit>  found that tomato lines could be reliably analyzed by hrm in pools of four genotypes, but 8-fold pooling increased the frequency of false negatives. hrm analysis of ems-mutagenized maize was conducted with 5-fold pooling  <cit> . hrm throughput can be important for medical diagnostics , but more often the issue is detecting mutations in cells that comprise a small fraction of an otherwise normal tissue sample  <cit> . increasing hrm sensitivity would improve mutation analysis of heterogeneous tissue samples, as well as pooled individuals.

cold-pcr is a pcr modification that increases the sensitivity of mutation screening by favoring the production of amplicons with a dna mismatch  <cit> . pcr is carried out with a denaturation temperature at which heteroduplexed dna is preferentially denatured and amplified. the sensitivity of mutation detection by surveyor®, a mismatch-specific endonuclease used in tilling, was increased by more than an order of magnitude through enrichment for variant sequences  <cit> . cold-pcr has been used in conjunction with hrm to identify genetic mutations as low as  <dig> % in a wild-type dna background  <cit> . we examined whether cold-pcr could be used to increase the sample pooling depth of hrm analysis.

alternatively, the efficiency of mutation analysis could be increased by modifications in dna template production from large populations. techniques such as neattill  <cit>  and qmc-pcr  <cit>  expedite dna template preparation. qmc-pcr was developed to improve hrm analysis of mutations in dna of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, which is subject to dna degradation and crosslinking. with qmc-pcr, an initial multiplex reaction produces templates that are used in secondary reactions with nested primers to amplify multiple regions per template. for detecting mutations in a background of wild-type dna, qmc-pcr was demonstrated to be as sensitive as cold-pcr and eight-fold more sensitive than sanger sequencing  <cit> . to examine this approach, we tested the effect of genomic dna template levels on hrm of an initial pcr amplicon and its product from a second pcr reaction with nested primers.

as an experimental system, we targeted two genes that regulate flowering in peach, prunus persica. peach orthologs of agamous  and terminal flower  <dig>  have been characterized and genomic sequence data are available  <cit> . the  <dig> release of the draft genome sequence of peach  will facilitate new gene discovery. functional and translational genomics in peach, however, are limited by its recalcitrance to genetic transformation. peach is a candidate for targeted mutation breeding because of its compact diploid genome , self-compatibility, and short juvenile stage  for a woody plant. in this study, peach cultivars from a southeastern us breeding program were screened by hrm for natural polymorphism in ppag and pptfl <dig>  using single-nucleotide polymorphisms  identified in these genes, two approaches to improve hrm throughput were then examined:  increasing sample pooling and  using pcr products as templates for further pcr and hrm analysis.

RESULTS
hrm detection of snps in peach floral genes
exons of pptfl <dig> and ppag were identified by alignment of genomic and cdna sequences, and primer sets were developed that amplified exon regions . genomic dna isolated from  <dig> peach cultivars was pooled two-dimensionally in groups of six . in addition to increasing throughput, sample pooling facilitated the detection of homozygous mutations by providing wild-type dna for mismatch production. pcr and hrm were performed with a lightcycler  <dig> . the dna melting data were analyzed by lc <dig> gene scanning software  which, after data normalization and temperature-shifting, grouped cultivars with similar melting patterns using a proprietary algorithm.

hrm analysis of pptfl <dig> exons  <dig> and  <dig> found no differences in dna melting profiles among the  <dig> pools . in contrast, four pools exhibited altered dna melting profiles when an amplicon spanning exons  <dig> and  <dig> was analyzed . the four cultivars in common between these pools were examined independently, and three of them were found to have melting profiles that indicated a dna mismatch . dna sequencing demonstrated that cultivars  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had a similar polymorphism  in pptfl <dig> exon  <dig> and that cultivar  <dig> was wild-type . cultivar  <dig> had a homozygous snp at this position, whereas cultivars  <dig> and  <dig> had heterozygous snps. cultivar  <dig> grouped separately from the other snp-containing lines due to a greater melting curve change likely caused by both pptfl <dig> alleles forming mismatches at position  <dig> 

the dna sequence of pptfl <dig> exon  <dig> in cultivars  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> was found to be identical . the sequencing of pptfl <dig> exons  <dig> and  <dig> in five other cultivars with wild-type hrm profiles found no polymorphism in this region . all pools without cultivars  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had similar wild-type hrm patterns for this region . each pptfl <dig> exon of all  <dig> peach cultivars was also examined individually by hrm and no snps were detected beyond those identified in pooled samples . these results show that a single polymorphic site  in the pptfl <dig> coding region could be detected by hrm and that  <dig> of  <dig> cultivars contained this snp.

the eight translated exons of ppag were examined in six corresponding pcr amplicons ranging between 310- <dig> bp . analysis of the amplicon spanning exons  <dig> and  <dig> identified six pools with altered melting profiles , which contained  <dig> cultivars in common. when examined individually, four cultivars had melting profiles indicating a polymorphism . this was confirmed by sequencing, which found that all four cultivars were heterozygous for a snp in exon  <dig> . pools containing two cultivars with the ppag snp  grouped separately from pools with one snp and no snps. the other five amplicons covering the ppag coding region exhibited no dna melting differences among the  <dig> cultivars . table  <dig> summarizes the snps discovered in exons of ppag and pptfl <dig>  no cultivar contained snps in both genes. for both genes, the snps resulted in synonymous mutations.

corresponding nucleotides at the polymorphic site of each allele are shown. the consensus nucleotide at pptfl <dig> position  <dig> was based on sequenced amplicons of nine cultivars with melting profiles similar to  <dig> other cultivars. the consensus nucleotide at ppag position  <dig> was based on sequenced amplicons of three cultivars with melting profiles similar to  <dig> other cultivars.

hrm analysis of pooled samples using standard pcr and cold-pcr
genotypes with polymorphisms in ppag or pptfl <dig> were detected in dna pooled from six peach cultivars. we examined whether the snps could be identified in sample pools that were two or three times as large. cultivar  <dig>  and cultivar  <dig>  were each pooled in groups of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> genotypes with cultivars found to be wild-type for the gene examined. for both genes, the lc <dig> gene scanning software distinguished the three pools containing a snp from a pool of cultivars with wild-type sequence . however, the three snp-containing pools were not distinguished from each other. amplicons over  <dig> bp affected the repeatability of snp detection at a 1: <dig> dilution, but not 1: <dig> or 1: <dig> dilutions . these data indicate that increasing the pool size to  <dig> genotypes is feasible in peach.

the use of cold-pcr to preferentially amplify mismatched dna was examined as a means to increase the sensitivity of hrm analysis of pooled samples. the tm of amplicons spanning the snps was determined by lc <dig> gene scanning software to be  <dig> °c for pptfl <dig> and  <dig> °c for ppag. the critical temperature  for cold-pcr was optimized using a range of denaturation temperatures approximately 1°c less than the tm of the amplicon. cold-pcr with a tc of  <dig> °c for pptfl <dig> and  <dig> °c for ppag resulted in the enrichment of pcr amplicons with dna mismatches . for both genes, the sensitivity of detection of snps in pooled samples increased relative to the snp-containing cultivar alone . after cold-pcr, the lc <dig> gene scanning software could distinguish the melting profile of snps in the 1: <dig> pool  from the larger pools. cold-pcr results were consistent with amplicons of less than  <dig> bp , but not with the amplicons over  <dig> bp that were tested .

effect of dna template quantity and quality on hrm analysis
two important features of qmc-pcr are  the production of initial pcr products from genomic template of varying availability and  the use of a resulting pcr product as template for analysis of multiple dna regions with nested primers.

a 10-fold difference in genomic template was first examined using genotypes with  and without  a snp in tfl <dig> exon  <dig>  hrm results were similar for template levels of  <dig> and  <dig> ng when these cultivars were analyzed separately and together .

pcr products from the experiment described above were used as template for an internal region amplified with nested primers. the hrm results were similar to those obtained with genomic dna, except that the melting temperature of the shorter amplicon was lower by approximately  <dig> °c . these results showed that a pcr product can be used as template for hrm and that a 10-fold difference in initial template concentration did not affect snp detection. techniques like qmc-pcr that mitigate variation in template quantity and quality could simplify dna isolation from large plant populations.

discussion
hrm analysis of pptfl <dig> and ppag alleles of  <dig> peach cultivars found one polymorphic site in the coding region of each gene. seven cultivars with snps were identified while screening  <dig> bp of sequence per genotype. wild-type melting profiles from individual and pooled samples corresponded with the sequencing results of  <dig> amplicons, making it unlikely that there are additional snps in pptfl <dig> and ppag exons. a comparison of the complete pptfl <dig> genomic sequence of peach cultivars lovell and nemared found an ssr variation in intron  <dig>  but no polymorphism in exon sequence  <cit> .

in contrast to peach, hrm analysis of  <dig> cultivars of almond  detected numerous snps in coding sequences, with an average frequency of 1: <dig> bp  <cit> . in olive , an outcrossing species like almond, variation in a  <dig> bp region of phya was examined by hrm  <cit> . sixteen of  <dig> olive cultivars had snps at one or two polymorphic sites within this region. the low level of genetic variability observed in pptfl <dig> and ppag may be a consequence of self-compatibility in peach and the narrow genetic base of cultivars bred for the eastern us  <cit> . additionally, there may be selection against coding region mutations in pptfl <dig> and ppag, which are single genes in peach  <cit> .

pptfl <dig> and ppag snps were used to examine approaches to increase hrm throughput. following standard pcr of dna pools of twelve cultivars, hrm analysis consistently identified pools with a snp-containing cultivar. this pool size is larger than previously reported pools of four or five genotypes  <cit> , possibly due to differences in instrumentation or genome size. hrm can detect a variant sequence diluted in wild-type dna at ratios up to 1: <dig>  <cit> . hrm sensitivity, however, is lower with pooled dna from different individuals than for a variant sequence diluted with dna from a single source  <cit> .

cold-pcr increased the sensitivity of hrm analysis of pooled samples for pptfl <dig> and ppag snps. after cold-pcr, melting profiles of pooled samples more closely resembled the melting profile of an individual snp-containing genotype, presumably through enrichment for the sequence variant. in dilution experiments, hrm with cold-pcr exhibited detection limits below 1%  <cit> . in this study, variant sequences comprising  <dig> % of the pooled dna were detected, although sample pools of more than  <dig> genotypes were not examined. cold-pcr may be more useful for genotyping than mutation scanning because of limitations on amplicon size. cold-pcr has been licensed for medical diagnostics and further research  may broaden the applicability of the technique.

hrm results were consistent for nested products produced from pcr-derived template, despite 10-fold differences in genomic template in the original pcr reaction. this suggests that an approach like qmc-pcr could reduce the need for highly purified dna from high throughput sample preparation. qmc-pcr captures variable levels of intact target regions in fixed archival tissue, where dna degradation is problematic  <cit> . dilution experiments with human dna found that qmc-pcr could detect variant sequences present at  <dig> % of a background of wild-type dna.

in contrast to qmc-pcr and cold-pcr, sanger sequencing does not detect mutations present at less than 20% of total dna  <cit> . next-generation sequencing, though, has considerable potential as a mutation screening tool when strategies to distinguish mutations from sequencing errors are employed and sample pooling is used to improve cost-efficiency  <cit> . roche  <dig> sequencing, for example, was used to identify ems-mutagenized candidate genes in pooled samples of tomato  <cit>  and petunia  <cit> . direct comparisons of pyrosequencing and cold-pcr or qmc-pcr-enhanced hrm found that the modified hrm analyses had an equal or lower limit of detection  <cit> . diagnostic methods like hrm that detect mismatched dna can be an alternative or complement to sequencing.

CONCLUSIONS
mutation scanning by hrm could identify snps in exons of ppag and pptfl <dig> in a small set of peach cultivars. cultivars with snps in these genes were used to determine that polymorphisms could be reliably detected in pools of twelve genotypes. cold-pcr was found to increase the sensitivity of hrm analysis of pooled samples, but worked best with small amplicons. examination of another hrm modification, qmc-pcr, demonstrated that primary pcr products for further analysis could be produced from variable levels of genomic dna, providing an approach for simplifying high-throughput dna isolation. technical advances developed to improve clinic-based mutation screening can play a role in the targeted mutation breeding of crops.
