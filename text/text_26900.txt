BACKGROUND
changes in the phenotype of cells  result from changes in gene expression. emphasis is often placed on rna expression, and the availability of microarray technology has enabled studies of the global transcriptome. however, gene expression is also influenced by the rate of translation into protein. the global rate of protein synthesis relates to the capacity for and efficiency of translation  <cit> . capacity is increased by synthesis of ribosomal subunits and other translational components, whereas efficiency is regulated by the rate of translational initiation , and the rate of peptide chain elongation. individual mrnas are subject to additional levels of translational regulation, and elements in their 5' and 3' untranslated regions  may interact with regulatory rnas  or rna binding proteins to modulate ribosomal association  <cit> . the 5' utr particularly influences the rate of initiation via 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts , inclusion of short upstream open reading frames , gc content and utr length  <cit> .

top mrnas possess 5- <dig> pyrimidines at the 5' end, usually starting with c  <cit> . they are subject to growth-associated translational regulation, and stimulation with serum increases their polysomal association. mrnas encoding ribosomal proteins, elongation factors and some subunits of eif3e initiation factor are all top mrnas  <cit> . recruitment to polysomes increases their rate of translation, thus increasing translational capacity. several studies have used microarrays to analyse rna recruitment to polysomes  <cit> , and bioinformatics approaches have been used to identify potential top mrnas  <cit> . however, the full panoply of top mrnas is not known and the extent to which translational regulation is mediated through top mrnas relative to other mechanisms  remains to be established. phosphoinositide 3' kinase , signaling through protein kinase b  and mammalian target of rapamycin , is particularly implicated in translational regulation  <cit> . mtor complex  <dig>  promotes phosphorylation  of p <dig> s <dig> kinases  that phosphorylate the small ribosomal subunit protein s <dig> , and this was proposed to promote translation of top mrnas. however, protein synthesis and recruitment of top mrnas to polysomes in the presence of serum is not inhibited in p70s6k-null cells  <cit> , and alternative mechanisms and signaling pathways may operate. for example, p <dig> ribosomal s <dig> kinases , activated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/ <dig> , also phosphorylate eif4b and eef2k  <cit> . additionally, the pathways are integrated and erk1/ <dig> can activate mtorc <dig> independently of pi3k  <cit> . in a global context, pi3k signaling also influences the global rate of translation by promoting phosphorylation of 4e-bp <dig>  <cit> . this promotes dissociation of 4e-bp <dig> from eif4e, allowing eif4e to bind to the 7-methylgtp cap of mrnas and increase the rate of initiation.

cardiomyocytes, the contractile cells of the heart, withdraw from the cell cycle perinatally. maturational growth of the heart results from an increase in cell size, but cardiomyocytes also hypertrophy in response to physiological stresses   <cit> . cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is manifested in increased cell size and sarcomeric content. this reflects underlying changes in gene/protein expression, resulting from alterations in the transcriptome coupled with an increase in the rate of protein synthesis. some would argue that the increased rate of protein synthesis is a crucial factor in facilitating hypertrophy  <cit> . various neurohumoral factors promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy including endothelin- <dig>  and other agonists that potently activate erk1/ <dig>  and erk1/ <dig> signaling is particularly implicated in promoting hypertrophy  <cit> . insulin is associated with cardiomyocyte growth since it increases the rate of cardiac protein synthesis  <cit>  and, as in other cells, insulin potently activates pkb/akt via pi3k in cardiomyocytes  <cit> . insulin activates erk1/ <dig> to a degree, but this is substantially less than that induced by et- <dig> and, although et- <dig> activates pkb/akt to a minor degree, this is substantially less than insulin  <cit> . notably, insulin does not induce the same hypertrophic phenotype as, for example, et- <dig>  and inhibition of erk1/ <dig> signaling, but not pi3k, attenuates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by hypertrophic agonists  <cit> . in hearts in vivo, pressure overload increases recruitment of rpl <dig> mrna  rather than non-top mrnas  suggesting that the top mrna mechanism is an integral part of cardiac hypertrophy  <cit> . similar effects are seen in feline cardiomyocytes with et- <dig> and insulin, both of which activate mtor. however, only a single top mrna was examined and whether this extends to other established top mrnas, or if there are additional top mrnas in the cardiac transcriptome is unknown.

previously, we reported the acute effects of et- <dig> on the cardiomyocyte transcriptome  <cit> , identifying  <dig> rnas as temporally-regulated over the first  <dig> h of stimulation. most of the protein-coding rnas are approximately equally changed in total and polysomal rna pools, suggesting that there is little translational regulation of these transcripts. here, we compare the changes induced by et- <dig> and insulin in the global cardiomyocyte transcriptome and in transcript recruitment to polysomes. unlike et- <dig>  insulin did not have a substantial effect on global transcript expression, but both agonists differentially affected rna recruitment to polysomes. furthermore, whilst insulin did promote recruitment of top rnas to the polysomes, not all recruited mrnas possessed a top sequence.

RESULTS
signaling through to protein synthesis by et- <dig> and insulin
to compare the effects of et- <dig> and insulin on activation of intracellular signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes, extracts were immunoblotted with antibodies selective for phosphorylated  forms of erk1/ <dig>  pkb/akt, mtor, p70s6k and rps <dig>  consistent with previous studies  <cit> , et- <dig>  potently activated erk1/ <dig> with little effect on pkb/akt whereas insulin  had little effect on erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, but potently activated pkb/akt . both agonists promoted phosphorylation of mtor, p70s6k and rps <dig> . although insulin consistently stimulated a greater increase in phospho-mtor than et- <dig>  this was not reflected in the degree of phosphorylation of p70s6k and rps <dig>  our previous studies demonstrated that 4e-bp <dig> exhibits significant phosphorylation in unstimulated cardiomyocytes, and the degree of phosphorylation is increased in response to insulin  <cit> . furthermore, insulin increases the association of eif4e with 7-methylgtp-sepharose and would thus be predicted to increase the rate of initiation of translation for the 7-methylgtp cap structure.

insulin or et- <dig> increases the rate of protein synthesis over the first  <dig> h of stimulation  <cit> . by pulse labelling with -phe for the final  <dig> h for periods up to  <dig> h, we established that there was little increase in the rate of protein synthesis over the first hour, but the rate increased significantly over the second hour with either insulin or et- <dig> and this was sustained for up to  <dig> h . inhibiting erk1/ <dig> signaling with pd <dig>  had no significant effect on baseline protein synthesis or the increase in the rate of protein synthesis induced by et- <dig> or insulin between  <dig> and  <dig> h . inhibiting pi3k signaling with  <dig> μm ly <dig>  <cit>   inhibited baseline protein synthesis to ~60% of control levels and inhibited the increase in protein synthesis induced by et- <dig> or insulin . consistent with our previous study over  <dig> h  <cit> , this suggests that pi3k plays a significant role in cardiomyocyte protein synthesis. rapamycin inhibited the phosphorylation of p70s6k , but had no significant effect on baseline protein synthesis. however, it did inhibit the increase induced by et- <dig> and attenuated the increase induced by insulin .

regulation of the global transcriptome by et- <dig> or insulin
previous studies demonstrated that almost all the changes induced by et- <dig> in the cardiomyocyte transcriptome at  <dig> h  represent immediate early genes  <cit> . here, we compared the effects of et- <dig>  with insulin  on the global transcriptome at  <dig> h. using the same criteria , expression of  <dig> and  <dig> probesets was significantly changed by et- <dig> or insulin, respectively . of rnas responsive to both agonists ,  <dig> were similarly upregulated and  <dig> similarly downregulated  and ), whereas  <dig> were upregulated to a greater extent by et- <dig> ). only  <dig> rnas  were selectively regulated by insulin  and ), whereas  <dig> rnas  were selectively regulated by et- <dig> . we previously focused on krüppel-like factors  to validate et-1-responsive changes  <cit> . we therefore validated the insulin microarray data for klfs by qpcr . consistent with the microarray data, insulin promoted transient increases in expression of klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> mrnas , with downregulation of klf <dig>  klf <dig> and klf <dig> mrnas . these data indicate that, although insulin does affect the global transcriptome, the response to et- <dig> is substantially greater with respect to relative levels and numbers of changes.

rna recruitment to cardiomyocyte polysomes
to study translational regulation, cardiomyocyte polysomes were prepared by sucrose density centrifugation  and rna extracted. equal amounts of labelled crna from total or polysomal pools were analysed using microarrays. initially, we studied the baseline differences between the total and polysomal rna profiles. polysomal rna profiles of unstimulated cells  were notably different from total rna profiles and, using raw fluorescence values, expression of  <dig> of the  <dig>  probesets detected was significantly different between the rna pools . given the range of non-protein coding rnas that exist, this may not necessarily be considered as surprising. however, of the top 10th percentile of detected probesets  that predominantly encode mrnas ,  <dig> probesets  were similarly expressed in total and polysomal rna pools , but  <dig> protein-coding mrnas  exhibited > <dig> -fold difference  in expression . differential expression did not correlate with raw fluorescence values , so the differences do not simply reflect excessive levels of expression or saturation of the microarray system. the data suggest that a significant proportion of constitutively expressed mrnas in cardiomyocytes are translationally regulated and, in serum-starved cells, there appears to be a reservoir in the total rna pool available for polysomal recruitment.

to identify rnas with the greatest degree of differential expression between total and polysomal rna pools, the data were normalised to the gene median. of rnas with substantial and significant differential expression ,  <dig> were non-protein coding rnas for sequences in introns, potential antisense sequences or probable microrna precursors  with a further  <dig> probesets for rnas associated with no established gene. as might be expected, virtually all  were preferentially detected in the total rna pool. of the  <dig> probesets encoding mrnas, only  <dig> were preferentially recruited to the polysomes. interestingly, the most disproportionately expressed mrnas encoded α-myosin heavy chain or β-myosin heavy chain, key myofibrillar proteins, both of which were preferentially detected in total rna. these data further suggest that cardiomyocytes possess a reservoir of mrnas.

translational regulation in cardiomyocytes by insulin or et-1
consistent with the effects on protein synthesis , insulin or et- <dig>  increased cardiomyocyte polysome content, as seen by the increase in a <dig> in heavier sedimenting fractions  and decrease in a <dig> in fractions 1- <dig> . polysomal and total rna profiles were generated by hybridisation of equal amounts of labelled crna to microarrays. to identify rnas subject to translational regulation by insulin or et- <dig>  the data for each rna pool were normalised to unstimulated controls and the relative change in each pool  was assessed independently. we subsequently compared the degree of change in total vs polysomal rna. thus, probesets were selected with > <dig> -fold change in total or polysomal rna relative to controls, and filtered on statistical significance . potential translationally-regulated rnas were then selected with statistically-significant changes only in polysomal rna  or only in total rna  and with expression ratio  > <dig> . we considered there was insufficient evidence for translational regulation of remaining rnas .

approximately 56% of insulin-responsive and ~35% of et-1-responsive transcripts were classed as group i rnas  or group ii rnas  . with respect to function, proteins associated with signaling/trafficking or transcriptional regulation, or rnas for hypothetical proteins or transcripts of no known function were prevalent in all groups . however, insulin particularly increased polysomal association of mrnas for proteins associated with protein synthesis , including top mrnas for  <dig> cytosolic ribosomal proteins, eif3f and eef1b <dig> . the top mrna for rpl <dig> was the only one to be decreased in cardiomyocyte polysomes in response to insulin. we validated the changes for two ribosomal protein mrnas, rps <dig> and rps <dig>  by qpcr, demonstrating selective upregulation in the polysomes in response to insulin. consistent with this, absolute levels of rps <dig> and rps <dig> proteins , and 18s and 28s rnas  were increased.

we identified all probesets for established top mrnas encoding ribosomal proteins, elongation factors and eif3e and eif3h  <cit> , and analysed the response to insulin. of  <dig> ribosomal protein mrnas, all but  <dig> were significantly increased in the insulin-responsive translatome and only  <dig>  were not upregulated to any degree . eif3e and eif3h mrnas were also significantly upregulated in the insulin-responsive translatome and, of the elongation factors, eef1b <dig> mrna was the only elongation factor mrna to be significantly upregulated . previous work suggests that et- <dig> also increases translation of top mrnas in feline cardiomyocytes as demonstrated by an increase in rpl <dig> mrna recruitment to polysomes  <cit> . our data indicated that et- <dig> did increase recruitment of mrnas for rpl <dig> and other ribosomal proteins to rat neonatal cardiomyocyte polysomes, but this was not as great as that induced by insulin, nor was it statistically significant .

informatics analysis of 5' utrs of mrnas recruited to polysomes in response to insulin
 <dig> of  <dig> rnas significantly upregulated by insulin in the translatome but not the transcriptome encoded established proteins,  <dig> of which were established top mrnas . this raises the question of how many other mrnas in this group also contain a top sequence. since few transcriptional start sites  have been mapped for the rat genome, we identified 5' utr sequences for mrnas for the mouse orthologs using the fantom <dig> cage  database with support from ncbi databases and the database of tsss . we then identified 5' sequences of rat mrnas  from the ncbi rat genome database to confirm sequence conservation between species. with this approach we identified 5' utr sequences for all but  <dig> mrnas  in the insulin-responsive cardiomyocyte translatome. all ribosomal protein mrnas identified were top mrnas , with a single exception, rpl7l <dig>  interestingly, even though rpl <dig> mrna was downregulated in the translatome the 5'utr contained a top sequence. of other established mrnas recruited to cardiomyocyte polysomes in response to insulin, eif3e, eif3f, eif3h, eef1b <dig>  gnb2l <dig>  and npm <dig> were verified as top mrnas .

we examined 5' utrs for other mrnas selectively recruited to cardiomyocyte polysomes by insulin. atg <dig>  atp5g <dig>  ccnj, cnih, gltscr <dig>  naca, pfdn <dig> and rbms <dig> were identified as probable top mrnas on the basis of the tss for mouse transcripts and homology with the rat genome . brpf <dig>  ilk, plekhh <dig>  snrpd <dig> and zfp <dig> mrnas were identified as potential top rnas although mouse and rat 5' utrs have less identity and not all start with c . we could not identify top sequences for  <dig> mrnas and, although most contain polypyrimidine tracts, uorfs, gc tracts or untranslated 5' exons within the 5' utr, there were no consistent features . a recent bioinformatics study identified an additional  <dig> potential top mrnas  <cit> . we mined our data for these, but only impdh <dig> and eif3e were significantly changed with another  <dig> being increased >10% albeit in the absence of statistical significance . the majority showed no change in expression in cardiomyocyte polysomes in response to insulin although, given the recruitment of ribosomal protein mrnas to cardiomyocyte polysomes, we are confident that a signaling pathway for regulation of top mrnas was operative.

total and polysomal rna from cardiomyocytes exposed to insulin  or unstimulated cardiomyocytes  were analysed using microarrays. probesets corresponding to mrnas with > <dig> -fold increase in expression  were identified. results are the mean fold change in insulin stimulated samples relative to controls. mouse and rat 5' utr sequences were identified. the top sequence is in bold italics. accession numbers are provided in additional data file  <dig> 

et- <dig> promoted some increase in recruitment to cardiomyocyte polysomes of mrnas encoding ribosomal proteins , suggesting there may be an effect on top mrnas. we therefore examined the 5' utr sequences of mrnas with significant and selective recruitment to cardiomyocyte polysomes in response to et- <dig> . of the  <dig> mrnas for which we could determine the potential tss,  <dig> were also regulated by insulin  but did not possess a top sequence, and there were no consistent features for the remaining  <dig> mrnas .

discussion
transcription vs translation in cardiomyocytes
most transcriptomics studies focus on global changes in rna expression in response to specific stimuli or in specific disease states. however, analysis of mrnas associated with polysomes provides further insight into translational regulation. studies in yeast  <cit> , transformed cancerous cells  <cit>  and primary t cells  <cit>  all suggest that, in steady-state  cells, there is disparity between global transcript expression and translation of specific mrnas. our data with unstimulated  cardiomyocytes  are consistent with this and, although many rnas in the global transcriptome are non-protein coding and may not necessarily be expected to be recruited to polysomes, over 30% of the most abundant cardiomyocyte mrnas were differentially expressed in global and polysomal pools . many of the most disproportionately expressed mrnas in the global rna pool encoded cytoskeletal/myofibrillar proteins. in response to hypertrophic stimulation, these may be rapidly recruited to polysomes for translation, thus initiating hypertrophic growth in the absence of further increases in transcript levels.

a further question relates to the degree of translational regulation following exposure to growth stimuli. since the relative effect on transcriptional vs translational regulation is likely to depend on the intracellular signaling pathways activated by specific stimuli, we compared et- <dig>  and insulin   <cit> . whereas et- <dig> drives a substantial response in the global transcriptome , a large proportion of which requires erk1/ <dig> signaling  <cit> , insulin had a relatively minor effect on global rna expression, suggesting that pi3k signaling through pkb/akt does not substantially affect transcription even though pkb/akt phosphorylates, for example, forkhead transcription factors that are then inactivated  <cit> . to gain insight into the insulin response and regulation of translation, it was necessary to examine smaller relative changes . this suggests that effects on translation of individual transcripts and of insulin generally are relatively subtle. interestingly, insulin had a greater translational effect on recruiting transcripts to polysomes rather than a bias away from the polysomes , whereas et- <dig> had a greater effect on downregulated transcripts that were preserved in the polysomal fraction . in interpreting the data from this study, it should be noted that  equal amounts of rna from total and polysomal pools were hybridized to the microarrays. given that the data normalization was to the values of unstimulated cells and that insulin and et- <dig> each increased the absolute amount of polysomal rna , it may be viewed that a greater number of cells were represented from the unstimulated samples compared with those from samples stimulated with insulin or et- <dig>  as a consequence, the degree by which transcripts were increased in polysomal rna by insulin or et- <dig> and the number of transcripts decreased in polysomal rna may have been underestimated. our analysis is therefore likely to be conservative in relation to both these aspects. nevertheless, since the criteria for analysis were identical for both agonists  and both promoted a similar increase in cardiomyocyte polysomes, the data reliably highlight the differential effects of insulin and et- <dig> on translational regulation in cardiomyocytes.

translational regulation by insulin and identification of top mrnas
it is almost  <dig> years since the top motif was identified in mammalian mrnas for ribosomal proteins  <cit> , and this is probably the most well-established feature of mrnas that are translationally regulated in response to nutrients or growth stimuli  <cit> . the best characterized top mrnas encode ribosomal proteins and, although others have been identified, most are associated with the translational apparatus  <cit> . the prevalence of top mrnas and the extent to which this mechanism accounts for translational regulation is still debated. since pi3k signaling and mtor are particularly implicated in the top mrna response  <cit> , we focused on the cardiomyocyte response to insulin. as expected, insulin increased recruitment of established top mrnas to cardiomyocyte polysomes. although we identified a few probable/possible top mrnas, we could find no evidence for top sequences for ~43% of mrnas we identified as significantly increased in the insulin-responsive cardiomyocyte translatome. there are problems in identifying tsss and many genes are not well-studied, so we cannot be certain that the latter group are not subject to alternative splicing or possess alternative promoters that may produce a 5' top sequence. however, the data suggest that there may not be many more top mrnas to be identified. the mrnas with no apparent top sequence possess a variety of features in the 5' utr that indicate potential for translational regulation. with no consistent features, further studies will need to focus on individual mrnas, first to confirm the 5' utr sequence and, assuming top sequences are not identified, to establish the mechanisms of regulation.

with the vast amount of genome sequence data available, it might be expected that identification of top mrnas should be relatively trivial but, even for human and mouse genomes, the tss is often not well-defined, partly because of alternative promoters and alternative splicing of non-protein-coding first exons. the bioinformatics approach of yamashita et al.  <cit>  utilised a database of tsss to define all potential top mrnas for the human genome. surprisingly, we found very few of these mrnas in our insulin-responsive pool of transcripts recruited to cardiomyocyte polysomes . yamashita et al. used a phorbol ester for experimental validation and demonstrated polysomal recruitment of  <dig> of  <dig> candidate top rnas tested. phorbol esters, like et- <dig>  potently activate erk1/ <dig> signaling in cardiomyocytes  <cit> , but we detected no preferential recruitment of the candidate top transcripts to cardiomyocyte polysomes in response to et- <dig> either . this perhaps highlights the necessity  for an experimentally driven approach.

protein kinase signaling and translational regulation
pi3k signaling and mtor are implicated in the regulation of top mrnas and mrna translation in general  <cit> . our data are consistent with this. thus, basal cardiomyocyte protein synthesis and pkb/akt phosphorylation  <cit> , was attenuated by inhibiting pi3k with ly <dig>  indicating that, even in the basal state, turnover of phosphatidylinositol  <dig> , <dig> trisphosphate plays an important maintenance role. furthermore, the increase in protein synthesis induced by et- <dig> or insulin was attenuated by ly <dig> or rapamycin . our aim was to highlight differential signaling by et- <dig> and insulin in relation to protein synthesis rather than dissect the involvement of signaling pathways in translational regulation per se. thus, et- <dig> potently activated erk1/ <dig> rather than pkb/akt whereas insulin activated pkb/akt rather than erk1/ <dig> , but the pathways appear to converge and either stimulus promoted phosphorylation of mtor, p70s6ks and rps <dig> . the data are consistent with studies in other cells that implicate erk1/ <dig> signaling in the regulation of mtor, p70s6ks and rps <dig> in addition to pi3k , and both et- <dig> and insulin promote phosphorylation of mtor in feline cardiomyocytes  <cit> . however, the significance of this for translational regulation of top mrnas or, indeed, translational regulation by any other mechanism is not clear.

regardless of the signaling mechanism, there was little similarity in the responses to et- <dig> and insulin, both with respect to the global transcriptome and the translatome . this contrasts with a study in feline cardiomyocytes suggesting that either stimulus promotes recruitment of top mrnas to polysomes for translation  <cit> . it should perhaps be considered that only rpl <dig> mrna was studied, as an example of a top mrna, and the global picture was not defined. in our study, et- <dig> did promote some increase in recruitment of top mrnas for ribosomal proteins to cardiomyocyte polysomes  but, overall, the response was less than that of insulin. potentially, the degree of the response correlates with the lesser activation of mtor by et- <dig> than insulin , but we have little understanding of the mtor signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes on which to base such a claim.

though outside the scope of this study, further work is clearly required to establish the mechanisms by which insulin or et- <dig> influence mrna recruitment to cardiomyocyte polysomes. given the likely importance of mtor and the discrepancies in the literature with respect to mtor regulation and sensitivity or otherwise to rapamycin  <cit> , perhaps the most immediate focus should be the rapamycin sensitivity  of polysomal recruitment of top vs non-top mrnas in the cardiomyocyte response to insulin or et- <dig>  however, more fundamental studies are also required simply to understand the pi3k signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes. some of the important questions to be addressed relate to compartmentalisation of signaling events to establish whether, for example, activation of pi3k and/or mtor by insulin is confined to a specific location and whether mtor activated by et- <dig> constitutes a distinct pool. such spatial organisation could explain differential effects of the two stimuli despite a similar global level of mtor activation. even more fundamentally, perhaps it is worth noting that although pkb/akt and mtor are well-established effectors of pi3k signalling and most studies use pkb/akt as an indicator of pi3k activation, pi3k is a family of enzymes with many lipid  substrates that seem likely to signal through a range of effectors. this area is largely uninvestigated in cardiomyocytes and is underinvestigated in other cells, but future studies such as these may prove essential in understanding the role of pi3k in translational regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, et- <dig> substantially affects global transcript expression whereas insulin has a more subtle effect both in terms of relative changes and breadth of the response, and effects of either et- <dig> or insulin on rna recruitment to polysomes are more subtle with differential effects of the two agonists on specific transcripts. notably, insulin stimulates recruitment of established top mrnas to cardiomyocyte polysomes. although we identified some novel top mrnas, we could not identify a top sequence in the 5' utrs of ~43% of the mrnas for established proteins with selective upregulation in the insulin-responsive cardiomyocyte translatome. this suggests that the top mrna response is largely confined to mrnas encoding components of the translational apparatus, and other mechanisms of translational regulation operate in parallel. we suggest that these differences result from activation of different signaling pathways and may account for the overt hypertrophy induced by et- <dig> compared with a "maintenance" effect of insulin. however, with the complexities of the signaling and transcriptional pathways with signal integration at specific nodes, further studies are clearly required to dissect the underlying mechanisms.
