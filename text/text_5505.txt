BACKGROUND
it is estimated that around 90% of human genetic variations are differences in single bases of dna, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . among them, non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms , also known as single amino acid polymorphism , that cause amino acid changes in proteins have the potential to affect both protein structure and protein function  <cit> . some of the mutations in sap sites are not associated with any changes in phenotype and are considered functional neutral, but others bringing deleterious effects to protein function and are responsible for many human genetic diseases  <cit> . recent years have seen an explosion in the number of saps in public databases, such as dbsnp  <cit> , hgvbase  <cit>  and swissprot  <cit> . the large size of these databases presents a challenging hurdle for annotating the effects of all saps by experimental approaches. therefore, computational methods that can quickly distinguish diseasing-causing saps from neutral saps are in urgent need.

many methods have been proposed to classify saps. earlier methods are based on empirical rules  <cit>  or probabilistic models  <cit> . recent methods are based on machine learning techniques, such as decision trees  <cit> , random forests  <cit> , neural networks  <cit> , support vector machines  <cit> s. some of these methods  <cit>  explore only information derived from protein sequence. others use both structural and sequence features of the sap sites. a limitation of using structural features as input is that the methods are not applicable when protein structures are unknown. additionally, all previous methods only consider a small set of features arbitrarily chosen. systematic analysis is still needed to identify features that play vital roles in determining the effects of saps.

in this study, we explored the feasibility of classifying saps using only information derived from protein sequence. we compiled a set of  <dig> features based on previous studies and aaindex  <cit> , a public database of amino acid properties. these features are independent of the structure of sap sites. thus, the developed method can be used to distinguish disease-causing saps from neutral saps even when the structures of sap sites are not known. then, we used a greedy method to discover useful features from the feature set. using the  <dig> selected features, a decision tree method can classify saps with  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  matthews correlation coefficient .

RESULTS
classification performance in cross-validation and independent test
four subsets were used to select features using a greedy approach as described in materials and methods, and  <dig> features were obtained. these features were used to build predictors for classifying saps.

we first evaluated the proposed method using cross-validation. a four-fold cross-validation was performed on the four subsets that were used in feature selection. the results  show that the method achieves  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig>  mcc.

1the proposed method was evaluated on saps from swiss-prot.

we then evaluated the proposed method using an independent test, in which the classifier was trained using the four subsets and then tested on an independent set. note that the independent set was not seen by the algorithm during the feature-selection stage and the training of the classifier. the results  show that the method achieves  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig>  mcc in the independent test. table  <dig> also shows that the proposed method achieves consistent results in cross-validation and independent test.

to evaluate the usefulness of the feature-selection step, we used all the  <dig> features to build a predictor and then evaluated it using cross-validation. the predictor built using  <dig> features only achieved  <dig>  mcc with  <dig> % accuracy. thus, the feature-selection step increased mcc by  <dig>  and accuracy by  <dig> %.

contributions of the selected features
in each step of the feature selection, the feature that brought the largest improvement in performance was chosen. table  <dig> shows the  <dig> selected features in the order that they were chosen. among the  <dig> features, the three features shown in italic fonts  were obtained from the study of ye et al  <cit> , nor_diff_freq is the normalized frequency difference between mutant-type residue and wild-type residue as defined in materials and methods, the other features are defined based on entries from aaindex. figure  <dig> shows how the classification performance was increased when features were chosen. among the  <dig> selected features,  <dig>  are related to residue frequency and substitution,  <dig>  are related to structure and contact energy,  <dig>  indicates whether the sap site is close to functional sites, and  <dig>  shows the family of the protein. the fact that is_hla is selected as a useful feature probably suggests that different rules apply to different families of proteins.

here, nor_diff_freq , is a measure of the frequency difference between the mutant type and wild type. a negative value means that the wild type has higher frequency on the sap position than the mutant type does. the lower is the negative value, the higher is the frequency difference between the wild type and the mutant type. rule  <dig> says "if  then disease". this rule indicates that if the mutation is from a wild type that has high frequency on the mutation site to a mutant type that has low frequency and if the frequency difference is very high, then the mutation will cause diseases. this reflects the hypothesis that if the sap causes dramatic changes in sequence and structural stabilities, then the sap is likely to be deleterious. daym <dig> is the log odds matrix of pam  <dig>  the value between two amino acids shows how often one amino acid replaces the other in evolution. the higher is the value, the more frequently one amino acid replaces the other. to facilitate the explanation, let's borrow the term of similarity. the matrix is viewed as a measure of evolutionary similarity between amino acids. higher values correspond to higher evolutionary similarities between residues. the four rules can be interpreted as below:

• rule  <dig> says " regardless of the similarity between the mutant type and wild type, if the mutant type has lower frequency than the wild type does at the mutation site, and if the difference between their frequencies is very high , then the mutation is disease-related."

• rule  <dig> says "if the similarity between the mutant type and wild type is very low , then although the difference between their frequencies is not very high , the mutation is still disease-related."

• compared with rule  <dig>  rule  <dig> says "if the similarity between the mutant type and wild type is at median levels , then the mutation is disease-related only if the frequency difference between the mutant and wild types is high ."

• compared with rules  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  rule  <dig> shows that if the similarity between the mutant type and wild type is very high , then the difference between their frequencies is no longer a crucial factor in determining the effect of the mutation"

together, these rules reflect the biological knowledge that if a mutation causes little changes  to the protein, then mutation is likely neutral. otherwise, it is likely diseased-related. the frequency difference between the mutant type and the wild type has been shown to be a useful feature for classifying the effect of mutations in many studies. here these rules suggest that, in addition to the frequency difference, one also need to take into account the similarities  between the mutant type and wild type.

comparisons with previously published methods
as discussed by baldi et al.  <cit> , in a two-class classification problem, if the numbers of the two classes are not equal, mcc is a better measure than accuracy for evaluating the classification performance. thus, we use mcc as the main measure in the comparison of different methods.

ye et al  <cit>  developed a support vector machine -based method, sapred, that classifies saps using  <dig> structural and sequence-derived features. in the current study, we used the same dataset ye et al used in their study. on the same dataset, sapred achieved  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc, and our method achieve  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. while the performances of the two methods are comparable, the virtues of our method are two-fold:  our method requires only sequence-derived information as input, and thus are applicable to saps whose structures are not available;  our method is based on a decision tree algorithm that is simpler than the svm used by sapred. during the training of a decision tree-based classifier, there are no parameters needed to be tuned. in contrast, the training of a svm requires enormous efforts to search for optimal parameters  and takes a longer time. compared with svm, the additional benefit of the decision tree is that the decision tree produces rules that can be easily interpreted. in this study, we also tried svm instead of decision tree, but no improvement was observed by switching to svm. note that, in their study, ye et al. also presented a sequence-version of sapred that only required sequence-derived features as input. but the sequence-version of sapred achieved only  <dig>  mcc, which is lower than that of our method.

ye et al  <cit>  also compared sapred with sift  <cit>  using the same dataset used in the current study. based on the results they reported, the method proposed in the current study achieves an increase of  <dig>  in mcc over sift. we also submitted the dataset to panther  <cit> . panther only achieves  <dig>  mcc. comparisons of the roc curves of sift, panther and the current method confirm the improvement the current method over sift and panther . as mentioned above, one merit of our method is that it can be applied to cases where the 3d structures of the proteins are not available. we also evaluated our method using all saps from the swiss-prot variant database. the proposed method achieves  <dig>  mcc with  <dig> % overall accuracy. in comparison, sift achieves only  <dig>  mcc. our method still outperforms sift. the roc curve is showed in figure  <dig> 

bromberg and rost  <cit>  developed a neural network method  for classifying saps. they evaluated the method on a dataset obtained from protein mutant database  <cit>  and 78% accuracy was reported. the dataset from protein mutant database is based on experimental amino acid substitutions, while the dataset used in this study is based on observed human alleles. due to the difference in the datasets used in the two studies, we were unable to make a direct comparison between snap and the method proposed in the current study.

discussion
in contrast to previous studies that only considered a small set of arbitrarily chosen features, we used an automated method to discover features for distinguishing deleterious saps. the search space is more than ten times larger than those considered in previous studies. based on the selected features, we developed a decision-tree based method for classifying saps. the proposed method only requires sequence-derived features as input. thus, it can be applied to all saps. the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of sapred, a state-of-the-art method that uses both structural and sequence-derived features as input, and is much higher than that of sift, a classic method for classifying saps.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the proposed method is a useful tool for the classification of saps, especially, when the structure of the protein is not available.
