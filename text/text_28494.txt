BACKGROUND
experimental genetic manipulations have produced spectacular alterations in the position, size, and shape of primary sensory and motor areas of the mouse neocortex, leading to the conclusion that cortical arealization results in part from intrinsic cortical genetic mechanisms acting early in development  <cit> . for example, hamasaki et al.,  <cit> , manipulated expression of the gene emx <dig> by transgenic methods. with increasing emx <dig> expression, caudal cortical areas increased in size and rostral extent, whereas more rostral areas shifted position and decreased in size. figure  <dig> shows the outlines of primary visual cortex  and the posterior medial barrel subfield  in primary somatosensory cortex  from representative wild-type and ne-emx <dig> mice . as a proportion of the total cortical sheet, the area of v <dig> was 52% increased and the area of pmbsf was 25% decreased in ne-emx <dig> mice compared to wild-type mice  <cit> . motor cortex, the most rostral cortical area measured, showed a 36% decrease in ne-emx <dig> mice. in addition to alteration of cortical area size, cortical area shape changes are evident in figure  <dig>  the shapes of both v <dig> and the pmbsf are increased in rostral extent in ne-emx <dig> mice, although the changes in pmbsf shape are also more complex.

similar differences may be present between standard inbred strains of mice. such differences, although likely more subtle than those induced by hamasaki and colleagues, suggest polymorphism in genes underlying morphogenesis of the cerebral cortex. because of the extensive changes in the cortical area map of transgenic emx <dig> mice, the quantitative descriptions used by hamasaki et al. were adequate in portraying the visible differences in area and shape  <cit> . when differences in the cortical area map are more subtle, then more sensitive, multivariate statistical methods are required. we previously demonstrated significant differences in the size of both v <dig>  and the pmbsf  between the inbred strains c57bl/6j and dba/2j  <cit> . a multivariate logit model predicted strain identity with 90% correct classification rate  <cit> . we were unable, however, to demonstrate any reliable differences in landmark positions in the cortical area map using the methods described by hamasaki et al.,  <cit> . in this paper, we use established statistical methods to analyze shape, called geometric morphometrics .

the analysis of shape has been successfully used to investigate neuroanatomical differences, but mostly within the context of human brain imaging data. for example, using anatomical landmarks from two dimensional magnetic resonance image  scans of the human midsagittal plane, gharaibeh et al.,  <cit> , examined shape changes in the configuration of landmarks following the first episode of schizophrenia. bookstein et al.,  <cit> , used other geometric morphometric methods to describe shape differences in the corpus callosum of fetal alcohol affected human brains, again from mri scans. computational anatomy methods have also been developed to describe shape changes in three dimensional data . the lissencephalic mouse cortex, in stained tangential sections, lends itself well to the application of established geometric morphometric methods for landmarks in two dimensions. there is a long history of using tangential cortical tissue sections in neuroanatomy, but the application of geometric morphometric methods to this histological preparation is novel.

when a tangential section of the adult mouse cortex is stained for the cytochrome oxidase enzyme, the outlines and components of primary visual, somatosensory , and auditory cortex can be reliably discerned . the rodent somatosensory barrel field has been subjected to a number of quantitative analyses under a range of conditions, because barrels provide natural landmarks . each barrel in the pmbsf represents a primary facial vibrissa, and the arrangement of barrels in the cortex preserves the spatial arrangement of whiskers in the periphery. the regular topology of the pmbsf suggests it may serve as a useful indicator of shape changes in the cortical area map. other landmarks may help assess more directly shape change across the entire cortical sheet.

using two sets of landmark configurations, one local  and one more global , we sought to identify differences in shape of primary sensory cortex between c57bl/6j and dba/2j inbred strains. we collected landmark data from cytochrome oxidase stained sections of flattened cortex and compared landmark configurations using the procrustes transformation, a standard method in the analysis of shape . landmarks included the positions of barrels in the pmbsf and minimal landmarks for the triangular shapes of primary visual cortex  and primary somatosensory cortex , and the position of the centroid of primary auditory cortex  . a single landmark for a <dig> is used, because a <dig> is ovoid in shape and lacks reliable outline landmarks, as in v <dig> or s <dig>  similarly, centroids were used as landmarks for each ovoid shaped barrel. the discovery of significant differences between these strains encourages further use of geometric morphometrics to identify genetic or transcript correlates of shape, either by classical trait qtl mapping  or expression qtl mapping  <cit> . geometric morphometrics may also find use in describing the consequences of experimental genetic manipulations affecting the mouse cortical area map. regardless of whether the cortical area map is studied from phenotype to gene or gene to phenotype, the analysis of cortical area map shape will help increase our understanding of cerebral cortical morphogenesis.

RESULTS
local differences: pmbsf
procrustes superimposition
a procrustes superimposition of  <dig> barrel landmarks from each of  <dig> adult c57bl/6j mice and  <dig> adult dba/2j mice is shown in figure  <dig>  this superimposition procedure translates the starting configurations to a common origin, scales them to a common size, and rotates them to minimize an estimate of error . the resulting differences represent changes in shape. approximately 39% of variation in shape of the pmbsf is explained by strain. the probability that this shape conformation between strains could have arisen by chance was tested by permuting the data  <dig>  times, and calculating for each permutation a statistic adapted for shape data, goodall's f statistic. goodall's f test compares the difference in mean shape between two samples relative to the shape variation found within the samples. one in  <dig>  permuted data sets had a goodall's f statistic as great or greater than the f =  <dig>   for the observed data, giving a significance probability of  <dig> .

deformation grids and vector plots
thin-plate spline deformation grids for the procrustes transformed barrel landmarks are shown for c57bl/6j, the consensus  of the two strains, and for dba/2j . immediately noticeable from the general outline of the grids and spacing between barrel landmarks, is an anteroposterior expansion in c57bl/6j  and the corresponding anteroposterior compression in dba/2j . differences in anteroposterior spacing between barrel landmarks is particularly apparent in barrel rows a and b. less obvious, but still noticeable from the general grid outline, are mediolateral effects. the overall shape of the c57bl/6j grid in 4a is wider posteriorly, with the opposite effect apparent in dba/2j – in other words, there is posterior lateral expansion and anterior lateral compression in the pmbsf of c57bl/6j. in addition to general anteroposterior and mediolateral differences in pmbsf shape, there are also focal anteroposterior and mediolateral effects. along the a-p axis, there is straightening of the anterior ends of rows c, d, and e in dba/2j . along the m-l axis, rows a, b, and c are relatively compressed in c57bl/6j, while rows c, d, and e are relatively compressed in dba/2j. each of these general and focal effects described in the deformation grids can actually be discerned in the scatterplot, though it requires looking back and forth between the plots. conversely, the comments made above for the scatterplot also are evident in the deformation grids. an alternative representation of the noted shape changes above is shown in 4b. these plots represent the change in barrel position by vectors.

uniform components of shape
the plots in figure 4a and 4b represent shape changes from the total variation shown in figure  <dig>  shape variation can be decomposed into uniform and non-uniform components  <cit> , and both the deformation grids and the vector plots in 4a or 4b illustrate the combined effects of uniform and non-uniform components of shape. uniform components of shape do not bend the parallel grid lines in deformation plots such as those shown in figure 4a. two kinds of uniform shape differences are compression and shearing. compression and shearing, for example, would make a rectangle more narrow or would make a rectangle into a parallelogram, respectively .

global differences: v <dig>  s <dig>  a1
procrustes superimposition
a procrustes superimposition of  <dig> landmarks across v <dig>  s <dig>  and a <dig> from each of  <dig> adult c57bl/6j mice and  <dig> adult dba/2j mice is shown in figure  <dig>  approximately  <dig> % of variation in the shape of the cortical area map is explained by strain. using a permutation test to confirm strain differences in shape variation,  <dig> in  <dig>  permuted data sets had a goodall's f statistic as great or greater than the f =  <dig>   for the observed data, giving a significance probability of  <dig> .

separation by strain is evident in the lateral and rostral v <dig> landmarks, and the most lateral s <dig> landmark. other landmarks show no clear separation between strains.

deformation grids and vector plots
thin-plate spline deformation grids for the procrustes transformed primary sensory cortex landmarks are shown in figure 6a for c57bl/6j, the consensus or average, and dba/2j. figure 6b shows the corresponding vector plots. the positions of the lateral s <dig> landmark and the a <dig> landmark are in closer proximity in dba/2j relative to c57bl/6j. this may reflect local changes in the pmbsf already described. also in figure 6a–b, v <dig> is anteriorly and laterally expanded in c57bl/6j relative to dba/2j.

uniform components of shape
despite the presence of significant uniform shape components in the local pmbsf, and the presence of significant shape differences across v <dig>  s <dig>  and a <dig>  there were no significant uniform shape components in this second landmark configuration.

v <dig> subset
the  <dig> landmarks for the triangular shape of v <dig> were analyzed separately. approximately  <dig> % of variation in shape of v <dig> is explained by strain. using a permutation test to confirm strain differences in shape variation,  <dig> in  <dig>  permuted data sets had a goodall's f statistic as great or greater than the f =  <dig>   for the observed data, giving a significance probability of  <dig> . v <dig> appears elongated both in the anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions in c57bl/6j relative to dba/2j.

discussion
using a novel application of established methods of geometric morphometrics for the analysis of shape, we have demonstrated differences in the primary sensory areas of cortex between the inbred, isogenic mouse strains c57bl/6j and dba/2j. we found significant differences in the shape of the posterior medial barrel subfield using the positions of the barrels as landmarks, and we found additional differences between minimal landmarks of v <dig>  s <dig>  and a <dig>  combined with a prior study of planar areal differences in c57bl/6j and dba/2j  <cit> , the cortical area maps of these common, inbred mouse strains have now been shown to differ significantly in measures of both primary sensory cortex area and shape. rostrolateral differences between c57bl/6j and dba/2j in the pmbsf and in v <dig> are reminiscent of effects seen in mice over expressing the transcription factor emx <dig> . closer inspection of the procrustes superimposition of barrels between inbred strains and the superimposition between transgenic ne-emx <dig> mice reveals interesting parallels but differences as well . while we do not claim the phenotypic differences between c57bl/6j and dba/2j shown here are evidence of differences in emx <dig> expression across these strains, the described shape differences could nonetheless result from polymorphism in early cortical patterning genes or differences in gradients or local enrichments of transcription factors, including emx <dig> 

cortical arealization initiates from early secreted ligands and graded distribution of transcription factors, which trigger the activation of distinctive area-specific morphogenetic programs, and result in an ordered topology of species-typical primary sensory and motor cortical areas . manipulation of transcription factor gradients have altered caudal and rostral cortical allotment to specific cortical fields. for example, hamasaki et al.,  <cit>  caused a caudal over expression of emx <dig>  homzygote ne-emx <dig> mice, compared to wild-type mice, showed a gradient of change in cortical area size from the caudal to the rostral poles. transgenic ne-emx <dig> mice showed a 52% increase in v <dig>  a 25% decrease in pmbsf, and a 36% decrease in motor cortex. there was also a rostrolateral shift in the positions of s <dig> and a <dig>  hamasaki et al.,  <cit>  have been the only group to quantitate in some detail the anatomical effects of their genetic manipulations, although their methods are unrelated to the geometric morphometric descriptions of shape in two dimensions used in the present paper.

the application of shape statistics to sections of the flattened cortical sheet is an obvious but powerful innovation that has the potential to improve and unify attempts to detect and describe effects of genetic manipulations on cortical arealization. in addition to improving phenotypic description of genetic manipulations putatively affecting cortex arealization, shape analysis of the cortical area map enables forward genetic efforts to isolate quantitative trait loci . this approach would correlate measured quantitative phenotypic variation in cortex to genetic variation between mice or lines of mice . shape statistics has been applied successfully to isolate a large number of qtls for mouse mandible shape  <cit> . cortical morphogenesis has been predominantly studied using experimental  genetic strategies. relatively few genes have been identified that play a role in specifying the cortical area map, and our understanding of the genetic network active during cortical specification is poor. genes that have been identified, however, are well supported  <cit> . forward genetic approaches to cortical morphogenesis would provide a complementary strategy. although the conversion of qtls to identified genes is difficult, advances in forward genetic methods have demonstrated success  <cit> .

another approach is to use gene microarray technologies to identify spatial or temporal differences in gene expression in the developing cortex. use of microarrays in genetically manipulated mice  <cit> , or mice of differing genetic backgrounds  <cit> , is a promising discovery approach to understanding the network of transcription factors that must coordinately define the cortical area map. sansom et al.,  <cit> , used microarrays to characterize the early cortical transcriptome of mice lacking a receptor important in fgf signaling, and identified and validated the novel target gene mest. given differences in v <dig> area and shape between c57bl/6j and dba/2j strains, microarrays could be used to test for differences between strains in the transcriptome from caudal, embryonic cortex. although the work of sansom et al.,  <cit> , is a model study, it lacked direct correlation of the transcriptome differences to cortical map phenotypes.

an approach that integrates genetic, transcript, and phenotypic variation would use the genetic reference population of bxd recombinant inbred lines  <cit> . this panel of genetically varied lines derived from c57bl/6j and dba/2j strains can be phenotyped for cortical area and shape differences  and also characterized for anterior-posterior early cortical gene expression differences between lines . since both parental inbred strains are fully sequenced, the full complement of genetic variation is archival in the bxd and need not be re-genotyped . phenotype to genotype , phenotype to transcript, and transcript to genotype  relationships could then all be evaluated, genome-wide  <cit> . because we have now shown that the parental strains c57bl/6j and dba/2j markedly differ in both quantitative measures of cortex area size  <cit>  and shape, this assures variation in the derivative bxd lines, and provides an empirical basis for using the bxd panel to study cortical development.

CONCLUSIONS
c57bl/6j and dba/2j have markedly different cortical area maps, in both size and shape. these differences suggest polymorphism in genetic factors underlying cortical specification, even between common isogenic strains. comparing cortical phenotypes between normally varying inbred mice or between genetically modified mice can identify genetic contributions to cortical specification. geometric morphometrics represents an additional quantitative tool for the study of cortical development, regardless of whether it is studied from phenotype to gene or gene to phenotype.
