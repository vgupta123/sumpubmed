BACKGROUND
chromatin structure plays a critical role in all processes involving the genome of eukaryotic organisms. the first step in chromatin establishment de novo is the deposition of an  <dig> heterotetramer onto dna by one or more of several histone chaperones including asf <dig>  caf- <dig>  and the hir complex. the pre-nucleosomal  <dig> intermediate then binds to two histone h2a/h2b heterodimers, which complete the core histone octamer and allow for proper wrapping of nucleosomal dna .

histone h3/h <dig> chaperones participate in two similar, yet functionally distinct pathways. the first involves replication-coupled  histone deposition during s-phase, in which caf-1-histone complexes are recruited to sites of dna replication through an interaction with the dna polymerase processivity factor pcna  <cit> . the second pathway is a replication-independent  histone deposition process that occurs during all stages in the cell cycle and involves the hir complex  <cit> . ri histone deposition has been linked to chromatin reorginization during both transcription  <cit>  and embryogenesis  <cit> .

most multicellular eukaryotes, unlike fission and budding yeasts, contain two major types of histone h <dig> isoforms: the very closely related h <dig> /h <dig>  proteins, and the more distinct h <dig>  variant  <cit> . although these histones differ by only a few amino acids, expression and deposition of h <dig> /h <dig>  is limited to s phase, while h <dig>  is expressed and deposited at all times during the cell cycle  <cit> . consistent with caf-1's role in rc deposition, caf- <dig> has been purified from human cell extracts in complex with histone h <dig>  but not h <dig>   <cit> . conversely, hira, the human homologue of yeast hir <dig> and hir <dig>  can be found complexed with h <dig>  but not h <dig>   <cit> .

asf <dig> is the common entity shared by the rc and ri pathways, because it binds to and stimulates histone deposition by both the caf- <dig> and hir complexes  <cit> . asf <dig> proteins from all eukaryotes share a very conserved  <dig> residue n-terminal immunoglobulin-like fold domain  <cit> . in contrast, the c-termini of asf <dig> proteins from different organisms are highly divergent. interestingly, dmasf <dig>  hsasf1a, and hsasf1b share nearly 60% sequence identity within the conserved n-terminal domain, yet all fail to fully restore dna damage resistance or chromatin-mediated gene silencing in yeast when placed under the control of the endogenous promoter  <cit> . these data suggest that species-specific interactions within this domain are functionally crucial. notably, the yeast asf <dig> n-terminal domain is fully functional as a truncation both in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> .

to date, structural information on how histone chaperones associate with histones and/or each other has been sparse. to gain insight into histone deposition, we have employed structural, biochemical, and genetic techniques to study the interaction between asf <dig> and histones h3/h <dig>  we determined the structure of the conserved n-terminus of budding yeast asf <dig> bound to the c-terminal α <dig> helix of yeast histone h <dig> to  <dig>  Å resolution. this peptide was chosen because it was shown to interact with asf <dig> through nmr experiments  <cit>  as well as two-hybrid analysis  <cit> . in addition, this helix is the known site of h3-h <dig> interactions in the core tetramer of the nucleosomal octamer, and most likely is involved in the regulation of histone stoichiometry. the structure identifies several residues that are critical for the interaction, and we demonstrate that mutation of these residues affects histone h3/h <dig> binding in vitro and causes characteristic silencing phenotypes in vivo. remarkably, modeling of this structure into the histone core octamer of the nucleosome indicates that binding of the conserved n-terminus of asf <dig> to h <dig> directly occludes h3/h <dig> homodimer interactions. this work therefore provides detailed information about the interaction between a histone chaperone protein and client histone target. these data also provide insights into how asf <dig> affects both the inheritance of chromatin structures and the deposition of different histone h <dig> isoforms.

RESULTS
structure of asf1n bound to h3α3
the conserved n-terminus of yeast asf <dig>  is sufficient for wild type function in vivo, and binds histones h3/h <dig>  rfc, and rad <dig> in vitro  <cit> . because the interaction between the c-terminal histone h <dig> α <dig> helix  and asf <dig> is of modest affinity   <cit> , we stabilized the association by fusing asf1n to h3α <dig> with a flexible linker peptide. the fusion protein was overexpressed in e. coli, purified to homogeneity, and used for crystallization studies .

we determined the structure of asf1n bound to h3α <dig> to  <dig>  Å resolution, using a previously solved structure of yeast asf1n for molecular replacement  <cit> . after several rounds of refinement using a histone-free model of asf <dig>  density corresponding to the histone helix became clearly visible, permitting manual building of the h <dig> helix. simulated annealing omit maps  <cit>  further confirmed the electron density and model built for this region . as seen previously, asf <dig> alone adopts a switched-type immunoglobulin-like  fold containing two extra, short β-strands .

the global fold of asf1n in the current structure is nearly identical to that solved previously without the histone helix . the only significant changes in the structure are a forward rotation of the loop connecting β-strands c and c', as well as a small rotation of the loop and α-helix connecting β-strands e and f. interestingly, the positions of both of these regions resemble those found in the nmr structure of the human homologue hsasf1an   <cit> . these observations suggest that specific regions of asf1n may adopt multiple local conformations depending upon its binding partner.

the histone binding pocket on asf1
nmr experiments have shown that a short c-terminal h <dig> peptide  adopts its proper helical structure in the presence but not absence of hsasf1an  <cit> . the same study further identified a probable histone-binding patch on the front β-sheet of asf1n using genetic and biochemical analyses of mutant proteins. these studies did not identify, however, the geometry of the interaction nor the complete retinue of specific histone-asf <dig> interactions.

the structure solved here shows that the histone helix binds to asf <dig> in this predicted region, but in an unanticipated orientation. mutational analysis of this region  <cit>  had led to the prediction that the helix axis would run perpendicular to β-strand direction of asf <dig>  as opposed to the parallel configuration we now confirm in our structure. the h <dig> α-helix lies in a pocket defined by hydrophobic residues on one side and an intricate hydrogen-bonding network on the other . notably, to properly form the pocket, the β-c/β-c' connecting loop folds downward , bringing residues ser <dig> and ser <dig> in proximity to contribute to the hydrogen-bonding network .

the residues comprising the hydrophobic portion of the interface between both asf <dig> and h <dig> are essentially identical throughout all eukaryotic species sequenced to date  <cit> . the one exception to this rule is leu <dig> of h <dig> in s. cerevisiae, which is changed to the similar amino acid isoleucine in all other eukaryotes. leu <dig> makes van der waals contacts to asf <dig> amino acids val <dig>  tyr <dig>  arg <dig>  and leu <dig> . leu <dig> of histone h <dig> also makes hydrophobic interactions with val <dig> and val <dig>  both of which are well-conserved residues on asf <dig> 

a lone salt bridge is formed between the invariant residues asp <dig> on asf <dig> and arg <dig> on h <dig>  the carboxylate and guanidinium groups on these side chains sit approximately 3Å apart and further coordinate a pair of water molecules . interestingly, these waters participate in an extensive hydrogen-bond network  that includes a polar interaction between the invariant lys <dig> on h <dig> and the yeast-specific asf <dig> residue ser <dig>  as well as the main chain carbonyl of its neighboring amino acid, val <dig>  the two water networks that coordinate the interactions described above are bridged by a second yeast-specific residue, ser <dig>  which hydrogen-bonds to waters in both networks. the yeast-specific residues central to the hydrogen-bonded network suggest that this interaction may comprise a species-specificity determinant . lastly, asf <dig> residue thr <dig> and the main chain carbonyl from h3-l <dig> interact indirectly by hydrogen bonding to a bridging water molecule. importantly, no density was seen for the eight amino acid linker peptide past the first two alanine residues, indicating that the fusion has not constrained the orientation of the h3/asf1n interaction in an artificial manner.

genetic analysis of histone binding mutants
to assess the in vivo relevance of the contacting residues identified by our structure, we examined heterochromatic gene silencing in asf <dig> mutant cells, because asf <dig> is crucial for silencing in yeast cells lacking cac genes encoding caf- <dig> subunits  <cit> . we therefore expressed wild-type and mutant asf <dig> genes in a cac1Δasf1Δ strain and measured silencing of a ura <dig> reporter gene at the left telomere of chromosome vii.

in line with previous reports  <cit> , cac <dig> asf <dig> cells transformed with a wt asf1-expressing plasmid were able to grow on plates containing 5-foa , indicating that telomeric silencing is stimulated by functional asf <dig> protein. as a negative control, cells carrying an empty vector could not grow on 5-foa plates, indicating defective silencing. as another control, the mutations h36a/d37a, residues important for asf1's interaction with hira and cac <dig>  <cit> , as well as the proximal mutations h39a/k41a, caused the expected defective silencing phenotypes. in contrast, cells transformed with plasmids containing mutations in residues proximal to, but outside of the histone binding patch, such as n114a/e116a and e142a/k143a double mutants, displayed robust growth on 5-foa containing plates. therefore, our assay can distinguish point mutations that specifically affect the silencing function of asf <dig> 

notably, cells transformed with plasmids harboring mutations in residues participating in the asf1-h <dig> interaction identified by our structure were unable to grow on 5-foa-containing media. specifically, v94d/l96d double mutants displayed poor silencing, as did r145a/t147a and h53a/d54a double mutants. tyr <dig> mutations caused similar defective silencing phenotypes. one other residue that is proximal to the interface is val45; v45d mutants likewise displayed defective silencing, suggesting that the conserved hydrophobic patch that mediates the asf1/h <dig> interaction is intolerant for acidic side chains. we thus conclude that defects in heterochromatic gene silencing can arise from perturbation of the h3-asf <dig> interface contacts identified by our structure.

biochemical characterization of asf1n-h <dig> interactions
to further validate our structure, we tested mutant asf <dig> proteins for binding histones h3/h <dig> using a co-precipitation assay of proteins co-expressed in bacteria. as expected, wt asf <dig> was able to co-precipitate h <dig>  while pull-downs from extracts containing no asf <dig> yielded no h <dig> . we further observed that asf <dig> mutants containing single point changes in residues implicated by our structure , as well as the double mutants r145a/t147a and v94d/l96d, failed to co-precipitate h <dig> . importantly, mutant asf <dig> proteins with alterations in residues not involved in the asf1/h <dig> interaction, including the n114a/e116a, e39/k41a, and h36a/d37a double mutants, were still able to co-precipitate h <dig> .

these results highlight the importance of both the van der waals and ionic interactions identified here structurally to binding affinity and asf <dig> function. importantly, the l96a and h53a mutations in asf <dig>  which only weakly perturb histone association , are seen to be only peripherally involved in h <dig> contacts. together, these data indicate that the asf1-histone interface revealed by the structural data is physiologically relevant, although we note that our model does not preclude the possibility of additional contacts beyond those observed here arising between asf <dig> and other regions of histones h <dig> and/or h <dig> 

asf <dig> is poised to sterically block h3/h <dig> heterotetramerization
several lines of evidence suggest that histone h3/h <dig> chaperones, including asf <dig>  interact with dimeric and not tetrameric h3/h <dig> species  <cit> . however, histones h3/h <dig> spontaneously form tetramers under physiological conditions  <cit> . these data indicate that histone chaperones can somehow regulate the propensity of the h3/h <dig> heterodimer to tetramerize. to better understand this process, we superposed the asf1-h3α <dig> interaction onto the known  <dig> structure of the yeast nucleosome   <cit>  using h3α <dig> α-carbons from our structure as a guide. remarkably, inspection of the two structures reveals that asf <dig> binds to histone h <dig> in an orientation that directly occludes formation of the four-helix bundle formed at the h3/h <dig> dimer interface . we discuss the implications of this model below.

discussion
species-specific differences in the asf1-h <dig> interaction
although asf <dig> and histone h <dig> are all very highly conserved across eukaryota, we find that there are several species-specific residues participating in their interaction. this observation suggests that s. cerevisae asf <dig> may coordinate its histones somewhat differently than metazoan orthologs of asf <dig>  such behavior would help explain why dmasf <dig>  hsasf1a, and hsasf1b all fail to fully restore heterochromatic gene silencing and genome stability to yeast lacking asf <dig>  <cit> .

the most obvious difference between yeast and metazoan asf <dig> within the histone binding-patch is the s. cerevisiae-specific residue, ser <dig>  this amino acid defines one end of a large hydrogen-bonding network that runs along the outer-edge of the hydrophobic h <dig> binding pocket down to the salt bridge formed by asf1-asp <dig> and h3-arg <dig>  the centerpiece for this network is a second s. cerevisiae-specific residue, ser <dig>  oddly, sequence comparisons suggest that this hydrogen-bond network may be less extensive in most eukaryotes: ser <dig> is either glycine or alanine, while ser <dig> is always a glycine, from fission yeast to man .

as evidenced by a lack of observable electron density for the side chain atoms of lys <dig> of h <dig> and asf1-arg <dig>  our structure suggests that these s. cerevisiae-specific residues do not participate in the histone/chaperone complex . lys <dig> of h <dig> is an invariant glutamine in all other species sequenced to date, whereas arg <dig> of asf <dig> is conserved as either threonine or glutamic acid. interestingly, nmr studies have identified both ala <dig> and glu <dig> of hsasf1a as having two of the largest chemical shift variations upon binding to the c-terminal helix of h <dig>  <cit> , implicating these residues in the human interaction. it is possible that the conformation of this region may be subtly different in the bound forms of metazoan asf <dig>  with the corresponding amino acids making different interactions to h <dig> as seen for serines  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, gly <dig> of human asf <dig> was also implicated in h <dig> binding, suggesting that the metazoan asf1/h <dig> interaction may have a more hydrophobic character than seen for yeast.

taken together, these data suggest that both yeast and metazoan asf <dig> proteins utilize an element of species-specific interactions to coordinate histone h <dig>  although the overall conservation of the interface strongly indicates that the global position and orientation of the h3α <dig> helix are likely to be very similar. this finding raises a cautionary note about the use of proteins from heterologous species in biochemical assays, because small differences in their specific interactions could cause misregulation of asf1-mediated histone deposition during processes such as dna replication and transcription.

structural implications for epigenetic inheritance
a major question in biology is how cells transmit epigenetic information in the form of histone modifications during passage of the dna replication fork. recent data have suggested that histone chaperones, including asf <dig>  bind to h3/h <dig> dimers and not tetramers. the existence of h3/h <dig> dimers as assembly intermediates raises the possibility that parental dimers can be mixed with nascent ones during replication, forming nucleosomes containing mixed tetramers. this would add an additional layer of complexity to the patterns of inheritance of epigenetic marks on histones during genome duplication  <cit> .

our structure suggests a physical model for the control of histone stoichiometry by asf <dig>  by binding to and occluding proper formation of the four-helix bundle, asf <dig> is positioned to directly disrupt histone tetramerization . in this manner, asf <dig> may be able to modulate epigenetic information by participating in histone eviction ahead of the replication fork, as is observed during transcription  <cit> , thus promoting mixing of existing and newly-synthesized h3/h <dig> dimers. deposition of mixed tetramers would ensure that some daughter nucleosomes contain both parental and nascent histone modifications.

this is a potentially advantageous process, because newly synthesized histone h <dig> molecules are acetylated on lysine  <dig>  a modification associated with genome stability and resistance to dna damaging agents  <cit> , while parental histones contain epigenetic information critical for the maintenance of a proper transcriptional profile. a future challenge for the field will be to define the mechanisms that form and interpret combinations of modifications on single nucleosomes resulting from h3/h <dig> dimer mixing.

asf <dig> binds to histone h3/h <dig> in order to present them to various complexes
it is becoming clear that a major facet of asf1's activity is to present histones to other proteins in a specific manner. for example, asf <dig> is required for acetylation of newly-synthesized h <dig> on k <dig> prior to deposition by an unidentified enzyme  <cit> . consistent with this finding, our model predicts that h3-k <dig> is solvent exposed when bound to asf <dig> .

additionally, hake and allis have proposed an "h <dig> barcode hypothesis"  <cit> , in which distinct histone isoforms are differentially deposited onto chromatin by interpretation of the their "barcode" through chaperones such as caf- <dig> and hir proteins. our structural model suggests that asf <dig> presents h3/h <dig> dimers to isoform-specific chaperones in an orientation that could facilitate decoding, allowing the chaperone cooperating with asf <dig> to accept or reject a given histone h <dig> variant. consistent with this idea, residues 87– <dig> of histone h <dig>  which confer isoform specificity  <cit> , remain exposed following asf <dig> binding . moreover, our model indicates that the hira binding site on asf <dig>  <cit>  also remains exposed upon histone binding. we propose that asf <dig> presents h <dig> isoforms to other proteins including caf- <dig> and hira by forming a ternary structure in which asf <dig> acts as a bridge to stabilize contacts between h <dig> and the assisting chaperone. furthermore, our model predicts that asf <dig> would contribute to the histone barcode by generating the proper geometry between histones h3/h <dig> and the assisting chaperone in the ternary complex.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have determined the crystal structure of the histone chaperone asf <dig> bound to the c-terminal helix of h <dig>  support for the physiological validity of this structure is provided by genetic as well as biochemical mutational analyses. significantly, modeling of our structure into the yeast nucleosome explains why asf <dig> dissociates histone h3/h <dig> tetramers into dimers and suggests that epigenetic inheritance can be directly modulated by asf <dig>  future studies will be required to understand the molecular details of histone deposition, the functional synergy between different histone chaperones, and to determine the histone-binding modes of other chaperones.
