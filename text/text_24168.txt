BACKGROUND
most crop plants are exposed to heat stress during certain stages of their life cycle. heat stress, defined as the temperature above a normal optimum, is expected to become a major issue in reducing crop production in coming years due to global warming
 <cit> . grape is a popular cultivated fruit throughout the world and represents one of the most important crops with highly valued products such as juices, liquors and wines
 <cit> . the grape species vitis vinifera makes up most of the grape production in the world. however, grape production and quality often fluctuate due to various environmental factors. temperature has been broadly considered as a major determining factor. studies show that crop production is severely limited by temperature stresses around the world
 <cit> . in many regions, the maximum midday air temperature can reach 40°c and above, which can destroy grape berry ripening
 <cit> . in addition, crop cultivation in sheltered conditions  is common in many regions. these conditions can further increase temperature due to inadequate air circulation. studies indicated that temperatures above 35°c generally reduce photosynthesis in grape leaves
 <cit> . extreme temperatures may endanger berry quality and economic returns
 <cit> . this is expected to get worse with more frequent high temperature stress due to climate change
 <cit> .

in the past, studies of response and adaptation of grape to high temperatures have focused mostly on grape morphological and physiological changes including photosynthesis, respiration, cell membrane stability, hormone changes and antioxidant systems
 <cit> . with the availability of the grape genome sequence
 <cit> , study of the functional genomics of grapes has become possible
 <cit> . transcriptomic analysis represents one of these major research opportunities. gene expression is tissue- and development-specific. to date, transcriptomic studies in grapes has been primarily focused on berry development and water stress responses
 <cit> . there are few transcriptomic reports of the effect of heat stress on grape.

transcriptomic studies of heat stress effects on arabidopsis, rice, tobacco, potato, tomato and sunflower have been reported
 <cit> . lim et al.
 <cit>  found that acclimating arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells at a moderate heat enhanced heat resistance. expression of  <dig> genes changed, especially those of heat shock proteins . with cdna microarrays and rt-qpcr techniques, frank et al.
 <cit>  found that hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and heat shock transcription factors hsfa <dig> and hsfa <dig> were important to tomato microspore resistance to heat stress. however, data on the molecular mechanisms involved in heat stress responses and thermotolerance in grape leaves are very limited.

some studies have shown that the recovery process from heat stress in plants is very important to survival
 <cit> . the degree of recovery from stress is a direct index of plant heat tolerance. thus, there should be some differences between the recovery mechanisms and the direct heat response mechanisms in plants
 <cit> . gu et al.
 <cit>  found that sucrose synthase, calmodulin, certain peptides, and aquaporin genes in populus were transcriptionally-activated only during recovery from salt stress.

in this study, we used oligonucleotide microarrays and quantitative real-time pcr  to identify genes in grape leaves with altered transcript accumulation during heat stress and after recovery to provide clues to the function of these genes during heat stress and subsequent recovery.

RESULTS
expression and validation of probes sets responsive to heat stress or recovery in grape leaves
transcriptomic profiles of gene expression variation in vitis vinifera cv. cabernet sauvignon leaves in response to heat treatment and subsequent recovery was quantitatively assessed using the affymetrix grape genome array with  <dig>  probe sets. array data were averaged for three biological replicates and filtered as described in materials and methods. using the filtering criteria,  <dig>  were significantly affected by heat or recovery and were further analyzed. heat stress and recovery affected transcript levels in different ways. among those probe sets showing differential expression during heat stress ,  <dig> were upregulated,  <dig> were downregulated, while  <dig> were induced and  <dig> were repressed after recovery compared to their corresponding control levels . a total of  <dig> probe sets were commonly upregulated by heat stress and recovery, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> were specifically induced by both treatments, respectively. a total of  <dig> probe sets were commonly downregulated by both treatments, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> were specifically repressed by heat stress and recovery, respectively. moreover,  <dig> probe sets were repressed by heat stress but induced by recovery, and  <dig> probe sets were upregulated by heat stress and downregulated by recovery. cluster analysis also indicated that some genes were up- or downregulated under heat stress and after recovery . in order to validate the results obtained with the microarray analyses, we carried out qrt-pcr assays on  <dig> cdna sequences using gene-specific primers . the qrt-pcr profiles were analyzed on three biological replicates. linear regression analyses displayed highly significant correlations  between qrt-pcr and microarray results for the  <dig> evaluated genes , confirming the validity of the microarray results.

functional analysis of probes sets responsive to heat stress or recovery in grape leaves
there were a large number of genes which were responsive to heat stress or recovery that do not match any genes with known functions. eight hundred and twenty-one probe sets were assigned to annotated genes and ests in plexdb . functional categories of these probe sets based on mips  are shown in figure
 <dig>  furthermore, we compared the common probe sets between heat stress and recovery, and analyzed probe sets unique to both treatments, based on functional classification. the changes of some genes such as hsps were similar to those in previous studies on microarray analysis of heat stress in rice, arabidopsis, tomato, barley and potato

discussion
high temperature disturbs cellular homeostasis in plants and can lead to severe retardation of growth and development and even death. plants exposed to heat stress exhibit a characteristic set of cellular and metabolic responses. based on the results detailed above, the discussion focuses on the response of grape leaves to heat stress and subsequent recovery from the following aspects.

hsps and antioxidant enzymes
one typical response to heat stress is an accelerated transcription of a set of stress or protein fate-related genes, such as those encoding hsps, which are the main constituents of the heat shock response
 <cit> . the major hsps belong to five structurally distinct classes: hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and small hsps 
 <cit> . in this study, heat stress increased the expression of various hsps. the transcript level of these hsps decreased to the control level or even lower after the subsequent recovery . under heat stress, many proteins in the cell are subject to denaturation, and hsps function as molecular chaperones to provide protection. after the recovery, these hsps are degraded. moreover, a large amount of hsps in cells resulted in the decline of transcript level of hsps genes
 <cit> . wang et al.
 <cit>  reported that the expression of protein hsp <dig> was induced by heat stress in grapevine leaves, and was lower than that of the control after the recovery. in plants, shsps form a more diverse subfamily than other hsps/chaperones with respect to sequence similarity, cellular location and function. the shsps are not themselves able to refold non-native proteins, but have a high capacity to bind non-native proteins, possibly through hydrophobic interactions, and to stabilize and prevent non-native aggregation, thereby facilitating their subsequent refolding by atp-dependent chaperones such as the dnak system or clpb/dnak. increasing evidence suggests strong correlation between shsp accumulation and plant tolerance to stress
 <cit> . chloroplast and mitochondrial shsps are considered to play an important role in heat tolerance
 <cit> . in this study, hsp <dig> located in mitochondria was highly expressed under heat stress and was downregulated after recovery. hsp <dig> located in the chloroplast was highly expressed  by heat stress, but its transcription level declined to the control level after the following recovery . this result shows that some shsps may have important effects on heat tolerance of grapevines.

among the other hsps, over expression of hsp <dig> in arabidopsis had a positive effect on growth after recovery
 <cit> . it was recently found that an hsp <dig> homologue in arabidopsis was involved in conferring thermotolerance to chloroplasts during heat stress
 <cit> . genetic analysis in arabidopsis indicated that hsp <dig> interacts with the shsp chaperone system to re-solubilize protein aggregates after heat stress
 <cit> . recently, it was demonstrated that the transcript level of hsp <dig> increased in maturing tomato pollen grains in response to heat stress
 <cit> . in the present study, hsp <dig> in grape leaves was upregulated by heat stress, exhibiting a 9-fold elevated expression, but it was downregulated 6-fold after the subsequent recovery. hsp <dig> has essential functions in preventing aggregation and in assisting refolding of non-native proteins under both normal and stress conditions
 <cit> . some family members of hsp <dig> are consistently expressed and are often referred to as hsc <dig>  these members are often involved in assisting the folding of de novo synthesized polypeptides and the import/translocation of precursor proteins. in this study, the expression of hsc <dig> was induced by heat stress and declined after the subsequent recovery, in agreement with previous results.

in heat stress studies, increasing attention has being paid to the generation of reactive oxygen species  and the cellular antioxidant defense systems. ros levels are controlled by a network of enzymes and metabolites, including superoxide dismutases , ascorbate peroxidase , guaiacol peroxidase  and dehydroascorbate reductase . apx plays a pivotal role in ros metabolism. it catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water by using ascorbate as a specific electron donor
 <cit> . apx appears to be regulated by hsfa2
 <cit> . previous studies also indicated that it is involved in survival from high light stress
 <cit> . the results of the present study showed that expression of apx, peroxidase  <dig> and dhar were upregulated by 5-,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, indicating that these genes may have an important role in grape leaves in response to heat stress.

metabolism
temperature is one of the most active environmental factors affecting all plant metabolic activities, including amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism
 <cit> . secondary metabolites are involved in resistance against heat shock
 <cit> . in this study, galactinol synthase transcript level increased significantly  in response to heat stress and declined during recovery. heat shock induced the production of sugars including raffinose and galactinol
 <cit> . the raffinose family of oligosaccharides has been implicated in the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals
 <cit> , and in protecting liposomes from desiccation through direct sugar–membrane interactions in soybean
 <cit> . galactinol synthase catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of raffinose polysaccharide, and is also regulated by hsfa <dig> in arabidopsis, linking heat shock proteins and raffinose metabolism
 <cit> . weston et al.
 <cit>  reported that expression of atgols <dig> was observed even at optimal temperature, and was upregulated during heat stress. several other probe sets representing genes related to carbohydrate metabolism were regulated by heat stress in our experiment, such as invertase, udp-glucose dehydrogenase, 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, sucrose synthase, amylase and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase . these enzymes are important in sugar metabolism, which were downregulated by heat stress in this study. in addition, lipid metabolism was also inhibited by heat stress, with effects on lipase, l-asparaginase, lipoxygenase and fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase.

transcription factors 
hsfs play important roles in both basal and acquired thermotolerance through binding to cis-acting regulatory elements called heat shock element  in the promoter region of hsp genes
 <cit> . in general, plant hsfs are divided into three classes, hsfas, hsfbs and hsfcs
 <cit> . hsf <dig> belongs to hsfa <dig> which was the dominant hsf in thermotolerant cells
 <cit>  and was highly heat shock upregulated in mature tomato microspores
 <cit> . the transcript levels of the hsfa <dig> target genes  were highly correlated with those of hsfa <dig> in pro35s:hsfa <dig> arabidopsis plants, and the induction of hsfa <dig> target genes was strongly reduced under heat stress in hsfa <dig> knockout arabidopsis plants
 <cit> . in this study, hsf <dig> exhibited increased expression levels  under heat stress and was downregulated  after the subsequent recovery corresponding to  <dig> hsps . the present results indicated that hsf <dig> may also play an important regulatory role in the thermotolerance of grape. hsf <dig> is an hsfb2b and was strongly induced by heat stress in arabidopsis, maize and tomato
 <cit> . however, hsf <dig> was weakly upregulated  by heat stress, but showed significant down-regulation  after recovery in the present study. this indicated that hsf <dig> may play an important role in reducing expression of hsps after recovery in grape leaves. in addition, hsf <dig> governs the expression of hsps and regulates thermotolerance
 <cit> . hsf <dig> belongs to the hsfa1a group, which was identified as a master regulator of thermotolerance in tomato
 <cit> . the synthesis of members of hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and shsps under heat stress in the hsf1-rnai strains of chlamydomonas was dramatically reduced or completely abolished
 <cit> . in the present study, hsf <dig> showed similar sign of change as hsf <dig>  therefore, hsf <dig> and hsf <dig> may play important roles in the recovery process from heat stress in grape leaves.

qin et al.
 <cit>  reported that ethylene-responsive transcriptional co-activator  gene is upregulated more than 8-fold in all heat treated wheat leaves. over-expression of ertca enhanced heat stress tolerance of arabidopsis
 <cit> . heat stress induced expression of ertca rapidly in the sensitive genotype of tomato
 <cit> . in the present study, the strong induction of ertca expression by heat stress in grape leaves provided another piece of evidence for its role in heat tolerance. many other transcription factor genes were also affected by heat stress and recovery in grape leaves, although their roles in heat tolerance are not clear. interestingly, the majority of heat response transcription factors genes were responsive to the heat treatment. most of them were downregulated. basic leucine zipper  transcription factors play a role in plant pathogen responses, light signaling, and aba and abiotic stress signaling
 <cit> . our microarray data revealed that bzip transcription factors were heat-regulated. some were upregulated, such as zinc finger protein-like, some were downregulated, such as b-box type zinc finger-containing protein. gata-type zinc finger protein was upregulated only by the recovery treatment . plant transcription factors wrkys have been reported in both biotic and abiotic stress responses
 <cit> . in this study, three wrky transcription factors were downregulated by heat stress, and two wrky transcription factors were downregulated by the recovery . these results suggested that several wrky factors could be involved in the heat response of grape leaves. our data indicated that expression of  <dig> transcription factors with nac domain genes were also heat–regulated. plant-specific nac family transcription factor has a conserved nac domain at the n-terminal of the protein and has been implicated in plant development
 <cit> . it was recently reported that several nac transcription factors were also involved in biotic and abiotic stress response
 <cit> .

signal transduction components
in our study,  <dig> genes for receptor-like kinases  were regulated by heat stress . rlk <dig> is induced by wounding, pathogen attack, and salicylic acid
 <cit> . recent work indicated that rlk <dig> plays an important role in abscisic acid  signal transduction
 <cit> . our results suggested that heat signal transduction in grape leaves shared, at least in part, some common pathways with other biotic, abiotic and aba stress signaling through these rlks. protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been reported in heat signal transduction. indeed, protein kinases and phosphatases with altered expression formed the largest group of genes. in addition, many protein phosphatases showed differential expression, suggesting that protein post-translation modification occurred during the heat response of grapevine leaves.

calcium is a universal signaling molecule in both animals and plants, and the transient increase of ca2+ level during heat stress is well-documented in plants
 <cit> . heat shock triggered cytosolic ca2+ bursts, which is transferred by ca2+ binding proteins  such as calmodulin , cam-related proteins, ca2+-dependent protein kinases , and calcineurin b-like protein , and then unregulated the expression of hsps, due to the dependence of the final step in hsf- mediated hsp expression on a ca2+ signal
 <cit> . in the present analysis, candidate genes encoding the components of calcium- or calmodulin-mediated signal pathways, including calnexin, calmodulin, and cdpks, were also heat- or recovery-regulated, suggesting a role of ca2+-mediated signals in the heat stress response. plant survival after severe environmental stress largely depends on the efficiency of recovery mechanisms. among the genes activated after recovery, we found a calmodulin gene. qrt-pcr indicated a  <dig> -fold induction of calmodulin transcript accumulation after the early response to salt stress
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here provides genome-wide expression profiles of grape leaves under heat stress and subsequent recovery. affymetrix grape genome array and qrt-pcr techniques were used to identify heat stress- and recovery-regulated genes which represented classic heat stress responsive and thermotolerance mechanisms. the present study highlighted the significant contribution and fundamental roles of transcriptional control in stress responses in grape leaves. we found that about 8% of total probe sets were responsive to heat stress and subsequent recovery in grape leaves. heat stress and recovery responses displayed differential gene expression changes. the number of heat stress-regulated genes was almost twice that of recovery-regulated genes. the responsive genes identified in this study belong to a large number of important factors and biological pathways, including those for cell rescue , protein fate , primary and secondary metabolism, transcription factors, signal transduction and development. of particular interest, hsps especially shsps, apx and galactinol synthase, may be very important to thermotolerance of grape leaves; hsf <dig> may be a key regulator for heat stress and recovery;, and, hsf <dig> and hsf <dig> may mainly function after recovery. these results provide novel insight into the grape leaf response to heat stress and have great implications for further studies on gene function annotation and molecular breeding.
