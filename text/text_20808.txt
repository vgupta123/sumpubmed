BACKGROUND
the immune system is of crucial importance to our health and survival. faced with pathogenic threats from outside as well as the rise of cancer cells from within, our immune defense must be able to cope with very diverse opponents. mammals have developed a diverse set of receptors that sense components derived from pathogens and damaged cells. amongst the best studied receptors are the so called pattern recognition receptors  like the toll-like receptor  family, rig-i-like receptor  family and the nod-like receptor  family of proteins  <cit> . in general, engagement of these receptors on immune cells results in their activation, like enhanced antigen presentation, inflammatory cytokine production and the acquisition of immune effector function  <cit> .

pathogen recognition through specific tlrs can be of crucial importance for the induction of protective immunity. for instance, tlr4-deficient mice are more susceptible for infections with neisseria meningitidis, e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, salmonella enteritidis, and klebsiella pneumonia  <cit> . in this regard, the immunological effects of tlr <dig> ligation are remarkably different compared to the other tlrs . firstly, tlr <dig> has been reported to direct the broadest repertoire of danger-associated molecular patterns from a large variety of pathogens, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites, but also endogenous proteins like heat shock protein  <dig>   <cit> . this broad range of recognition may be explained by the heterodimerization of tlr <dig> with either tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  however, the recent publication of the tlr1/ <dig> receptor-ligand crystal structure  <cit> , in combination with the extremely high affinity of tlr <dig> for its lipoprotein ligands  <cit> , increases the possibility that a number of putative tlr2-ligands have no intrinsic tlr2-activating capacities but were actually contaminated by lipoproteins  <cit> . secondly, tlr2-deficient mice are less susceptible to lethal infections with aspergillus fumigatus, yersinia enterocolitica or candida albicans, which is in contrast with e.g. tlr4-deficient mice  <cit> . in tlr2-deficient mice, resistance to c. albicans is mediated by a stronger th <dig> response due to diminished production of il- <dig> during the infectious challenge  <cit> . the distinct roles of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in immunomodulation was further emphasized by findings that tlr2-deficient mice experienced increased joint inflammation in preclinical rheumatoid arthritis  models, while tlr4-deficient mice were more resistant  <cit> . interestingly, the enhanced immunological responses in tlr2-deficient mice correlate with decreased numbers of tregs in these mice  <cit> . moreover, c. albicans induced proliferation and survival of tregs in a tlr2-dependent manner  <cit> .

different types of tregs have been characterized and these tregs are indispensable for the maintenance of immunologic self-tolerance and immune homeostasis  <cit> . the naturally occurring cd25+cd4+foxp3+ tregs are generated in the thymus and constitute about 5-15% of the peripheral cd4+ t cells in healthy animals and humans  <cit> . once naturally occurring tregs are activated via tcr-triggering, they are able to actively suppress the function of multiple immune cells, such as cd4+cd25-effector t cells  and antigen presenting cells . although these activities are essential for maintaining tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, their suppressive capacity may interfere with the development of a potential anti-tumor/anti-pathogen immune response, implicating the need for a mechanism that regulates tregs. we recently demonstrated that tlr <dig> triggering on tregs by pam3cys in combination with t-cell receptor  activation resulted in proliferation of the otherwise non-proliferating tregs and, importantly, the temporal abrogation of their suppressive capabilities  <cit> . after a resting period, the tregs regain their suppressive, non-proliferative phenotype, indicating this is a reversible process.

since tlr <dig> is widely expressed in immune cells, we now investigated the consequences of tlr2-signaling on different immune subsets involved in adaptive immune responses; apcs, teffs and tregs. we found increased tlr <dig> expression on activated immune cells. interestingly, although tlr <dig> triggering abrogated treg-mediated suppression of teff cell proliferation, tlr <dig> triggering was unable to restore effector cytokine secretion. in addition, we show that pam3cys acts on tregs, teffs and apcs to reverse the suppressive effects of tregs. similar results were found with the pathogen legionella pneumophila  containing potent tlr <dig> ligands  <cit> , emphasizing the crucial role of tlr <dig> in immunomodulation in infections.

RESULTS
tlr <dig> expression and effects on treg, teffs and dcs
to decipher the role of tlr <dig> in immune responses in more detail, the expression and function of tlr <dig> on cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs, cd4+ teffs and dcs were studied. expression of tlr <dig> is readily detected on the cell surface of freshly isolated dcs , while expression on freshly isolated cd4+ teffs and tregs is low or absent . in line with the data from liu et al.  <cit> , tlr <dig> expression is up-regulated upon activation of these t cells , and both cd4+ t cell populations continue to express tlr <dig> when cultured for several weeks with cd <dig> and pam3cys .

since the expression of tlr <dig> on these t cell subsets seems to be affected by their activation state, we investigated how tlr <dig> expression correlated to the functional responsiveness of dcs, teffs and tregs to the tlr <dig> ligand pam3cys. as shown in figure  <dig>  both freshly isolated tregs and naive teffs showed enhanced proliferation after cd <dig> stimulation in the presence of increasing amounts of tlr2-ligand, indicating pam3cys co-stimulated these t cells. in the absence of cd <dig> stimulation, no proliferation was observed on either teffs or tregs , which is in line with the absence of tlr <dig> up-regulation on these cells. analysis of the cultured cd4+ t cell subsets revealed that only the cultured tregs, not the cultured teff cells, remained responsive towards tlr <dig> stimulation. this finding is consistent with our current understanding that primed teff cells become less dependent on co-stimulatory signals, as has been described for cd <dig> stimulation.

tlr2-triggering was also highly effective in co-stimulating cytokine secretion in cd3-activated, freshly isolated teff cells . they predominantly produced il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifnγ, and cytokine production was gradually increased with increasing pam3cys concentrations. as expected, freshly isolated tregs did not produce any detectable levels of these cytokines . also the in vitro expanded tregs did not produce any cytokines while the in vitro cultured teff cells  already produced high amounts of cytokines in the absence of pam3cys . adding increasing amounts of pam3cys to these teff cells did not significantly affect cytokine production.

analysis of pam3cys-stimulated dcs indicated that they readily produce multiple cytokines, including high amounts of il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> . maximal cytokine production by dcs already reaches a plateau at relatively low amounts of pam3cys . overall, the tlr2-induced cytokine profiles of the freshly isolated teff cells and the dcs nicely correlate with a cytokine profile needed for the induction of an immune response  <cit> . collectively, these results show that tregs, dcs as well as teffs can express functional tlr <dig>  dcs are most capable of sensing low amounts of tlr <dig> ligand. in agreement with the current understanding that activated teff cells are less dependent of stimulation, we show that they are less sensitive to tlr <dig> co-stimulation than naive teff. in contrast, treg remain relatively unresponsive to tcr stimulation and rely on co-stimulation in order to enter a proliferative state.

effect of tlr <dig> triggering on treg function
recently, we as well as others reported that triggering of tlr <dig> on murine tregs with a relatively high dose of pam3cys in combination with tcr signaling induced significant proliferation in the otherwise non-proliferative treg subset  <cit> . strikingly, treg proliferation was accompanied by a temporal loss of the ability of the tregs to suppress the proliferation of the teff cells. to analyze the effects of tlr <dig> on treg function in more detail, we titrated increasing concentrations of the tlr2-ligand pam3cys in a suppression assay and determined its impact on teff cell proliferation and on cytokine production, using cfse-labeled tlr2-deficient teff cells co-cultured with wildtype tregs. in contrast to 3h-tritium-thymidine incorporation assay, the use of cfse-labeled teff cells allows to distinguish between treg and teff proliferation. as shown in figure 5a , very low tlr2-ligand concentrations  hardly affected the treg mediated suppression of teff proliferation. in line with our previous results, a higher dose of tlr2-ligands  induced a clear loss of treg suppressive activity as reflected by increased teff proliferation. the addition of tregs to the teff cell cultures blocked proliferation as well as cytokine production. in contrast to its effect on proliferative capacity, the addition of pam3cys to these cultures failed to restore cytokine production by teffs . these results indicate that with respect to treg mediated suppression of teff cells, suppression of proliferation and suppression of cytokine production should be regarded as two separate events.

effect of tlr <dig> triggering on immune cell subsets on treg mediated immune suppression
to determine the contribution of tlr <dig> triggering on the different cell types present in a suppression assay , we performed suppression assays combining cells isolated from tlr2-deficient mice and wildtype mice. this setup ensures that any of the observed effect of the tlr2-ligands is mediated through tlr <dig> triggering on the cells purified from the wildtype mice. we focused on treg-mediated suppression of teff proliferation as the read out system.

tlr <dig> triggering on wildtype tregs in the presence of tlr2-deficient teff and apc resulted in a 57% reduction in the suppression of teff cell proliferation . similarly, tlr2-signaling on teffs  or dc  inhibited treg-mediated suppression to 55% and 65% respectively. a similar level of reduction in suppression was also observed when all cells were derived from wildtype origin. control suppression assays performed with only tlr2-deficient cells demonstrated the specificity of the tlr2-effect . these data thus demonstrate that tlr <dig> is important in controlling activation of immune cells and that tlr <dig> acts on each of the three cell types present in the suppression assay; tregs, teffs and apcs.

effect of legionella pneumophila on immune cell proliferation, cytokine production and treg suppression
so far, the experiments were performed with the synthetic tlr <dig> ligand pam3cys. we repeated these experiments with the natural pathogen legionella pneumophila, which is known to contain high amounts of tlr <dig> ligands  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the proliferative capacity of the cultured teff cells and tregs were similar to the data found with pam3cys. the cultured teff cells were hardly responsive to the hklp, and this did not change upon increasing pathogen concentration. the naive cd4+ teff cells were highly responsive to hklp in a dose-dependent manner. both freshly-isolated and cultured teff produced ifn-γ upon hklp stimulation .

to further investigate the effect of hklp on treg, suppression assays were performed. the results shown in figure  <dig> indicate that hklp abrogated the treg-mediated suppressive capacity even in conditions where tregs are the only tlr <dig> expressing cells. these data imply that the immune modulatory effect of pam3cys can be mimicked by a natural pathogen containing high amounts of tlr <dig> ligand. it is likely that during normal infections of legionella pneumophila the suppressive capacity of the tregs can at least in part be abrogated by directly acting on the tregs themselves.

discussion
the complexity of signals received and produced by our immune system has puzzled immunologist for many years. the re-discovery of the suppressor t cells mostly indicated as tregs has increased our comprehension of immunity in health and disease. in immune homeostasis, immune activation events are kept in balance by many regulatory mechanisms like suppressors of cytokine signaling , ctla- <dig>  suppressive cytokines like il- <dig> and tgf-β, and importantly tregs. however during infections, strong immune activation signals are released, including a set of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. these pathogen derived determinants are able to induce the activation of amongst others tlrs, one of the main families of receptors involved in pattern recognition. this will result in a strong inflammatory immune response capable of dealing with the pathogenic challenge. more recently, tlr agonists have been shown to also act directly on treg and 'lift' the suppressive pressure on other immune cells. we demonstrated that tlr <dig> triggering on tregs in combination with tcr signaling induces proliferation of the tregs and reduces their suppressive capacity  <cit> . similar data were later reported by liu et al.  <cit> 
. recently oberg et al.  <cit> , examined the influence of different tlr <dig> ligands on human tregs. they show similar results for 75% of the used human donors, namely direct abrogation of the treg suppressive capacity. they also observed individual differences in efficacy between different tlr <dig> ligands. above all, zhang et al.  <cit>  currently tested the abrogation of treg-mediated suppression in an in vivo tumor-bearing mouse model. they report that injection of the mice in combination with pretreatment of the treg cells with pam3cys, induces a marked reduction of treg cells in the lymph nodes and a diminished suppressive activity of the remaining tregs present in these mice. on the contrary, another researcher group has published that tlr <dig> does not abrogate the treg suppressive function  <cit> . the different findings might be explained by the difference in model systems, cell sources, experimental setups and as described by oberg et al.  <cit>  the expression pattern of tlr1/tlr <dig> 

the loss of suppression by tlr <dig> triggering on treg facilitates the induction of adaptive immune responses. at the same time, tlr2-stimulated tregs expand and have been suggested to limit excessive tissue pathology and to prevent potential autoimmune events once the pathogen is efficiently cleared. to further assess the role of tlr <dig>  we investigated the effects of tlr <dig> stimulation on treg and other immune cells known to be involved in the adaptive immune response; teff cells and the professional antigen presenting dcs. freshly isolated splenic dcs express tlr <dig>  but the freshly isolated tregs and teff cells only express tlr <dig> upon activation. interestingly, all freshly isolated cells respond to the tlr2-ligand pam3cys, however after in vitro culturing, only the tregs remained responsive to tlr2-stimulation in lower concentrations. tlr <dig> on naive teff cells enhanced teff cell proliferation indicating that tlr <dig> acts as a co-stimulatory signal, similar to cd <dig>  cultured teff cells did not seem to respond to tlr <dig> triggering. these data are in line with the idea that primed teff cells are less dependent on co-stimulation by tlr <dig>  similar to co-stimulation by cd <dig>  though the anergic treg subset requires more than tcr triggering alone in order to enter a state of proliferation.

when analyzing the effects of tlr2-stimulation of tregs in more detail, we observed a difference between suppression of proliferation and suppression of cytokine production by the treg. interestingly, tlr2-treated treg still suppressed cytokine secretion, but lost their ability to suppress the proliferation of teff cells. apparently, the process of suppression of cytokine secretion is different from that of suppression of proliferation. this is in line with data of shevach et al. showing that mature dcs abrogated treg-mediated suppression of teff cell proliferation, while cytokine secretion was still suppressed  <cit> . moreover, dcs stimulated the proliferation of treg, similar as observed after tlr <dig> stimulation. it remains intriguing why such highly different signals  would yield similar phenotypes in the tregs. one possibility would be that the tregs require a certain threshold of co-stimulatory signals. indeed, it has been shown that tlr <dig> can substitute for cd <dig> with respect to co-stimulatory signals required for t cell stimulation  <cit> . once the combination of co-stimulatory signals and tcr triggering is sufficient, the treg will suppress only cytokine secretion by teff and will start to proliferate themselves. why would treg allow teff proliferation whilst inhibiting teff cytokine production? possibly cytokine secretion is a far more dangerous effector mechanism as compared to teff proliferation.

since tlr <dig> effected suppression of proliferation, we addressed the effects of tlr <dig> on each of the cellular subsets present during the suppression assay. our results show that tlr <dig> can abrogate the suppression of proliferation by acting on each subset being treg, teff or dc. tlr <dig> triggering on treg induces their proliferation and temporal inhibition of their suppressive capacity, while on teff cells tlr <dig> has a co-stimulatory role. tlr <dig> triggering on dcs results in the production of cytokines like il- <dig> that have been shown to release teff from treg mediated suppression  <cit> . we examined il- <dig> production in our co-culture experiments combining teffs, tregs and dcs for wild type and tlr2-knock out origin . although the presence of il- <dig> coincides with the abrogation of treg-mediated suppression of teff proliferation in the wild type conditions, teffs also start to proliferate when teffs/dcs are tlr2-deficient. we therefore conclude that il- <dig> is able to stimulate the proliferation of teffs but is not absolutely required for abrogation of treg-mediated suppression of teff proliferation. by acting on all multiple immune cell subsets involved in adaptive immunity, tlr <dig> stimulation launches an effective immune response. a potent increase of regulatory mechanisms will have to occur to suppress any potential autoimmune events. the observed expansion of tregs following immune activation shown here and in our previous work represents one of these feed-back mechanisms. the increased expansion of treg may prevent immune pathology and help to dampen the immune response once the cause of the immune challenge has been eliminated.

the question arose whether the effect of synthetic tlr <dig> ligand could also be observed during natural infections. the gram-negative micro-organism legionella pneumophila is the causing agent of a severe pneumonia. immune recognition of this microorganism has been reported to be dependent on tlr <dig> signaling and not on tlr <dig> signaling  <cit> . therefore we repeated the experiments with heat-killed legionella pneumophila  to confirm our pam3cys findings. indeed the effect of tlr <dig> triggering on all different immune cells could be confirmed when using hklp in our assays. most importantly the suppressive capacity of the tregs could be abrogated in the presence of hklp. these data indicate that tlr <dig> triggering potently modulates immune function during bacterial infections. however, it should be considered that besides effects on tlr <dig>  stimulation of other pathogen recognition receptors could drastically influence the outcome of induced immune responses against specific pathogens. recognition of legionella pneumophila is mainly relying on tlr <dig> triggering. other pathogens likely trigger other receptors that could possibly effect treg suppression.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that treg-mediated suppression of t helper cell proliferation is functionally distinct from suppression of cytokine secretion. tlr <dig> acts on multiple cells of the adaptive and innate immune system thereby providing direct immune stimulation of teffs and dcs while simultaneously inhibiting the suppressive abilities of tregs. these effects are not only observed for a synthetic tlr <dig> ligand, but could be confirmed with the natural tlr <dig> ligand containing bacteria legionella pneumophilia. further understanding of the precise mechanisms involved, will most likely contribute to new strategies for immune-based intervention strategies.
