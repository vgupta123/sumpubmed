BACKGROUND
drug resistance often results from a mutation in a specific gene, such as a drug target or a drug transporter. the emergence of a resistance-conferring mutation within an evolutionary tuned system of functional and physical interactions can present enormous physiological challenges and can have broad phenotypic effects. for example, mutations in a single drug resistance gene can impact its interactions with other genes, physically and/or functionally, and can in turn constrain the evolution of highly connected genes  <cit> . such interactions can affect the penetrance, expressivity and pleiotropic phenotypic effects of a single mutation  <cit> . moreover, the spread of resistance alleles in populations creates novel interactions with accompanying fitness implications, as mutations recombine in new genetic backgrounds, sometimes decoupling co-evolved gene relationships. in some cases, recombination brings together beneficial alleles into one genome while in others, suboptimal combinations result  <cit> . the successful propagation of mutations from small founder populations implies that cells have mechanisms to buffer the impact of single gene mutations on their interaction partners. notably, even when phenotypes such as drug resistance are controlled by a single major gene, individuals carrying the same genotype at that locus commonly present a range of phenotype levels  <cit> .

chloroquine  resistance is a prime example of the complexity of the evolutionary impact of mutations in a single drug resistance gene. all cq-resistant  parasites reported to date contain a lysine to threonine substitution  in the p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter, pfcrt  <cit> . in spite of the high penetrance of this mutation, cqr parasites exhibit a wide range of resistance levels, indicating the involvement of additional genes  <cit> . furthermore, the lone example of selection of cq resistance in the laboratory was highly dependent on the genetic background that was drug pressured  <cit> . unfortunately, in more than a decade since the association between pfcrt and cq resistance was discovered  <cit> , information about its extended functions, regulation and impact on other phenotypes or drug resistance evolution remain largely unknown. an understanding of pfcrt’s interaction partners could reveal genetic modifiers of cq resistance and potential pleiotropic effects of the mutation.

the plasticity of gene regulation networks makes them powerful readouts of genome-wide responses to perturbations; moreover, global gene expression measurement is relatively simple, highly quantitative and unbiased view of regulatory outputs.

here, we leverage gene expression data from cqr and cq-sensitive  recombinant progeny clones to gain deeper insight into the biology of the pfcrt gene. we extend our work on genome-wide transcriptional profiling that found heritable regulatory variation controlling the expression of nearly 18% of the transcriptome  <cit> . the genetic locus encoding pfcrt emerged as a regulatory hotspot, suggesting that the associated transcriptional networks can provide more insights into its natural function and role in cq resistance  <cit> . we leverage pfcrt’s co-expression relationships to examine its functional interactions in cqr vs cqs parasites and to predict regulatory and phenotypic divergence across the phenotypically distinct recombinant progeny clones.

RESULTS
in this study, we determine and compare gene sets that are co-expressed with the drug resistance transporter gene, pfcrt, in cqr vs cqs malaria parasites  for three key reasons: i) genes showing similar patterns of co-expression often are functionally related  <cit>  such that pfcrt’s co-expressed genes could highlight its endogenous roles and functions beyond its role in resistance; ii) differentially co-expressed genes could lead to divergent drug response and other phenotypes <cit> ; iii) because differential co-expression results from divergent regulation  <cit> , the topological relationships between differentially co-expressed gene sets can reveal regulatory mediators of phenotypes  <cit> . differential gene expression, the usual method for analyzing transcriptional data, cannot effectively address these questions because that approach considers genes individually rather than in context of their relationships  <cit> . recently, gene co-expression networks have been used to distil information from transcriptional data to identify functional and regulatory interactions between genes, even when the key genes are not differentially expressed  <cit> . their usefulness notwithstanding, co-expression networks are prone to a high rate of false positive correlations arising from indirect relationships between genes, requiring that we establish rigorous thresholds and a layered  method   <cit> . specifically, to overcome false positive correlations, we develop an approach - triangle inequality prioritization of interactions  - that, given a correlation matrix of genes significantly correlated to a gene of interest , prioritizes sets of correlated genes into ‘direct’ functional partners of the gene and potential regulators of its co-expression network . this method has  <dig> key advantages: i) it takes advantage of prior biological information by focusing on a gene of interest  to reduce the dimensionality of the hypothesis search space for significant gene correlations , ii) it prioritizes correlations between the gene of interest and other genes by examining the strength of the correlation in the context of how the two genes correlate to other genes, paring out indirect associations and thereby reducing false positive associations , and iii) it interrogates the topological relationships to identify candidate regulatory factors which are gene that correlate significantly to a high fraction of the direct neighbors of the gene of interest . a comprehensive overview of the approach is provided in the additional file 1: sections a, c and d. we apply this approach to predict candidate functional partners of pfcrt, drivers of its co-expression network and to provide molecular insights for phenotypic divergence between cqr and cqs parasite clones.figure  <dig>

pfcrt co-expression networks in cqr and cqs recombinants
to determine the co-expression relationship between pfcrt and other genes, we reanalyzed microarray data from our lab that profiled transcripts at 18 hr post-erythrocye invasion of  <dig> cqs and  <dig> cqr recombinant progeny of a cross between the cqr parent dd <dig> and the cqs clone hb <dig>   <cit> . each gene was considered as co-expressed with pfcrt if the absolute spearman correlation coefficient threshold, |r|, between the transcript levels of the two genes exceeded a threshold of  <dig>   across all cqr or cqs parasites. of the  <dig> genes in the p. falciparum genome for which transcript level data were available, transcripts for  <dig>  genes were co-expressed with pfcrt in cqr progeny and  <dig>  in cqs parasites . of the genes that were co-expressed with pfcrt,  <dig>  genes that were co-expressed with pfcrt in cqs parasites also were co-expressed with the gene in cqr;  <dig>  would be expected by chance . we reasoned that if these observations are biologically meaningful, then gene pairs under high evolutionary constraint would show limited co-expression divergence in the two parasite groups. synthetic lethal interactions are known to be under such a constraint  <cit> : in such cases, deletion of either single gene partner is compatible with growth because the second gene can buffer the loss of the first. however, the simultaneous deletion of the interacting gene leads to death. the ability of such genes to buffer mutations in their counterpart is influenced by the negative regulatory relationships that exist between them  <cit> . of  <dig> synthetic lethal gene pairs determined by flux balance analysis  <cit> ,  <dig> are significantly co-expressed  in cqs parasites, and one of these  <dig> pairs also is co-expressed in cqr parasites . that is, when considering co-expression between synthetic lethal pairs, half of the observable co-expression relationships are conserved between the  <dig> networks compared to 30% in  <dig> random gene pairs; however, given only two co-expressed synthetic lethal pairs, this observation is of limited value. to follow this point further, we observed that co-expressed synthetic lethal pairs in both cqs and cqr parasites are negatively correlated as expected for synthetic lethal pairs . no such skew towards negative correlation is observed in randomly selected gene pairs . this led us to hypothesize that, if pfcrt genotype constrains pfcrt co-expression, then the divergence of pfcrt co-expression networks should be much lower within subsets of cqs or cqr progeny than between the two parasite groups. the divergence between cqr and cqs progeny  compared to within each parasite group  is much higher: while only 30% of pfcrt co-expressed genes are similarly co-expressed between cqr and cqs progeny, this percentage rises to 57% when comparing co-expression between randomly sampled subsets of cqr or cqs . the divergence within each group is not statistically significant , while the divergence between the groups is highly significant . in addition, a very strong correlation is observed between the correlations of pfcrt and other genes within cqr or cqs subsets  compared to between cqr and cqs subsets  . together these observations indicate that different pfcrt genotypes are associated with functionally relevant differential co-expression.figure  <dig>

co-expression partners of pfcrt suggest biological functions
genes involved in related biological pathways are often co-expressed and this co-expression can result from a shared regulatory program such that co-regulated genes are co-expressed . as a first step to connecting genes in a transcription network, a rigorous threshold is often applied to identify non-random correlations. however, even given this initial filter, relationships between gene pairs have a strong potential to be artifacts due to intermediate/ indirect correlations . while these secondary correlations may be biologically relevant, the rate of false positives is unacceptably high for drawing functional inferences. our tripi method was developed to identify and remove these third party interactions by leveraging the local network structure of gene neighborhoods to prioritize interactions . briefly, for a given gene, r, tripi applies the triangle inequality  <cit>  to find gene nodes potentially indirectly linking r to pfcrt. when no indirect links between r and pfcrt can be found, r is regarded as a functional partner of pfcrt and assigned a transitivity score, t, of zero with respect to pfcrt. using this method, we found  <dig> high-level candidate pfcrt functional partners in cqs and  <dig> functional partners in cqr parasites . a small but significant set of  <dig> genes was present in both cqr and cqs .table  <dig>

while pfcrt’s biological function is unknown, it has been proposed to be associated with the catabolism of hemoglobin-derived peptides in the parasite digestive vacuole   <cit> . these peptides are released from hemoglobin digestion by the action of proteases known as plasmepsins  <cit>  and falcipains  <cit>  in the dv. once outside the dv, the peptides are broken down into amino acids for protein synthesis  <cit> . cq interferes with the detoxification of heme  <cit>  and resistance to cq is associated with accumulation of hemoglobin derived peptides in the dv of cqr parasites, implying that hemoglobin catabolism is impaired in cqr  <cit> .

in both cqr and cqs pfcrt functional partners, we observed three genes encoding hemoglobin-degrading aspartyl proteases. two of these  were predicted by our method as pfcrt functional partners in cqr parasites, while plasmepsin ix was identified as a functional partner in cqs lines. with only  <dig> plasmepsin genes in p. falciparum, this observation is unlikely by chance . the presence of distinct but functionally related hemoglobin-degrading enzymes in cqr and cqs pfcrt functional partners is consistent with the interpretation that this functional relationship is preserved in both co-expression networks. one explanation for this could be that the link between pfcrt and the plasmepsins is vital for growth supporting processes. the paralogs may present alternative routes by which parasite lines carrying different pfcrt alleles could mediate this essential function. we further observed other biological functions shared by pfcrt partners in both cqr and cqs, including heme biosynthesis and lipoamide biosynthesis, for which distinct but functionally related genes were identified as both cqr and cqs pfcrt functional partners. for heme biosynthesis, pfcrt functional partners in cqs contained the gene encoding the enzyme ferrochelatase , which catalyzes the terminal step in the pathway. cqr functional partners contained two genes: delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase , a metabolic chokepoint in the pathway, and a putative cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid binding protein . notably, heme biosynthesis occurs in the mitochondrion and the plastid organelle , while pfcrt is localized to the dv. both of these organelles are centers for heme metabolism: heme is a byproduct of hemoglobin digestion in the dv and a synthetic metabolite in the mitochondrion.

a more surprising biological process showing functional conservation in cqr and cqs was the shared co-expression between pfcrt and lipoamide synthesis genes. lipoate ligase  was a direct  partner of pfcrt in cqs and lipoamide dehydrogenase  was a predicted functional partner in cqr. the co-expression networks are consistent with a functional association connecting cq, pfcrt and hemoglobin digestion, and also reveal novel associations that will need future validations.

ap <dig> transcription factors connect pfcrt co-expressed genes
because topological relationships between genes in the pfcrt co-expression networks can highlight potential regulators, we developed a scheme to identify candidate regulators on the basis of their connections to a large number of pfcrt neighbors in the network, reflecting the tendency of regulatory genes to reside in the shortest paths in networks  <cit> . the tripi method, in addition to identifying direct partners  is also suited to identify genes with high transitivity to pfcrt; specifically, these are genes that provide a short path connecting pfcrt neighbors . to prioritize candidate regulators, we ranked genes by their transitivity.

strikingly, out of  <dig> genes significantly correlated to pfcrt in cqs, the gene with the highest transitivity  in cqs parasites is an apicomplexan  ap <dig> transcription factor , a member of the developmentally regulated apiap <dig> transcription factor family  <cit> . this gene was significantly correlated to pfcrt in cqs parasites  but not in cqr  parasites. in cqr parasites, a different ap <dig> transcription factor gene, pf3d7_ <dig>  exhibited the third highest transitivity  of  <dig> genes significantly correlated to pfcrt. given that  <dig> genes in the p. falciparum genome encode ap <dig> transcription factors, the likelihood of randomly observing  <dig> ap <dig> genes within the top  <dig> genes from each list is extremely small . these regulators bind similar motifs  <cit> : the consensus motif for the second domain of the cqr ap <dig> is gtgttacac compared to gtgcac of the third domain of the cqs ap <dig>  <cit> , differing by a 3 bp central indel . it is plausible that a minor mutational event that alters their target binding specificity could facilitate a swap of regulatory programs, and lead to broad physiological and phenotypic effects mediated by their specific targets. notably, a third ap <dig>  was predicted as a direct functional pfcrt partner  in cqr but not cqs parasites . in contrast to the two other ap2s, this ap <dig> is directly connected to pfcrt, implying its more restricted role within the immediate pfcrt co-expression network.

because transcription factors regulate many genes, their divergent co-expression would also be expected to have pleiotropic effects. accordingly, we developed a comprehensive gene co-expression network from an independently-derived high-dimensional transcription dataset that both validated and expanded our view of potential targets of the candidate regulators of the co-expression divergence . this network was constructed using the well-established reverse engineering algorithm, aracne  <cit> , applied to a transcriptional data set obtained from  <dig> parasite samples cultured under a wide range of conditions  <cit> ; from this network we computed the set of all direct links  of the candidate regulators. this approach offers several advantages: it is outside of the constraints of the genetic cross and is not dependent on pfcrt-anchored correlations; it also provides a more general representation of genome-wide interactions using a different statistical method .

the cqs-related ap <dig>  regulon contains  <dig> genes and is enriched for functions we observed in our pfcrt-based networks: hemoglobin degrading enzymes plasmepsin i  and falcilysin  as well as the heme biosynthesis enzyme delta-aminolevunilic acid  . the predicted regulon of the cqr ap <dig> contains  <dig> genes enriched with dna mismatch repair .

candidate ap <dig> regulators are linked to histone acetylation
the divergent co-expression of  <dig> ap <dig> transcription factor genes in the pfcrt co-expression networks led us to investigate their functional relationships . while limited information is available about these regulators ,  <cit> , we were intrigued to note that lacount et al.  <cit>  identified physical interactions among them as part of a high confidence protein-protein interaction subnetwork centered on the histone acetyltransferase, gcn <dig>  and containing additional chromatin-modifying proteins   <cit> . the interactions among these transcription factors and gcn5-containing complexes suggest that the ap2s interface with histone acetylation in their regulatory roles. these interactions also have been observed in toxoplasma  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . that these associations may extend to regulatory relationships is implied by the up-regulation of the ap <dig> genes following perturbations by apicidin, a histone deacetylase inhibitor   <cit> . consistent with these observations, the predicted regulon of the ap <dig> in the cqs pfcrt network  includes gcn <dig>  ccr <dig> and two hypothetical proteins  that are also members of the gcn <dig> protein-protein interaction sub-network  <cit> . moreover, the gcn <dig> regulon contains ada <dig> and ccr <dig> associated factor  <dig>  which are integral components of the ccr4-not complex, a regulator of mrna stability and transcriptional regulation  <cit> .figure  <dig>

we hypothesized that the association between the cqs ap <dig>  and gcn <dig>  found in both the protein-protein interaction complex  and in their regulons that were constructed independent of the protein-protein network, predicts that dys-regulation of histone acetylation in cqr parasites. this dysregulation could manifest as differential sensitivity to perturbations by histone acetylation/ deacetylation inhibitors. to test this idea, we performed quantitative dose response assays on the cqr and cqs recombinant progeny clones using the hdaci- apicidin. the parasites exhibited a range of sensitivities  and qtl analysis  provided insights into the molecular basis of this differential sensitivity. two genetic loci, on chromosome  <dig>  and a suggestive peak on chromosome  <dig>  are associated with the level of apicidin response . genes lying between genetic markers flanking the 95% confidence range of each qtl peak were regarded as potential candidates.

the chromosome  <dig> locus contains a putative ccr <dig> gene and the chromosome  <dig> locus includes the caf <dig> gene. caf <dig> physically interacts with both gcn <dig> and the ap <dig> predicted to be a functional partner of pfcrt in cqr   <cit> ; it resides within a protein-protein interaction complex that includes the two regulatory candidates identified in our networks  . these data point to a possible role of these ap2s in dysregulation of the gcn <dig> network, resulting into an altered response to hdaci. a better understanding of how these ap2s interface with histone acetylation will require functional assays of the interactions between these components that differ in cqr and cqs parasites.

promoters of differentially co-expressed genes have distinct epigenetic profiles
the physical interactions between the ap <dig> regulators with gcn <dig> coupled to the heritable variation in dose response to apicidin  collectively imply divergent histone acetylation in the recombinant progeny clones. therefore, we hypothesized that differentially co-expressed pfcrt interacting genes between cqr and cqs parasites would differ in histone acetylation patterns. to test this, we partitioned genes into categories of extreme differential co-expression in cqr vs cqs. specifically, we identified genes that gained or lost correlations  with pfcrt in cqr parasites relative to cqs. we then asked whether the promoters of genes that lost or gained correlation with pfcrt exhibited distinct histone acetylation profiles. for each category, we considered the top  <dig> genes and examined histone acetylation patterns in the 1000 bp upstream of translation start site using a publicly available dataset  <cit> . genes that gained positive correlation had higher levels of the acetylated histone h3k9ac in their promoters while those that gained negative correlation had lower levels of this histone modification compared to the genome baseline . promoters of genes that lost positive correlation were no different from the genome baseline  while those that lost negative correlation were significantly different from the baseline, particularly in the - <dig> to -500 bp upstream region . these data further support our conclusion that the cqr and cqs progeny have divergent regulatory processes involving transcription factors and epigenetic modifications.

divergent co-expression networks predict diverging phenotypes
we reasoned that co-expression networks, particularly the genes with marked differential co-expression between cqr and cqs could predict additional phenotypic differences between the two groups of recombinant progeny, as was observed for the qtl associated with apicidin dose response . besides differences in cq susceptibility, recombinants of the dd2 × hb <dig> genetic cross differ for other phenotypes. for example, genetic association mapping of quantitative dose responses showed that the pfcrt locus is associated with response to more than  <dig> compounds  <cit> . other studies suggest that the h+ physiology of the dv is altered in cqr, although how this affects compartmental ph  <cit>  and vacuolar volume  <cit>  are still debated  <cit> . evidence suggests that, in cqr parasites, cq effluxes from the dv in conjunction with h+ via a verapamil-sensitive pathway  <cit> .

an altered co-expression network could account for some of these unexplained broader phenotypic changes associated with the pfcrt mutation. in cqr but not cqs networks, components of ph regulation were specifically enriched in the pfcrt functional partners . for example, transcript levels of the v-type h+ translocating pyrophosphatase , involved in ph regulation was a functional partner of pfcrt  in cqr but not cqs progeny. co-expression of the two genes could compensate for the loss of proton levels during cq efflux in cqr strains  <cit>  by increasing influx of hydrogen ions into the dv.

altered co-expression networks are associated with mmr dysregulation in cqr parasites
as outlined above , co-expression changes can compromise normal functional associations between genes, thereby altering cellular response to secondary perturbations and exposing drug unique susceptibilities specifically in cqr parasites. for example, the co-expression constraint described for synthetic lethal gene pairs implies that dysregulation of their coordinated expression is incompatible with their normal ability to compensate for each other  <cit>  . a well-documented case of this effect involves the synthetic lethal gene pair tbx- <dig> and tbx- <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . deletion of tbx- <dig> results in an incompletely penetrant phenotype in which individuals expressing high levels of tbx- <dig> exhibit the wild-type phenotype, while those expressing low levels produce an abnormal phenotype  <cit> . high expression of tbx- <dig> buffers deletion of tbx- <dig>  this buffering effect is lost in individuals expressing low levels of tbx- <dig>  making these individuals vulnerable to disruption of tbx- <dig>  <cit> .

we searched the functional partners of pfcrt having an altered co-expression in cqr vs cqs for genes encoding druggable proteins or genes in pathways associated with antimalarial drug resistance. the mismatch repair  pathway meets these criteria: the gene encoding the dna mmr protein  is a functional partner of pfcrt in cqs but not cqr parasites  and this pathway can be induced by small molecules such as methyl methanesulfonate   <cit> . we predicted that the cqr genetic background may be differentially susceptible to perturbations of this pathway. to test this prediction, we performed quantitative dose–response assays to mms  <cit>  and found that the parental line dd <dig> and the cqs line hb <dig> were similarly sensitive to growth inhibition by mms, but their progeny clones exhibited a range of susceptibility to the drug . qtl mapping of the quantitative susceptibility to mms of the progeny identified genetic loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  cm  and  <dig>  20 cm  . suggestive peaks also occurred at chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  cm  and  <dig>  23 cm .figure  <dig>

importantly, msh <dig> resides within the physical location of the chromosome  <dig> qtl . strikingly, the chromosome  <dig> qtl includes the ap <dig> transcription factor gene which we predicted as a regulator of the cqr pfcrt co-expression network . a closer examination of the predicted targets of this transcription factor  identifies  <dig> genes functionally enriched for dna repair . target genes of this transcription factor with a direct role in dna repair include an msh <dig> homolog , rad <dig> homolog , deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidylhydrolase , nucleoside diphosphate kinase  and dna topoisomerase ii . this independently-derived network strongly supports the prediction that this ap <dig> transcription factor drives the connection between divergent pfcrt co-expression and mms response .

the association between genetic loci encoding the predicted ap <dig> regulator of the pfcrt co-expression network, pf3d7_ <dig>  and the divergently co-expressed msh <dig> with mms response highlights the value of a generalized application of divergent co-expression networks for predicting phenotypic outcomes, for example, drug responses of specific groups of parasites.

discussion
we constructed pfcrt co-expression networks that differ between cqr and cqs parasites and mined these networks to show that: i) consistently co-expressed gene sets across the recombinant progeny clones of both drug resistance states reflect core shared functions, chiefly hemoglobin metabolism, in line with proposed pfcrt function, cq modes of action and resistance, ii) the topologies of these  <dig> co-expression networks are held together by  <dig> transcriptional regulators from the same family , possibly interfacing with histone acetylation , iii) divergent co-expression networks can be useful predictors of phenotypic divergence, as demonstrated here by the association between the genetic loci encoding the divergent processes  and dose response variation to small molecules targeting these processes .

our results indicate that co-expression networks can generate extensive but cryptic variation. such variation would be undetectable by genome sequencing, the principal method used to track parasite evolution and emergence of drug resistance. the dysregulation of regulatory networks can affect multiple target genes, thereby providing a molecular explanation for broad  phenotypic differences. we predicted and validated that dysregulation of dna repair is associated with divergent co-expression of msh <dig>  interestingly, the cqr parental clone dd <dig> was derived from an indochina clone, w <dig>  which exhibits an accelerated resistance to multiple drugs  in laboratory experiments  <cit> . given that co-expression relationships are known to buffer deleterious mutations  <cit> , we propose that differential co-expression of genes associated with drug response can expose drug resistant parasites to susceptibilities to specific drugs .

we envision that the regulatory divergence between cqr and cqs could involve at least  <dig> mechanisms : i) a regulon swap in which the mutant pfcrt gene is recruited into a new regulatory program by cis-mutations or by alterations of histone acetylation marks in its promoter , and/or ii) a physiologically mediated mechanism in which mutant pfcrt has an additional metabolic effect, for example the verapamil sensitive h+ associated leak  <cit> , that could activate downstream transcriptional regulators . genome sequence data of the progeny clones combined with histone modification data sets will be important in experimentally validating the regulatory basis of the co-expression divergence in cqr and cqs parasites.

our observations are constrained by the fact that all datasets used in this study were obtained from recombinant progeny clones from a single genetic cross. therefore, the genetic diversity observed in this data set does not fully capture the diversity of cqr and cqs parasites in the field. further studies using field isolates will be crucial in leveraging and extending co-expression networks to understand molecular changes associated with drug resistance, particularly the devastating emergence of artemisinin resistance in southeast asia  <cit>  and other phenotypic states for which the primary causal genes are known.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that pfcrt is differentially co-expressed in cqr parasites as compared to cqs parasites. this differential co-expression reveals biological pathways that are divergent in cqr parasites and regulatory processes underlying the differential co-expression. we validate that two key biological processes associated with the differentially co-expressed pfcrt partners – dna mmr pathway and histone acetylation- are linked to differential responses to small molecules targeting these processes. we conclude that co-expression divergence can complement traditional genetic and molecular approaches to uncovering the molecular basis of phenotypic divergence as well as predicting phenotypic outcomes.
