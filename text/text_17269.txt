BACKGROUND
tb is an enormous public health challenge worldwide, with an estimated global incidence of  <dig> % in  <dig>  <cit>  which is likely to be aggravated by the hiv/aids pandemic. therefore there is great pressure on clinical laboratories to rapidly and accurately detect and identify clinically important mycobacteria. tb is routinely diagnosed worldwide by smear microscopy and culture. in spite of its lack of sensitivity and inability to distinguish between tubercle bacilli and other mycobacteria, the former technique is widely used in tb control programmes on account of its speed, simplicity and low cost. apart from lungs, tb also occurs in other body sites wherein the paucibacillary load often poses a significant diagnostic challenge  <cit> . nucleic acid amplification technologies are being intensively assessed in diagnosing extrapulmonary tb owing to their speed, specificity and sensitivity  <cit> . however their application is limited to sophisticated laboratories in developing countries including india and samples are often stored prior to analysis. studies that have evaluated the effect of sample shipment and storage on the performance of conventional and nucleic acids-based tests concluded that accurate diagnosis rests on minimal transport time and lowest possible storage and shipping temperatures  <cit> . furthermore, in case of paucibacillary specimens, diagnostic methods are no different from those employed for high load or fresh samples. the inherent delay in obtaining culture results is a serious limitation of the gold standard; therefore it was proposed that when smear microscopy and dna amplification were both positive, the diagnosis of active tb could be considered established  <cit> . for these various reasons pcr is being increasingly considered as an adjunct test for diagnosing tb in resource-poor settings also.

we developed a sample processing procedure, usp methodology, that is compatible with microbiology and inhibition-free pcr in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary samples  <cit> . in the present study, we assessed the effect of low temperature storage on the efficacy of m. tuberculosis detection in fresh and stored usp-processed sputum. the key finding was that a significant number of fresh specimens contained lysed mycobacteria and lysis increased during storage. as a consequence supernatant pcr positivity increased with sample storage. thus supernatant is a novel and useful sample for enhancing pcr performance in clinical samples.

RESULTS
in a preliminary study conducted to assess the impact of sputum storage on pcr, maximum bacterial autolysis in untreated samples was noted during room temperature vs. 4°c or -20°c storage . the present study was designed to assess the effect of storage at -20°c of nalc-treated sputum on bacterial lysis. we chose  <dig> and  <dig> months of storage as it exceeded the likely interval between sample collection and pcr analysis. pcr and smear microscopy were employed to assess the speed of storage-associated changes in bacterial load. bacterial lysis was confirmed by simultaneous analysis of sputum supernatants that are conventionally discarded

effect of sample storage on pcr
all the samples were processed as outlined in fig.  <dig>  a total of  <dig> is <dig> pcr assays were performed on  <dig> sputum aliquots prepared from  <dig> sputum specimens . all bacterial sediments remained pcr positive after  <dig> months of storage with the exception of a single sample. from these results it was inferred that bacterial lysis did not occur in smear positive stored samples to an extent that altered the outcome of pcr. the high sensitivity of pcr in stored bacterial sediments was attributed to either the initial high bacillary load  or to the resistance of tubercle bacilli to a cycle of freeze/thaw or both. sputum storage was associated with a decrease in dna recovery from the sediment fractions; random analysis of a subset of samples by is <dig> pcr  and devr pcr  indicated a reduction in dna amplification efficiency from stored vs. freshly processed sediments  which suggested the occurrence of bacterial lysis during storage.

bacterial lysis was confirmed by m. tuberculosis dna detection in the supernatant fraction that is normally discarded during processing;  <dig> of  <dig> supernatants  were pcr positive among fresh aliquots. in stored samples, the number of pcr positive supernatants increased to  <dig>  and  <dig>  after  <dig> month and  <dig> months, respectively  that was statistically significant . a representative result of pcr amplification from supernatants is shown in fig.  <dig>  we concluded that even fresh samples contained lysed bacteria and that dna lost due to storage-associated bacterial lysis from the sediment was recovered in the supernatant fraction.

effect of sample storage on usp smear status
a total of  <dig> slides prepared from  <dig> specimens  were examined by smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli. each slide was independently read by at least  <dig> well-trained technicians in a blinded manner. the sputum were graded as 3+ , 2+  and 1+ . no sample with a scanty or negative grade status was obtained . all the specimens remained smear-positive during  <dig> month of storage and only  <dig> specimen  turned smear-negative after  <dig> months. thus storage and one cycle of freeze/thaw did not substantially affect usp smear positivity per se. however, a decrease in "smear grade" status upon storage was noted in  <dig> of the  <dig> samples which included  <dig> samples of 3+,  <dig> samples of 2+ and  <dig> samples of 1+ smear grades. the decrease was more evident in the case of 2+ and 1+ samples as even a small decrease in bacterial number resulted in a change in smear grade. the decrease in the number of samples of a particular grade  upon storage was accompanied by a significant increase  in the number of samples belonging to the lower grades .

effect of sample storage on bacterial load
the remaining  <dig> of  <dig> samples that preserved their smear grade during storage were assessed for storage-associated changes in bacterial load. thirty-seven samples showed a decrease in bacterial number. in the 3+ slides , the median number of bacilli was  <dig> in fresh samples which reduced to  <dig> and  <dig> after  <dig> month and  <dig> months of storage, respectively. the decrease in bacterial load from fresh to  <dig> month, from  <dig> month to  <dig> months of storage and from fresh to  <dig> months of storage were statistically significant . a similar trend of reducing bacterial numbers upon storage was also noted in 2+ slides ; the median number of bacilli in fresh specimens was  <dig> and reduced to  <dig> and  <dig> upon  <dig> month and  <dig> months of storage, respectively . these changes were also statistically significant . the 1+ smear grade specimens  also showed storage associated decrease in afb load whose statistical significance was not assessed on account of the small number of samples studied.

discussion
we made several noteworthy conclusions in this study that evaluated the impact of sputum storage on the speed at which bacteria underwent autolysis and released dna in the supernatant. firstly, our results indicate that delays of upto a month do not adversely affect pcr and smear microscopy results. secondly, although a statistically significant decline in smear grades was observed on storage only  <dig> sample changed from smear-positive to -negative upon storage. the apparent negligible effect of storage on the sensitivity of smear microscopy was attributed to  the use of highly sensitive usp smear microscopy  and  a high initial bacterial load. thirdly, the pcr status of sediments was not altered with storage perhaps due to a high initial bacterial load, use of the multicopy is <dig> target assay and the addition of more template dna in pcr . the final and most significant finding was that dna was recovered from supernatants from the majority of freshly processed samples. additional lysis occurred during storage and was reflected by an increase in the number of pcr positive supernatants. since the sputum was stored after nalc processing, dna retrieved from the supernatant fraction thereafter  was derived solely from bacteria lysed during storage and/or subsequent thawing. for the sample that turned smear-negative and sediment pcr-negative after storage; supernatant pcr that was initially negative turned positive after storage. thus, the dna lost from pellet was retrieved in the supernatant. this observation assumes significance in paucibacillary specimens that are generally subjected to a concentration step before analysis. thus, supernatants that are conventionally discarded during sample processing would be a valuable specimen for pcr testing and offset the disadvantage associated with analyzing stored or low-load samples.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that performing supernatant pcr in addition to sediment pcr and highly sensitive usp smear microscopy would increase the efficiency of tb diagnosis in case of fresh and stored paucibacillary specimens.
