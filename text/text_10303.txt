BACKGROUND
xylan is the major constituent of hemicellulose and the second most abundant renewable resource in nature. xylan serves as the source of c- <dig> sugars used in the production of biofuels, xylooligosaccharides or other chemicals  <cit> . xylan generally contains heterogeneous substituents such as l-arabinose, o-acetyl, ferulic  acid, p-coumaric  acid and 4-o-methyl-d-glucuronic acid  <cit> . therefore, complete hydrolysis of xylans requires not only glycoside hydrolases , but also deacetylating enzymes, namely, acetyl xylan esterases , and other side substituent cleaving enzymes, including α-l-arabinofuranosidases , α-glucuronidases  and ferulic/coumaric acid esterases   <cit> . acetylation of the xylan backbone was thought to be a major obstacle to enzymatic decomposition  <cit> . the role of acetyl xylan esterases  is to remove acetyl groups and create new sites for productive binding of glycoside hydrolases, consequently enhancing xylan accessibility and enabling complete hydrolysis  <cit> .

synergistic actions between xylanases and acetyl xylan esterases have been reported. an acetyl xylan esterase  from neocallimastix patriciarum showed a significant synergistic effect in combination with a recombinant xylanase  on the degradation of delignined spear grass. more reducing sugars were released by adding bnaa and xyna simultaneously than by xyna alone  <cit> . tong et al.  <cit>  found that the overall xylose yield from wheat arabinoxylan hydrolysis was 8 % with xylanase treatment and increased to 34 % when xylanase was combined with axe from chaetomium thermophilum. furthermore, such enzymatic release of acetyl groups by axe not only enhanced the solubilization of xylan to some extent and, but also increased the subsequent hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulases  <cit> .

in general, cellulases and hemicellulases are modular enzymes in which the catalytic domain is appended to one or more noncatalytic carbohydrate binding modules   <cit> . cbms have the ability to enhance the hydrolysis of insoluble carbohydrate by concentrating the parental enzyme at their target polysaccharide  <cit> . the carbohydrate active enzyme  database  currently lists  <dig> cbm families classified based on amino acid similarity  <cit> . binding specificity can vary both between and within families  <cit> , for example, cbm <dig> binds specifically to cellulose  <cit> , whereas cbm 4- <dig>   <dig> and 22- <dig> bind specifically to xylan .

the bacterial cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes contain various cbms with diverse polysaccharide recognition specificity, paralleling the considerable diversity in the target substrate of the catalytic module of the enzymes. thus, the catalytic domains from cellulases  <cit> , xylanases  <cit>  and mannanases  <cit>  are generally appended to cellulose, xylan and mannan-binding cbms, respectively. therefore, different types of cbms can assist the appended catalytic domain targeting to a particular substrate and potentiate the catalytic rates of enzymes . in contrast, the catalytic domains in fungal cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes are strictly appended to cbm <dig>  that is, numerous enzymes that do not cleave cellulose contain cbm <dig> that recognize the celluolose  <cit> . cbm <dig> can potentiate enzyme activity of the catalytic module against hemicellulose due to its proximity effects, because in intact plant cell wall, hemicelluloses are in close association with cellulose  <cit> .

however, this potentiation by targeting and proximity effect of cbms might rely on the types of enzymes, and probably substrates as well  <cit> . for example, cbm <dig>  a xylan-binding module, can potentiate the activity of xyl11a from neocallimastix patricarium but not that of xyl10b from cellvibrio mixtus  <cit> . the enhancements of enzyme activity by additional cbm were extensively studied in recent years, but most of them were related to the main-chain degrading enzymes such as cellulases and xylanases . it is still unclear whether xylan-specific cbms are more effective than cbm <dig> in potentiating the activity of deacetylating enzymes by targeting and proximity effects when against substrates with different structures and cellulose contents. with this end, an acetyl xylan esterase  from volvariella volvacea, which consisted of a family  <dig> catalytic domain and a cbm <dig> linked with serine and threonine-rich peptide, was investigated in this study  <cit> . three cbms from family  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, which display different specificity for xylans, were selected to replace cbm <dig> in axe <dig>  the influences of cbms replacement on its enzyme activity and its synergistic hydrolysis of different substrates with xylanase were comparatively studied. the replacement of cbm <dig> in axe <dig> with xylan-specific binding modules resulted in a better catalysis performance than wild-type enzyme did, which provided a rational method to design better axes via engineered fusion to cbms with different binding specificities.

RESULTS
recombinant enzymes
to evaluate the influences of cbms replacement on enzyme activity and its synergistic hydrolysis for different substrates with xylanase, five recombinant axe1s with and without cbms were designed, that is, axe <dig>  a wild-type enzyme; axe1dc, a cbm1-deleted form but containing the linker; and axe1dc-cbm4-2/6/22- <dig>  a fusion of axe1dc and cbm4-2/6/22- <dig>  respectively. schematic representations of five raxe1s were shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> schematic structures of five recombinant acetyl xylan esterases with and without cbms. cd catalytic domain; linker, linker peptide, cbm1/4-2/6/22- <dig> family 1/4-2/6/22- <dig> carbohydrate-binding modules




purification and molecular weight analysis
the recombinant proteins were purified in a one-step procedure by affinity chromatography using ni-nta agarose gel. the theoretical molecular weights for purified raxe1s were estimated to be  <dig>  kda ,  <dig>  kda ,  <dig>  kda ,  <dig>  kda  and  <dig>  kda , respectively. however, sds-page analysis revealed that the purified enzymes migrated as two bands. the two forms were attributed to different degrees of glycosylation at the two n-glycosylation sites present in the protein. after endoglycosidase h  treatment, the proteins became a single band except axe1dc-cbm4- <dig>  but the molecular masses of raxe1s were still slightly higher than the estimated ones . the incomplete deglycosylation of raxe1s may be due to o-glycosylation sites located on raxe1s, which were found by o-β-glcnac attachment sites during the eukaryotic protein sequence determination using the yinoyang  <dig>  tool .fig.  <dig> sds-page of purified raxe1s and endo h-treated raxe1s. the gel was stained with coomassie brilliant blue and the samples were loaded in the following order : m, protein markers, lane 1– <dig>  purified axe1dc, axe <dig>  axe1dc-cbm <dig>  axe1dc-cbm4- <dig>  axe1dc-cbm22-2; lane 6– <dig>  endoglycosidase-h-treated raxe1s, and the bright bands near 26 kda were endo h




specific activity and biochemical properties of raxe1s towards soluble substrate
the biochemical properties of raxe1s were compared by using 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate as the substrate. temperature optima for all raxe1s were 50 °c and ph optima for raxe1s were ph  <dig>  except axe1dc-cbm <dig>  which was ph  <dig>  . axedc-cbm4- <dig> retained almost 40 % of activity after incubation at 55 °c for 90 min, in contrast, axe <dig> retained only 3 %, indicating that replacement of cbm <dig> with cbm4- <dig> resulted in more than 7-fold increase of the thermostability compared to wild-type enzyme. axe1dc-cbm22- <dig> also showed slightly higher thermostabilty than axe <dig> . no significant differences were found in the ph stability of these enzymes. all of the enzymes had a broad range of ph tolerance .fig.  <dig> biochemical properties of raxe1s. a optimum temperature; b optimum ph; c thermostability; d ph stability




thermostability improvement by fusion with cbm4- <dig> and cbm22- <dig> might benefit from their thermophilic properties. cbm4- <dig> from the thermophilic bacterium rhodothermus marinus xyn10a had an estimated denaturation temperature of  <dig>  °c, indicating it is a thermostable cbm  <cit> . cbm22- <dig> from clostridium thermocellum xyn10b had previously been described as a thermostabilizing domain on account of their apparent ability to confer thermostability to the catalytic module  <cit> . thermostability improvement by fusion with thermostable cbm was previously reported for some cellulases and hemicellulases. for example, the chimeric enzyme comprising feruloyl esterase and cbm <dig> retained 40 % of its activity after incubation at 55 °c for 30 min, whereas, the native enzyme almost lost its activity  <cit> . voutilainen et al.  <cit>  reported that the adding of cbm <dig>  cbm <dig> or cbm <dig> to the single-module cellobiohydrolase  from a thermophilic fungus talaromyces emersonii increased the unfolding temperatures from  <dig> to 74 °c,  <dig> and 75 °c, respectively. thermostable enzymes offer potential benefits in the hydrolysis of substrates, leading to improvement of the overall economy of the process  <cit> .

furthermore, fusion of cbm4- <dig> significantly enhanced the specific activity, the activity of axe1dc-cbm4- <dig> towards 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate, was twice as high as axe <dig>  kinetic parameters analysis also showed that the v
max and k

m value of axe1dc-cbm4- <dig> was nearly two-fold higher compared to axe <dig> . but no significant difference of the specific activity was observed between axe <dig> and other mutant enzymes . it might be due to the intrinsic property of cbm4- <dig> or/and a favorable structural arrangement between the binding module and the catalytic domain  <cit> .table  <dig> specific activities and kinetic parameters of raxe1s towards 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate

binding specificity of raxe1s
the ligand-binding properties of cbm <dig>  4- <dig>   <dig> and 22- <dig> had been characterized previously. cbm <dig> bound specifically to cellulose surfaces but not to mannan and xylan  <cit> . cbm4- <dig> showed high affinity for different soluble xylan, including birch xylan, wheat arabinoxylan, oat-spelt xylan and larchwood xylan, and phosphoric-acid swollen cellulose, but to avicel very slightly  <cit> . cbm <dig> had five sugar-binding sites and could accommodate highly decorated xylans but interacted weakly with soluble forms of cellulose  <cit> . cbm22- <dig> had a cleft harboring a binding site for xylan. this protein could bind specifically to xylooligosaccharides and various substituted xylans, especially oat spelt xylan, wheat and rye arabinoxylan  <cit> .

however, these substrates were restricted to purified polysaccharides that had an invariant chemical structure of β- <dig> -linked xylose moieties. here, three more complex substrates, including destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw and water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan , together with avicel, were used in binding experiments to examine the specificity of cbms. table  <dig> gave the composition of three lignocellulose substrates.table  <dig> the moncomponent contents of different substrates

compared with earlier studies with pure xylans, axe1dc-cbm4- <dig>  axe1dc-cbm <dig> and axe1dc-cbm22- <dig> displayed a less capability to bind to substrates. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the proteins were mainly left in unbound fraction when raxe1s were incubated with substrates at 0 °c for 1 h, except axe <dig>  which bound effectively to avicel . axe1dc was totally unable to bind to avicel and other substrates. axe1dc-cbm <dig> and axe1dc-cbm22- <dig> bound slightly more to lignocellulose substrates than avicel. avicel is not pure cellulose but contains also xylan, which explained the binding of xylan-specific cbm variants with avicel. however, axe1dc-cbm4- <dig> could just bind to these four insoluble substrates very slightly. axe <dig> also bound weakly to destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw and inax, probably due to simultaneous existence of cellulose in these substrates .fig.  <dig> binding specificities of raxe1s to a avicel, b destarched wheat bran, c naclo2-treated wheat straw and d water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan . lanes: m, protein markers; lanes:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  unbound fractions in supernatant, and lanes:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  fractions bound to substrates for axe1dc, axe <dig>  axe1dc-cbm <dig>  axe1dc-cbm4- <dig>  and axe1dc-cbm22- <dig>  respectively




influence of different cbms on the release of acetic acid from arabinoxylans
during the first hour, the release of acetic acid was very poor , but as time increased, it raised dramatically . after a hydrolysis for 24 h, the cumulative release of acetic acid from inax was the highest , followed by destarched wheat bran  and naclo2-treated wheat straw , although naclo2-treated wheat straw was richest in acetyl groups . thus might be due to the low accessibility of acetyl groups in naclo2-treated wheat straw. overall, the release of acetic acid by raxe1s in present study was much higher than that of axe from t. reesei against hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw  <cit> . to some extent, the differences of pretreatment method of substrates and enzymes origins might cause the distinction of enzymatic hydrolysis yield.fig.  <dig> time course for the enzymatic release of acetic acid from a destarched wheat bran, b naclo2-treated wheat straw and c water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan 



inax water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan




as expected, all raxe1s with cbm displayed a higher capability in release of acetic acid from destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw and inax than axe1dc, indicating the potentiation effect of cbm on raxe1s activity. furthermore, compared to axe <dig>  the replacement of cbm <dig> with cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig>  which bind to a broad range of xylans, resulted in  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  %, and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % more increases in release of acetyl groups from destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw and inax, respectively. axe1dc-cbm4- <dig> displayed similar capacity in release of acetic acid as axe <dig> . cbms can potentiate the appended carbohydrate-active enzyme action on lignocellulosic substrates via targeting and proximity effects depended on the sources of lignocellulosic substrates  <cit> . mai-gisondi et al.  <cit>  investigated the ability of a family  <dig> cellulose-binding module  fusion to enhance the activity of an acetylxylan esterase from aspergillus nidulans . it was found that the cbm <dig> fusion did not affect anaxe catalytic efficiency on soluble substrates such as p-nitrophenyl acetate and 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate, or corncob xylan, but increased the activity by two to four times on cellulose acetate. the elevated deacetylating capacity of axe <dig> was mainly attributed to the proximity effect of cbm <dig> because of its cellulose-specific binding property. thus, cbm <dig> increased the concentration of axe <dig> in the vicinity of the target substrate. on the other hand, the hydrolysis with axe1dc-cbm4- <dig>  axe1dc-cbm <dig> and axe1dc-cbm22- <dig> might be affected by targeting effect via assisting the enzyme attached directly to xylan. these results indicated the significance of targeting effect in axe <dig> acetic acid release by xylan-specific cbms, especially with cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> 

influence of different cbms on the synergistic actions between raxe1s and xynii
it could be seen that the combination of raxe1s and xynii was more effective in each case than xynii alone , implying the synergistic actions between raxe1s and xynii against destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw and water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan   <cit> . overall, the release of total reducing sugar from inax was the highest, followed by that of destarched wheat bran and naclo2-treated wheat straw.fig.  <dig> time course for the release of reducing sugar from a destarched wheat bran, b naclo2-treated wheat straw and c water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan 




in general, the combination of raxe1s with cbms and xynii displayed a more obvious synergy in comparison to the combination of axe1dc and xynii, implying the positive effect of cbms on synergistic actions between raxe1s and xynii against substrates. moreover, axe1dc-cbm <dig> and axe1dc-cbm22- <dig> had a more positive impact on the synergistic actions than axe <dig>  the combination of axe1dc-cbm <dig> and xynii was the highest, enhancing xylan hydrolysis by  <dig>   <dig>  34 % than xynii alone, which were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  % more increases compared to the combination of axe <dig> and xynii in the hydrolysis of destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw and inax for 24 h, respectively. the corresponding values for axe1dc-cbm22- <dig> were  <dig>   <dig>  30 % more than xynii alone, and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  % more increases compared to axe <dig>  however, there was no obvious distinction between axe1dc-cbm4- <dig> and axe <dig>  the different binding specificities of cbms belonging to different families might contribute to their difference in synergistic actions towards same substrates via targeting or proximity effects  <cit> . since the xylan-specific cbms, especially for cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig>  can target enzymes directly on the particular substrate xylan and potentiate the catalytic rates of axe1dc-cbm <dig> and axe1dc-cbm22- <dig>  therefore increasing the efficiency of synergistic hydrolysis in comparison to axe <dig> and axe1dc.

the released acetic acid was also quantified in the synergism experiments. with the same raxe1s enzyme loading, the adding of xynii improved the release of acetic acid as a whole . as for destarched wheat bran and inax, the releases of acetic acid were increased by about 15–17 % in each interval in synergism experiments than raxe <dig> alone. however, a distinction of acetic acid release pattern existed between naclo2-treated wheat straw with destarched wheat bran and inax. the adding of xynii dramatically accelerated the release rate of acetic acid particularly in the first 12 h when naclo2-treated wheat straw was used. specially, the simultaneous action of xynii and axe1dc-cbm4- <dig> increased the release of acetic acid by  <dig> and 38 % as compared to axe1dc-cbm4- <dig> alone at the first and sixth hour. for synergism of xynii and axe1dc-cbm <dig> or axe1dc-cbm22- <dig>  the corresponding values were  <dig>   <dig> and 100 %, 61 %, respectively. however, after 24 h, the improvement was not distinct between axe1dc-cbm4- <dig> or axe1dc-cbm22- <dig> alone with corresponding synergism with xynii. perhaps, xylan-specific cbm4- <dig> and cbm22- <dig> targeted to the xylan in earlier stages when xylan in naclo2-treated wheat straw was available, leading to accelerate the release of acetic acid during the first 12 h . but the targeting effect faded with the removal of xylan during the last 12 h  <cit> .fig.  <dig> release of acetic acid from destarched wheat bran , naclo2-treated wheat straw  and water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan  by simultaneous hydrolysis with xynii  and a axe1dc , b axe <dig> , c axe1dc-cbm4- <dig> , d axe1dc-cbm <dig>  and e axe1dc-cbm22- <dig> , respectively




the hydrolysis products of synergistic actions between raxe1s and xynii were determined by hpaec-pad. the main products were x <dig> and x <dig> with tiny of x <dig>  x <dig> was much higher than x <dig>  whereas no x <dig> or above was detected. as shown in table  <dig>  raxe1s with cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> caused the highest increases in the total amount of x <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig> than other raxe1s when simultaneous hydrolysis with xynii. this result was consistent well with the reducing sugar determined by somogyi method . it is interesting to note the ratios of x <dig> and x <dig> released from different substrates are different. although the hemicellulose fraction of these three lignocellulose substrates is arabinoxylan, the structure and composition of arabinoxylan are still different, which may cause the different enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and then the ratios of x <dig> and x <dig> from different substrates.table  <dig> the hydrolysis products of different substrates after 24 h hydrolysis by raxe1s and xynii

a high linear correlation exists between the release of acetic acid and reducing sugar . the r
 <dig> of destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw and inax was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. this suggested that the removal of acetyl groups contributed to the release of xylose from xylans. for the synergistic actions between raxe1s and xynii, the highest enhancement was obtained in inax due to the highest release of acetic acid as compared with destarched wheat bran and naclo2-treated wheat straw. this suggested that the synergy was more pronounced in the materials containing a high accessibility of acetyl groups. these results were in good agreement with reports on the combination of endoxylanase and axe in increasing the xylan conversion, and consequently the cellulose conversion to glucose by cellulolytic enzymes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> linear relationships between release of acetic acid and reducing sugar from destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw and water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan  after 24 h hydrolysis by combined raxe1s and xynii




CONCLUSIONS
cellulose-specific cbm <dig> in axe <dig> obviously contributes to its catalytic action against lignocellulosic substrates compared with axe1dc. however, the replacement of cbm <dig> with xylan-specific cbm4- <dig> significantly enhanced axe <dig> thermostability and catalytic activity against soluble substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate. whereas replacement with xylan-specific cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> were more effective in enzymatic release of acetic acid from destarched wheat bran, naclo2-treated wheat straw, and water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan compared to axe <dig>  moreover, replacement with cbm <dig> and cbm22- <dig> also resulted in higher degree releases of xylose and acetic acid from different lignocellulosic substrates when simultaneous hydrolysis with xylanase. a good linear relationship exists between acetic acid and the reducing sugar release. our findings suggested the significance of targeting effect in axe <dig> catalysis against lignocellulosic substrates mediated by xylan-specific cbms.
