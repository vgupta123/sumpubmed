BACKGROUND
a key aim in the study of evolutionary genetics is to identify loci that facilitate adaptation. the importance of de novo mutations and standing genetic variation to the mode and tempo of the adaptive process has been debated, as well as the importance of fixation for adaptation . through necessity, de novo mutations are essential within bacterial systems, where beneficial mutations arising within clonal populations will sweep to fixation. interaction and competition between de novo mutations observed in experimental populations have provided valuable insights into the process of adaptation within microbial species . research in sexual organisms, however, reveals that selection on standing genetic variation is the predominant basis of adaptation in higher eukaryotes . in this case, standing genetic variants are present in the population at low frequencies, maintained by neutral or slightly negative selection. within an altered environment, these standing variants will gain a selective advantage and increase in frequency in the population to reach fixation. depending on the genetic architecture of functional traits and population structure, adaptation can also be facilitated by moderate allele frequency differences at multiple genes, without producing such dramatic sweep-to-fixation signatures  <cit> .

the number of genes underlying an adaptive process often belies the complexity of the selective environment. for traits with a complex genetic basis, such as aging and courtship, experimental evolution studies in drosophila have demonstrated genome-wide involvement in response to selection  <cit> . for immune traits, the extent of genome involvement in the adaptive response can vary. for example, in drosophila melanogaster, nearly 5% of the genome, and  <dig> genes, were suggested to be involved in an 150% increase in parasitoid resistance  <cit> , whereas only a few genes were identified and functionally validated as the targets of selection for resistance to drosophila c virus  <cit> .

here we use a genomic approach to investigate the consequences of long-term, bidirectional selection on a single immune trait from a base population of randombred white leghorn chickens  <cit> . in brief, selection was performed for high  or low  day  <dig> antibody production to an intravenous challenge of sheep red blood cells  . at generation  <dig>  the has and las lines showed an average  <dig>  fold difference in antibody titers . pooled genome sequencing was carried out for each selected line at generation  <dig>  allowing the identification of regions of high differentiation . due to the bidirectional selection regime, the identified selection signatures would result primarily from selection on standing genetic variants  <cit> . relaxed lines  founded for both lines at generation  <dig> were also genome sequenced in pools at generation  <dig> . the genetic effects of the sweeps were estimated using data from an f <dig> intercross between the has and las lines at generation  <dig> fig.  <dig> changes in mean sheep red blood cell  antibody  titers across  <dig> generations of selection in virginia ab chicken lines for females  and males . selected lines shown in blue, with relaxed lines shown in yellow





we observed over  <dig> regions across the genome affected by the selection regime, characterized by spans of extreme differentiation between has <dig> and las <dig>  these would include true selective sweeps and those regions displaying this pattern due to the random genetic drift experienced by the small selected populations. to identify strong candidate sweeps from this large set of differentiated regions, we overlapped regions with associations detected to antibody response in an f <dig> intercross between the selected lines, used enrichment analysis to detect regions with immune genes and identified overlaps with immune associations mapped in other studies/populations. in this way, a high-confidence set of candidate selective sweep regions may be inferred. three particularly relevant candidate genes, mhc, sema5a and tgfbr <dig>  are presented in more detail.

estimating the contribution of drift to the allelic divergence between populations
simulations in sfs_code  <cit>  were used to estimate the contribution of genetic drift to the genome-wide divergence between the has and las lines, an effect that would confound true sweep signatures across these genomes. simulations were conducted for macro- and micro-chromosome recombination rates  and regions of differentiation due to neutral processes are summarized in table  <dig>  median lengths were  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively, with maximum lengths at  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp. from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the simulated dna fragments showed stretches of differentiation, emphasising the influence of genetic drift in the selected chicken populations. quantifying the regions that have differentiated as a result of selection versus drift is impossible, but by overlapping the genomic results with those of other studies, association analysis and investigating deeper into candidate genes, we build confidence that many regions have contributed to the divergence in antibody response observed in the antibody lines.table  <dig> summary information from simulations

many candidate selective sweep regions contain genes related with immune-function
the  <dig> highly differentiated regions contained a total  <dig> annotated genes. to identify potential candidate adaptive genes, as well as to indicate individual candidate sweeps that are more likely to have reached high frequency by selection rather than drift, we subjected these to a gene ontology  analysis. using the david go analysis,  <dig> gene ids were reported to be associated with immune system processes , and these mapped to  <dig> regions . the panther go analysis identified  <dig> gene ids associated with immune function  mapping to  <dig> regions . combining the results from both methods revealed a total of  <dig> regions overlapping genes associated with immune function. between  <dig> and  <dig> immune genes were found within these regions, with the most observed on gga  <dig>  notably the major histocompatibility complex  region.

several candidate selective-sweep regions overlap with genomic regions associated with immunological traits in chicken
in total,  <dig> highly differentiated regions overlapped with regions previously reported to be associated with immunological traits in chickens. these included antibody response to srbc and brucella abortus in leghorn hens  <cit> , primary and secondary antibody response to srbc in isa warren layer hens  <cit> , innate immunity in layer hens  <cit> , innate and adaptive immunity in layer hens  <cit> , multiple immune traits in the chinese indigenous breed bejing-you chicken  <cit> , and differential expression between high and low srbc antibody responses in white leghorn females  <cit>  .

several candidate selective-sweep regions are associated with day  <dig> antibody titers in an f <dig> intercross between chickens from has <dig> and las32
we reanalyzed a previously generated dataset from an f <dig> intercross from generation  <dig> of the divergent lines. in total,  <dig> of the  <dig> polymorphic markers were highly differentiated, with an allele-frequency difference between has <dig> and las32 >  <dig>  . this snp subset was clustered into  <dig> regions on  <dig> chromosomes from which a subset of  <dig> representative snp markers  was selected using a per region backward elimination analysis. these markers were then fitted jointly in a whole-genome multi-locus, backward elimination analysis to identify five snp markers associated with the selected trait at 20% fdr threshold. four of these markers were retained in the model at a 5% fdr threshold . the identified markers were located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .table  <dig> genetic effects of snp markers associated with log <dig> at a 20% fdr threshold in the f <dig> intercross of virginia antibody lines

as the linkage disequilibrium is extensive in the f <dig> population, the functional polymorphisms causing the marker-trait associations could located several mb away from the tested markers. the marker with the most significant association, rs <dig>  is located close to a candidate sweep region at gga2:  <dig> ,000– <dig> , <dig>  which contains the candidate immune gene, semaphorin 5a sema5a . among the markers selected by the 5% fdr threshold, rs <dig> is located on gga <dig> between a sweep region ending at  <dig> , <dig> and another beginning at  <dig> , <dig>  marker rs <dig> is located just outside the sweep region at gga1:  <dig> ,500– <dig> , <dig>  and marker rs <dig> falls within the sweep region on gga2:  <dig> ,000– <dig> , <dig>  none of which contains annotated immune genes. the marker rs <dig> showed only 20% fdr significance in the model, but is located within the sweep region gga16: 2000– <dig>  and notably within the candidate mhc region .

sema5a is a candidate adaptive gene in a selective sweep region associated with day  <dig> antibody titers
the snp marker rs <dig> that is significantly associated with day  <dig> antibody titers is located only 568 kb away from, and closely linked to in the f <dig> population, the candidate sweep region gga2:  <dig> ,000– <dig> , <dig> . it is fixed for t in has <dig>  while it segregates for t/g in las at differentiated frequencies . we explored the haplotype-structure of this candidate sweep region in the four analyzed populations in greater detail where the sweep region overlaps with the sema5a candidate gene . in this region,  <dig> positions are fixed in has <dig>  but continue to segregate in las <dig> . these positions in las <dig> contribute towards two major haplotypes, haplo <dig> and haplo <dig>  which are not present in has <dig>  and segregate at the approximate haplotype frequencies of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . when compared to the relaxed lines, both har <dig> and lar <dig> have haplo <dig> and haplo <dig> segregating at intermediate frequencies, and lack the haplo <dig> haplotype . table  <dig> estimates of mean phenotypes for the three genotypes at the significantly associated snp near sema5a  in the f <dig> intercross between has <dig> and las32


fig.  <dig> inferred major sema5a haplotypes in has <dig> , has <dig> , las <dig> , lar <dig> . positions are colored based on their contribution to different haplotypes: allele frequencies for snps in green contribute to haplo <dig> and orange contribute to haplo <dig>  snps in blue contribute to both haplo <dig> and haplo <dig>  so where both of these haplotypes are present, blue positions will have an allele frequency approximately equal to  <dig> as in las <dig> where only one haplotype is present. in the case of lar <dig> and har <dig>  the blue positions will have an allele frequency approximate to haplo2





the associated snp marker rs <dig> appears to tag these major haplotypes at this candidate sweep region in the f <dig> population, with the g-allele tagging haplo <dig>  the dominant haplotype in las <dig>  and the t-allele tagging both haplo <dig> and haplo <dig> . from these inferred haplotype frequencies, it appears that haplo <dig> has a selective benefit only in las and otherwise would be deleterious, thus explaining why it was purged in the lar line after the relaxation of selection. pairwise differentiation of this region reinforces this hypothesis, as las <dig> is highly differentiated from has <dig>  har <dig>  and lar <dig>  while lar <dig> appears less differentiated from has <dig> and har <dig> than las <dig> . the two differentiated variants within sema5a exons are synonymous, with the majority of polymorphisms in this region located in intergenic and intronic regions.table  <dig> pairwise differentiation  between the analyzed lineages across the region overlapping the sema5a gene and the candidate selective sweep 




deletion in tgfbr <dig> located in the longest candidate sweep region
previously, we observed a correlation between the length of selective sweeps and their contribution to adaptation in a similar long-term, single-trait selection-experiment for 8-week body weight in chickens  <cit> . therefore, here we investigated the longest candidate sweep region  in more detail. in this region, has <dig> and las <dig> appear fixed for alternative haplotypes across this region, as are their respective relaxed lines. this pattern of fixation indicates that this region was fixed for alternative alleles within the selected lines prior to generation  <dig>  which was the founding generation of the relaxed lines. such rapid fixation suggests that this sweep represents selection on a standing variant with strong phenotypic effect. several genes with roles in the immune system are located within this region, including several cytokines, and we also detected a large structural variant within the transforming growth factor beta-receptor  <dig> gene, tgfbr <dig> .

by referring to rnaseq data, we identified  <dig> exons contributing to the transcription of tgfbr <dig> . exons 2- <dig> and 4- <dig> of tgfbr <dig> appear to be the result from a historical duplication event. exons  <dig> and  <dig> are identical at the sequence level, while exons  <dig> and  <dig> share over 90% sequence identity . the haplotype that appears fixed in las <dig> has a large deletion overlapping exons 4- <dig> of this duplicated region. by comparing de novo assemblies of las <dig> and has <dig> genomes, the deletion was localized to gga2:  <dig> ,509– <dig> , <dig> and results in a 3712 bp deletion .

discussion
long-term, bidirectional experimental selection provides a powerful approach to gain empirical insights to the genetics of complex traits. within the quantitative genetic framework, research has provided knowledge about relationships between the predicted and realized responses to selection, the boundaries of selection in closed populations due to reduction in selectable genetic variation, and physiological limits for further response  <cit> . with the advent of large-scale molecular genetics and genomics methods, these highly selected populations also become valuable models for studying how the genomes of populations under intense selection for various traits evolve during adaptation  <cit> .

the virginia antibody lines are a unique experimental model-population for studying the genetics of long-term selection for an adaptive immune trait in a higher vertebrate. using whole-genome re-sequencing of pooled dna from these divergent lines, we observed wide genome involvement in the long-term response to selection. over  <dig> regions, covering nearly 20% of the genome, were clearly differentiated between the lines. despite the action of genetic drift, many regions were the result of bidirectional selection and have contributed to selection response, as suggested by overlaps with immune genes and marker to immune-trait associations in an intercross between the selected lines as well as other independent populations. these candidate selective sweeps are primarily the result of two key factors: first, the selected variants were present at the onset of selection , and second, that selection acts on these standing variants in opposite directions.

these extensive genome changes in this long-term selection experiment suggest that srbc antibody response is a highly polygenic trait. the  <dig>  fold difference in antibody titers between the divergently selected lines has been facilitated by large differentiation at many loci with standing genetic variants. this finding is consistent with those in the virginia body weight lines, which has been bidirectionally selected for juvenile body-weight for over  <dig> generations. there, it has been shown that selection on standing variation in a highly polygenic genetic architecture was the main contributor to the long-term selection response in body weight  <cit> .

genetic drift in these relatively small breeding populations would have contributed not only to random divergence between the selected lines, but also to the fixation of selective sweeps. previous studies where drosophila melanogaster and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used to model adaptation in vertebrate populations have rarely detected complete selective sweeps  <cit> . further, in human studies, the polygenic architecture of most traits disperses the influence of selection and hence adaptation is facilitated by moderate allele frequency changes of multiple loci without dramatic fixation events  <cit> . in contrast, within our small population, there was loss of heterozygosity within selective sweep regions attributable to fixation of genetic variants. the combination of selection and genetic drift within the antibody lines have lead to a higher level of fixation of selective sweeps than observed in other model systems.

antibody production is a major defense mechanism of the humoral immune response. it involves a variety of different cell types with specific functions, including immunological cascades involving the recognition of the foreign cells by t and b immune cells, activation and differentiation of b cells into plasma cells and secretion of specific antibodies  <cit> . moreover, this cascade relies on the careful coordination of gene expression through signaling molecules and appropriate receptors, within which there is potential for many genes and genetic variants to have an effect. our results suggest that not just that many loci play a role in srbc antibody production, but also that the founder population harbored substantial genetic variation upon which selection could act. this supports the expectation that adaptive immune traits are genetically complex and further emphasizes the need to consider more than just a few key immune genes when studying immunogenetic selection and adaptation even in populations originating from a narrow genetic basis.

earlier works with the virginia antibody lines have, however, shown that the level of antibody-response does not have a direct connection to a general greater immunological efficacy. for example, when the lines selected for high  and low  antibody production were faced with different immunological challenges, the has were less susceptible to the northern fowl mite  and newcastle disease, but more susceptible to the bacterial pathogens escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus when compared to las  <cit> . these immunological trade-offs further emphasize the complexity of the immune system, and show fixation of mutations within this selected population that would be otherwise deleterious. selection for different arms of the immune system resulting in difference in disease resistances have been well characterized in other chicken studies, such as the iah compton lines, where different inbred lines show variation in disease susceptibility/ resistance  <cit> , as well as the notable differences in disease resistances observed between broiler and layer chicken breeds  <cit> . they also serve as a reminder that this study does not provide insights to how and whether breeding can be used to improve the general performance of the immune system, but rather that the immune system of a particular population is likely to be very adaptable when challenged with various disease challenges and that such responses are likely due to selection on available variants in many genes. it is no doubt advantageous for a population to have such variation in host-pathogen interactions to respond to immunological challenges.

we observed many genes with immunological function underlying our candidate sweep regions, while many still did not. particularly from our association analysis, we found two snp markers with associations to day  <dig> antibody titers and closely located candidate immune genes, while the remaining three snp markers were not located near immune genes involved in selective sweeps. this may be a consequence of our strict go search for genes with immune function, which would not identify functional genes contributing to the divergent antibody response but without go immune function terms. alternatively, genes within the chicken genome lacking annotation in galgal <dig> would not be identified by our methodology. it should be noted that while our analysis of this previously published dataset focused on the most informative snp markers , this restricted our genome coverage and would have limited the opportunities of identifying associations to day  <dig> antibody titers.

in the remaining sections, we discuss a number of particularly promising candidate functional genes detected in the identified sweep regions.

semaphorin-5a
a sweep region located near the snp marker  with the strongest association to day  <dig> antibody titers in the f <dig> intercross between the has and las lines in generation  <dig> overlaps the first  <dig> of  <dig> exons  of semaphorin-5a . semaphorins are a large family of secreted and membrane bound proteins, originally discovered in the nervous system with a role in axon guidance . sema5a is a secreted semaphorin involved in immune regulation and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases  <cit> . it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of immunological diseases such as mastitis in dairy cattle  <cit> , chronic immune thrombocotypenia in humans  <cit> , and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism in humans  <cit> . as an immunoregulator, sema5a influences the expression of cytokines such as ifn-gamma, tnf-gamma, and interleukins  <cit> .

in the virginia antibody lines, the sweep region overlapping the sema5a gene is present in at least three different haplotypes: the major haplotypes referred to here as haplo <dig>  haplo <dig>  and haplo <dig>  haplo <dig> is present only in las <dig>  suggesting that this variant involved in low antibody production was purged in relaxed line lar <dig>  this is reflected in the population differentiation between the lines as well, as las <dig> is most differentiated of the lines. the extent of differentiation at many markers suggests that these haplotypes were present as standing variants in the base population, as opposed to novel variants emerging in the las lineage after generation  <dig> and the founding of the relaxed line. although we have no information for earlier generations, we can speculate on the driving forces acting on haplo <dig>  given the complete purging of this haplotype from the relaxed lines, it seems reasonable to assume that this haplotype has a fitness cost; a fitness cost that may not have been evident in the base population or present as a cryptic variant. in the context of the las line, selection for haplo <dig> progressed slowly , for which this inferred fitness cost is a possible explanation. as haplo <dig> is expected to segregate at an intermediate frequency at generation  <dig>  this fitness cost would purge haplo <dig> quickly from the lar line once selection is relaxed.

we observed only three synonymous snp sites in the coding region of sema5a, with the majority of sequence polymorphism between haplotypes contained in intergenic and intronic regions. taken together, this implies that the involvement of sema5a to the differential antibody response in the virginia antibody lines would be due to regulatory polymorphisms where the two haplotypes produce different expression levels of the sema5a protein, from different promoter or enhancer sequences. this could impact the expression of cytokines within this regulatory network and thus influence an effective and specific immune response.

transforming growth factor beta receptor 2
earlier work with the virginia body-weight selected lines, which have undergone a similar long-term experimental selection regime, has shown that the length of a selective-sweep is correlated with its contribution to the adaptive phenotype  <cit> . hence, the individual sweep in our study that is most likely to make a significant contribution to antibody response is the long  <dig>  mb sweep region identified on gga <dig>  in this region, only one gene had go immune terms, the transforming growth factor beta receptor  <dig> , making it a logical candidate gene for further study. tgfbr <dig> is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family, encoding a transmembrane protein that binds the secreted protein tgf-beta. the tgf signaling pathway regulates diverse biological processes during all stages of life and plays a key role in growth and the immune response  <cit> .

we observed fixation for different tgfbr <dig> haplotypes in the selected lines. in-depth analyses comparing the sequence data for has <dig> and las <dig> suggest that these haplotypes differ by a 3712 bp deletion  fixed in las <dig>  which encompasses exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the tgfbr <dig> gene prediction. fixation of these haplotypes in the respective relaxed lines implies that the selected lines were already fixed  by generation  <dig>  when the relaxed lines were founded. the length of this sweep, together with the rapid fixation, suggests that the selection acted strongly and fixation occurred swiftly, before multiple recombination events could break down the linkage within this region and leave a shorter sweep.

the strong selection signature suggests that the tgfbr <dig> haplotypes might have played a major role in determining antibody response, most likely due to its key function in the tgf-beta pathway. evidence is lacking, however, that this large sweep region was associated with 5 day antibody titers in the f <dig> intercross between has <dig> and las <dig>  despite being covered by  <dig> segregating snp markers . it should be noted, however, that these snp markers were fixed or near fixed for alternative alleles in generation  <dig>  as the population used for association analysis was small, the power in this analysis was low. therefore it difficult to make strong conclusions as to whether these haplotypes had no or only minor effects on antibody response, or whether their functional significance was reliant on the genetic background of the population.

defects in tgfbr <dig> can result in serious debilitating and fatal diseases in humans, most notably the autosomal dominant aortic aneurysm syndrome, loeys-dietz syndrome, as well as an increased risk of certain cancers  <cit> . that none of these conditions has been observed in las suggests that the deletion observed in las <dig> and lar <dig> did not completely disrupt the function of the gene or that the function of this gene is less important in chickens than in humans. it is relevant to point out that mortality in these populations is low under our husbandry conditions. the deletion of only one set of duplicated exons may indicate that the las haplotype may still result in a functional tgfbr <dig> protein, but with less splice variant options than the has haplotype.

major histocompatibility complex region
the major histocompatibility complex  is the most well studied immune gene complex in vertebrates due to its key role in the pathogen surveillance  <cit> . accordingly the mhc has previously been investigated in the virginia antibody lines, albeit not at a sequence level  <cit> . the chicken mhc region is relatively small, simple and tightly-linked, compared to that of mammals, and thus termed the minimal essential mhc  <cit> . bidirectional selection on the mhc was evident as early as generation  <dig> in the virginia antibody lines, and alternative haplotypes were fixed by generation  <dig> . fixation for b
 <dig> in has <dig> and b
 <dig> in las <dig> was confirmed in our pooled genome sequencing and this divergent fixation contributed to the sweep signal on gga <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp.

the sweep overlapping the mhc region spans a total 321 kb, and encompasses genes vital to antigen processing and presentation including mhc class i and ii, tap genes and tapasin. association analysis between mhc haplotype and antibody response has demonstrated that the b
 <dig> allele acts dominantly, with higher day  <dig> and day  <dig> titers of antibodies in homozygous and heterozygous b
 <dig> individuals  <cit> . this explains the rapid fixation for the recessive b
 <dig> in the las, as inferred by the fixation in lar <dig>  and why both haplotypes still segregate in har <dig>  although the has <dig> was close to fixation for b
 <dig>  at least one b
 <dig> haplotype must have persisted until generation  <dig> the origin of the relaxed lines, as it continues to segregate in har <dig>  the immunological advantage of the b
 <dig> allele is well known in the context of marek’s herpevirus  <cit> . studies have also demonstrated that the b
 <dig> haplotype has wider peptide recognition with more flexibility in the peptides it could bind, whereas b
 <dig> is limited to peptides between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids and negative anchor amino acids at certain sites .

CONCLUSIONS
adaptation to long-term, bidirectional selection for antibody response in this experimental chicken population has been facilitated by standing genetic variation across many regions of the genome. although selective-sweep studies by themselves were unable to quantify the contribution by individual genes and polymorphisms to adaptation, data from earlier association and functional studies highlight three particularly interesting candidate sweeps and underlying candidate genes involved in immune surveillance  and immune regulation . further work to investigate the large numbers of additional immune genes that are likely to have contributed to the response to selection in this experimental population would be useful to improve our understanding of selection on immune traits and to unravel the complexity of their interactions. these experimental lines continue to present a unique opportunity towards understanding the mode and tempo of selection in a higher vertebrate organism.
