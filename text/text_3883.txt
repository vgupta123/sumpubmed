BACKGROUND
the survival of plants in any given environment relies on the ability of the populations to develop appropriate responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. for this reason, complex coordinated systems of responses to these stresses have evolved in different plant species. understanding of these systems is one of the main goals of plant biology and this information can be crucial for breeding genes related to stress resistance in crop plants.

from this perspective, the species of the family cucurbitaceae are of special interest for a number of reasons. they form a group of plant species with genomes of intermediate size , they are mostly diploid, and they have not undergone large genome duplications apart from those which occurred with the original diversification of flowering plants. they also have a particular system of vascular development that has been related to defense mechanisms specific to these species. in addition, they are of significant economic interest and breeding of the cucurbit species is active within the seed industry.

most disease resistance genes in plants encode nucleotide-binding site leucine rich repeat  proteins, a populated family that can be encoded by hundreds of genes per genome  <cit> . one of the features of cucurbit genomes that has been revealed by sequencing three representative genomes is that the number of defense-related genes, particularly those belonging to the nbs-lrr protein family, appears to be significant lower when compared to other plant species . it has recently been proposed that the content of nbs-lrr genes in plant species is correlated with that of mirnas directed to them as a mechanism to control their levels of expression  <cit> . it has also been shown that these genes tend to be present in clusters, which appear to be hot spots of genomic variability due to the high level of presence/absence gene variation , detected when comparing genomes of related species or genome sequences within the species, which make these regions good candidates for comparative genomics and phylogeny analysis . in melon, half of the  <dig> predicted nbs-lrr genes group in nine clusters, with a region that spans 1 mb of linkage group v, containing the highest density of r-genes  and also the highest concentration of pav polymorphisms found in the melon genome . this region is also known to include the locus of the agronomically important vat gene that confers aphid resistance to some melon cultivars  <cit> .

while recent studies have produced genome-wide analysis of nbs-lrr genes in cucurbits, these efforts have been limited by the quality and completeness of the available sequences  <cit> . the presence of multiple duplicated genes in nbs-lrr clusters makes these regions challenging sequencing targets. indeed, it has been proposed that the available annotation of a high proportion of melon r-genes is likely wrong, due to a combination of sequence quality issues and automatic gene annotation  <cit> .

this article presents a detailed analysis of the structure of the largest nbs-lrr gene cluster found in melon, together with comparisons with the syntenic regions in cucumber and watermelon and also between different melon varieties. as a required preliminary step, however, a comprehensive refinement step was used to close unsequenced gaps and to correct sequencing errors in order to improve the available sequence and gene annotations.

RESULTS
sequence refinement of a 1 mb fragment of the melon genome
the aim of this research was to carry out a detailed analysis of the genomic variability of a cluster of gene sequences putatively involved in resistance to pathogens . found in melon linkage group  <dig>  they are known to be highly polymorphic at the intra- and interspecific levels  <cit> . however, the presence of multiple, highly similar genes in a relatively small region makes it difficult to obtain an accurate and complete sequence by high-throughput new-generation technologies. indeed, a cursory view of the reference genome sequence and the annotation of genes in this region shows multiple sequence gaps, many of which are in orfs causing partial annotations, fragments from the same gene annotated as independent genes, etc. also, by aligning re-sequencing reads to the reference genome, small indels and homopolymer errors on coding regions are visible.

a recent study on r-genes in cucurbits concluded that a large proportion of r-genes are pseudogenes caused by large deletions, frameshift indels, and nonsense mutations  <cit> . the same study reported that the annotations of nearly half the melon r-genes were likely wrong, often due to the forced annotation of extra introns to avoid premature stop codons or frameshift mutations. however, several of these putative melon pseudogenes could be just partially annotated due to sequence gaps or single nucleotide errors resulting in false stop codons. considerable refinement of the one-megabase fragment that contains the melon r-cluster was clearly necessary before further studies could be done on this region.

the sequence improvement was in two stages. first, re-sequencing by illumina paired-end reads was used to close gaps and correct false snps and small indels; secondly, a pcr experimental approach was used to close still unresolved gaps, particularly those affecting orfs.

about thirty million pairs of illumina reads have been previously obtained from dhl <dig>  the double haploid line source of the melon reference assembly  <cit> . it was our aim to evaluate how these reads could help to improve the reference sequence  by aligning them to the reference sequence in order to extract information regarding gaps and sequence errors. few publicly available software utilities address either gap closing or sequence correction using mapping alignments. the pagit toolkit does in fact deal with both aspects but, being designed primarily to be used with small size genomes such as that of bacteria, it is not directly applicable to larger genomes  <cit> . therefore, a specific method of applying pagit to our particular needs was devised. a detailed description of the procedure is given in the methods section and a schematic representation in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

it is important to note that, although the final goal was the refinement of ca. 1 mb sequence, it was deemed necessary to work with the complete reference genome and whole set of illumina reads. working only with those reads that map to the selected region would filter out reads that map to absent sequences  and, therefore, essential for closing gap purposes. but mapping the whole set of re-sequencing reads to only a small fraction of the genome normally results in a high number of misalignments, because reads that map to different but highly similar regions align to the same region when only one of those regions is available.

the metrics of the melon reference assembly  and the improved, post-pagit, version are compared in table  <dig>  while the number of scaffolds remained unchanged, many contigs  were shown to be redundant based on identity to sequences in other, larger, contigs or scaffolds, and they were removed from the final version. the processed assembly contains ca.  <dig>  mb of additional sequence, roughly equal to the number of uncertain nucleotides  removed from it. in all, only  <dig> % of the original amount of ns was deleted while ca.  <dig>  stretches of ns  were solved , which means that, as expected, mainly short gaps were closed. although the percentage reduction of n-stretches was not impressive, the number of estimated corrected errors was high . also, the number of illumina reads remaining unmapped after aligning reads against the reference genome was reduced by 25% in the refined sequence, a quality improvement indicator.table  <dig>

at this stage, the 1 mb genomic fragment comprising genes melo3c <dig> to melo3c <dig> was selected for further improvement. this region includes the cluster of nbs-lrr genes  together with other genes putatively involved in defence responses, and has been shown to be a hot-spot of genomic variability across several melon cultivars  <cit> . the procedure to close unresolved gaps and correct any remaining sequence errors detected is described in detail in the methods section and included the use of previously available bac sequence information  <cit> , pcr-aided gap closing, and manual correction of the final sequence by visually inspecting the mapping-alignments of the re-sequencing reads. the final, improved sequence comprising genes melo3c <dig> to melo3c <dig> is given in additional file 2: file s <dig> 

the metrics of the refined sequence as compared to cm <dig>  and the post-pagit versions are given in table  <dig>  the number of ns in the original 1 mb sequence was 18%, nearly twice the average value in the melon genome, which points to the complexity of this region as a sequencing target. this figure decreased to 17% in the post-pagit version but dropped to just 5% in the final sequence, due to the successful outcome of the pcr approach. the number of n-stretches was also significantly reduced . figure  <dig> gives a graphical view of mapped alignments against cm <dig>  and the refined sequence, with some examples of gap closing and snp correction.figure  <dig>

once the final 1 mb sequence was available, the cds of all nbs-lrr in that region were re-annotated as described in the methods section. table  <dig> summarizes how the changes affected gene annotation. only five sequences of a total of  <dig> genes remained unchanged. gap closing resulted in additional coding sequence for ten genes, while nucleotide corrections occurred in exons of four genes. as expected, most of these changes were related to homopolymer corrections. other important changes were that the previous genes melo3c <dig> and melo3c <dig> do in fact belong to the melo3c <dig> orf and melo3c <dig> orf, respectively, and melo3c <dig> probably represents a 5′ fragment of gene melo3c004302- <dig>  although no satisfactory orf could be found joining both fragments. apart from the  <dig> annotated nbs-lrr orfs, five previously predicted genes  were probably pseudogenes, due to their short lengths, and were not analyzed further. the protein sequences of the newly annotated genes can be found in additional file 3: file s <dig> table  <dig>

to assess sequence improvement, specifically that related to error correction, the number of genetic variants  found when mapping dhl <dig> re-sequencing reads to cm <dig>  and the improved region was calculated. re-sequencing reads and reference sequences belonged to the same cultivar  so the expected number of variants was low, all the more since dhl <dig> is a double haploid line. therefore, and as a contrasting control, the variant analysis was also performed using previously available re-sequencing data from the distant melon variety cultivar c- <dig>  a cucumis melo ssp. agrestis accession from cape verde  <cit> . these results are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

the number of changes  predicted when mapping dhl <dig> illumina reads against cm <dig>  was 1/kb, a figure reduced by half when mapping was against the improved sequence. as a reference, mapping of c- <dig> reads against cm <dig>  produced  <dig> changes/kb. interestingly, the number of changes in the 1 mb region using cm <dig>  as a reference was 4/kb, four times higher than the average genome value, which may be a result of the bad quality of this particular region compared to the average assembly quality. this figure dropped to  <dig>  changes/kb in the improved 1 mb region. significantly, the number of changes found in exons of nbs-lrr genes in the 1 mb regions dropped from  <dig> in cm <dig>   to only seven in the improved region. it is clear that, even without gap closing, the refined version is a much better source for gene prediction than the original one.

analysis of gene sequences in the nbs-lrr cluster and comparison with other cucurbits
the highly conserved nbs regions of the annotated r-genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. their sequences are given in additional file 4: file s <dig>  a phylogeny tree was built and drawn alongside a schematic representation of the genomic distribution of the nbs-lrr genes . based on proximity criteria, the cluster of r-genes can be subdivided into four regions where the one marked d in figure  <dig> corresponds to a cluster of coiled-coil nbs-lrr while a-c clusters contain tir-domain nbs-lrr proteins. there is good correlation between the topology of the phylogeny tree and the clustering and distribution of genes along the genome, indicating a pattern of local gene amplifications. the transcription direction of the genes was also consistent with this picture .figure  <dig> 
clusters of r-genes in the melo04258-melo3c <dig> region, phylogeny relationships, and synteny with cucumber and watermelon. melon genes, represented by vertical lines accompanied by gene ids, are grouped in four sub-clusters based on proximity: tir-nbs-lrr genes in clusters a , b , and c ; cc-nbs-lrr genes in cluster d . syntenic genes in cucumber and watermelon are in the same colour as their melon orthologues. colored lines connect pairs of genes in two different species showing the highest protein identity/blastp e-values; however, when the genes in a cluster are so similar as to unequivocally establish one-to-one orthology relationships, a colored line connects a gene to a cluster of genes instead. orfs with homology to nbs-lrr r-genes but too short as to be considered true genes are in grey. gene ids in red indicate putatively expressed genes . direction of transcription of all genes is left to right, but for the few genes marked with red arrows. for each species, phylogeny relationships based on the alignment of the conserved nbs regions are also shown. note that branch lengths have no phylogeny meaning due to the original trees having been distorted to project them on the actual disposition of genes on the genome.



in order to investigate further the generation of gene duplications within the cucurbitaceae family, the published genome sequences of two other cucurbits, cucumber and watermelon, were analyzed for the correspondent syntenic regions  <cit> . the sizes of the three sequenced cucurbit genomes were comparable but significantly different, with that of melon being the largest , followed by watermelon  and cucumber . it has already been reported that the region containing the nbs-lrr cluster in cucumber is shorter than the homologous region in melon  <cit> .phylogeny trees of the cucumber and watermelon r-genes were generated and drawn alongside the correspondent genomic distribution of genes, and orthologous relationships established between melon, cucumber, and watermelon r-genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  clusters a, c and d are present in the three cucurbits, although they appear to have undergone different amplification processes. in melon, there are six genes in cluster d, but only one in the other two species. similarly, while melon has five genes in cluster a, there are only one and two in, respectively, watermelon and cucumber, and cluster c contains six genes in melon but 3– <dig> in the other genomes. finally, cluster b appears to be absent from watermelon, while melon contains six genes and cucumber only three in this cluster.

the cc nbs-lrr cluster appears to have multiplied in melon from a common single gene present in all cucurbits. in the other cases, complex duplication events have occurred, although it seems clear that major amplification processes have taken place in melon since its divergence from the other species. similarly, r-gene duplications probably occurred after the divergence of the citrullus and cucumis genera. similar analyses in species in the rosaceae family, relatively close to cucurbits in evolutionary terms, show that the syntenic regions contain only one  or two genes   <cit> . therefore, a general pattern of nbs-lrr duplications in the analyzed region seems to have occurred at different stages since the divergence of the ancestral cucurbit and through speciation and diversification within the family.

finally, expression data from cucurbit unigene databases show that at least 50% of the annotated r-genes are probably expressed in some circumstances, with all four clusters a-d containing at least one such gene   <cit> .table  <dig>

comparison of the nbs-lrr gene sequences in melon varieties
it has already been shown that clusters of r-genes are hotspots of presence/absence of gene variability  <cit> . the melon nbs-lrr cluster region here analyzed, which shows the highest density of melon stress-response genes, also contains the highest concentration of pav polymorphisms, detected by comparing the genome sequences of five melon cultivars  <cit> . in particular, while clusters b and d had very high levels of pav, with nearly all genes in these regions probably absent from at least one of the cultivars analyzed, clusters a and c were relatively less affected by this kind of variability.

it is interesting to note that, when computing the variability in terms of snps, a similar correlation with variability being higher in some groups was found. this is shown in figure  <dig> where, for all five analyzed cultivars, the presence of snps is plotted against the clusters as total number of snps  or snps in the coding regions . it appears that cluster c has the lowest variability while cluster b has the highest. the comprehensive list of snps and small indels can be found in the additional file 5: table s <dig> figure  <dig>

one gene in the cluster is of special interest. it is the only gene to which a particular function can tentatively be attached on the basis of published information. this is the gene responsible for aphid resistance, vat, an economically important gene cloned in pi  <dig>  one of the parentals of the dhl <dig> melon line, and shown to be a cc-nbs-lrr gene syntenic to those found in cluster d  <cit> . however, the unambiguous identification of the vat orthologue in the cm <dig>  assembly was not possible, because protein sequences of all six genes in cluster d are highly similar and due to the multiple sequence gaps in the cluster. also, it is important to note that the published vat was cloned in pi  <dig> while the 1 mb region analyzed was from t- <dig> “piel de sapo”, the other parental of dhl <dig>  however, gene melo3c <dig>  which was only partially annotated in cm <dig>  due to several sequence gaps, was completely annotated in the refined version. the availability of the region immediately upstream of the gene, also missing in cm <dig> , allowed its identification as the orthologue of vat in dhl <dig> and “piel de sapo”, demonstrating the importance of genome draft sequence refinement. it is important to note that t- <dig>  unlike pi  <dig>  is sensitive to aphid colonization. figure  <dig> shows the comparison of the corresponding genome regions while additional file 6: file s <dig> shows the blastp alignment of the protein sequences. it can be observed that the overall structure of the two genes is very similar but with a major change in the length of the third intron. there are also a number of snps that have an effect on the protein sequence: a total of  <dig> amino acid changes were observed in the  <dig>  amino acid-long protein, and some of them cause significant changes in the amino acid type. therefore both point mutations and changes in gene structure were observed and could be responsible for the lack of aphid resistance in dhl <dig> figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
important sequence changes were observed in one of the most variable regions of the melon genome, which contains the highest defense-related gene density found in this species. however, good as the quality of the current melon genome assembly is, the complexity of this region as a sequencing target, due to a high degree of internal duplication, made necessary a refinement of the available sequence prior to any detailed analysis of the cluster of resistance genes. in this work, an approach combining the use of re-sequencing illumina data with pcr-based gap closing allowed us to reduce the amount of n-stretches by 80% and to correct about  <dig>  snps and small indels in the region of interest.

phylogeny analysis of the melon nbs-lrr gene cluster in the refined sequence and comparison with its syntenic counterparts in other cucurbit species allow us to conclude that new resistance genes have essentially been produced by sequence duplication in adjacent genome locations since the divergence of cucurbits from other close families, and through speciation processes within the family. comparison of different melon cultivars indicates that diverse mechanisms that generate variability are at work in the melon genome. presence/absence variation of genes previously described, but also single nucleotide mutations that appear to be diversely represented in different parts of the analyzed sequence, indicate that some genes may be important for specific functions but other groups may allow a higher degree of variability. these sequence changes are present in functional genes such as the vat resistance gene, where a high number of point mutations and a change in the gene structure are observed between the functional and non-functional genes.

the attribution of specific functions to members of the highly populated nbs-lrr gene family is an open question in plant biology. analysis of the different mechanisms acting on these highly variable genes may help to understand how plants adapt to different environments and provide useful strategies for plant breeding.
