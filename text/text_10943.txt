BACKGROUND
progressive regionalization events subdivide the early developing neural tube into a series of distinct units, which are marked by the expression of specific combinations of transcriptional regulators and signaling molecules. expression of many of these proteins broadly overlaps at early embryonic stages, but progressively restricts later in embryogenesis due to a series of positive and negative regulatory events. this leads to the generation of molecularly defined territories, which subsequently differentiate into anatomically and functionally different brain structures. a well-studied example for such regionalization events is the development of the mesencephalic alar plate, the anlage of the optic tectum in non-mammalian vertebrates or of the superior colliculus in mammals. the optic tectum develops from the caudal most part of the dorsal aspect of otx <dig> expression domain. otx <dig> expression is an essential prerequisite for the development of all anterior brain structures, which is evident in the lack of fore- and midbrain derived structures in otx <dig> mutant mice  <cit> . tectal development is tightly linked to the activity of the mid-hindbrain boundary  organizer, a group of cells located at the junction between the mesencephalic and metencephalic vesicles. cells of the mhb organizer secrete long-range and short-range signaling molecules, which are necessary and sufficient for the development of the adjacent mid- and hindbrain structures  <cit> . transplantation of the mhb region into the diencephalon, mesencephalon or rhombencephalon elicits the ectopic expression of mid-/hindbrain markers and the formation of ectopic polarized mesencephalic and cerebellar structures surrounding the graft  <cit> . this activity can be mimicked by local application of fgf <dig>  a secreted protein normally expressed within the mhb organizer territory  <cit> . induction and maintenance of fgf <dig> expression and mhb organizer activity depends on multileveled genetic interactions of transcription factors and signaling molecules, which include  the secreted molecules wnt <dig>  wnt3a and wnt10b, the nuclear proteins pax2/3/5/7/ <dig>  en <dig>  en <dig>  and lmx1b, all of which act in positive feedback loops with fgf <dig>  <cit> . conversely, feedback antagonists of fgf <dig> signaling such as sef, spry <dig>  spry <dig> and mkp <dig> confine the organizer activity to a narrow ring of cells at the mid-hindbrain junction  <cit> . positive and negative autoregulation thus shapes and maintains the mhb organizer.

two transcription factors reported to contribute to mhb organizer maintenance are the paired-box transcription factors pax <dig> and pax <dig>  <cit> . both proteins share extensive homologies in protein sequence and expression patterns and are therefore believed to have arisen from a gene duplication event  <cit> . the importance of pax <dig> in dorsal neural tube and neural crest patterning and differentiation is evident in the human syndromes associated with pax <dig> mutations  as well as in mouse splotch mutants. by contrast, pax <dig> mutant mice do not display major defects in central nervous system development, which suggests a significant degree of functional overlap of the two pax proteins  <cit> . in fact, knock-in of pax <dig> can rescue the central nervous system and neural crest defects associated with the pax3/splotch mutant phenotype  <cit> . in chick embryos, pax <dig> and pax <dig> are expressed from the ten somite stage onwards in nested domains within the dorsal neural tube. by the 25- <dig> somite stage, mesencephalic pax <dig> expression extends more ventrally than that of pax <dig>  whereas only pax <dig> expression reaches rostrally into the telencephalic vesicle [ <cit> ; and figure 1). although expression of both genes is not specific for the mid-hindbrain territory, ectopic expression of either one induced expression of mhb organizer associated genes including fgf <dig> and en <dig> and elicited development of ectopic tectal structures  <cit> .

we have previously reported a pivotal role for meis <dig> in tectal development  <cit> . meis <dig> belongs to the tale  class of homeodomain containing proteins, which function as regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation of various tissues and organs during development. meis family proteins form dimeric and trimeric complexes with other transcription factors, including the closely related pbx family, members of the hox clusters, several other homeodomain containing proteins and some basic helix-loop-helix  proteins  <cit> . mesencephalic meis <dig> expression commences around the 19- <dig> somite stage and thus later than pax <dig> and pax <dig>  within the mesencephalic vesicle, meis <dig> is largely confined to the tectal anlagen with sharp expression boundaries to the diencephalon and the mhb territory  <cit> . meis <dig> is both necessary and sufficient for tectal development: introduction of a function blocking form of meis <dig> into the mesencephalic vesicle abolishes normal tectal development, whereas a single, transient transfection of meis <dig> in the diencephalic vesicle triggers the development of ectopic tectal structures. meis <dig> lies downstream of fgf <dig> in the hierarchy of tectum inducing genes, autoregulates its own expression and thereby stabilizes tectal fate  <cit> . the underlying mechanism, however, is only partially understood. one unique feature of meis <dig> is its ability to induce a di- to mesencephalic fate change without any noticeable induction of fgf <dig> expression. instead, meis <dig> directly interacts with otx <dig> and competes with the groucho co-repressor protein tle <dig> for binding to otx <dig>  thereby releasing otx <dig> from tle <dig> mediated repression  <cit> . whether meis <dig> also associates with transcriptional regulators of tectal development other than otx <dig> and what molecules regulate meis <dig> expression levels within the mesencephalic alar plate is not known yet. this is important, since meis <dig> autostimulates its own expression in the tectal anlage  <cit> . some restraint needs therefore to be in place to prevent exuberant autoactivation of meis <dig>  so far, the nature of any inhibitory activity on meis <dig> expression within the developing optic tectum remained elusive.

here, we report a series of gain of function and biochemical experiments performed in chick embryos, which suggest that i) ectopic pax <dig> expression induces pax <dig>  ii) elevated expression levels of pax <dig> reduce expression of pax <dig> and meis <dig>  but at different concentrations, which suggests meis <dig> expression requires a specific concentration threshold of pax <dig> and pax <dig>  and iii) both paired domain proteins form heteromeric complexes with meis <dig>  these results show that interdependent regulatory loops involving pax <dig>  pax <dig> and meis <dig> exist in the tectal anlage and argue for a more general role of meis <dig> as co-factor of different transcriptional regulators of tectal development.

RESULTS
meis <dig>  pax <dig> and pax <dig> are expressed in nested territories in the tectal anlage
a hallmark of early mid-/hindbrain fate specification is the mutual cross-regulation of proteins, which are expressed across the mhb organizer. much less is known, however, about genetic interactions that may occur in the tectal anlage after initial fate specification has taken place. as a first step, we therefore compared the expression domains of pax <dig>  pax <dig> and meis <dig>  consistent with previous reports, we detected pax <dig> and pax <dig> transcripts at hamburger hamilton  stage  <dig>  in the alar plates of the spinal cord, and of the met-, mes- and diencephalic vesicles extending anteriorly to include prosomere  <dig>   <cit> . pax <dig> was additionally expressed along the telencephalic midline. in contrast, meis <dig> expression was absent from the met-, di- and telencephalon, but strongly expressed in the mesencephalic vesicle   <cit> . one day later, at hh <dig> , pax <dig>  pax <dig> and meis <dig> transcripts were still abundant in the tectal anlage, as in-situ hybridization on adjacent vibratome sections showed .

overexpression of pax <dig> induces pax <dig> but represses meis2- and ephrin-b1
to investigate a possible relationship between pax <dig> and pax <dig> in the midbrain, we ectopically delivered an expression plasmid carrying pax <dig> together with gfp  by in ovo electroporation into the right lateral wall of the mesencephalic vesicle at hh9-hh <dig> . due to the shot-gun nature of this gene delivery method, random patches of gfp expression, indicative of groups of cells forced to express the gfp and pax <dig> transgenes, were seen across the right mesencephalic wall . consistent with a previous report, we found that in these patches pax <dig> expression was strongly induced as early as  <dig> hours following pax <dig> misexpression ; figure 2b, b', c)  <cit> . robust upregulation of pax <dig> expression was still visible  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours after pmes-pax <dig> transfection . ectopic pax <dig> expression was also observed when pax <dig> misexpression was specifically targeted to the ventral midbrain ; figure 2e). scattered groups of cells expressing elevated levels of pax <dig> transcripts were not only located within the territory of the endogenous pax <dig> domains, but also reached ventrally towards the nkx <dig>  expression domain . a comparison of figure 2b' and figure 2b" revealed that apparently not all pax7-gfp positive cells also express pax <dig> mrna, especially not in the ventral midbrain. this may be due to the short incubation time of the embryos after electroporation  and may thus reflect incomplete upregulation of pax <dig> by pax <dig>  in addition, gene delivery by in ovo electroporation causes targeted cells to take up varying amounts of dna. considering that ectopic induction of pax <dig> may need a certain threshold of pax <dig> protein , it is possible that the ectopic pax <dig> levels may not have reached the threshold necessary for pax <dig> induction in all gfp-positive cells. in any case however, ectopic pax <dig> expressing cells in the ventral mesencephalon were consistently positive for pax <dig> 

two lines of evidence from our previous study suggested that meis <dig> may not act upstream, but rather downstream of or in parallel to pax <dig> and pax7:  electroporation of a function blocking form of meis <dig> into the mesencephalic vesicle had not affected pax <dig> or pax <dig> expression and  ectopic delivery of meis <dig> into the diencephalon was not sufficient to induce expression of either pax gene . to explore a reciprocal relationship of the three proteins, we assessed meis <dig> expression following pax <dig> misexpression. contrary to our initial expectation, meis <dig> specific transcripts were reduced in the midbrain vesicle after forced expression of pax <dig> compared to embryos transfected with gfp alone, ; figure 3a, b-b", e). likewise, expression of ephrinb <dig> , a downstream target of meis <dig> in the tectal anlage, was also diminished in pax <dig> electroporated embryos ; figure 3c, d-d', e)  <cit> . thus, although all three genes are co-expressed within the tectal anlage, elevating pax <dig> expression levels increased pax <dig> but repressed meis <dig> expression under identical experimental conditions.

midbrain meis2- and pax <dig> expression are repressed by pax <dig> in a dose dependent manner
to further explore this apparent contradiction, we ectopically expressed a ha-tagged form or pax <dig>  in the mesencephalic vesicle. meis <dig> expression was generally not affected following electroporation of concentrations between  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/μl of the pax <dig> expressing plasmid ; n = 1/ <dig> following electroporation of  <dig>  μg/μl ; n = 0/ <dig> following electroporation of  <dig> μg/μl ; figure 4a, b, g). in contrast, transfection of  <dig> μg/μl of pmiwiii-pax3-ha effectively repressed meis <dig> transcripts ; figure 4c, g). electroporation of  <dig> μg/μl of pmiwiii-pax3-ha also repressed efnb <dig> expression , figure 4d). notably, pax <dig> specific transcripts were lost in the dorsal midbrain already at a concentration of  <dig> μg/μl pmiwiii-pax3-ha ;  <dig> μg/μl: n = 8/ <dig> ; figure 4e, f, g and data not shown). thus, pax <dig>  like meis <dig>  is negatively regulated by pax <dig>  but repression of pax <dig> occurs already at half the concentration of the pax <dig> expressing plasmid required to repress meis <dig> or its downstream gene efnb <dig>  in summary, these results suggest that pax <dig> induces pax <dig> and pax <dig> represses pax <dig> in the dorsal midbrain leading to tightly balanced expression levels of both proteins, which in turn are permissive for expression of meis <dig> and its target gene efnb <dig> 

meis2-pax <dig> and meis2-pax <dig> containing protein complexes exist in the tectal anlage
as we reported previously, meis <dig> forms heteromeric complexes with otx <dig> in the tectal anlage and binding to meis <dig> is necessary for otx <dig> to induce ectopic tectal development upon misexpression in the metencephalic alar plate  <cit> . based on these observations and because of the two proteins only meis <dig> expression is specific for the prospective optic tectum , we had suggested that complex formation with meis <dig> may confer tectal specificity to otx <dig> in the dorsal midbrain, where both transcription factors are co-expressed. pax <dig> and pax <dig> can also trigger ectopic tectal development when misexpressed  <cit> . however, like for otx <dig>  their expression is not specific for the tectal anlage, but includes the alar plate along most of its length  <cit> . we therefore decided to examine whether meis <dig> may interact with pax <dig> or pax <dig> in the dorsal mesencephalic vesicle. in gst-pull down experiments using a gst-tagged form of meis <dig> and protein extracts prepared from hh 15- <dig> chick mesencephalic vesicle pax <dig> and pax <dig> readily precipitated with meis2-gst but not with gst alone. pax <dig> and pax <dig> can thus associate with recombinant meis <dig> . when meis2-specific antibodies were used to precipitate endogenous meis2-containing protein complexes pax <dig> and pax <dig> were successfully enriched in the precipitates. isotype-specific control antibodies, however, were not successful . precipitation of pax <dig> was significantly reduced when a truncated form of meis <dig> lacking the meinox domain fused to gst  was used and completely abolished when a truncated form lacking the homeodomain fused to gst  was used.

to confirm that both truncated forms are active, we tested them for their ability to bind to the pbc class homeodomain protein pbx <dig>  a known meis interacting partner, or to dna respectively. meis proteins bind to pbc class proteins via their meinox domain, a bipartite protein interaction domain located n-terminal of the homeodomain   <cit> . accordingly, full length meis <dig> and meis2Δhd successfully precipitated pbx1b, whereas meis2Δmd and gst were ineffective . meis family proteins recognize variations of the consensus sequence motif 5'-tgata-3' in the regulatory regions of target genes  <cit> . although meis proteins frequently cooperate with pbc class proteins in binding to dna, examples of pbx independent dna binding are also known  <cit> . we therefore performed electromobility shift assays  with purified meis2-gst fusion proteins and a 32p-labeled oligonucleotide probe, which was previously shown to be bound by meis independently of pbx  <cit> . complex formation of the probe was observed with full-length meis <dig> and meis2Δmd but not with meis2Δhd or gst alone . excess of a non-labeled specific oligonucleotide effectively competed for full length meis <dig> or meis2Δmd dna binding .

gst-fusion proteins lacking the amino acids n-terminal to the meinox domain  or meis <dig> lacking the transactivation domain, which is located c-terminal to the homeodomain , also effectively precipitated pax <dig> and pbx1b   <cit> . we therefore conclude that the meinox domain and homeodomain of meis <dig> are involved in the association with pax <dig> and pax <dig>  complex formation between meis <dig> and pax <dig> was also seen when an antibody specific for pax <dig> was used in the immunoprecipitation experiments . the relatively weak meis2-specific band in the ip with the pax7-specific antibody compared to the robust co-precipitation of pax <dig> with the meis2-specific antibody may indicate that only a fraction of the meis <dig> protein present in the extracts is bound to pax <dig>  and immunoprecipitate with Δ-pax <dig> in figure 5g). to test whether meis <dig> forms multimeric complexes with pax <dig> and otx <dig>  we re-probed the blot with an antibody directed against otx <dig> . contrary to meis <dig>  otx <dig> was not detected in the immunoprecipitate. we were also not able to precipitate pax <dig> with an otx <dig> specific antibody . although we cannot rule out that the antibodies used in our precipitation experiments may, to different extents, interfere with the ability of their antigens to engage in multiprotein interactions, our results argue against the existence of large multimeric complexes involving meis <dig>  otx <dig> and pax <dig>  instead, we propose that meis <dig> may form heteromeric complexes with either pax <dig> or pax <dig> or otx <dig> in the dorsal mesencephalic vesicle.

discussion
based on in ovo electroporation and immunoprecipitation experiments in chick embryos, we here provide experimental evidence for reciprocal regulation and subsequent physical interaction of pax <dig>  pax <dig> and meis <dig> in the tectal anlage.

dose-dependent and reciprocal regulation of pax <dig> and pax <dig> in the tectal anlage
interdependent regulation between pax <dig> and pax <dig> has been reported in other physiological contexts before. pax <dig> transcripts, for instance, are upregulated in the embryonic dorsal spinal cord of splotch mice, a naturally occurring mutant of pax <dig>  suggesting that in mouse spinal cord pax <dig> normally functions to repress pax <dig>  <cit> . in xenopus laevis embryos, on the other hand, expression of pax <dig> and pax <dig> in the neural tube and neural crest strikingly differs from that in mice and chicks, which indicates different functional specifications of both genes in amphibians compared to mammals and birds  <cit> . indeed, morpholino-mediated knock down of pax <dig> or misexpression of a function blocking form of pax <dig> reduced pax <dig> transcript levels in the xenopus spinal cord, suggesting that pax <dig> positively regulates pax <dig> in amphibians  <cit> . although species specific differences obviously exist, in summation these results argue for interdependent regulation of pax <dig> and pax <dig> in the spinal cord. the observations reported in the present study extend this reciprocal regulation of both pax proteins to the embryonic mesencephalon and point to a possible dose-dependent function of pax <dig> during tectal development. since pax <dig> and pax <dig> are closely related and forced expression of either molecule in the diencephalon leads to identical cell fate changes, pax <dig> and pax <dig> were suggested to play redundant functions during tectal development  <cit> . the cross-regulation between pax <dig> and pax <dig> we report here may allow for a tight, mutual regulation of both gene products, which prevents over-activation of shared downstream pathways and at the same time permits functional compensation if one of the genes is mutated.

examples for dose dependent functions of transcriptional regulators are well known in invertebrate development. in the early d. melanogaster embryo, for instance, spatial gradients of transcription factors control the expression of distinct sets of target genes, which ultimately control morphogenesis  <cit> . similar dose dependent activities have also been reported for transcription factors that engage in reciprocal regulation. oligodendrocyte differentiation in the embryonic vertebrate spinal cord, for instance, depends on the concerted activities of olig <dig>  sox <dig> and nkx <dig> . this process not only requires mutual regulation of the three proteins but also depends on the gene dosage of olig <dig>  as both haploinsufficiency and overexpression of olig <dig> significantly delayed oligodendrocyte maturation  <cit> . dosage dependent developmental defects also exist for the paired-type transcription factor pax <dig> in both human and mice  <cit> . mice heterozygote for pax <dig>  display ocular defects with small eyes and malformations of the anterior eye chamber, as do mice carrying multiple copies of a pax6-containing yac   <cit> . the underlying mechanism of such dosage dependent requirement of transcriptional regulators is only partially understood at present. one evident explanation takes into account that transcription factors frequently function in the context of larger multiprotein complexes, which involve other dna binding proteins as well as transcriptional co-regulators that modulate chromatin dynamics. since the stoichiometry of these transcriptional complexes must be tightly controlled, too much or too little of any given component may disturb the formation of functional complexes and consequently result in insufficient transcriptional activity. changing the intracellular concentration of individual transcription factors into either direction may therefore adversely affect expression of their target genes and ultimately lead to similar developmental defects.

an intriguing second explanation of how the net activation of an enhancer can be directly linked to different concentrations of a given transcription factor comes from studies of transcription factor gradients in early d. melanogaster embryos. here, the bicoid protein binds individual recognition sites in the regulatory region of its target gene hunchback with different affinities. this ensures that high-affinity binding sites can already be bound and activated by low concentrations of the protein, whereas high bicoid levels are needed to activate low-affinity sites  <cit> . likewise, rowan and colleagues recently reported that the pax <dig> lens enhancer was synergistically regulated by multiple prep <dig> proteins, each non-cooperatively bound to a low-affinity binding site  <cit> . both examples provide a mechanism of how different concentrations of a given transcription factor can be directly translated into the net activity of a target enhancer. pax <dig> may therefore directly modulate pax <dig> and meis <dig> expression, potentially by binding to target sides in the enhancers of each gene that differ in their relative affinity for pax <dig> . a detailed comparison of the midbrain-specific regulatory regions of meis <dig> and pax <dig> would be needed to test this hypothesis. however, although upstream regulatory elements of pax <dig> have been identified, none of them faithfully recapitulates expression in the mesencephalic alar plate and meis <dig> enhancer elements have remained elusive so far  <cit> . nevertheless it is worth pointing out that recognition sequences with different binding affinities for pax <dig> have been identified in vitro and that differences in the affinity of pax <dig> to these sites mediate varying levels of transactivation  <cit> .

alternatively, pax <dig> and pax <dig> may control meis <dig> expression indirectly . this model takes into account that both pax proteins were shown to trigger expression of mhb associated genes, including fgf <dig>  when ectopically expressed in the anterior neural tube  <cit> . we have previously found that meis <dig> transcriptional activation requires low levels of ras-mapk pathway activity that are characteristic for the mesencephalic vesicle, but is inhibited by strong ras-mapk signals, which induce metencephalic fate specification  <cit> . hence, pax <dig> and pax <dig> might impinge on meis <dig> expression indirectly through modulating fgf <dig> expression levels  at the mhb organizer. irrespective of whether pax <dig> and pax <dig> act directly or indirectly on meis <dig> expression, interdependent and balanced expression of both paired proteins may serve to prevent excessive autoactivation of meis <dig> in the tectal anlage.

multiple transcriptional regulators associate with meis <dig> in the tectal anlage
functional subdivision of the brain is preceded by the restricted expression of transcriptional regulators at neural tube stages. the anlagen of the optic tecta, originating from the alar plates of the mesencephalic vesicle, for instance are characterized by the combinatorial expression of otx <dig>  pax <dig>  pax <dig>  and meis <dig> . notably, all four proteins can instruct tectal fate when ectopically delivered to the alar plate of adjacent brain vesicles, but only meis <dig> expression faithfully demarcates the prospective optic tecta. otx <dig> expression encompasses the entire neural tube anterior of the mhb and pax <dig> and pax <dig> are present in the alar plates along most of the neural tubes anterior-posterior axis  <cit> .

as we demonstrated previously, meis <dig> forms heteromeric complexes with otx <dig> in the mesencephalon and association with meis <dig> can restore full transcriptional activity of otx <dig> in the presence of the co-repressor tle <dig> in an otx <dig> dependent reporter assay  <cit> . this observation prompted us to suggest that meis <dig> may act as tectum-specific cofactor of otx <dig>  we can now extend this observation to include pax <dig> and pax <dig>  association of meis <dig> with pax <dig> and pax <dig> was observed in vitro and endogenous meis2-pax containing protein complexes could be precipitated from tectal tissue. notably however, we failed to detect interaction of pax <dig> and otx <dig>  suggesting that meis <dig> forms individual complexes with each of these proteins.

the identification of meis2-pax containing nuclear complexes has also implications for the general concept of tale-hd protein function. all pax proteins except pax <dig> and pax <dig> contain an octapeptide motif, a conserved stretch of eight amino acids related to the eh <dig> domain. the eh <dig> domain mediates transcriptional repressor activity through recruitment of co-repressors of the tle/grg family. indeed, pax <dig> can directly associate with grg <dig> or other transcriptional co-repressors and has been implicated in transcriptional repression in several physiological contexts  <cit> . the meis <dig> - pax3/ <dig> interaction reported here suggests that meis <dig> can be part of transcriptional activator as well as repressor complexes. in this context it is worth noting that tectal fate specification not only requires the activation of tectum specific genes, but also the repression of competing cellular fates. indeed, meis <dig> is not only positively regulates the expression of tectum associated genes such as efnb <dig> or dbx <dig>  but also represses the diencephalic marker gene pax <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have previously shown that the tale-homeodomain protein meis <dig> acts downstream of the mhb organizer and controls tectal development by cooperating with otx <dig>  the results described here expand this view and suggest that tectal meis <dig> expression levels are modulated by pax <dig> and pax <dig> and that the expression levels of both pax proteins have to be tightly balanced to allow for expression of meis <dig>  in addition, we find that meis <dig> not only associates with otx <dig> in dorsal mesencephalic vesicle but also with pax <dig> and pax <dig>  meis <dig> is the only known transcriptional regulator so far that is able to instruct tectal fate specification and whose expression specifically marks the tectal anlage at mid to late somite stages. we therefore propose that spatially controlled association with meis <dig> may serve as a general mechanism to confer tectal specificity to a wide range of otherwise broadly expressed transcription factors.
