BACKGROUND
the aim of this study was to identify and quantify apoptosis at different stages of meiotic prophase i in mouse oocytes, in order to explore the relationship between chromosomal activity during meiosis, and the occurrence of cell death by apoptosis.

most mammalian oocytes die long before they reach maturity, having no direct role in forming the next generation. extensive loss of immature oocytes occurs at various stages in mice:  during meiotic prophase i, the prenatal process of oocyte formation;  in the first days after birth when oocytes that have not been enclosed into primordial follicles suffer demise and  when the ovarian follicle that nurtures the oocyte succumbs to atresia. follicular recruitment, growth and atresia are tightly controlled by intra-ovarian factors and gonadotrophic hormones. however, the factors balancing oocyte formation and loss prenatally have received less attention, even though these are crucial for establishing the size and quality of the ovarian reserve.

the biological basis for the prenatal cull of oocytes remains unexplained. for example, it may be a developmental solution to accumulated mutations in mitochondria  <cit> , a means of avoiding inheritance of potentially lethal errors arising during germ cell mitosis or meiotic prophase i  <cit> , or an altruistic process ensuring survival of some oocytes within a particular sibling 'nest'  <cit> .

while oocyte populations behave predictably, the factors controlling survival or death of individual oocytes remain obscure. synaptic problems are common and may promote oocyte loss  <cit>  while defects in recombination caused by dna repair insufficiency can trigger meiotic arrest  <cit> . thus, selective elimination based on meiotic abnormality could promote the survival of more normal oocytes to the ovarian pool  <cit> . however, these quality control mechanisms are not completely efficient, allowing some abnormal oocytes to continue developing. in humans, mature oocytes have an exceptionally high rate of around 20% aneuploidy  <cit> . such aneuploidies may have their origin in meiotic prophase i and are recognised contributors to the low fertility of humans, the high miscarriage rate, and certain prevalent conditions such as trisomy  <dig> down's syndrome  <cit> . an understanding of the origins of abnormal oocytes, and the biological methods for their control, has potential to improve reproductive outcome. we are therefore interested in how abnormalities in oocytes during meiotic prophase i relate to the occurrence of apoptosis. these experiments in mice complement and extend our studies of human prenatal oogenesis  <cit> .

in mice, early studies indicated that cell death affects proliferating primordial germ cells or oogonia in 12– <dig> dpc ovaries, and also oocytes at the zygotene/pachytene stage of meiotic prophase i, from  <dig> dpc through to birth . in humans, oocyte loss has been reported particularly at the pachytene stage, using electron microscopic identification of meiotic chromosomes  <cit> . prenatal loss of oocytes may involve apoptosis  <cit>  although this view has been challenged  <cit> . several approaches have been made to characterise apoptotic oocytes in mouse fetal ovaries. small oocytes with reduced dna content were observed at  <dig>  dpc  <cit>  and increased on  <dig>  and  <dig>  dpc  <cit> , dna ladders  have been detected by gel electrophoresis, and dna fragmentation in oocytes has been detected by tunel applied to ovarian tissue sections  <cit> . the germ cell specific marker vasa, has been applied together with poly  polymerase  and tunel as apoptotic markers  <cit> . the latter used ovarian tissue sections to show that mouse germ cell apoptosis occurs predominantly from  <dig>  to  <dig>  dpc when oocytes are mainly in the diplotene stage. previous publications therefore differ in their interpretation of the risks of oocyte death by apoptosis during the stages of meiotic prophase i.

the study of apoptosis in oocytes is challenging for two reasons. first, dna breaks, often used as a marker of apoptosis, are integral to meiosis, particularly during the leptotene stage, when dna strands condense before synapsis  <cit> . hence, methods detecting dna breaks, such as tunel, must be combined with apoptosis-specific markers, in order to avoid false positive results  <cit> . second, identification of stages of meiotic prophase i has not been straightforward. histological methods permit differences in interpretation, causing widespread variations in results, notable in studies of human fetal ovaries . more recently, the availability of molecular methods to identify meiotic chromosomes categorically  <cit>  and to ascribe their meiotic stages with certainty in large numbers of individual cells has prompted us to re-examine the timing of apoptosis in relation to meiotic prophase i.

RESULTS
we studied a total of  <dig> oocytes from  <dig> mouse fetuses or neonates from  <dig>  to  <dig> dpc. the relationship between oocyte development and death during meiotic prophase i was investigated according to the stage of meiotic prophase i, the appearance of axial elements and also their cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel labelling. figure  <dig> presents examples of labelled spread oocytes.

progression of oocytes during meiotic prophase i
overall, the numbers of oocytes in meiotic prophase i, observed using cor <dig> labelling, increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> dpc and approximately halved at day  <dig>  the day of birth in these mice. figure  <dig> shows the numbers of oocytes observed according to age, and stage of meiotic prophase i, indicating the proportions having intact, compressed or fragmented elements. the numbers of oocytes observed are not necessarily representative of the total in ovaries since we only observed those oocytes that remained affixed to slides after microspreading, fixation and washing. however, we are not aware of any evidence that the attachment of chromosomes is biased towards any particular type of cell.

oocytes with fragmented axial elements comprised 10–25% of zygotene, pachytene and diplotene oocytes, and 33% of unstaged oocytes. some fragmented oocytes were noted each day from  <dig>  to  <dig> dpc, however they were particularly evident on day  <dig>  . compressed oocytes  comprised 17–35% of oocytes at zygotene to diplotene stages, and 65% of unstaged oocytes . compressed oocytes were the predominant fraction on day  <dig> when they comprised 75% of the total. as will be discussed later, the lack of spreading  could be related to compromised membrane function in the degenerating oocytes. therefore, compared to spread oocytes, compressed oocytes may represent cells with lower viability. nine oocytes were classed as abnormal.

the distribution of oocytes across the stages of meiotic prophase i varied with age as expected . unstaged oocytes were notable mainly after  <dig> dpc. interestingly, there were two waves of zygotene oocytes on  <dig>  and  <dig> dpc and pachytene oocytes on 16– <dig> and  <dig> dpc .

factors affecting oocyte labelling with cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel
the oocytes in each category of cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel labelling  were analysed as a proportion of the total numbers of oocytes observed on the slide of the same ovary. the majority of p+ oocytes were also t+, as expected from the relationship between cleaved parp- <dig> and dna damage during apoptosis, however, isolated t+ labelling of oocytes was also evident, as we had predicted. labelling for cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel varied according to the stage of meiotic prophase i and age post-coitum  . oocytes staining for neither cleaved parp- <dig> nor tunel were the largest fraction at all stages of meiotic prophase i.

the data were then analysed according to stage of meiotic prophase i on certain dpc, to determine whether oocytes entering meiosis earlier or later than average were more prone to apoptosis, as has been suggested by park and taketo  <cit> .

at the leptotene stage, t+ oocytes predominated on  <dig>  dpc , as might be expected from the chromosomal reorganisation taking place in early meiosis  <cit> . however, by  <dig>  dpc, leptotene oocytes appeared to be either apoptotic  or potentially viable  .

at subsequent stages of development, oocytes exhibited all possible combinations of parp- <dig> and tunel staining, irrespective of whether their axial elements, highlighted by cor <dig>  appeared intact or fragmented. there was no evidence to suggest that oocytes that entered meiosis earlier or later had different profiles of staining for tunel and cleaved parp- <dig>  it is notable that a few zygotene and pachytene oocytes that were apparently viable  and had intact elements, were identified up to two days after birth . on  <dig> dpc,  <dig> % of oocytes were classified as intact pachytene cells, reducing to  <dig> % on  <dig> dpc. interestingly, diplotene oocytes increased as expected towards the time of birth. however, at day  <dig>  the principal group of diplotene oocytes was undergoing apoptosis, as shown by p+t+ staining .

statistical analysis of data pooled across time points showed that oocytes at the diplotene stage had a significantly different staining profile to those at pachytene or zygotene stages, regardless of whether their elements were intact or fragmented, having a higher likelihood of p+t+ labelling . at the zygotene, pachytene and diplotene stages, oocytes with fragmented axial elements were less likely to show t+ or p+ labelling than those with intact axial elements . additionally, oocytes having compressed chromosomes were significantly more likely to stain for cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel than those with intact or fragmented axial elements . zygotene and pachytene oocytes with compressed elements were also more likely to be p+t- than if their elements were intact or fragmented . a similar relationship was not found for the unstaged oocytes.

a number of questions arising from the data presented have bearing upon the detection of normality and viability in fetal oocytes, and upon our understanding of the processes governing prenatal oocyte selection. these will be highlighted below.

can the appearance of synaptonemal complex staining define oocyte viability?
since a large proportion of prenatal oocytes will die, we wished to understand, firstly, whether oocytes in meiotic prophase i could be ascribed reliably as viable or non-viable on the basis of the visual appearance of their immunostained axial elements. there is considerable discrepancy in the literature concerning the interpretation of microscopic images of meiotic cells as well as the optimal means of cell preparation to obtain ideal cytogenetic spreads. for example, non-intact elements observed microscopically have been interpreted as abnormal, non-viable or degenerating  <cit>  as well as potentially artifactual  <cit> .

we found that oocytes with fragmented elements were a relatively consistent proportion of the total at all stages of meiotic prophase i , averaging  <dig> %. this was similar to the  <dig> % noted by martinez-flores et al  <cit>  in rats using procedures optimised to minimise artifactual fragmentation. the reason for the increased fragmentation on day  <dig> is unclear. technical variation has been discounted because mice from different litters gave the same results. oocytes with fragmented axial elements were less likely to stain for cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel. although this finding was significant, its impact was modest because such oocytes represented a relatively small proportion of the total. overall, staining of oocytes with fragmented axial elements was broadly similar to those with intact axial elements, i.e. the majority remaining unstained for cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel, despite fragmented axial elements. we therefore conclude that fragmentation of axial elements observed through immunocytochemistry of cor <dig> is not indicative of a parp- <dig> dependent apoptotic process of oocyte degeneration. nevertheless, fragmentation of scs is associated with abnormal oogenesis in some mutant mice  <cit> . therefore, its association with non-apoptotic degeneration, or apoptosis via a pathway independent of parp- <dig>  cannot be excluded.

cytogenetic spreading favours viable cells
we also explored whether cytogenetic spreads of fetal ovaries produce preparations that are representative of the prenatal oocyte population. we examined all oocytes identified by cor <dig> staining, regardless of spread appearance, because we thought that the spreading method may selectively prepare viable cells. spreading includes incubation in hypotonic solution to promote membrane rupture and efficient removal of cytoplasm  <cit> , which may thereby cause under-representation of oocytes in apoptosis or with poor membrane function. our findings support this contention. the oocytes we observed with compressed elements had nuclei that spread less  and were also more likely to stain for cleaved parp- <dig>  a marker of apoptosis. coucouvanis et al.  <cit>  have also reported condensed nuclei as features of apoptotic oocytes. such oocytes are a major population at meiotic prophase i , although they are unlikely to contribute to the ovarian reserve. they may therefore have been overlooked in studies where only oocytes producing good quality spreads were analysed. we therefore decided to include these compressed oocytes because their exclusion, based on their suboptimal response to the spreading technique, may be a misrepresentation of the dynamics of cell death within the fetal ovary.

interestingly, we noted an increase in such compressed oocytes on day  <dig>  soon after birth, heralding the dramatic reduction of oocyte numbers known to occur from birth  <cit> . the high proportion of p+t+ diplotene oocytes at day  <dig> may be a later manifestation of this phenomenon of postnatal oocyte death.

progress of meiotic prophase i
the increasing numbers of oocytes observed between  <dig>  and  <dig> dpc and the profile of stages of meiotic prophase i suggest that female germ cells are entering meiosis gradually, as expected  <cit> , notwithstanding technical losses of cells during processing. data from mcclellan et al.  <cit>  using cd <dig> mice show a similar profile of stages of meiotic prophase i, although they did not observe diplotene oocytes until the day of birth , whereas we observed them in substantial numbers from  <dig> dpc . the rate of progress of meiotic prophase i has been reported to differ in different strains of mice  <cit>  which may account for this difference. the time profile of meiotic prophase i in our study, showed two 'waves' of zygotene oocytes on  <dig>  and  <dig> dpc and two 'waves' of pachytene oocytes on 16– <dig> and  <dig> dpc . the existence of two waves of pachytene oocytes in b6cbf <dig> mice is consistent with other data from our group  and could be a genetic effect  <cit> . biphasic observations of prenatal oocyte degeneration and the premeiotic s phase have been reported in rats  <cit> .

meiotic prophase i in female mice is non-synchronous and probably takes about four days. the durations of the leptotene, zygotene and pachytene stages in mice were estimated at 3– <dig> hours, 12– <dig> hours and > <dig> hours respectively by crone et al  <cit>  using tritium labelling studies. our data show some discrepancies from this approximation, as follows: first, the interval between the first appearance of pachytene at  <dig>  dpc and diplotene at  <dig> dpc is shorter than the expected > <dig> h duration reported by crone et al  <cit> . our data may suggest either a shorter pachytene stage or a difference in the interpretation of the onset of diplotene, perhaps caused by technical differences between the immunocytogenetic spreads that we used and the autoradiographed sections used by crone et al  <cit> . second, zygotene oocytes remain a major fraction until  <dig> dpc, while leptotene oocytes are not seen beyond  <dig> dpc . this  <dig> day interval is longer than the estimated maximum of  <dig> hours from crone et al.  <cit> , suggesting a prolonged zygotene stage in at least some oocytes, probably including the 'second wave' zygotene oocytes that we observed on  <dig> dpc  and potentially also the pre-diplotene oocytes remaining after birth. prolonged early meiosis has been associated with persistence of the bouquet stage consequent upon compromised dna repair, essential for recombination . it may be hypothesised that constraints upon the progression of meiosis, such as the necessity for dna repair, difficulties with homologous chromosome identification or pairing, or other undefined problems, may indicate an oocyte that is abnormal or has reduced gametogenic potential. the major reduction in zygotene and pachytene cells around birth, whether or not mediated via apoptosis, may thus constitute a selection mechanism against developmentally incompetent oocytes that have failed to reach the diplotene stage and accrete a follicle. if this idea is correct, this mechanism might explain some of the variability in oocyte apoptosis, described in the next section, rather than the pachytene arrest that is well known in males  <cit> .

the persistence of some zygotene and intact pachytene oocytes between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, without indications of apoptosis, has not previously been reported. this finding confirms earlier histological and electron microscopic observations on newborn mice  <cit>  but is contrary to the report of mcclellan et al  <cit>  in cd <dig> mice. mcclellan et al  <cit>  detected early diplotene oocytes after birth, but zygotene oocytes were absent and pachytene oocytes represented <1% of the total. recent contributions have revisited the idea that oocyte production may continue into maturity through the persistence of non-meiotic germinal stem cells after birth  <cit> , however, the postnatal longevity of oocytes in prediplotene stages of meiotic prophase i is unknown and further data are required.

apoptosis detection in oocytes
molecular localisation of apoptotic and meiotic markers in microspread oocyte nuclei offers a powerful tool to unravel the inter-related processes of meiosis and apoptosis through detailed analysis of many individual oocytes.

when we studied oocytes using cleaved parp- <dig> and tunel labelling, both p+t+ and p-t- germ cells were identified at the preleptotene stage. positivity for cleaved parp- <dig> indicates that some germ cells may be lost through apoptosis even as they enter meiosis. this agrees with previous findings that cell death affects proliferating primordial germ cells or oogonia as well as oocytes at the zygotene, pachytene and/or diplotene stages  <cit> .

the high proportion of p+t+ cells at the preleptotene and leptotene stages on  <dig>  dpc  are a consequence of apoptosis, whereas those with isolated t+ labelling probably have meiotic double strand breaks . dsbs appear early in meiotic prophase i , prior to the formation of mature scp <dig>  and disappear in zygotene as synapsis progresses  <cit> . active rna synthesis can also result in tunel positivity in tissue sections  <cit> . while rna synthesis may occur during all stages of meiotic prophase i excepting the pachytene stage and particularly at the diplotene stage  <cit> , the spreading methods we used are likely to have removed this confounding influence. consistent with this, we did not observe a stage-related incidence of isolated t+ labelling.

interestingly, we found that tunel did not highlight all leptotene oocytes. there may be a number of explanations, for example, that tunel does not label meiotic dsbs efficiently, that leptotene oocytes are heterogeneous, that the number of dsbs at the leptotene stage is smaller than the number of 3'-ends in dna during apoptosis and thus dsbs in leptotene oocytes may be below the threshold for detection by tunel, or that the complexes of proteins that bind to meiotic dsbs have persisted despite proteinase k exposure and masked the sites. further experimentation would be necessary to clarify this point, including the use of antibodies specific to meiotic dsb processing proteins , rather than the non-specific tunel procedure.

when does oocyte apoptosis occur?
the proportion of p+t- oocytes remained very low throughout meiotic prophase i. this would be expected because cleaved parp- <dig> is present late in apoptosis shortly before dna breakdown, which would then be indicated by co-positivity for tunel. however, the observed p+t- oocytes in pachytene on  <dig> dpc and diplotene oocytes from  <dig> dpc may be precursors of the rise in p+t+ diplotene oocytes between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc . this tends to confirm the findings of pepling and spradling  <cit> , who showed increased female germ cell apoptosis in mice from  <dig>  to  <dig>  dpc.

the proportion of p-t+ oocytes in pachytene was low except on  <dig> dpc . p-t+ oocytes are either healthy, with physiological dna breaks due to meiotic chromosome activities  <cit>  or active rna synthesis  <cit>  or at very late stages of apoptosis, with migration of cleaved parp- <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  <cit>  and consumption of nad+ in the cytoplasm  <cit>  to replenish adp-ribose. since their elements are intact, and pachytene oocytes are increasing in number at this point, the latter seems unlikely. the nature of the tunel positivity in parp- <dig> negative pachytene oocytes could possibly relate to recombination activities at this time  <cit> , however, in that case, it is unclear why it affects only a proportion of pachytene oocytes.

previous studies have noted abnormal appearing pachytene oocytes using histological methods and have concluded that pachytene is a major point in meiosis at which oocyte elimination may occur  <cit>  as is the case in males  <cit> . however, this was challenged by mcclellan et al  <cit>  who used a combination of histological and spreading methods to show a continual loss of oocytes throughout meiotic prophase i. in our study, pachytene oocytes were no more likely than other stages of meiotic prophase to exhibit fragmented or compressed elements , or staining for apoptotic markers. our data therefore do not support the contention of stage-specific apoptosis in prenatal mouse oocytes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, fragmented axial elements, demonstrated by cor  <dig> staining, are not necessarily indicative of oocyte apoptosis, however, compressed elements in poorly-spread nuclei may be associated with apoptosis. approximately 10–50% of oocytes at all stages stained positive for cleaved parp- <dig>  an apoptosis marker. these conclusions have major implications for the interpretation of data arising from oocyte spreading techniques. in particular, our data pose a significant challenge to the currently widespread assumption that fragmented axial elements are evidence of oocyte degeneration. it is possible that such oocytes may be undergoing a cell death process unrelated to parp- <dig>  however, parp- <dig> dependent apoptosis is clearly a major contributory pathway for prenatal oocyte loss during meiotic prophase i because a major fraction of this oocyte population does stain for parp- <dig>  regardless of the appearance of axial elements. future research should address which other apoptotic pathways are involved, the upstream events leading to a cell death decision, and how they relate to the control and progress of meiotic prophase i.

our results also provide strong support for the work of others challenging the concept of stage-specific oocyte demise during meiotic prophase i. the proportions of p+t+ oocytes during zygotene on  <dig>  dpc, pachytene from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc and diplotene from  <dig> dpc onwards suggests that there are several stages throughout first meiotic prophase when apoptosis may occur. however, diplotene seems to be when the majority of oocytes are depleted via apoptosis, particularly at birth or shortly afterwards. some oocytes in zygotene and pachytene, which lack evidence of apoptosis, may persist for at least  <dig> days postnatally. genetic effects upon the rate of meiotic prophase i and the numbers of oocytes that will survive beyond the prenatal period are currently poorly understood, but may explain some of the discrepancies noted between our work and that of others.

prenatal apoptosis and events in meiotic prophase i are well known to impact upon many later aspects of oogenesis and fertility, and thus deserve thorough investigation. the present data add to the evidence detailing oocyte apoptosis throughout meiotic prophase i, providing much-needed information and challenging the validity of tunel for studies of apoptosis in oocytes.
