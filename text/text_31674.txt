BACKGROUND
antigen receptor genes are assembled by a process known as vj recombination from arrays of variable , diversity , and joining  gene segments that are flanked on one  or both  sides by a conserved recombination signal sequence   separated by either  <dig> or  <dig> base pairs  from a conserved nonamer element . the rss functions as the binding site for the rag <dig> and rag <dig> proteins, which together initiate vj recombination by cleaving the rss at the 5'-end of the heptamer through a two-step nick-hairpin mechanism. normally, recombination only occurs between two gene segments that differ in the spacer length of the flanking rss , a restriction termed the 12/ <dig> rule. however, studies of recurrent breakpoint sequences identified in some types of lymphoid malignancies suggest that the rag proteins may occasionally mediate illegitimate recombination by introducing a site-specific dna break at a sequences resembling an rss   <cit> , or catalyzing structure-specific cleavage at sites prone to adopting non-b form dna conformations  <cit> .

to be considered a plausible crss, it is generally thought that the putative crss must minimally contain at least the first three residues of the consensus heptamer   <cit>  due to the high degree of sequence conservation of these residues among bona fide rsss  <cit>  and based on functional studies of mutant rss substrates which demonstrate that mutation of any of these residues essentially abolishes rag-mediated cleavage  <cit>  and vj recombination  <cit> . the rag proteins also exhibit structure-specific nicking of dna, preferentially targeting transitions from single- to double-stranded dna  <cit> . nicks can lead to dna double strand breaks if they are introduced on both dna strands in close proximity. to study structure-specific nicking by the rag proteins, most studies have artificially introduced transitions from single- to double-stranded dna into dna substrates by incorporating bp mismatches, bulges, flaps, or gaps. only one example has been reported of an otherwise fully complementary double-stranded dna adopting a non-b form dna conformation that is targeted by the rag complex for nicking  <cit> . whether cellular factors can help stabilize alternative dna conformations in otherwise complementary dna which can then be targeted for rag-mediated cleavage remains unclear.

in principle, high mobility group proteins that belong to the hmg-box family of architectural dna binding and bending factors  are plausible candidates for promoting mistargeted rag activity because they are capable of binding structurally distorted dna  <cit> , such as four-way junctions  <cit>  and damaged or modified dna  <cit> , and also can interact directly with the rag proteins  <cit>  and stimulate rag-mediated rss binding and cleavage activity in vitro  <cit>  and vj recombination in cell culture assays  <cit> . in support of this possibility, we have identified a novel dna breakpoint site in the plasmid vj recombination substrate pgg <dig>  that is cleaved by the rag proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism in the presence of hmgb1/ <dig>  we find that rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage yields a blunt end with the sequence 5'-cctgacg-3' that is separated by 23-bps from a nonamer-like element . rag cleavage activity at bps <dig> is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss, and requires both hmg-box domains of hmgb <dig> to be intact. evidence is presented that hmgb1/ <dig> targets a dyad-symmetric inverted repeat sequence lying 5' of the cleavage site. the implications of these findings are discussed.

RESULTS
identification of a novel rag-mediated breakpoint sequence, bps <dig>  in pgg <dig> that lacks an obvious heptamer
in a previous study, raghavan and lieber characterized the vj recombination potential of several putative crsss identified from lymphoid malignancies, including ttg- <dig> and hox <dig>  <cit> . to assay ttg- <dig> and hox <dig> recombination activity, the plasmid recombination substrate pgg <dig>  which contains a consensus 12-rss and a 23-rss in a deletional configuration, was modified to replace the 23-rss with ttg- <dig> and hox <dig> sequences . to follow up that study, we recently investigated in vitro rag-mediated cleavage of these plasmid substrates, using ligation-mediated pcr  to detect blunt signal end breaks  at the 23-rss or the crss  <cit>  . consistent with previous results, we find that sebs are readily detected in plasmid substrates containing a consensus 23-rss when incubated with wild-type but not catalytically inactive rag proteins  in the presence of hmgb <dig>  but the abundance of these breaks diminishes when the 23-rss is replaced by the ttg- <dig> sequence, and is reduced even further upon replacement with the hox <dig> sequence . however, as cleavage at the crss diminishes, cleavage at an alternative site increases . cloning and sequencing of the major lm-pcr product revealed a recurrent breakpoint at position  <dig>  of the plasmid substrate. interestingly, this sequence lacks an obvious heptamer motif next to the breakpoint , but contains a plausible nonamer-like element  <dig> nucleotides from the cleavage site , similar to a 23-rss . we also noticed the presence of a seven bp dyad-symmetric inverted repeat sequence 5' of the breakpoint, overlapping the cleavage site by one bp at the 3' end. because the sequence 3' to the breakpoint lacks consensus residues at positions equivalent to the second and third bps of the consensus heptamer, which previous studies have shown are necessary to support efficient rag-mediated rss cleavage  <cit>  and vj recombination  <cit> , we wondered whether this site is cleaved by the rag proteins through a standard nick-hairpin mechanism, and questioned whether the flanking inverted repeat element rather than the heptamer sequence might play a key role in guiding rag-mediated cleavage at this site. to answer this question, we pursued further biochemical analysis of rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage.

rag-mediated cleavage of bps <dig> occurs through a nick-hairpin mechanism and is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss
to examine the bps <dig> cleavage mechanism in more detail, we used pcr to prepare ~ <dig> bp top strand radiolabeled dna substrates from wild-type pgg <dig> and its derivatives containing ttg- <dig> or hox <dig> in place of the 23-rss . to determine whether these substrates are cleaved by the rag proteins in vitro, we incubated the dna fragments with wt or d600a cmr1/cmr <dig> and hmgb <dig> and separated the reaction products on a native agarose gel . as expected, rag-mediated cleavage of the 6197/12/ <dig> substrate yielded a major product of ~ <dig> bp  consistent with cleavage at the 12-rss, and minor products of ~ <dig> bp and ~ <dig> bp  expected from cleavage at the 23-rss  and bps <dig>  respectively. consistent with results obtained by lm-pcr, replacement of the 23-rss with ttg- <dig> or hox <dig> sequences results in diminished in vitro cleavage at the crss, and a concomitant increase in bps <dig> cleavage .

to follow up this experiment, we incubated the substrates with wt or d600a cmr1/cmr <dig> in the absence or presence of hmgb <dig> and analyzed the reaction products on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel in parallel with native gel-isolated cleavage products a and b as well as sizing markers derived from restriction endonuclease cleavage of the intact bps6197/12/ <dig> substrate . we find that cleavage product b migrates more slowly than a  <dig> nt fragment generated by sali digestion of the intact bps6197/12/ <dig> substrate, and comigrates with the major reaction product generated by rag-mediated cleavage . in contrast, cleavage product a migrates just moderately faster than the sali cleavage product, but much more slowly than a  <dig> nt product generated by aatii digestion , and is only observed in the in vitro cleavage reactions containing wt cmr1/cmr <dig> and hmgb <dig> . moreover, the abundance of this product increases when the 23-rss is replaced by ttg- <dig> or hox <dig> sequences, and this increase is correlated with reduced nicking at these crsss . faster migrating reaction products are also detected that correspond to nicks introduced at positions  <dig> and  <dig> , with the latter product being more abundant than the former. the apparent doubling in the size of product a between native and denaturing gels and the detection of nicks at bps <dig> provide compelling evidence that bps <dig> supports rag-mediated cleavage by a nick-hairpin mechanism.

the relationship between the level of nicking observed at the 23-rss/crss and bps <dig> cleavage activity suggested that the removing the 23-rss itself may be sufficient to promote bps <dig> cleavage. to test this possibility, and the role of the 12-rss in supporting bps <dig> cleavage activity, mutant substrates were prepared that lacked one or both rsss  and then these substrates were subjected to in vitro cleavage by wt or d600a cmr1/cmr <dig> in the absence or presence of hmgb <dig> . we find that substrates lacking the 12-rss support lower levels of bps <dig> hairpin formation than their counterparts containing a 12-rss , but removal of the 23-rss enhanced bps <dig> cleavage relative to the 6197/12/ <dig> substrate, with substrate cleavage levels similar to that observed with the 6197/12/hox <dig> substrate . in contrast, when both the 12- and 23-rss were absent, bps <dig> was cleaved poorly . taken together, these data strongly suggest that bps <dig> cleavage is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss partner. to determine whether the distance or orientation of the 12-rss partner positioned in cis influences the efficiency of rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage, we removed the proximal 12-rss and replaced the distal 23-rss with a 12-rss in either orientation. we find that the level of rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage of these substrates in vitro is quite similar to that observed with the 6197/ <dig> substrate , suggesting that rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage is not affected by the distance or orientation of the 12-rss partner.

analysis of rag-mediated cleavage and binding of bps <dig> using oligonucleotide substrates
we were interested in determining whether stimulation of bps <dig> cleavage by a 12-rss paired in cis can be reconstituted in trans using oligonucleotide substrates. to test this possibility, we prepared  <dig> bp radiolabeled oligonucleotide substrates containing a consensus 23-rss or the bps <dig> sequence and incubated them with wt cmr1/cmr <dig> in reaction buffer containing mg2+ in the absence or presence of hmgb <dig> and/or cold 12-rss or 23-rss partner . as expected from our previous studies  <cit> , the 23-rss substrate is nicked robustly by the rag proteins under these conditions, with some hairpin formation and aberrant nicking in the spacer also detected. both appropriate and aberrant nicking is suppressed when only cold partner rss is added or when hmgb <dig> is present . however, addition of both hmgb <dig> and cold 12-rss partner stimulates rag-mediated 23-rss cleavage , but cold 23-rss diminishes the level of cleavage observed . in contrast to the 23-rss, rag-mediated bps <dig> nicking is modestly stimulated  in the presence of hmgb <dig> . however, like the 23-rss, addition of hmgb <dig> and cold 12-rss, but not 23-rss, promotes rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage, although the amount of hairpin produced is ~20–25-fold lower than that observed for the consensus 23-rss . these data support the conclusion that bps <dig> functionally resembles a 23-rss.

in principle, the lower cleavage activity observed with bps <dig> relative to a consensus 23-rss could reflect poorer rag binding to this substrate. to test this possibility, we compared the rag binding activity between the consensus 23-rss and bps <dig> substrates using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay . in the first experiment, radiolabeled substrates were incubated with wt cmr1/cmr <dig> alone or with hmgb <dig> in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of cold 23-rss as a specific competitor . in the absence of hmgb <dig>  wt cmr1/cmr <dig> assembles two discrete protein-dna complexes with a consensus 23-rss. we have previously shown that these rag-rss complexes, called sc <dig> and sc <dig>  both contain a rag <dig> dimer and either one  or two  molecules of rag <dig>  <cit> . both complexes are supershifted by the addition of hmgb <dig>  and the abundance of these complexes is diminished by further addition of increasing amounts of cold 23-rss competitor. we find that the rag proteins assemble the various protein-dna complexes on the bps <dig> substrate similarly to a consensus 23-rss, with protein-dna complex formation only slightly more susceptible to competition by a cold 23-rss. to confirm these results, we assembled rag complexes on a radiolabeled 23-rss substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations of cold 23-rss, bps <dig>  hox <dig> or non-specific competitor dna . we find that, as competitors, the substrates can be ordered from strongest to weakest as follows: 23-rss>bps6197>hox11>non-specific dna, with differences between each being approximately 2– <dig> fold. together, these data suggest that bps <dig> is competent to support stable formation of rag-dna complexes in vitro to levels that are close  to a consensus 23-rss.

site-specific bps <dig> cleavage is directed by inverted repeat and nonamer-like sequences
to directly test the sequence requirements for rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage, we generated two mutant bps <dig> substrates. in the first, the 5' end of the inverted repeat sequence was mutated  to determine whether this sequence influences where the rag proteins cleave the substrate. if the location of bps <dig> cleavage is directed solely by specific recognition of residues at positions equivalent to the heptamer, then one might expect mutating residues 4– <dig> nucleotides distal to the cleavage site in the coding flank would not appreciably alter where the rag proteins cleave the substrate. interestingly, however, we find that mutation of these residues shifts the preferred cleavage site by two nucleotides, so that a cac trinucleotide sequence , which is also found in a consensus heptamer, is preferentially nicked compared to the cct trinucleotide sequence  targeted in the wild-type bps <dig> substrate . this observation also holds true if the substrates lack the 23-rss . these data suggest that the coding flank sequence in bps <dig> plays a larger role in directing the site of cleavage than in a consensus rss, where residues in the heptamer play a predominant role in guiding the position of rag-mediated cleavage  <cit> . to determine whether the nonamer-like sequence identified in bps <dig> is required to support bps <dig> cleavage, we mutated the putative nonamer motif  and analyzed reaction products generated after rag-mediated cleavage of this substrate. we find that mutating this element largely abolishes nicking and hairpin formation at bps <dig>  regardless of whether the consensus 23-rss paired in cis is present or absent in these substrates .

having established a functional role for the inverted repeat and nonamer-like sequences in supporting rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage on pcr-generated substrates, we wished to determine whether the effects of substrate mutations on rag-mediated cleavage of long dna fragments can be recapitulated using short oligonucleotide substrates, and to evaluate the degree to which substrate mutations impaired rag-dna complex formation. in general, we find that mutations in the inverted repeat and nonamer-like sequences show comparable effects on the reaction product profile after rag-mediated cleavage as their counterpart long dna fragments, except that there is less dependence on the presence of hmgb <dig> for the introduction of nicks in the bps <dig> sequence . specifically, mutations in the inverted repeat were found to skew the pattern of reactivity in favour of cleavage two nucleotides into the coding flank, with hairpins derived from both nicks being clearly evident in the presence of hmgb <dig> and cold 12-rss partner . in contrast, mutations in the nonamer-like sequence greatly reduce substrate cleavage activity under the same conditions . to examine whether the flanking sequence itself is required to direct rag-mediated cleavage, we also tested a mutant oligonucleotide substrate in which the sequence flanking bps <dig> is replaced by the coding flank of the consensus 23-rss. interestingly, this sequence shows no evidence of rag-mediated nicking in the coding flank, but supports levels of nicking and hairpin formation at the predicted heptamer-coding junction that are modestly lower than the wild-type bps <dig> substrate . the differential cleavage of substrates bearing mutations in the coding flank are not attributed to differences in how these substrates are bound by the rag proteins, because the abundance and distribution of rag-dna complexes assembled on these substrates is quite similar to those formed using a consensus 23-rss substrate, as assessed by emsa . however, mutation of the nonamer-like sequence clearly impairs rag-dna complex formation. taken together, these data suggest that the coding sequence of bps <dig> plays an important role in directing the site of rag-mediated cleavage and that the nonamer-like element functions to stabilize rag binding to this dna sequence.

determinants of hmgb <dig> required to promote rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage
the dependence of rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage in long dna fragments on hmgb <dig> led us to question what determinants of hmgb <dig> were required to support this activity. hmgb <dig> and its vertebrate homologue hmgb <dig>  contain tandem hmgb-box domains  and an acidic c-terminal tail separated from the hmg-boxes by a linker sequence rich in basic residues  <cit> . both hmg-box domains share a globally similar architecture comprised of three alpha helices that adopt an l-shaped structure. both domains possess dna binding activity, primarily interacting with the minor groove and mediating dna bending in part by intercalating hydrophobic residues between dna bps. despite this similarity, the two domains exhibit distinct dna binding preferences: box a selectively binds distorted dna structures, whereas box b shows less preference for such structures but, unlike box a, can itself induce a severe bend in linear dna. the functional activity of the hmg-box domains is further modulated in various ways by the c-terminal basic and acidic residues.

given the distinct functional properties of the different regions of hmgb <dig>  we sought to examine their roles in stimulating rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage. in a previous study to identify determinants of hmgb <dig> required to stimulate rag-mediated cleavage of an oligonucleotide substrate containing a consensus 23-rss, we prepared a large panel of truncated wild-type and mutant forms of hmgb <dig>  <cit> . we evaluated this panel of hmgb <dig> proteins, as well as a truncated form of wild-type hmgb <dig>  for their ability to promote rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage in long dna fragments amplified from pgg <dig> or its derivative lacking the 23-rss . we find that, compared to full-length wild-type hmgb <dig>  individual hmg-box domains and forms of hmgb <dig> containing mutations in one or both hmg-boxes that target residues involved in mediating key protein-dna interactions show severe defects in stimulating rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage, regardless of whether or not a partner consensus 23-rss is present in the substrate in cis. interestingly, except for box b', these proteins remain capable of stimulating 12-rss cleavage in these substrates relative to samples containing cmr1/cmr <dig> alone. this outcome is consistent with our recent data showing that despite failing to stimulate rag-mediated cleavage on an isolated 23-rss oligonucleotide substrate in mg2+, a single hmg-box domain can promote 23-rss cleavage when a partner 12-rss is present  <cit> . in this study, either the 23-rss or bps <dig> may serve in cis as the partner to the 12-rss in the long dna substrate. for the latter case, these data argue that bps <dig> need not necessarily undergo nicking to stimulate 12-rss cleavage. consistent with previous studies  <cit> , forms of hmgb <dig> lacking the acidic tail promote greater nicking and comparable to slightly higher levels of rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage than full-length hmgb <dig>  interestingly, however, rearranging the order of hmg-boxes  does not diminish the level of rag-mediated bps <dig> nicking, but does slightly impair hairpin formation at this site. this effect is also observed at the 12-rss, suggesting that the two domains do not have entirely redundant functions in facilitating hairpin formation at rsss positioned in cis. finally, the ability of tandem hmg-box domains to stimulate rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage is not unique to hmgb <dig>  as a tailless form of hmgb <dig> also promotes cleavage at levels comparable to hmgb <dig> 

bps <dig> supports enhanced binding by hmgb <dig> compared to a 23-rss
the strong dependence of rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage on hmgb <dig> raises the possibility that hmgb <dig> selectively targets this sequence, and facilitates formation of a stable protein-dna complex with the rag proteins. if so, hmgb <dig> might be expected to bind bps <dig> better than a consensus 23-rss. to test this possibility, we incubated oligonucleotide substrates containing a consensus 23-rss or bsp <dig> with increasing amounts of wild-type full-length or tailless forms of hmgb <dig> and analyzed protein-dna complex formation by emsa . we find that both forms of hmgb <dig> require about  <dig> -fold less protein to form comparable levels of protein-dna complexes on bps <dig> compared to the 23-rss, suggesting that hmgb <dig> preferentially binds bps <dig> relative to the 23-rss.

cleavage and recombination activity of bps <dig> in cells
since in vitro studies clearly establish that bps <dig> is a target for rag-mediated cleavage in the presence of hmgb <dig>  we wondered whether this site supports vj recombination in cells. to examine this possibility, we generated plasmid vj recombination substrates, derived from pjh <dig>  containing a 12-rss and either a consensus 23-rss in the same orientation as the 12-rss  or bps <dig> in the same or reverse orientation relative to the 12-rss  . the pjh <dig> backbone was used instead of pgg <dig> in this case due to concerns about removing the bps <dig> sequence from its native context in the lac promoter 5' of the 12-rss. we first wished to test whether bps <dig> is a target for rag-mediated cleavage in the context of pjh <dig> in vitro. we find that, consistent with results in figure  <dig>  bps <dig> sebs are detected by lm-pcr in 12/6197so plasmid dna recovered after in vitro cleavage by wt, but not d600a cmr1/cmr2; sebs at this site increase when hmgb <dig> is also present in the cleavage reaction . sebs are not detected when bps <dig> is in the opposite orientation , as expected if rag-mediated cleavage yields a covalently sealed coding end proximal to the 23p primer that cannot be ligated to linker dna . cleavage at the 12-rss is also detected in these assays, and increases when the 23-rss is replaced by bps <dig> 

having established that the rag proteins can cleave bps <dig> when embedded in the pjh <dig> backbone, we next cotransfected these substrates with wt or d600a cmr <dig> and wt cmr <dig> expression constructs in  <dig> cells and analyzed plasmid dna recovered  <dig> h after transfection for bps <dig> and/or rss sebs. we find that sebs at both rsss are readily detected in the recovered 12/ <dig> substrate cotransfected with wt cmr1/cmr <dig>  but not d600a cmr1/cmr <dig> . however, in contrast to in vitro cleavage assays, bsp <dig> sebs are not observed in the 12/6197so plasmid dna recovered from cell culture, despite detecting cleavage at the 12-rss positioned in cis . we considered the possibility that hmgb <dig> expression may be insufficient in  <dig> cells to promote rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage. however, hmgb <dig> is readily detected in  <dig> cell lysates and repeating these assays in  <dig> cell lines overexpressing hmgb <dig> did not change the outcome of the experiment . therefore, we conclude that bps <dig> is not cleaved by the rag proteins in cells to levels that are within the detection limit of our lm-pcr assay. we consider possible explanations for this result below.

discussion
here we describe the identification of a novel breakpoint sequence in pgg <dig> called bsp <dig> that is targeted for rag-mediated cleavage in vitro in the presence of hmgb <dig>  because the sequence lacks an obvious heptamer motif and possesses an inverted repeat in the sequence flanking the breakpoint, we were curious about the mechanism underlying the cleavage reaction and considered the possibility that rag-mediated cleavage is directed by the inverted repeat. we show here that bps <dig> supports rag-mediated cleavage via a nick-hairpin mechanism. efficient rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage depends on the presence of hmgb <dig> and synapsis with a partner 12-rss, and is guided in part by the inverted repeat sequence. to our knowledge, this is the first example of a flanking inverted repeat sequence influencing where the rag proteins initiate dna cleavage.

given the dependence of rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage on synapsis with a 12-rss, we might have expected to detect lm-pcr products resulting from linker ligation to sebs at both bps <dig> and the 12-rss, using the linker primer as both a forward and reverse primer. the predicted size of this lm-pcr product is  <dig> bp, which is  <dig> bp longer than the lm-pcr product that identifies the 23-rss seb using the linker primer and the primer downstream of the 23-rss . close inspection of figure 1b does show the presence of low levels of lm-pcr products running slightly larger than those detecting the 23rss seb that are consistent with the introduction of sebs at both the 12-rss and bps <dig>  their abundance may be less than one might expect for several possible reasons, including a lower probability of linker ligation at both sebs, amplification from substrates containing bps <dig> sebs associated with a nicked 12-rss , and/or competition with pcr products amplified using the linker primer and 23p primer.

in our previous study, we found that rag-mediated nicking and cleavage of oligonucleotide substrates containing crsss identified from lymphoid malignancies were either unchanged or slightly reduced in the presence of hmgb <dig> for most crsss tested , except ttg- <dig>  <cit> . in the latter case, nicks at the predicted heptamer  was not enhanced by addition of hmgb <dig>  but nicks at other locations in the ttg- <dig> sequence increased when hmgb <dig> was added to the cleavage reaction. in contrast, rag-mediated nicking of a bps <dig> oligonucleotide substrate increases with addition of hmgb <dig>  and efficient nicking and hairpin formation at this site in long dna is hmgb1-dependent.

one possible reason why rag-mediated bps <dig> cleavage shows a more stringent requirement for hmgb <dig> than other crsss examined previously is that hmgb <dig> may target and/or stabilize a structural distortion in the flanking inverted repeat sequence. this possibility is made plausible by previous studies showing that hmgb <dig> binds four-way junctions  <cit>  and is further supported by evidence presented here that hmgb <dig> binds bps <dig> better than a consensus 23-rss. however, attempts to detect a stable pre-existing or protein-induced four-way junction in the inverted repeat of bps <dig> using dna footprinting experiments failed to yield compelling evidence for the existence of such a structure , but we point out that this may be difficult to detect due to its small size, or if the structure is transient, limited in abundance, or masked in the bound complex. similarly, although the lack of detectable bps <dig> cleavage in cell culture experiments could be interpreted to mean that the rag proteins fail to recognize this sequence in vivo, it is possible that factors bound to the plasmid substrate in cells render the site inaccessible to the rag and/or hmgb1/ <dig> proteins or unable to adopt a conformation that is targeted by hmgb1/ <dig> 

although authentic rsss in antigen receptor loci are the normal targets of the rag proteins during vj recombination, illegitimate rag activity has been implicated in the etiology of chromosomal abnormalities recurrent in certain forms of leukemia and lymphoma  <cit> . a subset of these events have been attributed to the rag proteins mistargeting a sequence resembling an rss, and mediating a standard vj-type rearrangement between an authentic rss and a crss. in cases where there is clear evidence for this type of rearrangement, the crss contains at least the first three residues of the consensus heptamer . a second subset of events has been suggested to occur through the illegitimate repair of a mechanistically undefined dna double strand break with dna ends produced by rag-mediated cleavage at a pair of authentic rsss. the source of the undefined dna break in the second type of recombination event is unclear as these sites generally do not have a recognizable crss with a plausible heptamer motif. the data presented here raise the possibility that such sites, despite lacking an obvious heptamer, could nevertheless be subjected to illegitimate rag-mediated cleavage if they contain a nonamer-like sequence that could anchor the rag complex in proximity to the breakpoint. by recognizing or stabilizing a structural distortion at the breakpoint, hmgb1/ <dig> may then promote illegitimate dna cleavage by targeting the anchored rag complex to the breakpoint in lieu of a consensus heptamer. it is likely that stable hmgb1/ <dig> association with the breakpoint depends on concomitant interactions with the rag proteins themselves, most likely rag <dig>  <cit> , as hmgb <dig> alone, despite displaying some sequence preference for bps <dig> over the 23-rss, nevertheless binds this site relatively weakly . this targeting mechanism need not be unique to hmgb1/ <dig>  as it could also be facilitated directly or indirectly by transcription factors that bind in or near the breakpoint sequence and interact with the rag proteins as an illegitimate form of an otherwise normal process  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have uncovered an example of illegitimate dna cleavage by the rag proteins at a dna sequence called bps <dig> that lacks an apparent heptamer motif. we demonstrate that bps <dig> functionally resembles a 23-rss and that rag-mediated cleavage at this site:  occurs through a nick-hairpin mechanism;  depends on the presence of hmgb1/2;  is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss; and  is partly directed by an inverted repeat sequence 5' of the breakpoint. we provide evidence that hmgb <dig> alone binds bps <dig> better than a 23-rss, and that efficient rag-mediated cleavage of this site requires both hmg-box domains to be intact. taken together, these data suggest that hmgb1/ <dig> can target illegitimate rag-mediated cleavage at sequences lacking an evident heptamer. these results raise the possibility that breakpoint sequences identified in lymphoid malignancies that were previously thought unlikely to undergo rag-mediated cleavage due to the absence of a crss with a heptamer-like sequence may nevertheless support cleavage by the rag proteins in the presence of cofactors like hmgb1/ <dig>
