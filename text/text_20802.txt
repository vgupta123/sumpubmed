BACKGROUND
several vertebrate species have the capacity to transdifferentiate the retinal pigmented epithelium  to retina . in the chick, the process of rpe transdifferentiation was first described based on histological observations
 <cit> . we previously demonstrated that after retina removal from chick eyes at embryonic day   <dig> to  <dig>   and in the presence of fibroblast growth factor  <dig> , the rpe loses its pigmentation and transdifferentiates to become a neuroepithelium, co-expressing the retinal progenitor markers pax <dig> and chx <dig> through fgf/fgf-receptor /mitogen-activated protein kinase  and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase  signaling cascade
 <cit> . concomitantly with rpe transdifferentiation, the transcriptional factor mitf, an rpe-specific marker, is down-regulated, suggesting a change in cell fate of the injured rpe. the ectopic expression of mitf is sufficient to inhibit rpe transdifferentiation, likely inhibiting the up-regulation of pax <dig> expression
 <cit> . during retina regeneration from the rpe, the newly generated neuroepithelium eventually differentiates into all major cell types found in the retina, and the differentiation pattern follows the same order as it does during normal development
 <cit> . the ability of rpe cells to transdifferentiate ceases as embryonic development proceeds beyond e <dig> 
 <cit> . however, the ectopic expression of pax <dig> is sufficient to induce rpe transdifferentiation in the intact developing chick eye up to e <dig> 
 <cit> . in chick rpe cultures, overexpression of different pro-neural transcriptional factors such as sox <dig>  ash <dig>  ath <dig>  neurod, neurogenin <dig>  neurogenin <dig>  cath <dig> and msx <dig> can promote the transdifferentiation of the rpe into neuronal cells . by contrast, there are several factors associated with rpe specification, including mitf, otx <dig>  wnt <dig>  bmp, shh and activin
 <cit> . the inactivation of wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the embryonic mouse rpe results in down-regulation of rpe-specific factors mitf and otx <dig> and expression of neural retina markers chx <dig> and rx
 <cit> .

recently, it has been demonstrated that somatic mammalian cells can be reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells by ectopic expression of pluripotency-inducing factors oct <dig>  sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> as well as by the combination of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog and the rna-binding protein lin-28
 <cit> . among all these transcriptional factors, oct <dig> , nanog and sox <dig> are key factors that maintain embryonic stem cell identity
 <cit> . more recently, efficient differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into neural retina cells has been demonstrated, suggesting the possibility of using these cells for clinical therapies
 <cit> . other studies have used a specific set of factors to convert fibroblasts directly into induced neural cells
 <cit> . for example, mouse fibroblasts can be directly converted into induced neural cells by overexpressing ascl <dig>  brn <dig> and myt1l. however, these induced cells lack the potential to generate diverse neural subtypes
 <cit> . in another work, transient expression of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> was sufficient to induce transdifferentiation of mouse fibroblasts to neural stem/progenitors cells
 <cit>  that can be expanded and differentiate in multiple neuronal subtypes and glial cells. although all these methods of reprogramming yield cells with similar characteristics to the target cells, it is still unknown if these reprogrammed cells are able to recapitulate the natural process of differentiation or whether the induced pluripotent stem cells or induced neural cells retain the epigenetic memory of their origin. importantly, aberrant expression of pluripotency genes, incomplete demethylation of specific promoters, viral integration and, more prominently, cancer
 <cit>  have been reported as a result of reprogramming. moreover, from the medical point of view, the possibility to integrate these cells into somatic tissue remains unclear.

as an alternative, the study of transdifferentiation and regeneration could provide important information regarding maintenance of pluripotency, dedifferentiation processes, factors involved in cell reprogramming and integration of the cells in the regenerated tissue
 <cit> . initial studies have shown that among the pluripotency-inducing factors, sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> are the common factors expressed during lens and limb regeneration in newts and during fin regeneration and müller glia dedifferentiation in zebrafish
 <cit> . more recently, it was demonstrated that in mammals lin- <dig> can enhance tissue repair in several contexts including improved hair regrowth and accelerated regrowth of cartilage, bone and mesenchyme after ear and digit injuries
 <cit> .

lin- <dig> is an important regulator of let- <dig> mirnas, and it has a functional role in organismal growth and metabolism, tissue development, somatic reprogramming and cancer . during in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic carcinoma cells to neural and glial fates, lin- <dig> can alter the cell fate independently of let-7; in addition, overexpression of lin- <dig> increases neurogenesis in the same cell types
 <cit> . in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that lin- <dig> regulates the translation and stability of a large number of mrnas including cell cycle regulators, splicing factors, metabolic enzymes and rna-binding proteins
 <cit> . all this evidence strongly suggests that lin- <dig> can have a pivotal role in tissue regeneration.

consistent with this idea, we analyzed the expression of pluripotency-inducing factors, including lin- <dig>  during rpe transdifferentiation, using the embryonic chick model of retina regeneration. among all the factors, sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> were transiently up-regulated in the injured rpe  along with eye field transcriptional factors, achaete-scute complex homolog  <dig> ) and differential up-regulation of alterative splice variants of pax <dig>  by contrast, lin- <dig> was significantly up-regulated only in the presence of fgf <dig> in retinectomized eyes. moreover, lin- <dig> overexpression in the injured rpe was sufficient to induce rpe transdifferentiation.

these results establish a two-step dedifferentiation process. first, upon injury there is an activation of gene expression for sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig>  concomitantly with the up-regulation of eye field transcriptional factors. second, in the presence of fgf <dig>  lin- <dig> is up-regulated, suggesting a correlation between the expression of lin- <dig> and the process of transdifferentiation. overexpression of lin- <dig> in the injured rpe was sufficient to induce rpe transdifferentiation in the absence of an external source of growth factors. to our knowledge, these data provide the first evidence that lin- <dig> plays an important role in retina regeneration via rpe transdifferentiation. this is also the first detailed study on the molecular profile of the rpe during the process of dedifferentiation.

RESULTS
expression of pluripotency-inducing factors in the ciliary margin and retinal pigmented epithelium
to dissect the possible role of pluripotency-inducing factors during rpe transdifferentiation, we decided first to analyze the expression of these factors in e <dig> eyes . the presence of transcripts was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  from rna collected from the ciliary margin or rpe. in order to keep the integrity and specificity of all the tissues collected, we used laser capture microdissection. we found that sox <dig>  c-myc, klf <dig> and lin- <dig> mrnas were expressed in the ciliary margin, while only klf <dig>  c-myc and lin- <dig> were detected in the rpe . consistent with the rt-pcr analysis, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that sox <dig>  c-myc, klf <dig> and lin- <dig> were present in both the ciliary margin and neuroepithelium . by contrast, only klf <dig>  c-myc and lin- <dig> were present in the rpe at e <dig> and e <dig> . in agreement with our results, sox <dig> has been reported to be expressed in the presumptive neural retina and is down-regulated in the presumptive rpe at e <dig> to  <dig>  
 <cit> .

among these factors, it has been reported that klf <dig> plays a critical role in neurogenesis and neural migration during cerebral cortex development in mouse
 <cit> . it could be possible that klf <dig> has a similar role in retina development. in chick embryos, klf <dig> mrna was detected in the neural folds and in the neural tube at stages  <dig> to  <dig>  later, at stage  <dig>  klf <dig> was detected in the face and neck region
 <cit> . in our experiments, we detected klf <dig> ubiquitously in the ciliary margin, neuroepithelium and rpe .

in chicken embryos, lin- <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in the presumptive limb primordium at stages  <dig> to  <dig>  and in other tissues including the neuroepithelium of the optic cup and in the otic vesicle at e <dig>  to  <dig> 
 <cit> . in mouse, lin- <dig> is present in the retina at embryonic days e <dig>  to e <dig> 
 <cit> . we detected lin- <dig> in the chick ciliary margin, rpe and neuroepithelium at e <dig>   and at e <dig> , suggesting that the presence of this protein could be necessary for growth and differentiation of these tissues.

among all the factors controlling the regulatory network in embryonic stem cells, oct <dig> and nanog are considered the ‘key partner core’ of transcriptional regulators . expression of the avian homologs of oct <dig>  and nanog was demonstrated early in the developing chick at stages  <dig> to 9
 <cit> . we were unable to detect mrnas of oct <dig> and nanog in the ciliary margin or rpe at the embryonic days analyzed, but we did confirm their expression in chick embryos at stages  <dig> to  <dig> . although we found the expression of sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> in the ciliary margin, the absence of oct <dig> and nanog points out that these cells are not pluripotent but may retain some properties of stem cells. despite the fact that sox <dig>  c-myc, klf <dig> and lin- <dig> are considered pluripotency-inducing factors when used for reprograming in combination with oct <dig> and nanog, these factors have other functions during eye and retina development
 <cit> .

in the injured eye, the retinal pigmented epithelium dedifferentiates before entering the cell cycle and expresses sox <dig>  c-myc and klf4
it is known from several organisms, that transdifferentiation occurs by the following steps: transient dedifferentiation, proliferation and differentiation into the new linage
 <cit> . however, the time of dedifferentiation and proliferation is highly dependent on the type of damage and model of regeneration. for example, in zebrafish retina, different damage paradigms including light lesions , chemical treatments that kill retina neurons  and mechanical insults to the retina  ultimately result in regeneration of the lost neurons by müller glia transdifferentiation; however, the time at which müller glia dedifferentiate or enter the cell cycle varies between the treatments. dedifferentiation events have been reported as early as 4 h for the acute light lesion model, about 15 h for the stabbing model and up to 31 h for chronic light lesion cases. signs of cells entering the cell cycle have been observed  <dig> to 72 h post lesion  2 days after lentectomy. this is followed by the loss of pigmentation and cell identity, facilitating the subsequent proliferation that takes place 4 days later
 <cit> . notably, inhibiting the cell cycle using a cdk <dig> inhibitor does not block the process of dedifferentiation
 <cit> .

to better understand and characterize the process of rpe transdifferentiation, we analyzed the proliferative status of the rpe. we performed complete retinectomies in e <dig>  chick eyes in the presence or absence of fgf <dig>  and the embryos were collected at  <dig> and 24 hours post-retinectomy  to examine 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine  incorporation and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b  for cell cycle arrest. at 6 h pr, in the absence  or presence of fgf <dig>  we did not observe brdu-positive cells in the posterior rpe . by contrast, a large proportion of p27kip1-positive cells were found in the posterior rpe at 6 h pr regardless of the presence of fgf <dig> , suggesting that at this time point the cells were still arrested in the cell cycle and as a consequence proliferation was blocked. however, brdu-positive cells were detected in the rpe at 24 h pr only in the presence of fgf <dig> , when the rpe became p27kip1-negative , suggesting that rpe cells had entered the cell cycle. we did not observed brdu-positive cells in the rpe at 24 h pr in the absence of fgf <dig>  when the rpe was still p27kip1-positive ; therefore, fgf <dig> is necessary for the cell cycle entry, and eventually for rpe transdifferentiation
 <cit> .

to analyze the process of dedifferentiation, we wondered if injury  was sufficient to initiate changes in gene expression of pluripotency-inducing factors, genes associated with the rpe specification, and genes associated with retina progenitors, as well as eye field transcriptional factors. we used the following time points of analysis as a reference, 6 h pr , 24 h pr  and 72 h pr . mrna levels for all different genes were evaluated by quantitative rt-pcr  using rpe samples collected by laser capture microdissection. surprisingly, at 6 h pr, we observed activation of gene expression of sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> and over the basal levels detected in uninjured eyes. however, the expression of sox <dig> decreased by 72 h pr to the basal levels  . although the injury was sufficient to up-regulate sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> , which are present in retina progenitors , the absence of the transcripts for oct <dig> and nanog that are present in embryonic stem cells suggest that the rpe cells do not become pluripotent, but do acquire some plasticity. in agreement with our results, in vitro culture of rpe cells, isolated from adult human donor eyes, showed high levels of c-myc and klf <dig> compared to human embryonic stem cells, however, oct <dig> and nanog were not detected by immunostaining or rt-qpcr
 <cit> . among all the pluripotency-inducing factors, c-myc, klf <dig> and sox <dig> are the common factors expressed in regenerating tissues
 <cit> . it is of note that we did not detect expression of oct <dig> in the rpe before or after injury. interestingly, in zebrafish, klf <dig> and oct <dig> are expressed in the uninjured retina and transiently increase during the process of müller glia dedifferentiation
 <cit> . also in zebrafish, the knockdown of morpholino against pou5f <dig>  impairs fin regeneration, suggesting that oct <dig> might be crucial for regeneration in this organism
 <cit> .

the process of rpe dedifferentiation was evidenced by the down-regulation of rpe specification genes mitf and tyr  concomitantly with an up-regulation of neural retina progenitors ascl <dig>  and chx <dig>  .

we also decided to analyze if the dedifferentiated rpe cells go back into the lineage of eye formation. different factors are crucial for eye formation; the most important are the eye field transcriptional factors that are expressed in the anterior neural plate in the region specified to become the eyes. these eye field transcriptional factors include et, rx <dig>  six <dig>  pax <dig>  lhx <dig>  six <dig>  and tll <cit> . the up-regulation of rx <dig>  six <dig>  lhx <dig> and six <dig>  suggests that the injury was enough to induce a transient dedifferentiation of the rpe and promote these cells to go back to the presumptive optic vesicle stage.

despite the partial dedifferentiation of the rpe cells, by 72 h in the absence of fgf <dig> the rpe again acquired its pigmentation  and mitf expression was recovered at higher levels compared with the uninjured eye  . similar to what has been observed in müller glia transdifferentiation in zebrafish, we observed significant up-regulation of ascl <dig> , a proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor. importantly, ascl1a, the homolog to chicken ascl <dig>  has been used to reprogram fibroblasts to neurons
 <cit> . we also observed significant up-regulation of rx <dig>  which is related to eye field specification
 <cit>  . the importance of rx has been demonstrated during retina regeneration in pre-metamorphic xenopus laevis <cit> .

we next evaluated the expression of pax <dig> transcriptional factor, known to be a master regulator of eye development
 <cit> . different alternative splicing variants of pax <dig> have been identified in different vertebrates, with pax <dig>  and pax <dig>  being the most evolutionary conserved
 <cit> . the alternative splicing of pax <dig> transcript generates both forms with the variant 5a + that has an additional  <dig> amino acid residues inserted in the paired domain, resulting in different specific target genes
 <cit> . in the chick, pax <dig> is expressed in retinal progenitor cells in early stages of eye development and later in ganglion, horizontal and amacrine cells
 <cit> . to determine whether the expression of both alternative splice variants can be regulated in the injured rpe, we performed rt-qpcr using specific primers for both pax <dig>  and pax <dig> . although both variants were up-regulated at 6 h pr, we observed a more prominent up-regulation of pax <dig>  at 6 h pr ). by contrast, pax <dig>  showed a higher expression at 24 h pr ) . these data suggest that pax <dig>  and  are differentially regulated in the rpe after removing the retina. interestingly, in the chick, when the optic vesicle is formed, the two splice variants of pax <dig> are expressed in both the central nervous system and the eye primordium, with the pax <dig>  variant being the most abundant
 <cit> . in xenopus laevis, pax <dig> is up-regulated in rpe cells soon after removal from the choroid, and this expression is not dependent on fgf <dig>  although the regulation of specific variants has not been explored. in the same study, it was suggested that pax <dig> expression was triggered by the alteration of the cell-extracellular matrix and/or cell-cell interactions
 <cit> . it is possible that a similar effect can occur in the injured rpe in our system. interestingly, zebrafish has two paralogs of pax <dig>  that are required at different points of neuronal progenitor proliferation after light-damage to the retina
 <cit> .

during mouse brain development, pax <dig>  affects cell proliferation but not neural differentiation. by contrast, the canonical pax <dig>  affects cell proliferation and differentiation
 <cit> . it is possible that during the process of rpe transdifferentiation the alternative splice variants of pax <dig> observed here have different functions or different gene targets. collectively, these results suggest that upon retina removal at e <dig> , the quiescent cells of the rpe dedifferentiate to become progenitor-like cells similar to the cells of the optic vesicle that express the combination of eye field transcriptional factors and the factors sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig>  this process is transient and not sustained if no growth factors are present.

fgf <dig> allows for the sustained transcriptional activity of sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> in retinal pigmented epithelium undergoing reprogramming towards retina progenitors
to analyze the effect on the levels of expression of the pluripotency-inducing factors during the process of rpe transdifferentiation, we performed surgeries at e <dig> in which fgf <dig> heparin-coated beads were placed in the optic cup as previously described
 <cit> . thereafter, the embryos were collected at different times  and processed for laser capture microdissection. in an attempt to avoid variation in the rpe collection, all samples were collected close to the fgf <dig> bead . the rt-qpcr analysis demonstrated that the expression of sox <dig> and c-myc was enhanced and sustained up to 72 h, when the rpe is reprogrammed towards retinal progenitors . we did not observe expression of oct <dig> and nanog under these conditions. we also evaluated the levels of expression of eye field transcriptional factors and the expression of genes associated with the rpe phenotype . our rt-qpcr experiments demonstrated that the expression of rx <dig>  six <dig>  lhx <dig> and six <dig> was sustained at high levels . in contrast with the expression patterns during injury in the absence of fgf <dig>  the alternative splice variants pax <dig> 5a + and 5a- were up-regulated simultaneously from 6 h to 72 h . rpe transdifferentiation was confirmed by a significant decrease in expression of mitf and tyr at 72 h pr . immunostaining revealed that c-myc, sox <dig>  klf <dig> and the retina progenitor markers pax <dig> and chx <dig> were present at 72 h pr in the transdifferentiated rpe . in the absence of fgf <dig> at 72 h pr, the rpe did not transdifferentiate and remained pigmented, expressing only c-myc, klf <dig> and lin- <dig>  just as it does during normal development . as expected, in addition to transdifferentiated rpe, we also observed retina regeneration from the pool of stem/progenitor cells located in the ciliary margin of the chick eye 
 <cit> . thus, we conclude that fgf <dig> allows the sustained expression of sox <dig> and c-myc in retina progenitor cells along with eye field transcriptional factors to complete the transdifferentiation program of the rpe.

in agreement with our results, destruction of photoreceptors by acute light lesions in zebrafish central retina results in müller glia dedifferentiation  <dig> to 8 h post-lesion, exemplified by a strong rx <dig> immunoreactivity
 <cit> . we found a significant up-regulation of rx <dig> transcript at 6 h post-injury  during the transient dedifferentiation of the rpe . moreover, at 24 h post-lesion, a percentage of the activated zebrafish müller glia cells re-enter the cell cycle, just as the chick rpe does in the presence of fgf <dig> . interestingly, müller glia cells respond by dedifferentiating after local loss of contact with photoreceptors; however, this dedifferentiation is not enough to promote re-entry to the cell cycle. similarly, it is possible that the loss of contact between the rpe and the retina  triggers the process of rpe dedifferentiation, or that the process involves an inflammation molecule such as tnfα, as in zebrafish
 <cit> , or even anaphylatoxins such as c3a or interleukins like il- <dig>  which have been shown to play a role in chick retina regeneration
 <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that similar mechanism of dedifferentiation and proliferation could be shared between retina regeneration from the rpe and from müller glia cells.

overexpression of lin- <dig> induces retinal pigmented epithelium transdifferentiation
previously, it has been shown that lin- <dig> is present in the neural tube of mouse embryos, co-localizing with sox <dig>  interestingly, constitutive expression of lin- <dig> in mouse embryonic carcinoma cells increases neural differentiation
 <cit> . during human stem cell differentiation to neural progenitors, overexpression of lin- <dig> rescues the proliferation deficit associated with absence of sox <dig>  suggesting that lin- <dig> is important for proliferation of neural progenitors cells
 <cit> . in zebrafish, upon retinal injury, müller glia cells express the proneural gene ascl1a along with lin- <dig>  generating a regulatory loop in which ascl1a regulates lin- <dig>  which in turn negatively regulates the mirna let- <dig> <cit> . because both sox <dig> and the ascl <dig> are expressed during the process of rpe transdifferentiation , we decided to investigate the regulation of lin- <dig> expression in the injured eye and during fgf2-induced transdifferentiation. interestingly, in comparison with sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig>  we found that lin- <dig> was significantly up-regulated in the presence of fgf <dig>  but not with injury alone . consistent with our rt-qpcr results, lin- <dig> was detected in the transdifferentiated rpe at 72 h pr showing a cytoplasmic pattern . given that lin- <dig> mrna levels are only up-regulated in the presence of fgf <dig>  it is possible that lin- <dig> could play a role in completing the transdifferentiation process. thus, we wondered if lin- <dig> overexpression could be sufficient to induce rpe transdifferentiation in the absence of fgf <dig>  to address this question, we co-electroporated retinectomized chick eyes with a plasmid containing chicken lin- <dig>  and pires-gfp  or co-electroporation of pcdna <dig>  and pires-gfp as controls , and the embryos were collected 72 h pr. the systematic analysis of histological sections showed a range of effects on the rpe varying from clear thickened depigmented areas to full transdifferentiation . this range of effects is most likely due to the electroporation efficiency. unlike the remarkable effects observed with lin- <dig> overexpression, pires-gfp  electroporation did not show evidence of transdifferentiation or lack of pigmentation . furthermore, overexpression of lin- <dig> recapitulated fgf-induced transdifferentiation  as well as the amount of transdifferentiated area . collectively, these results demonstrate that lin- <dig> is sufficient to induce rpe transdifferentiation in the absence of an external source of fgf <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a series of factors that are up-regulated with injury only  including the factors sox <dig>  c-myc and klf <dig> and eye field transcriptional factors. in addition, we have found that lin- <dig>  a pluripotency-inducing factor and a microrna regulator that is also a critical player in other systems of regeneration, is only up-regulated upon addition of fgf <dig>  in the chick rpe after retina removal, at a time where there is no cell proliferation . finally, we demonstrated that lin- <dig> is sufficient to induce rpe transdifferentiation in chick retinectomized eyes in the absence of exogenous fgf <dig>  the conservation of a dedifferentiation molecular profile between regenerative models including retina, lens and limb or fin regeneration is indicative of a common process to reprogram cells to a plastic state, where the cells can be directed to expand and respond to environmental cues in order to differentiate and replace lost cells and tissues.
