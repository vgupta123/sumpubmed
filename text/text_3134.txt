BACKGROUND
disruption of the blood brain barrier  is a common feature of several devastating immune-mediated neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, dengue hemorrhagic fever, cerebral malaria, stroke, and acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis 
 <cit> . the underlying molecular mechanisms of bbb disruption observed in these conditions remain poorly understood, undermining the development of potential therapeutic approaches for human diseases characterized by bbb disruption. our lab developed an inducible murine model of cns vascular permeability using a variation of the theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus  model commonly used to study multiple sclerosis. in this model, peptide-specific stimulation of cns-infiltrating cd <dig> t cells in vivo initiates disruption of the bbb, resulting in astrocyte activation, severe cns vascular permeability, and functional motor deficits, followed by death within 48 hours. this peptide induced fatal syndrome  is dependent on perforin expression, but does not rely on neutrophils, cd <dig> t cells, tnf-α, ifn-γ, ltβr or il-1
 <cit> .

in addition to cns-infiltrating cd <dig> t cells and their effector functions, there is potential for other genetic factors to contribute to bbb disruption. c57bl/6j  and 129s1/svimj  mice both express the h2-db class i molecule and thus are resistant to chronic tmev infection and demyelinating syndrome
 <cit> . however, despite having identical mhc class i molecules, epitope-specific cns-infiltrating cd <dig> t cells, and equivalent cytotoxic t lymphocyte  perforin-mediated killing, b <dig> mice are highly susceptible to pifs, whereas 129s <dig> mice remain resistant. this difference in susceptibility was illustrated by higher glial fibrillary acidic protein  expression, increased cns vascular permeability, and severe functional motor deficit in vp2121-130-treated b <dig> mice when compared to vp2121-130-treated 129s <dig> mice. furthermore, this susceptibility is transferable with the bone marrow compartment. 129s <dig> mice reconstituted with b <dig> bone marrow exhibit severe cns vascular permeability, microhemorrhage formation, and functional deficit when compared to 129s <dig> mice receiving autologous bone marrow transfer
 <cit> . through an initial microsatellite analysis, we have determined that the pifs phenotype is not mediated through a single gene, but rather is likely to be a complex condition
 <cit> .

in order to provide a more comprehensive analysis and determine the location of genes that influence the pifs phenotypes, we analyzed the f <dig> generation of brother-sister mated f <dig> animals from a b <dig> and 129s <dig> cross using qtl analysis. the quantifiable traits of astrocyte activation via gfap expression, cns vascular permeability via fluorescent molecule diffusion across the bbb, and functional motor deficits measured with rotarod activity were chosen for study because they differ by or exceed two standards of deviation when measured in the two parental strains, which is optimal for qtl analysis
 <cit> . we identified chromosomal regions that harbored qtls responsible for functional deficit and cns vascular permeability. additionally, we have identified candidate genes implicated in regulating these traits. these genes can be further investigated and may become potential targets for therapeutic approaches to ameliorate neurological disorders characterized by bbb disruption.

RESULTS
as shown in figure 
1a, b <dig> mice were crossed with 129s <dig> mice to yield an f <dig> generation, and then f <dig> hybrid mice were brother-sister mated to produce 303 f <dig> progeny. these mice were intracranially infected with tmev and then intravenously administered vp2121- <dig> peptide 7 days later to induce pifs. mice were then analyzed for cns vascular permeability, astrocyte expression of gfap, and functional motor deficit . b <dig> mice were susceptible to each of these phenotypes, while 129s <dig> mice remained resistant
 <cit> . f <dig> mice displayed variable susceptibility to each of these traits and were divided into susceptible and resistant groups based on whether they exhibited the trait or not. cns vascular permeability was evaluated using a fluorescent plate reader to detect fitc-albumin leakage in brain homogenates using established methods
 <cit> . samples were read at a <dig>  and a threshold value of  <dig> was used to determine susceptibility or resistance. astrocyte expression of gfap was detected through western blot analysis as previously published
 <cit> . expression values were based on gfap protein levels normalized to gapdh. we used a threshold value of  <dig> to categorize f <dig> mice into susceptible and resistant groups. functional motor deficit was assessed using the rotarod behavioral assay. a threshold value of 50% initial motor ability was used to categorize mice as susceptible or resistant . the phenotype data for each trait is illustrated by the mean ± sem for the f <dig> susceptible group and the f <dig> resistant group . no significant sex differences were observed in the f <dig> mice .

identification of qtl controlling quantitative traits associated with pifs
of the  <dig> snps analyzed, the most significant linkage to susceptibility to pifs was observed with markers on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  as illustrated by log-likelihood plots . significant lod scores were obtained for functional motor deficits, which mapped to chromosome  <dig>  , and cns vascular permeability, which mapped to chromosome  <dig>  . no significant lod score was obtained for astrocyte activation as measured by gfap expression . parental allele distribution of the linked snps within the qtl intervals that mapped to the phenotypes of functional motor deficits and cns vascular permeability were detected using 2 ×  <dig> contingency tables comparing b <dig> homozygous , heterozygous , and 129s <dig> homozygous  mice. the qtl location on chromosome  <dig> , estimated by a 95% confidence interval, was from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm, with the peak of linkage at  <dig>  cm. the qtl location on chromosome  <dig> , also estimated by a 95% confidence interval, was from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm, with the peak of linkage at  <dig>  cm. we found that the 129s <dig> strain contributed to low rotarod performance, while the b <dig> strain contributed to high rotarod performance on these markers . in addition, the 129s <dig> strain contributed to increased cns vascular permeability, whereas the b <dig> strain contributed to reduced cns vascular permeability in the pifs model .

 <dig> ×  <dig> contingency tables comparing b <dig> homozygous , heterozygous , and 129s <dig> homozygous  mice with regards to  functional motor deficits as measured by rotarod performance and  cns vascular permeability as measured by leakage of fitc-albumin into the cns.  mice displaying <50% initial ability were placed in the low f <dig> group, while mice displaying >50% initial ability were placed in the high f <dig> group. 129s <dig> contributes to low rotarod performance on chromosome  <dig> markers rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  while b <dig> contributes to high rotarod performance on these markers.  the low f <dig> group consists of mice with fitc scores < <dig>  while the high f <dig> group consists of mice with fitc scores > <dig>  b <dig> contributes to less cns vascular permeability on chromosome  <dig> markers rs <dig> and rs <dig>  while 129s <dig> contributes to more cns vascular permeability on these markers.

potential candidate genes implicated in regulating functional deficit and cns vascular permeability in cd <dig> t cell-initiated bbb disruption
using the mouse genome informatics database resources , we performed a search between the base pairs of the significant loci found on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig>  in order to discover genes located in proximity with these loci. our search revealed  <dig> candidate genes on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> candidate genes on chromosome  <dig> . we then prioritized these genes based on known or presumed biological function and previous studies, allowing us to narrow down this list to  <dig> genes of interest on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> genes of interest on chromosome  <dig>  we focused on genes exhibiting potential immunological, hematopoietic, apoptotic, or cns-related functions since factors related to these processes are likely to play a role in cd <dig> t cell-initiated bbb disruption. we then used the mouse phenome database  to determine the number of snps in these genes of interest that are different between the b <dig> and 129s <dig> mouse strains as well as the location of these snps .

shown are a list of genes between the significant loci found on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> . genes that exhibited potential immunological, hematopoietic, apoptotic, or cns-related functions were categorized as genes of interest.

shown are the genes of interest found on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> along with their proposed functions. the mouse phenome database  was used to determine the number of snps that are different between the b <dig> and 129s <dig> mouse strains as well as their location.

discussion
in this study, we investigated the role of genetic factors involved with cd <dig> t cell-initiated fatal bbb disruption. we previously demonstrated that despite having identical mhc class i molecules, epitope-specific cns-infiltrating cd <dig> t cells, and similar levels of perforin-mediated killing, the b <dig> strain is highly susceptible to pifs, while the 129s <dig> strain remains resistant
 <cit> . this susceptibility is transferable with the bone marrow compartment, as 129s <dig> mice reconstituted with b <dig> bone marrow exhibit characteristics of the pifs phenotype, which include severe cns vascular permeability, microhemorrhage formation, and functional motor deficit, when compared to 129s <dig> mice receiving autologous bone marrow transfer
 <cit> . furthermore, by conducting a backcross of  f <dig> mice, we determined through microsatellite analysis that susceptibility to pifs is dictated in a complex fashion
 <cit> . therefore, we investigated the characteristics of pifs in f <dig> generation mice through analysis of three quantifiable traits, which include functional motor deficit on rotarod, activation of astrocytes, and cns vascular permeability. since we have shown that the means of each of these traits measured between the b <dig> and 129s <dig> mouse strains differ by greater than two standards of deviation, we expected to find a set of qtls for each trait measured
 <cit> .

we identified one novel qtl  on chromosome  <dig> linked to functional motor deficits and a second novel qtl  on chromosome  <dig> linked to cns vascular permeability. while causality cannot be determined in this study, we have not observed motor dysfunction without cns vascular permeability in the pifs model. furthermore, we discovered that the snp markers identified within the qtl intervals for the pifs-resistant 129s <dig> strain actually contributed to low rotarod performance and more cns vascular permeability, while the b <dig> strain contributed to functional motor preservation and reduced cns vascular permeability. while this was an unexpected result, it is possible that the expression of susceptibility loci may be suppressed by the presence of other loci in the parental strain. however, since new genetic combinations can be revealed through an f <dig> analysis, the identification of cryptic qtl becomes possible. for example, a genetic analysis of  f <dig> progeny to study atherosclerosis revealed that the fvb/nj strain, which is more resistant to atherosclerosis than the b <dig> strain, actually contributed to high levels of the disease
 <cit> . therefore, while our finding may seem surprising, it is important to note that disease-resistant strains also harbor susceptibility alleles, consistent with other genetic studies
 <cit> .

identification of qtl regions that influence resistance and susceptibility to pifs has enabled us to identify candidate genes that mediate protection from pifs and thus are potential targets for therapy in diseases characterized by bbb disruption. genes whose biological function had relevance to playing a role in bbb disruption were categorized as genes of interest and will be targeted first in future studies. genes of interest pertaining to mouse functional ability on chromosome  <dig> include tribbles homolog  <dig> , which has been shown to induce apoptosis of cells in hematopoietic origin. additionally, mice homozygous for a null trib <dig> allele display increased mean percentage of cd <dig> t cells. furthermore, trib <dig> has also been characterized as one of the top non-hla markers associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis
 <cit> . considering our previous research on the critical roles of cd <dig> t cells and hematopoietic factors in mediating bbb disruption, trib <dig> will be a candidate for future study
 <cit> . other genes of interest include lpin <dig> and rock <dig>  which both play a role in organization of the actin cytoskeleton, vsnl <dig>  which plays a role in neuronal ca2+ sensor proteins, kcnf <dig>  which plays a role in neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability, and ddx <dig>  which plays a role in viral responses. genes of interest on chromosome  <dig> that may affect cns vascular permeability include pde10a, qk, pacrg, park <dig>  plg, igf2r, mas <dig>  and mllt <dig>  these genes exhibit a variety of functions that may be involved in causing disruption of the bbb and ensuing cns vascular permeability. for example, mllt <dig> has been shown to play a role in adherens junctions and cell junctions. plg has been demonstrated to be involved in apoptotic processes and vessel development. additionally, mas <dig> is involved in inflammatory responses, igf2r is involved in edema, and qk and pacrg both play a role in myelinization. furthermore, park <dig> has been shown to contribute to neuron projection as well as neuron death, and pde10a has been shown to be involved in signal transduction and neuronal cell bodies . furthermore, we used the online mendelian inheritance in man  database  to investigate whether any of these genes of interest have been associated with any human neurological diseases. we found that vsnl <dig>  which is located on mouse chromosome  <dig>  has been implicated in alzheimer’s disease. qk, located on mouse chromosome  <dig>  has been proposed to play a role in myelin and oligodendrocyte dysfunction in schizophrenia. additionally, pacrg, also located on mouse chromosome  <dig>  may be involved in acquired, communicating hydrocephalus .

our comprehensive genetic analysis has allowed us to create this list of candidate genes, which will serve as a critical starting point in elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms of bbb disruption in neurological diseases. this will be an essential first step in developing potential therapeutic approaches to treat these diseases. validating strain differences in primary dna sequences in candidate genes and performing bioassays to test for functional consequences of primary dna differences will be essential in this process. it will also be essential to test candidate genes for their ability to contribute to susceptibility or resistance to functional deficit and bbb disruption in the pifs model. testing specific congenic strains in which potential genes of interest will be introduced will help define the importance of the qtls detected in this study. this approach has been successful in other genetic studies
 <cit> . generation of bacterial artificial chromosome  transgenic mice using the candidate genes we have identified will also be beneficial in evaluating the importance of our novel qtls. this will enable us to test whether strain-specific variation in one or more of these genes is responsible for causing the qtl effects we observed
 <cit> . this method has been carried out successfully in other genetic studies of strain comparison, such as evaluating the difference in seizure susceptibility between b <dig> and dba/ <dig> mouse strains
 <cit> . ultimately, results obtained from these experiments may hold promise for therapeutic intervention of immune-mediated neurological diseases characterized by extensive bbb disruption.

CONCLUSIONS
the comprehensive genetic analysis performed in this study has enabled us to identify qtl linked to functional motor deficits and cns vascular permeability, which are both devastating characteristics associated with cd <dig> t cell-initiated bbb disruption. furthermore, identification of these critical qtl intervals has revealed a list of candidate genes implicated in regulating these traits. these findings are important because they will set the stage for future research to identify novel factors encoded by these genes that affect immune-mediated bbb disruption. this may ultimately hold promise for devising potential therapeutic approaches to treat the numerous immune-mediated neurological disorders characterized by bbb disruption.
