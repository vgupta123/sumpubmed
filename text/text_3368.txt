BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cells contain many internal organelles surrounded by membrane boundaries, where specialised and essential functions are performed. the traffic between these different organelles is mainly mediated by vesicular transport  <cit> . the mechanism required for this type of transport involves a complex and specifically regulated machinery that allows budding of vesicles from a donor compartment, followed by their translocation to their target, to which they have to dock and then fuse. among the lipid and protein factors that are thought to be involved in these processes, a large family of proteins called soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor  adaptor proteins  receptors  are considered essential .

snares were originally classified according to the membrane component where they were required, as v-snares  or t-snares   <cit> . these proteins have a helical structure and the interaction between v-snares and t-snares leads to the formation of a trans-snare complex consisting of four snare motifs in a parallel four-helical bundle catalysing the docking and fusion of the vesicle with the target compartment  <cit> . tethering factors and regulators such as rab or sec1/munc family of proteins allow a fine spatial and temporal control of snare-mediated fusion and might as well monitor specificity  <cit> . one possible contradiction with the original snare hypothesis is that the same snare might be involved in several targeting events and be required either on a vesicle or a target membrane  <cit> . thus, rather than being functionally classified in v- and t-snares, these proteins can also be structurally distinguished. indeed, the snare motif involved in the formation of the helical bundle of the snare complex is conserved but bears unique features allowing the classification as q- and r-, according to the residue present in the centre of the motif  <cit> . the q group can be further divided into three sub-groups according to their overall homology in the snare domain: qa , qb  and qc   <cit> .

kinetoplastid parasites, such as trypanosoma or leishmania are very polarised cells that contain a dense and complex membrane network around the flagellar pocket, an invagination of the plasma membrane where the flagellum emerges from the cell body and where most of the exchanges with the external milieu occur  <cit> . the exocytic and endocytic pathways are contained within the anterior region of the leishmania cell and the polarised organelles include the endosomal and lysosomal systems, the golgi complex, but not the endoplasmic reticulum  that is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. kinetoplastids are among the earliest-branching eukaryotes possessing a mitochondrion. indeed, recent analyses combining taxon-rich nuclear small subunit rrna gene trees and protein phylogenies confirm that they are related to euglenoids  <cit> , with whom they form one of the eight eukaryotic group called discicristates  <cit> . thus, kinetoplastids constitute an interesting model to study the features of the vesicular and membrane transport systems that could have been conserved from more primitive eukaryotes  <cit> . more importantly, the very function of intracellular traffic has obvious implications for parasites, which depend extensively on endocytic and exocytic pathways, whether it is to get nutrients from the host or secrete virulence factors.

the recent availability of the complete genome sequence from leishmania major  <cit>  has allowed us to conduct a genome-wide analysis of the potential snares present in the parasite. we have particularly focused on the members of the syntaxin subfamily to analyse their expression and, using gfp-tagged expression, elucidate their location within leishmania.

RESULTS
classification of snare domain-containing l. major predicted proteins
as snare proteins share a conserved functional domain, we used sequence homology searches to identify proteins bearing this snare coiled-coil domain in the l. major predicted proteome. we found  <dig> putative proteins and used a phylogenetic analysis to classify them after multiple sequence alignments of their snare domain  <cit> . when analysed, the leishmania sequences segregated to four different groups  in accordance with genome-wide classifications performed with other organisms  <cit> . the identification of each structural group was performed by including sequences from already characterised members of the qa  qb , qc  and r  groups. group clustering was then further checked by including more sequences from characterised human or yeast proteins and performing amino acid alignments of the snare domains . we could then confirm that the qa group, bearing members of the syntaxin family , is comprised of seven proteins in leishmania, that the same number of proteins are clustered in each of the qb and qc groups, whereas the r group comprises six members.

general and structural features of l. major snares
the l. major putative snares generally appear to have the conserved features observed for these proteins . most of them are small , and bear a c-terminal hydrophobic region that could act as membrane-anchoring domain. a few proteins  do not have any predicted transmembrane domain or gpi-anchor and thus might rely on a different process to bind to the membranes. indeed, lmjf <dig>  and lmjf <dig>  have predicted prenylation sites  and the same c-terminal cysteine residue of lmjf <dig>  could also be palmitoylated. protein lipidation has been shown before to be a way of linking snares to membranes, for example the human snares syntaxin  <dig>  <cit>  and ytk <dig>  can be both prenylated and palmitoylated  <cit> . the other two proteins lacking predicted transmembrane domains , also appear to be lacking putative lipidation sites, so their membrane attachment may be mediated by binding to another snare, as suggested for human snare snap- <dig>  <cit> .

all the identified sequences contained a single snare motif, generally located at the c-terminal end of the proteins. animals, higher plants and fungi contain snap-25-like proteins bearing two snare motifs, at their n- and c-termini . their n-terminal motif belongs to the qb group and the c-terminal one to the qc group. however, we could not identify any protein containing two snare motifs in l. major, which is consistent with the observation made previously for other early-branching eukaryotes such as trypanosoma brucei and the diplomonad giardia lamblia  <cit> .

most of the putative snares we identified were found to possess specific n-terminal domains . the qa/syntaxins group is usually characterised by the presence of a n-terminal helical bundle  that can in some cases fold back into a closed conformation to interact with the snare motif  <cit>  and be opened by regulator proteins. using secondary structure prediction programs, we could identify the presence of such a bundle in all the members of the qa group of l. major . a similar series of helixes could as well be unambiguously predicted in sequences from l. major snare members of the qb and qc groups . this is not surprising, as human syntaxin  <dig>  and vti <dig>  have also been shown to possess this feature  <cit> . another characteristic feature identified in l. major snares was found in the members of the r group. r-snares can be subdivided into short vamps , also called brevins, and long vamps, or longins, depending on whether they contain a short and variable domain or a conserved longin domain  at their n-terminus  <cit> . brevins seem to be absent from the l. major snare repertoire, as indeed they are from plasmodium falciparum and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . all of the six identified l. major proteins with a putative r-snare domain possessed a n-terminal extension, which could be clearly identified, for most of them, through sequence homology with the longin domain .

snare-interacting proteins
the n-terminal domains of snares are known to be involved in their regulation through interaction with several factors. as snares play a crucial role in membrane fusion, these events need to be tightly regulated in space and time and a variety of snare-interacting proteins have already been identified. we searched the l. major genomic database and identified some of the key factors that might help regulate the snare machinery .

some of the most essential regulators of snare complexes are the human snap and nsf proteins . nsf is an aaa-atpase that functions as an hexameric complex to dissociate the snare complex through hydrolysis of atp  <cit> . nsf is bound to the snare complex through an association with several α-snap proteins whose positively charged residues are linked to acidic charges of the snare complex  <cit> . humans also express a neurons-specific β-snap isoform and a related ubiquitous γ-snap, which might not be able to interact directly with the snare complex but interacts with nsf  <cit> . the l. major database contains a putative nsf  bearing a predicted aaa-atpase domain . we also found two isoforms of the α/β-snap family  and one orthologue of γ-snap . this would be consistent with the presence of well-conserved snare complex dissociation machinery in l. major.

another family of snare-regulating proteins is the sec1/munc <dig>  family, for which there is still controversy as to their putative snare-inhibiting or activating function  <cit> . however, recent data shows a potential role for mouse munc18- <dig> in establishing a strongly tethered state of the snare complex and also in regulating the vesicle delivery rate  <cit> . the mode of interaction of sm proteins with their cognate snare proteins also appears to be complex, and there could be distinct mechanisms at different stages in the snare assembly/disassembly cycle  <cit> . proteins of the sm family appear to function at different intracellular membrane compartments, have generally a high specificity for one snare protein and are thought to act as chaperone-like molecules  <cit> . for example, s. cerevisiae has four sm proteins: sec1p, located at the plasma membrane; sly1p, involved in cis-golgi traffic; vps45p, involved in trans-golgi traffic; vps33p, located at the vacuole/lysosome. in l. major, we found five putative sm proteins: one sly1-like, two vps45-like, one vps33-like and one sec1/munc18-like. this suggests that all the classes of sm proteins are present in l. major.

there are other proteins that have been shown to interact with snares and several of which are present only in certain species, or even specialised cell types in metazoans. most of these factors could not be identified in l. major, but some proteins orthologous to human snare-interacting proteins, including a putative epsin  <cit>  or a gate- <dig> orthologue  <cit>  could be found . similarly, orthologues to snare-interacting proteins from s. cerevisiae known as dna-damage inducible protein ddi1/vsm <dig>  <cit>  and members of the vtc complex  <cit> , are apparently also present in the l. major genome.

the qa/syntaxin sub-family: gene expression
characterisation of a neuronal endosomal snare complex showed it contained syn <dig> , vti1b , syn <dig>  and vamp <dig>   <cit>  and it is now generally believed that one member of each snare motif group  is involved in the formation of a single snare complex. thus, we analysed more thoroughly members of the qa/syntaxin sub-family only, to gain some general insights on the expression or localisation of leishmania snares.

first, to determine if the genes coding for the members of the qa group were transcribed, we isolated total rna from l. major promastigote and amastigote forms and performed semi-nested reverse transcriptase-pcr  using a mrna-specific "splice-leader"  primer to amplify syntaxin transcripts . in kinetoplastids, one of the major mechanisms regulating gene expression is at the level of translation  <cit> , thus the presence of mrna does not systematically account for the expression of the corresponding protein. however, we could detect transcripts for all genes belonging to the qa group in l. major promastigotes  and/or amastigotes , except lmjf <dig> , which might be expressed at a very low level, or in another developmental form. the identity of the dna fragments was confirmed by sequencing or restriction digest and all were as expected except for lmjf <dig>  in promastigotes, which was a pcr artefact . lmjf <dig> , lmjf <dig>  and lmjf <dig>  expression was only detected in promastigotes, lmjf <dig>  only in amastigotes, lmjf <dig>  and lmjf <dig>  in both life cycle stages. overall, these data suggest that, rather than being constant and ubiquitous, the expression of some of the snares in leishmania could be stage-regulated, which might reflect different trafficking requirements of different forms of the parasite.

the analysis of the mrna-derived pcr products also allowed us to determine the sl addition site and therefore the likely atg start codon for several of the genes. this was then compared with the automatic annotation carried out on the l. major genome  <cit> . a putative upstream in-frame start codon could be found for syntaxin 1-like gene lmjf <dig> , suggesting the production of a corresponding protein that would be longer than the one originally predicted. this is of importance as the additional n-terminal sequence lengthens the first two of the habc helixes that are proposed to have a role in the targeting and function of syntaxin  <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the product corresponding to lmjf <dig>  yielded a putative first start codon that was followed by three early stop codons shortly after, suggesting that the corresponding extended protein would not be produced and that lmjf <dig>  could be a pseudo gene. finally, sequencing of the 5' end of the product obtained for lmjf <dig>  in amastigotes identified a start codon potentially used that is upstream of the one annotated in the l. major genome. however, the n-terminal extension of the predicted protein, in this case, did not significantly modify the structure of the habc helixes as verified by software analysis .

the qa/syntaxin sub-family: protein locations
to identify the intracellular locations of snare complexes in l. major, we systematically tagged with gfp the n-terminal end of the seven qa members that we have identified and expressed them in l. major promastigotes in order to localise them by fluorescence microscopy. such an approach has been used successfully before, for example to determine the localisation of a. thaliana snares  <cit> . the seven genes coding for putative qa members were amplified from l. major genomic dna by pcr, cloned into a gfp-fusion expression vector  <cit> , transfected into l. major promastigotes. expression of the predicted fusion proteins for each gene was confirmed by western blot with an anti-gfp antibody  and the cells were then observed by fluorescence microscopy. as overexpression of the fusion proteins can potentially lead to a mistargeting to improper locations, great care was taken in analysing the localisations and looking for consistency of the obtained signals in cells displaying either weak or strong fluorescence.

a variety of fluorescence patterns were obtained and co-localisation with established cellular markers was used to tentatively identify the labelled compartments. with the exception of lmjf <dig> , all the constructs yielded localised signals, consistent with a presence in organelles of a vesicular nature and the probable membrane association of l. major qa snares. gfp-fused lmjf <dig>  and lmjf <dig>  produced similar types of signals, they were usually found to label a vesicular population concentrated at the anterior part of the cell . we used the lipophilic marker fm4- <dig> as an endocytic tracer in the gfp-lmjf <dig> -expressing cell line and found that after short incubation times , the gfp signal and fm4- <dig> were not co-localising, whereas longer incubation times  with the dye led to a co-localisation . this suggests that the gfp-fused protein was present in the late endosomes or lysosomes. similar results were obtained with the cell line expressing gfp-lmjf <dig>  . furthermore, in stationary-phase cultures from both cell lines, the signal could sometimes be seen extending in a characteristic tubular shape that was co-localising with fm4- <dig> . this probably represented a tubular type of endosome or the mvt-lysosome compartment  <cit> .

gfp-fused lmjf <dig>  and lmjf <dig>  displayed comparable signals, consisting of a variable number of puncta located throughout the cell body and often displaying a strong labelling at the anterior part of the cell, close to the mitochondrial dna  . lmjf <dig>  was generally found to display less of these puncta than lmjf <dig>  . as both proteins are somewhat similar in sequence to syntaxin  <dig> , which is a golgi syntaxin, and as the golgi apparatus is known to be located at the anterior part of the cell in kinetoplastids, we performed co-localisation studies with an antibody raised against t. brucei rab <dig>  a characterised kinetoplastid golgi apparatus marker  <cit> . the results show that, although closely located, the syntaxins and rab <dig> are in distinct locations . kinetoplastids possess a single golgi apparatus, but as this organelle has a complex architecture with multiple cisternae and a typical cis-trans organisation, the gfp-fused proteins could still be in a part of the golgi where rab <dig> is not present. the complex signal pattern, however, could be suggestive of a localisation within multiple cellular compartments. the presence of some punctate labelling in a part of the cell between the kinetoplast and the flagellar pocket zone might suggest an association with early endosomal compartments, but the lack of co-localisation with endocytosed dye fm4- <dig>  argue against this. the other gfp-stained structures in the rest of the cell body also remained unidentified, as no co-localisation could be shown with markers of the vesicular organelles acidocalcisomes  and glycosomes  .

gfp-fused lmjf <dig>  was found in a compartment next to the kinetoplast . the labelled structures appeared to be duplicated in dividing cells before segregating during cytokinesis , similarly to what was observed for the generation of a new golgi stack in dividing trypanosomes  <cit> . moreover, when the cells were also stained for rab <dig>  there was a close association of the two signals , although they do not totally overlap. hence, it appears that gfp-lmjf <dig>  is present in the golgi system but might not be in the same sub-compartment as rab <dig>  this correlates well with the fact that lmjf <dig>  appears to be a leishmania orthologue of syntaxin  <dig> , a golgi syntaxin.

when the gfp-fused predicted syntaxin  <dig> homologue lmjf <dig>   was expressed, all the cells displayed a very localised gfp signal at the very end of the anterior part of the cell body , and some cells also showed in addition an er-like reticulated staining pattern. we used the lipophilic tracer fm4- <dig>  known to accumulate in the flagellar pocket of kinetoplastids when incubated at 4°c  <cit> , to label this compartment. co-localisation between the gfp-lmjf <dig>  and fm4-64-labelled flagellar pocket revealed that the two signals were in distinct locations, but closely associated . this would be indicative of the presence of the gfp-fused protein in a compartment spatially close to the flagellar pocket. given the highly polarised organisation of the trafficking in kinetoplastids around the flagellar pocket, this would be consistent with a role of lmjf <dig>  in the cellular exchanges with the external milieu. cells transfected with the construct producing the gfp-fused short version of lmjf <dig>   displayed a reticulated signal of internal membranes, especially dense in the perinuclear zone . in kinetoplastids, the er comprises a nuclear envelope and a connected system of cisternal or tubular membranes that extends throughout the cell body. we performed co-localisation experiments between gfp-short lmjf <dig>  and er-resident protein lmlcb <dig>  <cit>  and found that there was an extensive co-localisation of the two signals . this would be consistent with a localisation of this version of gfp-lmjf <dig>  in a sub-compartment of the er. the n-terminal series of habc helixes from syntaxin  <dig> is proposed to be able to bind the coiled-coil region of the snare motif to prevent the protein from interacting with unwanted partners during its trafficking to the plasma membrane  <cit> . in a mammalian cell type not expressing the snap- <dig> snare protein, n-terminally-truncated chimeras of syntaxin 1a localise to the er, whereas the full-length protein is targeted to the plasma membrane  <cit> . this would appear to be similar in l. major, as the parasite lacks snap- <dig> homologues and we could localise the short form of lmjf <dig>  in the er.

finally lmjf <dig> , which only differs from the short lmjf <dig>  in its c-terminal part with the absence of a predicted transmembrane domain, displayed a cytoplasmic fluorescent signal once fused with gfp . no prenylation or palmitoylation site could be predicted for this protein  and the localisation of gfp fusions seems to confirm that it is not membrane-associated.

for several gfp-fusion proteins, some cells had labelling in more than one compartment. for instance, in some cells gfp-short lmjf <dig>  could apparently be seen in the golgi in addition to the er and, in a few cases, gfp-lmjf <dig>  was present on the plasma membrane in addition to the endo-lysosomal system. clearly, these could be artefactual mislocalisations due to an overexpression of the gfp-fused proteins, but might also represent the fact that some snares, although present in main organelle at steady-state levels, are cycling between two different compartments.

identifying l. major snares
when putative homologues of the l. major snares were searched for using blast, the returned results yielded e values generally higher than 10e- <dig> . in most cases, the homology was significant within the snare domain, but not throughout the whole sequence. the analysis of the snare domain allowed us to classify l. major snares into groups, but that is not sufficient to assign a function and a localisation to each individual snare. the localisation itself can be an additional clue to the identification of a snare, but as seen with the systematic gfp tagging of the members of the qa group, sometimes it does not clearly match the expected blast result, such as with lmjf <dig>  and lmjf <dig> . the signals that drive the localisation of snares are not well understood and can vary a lot: in some cases both the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain are of crucial importance, such as with syntaxin  <dig>  and sometimes only the cytoplasmic tail bears the targeting signal, like the di-leucine motif used by endosomal syntaxins  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

when combining manual sequence alignments and analysis  and information on their localisation, we can only confidently annotate a few of the leishmania snare proteins out of the  <dig> as orthologues of other known snares. these are qa snare lmjf <dig> , which shares 23% overall protein sequence identity with human syntaxin 5a and also localises to the golgi and qa snare lmjf <dig>  , which shares 38% and 39% identity in the snare domain with plasma membrane snares such as s. cerevisiae sso1p and human syntaxin 1a, respectively and whose localisation in leishmania shows it could be involved in a similar role. finally, although we did not study its localisation, r syntaxin lmjf <dig>  can be identified thanks to its sequence features, as it shares 37% overall protein sequence identity with human ytk <dig> and, like its orthologue, lacks a predicted transmembrane domain, but has a putative prenylation/palmitoylation site . however, in general, there is poor sequence conservation, which presumably reflects the great sequence divergence of snares between evolutionarily distant organisms. for instance, mammalian and yeast bet <dig> are short  snares from the qc group and only share  <dig> % amino acid sequence similarity between them. two of the three short putative l. major qc snares  share between  <dig> and 22%, respectively, amino acid identity with human bet <dig>  the remaining l. major short qc snare  did not return any significant blast result but shares  <dig> % amino acid identity with bet1-related mammalian gs <dig>  also a qc snare. bet <dig> and gs <dig> are not the only proteins involved in vesicle fusion in the golgi apparatus, but they are complexed to the same snare partners, although they act in an opposite directions for vesicle transport  <cit> . hence, beyond the information given by the sequence, or even the location of the protein, functional studies are crucial to clearly assign a function and a name to each individual snare.

peculiarities of l. major snares
the difficulty in clearly identifying snare homologues in l. major could also be due to the presence of a few novel snares in l. major. this suggestion is supported by the fact that several members of the groups gave plant snares as best blast hits , and plants such as arabidopsis thaliana have a large number of snares, some of which have a specialised and original role  <cit> . our bioinformatic analysis of the predicted l. major snares indeed reveals some peculiarities. first, leishmania seem to be lacking several types of snares including snap-25-like, large proteins bearing two snare motifs that can be found in fungi, plants and animals. similarly, our analysis did not reveal the presence of any brevin-like proteins in the r group. however, leishmania seem to possess a reasonably big snare repertoire  compared to the size of its genome and to the snares numbers of yeast  or even metazoan like caenorhabditis elegans  or drosophila melanogaster   <cit> . also, the snare hypothesis implies an involvement of one member of each snare group into a complex and interestingly in this regard, with the exception of the r group, leishmania possesses quite comparable numbers of proteins in the different groups. this suggests that the functions carried out by the missing snares can be performed by structurally different ones in leishmania. indeed, l. major might also possess snares not commonly found in other organisms. for instance, no homologue could be found for lmjf <dig>  , which is quite big for a snare  but yields a predicted c-terminal transmembrane domain and, more importantly, a bona fide snare motif of the qc type.

two other putative l. major proteins bearing a snare domain were also special in the fact that they did not seem to contain any predicted transmembrane domain or lipidation site for attachment to the membrane . not only does lmjf <dig>  not possess a predicted membrane attachment motif, but it is also very larege  for a snare protein and, despite having an apparent r-snare motif, is unlikely to be functional. it has been shown that several syntaxin-binding proteins, such as tomosyn, possess a snare-like coiled-coil domain that would allow them to bind to and regulate a snare complexes  <cit> . indeed, tomosyn regulates in space and time the release of neurotransmitters in neuronal tissues from mammals  <cit>  and also c. elegans  <cit> . interestingly, like lmjf <dig> , tomosyn is a large protein , lacking a c-terminal membrane anchor, and possessing a r-snare motif. however, lmjf <dig>  bears no significant sequence similarity and lacks the n-terminal wd <dig> repeats  present in tomosyns. we could also find lmjf <dig>  homologues in two other kinetoplastids trypanosoma brucei and t. cruzi, which suggests a conserved role for the protein in these parasites. however, it remains to be determined whether lmjf <dig>  is associated with the regulation of snare complexes. gfp-fusion of the predicted lmjf <dig>  showed that, indeed, it appeared to be soluble within the cytosol of cells . however, as the lmjf <dig>  gene is located in the leishmania genome in tandem with lmjf <dig> , which codes for a non-soluble qa snare and only differs in its predicted version by the last  <dig> nucleotides of its 3' sequence, it might have arisen by gene duplication but have lost functionality. indeed, a corresponding mrna could be detected, but was longer than expected and contained several stop codons in the 5' utr, suggesting that lmjf <dig>  could be a pseudogene. however, whether leishmania can still possibly produce the short soluble version of lmjf <dig>  remains to be determined.

the lmjf <dig> /lmjf <dig>  genes represent a good illustration of both the conservation and additional complexity of the snare function in leishmania. 5' mapping of the lmjf <dig>  mrna-derived product amplified by pcr suggests that the protein can be produced, however a shorter version, potentially produced from an in-frame atg, has a different cellular localisation. lmjf <dig>  is located near to the flagellar pocket, consistent with a role for a syntaxin  <dig> homologue, whereas n-terminally truncated lmjf <dig>  is found in the er, where artificially produced syntaxin  <dig> chimeras have been found in mammalian cells. if only the full-length version of syntaxin  <dig> is produced, this raises the question as to what snare would be involved in vesicular fusion in the er in leishmania, as no other member of the qa group was found to localise to this compartment. vesicular fusion in the er could be mediated in a different way in leishmania or, although in contradiction with the snare hypothesis, this function could be complemented by a member from different group. even if the phylogenetic analysis of the snare domains was quite clear, there could also have been a misannotation of one of the qa members, or it might be so divergent that it was not found in the genome database. the syntaxin  <dig> repertoire seems to be increased by alternative splicing in other organisms  <cit>  with tissue-specific expression profiles and functions. thus, another hypothesis is that leishmania could produce both lmjf <dig>  isoforms to act in different compartments as a part of different snare complexes. in any case, our findings only lay the groundwork for future functional studies and the analysis of the native snare proteins of leishmania could possibly unveil a few surprises.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> snare domain-containing putative proteins encoded in the genome of l. major, which could be classified into the four major groups of snares based on the sequence of their snare motif. the snare repertoire is more than can be found in organisms such as s. cerevisiae and c. elegans. additionally, we identified several putative regulatory proteins of the snare complexes. systematic gfp-fusion and in vivo expression of the members of the qa/syntaxin group also revealed targeting of some to specific intracellular compartments. together, these data suggest that l. major, and kinetoplastids in general, have a well-developed vesicle-fusion machinery of which features appear to be conserved throughout the various eukaryotic lineages. the amenability of these proteins to n-terminal gfp fusion should make some of the proteins useful markers for specific intracellular compartments that are currently lacking for the cell biology studies of kinetoplastid parasites. the snares are generally very divergent in sequence and, for most it has not been possible to ascribe a function in leishmania based solely on sequence similarity. to this end there is a need for targeted functional studies, especially because l. major also has some predicted snares that appear very peculiar in structure and so analyses of these could give insights into new functions and cellular mechanisms. our data suggest that the expression of certain snares may be stage-regulated in leishmania, and as the trafficking machinery is important for the virulence of these parasites, future studies may reveal some interesting opportunities to discover ways of interfering with critical pathways.
