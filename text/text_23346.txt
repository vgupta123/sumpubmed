BACKGROUND
bacillus cereus is a gram-positive, rod-shaped, motile and spore-forming bacterium with opportunistic pathogen properties in human, causing local and systemic infections. b. cereus is mostly observed as a causative agent of food poisoning. this species belongs to the b. cereus group that includes the closely related species bacillus anthracis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus weihenstephanensis, bacillus mycoides and bacillus pseudomycoides  <cit> . b. cereus produces several secreted proteins, including enterotoxins, cytolysins, phospholipases and proteases that may contribute to b. cereus pathogenicity. expression of most of these virulence factors is controlled by the pleiotropic transcriptional activator plcr  <cit> . this global regulator contributes to b. cereus virulence in mice, in insects  <cit>  and to rabbit endophthalmitis  <cit> . expression of the plcr regulon starts at the onset of the stationary phase of growth  <cit> . it results from a cell-cell communication system that requires papr, a peptide exported and re-imported in the bacterial cell as a mature form via an oligo-peptide permease  <cit> . the plcr-papr active complex binds a dna target site, designated as the plcr box, thus activating transcription of the plcr regulon genes  <cit> .

bacteria recognize and respond to a variety of environmental stimuli using various signal transduction mechanisms, including two-component systems   <cit> . tcs are characterized by a histidine kinase  sensor coupled with a cognate response regulator. perception of a particular stimulus by the hk leads to its autophosphorylation. the phosphoryl group is then transferred to the response regulator, usually leading to transcriptional activation of genes. tcs are widespread among bacteria, and the number of tcs encoding genes found in a bacterium is usually proportional to the size of its genome  <cit> .

genome sequencing of b. cereus strain atcc  <dig> has revealed the presence of  <dig> sensor kinases  <cit> . most of them are also found in other members of the b. cereus group for which the genome sequence is available, including b. anthracis and b. thuringiensis  <cit> .

tcs controlling expression of virulence factors have been shown in several bacteria, including b. cereus. recently, the b. cereus resde tcs which is involved in low oxydo-reduction potential adaptation was shown to control enterotoxin production under anaerobiosis  <cit> . in contrast, the b. cereus yvrgh tcs, of which the encoding genes are located in the vicinity of the cytotoxin k encoding gene, was not required for expression of this virulence factor  <cit> .

tcs encoding genes are often located in the same chromosomal region as the genes that they control, as for example in b. subtilis with the deskr, citst, yycfg, bcers and liars tcs  <cit> . in the b. cereus group, the tcs encoding yvftu genes are located in the vicinity of plcr. to determine whether the yvftu tcs plays a role in the expression of plcr and consequently of the plcr regulon, the phenotype of a yvftu mutant constructed in the b. cereus strain atcc  <dig> was analyzed.

RESULTS
identification of genes encoding a tcs in the vicinity of the plcr locus among the b. cereus group
genes encoding a tcs  were located between  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb on the minus strand of the b. cereus atcc  <dig> chromosome . using blastp, the deduced amino acid sequences of bc <dig> and bc <dig> genes appeared to be homologous to both the b. subtilis yocf and yocg   and the b. subtilis yvft and yvfu . in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  genes encoding a putative abc transporter  were located upstream from the bc <dig> and bc <dig> genes . orthologous abc transporter encoding genes were also located upstream from the yvftu genes in b. subtilis . the bc <dig> and bc <dig> genes studied here have been annotated as yocf and yocg in the b. cereus strain atcc  <dig>  <cit> . however, these genes were previously annotated yvft and yvfu in atcc  <dig>  <cit> . because of  their higher sequence homologies with the b. subtilis yvft and yvfu genes,  their conserved synteny with the b. subtilis yvftu locus , and  their previous annotations, the bc <dig> and bc <dig> genes were named as yvft and yvfu, respectively, throughout the present work.

in the strain atcc  <dig>  the yvftu genes were located in the vicinity of plcr  encoding a transcriptional regulator and its activating peptide encoding gene papr  . a putative protease encoding gene, nprb , was found between yvfu and plcr. among the b. cereus group strains, the yvftu genes were always located in the vicinity of plcr-papr . the synteny was conserved, except for nprb which is lacking in some strains of the b. cereus group. the presence or absence of the nprb gene seemed to be correlated to the taxonomic position of the strains  <cit> , according to the genome sequences available up to now in each taxonomic group.

domains in yvft and yvfu
putative motifs present in the deduced amino-acid sequences of yvft and yvfu were predicted according to the smart tool: yvft displays an atp binding domain , and a dimerisation and phosphoacceptor domain . yvft is most probably a membrane protein as revealed by the  <dig> predicted transmembrane domains in its n-terminal region. this histidine kinase belongs to the class iia defined by fabret et al.  <cit> , or to the class  <dig> according to grebe and stock  <cit> . yvfu, the cognate response regulator of yvft belongs to the narl class of response regulators  <cit> . yvfu displays a phosphoacceptor site  in the n-terminal region. the dna-binding motif  found in the c-terminal region suggests a transcriptional regulator function. the yvfu tcs corresponds to the reference code  <dig> defined by de been et al.  <cit> .

according to the published genome sequence  <cit> , the yvfu response regulator is smaller in strain atcc  <dig> than in other strains of the b. cereus group . however, our sequences from  <dig> independent pcr-amplified yvfu fragments differed from the genome data, by the absence of a cytosine at the position  <dig> in the yvfu gene which created a frameshift. the yvfu gene was consequently  <dig> bp longer , and the c-terminal-end of yvfu  included therefore  <dig> additional amino-acids. thus, yvfu from the atcc  <dig> strain displays a higher similarity with the other b. cereus group members' yvfu protein .

construction of a yvftu mutant
a mutant was constructed in b. cereus atcc  <dig> by interrupting both the yvft and yvfu genes. no difference was observed between Δyvftu and its parental strain during growth in lb at various incubation temperatures  .

expression of genes mapping in the yvftu locus
rt-pcr was performed on rna extracted from atcc  <dig> cells grown either in exponential  or stationary phase at t <dig> . the yvft and yvfu genes were co-transcribed as indicated by the detection of mrna overlapping both genes, during both exponential and stationary phase . the genes encoding putative abc transporters  were also co-transcribed in the same growth conditions . however, a signal overlapping bc <dig> and yvft genes was detected by rt-pcr only on rna extracted from cells harvested at t <dig> . thus, at certain growth stages, these  <dig> genes could be co-transcribed as a single operon.

the co-transcription of the yvftu genes alone  during exponential phase of growth suggested the existence of a specific promoter upstream from yvft. this result was confirmed by the identification of the 5'-end of the yvftu transcript mapping  <dig> bp upstream from the start codon , using the rapid amplification of cdna ends -pcr technique.

a yvft'lacz transcriptional fusion was therefore constructed on a plasmid and transferred in both b. cereus atcc  <dig> and Δyvftu strains. measurement of β-galactosidase activity throughout the kinetics of growth revealed a very low expression in both strains during the exponential phase and until two hours after the onset of stationary phase . then, β-galactosidase activity increased in both strains. these results indicate that yvftu was transcribed from its own promoter at a basal level in exponential phase of growth and transcription was increased during the stationary phase. no significant difference between the yvft-directed lacz transcription in the  <dig> strains at any time of the growth culture was observed .

because rt-pcr experiments revealed a co-transcription of yvftu with the two bc <dig> and bc <dig> genes at t <dig>  quantification of the promoter activity of the bc5355-bc5354-yvft-yvfu operon, was performed by constructing a bc5355'lacz transcriptional fusion. measurements of the β-galactosidase activity at t <dig> in the b. cereus atcc  <dig> and Δyvftu strains were   <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> miller units, respectively, and were not significantly different .

thus, disruption of the chromosomal yvftu genes did not alter the transcription of the plasmidic yvftu promoter, nor that of the plasmidic bc <dig> promoter, revealing that, in the tested conditions, the yvftu operon was not autoregulated.

plcr expression in the yvftu mutant
a transcriptional fusion between the plcr-promoter region from b. cereus strain atcc  <dig> and the lacz reporter gene was constructed  in order to determine the levels of plcr transcription in both the wt and Δyvftu strains throughout the kinetics of growth . measurement of β-galactosidase activity revealed that during the exponential phase, the plcr expression level was constant, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> miller units in both strains . in contrast, during the stationary phase, plcr expression increased in both strains, but this increase was faster in the wt strain than in Δyvftu. thus, during stationary phase, a higher plcr expression was detected in the wt strain as compared to that in Δyvftu .

expression of the plcr regulon in the yvftu mutant
to study the expression of the plcr regulon in Δyvftu, in comparison with that of its parental strain, a transcriptomic approach was performed. bacteria were grown in lb medium and were harvested two hours after the onset of the stationary phase of growth. at this time, 80% of the total amount of the extracellular proteins is produced in a plcr-dependent manner  <cit> .

the plcr regulon has recently been thoroughly defined by a microarray-based approach  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes belonging to this regulon, a significant differential expression of at least  <dig>  fold was observed between the  <dig> strains for  <dig> of them by the transcriptome analysis . these results revealed that the yvftu mutation changed the expression of only a small part of the plcr regulon at the transcriptional level, in the growth conditions used in this study.

a genes without a plcr box found directly upstream, but located in a putative plcr-regulated operon.

b absolute ratio of expression in the yvftu mutant vs wt. up- or downregulation of more than  <dig>  fold are presented.

c log <dig> of the absolute ratio. negative m-value, downregulated in the mutant; positive m-value, upregulated in the mutant. m-values of more than  <dig>  or less than - <dig>   are presented.

d p-value <  <dig>  obtained with the t-test was considered as significant

eight of these genes showed a reduced expression in Δyvftu, including plcr and its activating peptide encoding gene papr. relative real-time quantitative pcr  was performed and confirmed that in Δyvftu, the plcr mrna levels represented  <dig>  fold  of the mrna levels in the wt. some genes such as nprb, nheab, plcb, encoding toxins or degradative enzymes, were also downregulated . in contrast, the three genes encoding the haemolysin bl were overexpressed in the mutant. the hblc mrna levels in qrt-pcr were  <dig>  fold  higher in Δyvftu than in the wt and confirmed the results of the transciptomic analysis.

complementation of the Δyvftu strain was performed by introducing the yvftu genes under the control of their own promoter on a plasmid . the plcr mrna level was quantified in the resulting strain harvested  <dig> hours after the onset of stationary phase. in the complemented Δyvftu strain, the mrna level of plcr was restored: it was  <dig>  fold higher than in the wt strain and  <dig>  fold higher than in the wt strain harbouring the control plasmid .

because most virulence factors belonging to the plcr regulon are extracellular proteins, the extracellular proteome from  <dig> cultures of each of wt and Δyvftu strains was also analyzed. identification of proteins on gels after a two-dimensional electrophoresis was based on previous spots annotations performed in similar experimental conditions  <cit> . for confirmation,  <dig> spots were analysed by mass-spectrometry.

using the software imagemaster platinum, spot volume quantification was performed after normalization and a kruskal-wallis  test was applied to detect reproducible differences between the extracellular proteomes of the two strains. some differences were observed for spots corresponding to nprb and pc-plc . the three spots corresponding to three isoforms of nprb were found in a significant higher amount in the extracellular proteome of the wt  when compared to that of the yvftu mutant  . similarly, the mean % vol of spots corresponding to pc-plc  represented  <dig>  % vol and  <dig>  % vol in the extracellular proteomes of the wt and Δyvftu, respectively .

the total amount of nhe represented  <dig>  % vol and  <dig>  % vol  and  <dig>   and  <dig>  % vol , in the wt and Δyvftu extracellular proteomes, respectively. although differences were not significant , in each of the  <dig> runs, the amount of nhea and nheb was always higher in the gels of the wt extracellular proteome than in those of Δyvftu .

apart from those differences, the extracellular proteomes of both strains were similar. in particular, the amount of the other extracellular proteins known to be expressed in a plcr-dependent manner was not significantly affected by the yvftu mutation, confirming the small number of changes in expression of the plcr regulon observed by the transcriptomic analysis.

role of yvftu in some virulence features
virulence of the yvftu mutant was estimated in a galleria mellonella infection model. injection of various doses  of wt and yvftu mutant was performed into the g. mellonella hemocoel .

by using a probit analysis software, the ld <dig> at  <dig> hours post infection were estimated. for the wild type the ld <dig> was  <dig>  ×  <dig>  cfu and for the Δyvftu mutant the ld <dig> was  <dig>  ×  <dig>  cfu. test of parallelism and the virulence ratios at the ld <dig> level showed a significant  but small decrease ) in virulence with the Δyvftu mutant compared to the wt. no difference between Δyvftu and the wt in time-to-death was noticed .

when grown on sheep blood agar, the Δyvftu and the wt strains displayed an identical hemolysis phenotype. the two strains did not show significant difference in cytotoxicity on hela cells and on macrophages .

discussion
some orthologs of the b. cereus yvftu genes are found in other bacillus species. however, in none of these organisms the yvftu function has been studied. although the exact function of many tcs is unknown, the tcs encoding genes are often located in the same chromosomal region as the genes that they control. among the b. cereus group members, the yvftu genes are highly conserved, and are always located in the vicinity of plcr. because of this conserved synteny, we hypothesized a link between yvftu and plcr. expression of plcr was therefore studied in a yvftu mutant. the lower β-galactosidase activity measured in Δyvftu harboring a plcr'lacz transcriptional fusion revealed a transcription of plcr partly depending on yvftu. this dependence between yvftu and plcr expression was confirmed by transcriptome analysis and quantitative real-time pcr.

because the expression of plcr was affected by the yvftu mutation, we wondered about a consequently modified expression of the plcr regulon. the transcriptome and the extracellular proteome of both the wt and Δyvftu strains were analyzed, at the time of maximum protein concentration in the culture supernatant  <cit>  and when 80% of the total amount of the produced proteins is expressed in a plcr-dependent manner  <cit>  . at this stage, yvftu genes were transcribed, and the plcr transcription was partly yvftu-dependent. despite a lower level of plcr mrna in Δyvftu, the transcriptomic and proteomic analysis both revealed that the expression of the plcr regulon was mostly not affected by the yvftu mutation. this suggests that plcr can play its regulatory role even when expressed at a low level.

however, our results revealed that the decrease in plcr mrna levels caused by the yvftu mutation was concomitant to a differential expression at the transcriptional level of  <dig> plcr-regulated genes, with  <dig> genes showing a reduced expression in Δyvftu. an increase in expression of the  <dig> genes belonging to the hbl operon was observed in Δyvftu where plcr is expressed at a lower level, while hbl is known to be expressed in a plcr-dependent manner  <cit> . although performed in different growth conditions, such a lack of congruence between the trends of transcription of several plcr-regulated genes  and expression of plcr itself has been previously shown  <cit> . furthermore, the recent discovery of the involvement of another regulator  in hbl expression emphasizes the fine regulations occurring in b. cereus in addition to the plcr regulation  <cit> . the differential response of several genes among a particular regulon has been observed many times elsewhere, and it was recently suggested that in b. cereus, some diversity in the regulation of gene expression occurs within the plcr regulon  <cit> . all these findings, coupled with our results, suggest that expression of hbl and some other members of the plcr regulon can undergo subtle regulations which also involve yet unidentified factors, different from plcr.

for several genes showing reduced expression at the transcriptional level in Δyvftu, a concomitant decrease in the amount of their products was detected by 2d gel analysis. in some cases, differential expression was only observed with the transcriptomic approach . the relatively low levels of differential expression observed with the transcriptome analysis suggest that the proteomic approach was less sensitive in our conditions. furthermore, various post-transcriptional regulations might explain the lack of correlation between transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, as reported in several studies on other organisms .

in bacterial pathogens, several tcs mutants present attenuation in virulence  <cit> . in our study, the virulence of Δyvftu in the g. mellonella insect was also slightly lower than that of the wt strain. the reduced expression of nprb, plcb and nheab coupled with the lower amount of their products found in the extracellular proteome of Δyvftu may account for this reduction in virulence. however, this only slightly impaired virulence is not surprising, as Δyvftu did not present a major alteration of the plcr regulon, and considering the importance of this regulon in b. cereus insect virulence  <cit> .

expression of chromosomal genes not regulated by plcr was also affected by the yvftu mutation, as observed with the transcriptomic analysis . among them,  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed respectively higher and reduced expression by  <dig> fold or more. however, no major pathway was over-represented in this gene list, giving no clue for the identification of a signal triggering the activation of the yvftu tcs. an alignment of  <dig>  bp promoter regions of the genes listed in additional file  <dig> was performed using the meme programme. however, no conserved sequence was identified, suggesting that no highly conserved regulatory motif was responsible for an yvftu-dependent differential expression in these promoter regions.

CONCLUSIONS
this work showed that yvftu and plcr are genetically linked. a functional link was also shown by the identification of a yvftu dependent plcr expression. the decreased plcr expression observed in Δyvftu only slightly modified the expression of the plcr regulon, and slightly decreased the virulence of b. cereus in an insect model. a subtle regulation for some virulence factors produced by b. cereus exists in addition to the plcr regulation.
