BACKGROUND
lung development is a complex process, controlled by reciprocal interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells  <cit> . in mice, the primary lung epithelial buds undergo reiterated elongation and division from e <dig> , a process called branching morphogenesis, to form a tree-like airway structure with coordinated differentiation of epithelial and mesenchymal cells along proximal-distal airways. simultaneously, pulmonary vascular networks are formed by angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, and are eventually connected to the heart to establish the pulmonary circulation around e <dig>  <cit> . during lung branching morphogenesis, mesenchymal progenitor cells undergo active proliferation and differentiation, giving rise to diverse cell lineages, including airway and vascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and stromal fibroblasts. these mesenchyme-derived cell lineages not only provide a structural support for the formation of the branched airways and the vascular networks, but may also regulate the growth of epithelial and endothelial cells by generating various morphogenic signals such as bone morphogenetic proteins , fibroblast growth factors , and wnts  <cit> . however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which mesenchymal cells regulate early lung development are as yet incompletely understood.

adenomatous polyposis coli  was originally discovered as a tumor suppressor gene, and loss of function mutation of apc results in colon cancer  <cit> . apc is a large protein containing multi-domains that interact with a variety of proteins, including ctnnb <dig> /axin in canonical wnt signaling and microtubules  <cit> . therefore, apc plays a critical role in regulating many cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and chromosomal segregation. germline mutations of apc will not only lead to familial adenomatous polyposis  with associated epithelial lesions, but will also cause aggressive fibromatosis  in mesenchymal cells  <cit> . however, the lower incidence and benign features of desmoid tumors in patients with apc germline mutation suggest that apc may regulate mesenchymal cell biology through a mechanism different from that in epithelial cells.

homozygous mutation of apc in mice leads to early embryonic lethality, and conditional knockout  of apc in a variety of cell compartments other than mesenchyme suggests that apc plays important roles in development of brain cortex, skin, and thymus  <cit> . abrogation of apc in lung epithelial cells was found to disrupt differentiation of airway club cells and ciliated cells by upregulating the wnt/ctnnb <dig> pathway  <cit> , while direct activation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> in mouse embryonic lung epithelia induces cell lineage switching to intestinal cell types  <cit> . although numerous studies have focused on apc in ectoderm and endoderm derived cells, expression of apc in early embryonic lung mesenchyme was not detected  <cit> , and therefore, the roles of apc in developing lung mesenchymal cells have never been explored. herein, we have specifically deleted the apc gene in lung mesenchymal cells during mouse lung branching morphogenesis, and found that loss of apc function resulted in more severe and earlier phenotypes than those seen in the lung epithelial apc knockout, which include arrest of lung epithelial branching morphogenesis with condensed mesenchyme. an early rapid increase, followed by a decrease, in cell proliferation was observed in mesenchymal apc cko lung, due to wnt/ctnnb1-dependent and wnt/ctnnb1-independent mechanisms, respectively. mesenchymal cell differentiation was also disturbed in the apc cko lung, such as reduced airway and vascular smooth muscle cell generation and the presence of sox9-positive mesenchymal cell population in distal lung, as well as increased proteoglycan versican  production. interestingly, abnormality in both epithelial branching and endothelial network formation was also observed, which correlated with deregulation of growth factor production in mesenchymal cells . eventually, failure to establish an intact pulmonary circulation in the apc cko mice led to massive lung hemorrhage and fetal lethality at mid-gestation. therefore, our study suggests that apc in lung mesenchyme plays central roles in coordinating the proper development of several quite different cellular compartments during lung organogenesis.

RESULTS
homozygous deletion, but not heterozygous deletion, of apc resulted in ectopic activation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> in embryonic lung mesenchyme
using a tbx <dig> lung enhancer-driven tet-on transgenic system generated in our lab  <cit> , we were able to induce cre expression specifically in mouse embryonic lung mesenchymal cells . the apc cko mice were induced during lung branching morphogenesis by administering doxycycline  from e <dig> . deletion of apc exon  <dig> in lung tissue was verified at both genomic dna and mrna levels . since apc is a negative regulator for the wnt/ctnnb <dig> canonical pathway  <cit> , loss of apc function is expected to result in abnormal activation of ctnnb <dig>  in our homozygous apc cko embryos, hyperactivation of ctnnb <dig> was detected in embryonic lung mesenchyme, reflected by accumulation of non-phospho  ctnnb <dig> at as early as e <dig>  and significantly increased expression of axin <dig>  from e <dig>  . in contrast, staining of ctnnb <dig> in airway epithelial cells, mainly localized on apical cell membranes, was comparable between apc cko and wt lungs , confirming mesenchymal specificity of altered wnt signaling activity due to loss of apc function. interestingly, like the wild-type  controls, heterozygous apc cko  mice did not display detectable wnt/ctnnb <dig> activation in embryonic lung mesenchyme , suggesting that a single allele of wt apc gene is sufficient to suppress abnormal activation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> signaling in these cells.fig.  <dig> embryonic lung mesenchymal deletion of apc induced ectopic activation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> signaling. a induced cre expression specifically in embryonic lung mesenchyme by a tbx <dig> lung enhancer-driven tet-on system was verified in an mt-mg reporter mouse lung  one day after dox administration . mg  was only expressed when upstream floxed-mt  was deleted by the induced cre. b lung specificity of apc gene knockout at e <dig> . fetuses with different tail dna genotypes were listed, and the heterozygous  and homozygous  deletions of floxed -exon  <dig>  were confirmed in lung tissue genomic dnas. leakage of apc gene deletion in fetal lung was not detected in the absence of dox induction . c truncation of apc mrna transcript in apc conditional knockout lungs was verified by rt-pcr at e <dig> . d ectopic activation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> signaling in embryonic lung mesenchyme was detected by accumulated non-phospho  ctnnb <dig> in both cytoplasm and nucleus of mesenchymal cells. epithelial airway is highlighted with dashed line. e-f increased wnt canonical signaling activity in lung tissue was also verified by elevated axin <dig> expression using real-time pcr  and immunofluorescence staining 



lung mesenchyme-specific apc conditional knockout resulted in abnormal lung morphogenesis and fetal lethality at mid-gestation
abrogation of apc in lung mesenchyme starting from e <dig>  did not affect the overall growth of the embryos/fetuses by comparison of their body sizes among different genotypes . however, the apc cko fetuses had severe chest hemorrhages with dark blue coloration by gross view at e <dig>  , and died soon after e <dig> . in order to determine the dynamic changes of the phenotypes, lungs of apc cko embryos were isolated from e <dig>  to e <dig> . as shown in fig. 2b, most of the e <dig>  apc cko lungs had normal epithelial domain branches surrounded with appropriate mesenchyme comparable to wt littermate controls. however, one day later , airway branches of the apc cko lungs became difficult to see under a dissecting microscope due to a thickened and condensed mesenchymal compartment. the apc cko lung growth seemed fully arrested by e <dig> , with a size and appearance similar to apc cko lungs at e <dig> . in contrast, wt lungs grew rapidly with many airway branches. at e <dig> , lung tissue destruction with massive hemorrhage was detected in apc cko mice, explaining the lung contusion observed within the whole body view . interestingly, heterozygous apc cko did not result in any of the defects as described above, suggesting that one allele of apc in lung mesenchymal cells is sufficient for proper early lung development, which is consistent with the unaltered ctnnb <dig> activation shown above.fig.  <dig> mesenchymal-specific deletion of apc resulted in lung malformation. a
apc cko induced from e <dig>  led to thoracic hemorrhage indicated by dashed line at e <dig> . b gross view of isolated lungs showed that the apc cko caused mesenchymal hyperplasia at e <dig> , growth arrest at e <dig> , and massive hemorrhage at e <dig> . no significant change was observed between wt and apc heterozygous conditional knockout  lungs



the abnormal histology of the apc cko lung was further analyzed in h&e-stained tissue sections . although no significant difference was observed between e <dig>  wt and apc cko lungs, alteration of the mesenchymal structure in apc cko lungs was obvious starting from e <dig> , with circumferentially orientated and condensed mesenchymal cells around epithelial tubes . there were fewer airway epithelial tubes in apc cko lungs starting from e <dig>  . at e <dig> , a massive hemorrhage with peripheral lung tissue destruction was observed in apc cko fetuses .fig.  <dig> dynamic changes of abnormal lung structure in apc cko lungs. there was no significant histological difference in e <dig>  lungs between wt and apc cko mice. aggregative growth of mesenchymal cells in apc cko lungs was apparent from e <dig> . lung tissue  was interspersed with massive areas of hemorrhage at e <dig> 



as mentioned above, apc is a major negative regulator for wnt/ctnnb <dig> signaling, and the abnormal lung development in apc cko fetuses could be mediated by increased ctnnb <dig> activation, which was indeed detected in e <dig>  apc cko lung mesenchyme . to further determine the potential molecular mechanism, we performed a rescue experiment by generating apc cko in combination with heterozygous or homozygous ctnnb <dig> knockout in developing lung mesenchyme. surprisingly, reduction of ctnnb <dig> gene dosage by single allele deletion could not rescue lung phenotypes in apc cko fetuses , while null deletion of ctnnb <dig> alone  resulted in reduced branching morphogenesis without change in mesenchymal cell density. furthermore, null mutation of ctnnb <dig> in combination with apc cko  resulted in complicated lung growth arrest, but no mesenchymal condensation , suggesting that abnormal mesenchymal condensation of early apc cko fetal lung may be mediated by hyperactivation of ctnnb <dig> following apc deletion.fig.  <dig> phenotypic changes of e <dig>  lungs with apc and ctnnb <dig> double conditional knockout in lung mesenchyme. lung tissues with indicated apc and ctnnb <dig> genotypes were shown by gross view  and h&e-stained tissue sections . all fetal lungs shown here were positive for tbx4-rtta and teto-cre transgenes. dox induction was started from e <dig> 



loss of apc function in lung mesenchymal cells results in dynamic changes in cell proliferation that eventually lead to arrest of lung growth
given that apc is a negative regulator for wnt/ctnnb <dig> signaling, loss of apc function could have an important impact on mesenchymal cell proliferation. short-term 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine  incorporation was used to identify cells with active dna synthesis. consistently with activation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> signaling , increased 2-hour edu labeling was detected in lung mesenchymal cells rather than epithelial cells at e <dig> , one day after apc knockout induction . however, while both epithelial and mesenchymal cells in wt embryonic lungs retained a steady rate of cell proliferation shown by 2-hour edu labeling at e <dig>  and e <dig> , cell proliferation in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells of apc cko lungs was then significantly reduced . interestingly, mouse embryos with a lung mesenchyme-specific activation of ctnnb <dig> from e <dig>   had a sustained increase of lung mesenchymal cell proliferation, as detected by 2-hour edu incorporation during early lung development , suggesting that subsequent reduction of cell proliferation in apc cko lungs after e <dig>  is likely independent of aberrant ctnnb <dig> activation.fig.  <dig> dynamic changes in cell proliferation of apc cko lung. a-b increased dna synthesis, measured by edu incorporation, in mesenchymal cells was found in lungs of apc cko mice at e <dig>  , while decreased edu labeling was observed in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells in apc cko lungs after e <dig> . c-d increased edu incorporation persisted to e <dig>  in lung mesenchyme when constitutively active ctnnb <dig>  was expressed in mice with genotypes of tbx4-cre

to further understand the related mechanisms, we performed a pulse-chase experiment with edu labeling at e <dig>  and detection of the labeled dna at e <dig> . in wt lung, only a few cells were still positive for early edu labeling due to continuous cell division and rounds of dna synthesis . in contrast, the majority of lung mesenchymal cells in apc cko lungs were still edu-positive. interestingly, the sizes of mesenchymal cell nuclei in e <dig>  apc cko lungs  were significantly larger than those of wt littermate controls  and those of e <dig>  apc cko lungs . these data suggested that the cells with apc deletion were subsequently arrested in the cell cycle. since interaction between apc and the plus-end of microtubules is reported to be essential for spindle formation and chromatin segregation at metaphase in cultured cells  <cit> , cell cycle analysis of apc knockout lung mesenchyme was then performed in order to provide a potential mechanism for altered cell proliferation. surprisingly, most apc cko lung mesenchymal cells were negative for phosphorylated histone  <dig> , a marker of metaphase. instead, from e <dig> , they had more primary cilia as detected by acetylated α-tubulin staining , which is a post-mitotic cellular structure existing in g0/g <dig> phase  <cit> . these findings indicate that lung mesenchymal cells with apc deletion are arrested at g0/g <dig> phase rather than metaphase. to further verify this, single cell suspensions prepared from e <dig>  lung were assessed for their dna contents using propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting  analysis .  <dig> % of apc cko lung mesenchymal cells were in g0/g <dig> phase, a significantly higher percentage than that in the wt controls , while the cells at s and g2/m phases were relatively lower in apc cko lung  than those  in the wt controls. therefore, the significant reduction of cell proliferation seen in the apc cko lung after e <dig>  was not due to metaphase arrest, but rather due to more cells exiting the cell cycle.fig.  <dig> cell cycle arrest at g0/g <dig> phase in e <dig>  apc cko lung. a significant reduction of cell division in e <dig>  apc cko lung, indicated by increased cells that retain edu dna labeling at e <dig> . increased nuclear size  was apparent in apc cko lung. b immunostaining for ph <dig> and acetyl-α-tubulin, markers for metaphase and g0/g <dig> phase, respectively. c facs analysis of dna contents for the cells isolated from e <dig>  apc cko or wt control lungs. d expression of key genes involved in regulation of cell cycle and senescence, detected by real-time pcr. *p <  <dig> , n =  <dig>  e protein levels of the related genes were detected by western blot



additional studies were performed to determine the cellular mechanisms underlying lung growth arrest, including cell senescence and apoptosis. the dynamic expression of key genes involved in the cell cycle was measured using real-time pcr . interestingly, c-myc expression was increased at e <dig> , not changed at e <dig> , and decreased at e <dig> . the increased c-myc protein expression in e <dig>  apc cko fetal lung mesenchymal cells was also verified by immunostaining . moreover, the mrna level of ccnd <dig>  was significantly reduced from e <dig>  to e <dig>  in apc cko lungs. the changes of gene expression at e <dig>  were further verified at the protein level by western blot . however, expression or activation of genes associated with cell senescence, glb <dig>  and phospho-p <dig>  <cit> , were not altered . in addition, activation of the apoptotic pathway and number of apoptotic cells, evaluated by caspase  <dig> activation and nuclear dna fragmentation , were not changed between apc cko lung and wt controls. therefore, with apoptosis and senescence ruled out, the impaired growth of embryonic lung in apc cko fetuses is likely due to g0/g <dig> cell cycle arrest.

apc is essential for appropriate mesenchymal cell differentiation and some extracellular matrix production
during branching morphogenesis, mesenchymal cells surrounding proximal airways or vasculature, marked by epithelial sox <dig> or endothelial pecam <dig>  differentiate into airway or vascular smooth muscle cells. however, abrogation of apc significantly inhibited both proximal airway and vasculature smooth muscle cell differentiation, as detected by α-smooth muscle actin  staining in fig. 7a. interestingly, some mesenchymal cells in e <dig>  peripheral lung of apc cko fetuses expressed sox <dig>  while only peripheral airway epithelial cells in the wt lung were positive for sox <dig> staining at this stage . although the exact identity of these sox9-positive mesenchymal cells is unknown, commitment and differentiation of lung mesenchymal cell lineages in apc cko lung appear to be severely disrupted.fig.  <dig> abrogation of apc altered lung mesenchymal cell differentiation. a deficient smooth muscle cell differentiation, detected by sma immunostaining, was observed in both proximal airways  and vasculature  of e <dig>  apc cko lung, which were marked by positively stained sox <dig> and pecam <dig>  respectively. b abnormal sox <dig> expression was seen in the mesenchymal cells disseminated in peripheral lung of apc cko after e <dig> . lung epithelial cells were marked by cytokeratin staining. cell nuclei were counterstained with dapi . *hematopoietic cells with non-specific autofluorescence in e <dig>  lungs



in addition to cellular changes, some extracellular matrix protein production and deposition were also altered in apc cko embryos after e <dig> . one of these was versican , a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. expression of vcan in normal embryonic lung is restricted to a thin mesenchymal cell layer that surrounds large airways after e <dig>  . however, abrogation of apc in embryonic lung mesenchyme induced ubiquitous and high expression of vcan, which overlapped with the pattern of excessive ctnnb <dig> activation. moreover, simultaneous abrogation of ctnnb <dig> in apc cko lung mesenchyme blocked the abnormal expression of vcan , suggesting that hyperactivation of the wnt/ctnnb <dig> pathway in apc cko lung mesenchyme is responsible for this phenotypic change. in order to determine the related molecular mechanism, the vcan promoter dna sequence was analyzed. at least two ctnnb1/tcf consensus binding sites  were identified in the vcan promoter . to further confirm the direct binding of ctnnb1/tcf to the vcan promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation  using anti-ctnnb <dig> antibody was performed for e <dig>  normal lung tissue. as shown in fig. 8d, both ctnnb1/tcf consensus binding sites mentioned above have been shown to interact with ctnnb1/tcf specifically, indicating that excessive expression of vcan is mediated by hyperactivation of the wnt/ctnnb <dig> pathway due to loss of apc inhibitory function.fig.  <dig> hyperactivation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> pathway caused by apc deletion in lung mesenchyme induced abnormal expression of vcan. a increased vcan protein expression and distribution were detected in apc cko lung after e <dig> , shown by immunofluorescence staining. cell nuclei were counterstained with dapi . b simultaneous deletion of ctnnb <dig> in e <dig>  apc cko lung mesenchyme blocked excessive vcan expression. c two sites containing ctnnb <dig> binding dna consensus sequences, which have been reported in ctnnb <dig> target gene axin <dig>  were identified in vcan promoter dna. d interaction between ctnnb <dig> and vcan promoter dna was validated by chip using anti-active ctnnb <dig> antibody. anti-histone h <dig> and normal igg were used as positive and negative controls, respectively



abrogation of mesenchymal apc function inhibited epithelial branching morphogenesis by a paracrine mechanism
lung epithelial branching morphogenesis requires coordinated signaling between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. mesenchymal apc cko resulted in smaller lung size at e <dig>  . the change in airway epithelial structure was visualized by whole mount e-cadherin immunofluorescence staining . compared to wt lungs, elongation of the primary epithelial tubes and terminal bud sprouting were drastically inhibited in the apc cko lungs. in order to understand the molecular mechanisms by which altered mesenchymal apc/ctnnb <dig> activity disrupts epithelial branching, expression of genes encoding key epithelial growth factors was examined. a substantial decrease of fgf <dig> expression  and a striking increase of bmp <dig> expression  at the mrna level were detected in apc cko lungs as early as e <dig> , before morphological changes had occurred . furthermore, whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that fgf <dig> expression domains at the distal tips of the lung bud mesenchyme were reduced or even absent , compared to those in the wt controls. in contrast, pronounced bmp <dig> expression was detected throughout the entire lung mesenchyme at e <dig> , compared to the relatively restricted pattern of bmp <dig> expression to the tips of epithelial cells in wt lung . changes of bmp <dig> and fgf <dig> protein expression in the entire lung tissue at e <dig>  were also confirmed by western blot . since bmp <dig> expression can be directly upregulated by wnt/ctnnb <dig> signaling in embryonic lung mesenchyme  <cit> , we then wondered whether defective fgf <dig> expression in the apc cko lung could be mediated by increased bmp <dig>  therefore, the regulatory effect of bmp <dig> on fgf <dig> gene expression in cultured human fetal lung fibroblast line hlf <dig> was examined. high concentrations of bmp <dig>  were able to inhibit fgf <dig> expression at both mrna and protein levels .fig.  <dig> lung epithelial branching morphogenesis was severely impaired in apc cko embryos. a lung epithelial branches at e <dig>  were visualized by whole mount e-cadherin immunofluorescence staining. b altered expression of fgf <dig> and bmp <dig> in apc cko lung at e <dig>  was detected by real-time pcr. *p <  <dig> , n =  <dig>  c whole mount in situ hybridization showed that fgf <dig> transcript was downregulated in the mesenchymal tips of apc cko lung at e <dig> . in contrast, bmp <dig> expression was dramatically increased in the sub-mesothelial mesenchyme of apc cko lung. insert: distal tip in the vibratome section. scale bar:  <dig> μm. d alterations of fgf <dig> and bmp <dig> expression in e <dig>  apc cko lung were verified at the protein level by western blot. e-f treatment of cultured human fetal lung fibroblasts hlf <dig> with bmp <dig>  inhibited fgf <dig> expression at the mrna level  and the protein level . *p <  <dig> , n = 5



loss of mesenchymal apc function also disrupts lung vasculogenesis and formation of the pulmonary circulation by a paracrine mechanism
massive lung hemorrhage in apc cko fetuses occurred around e <dig>  , when the pulmonary circulation should have started. this suggests that mesenchymal apc function is essential for regulating lung vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis as well as for building intact pulmonary circulation networks. in order to determine the vascular continuity in apc cko lungs, fluorescein isothiocyanate -labeled lectin, an endothelial tracer, was injected into the right cardiac ventricle of e <dig>  live fetuses  <dig> min before lung harvest, and pulmonary vascular perfusion was visualized by fitc-lectin binding. in addition, all the vasculature within the same lung tissue section was labeled by pecam <dig> staining . we found that the proximal large vessels in apc cko lungs were readily perfused , while the distal small vessels were not . in contrast, a plexus-like pattern of lectin-labeled vasculature perfectly matched the pecam1-stained endothelial cells in the wt lungs, indicating thorough perfusion and a well-established pulmonary circulation at this stage. therefore, lung mesenchymal apc cko fetuses had disrupted pulmonary circulation due to disconnection between proximal vessels and the distal vasculature, which could result in the massive pulmonary hemorrhage and loss of blood, and eventually fetal lethality.fig.  <dig> 
apc knockout in lung mesenchyme disrupted pulmonary vascular network formation and pulmonary circulation continuity. a the endothelial cells of e <dig>  pulmonary vasculature that was connected to the right heart were labeled with fitc-lectin after its intracardial injection, while all mature vascular endothelial cells were immunostained with anti-pecam <dig>  b decreased expression of flk <dig> at the mrna level was readily detected in e <dig>  apc cko lungs, *p <  <dig> , n =  <dig>  c dynamic changes of angioblasts  and mature endothelial cells  in apc cko lung. reduced angioblasts were detected in apc cko lung at e <dig> , while both angioblasts and mature endothelial cell numbers appeared significantly reduced in apc cko lung at e <dig> . d increased ctnnb <dig> activation was not detected in flk1+ cells in apc cko lung. e reduced expression of igf <dig> and angpt <dig> at the mrna level was detected in apc cko lungs at e <dig>  



to further understand these related mechanisms, we then investigated the dynamic changes of lung vascular formation from e <dig>  to e <dig>  in apc cko mice by detecting two different endothelial cells markers: flk <dig> and pecam <dig>  flk <dig> is present in both pre-mature and mature endothelial cells, while pecam <dig> is only expressed in mature endothelial cells  <cit> . thus, flk1+/pecam1− cells represent endothelial progenitors  and flk1+/pecam1+ cells are mature endothelial cells. at e <dig> , although both wt and apc cko lungs had comparable patterns of flk <dig> and pecam <dig> protein immunostaining, with the majority of cells being flk1+/pecam1+, flk <dig> expression at the mrna level in apc cko lung was already reduced significantly . one day later , flk1+/pecam1− cells in apc cko lung were decreased, accompanied by an overall reduction and simplification of the peripheral vascular network . furthermore, by e <dig> , a marked reduction of the entire vascular network was seen in apc cko lung, including reductions in both flk1+/pecam1+ and flk1+/pecam1− cells.

studies have shown that the pulmonary circulation network may be formed by two coordinated mechanisms, proximal angiogenesis and distal vasculogenesis  <cit> . our recent study using the tbx4-rtta/teto-cre/mt-mg reporter mice with dox induction from e <dig>  suggests that early lung mesenchymal progenitor cells give rise to the endothelial progenitor cells for vascular formation  <cit> . however, using the same driver/reporter line, we found that dox induction from e <dig>  did not mark both premature and mature endothelial cells with green fluorescent protein  , and therefore, deletion of the apc gene in our apc cko mice should not occur in these endothelial cells. this was further verified by no change of ctnnb <dig> activation in flk1+ cells of e <dig>  apc cko lungs induced from e <dig>  . thus, the effect of mesenchymal apc conditional knockout on vascular development was indirect, possibly through a paracrine mechanism. we then screened for changes of key growth factors that are important in vasculogenesis. surprisingly, there was no difference in vegf-a expression between wt and apc cko lungs . however, expression of igf <dig> and angpt <dig> at the mrna level was markedly reduced in e <dig>  apc cko lungs, suggesting that deregulation of multiple growth factors may disrupt pulmonary vascular formation in this model system.

discussion
although extensive studies have been performed to determine apc functions in epithelial progenitor/stem cell biology and tumorigenesis, the roles of apc in mesenchymal cells during development and tissue homeostasis have not been fully investigated. it is known that loss of apc function in mesenchymal progenitor cells in adults causes desmoid tumors, as seen in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. however, the role of mesenchymal apc in regulating tissue development and organogenesis has not been fully investigated. immunohistochemical results of a previous study indicated that expression of apc was restricted to embryonic lung epithelial cells  <cit> , raising the question of whether lung mesenchymal apc is necessary during early lung branching morphogenesis. however, by generating lung mesenchyme-specific genetic deletion of apc during development, our current study suggests that apc expression in early embryonic lung mesenchymal cells is in fact essential for both lung branching morphogenesis and pulmonary circulation establishment through a variety of mechanisms. thus, previous failure to detect apc protein in early lung mesenchyme could have resulted from low endogenous levels of apc and/or low affinity of the antibody used for immunostaining detection.

apc is a major negative regulator of wnt signaling, as it directly binds to ctnnb <dig> and forms a multi-protein complex with casein kinase iα, glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  and axin, resulting in ctnnb <dig> phosphorylation and ubiquitination-mediated degradation  <cit> . therefore, appropriate levels of apc can provide a fine-tuning for wnt/ctnnb <dig> activity. in general, hyperactivation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> promotes cell cycle progression, resulting in increased cell proliferation and decreased cell differentiation  <cit> . for example, ectopic expression of constitutively active ctnnb <dig> in fetal lung epithelial cells results in highly proliferative cuboidal epithelia that lack fully differentiated lung cell types  <cit> , while blockade of canonical wnt signaling in lung mesenchymal cells by deleting ctnnb <dig> causes cell arrest at g1/s and reduced lung growth  <cit> . in our present study, we found that specific abrogation of apc in lung mesenchymal cells caused an immediate increase in cell proliferation at e <dig>  , leading to the massive expansion of mesenchymal cells observed in e <dig>  lung . this might be attributed to activation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> signaling, as shown by accumulation of non-phospho  ctnnb <dig> and concomitantly increased expression of its target gene c-myc , a cell-cycle effector that contributes to g <dig> progression. however, such increased cell proliferation was not sustained, and instead, cell proliferation was then reduced by e <dig>  and lung growth was then arrested . interestingly, gain-of-function mutation in ctnnb <dig> by deleting its exon  <dig> in lung mesenchymal cells resulted in a prolonged increase in cell proliferation, with no subsequent decrease of cell proliferation, as observed as late as e <dig>  . thus, one possibility is that cell growth arrest in the apc cko lung is wnt/ctnnb <dig> independent. alternatively, deletion of the microtubule binding domain in our apc mutant might suggest another potential mechanism for reduced cell proliferation, since this domain mediates nuclear spindle assembly and chromatin segregation during mitosis  <cit> . however, cells in metaphase were not increased in our apc cko lungs; instead, most of the apc cko mesenchymal cells were arrested in g0/g <dig> phase at e <dig>  . furthermore, expression of both ccnd <dig> and c-myc genes in our apc cko lungs was significantly reduced after e <dig>  or later by an unknown mechanism. thus, considering all these results, deletion of apc in embryonic lung mesenchyme appears to directly promote cell proliferation by activating wnt/ctnnb <dig> signaling, followed by indirect inhibition of the cell cycle at g0/g <dig> by downregulation of ccnd <dig> and c-myc.

in addition to affecting cell proliferation, apc knockout also disrupted lung mesenchymal cell differentiation, in particular, airway and vascular smooth muscle cell formation. interestingly, carraro et al. reported that increased apc expression accompanied by downregulation of wnt/ctnnb <dig> activity, achieved by knocking down mir-142-3p, promoted parabronchial smooth muscle cell progenitor differentiation  <cit> . therefore, it seems that apc functions as a positive regulator for airway smooth muscle cell differentiation by inhibiting wnt/ctnnb <dig> activity. sox9-positive progenitor cells in normal peripheral lung are restricted to distal epithelial cells. interestingly, apc knockout resulted in sox9-positive mesenchymal cells disseminated in distal lung mesenchyme, which were negative for another chondrocyte marker collagen ii . the identity of those sox9-positive mesenchymal cells in peripheral lung remains to be determined. it has been reported that wnt/ctnnb <dig> does not regulate sox <dig> expression in lung epithelial cells, unlike in intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . considering the different patterns of ctnnb <dig> activation in all cells versus sparse sox9-positive cells in apc cko lung mesenchyme , expression of sox <dig> may not be due to wnt/ctnnb <dig> activation in lung mesenchymal cells. in addition, loss of apc function also causes excessive expression of vcan, a proteoglycan core molecule that has been shown to play a key role in regulating tissue development  <cit> . upregulated vcan expression is related to wnt/ctnnb1-stimulated fibroblast aggregative growth in vitro  <cit> , and to inhibition of neural crest migration through its anti-adhesive activity  <cit> . in our study, lung mesenchymal apc cko led to aberrant activation of ctnnb <dig> and vcan expression, which may result in aggregative growth of lung mesenchyme and inhibition of epithelial cell migration on the distal tips and branching in vivo. for the first time, we also mapped ctnnb1/tcf binding sites on a vcan promoter. taken together, our data suggest that apc functions as a key factor to control lung mesenchymal cell lineage commitment and differentiation possibly through both wnt/ctnnb1-dependent and wnt/ctnnb1-independent pathways.

in addition to affecting mesenchymal cell biology, abrogation of mesenchymal apc function also inhibited epithelial growth by disrupting multiple evolutionarily conserved growth factors, including fgf and bmps. it has been reported that mesenchymal fgf <dig> directly promotes both proliferation and chemotaxis of epithelial cells on the branching tips, accompanied by indirect induction of epithelial bmp <dig> expression. as a result, mesenchymal fgf <dig> expression at the tip is then inhibited through unknown mechanisms  <cit> . now for the first time, we have shown that a high level of bmp <dig> was able to inhibit fgf <dig> expression in cultured fetal lung fibroblasts, which is also consistent with our observation of opposing changes in bmp <dig> and fgf <dig> gene expression detected in our apc cko lungs .

in parallel with airway development, lung vasculogenesis and pulmonary circulation establishment are the other important events necessary to form a functional lung. studies have shown that pulmonary arteries grow into the lung from the hilum by angiogenic sprouting from the dorsal aorta or aortic sac  <cit> , whereas in the distal lung, vasculogenesis creates a capillary bed in the foregut mesoderm  <cit> . the distal and proximal components are then fused at e13-e <dig> in mice to complete the pulmonary vascular circuit. therefore, compromised continuity of the vasculature due to disconnection between distal and proximal vessels in the apc cko lungs likely led to vascular leakage around e <dig> when pulmonary circulation is initiated. this impaired continuity was also confirmed by observing trypan blue dye leakage in apc cko lungs after its intracardiac injection . this could explain why massive hemorrhage into the thoracic cavity occurred one day later . interestingly, it has been reported that blockade of wnt ligand production from fetal lung epithelial cells by deleting wntless  also results in pulmonary hemorrhage, but such lesion occurs at a late developmental stage  with less severity   <cit> . it appears that pulmonary hemorrhage caused by lung mesenchymal apc deletion versus epithelial wntless knockout is mediated by different mechanisms. vascular development is a complicated and multistep process that includes commitment of primitive progenitor cells to vascular progenitors  <cit> . by detecting dynamic changes in both angioblasts and mature endothelial cells, we found that the apc cko lung has an initially reduced population of vascular progenitors, and eventually a deficiency of mature endothelial cells . these changes are not directly caused by apc deletion in the endothelial linage because the tbx4-rtta driver line is not able to target the endothelial cell lineage after e <dig>  . instead, a paracrine mechanism originating in affected lung mesenchymal cells must to be involved in this phenotypic generation. igf <dig> is a potently angiogenic peptide to fetal lung endothelial cells  <cit> , which was reduced in our apc cko lungs . in addition, reduced angpt <dig> expression in apc cko lung could be another mechanism, since defects of angpt <dig> or its receptor tie <dig> result in impairment of vascular network remodeling and embryonic death  <cit> . angpt <dig> is also related to resistance to vascular leakage  <cit> . therefore, reduced expression of igf <dig> and angpt <dig> may be an important molecular mechanism underlying defective vasculogenesis and disconnected pulmonary circulation in the apc cko lungs.

CONCLUSIONS
apc in early embryonic lung mesenchymal cells plays a critical and diverse role in regulating lung epithelial branching morphogenesis and mesenchymal growth as well as pulmonary vascular network formation through both wnt/ctnnb1-dependent and wnt/ctnnb1-independent mechanisms .fig.  <dig> the postulated mechanisms of mesenchymal apc as a central player in early lung development. mesenchymal apc not only regulates mesenchymal cell biology but also coordinates development of other cell compartments through both wnt/ctnnb1-dependent and wnt/ctnnb1-independent pathways
