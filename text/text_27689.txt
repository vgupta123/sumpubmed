BACKGROUND
natural rubber produced by plants, known as polyisoprene, is the most widely used isoprenoid polymer. plant polyisoprenes can be classified into two types; cis- or -polyisoprene and trans- or -polyisoprene, depending on the type of polymerization of the isoprene unit   <cit> . more than  <dig> species of higher plants produce latex consisting of cis-polyisoprene  <cit> . hevea brasiliensis , which produces cis-polyisoprene, is the key source of commercial rubber because of its high rubber yields, and the excellent physical properties of the rubber products  <cit> . relatively few plant species produce trans-polyisoprene. those that are able to produce trans-polyisoprene include mimusops balata , palaquium gutta   <cit>  and eucommia ulmoides <cit> . trans-polyisoprene has several specific properties that differ from those of cis-polyisoprene. it is more rigid, provides excellent insulation, has an extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion/contraction, and is resistant to acid and alkali. these properties could be exploited in the manufacture of insulated cables, moulds, sports goods, and medical or scientific instruments  <cit> . currently, trans-polyisoprene is mainly produced synthetically, and no plant-based systems have been developed for commercial use.


to develop a suitable plant-based system for the large-scale production of trans-polyisoprene, we selected a trans-polyisoprene-producing plant, e. ulmoides oliver, as the target for genetic transformation. e. ulmoides is a deciduous, dioecious woody plant that produces a trans-polyisoprene known as eu-rubber in the leaves, root, bark, and pericarp  <cit> . in this study, we isolated and overexpressed an isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase  gene in e. ulmoides to enhance its trans-polyisoprene production. ipi catalyzes the interconversion of isopentenyl diphosphate  to its highly electrophilic isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate , which is an essential starter moiety for the first step in biosynthesis of all isoprenoids including polyisoprene . previous studies reported that overexpression of the ipi gene caused accumulation of many related downstream isoprenoid metabolites, such as carotenoids and terpenoid indole alkaloids  <cit> . all these reports suggested that ipi may be a target enzyme for regulating polyisoprene biosynthesis.

RESULTS
cloning and characterization of euipi cdna
to isolate the ipi gene from e. ulmoides, we designed one pair of degenerate primers for rt-pcr based on the sequence of a conserved region in the known plant ipis, including arabidopsis thaliana ipi , bupleurum chinense clone ipi , camptotheca acuminata ipi <dig> , h. brasiliensis ipi <dig> ; ipomoea sp. kenyan ipi , nicotiana tabacum ipi <dig> , periploca sepium ipi , pinus taeda ipi , solanum lycopersicum ipi , and zea mays ipi . the amplified pcr product  was used as a probe to screen the cdna library constructed from a mature e. ulmoides tree. one positive clone carried a full-length cdna insert that showed the highest homology to known ipis. this sequence was designated as euipi . sequence analysis showed that euipi was  <dig> bp in length, and contained a 675-bp open reading frame . the orf encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig>  . sequence alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence against those of other ipis revealed that euipi showed high identity  to other plant ipis. similar to other eukaryotic ipis reported previously, euipi contained a number of highly conserved regions that are common to ipis from higher plants and humans to yeasts  <cit> , and two residues, c  and e , in the tntccshpl motif and the wgehexdy motif , respectively, which are critical for catalytic activity of the enzyme  <cit> .


phylogenetic analysis based on the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of euipi with those of other ipis from different organisms including plants, bacteria, fungi, and animals demonstrated that euipi belonged to the plant ipi group  and had high homology with c. acuminata ipi <dig> . the phylogenetic analysis suggested that all ipis evolved from a common ancestor, and that euipi shared a common evolutionary origin with other plant ipis.


analysis of euipi enzymatic activity
to confirm that the gene product euipi was a functional ipi, the cdna was expressed in escherichia coli bl <dig> via a pgex-6p- <dig> expression system containing a glutathione s-transferase -tagged fusion protein sequence. this system is suitable for the production of soluble protein in the cytoplasm of e. coli. after induction with isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside , the e. coli cells harboring euipi produced a recombinant protein of approximately  <dig> kda. the digested protein  was used for the euipi activity assay, in which its ability to catalyze the production of dmapp from ipp was determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity incorporated into acid-labile reaction products . the proton nuclear magnetic resonance  spectrum from the reaction mixture showed four signals characteristic of dmapp , which were absent from the reaction mixture without ipi protein . the signals of the ipp substrate  were detected in the reaction mixture either with or without purified euipi protein. the spectra of ipp and dmapp were nearly identical to those published previously  <cit> . these results unambiguously indicated that the digested euipi protein was able to catalyze the conversion of ipp to dmapp in vitro, confirming that the cdna clone isolated from e. ulmoides encoded a functional ipp isomerase.


for euipi enzymatic activity assay, the 50-μl reaction mixture contained  <dig> nmol  ipp  substrate and  <dig> μg purified protein . radioactivity of reacted products was measured with a liquid scintillation counter as described in the materials and methods. distilled water  was used for background measurement; data represent means ± standard error, n= <dig> 

overexpression of euipi in e. ulmoides root lines
the cdna of euipi was inserted into the pmsisgfp vector, which was introduced into e. ulmoides roots via agrobacterium-mediated transformation. several kanamycin-resistant root lines with sgfp  fluorescence were obtained after selection and regeneration. pcr analysis confirmed that  <dig> root lines produced the predicted dna fragment, indicating that the transgenes were present in these transgenic root lines. some transgenic root lines showed defective phenotypes. eight pcr-positive  root lines showing strong growth were selected as representative euipi-overexpressing transgenic root lines for further analyses.

real-time rt-pcr analysis of the representative transgenic root lines showed that the expression level of the euipi gene was significantly increased in the overexpressing transgenic root lines . the highest expression level was in poeb5- <dig>  which showed 19-fold greater expression than that of the endogenous gene in the wild-type  control. these results confirmed that the overexpression approach successfully upregulated the expression level of euipi in transgenic e. ulmoides roots.


trans-polyisoprene analysis of transgenic e. ulmoides root lines
the total contents of trans-polyisoprenes in the representative transgenic root lines and their molecular weight distribution were determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry  and size exclusion chromatography . according to the report by takeno et al.  <cit> , the soxhlet extraction method coupled with pygc/ms analysis can remove low-molecular mass biosynthetic intermediates of cis- and trans-polyisoprenes, polyprenols, and other isoprenoids such as quinines , carotenoids, sterols, and chlorophylls. in addition, polyisoprenes isolated from bark and leaves of e. ulmoides via soxhlet extraction and fractionation were confirmed to be pure trans-polyisoprene by 13c nmr  <cit> . therefore, our pygc/ms analysis was able to sensitively identify the trans-polyisoprene content in the transgenic lines of e. ulmoides. pygc/ms analysis of eight representative euipi-overexpressing transgenic root lines showed that they contained increased total contents of trans-polyisoprenes , compared with the wild-type control. the trans-polyisoprenes contents in lines poeb5- <dig>  poeb5- <dig>  and poeb5- <dig> were 3- to 4-fold greater than that in the wild-type control. an overall comparison by analysis of variance  showed that the total contents of trans-polyisoprenes in overexpressing transgenic root lines were significantly greater than those in the wild-type control . these results indicated that up-regulation of euipi expression level increased the synthesis of trans-polyisoprenes in e. ulmoides root lines.


the molecular-weight distribution of the trans-polyisoprenes extracted from transgenic e. ulmoides root lines and the wild-type control showed a very broad  and distinct bimodal distribution pattern . the low- and high-molecular weight peaks were centered around  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. compared with those in the wild-type control, the three representative root lines overexpressing euipi  showed significantly increased peak areas in both the low molar mass region from  <dig> × <dig> to  <dig> × <dig>  and the high molar mass region from  <dig> × <dig> to  <dig> × <dig> , especially the latter. this increase was most evident in poeb5- <dig>  in the transgenic root lines poeb5- <dig>  poeb5- <dig>  and poeb5- <dig>  the low molar mass region accounted for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of all trans-polyisoprenes, respectively, and the high molar mass region accounted for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively. in the wild-type control, the low molar mass region accounted for  <dig> % of all trans-polyisoprenes and the high molar mass region accounted for  <dig> %. these results indicated that the transgenic root lines produced higher molecular weight trans-polyisoprenes than did the wild-type control.


discussion
we aimed to up-regulate ipi expression to enhance trans-polyisoprene production in e. ulmoides. in the plant isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway , the basic five-carbon unit ipp is synthesized in the cytoplasm via the mevalonic acid  pathway  <cit>  or in plastids via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate  pathway  <cit> . ipp is interconverted to its highly electrophilic isomer, dmapp, by the enzyme ipi at the first step. then, ipp is sequentially condensed to dmapp to yield the short-chain isoprenoid precursors geranyl diphosphate , farnesyl diphosphate , and geranylgeranyl diphosphate . these precursors are further metabolized for the biosynthesis of distinct sets of isoprenoids, such as monoterpenes , sesquiterpenes , diterpenes , and polyisoprenes  by various isoprenyl diphosphate synthases  <cit> . therefore, ipp and dmapp are starting materials at important regulatory branching points in the biosynthetic pathway of a variety of isoprenoids. ipi is thought to catalyze a regulatory step in isoprenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . it functions in supplying both the electrophilic primer substrate and the condensation substrate for isoprenoid biosynthesis, and provides the precursor for biosyntheses of various meroterpenoids  <cit> .

according to previous studies, ipis can be classified into two types: type i and type ii. type i ipis have been identified in various eukaryotic organisms including humans  <cit>  and saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , and in some bacteria including e. coli <cit>  and rhodobacter capsulatus <cit> . the type ii enzymes have been identified in archaea and some bacteria. these type ii enzymes are fmn and nadh dependent  <cit> . to date, no type ii ipi has been identified in the plant kingdom. type i ipis have a conserved c residue in a tntccshpl motif and a conserved e residue in a wgehexdy motif  <cit> . type ii ipis have a conserved motif that includes three g -rich sequences, mtgg, gxggt, and sgg  <cit> . these highly conserved residues are critical for the catalytic activity of the enzyme  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis revealed that euipi shared a common evolutionary origin with other plant ipis. euipi also contained the highly conserved c and e residues in the two motifs , suggesting that it belongs to the type i ipi family. the c and e residues are thought to face each other in the active site. the reaction is initiated by protonation of the double bond, a process that involves the e residue. the thiol moiety of c, presumably in the thiolate form, assists in removing the proton from the tertiary cation  <cit> . most plants have two type i ipi isozymes with distinct subcellular localizations. in tobacco, ipis are localized in the cytosol and plastids  <cit> , while in castor bean, ipis are present in mitochondria and proplastids. arabidopsis also has two ipi genes that may function in the plastids  <cit> . multiple alignment analysis showed that euipi shared high homology with c. acuminata ipi <dig> , a plastid ipi that resembles other plant ipis  <cit> . at present, the subcellular localization of euipi is still unknown, and so further research is required to clarify its exact location within the cell.

our results indicated that increasing the expression level of euipi increased synthesis of trans-polyisoprene in transgenic e. ulmoides. overexpression of the ipi gene in e. ulmoides enhanced trans-polyisoprene production by 3- to 4-fold compared with that in the wild-type. although the exact contribution of ipi to biosynthesis of trans-polyisoprene in transgenic e. ulmoides is unknown, our results demonstrated that regulation of ipi expression may be a key target for efficient production of trans-polyisoprene in e. ulmoides. a previous report on the prokaryote e. coli implied that maize ipi activity was critical for controlling the flux into the carotenoid pathway  <cit> , and thus, represented an important step in isoprenoid biosynthesis. similarly, in the green unicellular alga haematococcus pluvialis, expressions of ipi and two enzymes specific to the carotenoid pathway  resulted in a 3-to 6-fold increase in carotenoid accumulation after exposure to strong illumination  <cit> . on the other hand, silencing of the tobacco ipi led to a depletion of photosynthetic pigments, suggesting that reduced ipi activity affected isoprenoid biosynthesis in the plastids of tobacco leaves  <cit> . a site-directed specific inhibitor of ipi,  <dig> -oxido-3-methyl-1-butyl diphosphate , inhibited incorporation of ipp into polyisoprene in an in vitro rubber assay  <cit> . together, these findings imply that ipi catalyzes a key step in isoprenoid biosynthesis. consequently, ipi is an attractive target for metabolic engineering for efficient production of industrially useful isoprenoids, including polyisoprene.

the transgenic root line poeb5- <dig> showed the highest expression level of euipi, but did not show the highest accumulation of trans-polyisoprene. this may be because euipi is a rate-limiting enzyme  <cit>  whose catalysis is down-regulated by feedback inhibition  <cit> . to increase accumulation of trans-polyisoprene via biochemical pathways, it may be necessary to manipulate regulatory genes such as kinases or transcription factors to up-regulate entire pathways  <cit> .

since a multi-branched metabolic pathway is responsible for the synthesis of distinct isoprenoids, overexpression of only the first-step enzyme, ipi, cannot enhance polyisoprene production to an extremely high level. recently, we isolated a gene encoding trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase  and its co-factors, which have roles in prenyl chain elongation and the formation of rubber particle proteins in e. ulmoides . we anticipate that overexpression of these genes in addition to euipi will maximize the production of trans-polyisoprene in e. ulmoides.

e. ulmoides is a tertiary species that survives only in china  <cit> , but it can be cultivated from tropical to temperate zones, and even in cold regions, whereas other species producing trans-polyisoprene  grow only in the tropics. hence, e. ulmoides shows greater promise as an industrial raw material for commercial use. the results of our study will be helpful to develop e. ulmoides for large-scale production of trans-polyisoprene by genetic engineering.

CONCLUSIONS
to develop a plant-based system suitable for large-scale production of trans-polyisoprene, we selected a trans-polyisoprene-producing plant, eucommia ulmoides oliver, as the target for genetic transformation. a full-length cdna  encoding isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase  was isolated from e. ulmoides. euipi consists of  <dig> bp with a 675-bp open reading frame encoding a protein with  <dig> amino acid residues. euipi shared high identity with other plant ipis, and the recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli showed ipi enzymatic activity in vitro. euipi was introduced into e. ulmoides via agrobacterium-mediated transformation. transgenic lines of e. ulmoides overexpressing euipi showed increased euipi expression  and a 3- to 4-fold increase in the total content of trans-polyisoprenes, compared with the wild-type  control. ipi catalyzes the conversion of isopentenyl diphosphate to its highly electrophilic isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate, which is the first step in the biosynthesis of all isoprenoids, including polyisoprene. our results demonstrated that regulation of ipi expression is a key target for efficient production of trans-polyisoprene.
