BACKGROUND
enterococci constitute an integral part of the intestinal flora of many invertebrates, birds and mammals including humans. recent studies on livestock animals have improved our understanding of the role enterococci play as important intestinal colonisers by supporting intestinal, microbial homoeostasis, stimulating immune modulation and thus preventing infections with pathogenic bacteria and viruses  <cit> . commercial probiotic mixtures of enterococcus faecalis are sold with a supposed supportive role in anti-inflammation and prevention of allergic reactions. the genome sequence of one of these probiotic strains called symbioflor  <dig> has been released very recently  <cit> . enterococci have a supportive activity in food fermentation and preservation, because of their production of secondary metabolites and bacteriocins  <cit> . on the other hand, enterococci, in particular e. faecalis and e. faecium, are important conditional pathogens. e. faecalis has been attributed to various kinds of infections in humans in hospitals and in the community such as urinary tract infections, bacteraemia and/or endocarditis  <cit> .a in animals it is a common cause of mastitis in cattle  <cit> , and of urinary tract infections in dogs and cats.

in e. faecalis, a number of ‘classical’ virulence factors are essential for different kinds of and the course of infections. a cytolysin executes cytolytic, haemolytic and bacteriocinogenic activities capable of lysing prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the expression of the two-component cytolysin is highly regulated and controlled by quorum-sensing  <cit> . relevant genes are arranged in an operon structure which is encoded on a pathogenicity island  and/or a pheromone response plasmid of the pad <dig> type  <cit> . the association of cytolysin expression and increased toxicity of e. faecalis infections has been shown in various animal models, as well as in outcome-oriented clinical studies  <cit> . other well-described virulence factors such as gelatinase and serine protease have been singly shown to contribute to tissue invasion and translocation and thus to pathogenicity of e. faecalis infections in general  <cit> . corresponding genes gele-spre are genetically linked, co-regulated by fsr and co-transcribed  <cit> .

examples of e. faecalis surface-exposed virulence markers are capsular polysaccharides, glycolipids, surface-exposed lpxtg-type proteins, such as microbial surface components recognising adhesive matrix molecules , like the collagen-binding protein ace, pili called ebp, and aggregation substances  <cit> . surface protein-mediated adherence to host tissues leads to the first steps of enterococcal colonisation and subsequent biofilm formation, inflammation and infection.

the enterococcal surface protein esp is known to be involved in biofilm production and surface attachment  <cit> . the corresponding esp gene is part of the e. faecalis and e. faecium pai which shows different sizes and compositions in both species  <cit> . the e. faecalis pai in the reference isolate mmh <dig> is  <dig> kb long and part of the chromosome  <cit> . in e. faecium only isolates from clinical infections contain the pai, whereas in e. faecalis commensal  and environmental strains may also contain it  <cit> . supposed virulence genes of e. faecalis isolates as described above are also distributed among commensal and environmental isolates  <cit> . the exact composition of the e. faecalis pai varies in different strains. differences appear in the presence and absence of the six blocks described for the original pai of mmh <dig> which are flanked by mobile genetic elements  <cit> . parts of the pai including the 5′ encoded aggregation substance may be derived from the integration of plasmid fragments in the pai. aggregation substance is also an integral part of various types of e. faecalis pheromone plasmids of the pad1-, pcf10- and pam373-types  <cit> . the aggregation substance is essential in linking donor and recipient cells in pheromone-induced mating processes but also supports attachment to eukaryotic surfaces and intracellular routes of immune evasion  <cit> .

the enterococcal capsule locus  consists of  <dig> known open reading frames, namely cpsa-k. there are three known capsule operon polymorphisms:  cps type  <dig>  which includes all  <dig> genes ;  cps type  <dig>  which includes all genes except for cpsf ; and  cps type  <dig>  where only cpsa and cpsb are present   <cit> .

horizontal gene transfer  is supposed to play a key role in shaping enterococcal genomes, bacterial functionality and e. faecalis phylogeny  <cit> . this is exemplified by  the high number of mobile genetic elements in some sequenced e. faecalis genomes, such as v <dig> summing up to >25% and  recent phylogenetic analyses based on whole genome data  <cit> . various integrative and conjugative elements  are known in enterococcus, such as the conjugative tetracycline resistance transposons of the tn916-type and the aforementioned pheromone response plasmids, which allow very efficient gene transfer rates of up to 10e- <dig> per donor cell. in addition, broad host range plasmids of the inc18-type are also prevalent among e. faecalis which became prominent when transmitting vana-type vancomycin resistance from e. faecalis to mrsa  <cit> . ice can also mobilise other parts of the genomes when transferred as shown recently  <cit> . in e. faecium genome remodelling associated with acquisition and loss of mobile genetic elements has contributed to ecological niche separation with respect to domestic animals and to the evolution of a hospital-associated subpopulation as a cause of infections in immunocompromised humans; within ecological niches and/or distinct clonal lineages or complexes the level of genomic variance is minor  <cit> .

data from dna sequence-based typing of e. faecalis assessed by mlst suggest that a number of prominent clonal complexes which are common among animal and human isolates such as cc <dig>  cc <dig>  and cc <dig>  do not suggest any kind of host specificity and also less abundant clonal lineages were reported from urinary tract infections in humans and chickens  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis with respect to ecological separation and host specificity had not been performed for e. faecalis at the time when we initiated our study. typing by means of mlst of  <dig> e. faecalis isolates of a european collection revealed that specific types determined by mlst analyses and subsequent eburst clustering mainly belong to six clonal complexes  which play a predominant role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals and contribute to higher resistance rates in some countries  <cit> . in order to elucidate further the phylogenetic structure of a prominent mlst type and display possible routes of niche adaptation we focused on the most prevalent clonal type st <dig>  <cit> . we collected and typed  <dig> st <dig> isolates from worldwide and divergent ecological sources by phenotypic and molecular means and characterised a subset of them by whole genome sequence comparisons, functional assays including biolog analyses and animal experiments of colonisation and pathogenicity.

biolog phenotyping microarrays
biolog phenotyping microarrays  were used to analyse the metabolic phenotype with focus on utilisation of different carbon sources under aerobic conditions. briefly, bacteria were incubated on fresh mh agar plates  at 37°c for  <dig> h. with a sterile swab, bacteria were transferred into a sterile tube containing  <dig> ml if-0a medium  , and cell suspension was adjusted to 81% transmittance by using the biolog turbidimeter . in line with the manufacturer’s recommendations,  <dig> ml of the if-0a base  was mixed with  <dig>  ml redox dye mix d   and  <dig>  ml of a 12x additive solution, containing  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> × 6h2o  and  <dig> mm cacl <dig> ×  <dig> h2o . finally,  <dig>  ml of cell suspension was added.  <dig> μl of the final suspension was added to each well of the 96-well biolog pm <dig> and pm02a plates. the panels were placed in the omnilog instrument  and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h, whereby the utilisation of the carbon sources was measured spectrophotometrically and recorded every  <dig> min over the whole incubation period. all assays were repeated for at least three times on different days. data sets were evaluated by the omnilog kinetic and parametric analysis software version  <dig> . the area under the kinetic curve  was used to compare the utilisation of different carbon sources between the strains. calculation of the arithmetic averages with the corresponding standard deviations was done with microsoft excel. colour codes, used in additional file 2: table s6a and b, were chosen according to gripp and colleagues  <cit> .

growth kinetics
to determine the bacterial growth rates, overnight cultures were diluted 1: <dig> in ts broth and grown at 37°c with shaking. optical density at  <dig> nm was measured at different time points and the corresponding cfu calculated by plating serial dilutions of the cultures onto lb agar plates in duplicate.

biofilm plate assay
the ability of selected e. faecalis strains to produce biofilm on flat bottom polystyrene microtiter plates  was tested by following the methodology previously described  <cit> . biofilm plate assay for each of the strains was done in triplicate and repeated twice. statistical comparisons were done by unpaired two-tailed t-tests using a graphpad prism  <dig>  software package . a p-value of < <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

adherence assays
adherence to human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma caco- <dig> cells was investigated using a protocol previously described  <cit>  with slight modifications. caco- <dig> cells between the 15th and 25th passages were cultivated in 24-well plates to a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well for  <dig> to  <dig> days . the monolayers were incubated with a bacterial cell to epithelial cell ratio of 100: <dig>  as well as 1000: <dig> for  <dig> h. after infection of the monolayer, epithelial cells were washed five times with phosphate saline buffer  and lysed with  <dig> % triton-x <dig>  at 37°c for  <dig> minutes. to determine quantitatively the number of attached bacterial cells, lysates were diluted in tsb  and plated onto tsa plates. statistical comparisons of cfu numbers were done by unpaired two-tailed t-tests using the graphpad prism  <dig>  software package .

animal models
different animal models were used for a comparative assessment of the pathogenic potential of the selected enterococcal strains d <dig> and uw <dig>  also, e. faecalis strains v <dig> and og1rf, as well as e. faecium 64/ <dig>  served as controls.

assay of g. mellonella infection
the insect larva g. mellonella is an alternative model for studying bacteria-host interactions, showing a complex immune reaction consisting of both cellular and humoral responses. according to previously described protocols  <cit> , assays were done with some modifications. some  <dig> μl of tsb overnight culture was added to  <dig> ml of fresh tsb medium  and cultured at 37°c for  <dig> h. after centrifugation for  <dig> min at  <dig>  rpm, cell pellets were resuspended in  <dig> ml sterile pbs. cell concentration was photometrically measured and the cell density of the inoculum was adjusted to  <dig> cells/ <dig> μl. groups of  <dig> g. mellonella larvae  with a weight of about  <dig> mg were separated. then,  <dig> μl of the bacterial inoculum was microinjected at the base of the last proleg, corresponding to an infective dose of  <dig> cfu/larvae. a control group of larvae was infected with pbs only. the real infective dose was determined by serial dilution, plated on pbs agar plates. groups of infected larvae were kept per petri dish at 37°c and the number of dead larvae was counted after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. this approach was repeated at least three times for each of the selected strains. using the nominal values of survival and death, the diagram, presenting the death rates, was calculated by kaplan-meier plot method in graphpad prism  <dig>  software version . statistical significance  was determined by the log-rank  test.

murine bacteraemia model
the murine bacteraemia model was used to evaluate the pathogenic potential of the selected e. faecalis strains d <dig> and uw <dig> by analysis of bacterial growth in blood and murine organs  following a methodology described previously  <cit> . in brief, eight female 6-8-week-old balb/c mice  were inoculated intravenously in the tail vein with  <dig> and 5× <dig> cfu respectively and bacterial growth was analysed after  <dig> h post-infection. statistical comparisons were done by mann–whitney tests  using the graphpad prism  <dig>  software package .

accession numbers. the full genome sequence of e. faecalis d <dig> is deposited at genbank numbers nc018221- <dig>  all other scaffolded e. faecalis genome sequences are deposited at jgi’s img/er website  under the accession numbers  <dig> –  <dig> .

RESULTS
pre-characterisation of the st <dig> strain collection
the st <dig> strains were compared for specific phenotypic and genotypic characteristics in order to select representative isolates for genome sequencing. strains were typed by smai macrorestriction in pfge and sub-clusters of closely related strains were identified which were grouped independently of their geographical and temporal origin or clinical/non-clinical context . distribution of phenotypic antibiotic susceptibilities was completed by determination of the corresponding genes by pcr . results were mainly congruent. two discrepancies were detected; one isolate was aade-positive but not streptomycin-high-level resistant and another isolate was aac6’-aph2”-negative but gentamicin-resistant. presence and expression of putative virulence-associated genes encoded within the e. faecalis pai and/or on the chromosome were investigated by pcr and partly confirmed by phenotypic in vitro assays . the pai-associated aggregation substance asc- <dig> gene was found in  <dig> % of the isolates. prevalence of the cytolysin  operon in  <dig> % of the strains was associated with the evidence of β-haemolysis in vitro. the enterococcal surface protein gene esp was detected in  <dig> % of the st <dig> strains. all isolates harboured the gele  and fsr  genes and showed in vitro gelatinase expression .figure  <dig>

presence of putative virulence-associated genes  was examined by pcr. numbers in bold represent percentage of positive tested isolates, calculated from the number of the positive genotypes versus the whole strain collection .



the enterococcal capsule locus  consists of  <dig> known open reading frames, namely cpsa-k. capsule locus type  <dig>  was verified by pcr for all st <dig> isolates.

we also tested the ability of the st <dig> strains to form biofilms on polystyrene plates. biofilm formation was independent of the presence of putative biofilm-enhancing genes like esp and asc- <dig>  and was also inhomogeneous between closely related strains .

results of plasmid isolation in combination with s <dig> nuclease pfge indicated diversity in plasmid content, varying in size and quantity  and plasmid rep type .

genome sequencing
on the basis of previous characterisations, a subset of  <dig> strains , representing the diversity of the st <dig> collection and some pairs of related isolates, was sequenced de novo by roche gs flx  <dig> technology. genomic contigs were generated and assembled by using the newbler assembler software . although in principle suitable for de novo genome assemblies, classical  <dig> sequencing revealed only two strains  with fewer than  <dig> genomic contigs. the calculated genome size varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp. for the majority of the genomes coverage was unsatisfactory . to improve the accuracy and overall quality of the sequencing data, a subsequent workflow was pursued including:  establishing a template for genomic mapping within st <dig> by generating a completely closed chromosome of a reference isolate using long paired end  <dig> kbp libraries and  <dig> sequencing as well as classical sanger sequencing to correct for indel errors; and  additional sequencing of the other  <dig> e. faecalis strains by solexa technology .

generating a reference genome of e. faecalis d32
key parameters of the sequencing, assembly and annotation strategy were described recently as well as standard information regarding numbers of ribosomal genes, coding sequences, etc.  <cit> . additionally to what we have elucidated in this previous announcement, subsequently performed s <dig> nuclease pfge analyses revealed a single ca.  <dig> kb plasmid in strain d <dig>  regarding the two supposedly assembled plasmid contigs of  <dig> and  <dig> kb and the fact that the former plasmid efd32pb did not show any homology with a replicase gene, we postulated an assembly error and suggested the two contigs merge into one single plasmid sequence demonstrating rep <dig> type.

we used a venn diagram presentation generated by the web application edgar to illustrate homologies and differences between the finished and publicly available e. faecalis genomes. it illustrated a common gene pool of  <dig> cds, present in all of the finished e. faecalis genomes . this analysis also revealed that the number of unique cds of the clinical strain v <dig> was approximately twice that of the counts of the commensal isolates  <dig> and our st <dig> isolate d <dig> as well as the probiotic symbioflor  <dig> strain. as a derivate of the commensal isolate, the og1rf strain carried the minimal number of  <dig> unique cds. the commensal strains  <dig> and d <dig> both shared significantly more cds with the v <dig> chromosome, whereas the symbioflor  <dig> and og1rf chromosomes overlapped less with the v <dig> core genome.figure  <dig>

comparative analysis of the e. faecalis st <dig> genomes
de novo sequences, generated by both  <dig> pyrosequencing and illumina/solexa sequencing, were hybrid assembled. this combined sequencing and assembly approach resulted in satisfactory analysis parameters since it improved overall coverage and read length, slightly increased the genome size  and reduced the number of genomic contigs . mapping of the  <dig> st <dig> draft genomes against the d <dig> reference genome suggested a high level of genomic similarity irrespective of the geographical, host, temporal or clinical/non-clinical origin of the isolates . differences between the strains were minor and corresponded to  a different composition of the e. faecalis pai,  differences in phage content and  a putative genomic island first described in d <dig> which is absent in all other st <dig> strains except for another animal isolate, uw <dig>  this genomic island was located at a putative hot spot for integration in the e. faecalis chromosome, since strain v <dig> contained the vanb operon at this site whereas og1rf harboured the myo-inositol operon .table  <dig>

a phylogenetic tree resulting from an alignment of concatenated sequences, present in all analysed strains and after elimination of existing gaps, is shown in figure  <dig>  it revealed a very high level of genomic similarity of unrelated st <dig> strains, despite their diverse origins and the time interval from < <dig> to  <dig>  of note, strains of a similar origin were not arranged in the same clusters. when we focused on the st <dig> isolates, the core-genome based phylogenetic tree also showed an exceptional position of d <dig> in relation to the other sequenced st <dig> isolates and furthermore its close relationship with the other danish porcine isolate uw <dig>  as expected, the completely closed and publicly available e. faecalis genomes branch separately, supporting their assignment to different sequence types and clonal complexes based on mlst. in order to confirm the relationship between the  <dig> e. faecalis st <dig> isolates with respect to their core genome, additional phylogenetic analyses were performed by mapping solexa single reads of  <dig> isolates against the e. faecalis d <dig> reference sequence using a mapping pipeline based on bwa. as enterococci frequently undergo chromosomal rearrangements, we first excluded snps which were owed to recent recombination events. this yielded a total of  <dig> variable positions , which in turn served as the basis for tree reconstruction by the phyml algorithm. the generated tree in additional file 5: figure s <dig> revealed a highly similar structure to the previous one  despite the different input data supporting the reliability of both approaches. both trees revealed exactly identical subclusters of related strains. in additional file 5: figure s <dig> the separate clustering of the two pig commensal strains d <dig> and d <dig> from denmark is highly visible and supported by a high bootstrap value . the separation of the two pig commensal isolates d <dig> and d <dig> based on core genome data disproves the hypothesis of highly related pig and human endocarditis isolates as derived from pfge analysis .figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic relationship among selected

strains based on whole genome alignments. the alignment was calculated with mugsy  and only aligned regions present in all analyzed strains were extracted. these regions were concatenated and positions with gaps removed. the resulting core alignment was used to infer a maximum likelihood tree with raxml. the gtrgamma model for nucleotide substitution and rate heterogeneity was utilized, bootstrap support values of  <dig> replicates are shown at the nodes. names of the st <dig> isolates and their origin are indicated at the end of the branches. the highly related st <dig> isolates were further zoomed in exemplified by the dotted line and the different scale bar. metadata are given as follows: strain no., year of isolation, origin, country: ac, animal colonizer; ai, animal infection; hc, human colonizer; hi, human infection; cu, cuba; d, germany; dk, denmark; es, spain; is, island; pl, poland; usa.



analyses of mobile genetic elements
all isolates featured a modularly structured and differently composed pai, flanked by phage-related integration and excision genes . of note, genome mapping also revealed that the probiotic symbioflor  <dig> strain contains parts of the pai present in d <dig> . however, in this context it is must be noted that the reference isolate d <dig> itself lacks substantial parts of the pai  including a number of virulence determinants such as asc- <dig>  the cytolysin operon and the esp gene. presence of parts of the pai has been confirmed by long template pcrs performed in advance of genome sequencing experiments. it revealed a number of well-known virulence genes in many st <dig> isolates .

genome analyses of the porcine strain d <dig> revealed a previously novel and uncharacterised genomic island with a size of  <dig> kb  integrated at the attachment site of the conjugative vanb transposon in v <dig>   <cit>  and the m-inositol  operon in og1rf, respectively   <cit> . genome analysis of the probiotic strain symbioflor indicated that neither the iol operon of the og1rf nor the vanb transposon of v <dig> nor the uncharacterised genomic island of the d <dig> strain was present  <cit> . further results of bidirectional blast analysis and genome mapping data  revealed that the novel genomic island of d <dig> was only verifiable in uw <dig>  an isolate originating from fish. we used swissprot and blastp analyses to identify similarities to capsule-like genes encoded by genes of the novel genomic island in d <dig>  with similarities to genes and gene clusters described for streptococcus pneumoniae and bacillus subtilis .

prophages. we compared phage content by mapping against the d <dig> reference genome . strain-specific phage patterns were recognised for some of the st <dig> isolates, suggesting that prophage content varied independently of the strain background . for example, d <dig> prophage  <dig>  showing high similarity to the enterococcal phage phifl4a , was also present in uw <dig>  isolated from human urinary tract infection, and in the human colonising strain uw <dig>  in relation to d <dig>  strains isolated from blood culture and bovine mastitis differed in prophage content, whereas the other st <dig> isolates showed a comparably homogeneous level of phage content .

plasmid content and classification
in the context of the  <dig> de novo sequenced strains, investigation of plasmid content indicated a certain level of diversity independently of the strain background. plasmids could be classified by the replication initiating gene repa of the corresponding replicase  families: presence of repa of the well-described e. faecalis plasmids pad <dig>  pcf <dig> and pre <dig> was confirmed by southern hybridisation . additionally, sequencing was used to review these results and to differentiate between the amplified conserved repa alleles of the closely related pad <dig> and pcf <dig>  the most dominant rep families among the sequenced e. faecalis st <dig> were rep <dig>  and rep <dig> , found in three  and six isolates , respectively.

regarding the two crispr loci identified in og1rf, our sequence and pcr results indicated that all of the selected st <dig> genomes possessed the crispr1-cas and crispr <dig> loci, the latter lacking the functional cas genes. an exception is represented by the genome of uw <dig>  where only the crispr <dig> locus was present . our detailed analyses of crispr <dig> loci showed that all strains of the sequenced st <dig> subgroup possessed three identical spacers, whereby two of those were also present in og1rf. in d <dig> where the crispr-cas sequences were completely available, several spacers showed homology with enterococcal phages such as phief <dig>  phifl3a and sap <dig>  being different from prophages found in the genome sequence of d <dig> . the exception was phief <dig> which was present in the genome of d32; however, the phage sequence was incomplete . one spacer in d <dig> was identical to a hypothetical protein plg2- <dig> of e. faecalis plasmid plg <dig> , which is not in conflict with the plasmid in d <dig> which is of rep <dig> plasmid type.

utilisation of carbon sources
we postulated that the different origins and habitats of the isolates might be recovered by minor, host-specific differences in their metabolic properties as described for isolates of e. faecium  <cit> . to determine supposed differences in their metabolic profiles, biolog microarray™ analyses were performed. for reasons of simplification, data values in additional file 2: table s6a and b were replaced by colour codes. utilisation of various carbon sources under aerobic conditions did not show significant differences between the  <dig> sequenced e. faecalis st <dig> isolates. no obvious association between origin or host and utilisation of different carbon sources was detected.

in general, results were in line with carbon utilisation patterns used for species and genus identification or as described previously  <cit> . all strains were capable of growing on trehalose, n-acetyl-glucosamine, glycerol, mannitol, glucose, lactose, sucrose and fructose-6-phosphate. they were all capable of fermenting ribose as a c <dig> sugar, malate  and dihydroxyaceton . no strains grew on melibiose, arabitol and methyl-d-glucoside, as expected. we only noticed a few discrepancies; for instance, according to devriese and colleagues  <cit>  e. faecalis should not ferment l-arabinose, whereas all st <dig> e. faecalis as well as the reference strains v <dig> and og1rf did. utilisation of d-xylose is given as ‘mainly negative’, but all tested strains including our reference strains were positive. reference isolate v <dig> utilised cellobiose, fructose, lactose, glucose, galactose, glycerol, maltose, mannitol, mannose, ribose, sucrose and trehalose as described  <cit> . one of the minor differences noticed was variable utilisation of myo-inositol . belonging to one of nine isomers of the inositol group, m-inositol is used as a sole carbon source by many soil and plant microorganisms through degradation into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate  <cit> . as already described, the novel and uncharacterised genomic island  of d <dig> was integrated at the attachment site of the m-inositol operon in og1rf, which consists of  <dig> genes. biolog microarray™ analyses showed that og1rf, but not v <dig> and d <dig>  was able to utilise m-inositol. for all the other sequenced st <dig> strains, the presence  of the iol operon  could be confirmed by pcr  which was in line with a positive result of m-inositol utilisation in the biolog microarray™ assay .

comparative assessment of the pathogenic potential of closely related e. faecalis isolates
molecular and phenotypic pre-characterisations revealed a high level of similarity between the porcine, commensal d <dig> and a human clinical endocarditis isolate uw <dig>  both from denmark. ability to adhere to human epithelial cells and to cause pathogenic effects in selected animal models was analysed for these two related st <dig> strains.

in vitro growth kinetics
over the course of  <dig> hours, optical density and the corresponding bacterial counts were determined . measurement of the optical density suggested that d <dig> grew faster than uw7709; however, d <dig> also showed a tendency to clump in liquid culture. thus, we also determined the bacterial counts, finding a comparatively similar growth rate of e. faecalis strains d <dig> and uw <dig> 

in vitro biofilm formation
e. faecalis strain uw <dig> showed a significantly enhanced biofilm production compared with strain d <dig> . results of biofilm formation were also compared with the corresponding genotype. genomes of both strains harboured fsrb and gele genes in combination with expression of an active metalloprotease gele. no correlation between the presence of esp or other biofilm-enhancing factors, such as the ebpabc or epa locus, and the in vitro capacity of biofilm formation was detected. the esp gene was absent in both genomes, whereas both genomes harboured the ebp and epa locus.figure  <dig>

discussion
molecular, genomic and phenotypic strain characterisation reveals a high level of similarity among diverse e. faecalis st <dig> isolates
smai macrorestriction patterns in combination with analyses of the presence and expression of the described virulence-associated genes by pcr revealed a high level of similarity among the rather diverse collection of st <dig> isolates . this suggested that strains of this clonal group did not show specific genomic characteristics or differences according to their host, context , time, and geography. the finding that major differences in content mainly derive from a diverse acquisition and composition of the various mge still holds after whole genome sequencing of a subset of  <dig> isolates from this collection . this indicates that genomic variability within clonal types or lineages may be limited, which is in line with previous reports  <cit>  and which does not contradict the general observation of a high level of recombination at the level of enterococcus faecalis species. when we performed an snp-based phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> whole genomes an accumulation of snps in distinct genomic regions  pointed to a certain amount of recombination that most probably accompanied the exchange of mges. however, the exclusion of recombinational snps did not result in a different phylogeny , again suggesting that recombination within clonal lineage st <dig> is minor.

it has been suggested that ‘ecotypes’ defined by specific mobile elements may be identified within high-risk lineages or in lineages with variable crispr-cas status such as st <dig> and st <dig>  <cit> . environmental isolates exemplified acquisition of distinct plasmids conferring additional metabolic features such as raffinose fermentation in e. faecium  <cit> . we did not find any support in a generation of ecotypes or an adaptation to the corresponding origin or host by distinct metabolic features based on genome content which were confirmed by biolog analyses . nevertheless, utilisation of sugars and other carbon sources was only slightly variable and if so, only variable for individual strains independent of their origin. differences in carbon utilization patterns could partly be linked to genome content such as for utilising m-inositol . previous studies concluded that xylose fermentation is limited among e. faecalis in general, since, for instance, none of the  <dig> reference isolates was capable of utilising it  <cit> . in our case, all sequenced e. faecalis isolates were capable of growing on xylose, suggesting a lineage-specific property of st <dig> isolates. recent systemic studies described a model where, in the state of susceptibility to infection by clostridium difficile caused by high antibiotic selective pressure, sugar alcohols are enriched in the gut metabolome  <cit> . bacteria capable of utilising these sugar alcohols may have a definite growth advantage under these specific conditions which is known for e. faecalis and which was dedicated until now to favourable natural and acquired resistances to the used antibiotics. in particular, sugar alcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol increased several hundred-fold under the test conditions and utilisation of these sugars was also strongly positive in all our tested strains . however, this does not seem to be a general property, since although all tested e. faecalis strains were capable of utilising arabinose they were incapable of utilising arabitol. it should be emphasised that biolog analyses in principle detect utilisation of energy sources via respiration and reduction of the tetrazolium dye and thus do not directly detect growth of microorganisms.

in a previous paper we  investigated group d streptococci in cases of bovine mastitis in german dairy cows  <cit> . strains of st <dig> predominated among e. faecalis, emphasising its prevalence as a common and frequent strain type also among dairy cows capable of causing mild and acute clinical cases of bovine mastitis.

our data showed that previously described virulence-associated genes, including fsrabdc-regulated gele, cylm, and esp, as well as clinically relevant antibiotic resistance traits, are also present in st <dig> isolates from non-clinical sources. formation of biofilm  could not be correlated with the presence of described and putative biofilm-associated genes such as esp and asc- <dig>  as mentioned by mcbride et al.  <cit>  all isolates of this most common sequence type st <dig> were non-encapsulated and were also characterised as cps type  <dig> 

differences between the presence and expression of single markers were especially described for the e. faecalis cytolysin and the gelatinase in previous papers  <cit> . we did not notice any discrepancy between the presence of a gene and its expression in our collection of st <dig> e. faecalis strains which was always consistent .

detailed genomic comparisons of  <dig> st <dig> e. faecalis strains identified a modularly structured pai and a novel genomic island in isolate d32
on the basis of our previous characterisations, a subset of  <dig> strains, representing the diversity of the collection, was chosen for de novo pyrosequencing by standard roche  <dig> gs-flx technology. because no complete st <dig> genome sequence was publicly available, we decided to resolve the complete genome sequence of a single pig commensal strain d <dig> for use as a st <dig> template for detailed genome comparisons. after scaffolding with an  <dig> kb long-paired end  library, the remaining gaps and assembly ambiguities  were corrected by sanger sequencing. we gained experience in the use of the two assembly software tools newbler and celera, and generated two and one chromosomal scaffolds, respectively. usage of celera resulted in fewer misassembled regions, whereas the assembly of repetitive sequences was especially difficult for newbler. we generated quite positive experience by using pacbio technology for de novo genome sequencing and assemblies and would favour this approach again for upcoming projects. in brief, we were able to generate a single chromosomal scaffold of  <dig>  mb by using only the pacbio approach  of an e. faecium isolate and by using the hgap algorithm .

in agreement with mcbride et al.  <cit> , we also demonstrated that all of the isolates featured a modularly structured pathogenicity island, varying independently of the strain background and flanked by putative phage-related integrase and excisionase genes  <cit> . the d <dig> pai contained a bile acid hydrolase  and lactose metabolic pathway genes . it lacked the common markers present in the original prototype pai of mmh <dig> which were mainly associated with virulence, like esp, the asc- <dig> gene and the cytolysin operon. in the case of d <dig>  composition of the pai may suggest a putative adaptation to pig’s intestine by the presence of bile acid hydrolase  and the complete lactose metabolic pathway genes . detailed analyses of the genetic components of the pais of the  <dig> e. faecalis st <dig> draft genomes were limited by the existence of intra-chromosomal gaps. however, the presence and absence of pai components/clusters were available from results of long pcr analyses, which showed variability independent from the host . variability is derived from partial or complete mobility of the pai, as demonstrated recently  <cit> . these results again emphasise that the pai evolves through hgt and recombination in a much faster way than the relatively conserved core genome  <cit> .

a so far unknown genomic island was identified as integrated within the genome of the porcine commensal strain d <dig>  apart from several genes with unknown identity, it contains a genomic cluster probably associated with exopolysaccharide synthesis. consisting of different sugars, the extracellular polysaccharides  are polymeric complex structures covalently bound to the cell surface or released in its environment  <cit> . importantly, conserved e. faecalis cell wall polysaccharides are the rhamnopolysaccharide epa, encoded by the enterococcal polysaccharide biosynthesis locus epa, and the capsular polysaccharide cps , consisting of galactose, glucose and phosphate  <cit> . all st <dig> strains were non-encapsulated and are grouped as cps type  <dig>  although the presence of cps genes does not necessarily result in the expression of the corresponding capsule phenotype  <cit> , genes related to cell surface structures are enriched with strains of cc <dig>  <cit> .

investigations regarding the integration site of the novel gi showed that it is integrated within a conserved attl/attr attachment site, previously described as a ‘hot spot’ for rearrangements or new integrations. it is suggested that two different integration events resulted in the presence of an iol operon in og1rf and a conjugative vanb transposon in v <dig>  <cit> . the attachment region is missing in the symbioflor  <dig> strain  <cit> . our sequencing results demonstrated that all of the st <dig> strains, with the exception of d <dig>  harbour an iol operon comparable to og1rf, coupled with identical phenotypes of m-inositol utilisation . m-inositol is a substance abundant in nature and its utilisation was suggested recently as an auxiliary trait promoting fitness in lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacilli  <cit> . genome data in combination with results of biolog microarray™ analyses of the strain uw <dig>  isolated from fish, suggested that the iol operon was co-integrated next to the novel gi. however, the presence of intra-chromosomal gaps within this genomic region limited our opportunities to display the co-localisation in more molecular detail.

resolving the plasmid and phage content and prevalence of genomic islands requires techniques in addition to illumina sequencing
suitable software tools which filter for plasmid sequences, generated by  <dig> or the illumina’s solexa sequencing technology, are limited, as are approaches to identifying entire plasmids from de novo assembled genomic dna. thus, ‘classical’ molecular methods, such as plasmid isolation and analysis of the plasmid size by s <dig> nuclease pfge in combination with pcr- and hybridisation-based rep-typing, were used as more meaningful and informative approaches. in combination with genomic mapping of the st <dig> draft genomes against the d <dig> template, results revealed a comparably high level of diversity in plasmid content  <cit>  and strain-specific phage patterns . integration of bacteriophages might have a significant impact on niche adaptation. duerkop et al.  <cit>  hypothesised that bacteriophages, especially a composition of different bacteriophages, cause bacterial dominance within the microbial ecosystem, where competition for nutrients especially plays a crucial role. integration of the bacteriophage into a promoter region might result in an increase of expression of putative virulence-associated genes  <cit> . surface-exposed wall teichoic acids might be used as specific identification markers for bacteriophages, enabling hgt of virulence and resistance genes across genus-specific barriers of gram-positive pathogens  <cit> .

the rep-typing scheme for determining plasmid types demonstrated that rep-types  <dig> and  <dig> were predominant in the st <dig> strain collection but disclosed also the presence of some new plasmids  <cit> . these results indicated that recombination and rearrangements of chromosomal and other plasmid dna might contribute to mosaic-related structures, whereby an adaptation to changing environmental conditions is mediated  <cit> .

a subset of st <dig> strains has been analysed at a partner’s laboratory by microarray hybridisation analyses of isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium dedicated to detecting specifically mobile genetic elements and resistance genes for another study  <cit> . only isolates of st <dig> harboured possible functional crispr-cas systems which were not detected, for instance, in hospital-associated e. faecalis st <dig> isolates . whereas resistance determinants were evenly distributed among different strains and st types, isolates of st <dig> in particular showed an accumulation of antibiotic, metal and biocide resistance determinants. a link to the presence of corresponding mobile elements such as transposons, conjugative transposons and plasmids frequently carrying these resistance genes was noticeable, suggesting that the presence of crispr-cas is highly specific and does not generally exclude accumulation of resistance determinants or mobile genetic elements as suggested recently  <cit> .

using different in vivo models to analyse adhesion and pathogenicity revealed a higher pathogenic potential of d <dig> in comparison with uw7709
increased adherence to biotic surfaces such as that of d <dig> to caco- <dig> cells  does not necessarily correlate with an enhanced capacity of biofilm formation in vitro , a fact that has been addressed already in previous papers  <cit> . so far described regulators, such as fsr  <cit> , ebpr  <cit> , ebra  <cit> , and pera  <cit> , are suggested to influence biofilm formation and, as demonstrated recently, other genes of the conserved core genome could also be involved in biofilm expression and gene regulation  <cit> .

a number of different in vivo models were utilised to compare the in vivo survival and pathogenic potential of the two related e. faecalis strains d <dig> and uw <dig>  growth in vitro did not differ between these two strains. in the insect larvae galleria model, d <dig> was more rapidly lethal and pathogenicity of d <dig> was generally higher compared with uw <dig> . similar results were generated when recovery rates of bacterial counts were compared for the murine bacteraemia model with significantly enhanced amounts of d <dig> in comparison with uw <dig> isolated from liver, kidneys, spleen and blood . results were confirmed with a rat endocarditis model in a partner’s lab    <cit> . during the course of this study, we tested two other avian models of infection at a partner’s laboratory , which also gave similar results   <cit> . taken together, all used animal models of infection and pathogenicity proclaimed a higher pathogenic potential of the pig isolate d <dig> in comparison with the human endocarditis isolate uw <dig>  obvious differences in the genome content of both isolates mainly included the presence or absence of a few prophage sequences and the novel genomic island in d <dig> potentially encoding a cluster of polysaccharide capsule genes . arguing that this novel genomic island increases pathogenicity of d <dig> in the tested animal models will require targeted knockout experiments by deleting this novel  <dig> kb island in the strain background of d <dig> and subsequent analysis of the behaviour of isogenic strain pairs in the different models; such experiments are planned.

preliminary results of secretome analyses suggested differences in the extracellular proteome of the two related strains d <dig> and uw <dig>  <cit> . differences in the secretome and the above-mentioned putative novel exopolysaccharide cluster could explain why d <dig> in comparison with uw <dig> showed significantly different behaviour in the presented bacteria-host models  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our detailed molecular and phenotypic analyses of  <dig> e. faecalis strains of mlst type st <dig> and the genomic analyses of a subset of  <dig> isolates revealed a minor level of genomic diversity. isolates are highly related regarding the core genome and only demonstrated variable accessory genome content in respect of the presence and composition of the e. faecalis pai, plasmids and phages, independently of their corresponding animal or human background or the context . we were unable to find any indication of niche adaptation associated with the supposed origin or clinical context of distinct st <dig> strains. the animal isolate d <dig>  whose genome was completely resolved during this study, contained a novel genomic island of  <dig> kb, putatively involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis . d <dig> showed enhanced pathogenic potential in various animal models compared with the related human endocarditis isolate uw <dig>  our hypothesis suggests that different behaviour of d <dig> and uw <dig> is associated with the presence of this novel genomic island, a supposition which needs to be proven in future analyses.
