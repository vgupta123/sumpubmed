BACKGROUND
pwd/ph is a highly inbred strain currently at  <dig> generations of brother × sister matings. it originated from the mus m. musculus mouse subspecies by systematic inbreeding of a pair of wild mice trapped in  <dig>  <cit> . the mouse subspecies m. m. musculus and m. m. domesticus diverged from their common ancestor about  <dig> thousand years  <cit>  to  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and at present they display signs of incomplete reproductive isolation  <cit> . as a consequence of the interrupted gene flow between both subspecies, the mice of the pwd/ph strain exhibit a high degree of dna polymorphisms and a broad range of phenotypic differences when compared to classical laboratory strains  <cit> . because of this unique feature, the pwd/ph inbred strain has been nominated among  <dig> mouse strains, the genomes of which are being resequenced using high-density oligonucleotide array technology by perlegen sciences, inc.  <cit> . moreover, pwd/ph serves as the chromosome donor strain in construction of a set of c57bl/6-chrpwd chromosome substitution strains .

bacterial artificial chromosome  genomic libraries are source of large genomic dna insert clones for sequencing projects, physical mapping and isolation of intact genes  <cit> . although bac clones may carry large inserts of genomic dna  they display low rate of de novo rearrangements and are easy to handle. these features are in strong favor of the bac libraries over the yeast artificial chromosome  libraries, which can contain up to 60% of chimeric clones  <cit> . transgenic mice can be generated using bac clones to examine candidate genes in context of all regulatory dna elements required for their function and the phenotype of a mutant mouse can be rescued by bac transgenesis  <cit> . moreover a targeted modification at exact positions within a genomic bac clone can be introduced by recombineering  <cit> .

here we report construction and characterization of the pwd/ph bac library, the first genomic library of the mus m. musculus mouse subspecies. this library together with the upcoming panel of chromosome substitution strains will serve as a tool for analysis of complex traits by taking advantage of the evolutionary divergence between the two closely related mouse subspecies.

RESULTS
construction of the pwd/ph-bac library
the bac library was prepared by cloning the ecori-partially digested genomic dna from the spleen of a pwd/ph female mouse in the vector pbace <dig> . female dna was chosen to gain an unbiased representation of the x chromosome in the library. the primary clones were picked and arrayed in  <dig> individual 384-well plates. the library consists of two segments containing  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig> clones, respectively. together  <dig>  <dig> primary clones were arrayed on eight high-density nylon membranes . the high-density membranes were utilized in subsequent hybridization experiments.

average insert size of the library
the average insert size of the library was determined on a set of  <dig> randomly selected bac clones. dna samples were prepared from  <dig> and  <dig> bac clones from the library segments  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and subjected to noti restriction analysis. the products of the digestion reactions were resolved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  along with the high molecular weight markers. the average insert size for the first and the second library segment was  <dig>  kb  and  <dig>  kb , respectively . in the first and second library segments 6% and  <dig> % clones were observed without insert, corresponding to 97% of insert-containing clones for the entire library. estimation of  <dig> -fold redundancy of the library was based on the average insert size  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp size of the mouse genome.

library screening and bac end sequencing
a probability to find any given unique sequence in the library is  <dig> %, according to the published formula , where p is probability, n is number of clones, i is insert size, and gs is size of genome)  <cit> . to further assess the genome redundancy and possible cloning bias of the library experimentally we performed a screening of the library with  <dig> single-copy gene probes. the probes were designed to amplify pcr products on the pwd/ph genomic dna template . seven probes detected in total  <dig> positive clones by hybridization on  <dig> high-density library membranes,  <dig> to  <dig> clones for each individual probe. the average number of clones recognized by a single probe was  <dig> , in good accordance with the assessment of the library redundancy based on the average insert size.

 <dig> mm <dig> assembly, ucsc

to characterize the inserts of the pwd/ph bac library at the dna sequence level we sequenced and manually edited  <dig> bac ends from  <dig> bac clones . the bac end sequences  were masked for repeats and aligned on the c57bl/6j mouse genome. bes pairs of  <dig> bac clones mapped to unique positions in the b <dig> genome on the opposite dna strands within the distance up to  <dig> kb . the mapping allowed us to estimate the average insert size of the bac clones based on their locations on the b <dig> genome as  <dig> kb, which was slightly higher estimate than the average insert size acquired by restriction analysis . these values corresponded well with the average insert size calculated for another set of clones recovered by the library screening described above . a bes pair belonging to the clone 307-9o mapped to two distinct chromosomes. whether it represents a chimeric insert or a chromosomal rearrangement in the pwd/ph genome remains to be determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization  analysis. for each of the additional  <dig> bac clones we found unambiguous positions for only one bes of a pair. mapping of remaining  <dig> bess was prevented by a high content of repetitive elements.

bac ends  of the positive clones identified on the membranes no.  <dig> and no.  <dig> were sequenced, mapped and aligned to the mouse genome . the coordinates on the mouse genome are shown for the probes as well as for the ends of genomic inserts. an average insert size  <dig>  kb was calculated from mapped positions and  <dig>  kb was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis .

analysis of snps and dna polymorphism
to find out the degree of nucleotide polymorphism between the pwd/ph and c57bl/6j mouse strains, we aligned  <dig> uniquely mapped bess  with their c57bl/6j genomic counterparts and found  <dig> single nucleotide substitutions. the calculated snp rate  <dig>  per  <dig> bp is significantly higher than snp frequency between laboratory strains  <cit>  and corresponds well to the rate between the closely related subspecies mus m. molossinus and the c57bl/6j strain   <cit> . the insertions and deletions  were found with lower frequency than snps: single nucleotide indels occurred with frequency  <dig> % while multinucleotide indels with only  <dig> % frequency. all nucleotide changes observed in the alignments of  <dig> pwd/ph bess and their b <dig> counterparts are summarized in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the high number of snps of the pwd/ph strain is reflected by a high frequency of genetic and phenotypic variations between pwd/ph and b <dig> inbred mice. an initial study performed to compare behavior of the pwd/ph inbred strain with the b <dig> revealed substantial behavioral differences between these two strains  <cit> . using dense snp maps of various laboratory and wild-derived inbred strains  <cit>  it will be possible to map genes responsible for particular complex traits more efficiently. for ultimate validation of candidate genes genomic bac libraries will be highly desirable.

CONCLUSIONS
the first genomic bac library was constructed for the mus m. musculus subspecies of the house mouse, represented by the pwd/ph inbred strain. the quality of the pwd bac library was verified by hybridization with seven unique probes that identified multiple positive clones. bac end sequencing provided a new piece of evidence on the high incidence of snps  between c57bl/6j and pwd/ph inbred strains. the mouse pwd/ph bac library will serve as a tool for functional genomics of complex genetic traits with the ultimate goal to identify and clone responsible genes. the pwd bac library will become accessible to the scientific community via rzpd, berlin, germany  <cit> .
