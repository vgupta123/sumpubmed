BACKGROUND
mice do not develop periodontitis naturally, but experimental periodontitis can be induced by inoculating mice with a periodontal pathogen such as porphyromonas gingivalis  <cit> . experimentally induced periodontitis in mice has served as an animal model for human periodontitis. since periodontitis is caused by a dental biofilm consisting of a complex microbial community rather than a single pathogen, information on the composition of indigenous oral microbiota is important. although the oral microbiota of several mouse strains have been characterized  <cit> , these studies were based on cultivation. in addition, the isolates were identified by phenotypic characterization, including gram staining, the catalase reaction, and commercial biochemical tests such as api strips.

it is now generally accepted that microbial community analysis should be culture-independent and utilize molecular identification methods such as sequencing of 16s rrna genes. the typical procedure for culture-independent dissection of a bacterial community's structure involves the isolation of whole bacterial community dna, amplification of 16s rrna genes, cloning into an escherichia coli host, and sequencing of each cloned amplicon. recently, pyrosequencing, a new high-throughput dna sequencing technique, has been introduced and employed in various microbiological disciplines. pyrosequencing allows over 100-fold higher throughput than the conventional sanger sequencing method. the higher throughput makes it possible to process large numbers of samples simultaneously and also makes it possible to detect rare species  <cit> . the utility of pyrosequencing in the characterization of microbial communities has been well documented for the roche/ <dig> genome sequencer   <dig> machine  <cit>  and the gs flx system  <cit> , which produce sequence reads of approximately  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length, respectively. at the end of  <dig>  a new pyrosequencer called gs flx titanium was developed; it generates fivefold more sequencing reads and an extended read length  compared to the gs flx system. this latest model pyrosequencer has been used for genome sequencing but has not been tested for culture-independent microbial community analysis based on 16s rrna.

the composition of indigenous microbiota seems to be the result of strong host selection and co-evolution  <cit> . the role of the immune system in the selection of indigenous microbiota has been demonstrated in several studies. the total cultivable oral microbiota of athymic nu/nu mice was dominated by enterococcus faecalis, while that of nu/+ mice was dominated by lactobacillus murinus  <cit> . in contrast, b-cell-deficiency had no apparent influence on the indigenous oral microbiota of mice  <cit> . toll-like receptors  are innate immune receptors that recognize microbial molecular patterns and mediate innate immune responses to microbes. tlr <dig> recognizes the bacterial lipoproteins, lipoteichoic acids, and lipopolysaccharides of some bacterial species, including p. gingivalis  <cit> . tlr2-deficient mice clear p. gingivalis infection far more rapidly than control mice and resist alveolar bone loss induced by p. gingivalis  <cit> . however, it is not known if tlr <dig> deficiency affects the composition of indigenous oral microbiota and the colonization of p. gingivalis. to evaluate the effect of tlr <dig> deficiency on oral microbiota, oral bacterial communities of wild-type  and tlr <dig> knock-out  c57bl/ <dig> mice were characterized using a roche/ <dig> gs flx titanium pyrosequencer. to our knowledge, this study presents the first report of a 16s rrna-based survey of a microbial community using the roche/ <dig> gs flx titanium system with >  <dig> bp sequence reads.

RESULTS
collected data
we obtained a total of  <dig>  reads  with an average length of  <dig> bp from the pyrosequencing of pcr amplicons. apparently, the roche/ <dig> gs flx titanium system produced data sets with a longer average length than those generated by earlier models . barcodes embedded in both forward and reverse primers allowed sequencing of multiple dna samples in a single run. in this study, we sequenced eight samples; however, this method could be extended to the multiplexing of hundreds of different samples using 8-bp long barcodes.

after the low quality reads and primer sequences were discarded, the final dataset contained  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig> bp . these results corresponded to  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads per mouse . non-specific short pcr products accounted for a substantial portion of the low quality reads, and gel purification of the pcr amplicons would have increased the number of passed reads. since we only included reads that were longer than  <dig> bp in the final dataset, all analyzed sequences contained at least two of the v <dig>  v <dig>  and v <dig> regions  <cit> .

microbial diversity in murine oral microbiota
each refined pyrosequencing read was first taxonomically assigned by aligning it to the sequences in the eztaxon-extended database, which is a new 16s rrna sequence database that has a complete taxonomic hierarchy for the correct assignment of each sequence read. using this new system,  <dig> % of all analyzed sequences were successfully assigned from the species up to the phylum level. about  <dig> % of all sequences could not be defined at the phylum level, while the rest belonged to  <dig> phyla. among these  <dig> phyla, firmicutes and proteobacteria  encompassed the majority of sequences . the other phyla comprised a minor portion in each mouse . for the phyla cyanobacteria, verrucomicrobia, tenericutes, acidobacteria and planctomycetes, less than five sequences were found in the total analyzed reads. surprisingly, the oral microbiota from captive mice were dominated by only a few thriving species/phylotypes. most of the phylotypes  identified in this study were present at very low levels. the ten most frequently found species/phylotypes represented more than 88% of the oral microbiota in each animal . in particular, streptococcus eu453973_s, which is a tentative species  represented by the genbank accession no. eu <dig>  was the most dominant phylotype in six out of eight mice examined, and represented 59% to 94% of all sequence reads analyzed in each animal. in mouse wt <dig>  streptococcus eu453973_s accounted for only  <dig> % of the total bacteria, and instead of streptococcus eu453973_s, lactobacilli and staphylococci were the dominant bacteria. this finding agrees with the findings of a previous report on the indigenous cultivable oral bacteria of c57bl/ <dig> mice  <cit> . an unidentified streptococcus species has been previously reported to eventually dominate the murine oral microbiota by displacing the other bacterial species. this bacterium was present in mice originating from the jackson laboratory, but not in mice from charles river  <cit> . the c57bl/ <dig> wild-type mice used in this study were purchased from the orient co., which originated from charles river. it is not possible to confirm whether the streptococci observed in the study conducted by marcotte et al.  <cit>  corresponds to streptococcus eu453973_s identified in the present study, due to a lack of sequence data from the previous study. mouse wt <dig> was housed at the laboratory animal facility of our school for only three weeks, whereas the three other wild-type mice were housed for eight or nine weeks in the same room with the tlr2-deficient mice. thus, the microbial community of wt <dig> may represent that of the mice from charles river without the dominant streptococcus species. the effect of the housing environment and the suppliers on the composition of mouse oral microbiota has been previously reported  <cit> .

to determine whether all phylotypes present in the bacterial community were detected in this study, rarefaction analyses were performed. when a phylotype was defined using a threshold of 97% nucleotide sequence similarity,  <dig> to  <dig>  phylotypes were found in each mouse . although the gradients of collector's curves decreased quickly at approximately  <dig> sampled sequences, the number of phylotypes was on the increase even at the highest numbers of sequences sampled . the chao <dig> estimator of species richness in eight mice ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> , representing about 40% higher numbers than those observed in the present study . due to the known sequencing error of the roche/ <dig> technology and the possibility of chimeras, it is fair to say that the numbers of phylotypes calculated in this study are overestimates  <cit> . trudel et al.  <cit>  identified only  <dig> species among  <dig> cultivated bacterial isolates from the oral cavity of balb/c mice. by applying the averaged rarefaction curves of our data sets,  <dig> sampled sequence reads would correspond to  <dig> phylotypes. although the genetic backgrounds of the mice used in these two studies are different, the species diversity of murine oral microbiota determined by the culture-dependent method is only 41% of that determined by the culture-independent method. similarly, over 60% of the  <dig> predominant species detected in the human oral cavity have not been cultivated  <cit> .

interestingly, the estimated species richness of murine oral bacterial flora is far lower than that of humans reported by keijser et al.  <cit> . a direct comparison between the keijser et al. findings and our results is inappropriate because the human data represented pooled samples from  <dig> individuals and was based on very short sequence reads . nevertheless, the relatively low species richness of murine oral microbiota is expected due to the dominance of a small number of bacterial species.

a comparison of oral microbiota from wild-type and tlr2-deficient mice
to evaluate the effect of tlr <dig> deficiency on oral microbiota, the relative abundance of each taxon at the different taxonomic ranks ranging from phylum to species was compared between wild-type and tlr2-deficient animals. the present study has limitation in that the wild-type and tlr2-deficient animals were not subjected to the same environmental conditions during the entire period. nevertheless, a significant difference in the relative abundance was found at the species level for three species of bacteria: staphylococcus sciuri, staphylococcus xylosus, and enterococcus faecalis . the diversity of oral microbiota showed a tendency to increase in tlr2-deficient mice, but this finding was not statistically significant . collectively, the lack of the tlr <dig> protein had a negligible effect on the murine oral bacterial flora. thus, the innate immune response through tlr <dig> seems to be dispensable for maintaining normal oral bacterial flora in mice. wen et al.  <cit>  reported that myd <dig> deficiency in nod mice changed the composition of intestinal microbiota and protected the animals from the development of type  <dig> diabetes, but neither tlr <dig> nor tlr <dig> deficiency protected the animals from the disease. the myd <dig> protein is an adaptor protein used by multiple tlrs including tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  although the intestinal microbiota of tlr2- or tlr4-deficient mice was not analyzed in the previous study, it is likely that a single tlr gene deficiency may not be sufficient to affect the intestinal microbiota, as tlr <dig> deficiency hardly affected oral microbiota.

we observed remarkably similar oral microbial communities in six out of eight animals regardless of their tlr <dig> genotype . this is quite different from human oral microbiota, where significant inter-individual variability has been recognized  <cit> . the low inter-animal variability in murine oral microbiota may be attributed to their inbred genetic background, controlled diet, and specific pathogen-free housing conditions.

a comparison of mouse and human oral microbiota
we successfully analyzed previously published human saliva and plaque samples  <cit>  using our new bioinformatic system for taxonomic assignment. clearly, the human oral microbial communities were more complex than those of the mouse, and the top ten bacterial species/phylotypes represented less than 50% of the oral microbiota in the human samples . only  <dig> species of identified oral bacteria were found to be shared between mice and humans . in particular, mouse wt <dig> contained as many as  <dig> out of the  <dig> bacterial species, although the frequencies of these species were substantially different from those observed in humans. in the other animals, only three to five common bacterial species were identified. these results indicate that the composition of the murine oral microbiota is significantly different from that of humans, which may partly explain why mice do not develop periodontitis. although p. gingivalis-induced periodontitis has served as an animal model for periodontitis  <cit> , p. gingivalis  was not part of the normal murine oral flora. interestingly, the  <dig> bacterial species shared between mouse wt <dig> and the humans included fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola, which are known to be associated with periodontitis  <cit> . whether or not the presence of these human-associated bacteria in the mouse oral cavity affects the colonization of p. gingivalis and susceptibility to p. gingivalis-induced periodontitis warrants further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this study presents the first successful application of the roche/ <dig> flx titanium to 16s rrna-based microbial community analysis. using this new method, the oral bacterial community of captive mice was found to be relatively simple, consisting mainly of a few species in the genera streptococcus, staphylococcus, lactobacillus, halomonas and enterococcus. in addition, the mouse oral bacterial community was not affected by tlr <dig> deficiency. this survey provides a basis for future studies of the role of periodontal pathogens in the murine model of periodontitis.
