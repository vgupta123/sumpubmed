BACKGROUND
clathrin-mediated endocytosis is used for selective internalization of specific plasma membrane proteins, in functions that include nutrient uptake and down-regulation of signaling receptors  <cit> . clathrin provides the structural framework for the coat surrounding internalized vesicles, while a complex array of adaptor proteins are required both for coat formation and for recruiting specific cargo proteins to vesicles  <cit> .

one such adaptor protein, eps <dig>  plays a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . eps <dig> is a modular protein. three n-terminal eps <dig> homology  domains bind npf motifs on a variety of other endocytic adaptor proteins  <cit> . a central coiled-coil domain mediates eps <dig> oligomerization  <cit>  and binding to other proteins including intersectin  <cit>  and the met receptor  <cit> . eps <dig> contains a domain of dpf repeats that bind ap- <dig>  an abundant adaptor protein that links cargo and clathrin  <cit> . two ubiquitin interacting motifs  are located near the c-terminus of eps <dig>  <cit> .

eps <dig> is localized at the rims of clathrin-coated pits  <cit> , and is thought to participate in formation of the clathrin lattice. consistent with this idea, dominant-negative eps <dig> constructs inhibit endocytosis of diverse cargoes, including transferrin receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor   <cit> . furthermore, eps <dig> stimulates the rate of clathrin coat formation by the clathrin adaptor ap <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to this general role in clathrin coat assembly, eps <dig> has a special relationship with egfr and other ubiquitinated endocytic cargo. eps <dig> was originally identified as an egfr substrate  <cit> , and is phosphorylated by egfr on tyr  <dig>  <cit> . overexpression of an eps <dig> mutant lacking this residue blocks endocytosis of the egfr, but not the transferrin receptor  <cit> . although a substantial pool of eps <dig> is constitutively present at the plasma membrane, additional eps <dig> is recruited there in response to egfr signaling  <cit> . uim domain-dependent binding of eps <dig> to egfr and other ubiquitinated proteins at the plasma membrane has been proposed to recruit ubiquitinated proteins to clathrin-coated pits and facilitate their endocytosis  <cit> .

ubiquitin binding by eps <dig> may play another role in endocytosis as well. in addition to binding ubiquitin via uim domains, eps <dig> and other endocytic adaptor proteins  are themselves mono-ubiquitinated  <cit> . these proteins can bind each other via ubiquitin-uim interactions and through other motifs  <cit> , suggesting the existence of a uim-ubiquitin-based protein network at endocytic sites  <cit> . formation of this network could enhance endocytosis by increasing the local concentration of these proteins. in yeast, formation of such a network has been proposed to be the main function of ubiquitin-binding interactions of epsins and the eps15-like protein ede <dig>  <cit> .

eps <dig> can localize to endosomes as well as the plasma membrane  <cit> . eps <dig> is essentially undetectable in endosomes in resting cells  <cit> , but is recruited there following egfr signaling  <cit> . the function of endosomal eps <dig> is not clear, and it is not known how egfr signaling targets the protein there. endosomal recruitment might require tyrosine phosphorylation, either of eps <dig> itself or another egfr substrate. alternatively, as activation of egfr results in ubiquitination and endosomal delivery of the receptor  <cit> , eps <dig> might be recruited to endosomes by binding of its uim domains to ubiquitinated egfr. in either case, it is not known whether endosomal recruitment of eps <dig> requires hrs. hrs, together with its binding partner stam, forms the escrt- <dig> complex that binds ubiquitinated cargo upon its delivery to endosomes, and then passes it on to downstream escrt complexes for eventual degradation in lysosomes  <cit> . eps <dig> can bind hrs  <cit> , but the role of this interaction in egf-dependent endosomal recruitment of eps <dig> is not entirely known. recently, it was found that in c. elegans, escrt- <dig> might be recruited to ubiquitinated cargo at the plasma membrane where it directly interacts with the eps <dig> homolog ehs- <dig>  suggesting a more complex relationship with the endosomal sorting machinery than previously imagined  <cit> .

a novel eps <dig> splice variant named eps15b was recently discovered  <cit> . the n-terminal eh domains present in eps <dig> are replaced by a short unique sequence in eps15b, but the two proteins are otherwise identical. unlike eps <dig>  which is largely restricted to the plasma membrane in resting cells, eps15b is constitutively localized to endosomes, apparently in a complex with hrs  <cit> . eps15b promotes egfr degradation, presumably through ubiquitin-dependent binding to egfr  <cit> .

in this paper, we tested the role of ubiquitinated cargo in endosomal recruitment of full-length eps <dig>  we examined three ubiquitinated proteins that can accumulate in endosomes in the absence of egfr or other tyrosine kinase activity. the first was the egfr family member erbb <dig>  constitutive binding of erbb <dig> to the chaperone hsp <dig> is required for its stability: erbb <dig> is ubiquitinated, internalized by a clathrin-independent pathway  <cit> , and targeted to multi-vesicular bodies  independently of signaling activity when cells are treated with the ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin, which releases hsp <dig> from erbb <dig> and its other client proteins  <cit> . we also examined two hybrid proteins containing membrane-targeting signals linked to plasmid-encoded ubiquitin  <cit> . pm-gfp-ub is initially targeted to the plasma membrane, but accumulates in endosomes following constitutive internalization, while gfp-fyve-ubΔgg is targeted directly to early endosomes via a pip-binding fyve domain  <cit> . we found that eps <dig> was recruited to ubiquitin-rich endosomes in all three cases. recruitment did not require hrs, but did require the uim domains of eps <dig>  together, these results suggest that eps <dig> can be recruited to ubiquitin-rich endosomes via uim-domain interactions.

this behavior is similar to that of epsin, another uim-domain containing endocytic adaptor protein that can be recruited to ubiquitin-rich endosomes  <cit> . however, epsin is only recruited to endosomes when its normal binding to clathrin is prevented  <cit> . by contrast, flag-eps <dig> was recruited to endosomes regardless of expression levels, and without perturbation of other binding interactions, suggesting a physiologically relevant role. thus, recruitment of eps <dig> to ubiquitin-rich endosomes may act as a rheostat, slowing endocytosis and giving the escrt machinery time to process ubiquitinated cargo in endosomes.

RESULTS
flag-eps <dig> is recruited to endosomes in ga-treated sk-br- <dig> cells
erbb <dig> is expressed at high levels on the plasma membrane of sk-br- <dig> breast cancer cells . transfected flag-eps <dig> localized to the cytosol and small puncta in these cells, as expected . ga induces erbb <dig> ubiquitination , internalization, and transport to early and late endosomes and lysosomes, where it can be detected by immunofluorescence  microscopy  <cit> . endosomal accumulation of erbb <dig> is easily detected by immunofluorescence after 4 hours of ga treatment, as a significant proportion of the receptor has either degraded or relocalized from the plasma membrane to endosomes. upon ga treatment of transfected sk-br- <dig> cells, flag-eps <dig> re-localized to endocytic organelles, where it colocalized with internalized endogenous erbb <dig> .

to study this behavior further, we expressed wild-type or mutant flag-eps <dig> in cos- <dig> cells, and examined colocalization with the early endosome marker eea <dig> under various conditions, quantitating the colocalization as described in methods. when expressed alone  or together with gfp , flag-eps <dig> had a fine punctate distribution, as in sk-br- <dig> cells, both with  and without  ga. in agreement with earlier reports  <cit> , very little flag-eps <dig> was present on early endosomes . when flag-eps <dig> was co-expressed with gfp-tagged erbb <dig> in these cells, eps <dig> localization was similar to that in cells co-expressing gfp, with little endosomal localization . however, after ga treatment, both eps <dig> and erbb2-gfp were strongly recruited to endosomes . this required the uim domains of eps <dig>  as a construct lacking these domains  <cit>  did not localize to endosomes even when co-expressed with erbb2-gfp in ga-treated cells . together, these results showed that eps <dig> was recruited to endosomes when ubiquitinated erbb <dig> accumulated there, in a uim domain-dependent manner.

to determine whether the endosomal recruitment of eps <dig> is related to activation of the egfr signaling pathway, we treated sk-br- <dig> cells with either egf or ga for  <dig>   <dig> or 8 hours and looked for an increase in phosphorylated akt or mapk . we found that ga did not affect total mapk levels. as noted previously  <cit> , ga destabilized akt. however, ga did not stimulate phosphorylation of either akt or mapk, suggesting that ga-induced recruitment of eps <dig> to endosomes did not require egfr signaling.

eps <dig> is recruited to endosomes containing pm-gfp-ub
as ga releases hsp <dig> from many proteins  <cit> , it was possible that endosomal recruitment of eps <dig> depended on effects that were independent of erbb <dig>  to provide more direct evidence that ubiquitinated cargo could recruit eps <dig> to endosomes, we examined cells expressing pm-gfp-ub. this construct encodes ubiquitin fused to gfp and to a dually-acylated plasma membrane targeting signal derived from the src-family kinase lyn  <cit> . although pm-gfp-ub is initially targeted to the plasma membrane, it also accumulates in endosomes, probably by ubiquitin-dependent trapping by the escrt machinery following endocytosis . by contrast, pm-gfp, which lacks plasmid-encoded ubiquitin, is not enriched in endosomes. we found that flag-eps <dig> accumulated on endosomes in cells expressing pm-gfp-ub, but not in cells expressing pm-gfp, in a uim-dependent manner .

eps <dig> is recruited to endosomes containing gfp-fyve-ubΔgg
as pm-gfp-ub is initially targeted to the plasma membrane, it was possible that components required for endosomal recruitment of eps <dig> in pm-gfp-ub-expressing cells – or eps <dig> itself - might be transported from the plasma membrane to endosomes together with pm-gfp-ub. for this reason, we next examined gfp-fyve-ubΔgg. this construct consists of ubiquitin  fused to gfp and to the fyve domain of hrs, which targets the protein directly from the cytosol to pip-rich endosomes  <cit> . when co-expressed in cos- <dig> cells, flag-eps <dig> accumulated together with gfp-fyve-ubΔgg on eea1-positive endosomes , providing further support for the idea that eps <dig> was recruited directly to ubiquitin-rich endosomes.

surprisingly, some eps <dig> was recruited to endosomes in cells expressing gfp-fyve itself . we speculate that over-expression of this construct disrupted endosome function by competing with endogenous fyve domain proteins–including hrs–for endosome binding. this would cause accumulation of endogenous ubiquitinated cargo in endosomes, recruiting eps <dig> 

neither high flag-eps <dig> expression nor the flag tag is required for eps <dig> recruitment to ubiquitin-rich endosomes
because gfp-fyve-ubΔgg recruited eps <dig> to endosomes efficiently, without possible complications of delivery from the plasma membrane, we used it in further studies to characterize this recruitment in more detail. we could not detect endogenous eps <dig> by if with our antibodies, and we were concerned that endosomal recruitment of flag-eps <dig> might only occur at high expression levels, after saturation of normal binding interactions. for this reason, we measured endosomal recruitment of flag-eps <dig> in gfp-fyve-ubΔgg-expressing cos- <dig> cells as a function of the level of expression of flag-eps <dig>  colocalization of flag-eps <dig> with eea <dig> did not correlate with eps <dig> expression: flag-eps <dig> was recruited efficiently to endosomes even in cells with the lowest detectable flag-eps <dig> level .

to exclude a possible role for the flag tag in endosomal recruitment of eps <dig>  we showed that mcherry-eps <dig> was also recruited to endosomes in cells expressing either pm-gfp-ub or gfp-fyveΔgg .

the uim domains of eps <dig>  but not the eh or coiled-coil domains, are required for recruitment to ubiquitin-containing endosomes
we next mapped the region of eps <dig> required for recruitment to ubiquitin-enriched endosomes using a series of flag-eps <dig> deletion mutants. flag-eps15-∆i lacks the n-terminal eh domains, while flag-eps15-∆ii is an internal deletion lacking the central coiled-coil domain . flag-eps15-∆iii, flag-eps15-∆iv, and the flag-eps15-∆uim construct used in figures  <dig> and  <dig> are c-terminal truncation mutants: flag-eps15-∆iii lacks most of the dpf-repeat region required for ap- <dig> binding and the uim domains, while both flag-eps15-∆iv and flag-eps15-∆uim lack the uim domains . except for flag-eps15-∆iv, which for unknown reasons was poorly expressed, the constructs were expressed at similar levels in cos- <dig> cells .

we next expressed the eps <dig> constructs together with gfp or gfp-fyve-ubΔgg in cos- <dig> cells and measured colocalization of the eps <dig> proteins with eea <dig>  selected images are shown in figure 3c, and quantitation of the colocalization is shown in figure 3d. flag-eps15-∆i and flag-eps15-∆ii were recruited quite efficiently to endosomes in cells expressing gfp-fyve-ubΔgg, showing that the eh and coiled-coil domains were not essential for endosomal localization . the modest decrease in endosomal recruitment of flag-eps15-∆ii, compared to wild-type eps <dig>  might result from the inability of this construct to oligomerize  <cit> . as uim domains bind ubiquitin with low affinity  <cit> , oligomeric eps <dig> would be expected to bind more strongly to ubiquitin-rich endosomes than monomeric eps <dig>  even if binding occurred only through uim-ubiquitin interactions. by contrast, constructs lacking the uim domains  showed very little gfp-fyve-ubΔgg-dependent endosomal recruitment .

tyr  <dig> is not required for endosomal recruitment of flag-eps15
the egfr phosphorylates eps <dig> on tyr  <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether this modification is required for endosomal recruitment, we co-expressed a non-phosphorylatable eps <dig> mutant, eps15-y850f, with gfp or gfp-fyve-ubΔgg in cos- <dig> cells. in cells expressing gfp, eps15-y850f had the same punctate localization as wild-type flag-eps <dig>  and was not present on eea1-positive endosomes . however, eps15-y850f was efficiently recruited to endosomes in cells expressing gfp-fyve-ubΔgg  as well as those containing activated egfr . this showed that tyrosine phosphorylation on tyr  <dig> is not required for endosomal localization of eps <dig> 

hrs is not required for ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of eps <dig> to early endosomes
hrs can bind eps <dig> in the cytosol and on endosomes. eps15b, which localizes primarily to endosomes even without ubiquitin enrichment, binds hrs in vivo <cit> . furthermore, eps15b localizes to hrs-positive endosome microdomains, suggesting that hrs recruits eps15b to endosomes  <cit> . eps <dig> can also bind hrs  <cit> , though this interaction does not occur at significant levels in cells with normal, low levels of endosomal ubiquitin  <cit> . for this reason, we next suppressed hrs expression with sirna to determine whether hrs were required for ubiquitin-dependent endosomal recruitment of eps <dig>  we first verified that hrs expression was efficiently suppressed  by sirnas targeting two different sequences in human hrs , both in human hela cells  and in cos- <dig> cells . we then co-expressed flag-eps <dig> and gfp-fyve-ubΔgg, in cos- <dig> cells previously transfected with either hrs sirna- <dig> or a control sirna . in agreement with the western blot data , hrs was easily detectable on endosomes in control cells, but not in cells expressing hrs sirna- <dig>  . flag-eps <dig> was recruited efficiently to gfp-fyve-ubΔgg, pm-gfp-ub and erbb2-gfp enriched endosomes even in cells with no detectable hrs, showing that hrs was not required for ubiquitin-dependent endosomal recruitment of eps <dig> . similar results were obtained in cells expressing hrs sirna- <dig> instead of hrs sirna- <dig> . furthermore, hrs silencing did not affect flag-eps <dig> recruitment to endosomes in cos <dig> cells expressing pm-gfp-ub, or in ga-treated sk-br- <dig> cells .

flag-eps <dig> is recruited to endosomes enriched in endogenous ubiquitinated cargo
if endosomal recruitment of eps <dig> is physiologically relevant, it must occur at reasonable levels of endosomal ubiquitin. our finding that flag-eps <dig> was recruited to endosomes in ga-treated sk-br- <dig> cells  showed that artificially high, over-expressed levels of ubiquitinated cargo were not required for this recruitment. as another approach to this question, we took advantage of our finding that hrs was not required for recruitment of flag-eps <dig> to endosomes in gfp-fyve-ubΔgg-expressing cells . as hrs is required for packaging of ubiquitinated proteins into mvbs  <cit> , endogenous ubiquitinated cargo should accumulate on endosome rims upon hrs silencing. for this reason, we next examined the localization of flag-eps <dig> in hrs-silenced cos- <dig> cells. flag-eps <dig> was recruited to endosomes in these cells, but not in control cells , showing that endogenous ubiquitinated cargo was sufficient for this recruitment.

in some early experiments, we noticed that gfp-rab <dig>  expressed to serve as an endosome marker, recruited flag-eps <dig> to endosomes. this recruitment was even more pronounced when flag-eps <dig> was co-expressed with the constitutively-active gfp-rab5q79l mutant . we do not know the basis of this recruitment. however, rab5q79l enhances early endosome function, causing enlargement of endosomes  <cit> , and is likely to delay conversion of early to late endosomes  <cit> . we speculate that this may delay processing of ubiquitinated cargo in endosomes, allowing it to accumulate to levels high enough to recruit flag-eps <dig> 

sirna suppression of eps <dig> does not affect erbb <dig> degradation
eps <dig> might function in endosomes by aiding the escrt- <dig> complex in collecting ubiquitinated cargo for degradation. to test this idea, we examined the effect of eps <dig> silencing on degradation of ubiquitinated erbb <dig>  we chose erbb <dig>  rather than egfr, because eps <dig> affects egfr internalization from the plasma membrane  <cit> . although this effect may be small  <cit> , it makes it harder to determine whether eps <dig> also has a second role in egfr trafficking at endosomes. by contrast, ubiquitinated erbb <dig> bypasses the eps15-dependent step at the plasma membrane, as it is internalized by a clathrin-independent pathway  <cit> . following delivery to endosomes, however, ubiquitinated erbb <dig>  like ubiquitinated egfr, is efficiently packaged into vesicles inside mvbs  <cit> .

roxrud et al. reported that sirna directed against a sequence present in both eps <dig> and eps15b delayed egfr degradation in hela cells, while an sirna that targeted a sequence present only in eps <dig> had no effect  <cit> . we tested an sirna that targeted a sequence present in both eps <dig> and eps15b  <cit> , used previously by others to suppress eps <dig> expression  <cit> . this sirna suppressed expression of full-length  eps <dig> by about 80% in sk-br- <dig> cells . we could not reproducibly detect the 120 kda eps15b band on western blots of lysates from a typo for sk-br- <dig> or cos- <dig> cells using our antibodies, so we could not assess the efficacy of eps15b silencing . nevertheless, silencing eps <dig> did not affect erbb <dig> degradation in ga-treated sk-br- <dig> cells  and eps <dig> expression was not affected with ga treatment .

gfp-fyve-ubΔgg slows endocytosis of egfr and transferrin receptor
our current working model is that eps <dig> recruitment to ubiquitin-rich endosomes may function to sequester the protein away from the plasma membrane. this might provide a feedback mechanism, slowing clathrin-mediated endocytosis when high amounts of ubiquitinated cargo were delivered to endosomes. this could provide time for the escrt machinery to clear the ubiquitinated proteins, preventing excessive over-accumulation in endosomes. as a preliminary test of this idea, we measured internalization of endogenous egfr and transferrin receptor in sk-br- <dig> cells expressing gfp-fyve-ubΔgg. we first found that steady-state levels of both receptors at the plasma membrane were similar in gfp-fyve-ubΔgg-expressing and control cells . however, gfp-fyve-ubΔgg expression slowed internalization of both af-594-transferrin  and anti-egfr antibodies . quantitation is shown in figure 6c and f. interestingly, ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of eps <dig> to endosomes affected the rate of transferrin receptor and egfr endocytosis, but not cell surface levels. it is possible that receptor recycling might partially compensate for an altered internalization rate. it is also possible that we could not measure a small increase in plasma membrane levels of these receptors. because of membrane infoldings and uneven morphology, quantitation of plasma membrane fluorescence may be slightly less accurate than that of internalized material.

this result is consistent with our model that ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of eps <dig> to endosomes might slow endocytosis by reducing the amount of the protein at the plasma membrane. however, much further work will be required to fully support this idea. it is important to note that gfp-fyve-ubΔgg overexpression might have other unanticipated effects on endosomal dynamics, possibly by interfering with normal endosome funtion, that could contribute to the observed inhibition of endocytosis secondarily. furthermore, eps <dig> may not be the only clathrin coat accessory protein whose recruitment to endosomes might contribute to inhibition of endocytosis. endosomal ubiquitin could also recruit other ubiquitin-binding accessory proteins, further inhibiting endocytosis.

discussion
it is not known how eps <dig> is recruited to endosomes in response to egfr signaling  <cit> . as egf stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor itself, of eps <dig>  and of other substrates, and also leads to egfr ubiquitination, any of these events might recruit eps <dig> to endosomes. it is also not known whether the endosomal eps <dig> binding partner hrs is required for this recruitment.

in this paper, we showed that eps <dig> was recruited to endosomes enriched in ubiquitinated cargo. recruitment did not require eps <dig> tyr <dig>  which is phosphorylated by egfr, or hrs, but required the uim domains of eps <dig>  furthermore, eps <dig> showed uim-domain-dependent recruitment to novel ubiquitin-rich plasma membrane clusters. together, these findings suggest that binding of eps15’s uim domains to ubiquitin can determine its localization in the cell, and that egf treatment can recruit eps <dig> to endosomes by causing ubiquitinated egfr to accumulate there.

unlike eps <dig>  eps15b is constitutively present on endosomes  <cit> . eps15b binds hrs and colocalizes with hrs in microdomains on endosomes. roxrud et al. suggested that while eh domain interactions and ap- <dig> binding target eps <dig> to the plasma membrane, eps15b is targeted to endosomes by binding to hrs  <cit> . in contrast, mayers et al. recently found that binding of the c. elegans homolog of human eps <dig>  ehs- <dig>  bound to hrs via the eh domains located on the amino terminus of the protein  <cit> . taken together, this suggests the uim-dependent, hrs-independent targeting of eps <dig> to ubiquitin-rich endosomes that we observed occurs by a different mechanism than constitutive, hrs-dependent endosomal targeting of eps15b.

our findings on ubiquitin-dependent eps <dig> targeting are very similar to behavior of epsin reported previously by chen and decamilli  <cit> . as we found for eps <dig>  epsin could be recruited to endosomes or other cellular sites in response to ubiquitin accumulation, in a uim-dependent manner. however, behavior of the two proteins differed in one key way. epsin, unlike eps <dig>  binds directly to clathrin  <cit> . epsin was only recruited to ubiquitin-enriched endosomes when clathrin binding was prevented, either by mutation of epsin or silencing of clathrin  <cit> . by contrast, we found that intact eps <dig> was readily recruited to ubiquitin-rich endosomes. both eps <dig> and epsin have multiple binding partners at the plasma membrane, and these interactions probably counteract uim-dependent targeting to endosomes, as shown for clathrin binding by epsin  <cit> . eps <dig> localization is also probably determined by the balance of affinities for its various binding partners. however, our results suggest that uim domain interactions are more likely to prevail in determining localization of eps <dig> than of epsin. although the affinity of individual uim domains for ubiquitin is low  <cit> , eps <dig> can form dimers and tetramers via its coiled-coil domain  <cit> . thus, increasing the local concentration of ubiquitin should greatly increase the avidity of eps <dig> oligomers for ubiquitin-rich sites. our results suggest that this is enough to recruit eps <dig> to ubiquitin-rich endosomes. thus, ubiquitin-dependent targeting appears to occur more easily for eps <dig> than for epsin, and may be more likely to play an important physiological role.

in this context, a significant question is whether the ubiquitin-dependent recruitment we observed occurs at physiological levels of eps <dig>  this is an especially important concern because all our experiments were done using over-expressed eps <dig> constructs. it is possible that overexpressed eps <dig> might saturate its normal plasma membrane binding partners, artificially creating a pool available for recruitment to endosomes. for this reason, we carefully examined endosomal recruitment in cells expressing the lowest detectable level of flag-eps <dig> . we saw the same recruitment of flag-eps <dig> to ubiquitin-rich endosomes at all levels of flag-eps <dig> expression, suggesting that endosomal recruitment is not an artifact of overexpression.

several functions for endosomal recruitment of eps <dig> can be imagined. one obvious possibility is to aid the escrt- <dig> complex in processing ubiquitinated cargo for degradation. this could occur by direct binding of eps <dig> to ubiquitinated cargo, and/or by establishment of a ubiquitin-dependent protein network analogous to that at the plasma membrane  <cit> . our finding that eps <dig> silencing did not affect erbb <dig> degradation  argues against this possibility, and suggests that eps <dig> is not uniquely required for degradation of ubiquitinated cargo. however, our findings do not exclude this possibility. eps <dig> overlaps functionally with the related adaptor eps15r and epsin at the plasma membrane  <cit> . eps15r, and possibly even epsin, might be recruited to endosomes to substitute for eps <dig> after its silencing.

roxrud et al. found that silencing of eps <dig> with an sirna that spared eps15b did not affect egfr degradation. by contrast, an sirna targeting a sequence present in both eps <dig> and eps15b delayed egfr degradation  <cit> . these results suggested that eps15b, but not eps <dig>  participates in egfr degradation. the sirna that we used was directed against a sequence present in both eps <dig> and eps15b. thus, our results appear to contrast with those of roxrud et al.  <cit> . however, we could not reproducibly detect eps15b on western blots, probably because of the cell types and/or anti-eps <dig> antibodies we used. thus, we could not tell how well our sirna suppressed eps15b expression. roxrud et al. reported more efficient suppression of eps <dig> than eps15b, despite using sirna that targeting a shared sequence  <cit> . if the same were true for the sirna we used, sufficient eps15b might have remained to aid in erbb <dig> degradation.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we show for the first time that ubiquitin alone is sufficient for eps <dig> recruitment to endosomes. although the function of this targeting remains unclear, our findings suggest the following possibility. extensive delivery of ubiquitinated cargo to endosomes might saturate the escrt machinery, causing accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins on the limiting membrane. sequestration of eps <dig> away from its normal site of action at nascent clathrin-coated pits might slow endocytosis, providing time for the escrt complexes to catch up and package cargo into the mvb interior in an orderly fashion.
