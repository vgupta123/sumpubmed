BACKGROUND
low iron bioavailability is a common feature of ocean surface water and alkaline soils, and the mechanisms of iron uptake and metabolism have been thoroughly studied in photosynthetic organisms. the unicellular alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an excellent model for investigations of the crucial mechanisms involved in the uptake of iron and other important metals, and in the physiological response to iron deficiency in unicellular photosynthetic organisms  <cit> . the main iron uptake system of c. reinhardtii is a reductive system, very similar to that described in yeast: a plasma membrane reductase  mediates the reductive dissociation of extracellular ferric complexes, and iron is taken up by channeling through a permease  associated with a multicopper oxidase  that re-oxidizes iron during its uptake . the best-studied model land plant is arabidopsis thaliana, which also uses a reductive system , but takes up iron as ferrous ions without concomitant copper-dependent re-oxidation, via zip family proteins  . finally, graminaceous plants can take up iron non-reductively , through the excretion of phytosiderophores , but other high-affinity mechanisms for iron uptake likely also occur in these marine organisms, several species of which have no ferrireductase activity  <cit> . evidence is emerging for the existence of siderophore-independent, nonreductive iron uptake systems able to take up hydrated ferric species without prior reduction. a protein widely expressed by marine phytoplankton  was recently shown to participate in such a system, by concentrating ferric iron at the cell surface  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms involved in iron uptake by marine microalgae and, more generally, the precise mechanisms of cell adaptation to iron scarcity in the marine environment remain very poorly understood, particularly for the green algal lineage.

the cosmopolitan marine microalga ostreococcus tauri is an ancient member of the green algal lineage . several of its features make it a very good model for studying physiological and genetic aspects of the adaptation of the green algal lineage to the marine environment. this microalga is the smallest eukaryotic organism described to date, it has a very compact genome  <cit> , is easy to culture in laboratory conditions, and can be genetically manipulated by efficient homologous recombination  <cit> . we have shown that this species has no inducible ferrireductase activity at the cell surface  <cit> , and that it uses ferritin to recycle intracellular iron as a function of the day/night cycles  <cit> . ferritin  also seems to be involved in iron uptake in this species, because a ∆ftn mutant was found to have impaired iron uptake  <cit> . surprisingly, an analysis of the genomes of o. tauri and o. lucimarinus provided no clues to the iron-uptake mechanisms used by these species  <cit> .

we investigated iron homeostasis in o. tauri by evaluating the short-term and long-term adaptive responses of this species to iron deprivation by rna sequencing  in combination with physiological assays. we paid particular attention to the transcriptional response of cells to iron deprivation according to the day/night cycles, as previous studies had reported an orchestration of the transcription of biological processes around these cycles in o. tauri  <cit> . our aim in this work was to identify clusters of genes displaying tightly orchestrated temporal expression patterns following the exposure of cells to iron deprivation and day/night cycles. we also aimed to compare the cellular response to iron deprivation in two green algae, o. tauri and c. reinhardtii, based on the extensive work of urzica et al. on c. reinhardtii  <cit> . we found that the genes involved in iron uptake and metabolism were mostly regulated according to the day/night cycles  <cit> . we further found key differences in iron metabolism between o. tauri and c. reinhardtii, leading us to conclude that these two species do not use the same iron uptake system and do not respond in the same manner to changes in iron nutritional status. the transcriptional response of o. tauri to iron deprivation was unique within the green alga lineage. we therefore propose the use of this species as a new model for studies of iron metabolism in eukaryotic phytoplankton.

RESULTS
global transcriptomic analysis reveals that iron homeostasis is tightly coordinated by day/night cycles
we used rnaseq to obtain a genome-wide view of the cellular response of o. tauri to iron deprivation. as we aimed to investigate the fundamental aspects of iron metabolism in o. tauri, we defined two different sets of experiments . in one set of experiments , we analyzed the transcriptome of the cells shortly  after shifting the cells to iron-rich and iron-deficient conditions during the day and during the night . these experiments were designed to characterize the short-term response of cells subjected to sudden and massive changes in iron availability. in a second set of experiments , we carried out a series of transcriptome analyses over a 24-h period  after the cells had been allowed to adapt to iron-poor or iron-rich conditions for one week . these experiments were designed to characterize the long-term adaptive response of cells to changes in iron concentration. all experiments were conducted in triplicate and we applied a dedicated bioinformatics framework for analysis of the rnaseq results . in total, we sequenced, analyzed and combined the results from  <dig> mrna samples from algae grown in  <dig> different sets of growth conditions . this is, to our knowledge, the largest time-course transcript profiling study ever performed in o. tauri.fig.  <dig> global analysis of changes in mrna abundance. gene expression data for all genes and all samples were analyzed by pca. pca is a well-established technique in multivariate statistics. the general principle is to determine new coordinate systems such that the first coordinate explains the maximal amount of variance in the data and successive coordinates explain maximal remaining variance whilst being orthogonal to the first  <cit> . a barplot showing the variability accounted for by each pca component. components  <dig> and  <dig> accounted for  <dig> and 22 % of the global variance, respectively. components  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> accounted for  <dig>   <dig> and 5 % of the global variance. biplots representing the rnaseq samples on the coordinate systems defined by pca components  <dig> and  <dig> , pca components  <dig> and  <dig>  and pca components  <dig> and  <dig> . b plots of logfc values calculated with gene expression measurements for light and dark samples  or for –fe and + fe samples . points represent genes. positive logfc values on the x-axis indicate higher levels of gene expression in the light than in the dark,, whereas positive logfc values on the y-axis indicate higher levels of gene expression –fe than in + fe conditions. the  <dig> genes selected for further characterization are shown in purple 



our rnaseq samples describe the transcriptome states of o. tauri associated with three different factors: i) iron deprivation or excess , ii) day or night , and iii) short- or long-term adaptive responses of the cells  . we first quantified the influence of these factors on the global variability observed in our rnaseq results. we carried out principal component analysis  on the complete gene expression dataset . we found that the percentage of the variance decreased rapidly with increasing principal component  number, with more than 95 % of the total variance accounted for by only five pcs . this analysis identified the key factors affecting gene expression. in particular, pc <dig> and pc <dig>  which accounted for 55 % of the variance, define a coordinate system in which samples are clearly grouped according to light/dark, whereas pc <dig> and pc <dig>  define a coordinate system in which samples are grouped according to experimental conditions  . the iron nutritional status also had an impact on gene expression  but of a lesser magnitude than that of the other factors. the expression of genes regulated by iron nutrition is thus strongly affected by day/night cycles, particularly in condition  <dig>  in which cells were allowed to adapt to low/high levels of iron over several day/night cycles. it has been shown that the transcription of genes involved in biological processes in o. tauri is organized principally around day/night cycles under standard growth conditions  <cit> . we show here that the light/dark factor retains its predominant position under conditions of iron stress, suggesting that iron homeostasis is regulated according to the day/night conditions.

transcriptional regulation in response to iron deprivation is a robust cellular process that can be maintained for extended periods
among the genes for which expression data were available, we identified those displaying significantly different levels of expression in conditions of iron deprivation  and iron excess . we used the deseq program  <cit>  to identify differentially expressed genes and to calculate a risk of error . the numbers of genes with a p-value < 1 % and a logfc >  <dig>  or logfc < − <dig>  in each condition are shown in additional file 3: figure s3a. we found that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were downregulated in condition  <dig> and condition  <dig>  respectively, and that this downregulation was mostly specific to the experimental conditions used, consistent with the pca results . however, a different situation was observed for upregulated genes. we found that  <dig>  genes were upregulated after a prolonged period of cell adaptation to iron deficiency , whereas only  <dig> genes were upregulated after short-term iron stress , with most of the genes  upregulated in condition  <dig> also being upregulated in condition  <dig>  thus, genes induced less than 6 h after the shift to iron-deficient conditions were generally still induced after one week of adaptation to iron shortage , highlighting the robustness of the cellular response to iron stress.

iron metabolism in o. tauri involves many new proteins and pathways that remain to be discovered
we defined a set of genes including i) genes differentially expressed in a least two conditions, and ii) genes differentially expressed in only one condition but for which interesting functions were retrieved . for that, we developed a dedicated process for inferring gene function, combining information from multiple web resources  and systematic manual inspection of the retrieve predictions . we then defined  <dig> general functional categories  and used them to classify  <dig>  genes . this list of genes, together with detailed information including function, subfunction and database search results, is presented in additional file 4: data sets  <dig>  the data corresponding to all o. tauri genes are presented in additional file 5: data sets  <dig>  functions associated with the up- and downregulated genes are shown in fig.  <dig>  in condition  <dig>  about two thirds of the upregulated genes belonged to the “regulatory” , “unknown”  or “stress and redox response”  functional groups. the p-values associated with the functional enrichment of genes were calculated  and the result was highly significant for the “regulatory” function  and particularly for the “zinc-containing proteins” subfunction . the genes rapidly downregulated by iron deprivation were particularly remarkable in terms of their highly significant enrichment in the function “development and growth” , including the “ribosome-related” subfunction . these data suggest that the early response of cells to iron deprivation involves the recruitment of a large number of regulatory proteins  and a decrease in protein synthesis through repression of the translational machinery. this decrease in translation is consistent with the observation that iron limitation decreases the total amount of protein per cell as well as cell size  <cit> . the massive recruitment of zinc-containing proteins  raises questions about the link between zinc and iron in o. tauri . condition  <dig> led to the differential expression of many more genes and the range of functional categories for upregulated genes was broader than for condition  <dig> . in addition to the functional enrichments already observed in the early response , functional enrichments  were observed for the functions “metabolism” , “photosynthesis” , “surface”  and “heme/chlorophyll” . most of the genes downregulated by iron deprivation were associated with the functions “development and growth” , “carbon metabolism” , and “surface” . these data are consistent with the metabolic remodeling expected during the adaptation of cells to iron limitation. surprisingly, 25 % of the downregulated genes were assigned to the functional category “unknown”, a percentage much higher than would be expected by chance alone . as proposed by urzica et al.  <cit> , these proteins can be considered “pioneer proteins”, because they contain no domains suggestive of a particular function. overall, such pioneer proteins accounted for 18 % of the genes displaying up- or downregulation by iron. this very high value strongly suggests that iron metabolism in o. tauri involves more currently unknown proteins and pathways than that in other model organisms of the green plant lineage, such as c. reinhardtii  <cit>  and a. thaliana  <cit> .fig.  <dig> functional categories associated with the genes up- and downregulated in response to iron deprivation. pie charts representing the  <dig> functional categories defined in this work , with the percentage of genes assigned to each function. only the functions for which the calculated enrichment p-value <  <dig>  are noted.  indicates a p-value <  <dig> ,  indicates a p-value <  <dig> ,  indicates a p-value <  <dig>  and  indicates a p-value <  <dig> 



the green algae o. tauri and c. reinhardtii display fundamental differences in iron metabolism
in a previous study, urzica et al.  <cit>  surveyed the iron nutrition-responsive transcriptome of c. reinhardtii with rnaseq technology. we carried out a genome-wide comparison of the transcriptional programs involved in iron metabolism in o. tauri and c. reinhardtii by collecting the rnaseq data from the work of urzica et al.  <cit>  and inferring orthology relationships between all coding sequences of o. tauri and c. reinhardtii . surprisingly, we found that many proteins of functional importance in the metabolism of iron by c. reinhardtii had no orthologs in o. tauri, or that the orthologs of these proteins in o. tauri were not affected by iron nutrition in our dataset . this was the case, for example, for the target genes studied by urzica et al.  <cit>  vtc <dig> and mdar <dig> , cdg <dig>  and the homolog of the brutus gene of a. thaliana . these genes encode proteins thought to play important roles in iron metabolism in green plants, but their homologs in o. tauri  are not regulated by iron , although we cannot exclude the possibility that these genes could be regulated at the post-transcriptional level in o. tauri. these fundamental differences between the two green algae were confirmed by measurements of the growth rates of the two species in media containing a gradient of iron and copper concentrations . o. tauri cells reached maximal growth rates at iron concentrations two orders of magnitude lower than those for c. reinhardtii, and copper supplementation improved the growth of c. reinhardtii, but not that of o. tauri cells .

like most organisms, o. tauri and c. reinhardtii regulate their iron uptake systems as a function of iron availability, but we found that they did not regulate their uptake systems for ferric and/or ferrous iron in the same way following a rapid decrease in the iron concentration of the medium . o. tauri had very low levels of ferrireductase activity , as previously reported  <cit> , that were not induced by iron deprivation in any condition . in c. reinhardtii, the induction of ferrireductase activity was maximal about five to six days after the shift to iron-deficient conditions . unlike ferrireductase activity, iron uptake  by o. tauri was induced shortly after the cells were shifted to iron-deficient conditions , and ferrous, but not ferric iron uptake was further induced subsequently, after more than one week of iron deprivation . in c. reinhardtii, both ferrous and ferric iron uptake activities were maximally induced, together with ferrireductase activity  <cit> , after a few days of growth in iron-deficient conditions . the observation that o. tauri cells can induce iron uptake from a ferric iron source  without the parallel induction of a ferrireductase system suggests that this organism, unlike c. reinhardtii, can take up iron without prior reduction, as recently demonstrated for the diatom p. triconutum  <cit> .fig.  <dig>

iron metabolism in green algae: clues from comparative transcriptomics in o. tauri and c. reinhardtii
o. tauri lacks the classical components of a reductive iron uptake system
in c. reinhardtii, the inducible ferrireductase fre <dig> is involved in iron uptake  <cit> , and another putative ferrireductase  induced by iron starvation is thought to function in intracellular iron metabolism  <cit> . the o. tauri ferrireductase homolog  was strongly expressed  of  <dig> ) but was slightly repressed by iron deprivation, and would therefore not be expected to play a major role in iron uptake . however, two cytochrome b <dig> homologs  were significantly upregulated by iron deprivation , although their levels of expression were low , and these two genes were induced only after prolonged growth in iron-deficient conditions  incompatible with the rapid upregulation of ferrireductase activity in organisms using a reductive uptake system  <cit> . however, cytochrome b <dig> is known to have ferrireductase activity  <cit>  and we cannot rule out the possibility that these genes participate in iron uptake in some way. in c. reinhardtii, two cytochrome b <dig> family proteins containing a domon domain are thought to function as ferrireductases: tef <dig> may be required for reductive iron use by the mitochondria, whereas cre <dig> g <dig> may be located at the plasma membrane  <cit> . the o. tauri cytochrome b <dig> homolog ostta04g <dig> has a similar domain organization and is predicted to be mitochondrial . the second cytochrome b <dig> homolog  has no domon domain and its location within the cell is unknown. this protein displays greater sequence similarity to a different cytochrome b-561-like protein  of c. reinhardtii that does not appear to be regulated by iron  <cit>  . as no inducible ferrireductase activity was found in o. tauri cells , cytochrome b <dig> proteins may be involved in intracellular iron use rather than in iron uptake.table  <dig> effect of short-term  and long-term  iron deprivation on abundance of rnas encoding proteins of various functions

zinc seems to play an important role in regulating iron uptake, but there is no clear iron-copper connection in o. tauri
the copper-dependent re-oxidation of iron during its uptake is a key feature of the iron-copper connection in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . however, the copper dependence of iron uptake in o. tauri is less marked than that in yeast and c. reinhardtii. there was no growth defect in the absence of added copper , and the iron uptake rates of cells grown in copper-free mf medium and cells grown in mf medium supplemented with copper  were not significantly different . the putative copper transporter ostta04g <dig>  was unaffected by iron limitation . this suggests that iron and copper metabolisms are not tightly connected in o. tauri. the closest o. tauri homolog to the c. reinhardtii multicopper oxidase fox <dig>  has a different domain organization . this gene was only weakly expressed  and was not significantly induced by iron deprivation . finally, there is no clear homolog of ftr <dig> in o. tauri . the classical components involved in the inducible reductive iron uptake system  are therefore lacking in o. tauri, as previously reported  <cit> . interestingly, as suggested above, zinc seems to play a more important role than copper in iron uptake in o. tauri. we depleted o. tauri cells of zinc, by growing them in mf medium with no added zinc for 3 months and compared iron uptake kinetics between zinc-replete and zinc-deprived cells. zinc-deprived cells displayed a deregulation of iron uptake, with higher rates of iron uptake than in control cells when the cells were grown in iron-rich medium , and lower iron uptake rates than control cells when the cells were grown in iron-depleted medium  . consistent with our transcriptomic data , this result suggests that zinc plays a more important role in the regulation of iron uptake in o. tauri than in other green lineage organisms  <cit>  or yeast  <cit> .

iron uptake may be mediated by a zip-family protein  and a new fea1-related protein  containing duplicated fea <dig> domains
other important proteins involved in iron uptake and intracellular iron trafficking in plants and in c. reinhardtii are the zip family transporters irt and nramps, which are widely conserved from bacteria to humans  <cit> . we found six genes encoding zip family transporters in o. tauri, two of which were found to be regulated by iron: ostta06g <dig> and ostta16g <dig> . the transcript abundance of ostta06g <dig> was very low , and thus the product of ostta16g <dig> , which we denote ot-irt <dig>  is likely to be the only zip protein playing a significant role in iron metabolism in o. tauri . this protein is predicted to be located at the plasma membrane and, interestingly, contains the motif ghghghghghg, which is similar to the iron-binding motif found in a. thaliana irt <dig>   <cit> . moreover, ot-irt <dig> is more enriched in his residues than at-irt <dig>  and contains two additional his-rich motifs in the hydrophilic parts of the protein that are not present in at-irt <dig> , suggesting higher iron-binding capacity of ot-irt <dig> as compared to other irt proteins in the green lineage. the corresponding gene was particularly strongly induced in the middle of the day after prolonged adaptation to iron deficiency , consistent with our previous observation that the ferrous iron uptake capacity of o. tauri cells peaks in the middle of the day  <cit> .

as we showed experimentally that o. tauri has iron uptake systems for both ferric and ferrous iron and that these systems are induced under iron starvation , it is reasonable to assume that genes encoding components of these iron uptake systems would be among those most strongly induced by iron limitation in experimental condition  <dig> and/or condition  <dig> . one of the most strongly induced genes in all iron-deficient conditions and one of the most strongly expressed genes overall  was ostta18g <dig> . hmm-based comparison clearly indicated that this protein was related to the c. reinhardtii fea1/ <dig> proteins . this newly discovered o. tauri gene  has a duplicated fea <dig> domain, a signal peptide  and a c-terminal transmembrane helix  . interestingly, the n-terminus of ot-fea <dig> is unrelated to fea <dig> itself, and this n-terminal region, which is absent from cr-fea <dig>  may confer properties different from those of the “regular” fea proteins of c. reinhardtii . moreover, the ot-fea <dig> protein contains several motifs thought to play a key role in iron transport by fungal ftr <dig> proteins  <cit> : r/k-e/d-x-x-e and r/k-e-x-x-e/d. ot-fea <dig> contains three such motifs, which are absent in crfea <dig> .

the role of fea <dig> in iron uptake by c. reinhardtii remains a matter of debate  <cit> , but we recently described a new protein with a c-terminal fea <dig> domain  that plays an important role in ferric iron uptake by diatoms  <cit> . a phylogeny of homologous fea <dig> and isip2a domains from algal proteins is shown in fig.  <dig>  the ot-fea <dig> n- and c-terminal domains are monophyletic with the fea <dig> domains of other green algae. multiplication of the fea <dig> domain has clearly occurred on several independent occasions, with the detection of an even number of domains ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . mass spectrometry analysis of iron-containing proteins in o. tauri led to the identification of ot-fea <dig> with a very good score as one of the proteins that are loaded with iron in o. tauri cells . based on this finding and those of our previous study on isip2a  <cit> , we suggest that ot-fea <dig> plays a major role in iron uptake  by o. tauri. the levels of this protein were also correlated with the effects of different growth conditions on iron uptake: protein abundance was maximal in cells grown in iron-deficient conditions, and zinc deficiency  also increased ot-fea <dig> levels , consistent with an effect of zinc on iron uptake .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of ot-fea <dig>  the newly discovered o. tauri gene  has a duplicated fea <dig> domain , a signal peptide  and a c-terminal transmembrane helix . a phylogeny of homologous fea <dig> and isip2a domains from algal proteins is shown. the ostta18g <dig> n- and c-terminal domains are monophyletic with the fea <dig> domains of other green algae. the multiplication of the fea <dig> domain clearly occurred several times independently and even number of domains, from  <dig> to  <dig> is generally detected

iron is mostly stored in the form of low-molecular weight compounds, rather than ferritin
ferritins probably play different roles in c. reinhardtii and o. tauri and are not regulated in the same way in these two species  <cit> . the fundamental difference between the roles of the ferritin proteins in c. reinhardtii and o. tauri is highlighted by the different conditions promoting ferritin iron loading in the two organisms: in c. reinhardtii the major ferritin, fer <dig>  displayed maximal loading with 55fe in iron-deficient cells, whereas the o. tauri ferritin  was more strongly loaded with 55fe in cells maintained in iron-rich medium. moreover, the total iron content of o. tauri ferritin was much lower than that of c. reinhardtii ferritin . this major difference probably accounts for the fact the major ferritins of c. reinhardtii and green plants behave like most ferritins, as iron storage proteins protecting the cell against oxidative stress and storing iron for later use  <cit> , whereas the o. tauri ferritin behaves like a protein involved in intracellular iron recycling  <cit> , as does the ferritin of the diatom pseudonitzschia multiseries  <cit> . as previously reported  <cit> , the ferritin gene displayed circadian regulation, with expression levels being highest at the end of the night  <cit> . this strongly expressed gene  was also upregulated  by prolonged growth at low iron concentrations , consistent with its role in recycling iron from iron-containing proteins expressed during the day  <cit> . this result contrasts with observations for c. reinhardtii, in which both the ferritin genes, fer <dig> and fer <dig>  are strongly induced by iron starvation during the day  <cit> . the authors suggested that ferritins, together with the manganese superoxide dismutase, could protect the cells against ros, which may become more abundant when psi function is compromised  <cit> . in o. tauri, the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase  was repressed by long-term iron starvation, particularly during the day .

as the main role of o. tauri ferritin relates more to iron redistribution than to iron storage  <cit> , it remains unclear how iron is stored in this organism. the vacuole is the main iron-storage compartment in several organisms   <cit>  and a protein homologous to the yeast vacuolar iron importer ccc <dig> is found in plants   <cit> . in c. reinhardtii, the corresponding gene was unexpectedly shown to be upregulated by iron deprivation  <cit> . we found a homolog in o. tauri  that was repressed by iron starvation , consistent with a role of the vacuole in iron storage. however, it is not clear whether o. tauri actually has a vacuole, due to the small size of this eukaryote. numerous small vesicles have been described in o. tauri  <cit>  and the storage compartment could thus be a specialized small vacuolar structure related to the polyphosphate bodies  containing polyphosphate and metals described in c. reinhardtii  <cit> . this hypothesis seems probable, because a gene encoding a typical vacuolar-type h+-pyrophosphatase found in acidocalcisomes  <cit>  is present in the o. tauri genome , and this gene was induced by iron deprivation, particularly during the night . conversely, the inorganic phosphate transporter  was strongly downregulated by iron limitation at almost all time points , which suggests the existence of a strong relationship between iron and phosphorus metabolism in o. tauri, as demonstrated in land plants  <cit> . iron could thus be stored in acidocalcisome-like vesicles, possibly as polyphosphates, rather than ferritin, as suggested by an analysis of the intracellular distribution of iron. when whole extracts of 55fe-loaded o. tauri cells were subjected to fractionation by gel filtration , the major iron peak was associated with low-molecular weight compounds . we are currently investigating this issue of ferritin-independent iron storage in o. tauri.

the adaptation of cells to iron limitation involves iron-sparing mechanisms, stress responses, and general metabolic remodeling with concomitant recruitments for zinc-containing regulatory proteins, as a function of the day/night cycle
iron-sparing response, tetrapyrroles and lipids
one of the expected responses of cells to iron starvation is to decrease the amounts of iron-containing proteins not strictly required for cell viability. this was observed to some extent: one of the major sinks for iron concerns the use of nitrate as the nitrogen source. a repression of genes encoding a nitrate transport protein , nitrate reductase  and ferredoxin-nitrite reductase  was observed in both the early and later adaptive responses to iron limitation . in parallel, a rwp-rk transcription factor  likely involved in the transcriptional response to nitrate  <cit>  was strongly induced in all conditions, and a zinc gata factor possibly involved in nitrogen metabolism  was also strongly induced . conversely, the ammonium transporter  was induced during the day in cells adapted to iron limitation , possibly to compensate for the lower levels of nitrate transport. repression was also observed in all conditions for the gene encoding the  iron-sulfur cluster protein adrenodoxin, ferredoxin-like protein , and for key enzymes involved in the synthesis of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins  and in lipid metabolism  . four 2og-fe oxygenase -encoding genes  were globally repressed in iron-deficient growth conditions , with probable consequences for cell surface properties, because hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins are the major proteinaceous components of the cell walls in green algae  <cit> . the downregulation of fatty acid desaturases would also be expected to change the lipid composition of membranes . other iron-containing proteins vital for cell division  were not downregulated by iron deprivation, and a global upregulation of these proteins was even observed , reflecting the optimization of iron use/redistribution to high-priority iron-proteins during iron limitation.

as stated above, the long-term adaptation of cells to iron limitation was largely determined  by day/night cycles. thus, most genes were neither fully induced nor fully repressed, instead being up- or downregulated at different points in the day/night cycle. the genes encoding proteins involved in tetrapyrrole synthesis provide a typical example. unsurprisingly, iron deprivation leads to some chlorosis in o. tauri , and both the chlorophyll a content and the heme b content of the cells were significantly decreased by iron starvation . the decrease in chlorophyll content could result from both a decrease in synthesis  and an increase in degradation: chlorophyllide a oxygenase , another iron-containing enzyme involved in chlorophyll b synthesis, was slightly repressed, whereas the pheophorbidase gene ostta01g <dig>  was strongly upregulated under iron starvation, as was the gene encoding pheophorbide a oxygenase , a key regulator of chlorophyll catabolism  <cit>  . the decrease in heme content probably resulted from the induction of heme oxygenase  under conditions of iron deprivation , which probably made a significant contribution to the iron-sparing response by allowing the cells to recycle iron from heme. the gun <dig> gene, encoding a major regulator of tetrapyrrole synthesis  <cit> , was also strongly affected by iron nutrition conditions, as a function of the day/night cycle, and the transcription pattern of this gene was consistent with the general transcription pattern for all genes involved in heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis : in conditions of rapid iron depletion  these genes were slightly repressed during both the day and night , but when the cells were allowed to adapt to low iron conditions for several days , the transcription profile of these genes responded to the day/night cycle, with a peak of transcription at the start of the night , consistent with the actual concentrations of heme b in the cells over a 24-h period . thus, although the global level of transcription  of genes involved in tetrapyrrole synthesis was decreased by iron deprivation, and the total amount of heme was decreased , the cells maintained the day/night regulation pattern of these genes as in iron-replete cells, probably to optimize cell functions and synchronize these functions with the day/night redistribution of iron  <cit>  and the redistribution of iron resulting from long-term iron limitation. by contrast, the day/night variation in chlorophyll a content was abolished under low-iron conditions .fig.  <dig> cell response to iron deprivation in terms of tetrapyrrole metabolism. a clustering of data showing differential expression of the genes involved in tetrapyrrole synthesis and degradation in two sets of experimental conditions. results are expressed  in log base  <dig>  as logfc /. b heme b content of cells over a 24-h period, after one week of adaptation to iron-rich  or iron-poor  conditions . c chlorophyll a content of cells over a 24-h period, after one week of adaptation to iron-rich  or iron-poor  conditions 



the main iron-containing fatty acid desaturases  were globally repressed, probably as an iron-sparing response, although gene regulation remained largely responsive to the day/night cycle. as a result, the lipid composition of iron-deficient cells would be expected to shift towards more unsaturated fatty acids, as shown in c. reinhardtii  <cit> . an extensive analysis of the changes in lipid composition induced by iron deprivation will be presented elsewhere.

stress and redox response
as shown in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  the functional category “stress and redox response” was the third largest category of genes upregulated in response to short-term iron starvation , and the fourth  largest category of genes up-regulated during the long-term adaptation of cells to iron-deficient conditions.

in c. reinhardtii, iron deprivation results in an increase in antioxidant defense through the induction of genes involved in ascorbate synthesis   <cit> . as indicated above, the homologous genes were not regulated by iron in o. tauri. moreover, most of the “stress and redox response” gene products induced by iron deprivation in o. tauri have homologs not induced by iron deprivation in c. reinhardtii, with some of these homologs even being repressed in such conditions . the stress response to iron deficiency therefore appears to be very different between these two organisms, reflecting fundamental differences in their iron metabolism . the early response to iron deficiency in o. tauri  involves the recruitment of hsp20-like and other molecular chaperones , and the induction of a peroxiredoxin , but not of the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase . after long-term adaptation to iron limitation , the most strongly upregulated genes were found to be those involved in dna repair  and genes involved in thiol-based redox processes, such as a thioredoxin fold-like selenocysteine , a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase , thioredoxins/glutaredoxins  and a glutathione-s-transferase  .

surprisingly, ostreococcus has no gene for phytochelatin  <cit> , but a tesmin-like methallothionein gene was induced, particularly during the night . the product of this gene may be involved in heavy metal detoxification .

metabolism
about 20 % of the selected genes  encoded components of general metabolism . the rate of photosynthesis, as determined by oxygen production, in iron-deficient cells was half that in iron-rich cells , and the transcription of some key genes involved in the photosynthetic electron chain was significantly downregulated : the most strongly repressed gene was ostta10g <dig>  encoding a flavin amine oxidase involved in the synthesis of carotenoids , and the non-mevalonate 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate  pathway for the biosynthesis of plastid isoprenoids was probably also repressed through strong repression of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase gene . genes encoding components of psi and psii were also globally repressed after prolonged growth under iron limitation, reflecting compromised photosystem reaction centers and low rates of photosynthetic electron transport, even though the transcriptional profiles of these genes remained largely determined by the day/night cycles under iron-deficient conditions . however, some photosynthetic genes, including the genes encoding the psii reaction center psbm , the psii oxygen-evolving complex psbq  , subunit b of the cytochrome b6f complex  and violaxanthin de-epoxidase , were upregulated, probably indicating an increase in the ratio of psii to psi complexes and an increase in non-photochemical quenching capacity, as observed in other iron-starved photosynthetic organisms  <cit> .

nothing is known about mitochondrial iron metabolism in o. tauri. the mitochondrial  cluster assembly machinery was probably impaired by iron limitation, because a gene homologous to atm <dig> , encoding a key component for -mediated electron transport was slightly, but significantly repressed in all conditions of iron limitation , and the lyr family protein ostta06g <dig>  which is homologous to the yeast isd <dig> protein , were repressed after prolonged iron deprivation, particularly during the day . these data suggest that the adaptation of o. tauri to iron limitation involves a decrease in respiratory functions, consistent with the high iron requirement of the respiratory chains. interestingly, the gene encoding the alternative oxidase  was upregulated during the night in long-term adapted cells , potentially limiting ros production by the impaired respiratory chain .

in addition to reprogramming nitrogen metabolism, which could be considered to be an iron-sparing response, a number of key genes involved in carbon metabolism were up- or downregulated by iron starvation. an extensive description of iron-dependent metabolism remodeling is beyond the scope of this manuscript but will be provided elsewhere.

regulation
most of the genes either up- or downregulated by iron in both sets of growth conditions were either “regulatory” or “unknown”, and the “regulatory” functional category accounted for about 25 % of the genes analyzed . most of the regulatory genes were directly or indirectly related to replication, transcription or translation and to ribosomal functions, but a lot of posttranslational mechanisms were also involved in the adaptation of cells to iron limitation. these mechanisms included phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, chaperoning and maturation, protein sorting and vesicular trafficking, and glycosylation . nothing is known about the regulation of iron-related responses in o. tauri. in a. thaliana and c. reinhardtii, several basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factors and an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase are involved in transcriptional regulation of the iron regulon, in a complex network of iron sensing and signaling  <cit> . myb-like transcription factors are also involved in regulating iron uptake and storage in plants and in c. reinhardtii  <cit> . there is one bhlh protein homologous to a. thaliana fit <dig>   <cit>  in o. tauri , but the expression of the corresponding gene was not significantly affected by iron limitation , and the network of bhlh transcriptional regulators in the green algal lineage does not seem to be conserved in o. tauri. however, several myb-like transcription factors were downregulated by iron limitation , and the transcription of many other transcription factors was induced/repressed in response to iron limitation . in c. reinhardtii, genes directly involved in reductive iron uptake are coordinately coregulated , and it has been suggested that regulation involves the activation of genes under conditions of low iron availability rather than repression at high iron concentrations  <cit> . we were unable to identify the equivalent of an “iron regulon” in o. tauri, i.e., an ensemble of genes directly involved in iron metabolism and primarily regulated by iron at the transcription level. it is however possible that the apparent lack of a clear iron regulon simply results from our lack of knowledge: as shown in fig. 7a, there were very few genes that were upregulated by iron deprivation regardless of the day/night cycles and of the experimental conditions , but most of these genes encode unknown proteins. the same applied for genes downregulated by iron deprivation: very few genes were downregulated regardless of the day/night cycles and of the experimental conditions, and most of these genes have unknown function . in the overwhelming number of cases, iron controlled transcription differentially, according to the day/night cycles and to the experimental conditions . the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation involved in the whole-cell response to iron limitation are, therefore, probably multifactorial and complex.fig.  <dig> clusters of genes globally induced  or repressed  by iron starvation and cluster of genes encoding zinc regulatory proteins. we performed a clustering analysis  on the complete dataset; very few genes were upregulated in all conditions : these genes are grouped in cluster a. similarly, genes downregulated in all conditions are grouped in cluster b. one cluster  grouped genes encoding zinc regulatory proteins. results are expressed  in log base  <dig> as logfc /



there was an obvious transcriptional co-activation of zinc-containing regulatory proteins . these zinc-containing regulatory proteins were either zf_c2h <dig> zinc fingers  or prli-interacting factor k zinc fingers with no homolog in c. reinhardtii, and the corresponding genes displayed strikingly similar patterns of regulation  . as shown above, zinc had strong effects on iron uptake that depended on the growth conditions. conversely, we show here that iron deprivation results in the transcriptional activation of numerous genes encoding zinc-containing regulation factors. transcriptional effects thus probably underlie at least part of the connection between zinc and iron in o. tauri, through the recruitment of zinc proteins under conditions of low iron concentration. such zinc regulation factors may be required for full activation of the ot-fea1-dependent iron uptake system under iron deprivation, potentially accounting for the incomplete induction of iron uptake in zinc-deprived cells.

discussion
our work reveals tight coordination of iron metabolism with diurnal cycles in o. tauri. this observation generalizes our previous findings that intracellular iron is cycled from the main iron proteins  to ferritin   <cit> , and that cell iron uptake capacity also varies over day/night cycles  <cit> . a similar dependence of iron metabolism on the circadian clock has also been reported in higher plants  <cit> .

o. tauri rapidly responds to decreased iron nutrition by inducing the uptake of both ferric and ferrous iron, but  the ferrireductase activity of the cells is very low and is not induced by iron deprivation. the earlier induction of the iron uptake systems in o. tauri compared to c. reinhardtii in response to iron starvation may reflect differences in the role of ferritin in the two organisms: ferritin does not behave like an iron-storage protein in o. tauri  <cit> , and its weaker iron storage capacity may result in more rapid iron starvation than in c. reinhardtii cells, which can use ferritin as an iron store. however, the rapid induction of iron uptake activities in o. tauri is not fully reflected by transcriptomic data: whereas c. reinhardtii, coordinately induces genes encoding ferrireductase, ferrooxidase and iron permease proteins  in response to iron deprivation, we could only identify one gene  directly involved in iron uptake that was primarily induced by iron deprivation in all conditions  in o. tauri. however, it is always possible that some genes unaffected by iron at the transcriptional level could be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. the difference in the transcriptional response to iron limitation in o. tauri and c. reinhardtii could result from several factors.to our knowledge, the response of c. reinhardtii to changes in iron nutrition was never investigated according to the day/night cycles. such a study would perhaps also reveal a strong dependence of the cell response to iron limitation to the diurnal parameter.

the mechanisms of iron uptake are probably very different in both organisms, since o. tauri lacks the classical components of reductive iron uptake system. two genes encoding putative ferrireductases  were induced lately and are unlikely to participate in reductive iron uptake in o. tauri. as shown in yeast and plants  <cit> , intracellular iron use involves many different ferrireductases, and cytochrome b <dig> may be involved in supplying ferrous iron to the chloroplast, as suggested in other organisms  <cit> .

a lot of genes showing a strong response to iron depletion encode proteins with unknown function in o. tauri, which indicates that several pathways of iron uptake and metabolism remain to be described in this organism.



our work strongly suggests that ot-fea <dig> is directly involved in iron uptake in o. tauri. homologues of the c. reinhardtii fea1/fea <dig> proteins have been previously considered in the green algal lineage  <cit> , but ot-fea <dig> is structurally very different than cr-fea <dig>  and presents unique features that make it a good candidate for nonreductive ferric iron uptake in o. tauri, as we recently showed for isip2a in diatoms  <cit> . despite of several attempts, we were not able to generate a ∆ot-fea <dig> knockout in o. tauri, suggesting that the gene is vital for growth. we are currently trying to determine the conditions of ot-fea <dig> iron loading in vitro by overproducing this protein in e. coli and then purifying it and incubating it with extracts of o. tauri cells grown in different conditions.

ot-irt <dig> is another protein that is most probably involved in iron uptake in o. tauri, and it differs from other irt-like proteins of the green lineage by the abundance of his-rich motifs . grossoehm et al.  <cit>  showed that such his-rich sequences  has a high entropy-driven affinity for fe3+ and might be involved in retaining ferric iron on the cytoplasmic side of the protein, thereby inhibiting further ferrous iron uptake by the extracellular side of the protein. this might be of particular relevance for o. tauri, since this organism is probably able to take up iron without prior reduction.

other components involved in iron uptake by o. tauri probably remain to be identified. a better understanding of the mechanisms of iron uptake should account for the much higher efficiency of o. tauri cells to concentrate extracellular iron as compared to c. reinhardtii: our work shows that o. tauri needs much less iron in the medium than c. reinhardtii to reach maximal growth rate, although the iron requirement of both organisms is similar. this is the main reason why we propose o. tauri as an alternative model to study iron metabolism in the green algal lineage. to date, the transcriptional response to iron limitation in marine micro-algae was mainly investigated in diatoms. some centric diatoms like thalassiosira pseudonana have genes encoding all the components of a classical reductive iron uptake system similar to that of c. reinhardtii  <cit> . in t. pseudonana, kustka et al.  <cit>  showed that the genes encoding plasma membrane ferrireductases  and two very similar iron permeases  were upregulated in response to iron deprivation, while the gene encoding a putative multicopper ferroxidase  was not responsive to iron. in contrast, fet <dig> and ftr <dig> homologues are lacking in the genome of the pennate diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum, which suggests that iron uptake does not involve a ferroxidase-permease complex in this species  <cit> . the transcriptional response of p. tricornutum to iron starvation involves the strong upregulation of isip genes , among which isip2a, encoding a protein that concentrates iron at the cell surface and facilitates its uptake  <cit> . there is thus some similarity between p. tricornutum and o. tauri, since both species lack the classical components of a reductive iron uptake system  and both species respond to iron deprivation by inducing proteins that are phylogenetically related : isip2a  and ot-fea <dig> .

besides iron uptake, the transcriptional response of o. tauri to iron limitation differs from that of other chlorophytes  by several important features, especially related to the stress response. an increase in antioxidant mechanisms in response to iron limitation has been demonstrated in various plants and algae  <cit> , and a key defense response has been shown to be mediated by ascorbate in c. reinhardtii, in which iron limitation results in a 10-fold increase in cell ascorbate content  <cit> . at the same time, the response of c. reinhardtii to iron deprivation involves induction of the cu/zn superoxide dismutase and of both ferritins fer <dig> and fer <dig>  <cit> . we show here that the response of o. tauri to iron deprivation is completely different: transcription of key genes involved in ascorbate synthesis and of the gene encoding cu/zn superoxide dismutase is unaffected by the iron status in o. tauri. as shown in other organisms  <cit> , peroxiredoxin  may therefore be the main scavenger of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in o. tauri. ferritins also behave very differently in o. tauri and c. reinhardtii, with respect to iron-dependent transcription of the corresponding genes, but also regarding the conditions promoting iron loading of the proteins .

CONCLUSIONS
there is increasing evidence to suggest that several marine microalgae have iron uptake systems different from those in terrestrial organisms, involving for example, the nonreductive uptake of inorganic ferric species, as an adaptation to the extreme scarcity of iron prevailing over vast ocean regions. o. tauri could therefore be used as an alternative model alga  for studying iron metabolism in unicellular marine photosynthetic organisms. our results show that iron metabolism differs considerably between these two species. o. tauri is much more efficient than c. reinhardtii at taking up iron from media with low iron content and it can grow with as little as one hundredth the amount of iron required by c. reinhardtii. this organism must, therefore, have powerful iron uptake systems. the novel protein ot-fea <dig> seems to be involved primarily in iron uptake by o. tauri.

one striking feature of o. tauri iron metabolism is its tight dependence on the day/night cycle. among the genes displaying differential expression with a log ratio > <dig>  for at least one time point after adaptation of the cells to iron limitation , only 7 % were induced during both the day and the night . the transcriptional response to iron limitation was therefore highly dependent on the diurnal cycle. this diurnal regulation probably reflects the intracellular recycling of iron between iron-containing proteins and ferritin  <cit> . regulation of the ferritin gene is multifactorial and ferritin itself has a regulatory function, possibly related to iron sensing. the ferritin gene is under circadian regulation  <cit>  and is also regulated by iron in a complex manner: in short-term experiments we showed that high iron concentration in the medium resulted in larger amounts of the translation product, in experiments using a ferritin-luc reporter gene  <cit> . however, we also show here that the ferritin gene was upregulated only during the night in conditions of long-term iron limitation. moreover, ferritin is itself involved in the regulation of its own gene, as we were able to show that circadian regulation was abolished for a ferritin-luc homologous recombinant . ferritin is also directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of iron uptake   <cit> . these data suggest that iron homeostasis is orchestrated around ferritin in o. tauri. such a mode of regulation of iron homeostasis has to our knowledge never been described previously, but could be widespread in marine microalgae: recent work in pseudonitzschia multiseries showed that the ferritin of this marine diatom was more involved in iron redistribution than in iron storage  <cit> .

another striking feature of o. tauri iron metabolism is its connection with zinc metabolism. such a strong iron/zinc connection has not been described in c. reinhardtii, and could be related to the particular mechanisms of regulation of iron metabolism in o. tauri, involving the recruitment of many zinc-containing proteins.

we currently know very little about the molecular mechanisms of iron uptake and homeostasis in eukaryotic phytoplankton, and this lack of knowledge is reflected here, because the genes displaying the highest levels of differential expression as a function of iron nutrition had unknown functions. the very large number of such “pioneer proteins” is another striking feature that emerges from our work.
