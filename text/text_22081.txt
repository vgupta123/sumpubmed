BACKGROUND
peanut  is an autogamous allotetraploid legume  composed of a and b genomes that are derived from two diploids, most likely a. duranensis  and a. ipaënsis . on the basis of branching habit, the presence/absence of flowers on the main stem, alternate vs. sequential branching, fruit and seed traits, and maturity, a. hypogaea has been categorized into two subspecies: hypogaea and fastigiata; six botanical varieties: hypogaeahirsutafastigiatavulgarisaequatoriana, and peruviana; and four agronomic types: virginia, spanish, valencia, and southeast-runner  <cit> . as the nuclear dna content in peanut is calculated to be  <dig>  pg/2 c  <cit> , the genome size is estimated to be approximately  <dig>  gb based on an assumption that 1 pg of dna is equivalent to 980 mb  <cit> . because of its allotetraploidy and large genome size, genomic study in the peanut has lagged far behind that of other legumes, such as lotus japonicus <cit> , glycine max <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit> , and cajanus cajan <cit> . in addition, low genetic diversity within the species has inhibited the advance of genetic linkage map construction. in autogamous species, the genetic diversity of polyploids is generally more narrow than that of their diploid progenitors due to bottleneck effects, and this results in few alleles having been transferred from diploid progenitors to their polyploid descendents  <cit> . moreover, genetic diversity is affected by the history of polyploidization. tetraploid peanut is thought to have arisen approximately  <dig>  years ago  <cit> , and its short history has been considered a source of lower levels of polymorphism compared with diploid arachis species  <cit> .

at present, more than  <dig>  dna markers have been developed in arachis spp.  <cit> , e.g., restriction fragment length polymorphism  <cit>  and simple sequence repeats   <cit> . linkage maps were constructed in wild diploids  <cit> , cultivated species  <cit> , and artificial amphidiploids derived from wild diploids  <cit> . integrated maps based on cultivated peanuts were also constructed  <cit> . however, the peanut linkage map has not yet covered all of the chromosomes of the haploid genome . although extremely low genetic diversity has inhibited the construction of high-density genetic linkage maps in peanut, increasing the number of polymorphic markers is crucial for the saturation of linkage maps in peanut.

in general, ssr markers have been developed from randomly collected sequence data of complementary dnas   <cit> , ssr-enriched genomic dna libraries  <cit> , and bac-ends  <cit> . primers were designed based on flanking regions of identified ssrs of the obtained sequences, and then polymorphism of the targeted ssrs was investigated using gel or capillary electrophoresis of dna amplified by pcr. however, since the degree of polymorphism of the markers depends on the genetic diversity of the germplasm, experimental analysis requires considerable cost, time, and labor to develop a large number of polymorphic markers in species having low genetic diversity. therefore, this strategy is not effective for the large-scale development of polymorphic dna markers in closely-related lines. for the development of single nucleotide polymorphism  markers, on the other hand, in silico polymorphism analysis, i.e., comparison of genomic or cdna sequences derived from more than two lines, is often performed before synthesizing primers of dna markers for lab validation. to our knowledge, this approach has been limited, e.g., polyssr  <cit>  and ssrpoly  <cit> . however, we consider that in silico polymorphism analysis prior to primer synthesis is also effective for ssr and other types of dna marker development.

recently, we have developed a total of  <dig> ahmite <dig> transposon markers in peanut  <cit> . the percentage of the transposon markers that were polymorphic between the two peanut lines was  <dig> %, which was higher than that of the ssr markers  <cit> . this result suggested that transposon markers, like ssr markers, represent potent, co-dominant, and pcr-based markers.

peanut is widely cultivated in asia, africa, america, and australia as a food and oil crop. peanut breeding has achieved a rise in productivity by increasing the size and number of seeds, and by enhancing resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . breeding has been mostly performed by conventional methods, e.g., a combination of crossing, phenotypic selections, and homogenization. in conventional breeding, large sizes of breeding populations are required, especially for the selection of recessive traits, because single gene mutations often do not confer phenotypic variation in peanut due to functional complementation by homoeologous genes. thus, molecular breeding with marker-assisted selection has great promise and may lead to remarkable advances in peanut breeding. while quantitative trait locus  analysis is an effective method for identification of dna markers linked to agronomically important traits, few qtl studies have been conducted due to the lack of high-density linkage maps in peanut  <cit> .

because peanut is used as an oil crop, seed quality is also an important breeding objective. the major components of peanut oil are linoleic acid and oleic acid, consisting of 36-67% and 15-43% of total oil, respectively, in normal cultivars  <cit> . whereas normal cultivars have a ratio of oleic to linoleic acid  of about 1: <dig>  the ratio can reach as high as 1: <dig> or 1: <dig> in high-o/l ratio cultivars  <cit> . oleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid, whereas linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid. therefore oleic acid is less oxidized than linoleic acid, and it is considered that oleic acid is better for health and storage quality  <cit> . in high-o/l ratio plants, oleic acid is synthesized from stearic acid and is converted into linoleic acid by two fatty acid desaturases encoded by sad and fad <dig> <cit> . the selection of mutated alleles of fad <dig>  which is associated with oleic-acid content in seeds  <cit> , is a straightforward strategy to efficiently generate high-oleic acid crops. in peanut, ahfad2a and ahfad2b have been identified on the a and b genomes, respectively, and the mutant alleles are reported to confer a high o/l ratio  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated whether in silico polymorphism analysis could increase the efficiency of development of polymorphic ssr and transposon markers. first, genomic sequences covering ssr and transposon-inserted regions derived from two peanut lines were compared in silico to identify candidate polymorphic regions. then, the candidate polymorphic regions were subjected to lab validation. high-density genetic linkage maps were constructed using the developed polymorphic markers along with published markers. the developed linkage maps demonstrated their applicability to molecular breeding through qtl mapping for agronomical traits and fad <dig> gene mapping for the development of varieties with high o/l ratios.

methods
plant materials and dna extraction
two f <dig> mapping populations, i.e., skf <dig> and nyf <dig>  were used for the construction of linkage maps. the skf <dig>  was generated from a cross between two lines belonging to different agronomic and morphological types, i.e., a virginia type, ‘satonoka’, and a spanish type, ‘kintoki’. the skf <dig> population is expected to generate a larger number of polymorphic markers for construction of a high-density linkage map. it has also been used for the identification of  <dig> agronomic trait loci. the nyf <dig>  is a breeding population derived from a cross between a virginia type, ‘yi-0311’, which is also considered as a southeast-runner type, and another virginia type, ‘nakateyutaka’. the former is a breeding line showing a high o/l ratio in seeds, and the latter is a leading cultivar in japan with a normal o/l ratio. this mapping population was used for the identification of linkages between genotypes of fad <dig> genes and o/l ratio in seeds. genomic dna from each line was extracted using the dneasy plant mini kit .

development of ssr markers by in silico polymorphism analysis
to develop ssr markers, two ssr-enriched genomic libraries were constructed, as described by nunome et al. <cit> . while the first library was generated from a single line, ‘satonoka’, the second library was developed using two lines, ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’, for in silico polymorphism analysis. both libraries were constructed with biotinylated oligo probes of  <dig> and  <dig>  sequencing analysis of all libraries and primer design for the first library were performed as described by sraphet et al. <cit> . for the second library, primers were designed based only on flanking sequences of polymorphic ssrs between ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’, identified by in silico analysis as described below. the ssr motifs in the sequences were identified by the fuzznuc tool from emboss, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , and the sequences with ssr motifs were assembled by the cap <dig> program with parameters set to require 95% identify to be considered overlapping   <cit> . of the obtained assemblies, contigs comprising sequences with different lengths of the same ssr motifs  between two lines were selected as polymorphic ssr candidates for primer design. all of the designed genomic ssr markers were designated as ahgs  markers.

development of transposon markers through in silico polymorphism analysis
shirasawa et al. <cit>  reported that insertion sites in the peanut genome for the transposon ahmite <dig> differ among cultivars. they also demonstrated that the insertional polymorphisms of transposon elements can be used as dna markers by developing  <dig> polymorphic markers derived from transposon-enriched genomic libraries. to develop additional transposon markers, transposon-enriched genomic libraries were constructed from ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’, and sequences were obtained as previously described  <cit> . the individual sequences were assembled using the cap <dig> program with default parameters  <cit> . contigs and singlets having ahmite <dig> sequences only on one cultivar  were selected as candidate polymorphic sequences. using the primer <dig> program  <cit> , primers were designed on both flanking sequences of ahmite <dig>  or on one of the flanking sequences and an internal sequence of ahmite <dig> in cases lacking either flanking sequence.

additionally, the flanking sequences of the ahmite <dig> transposons were cloned using inverse pcr. genomic dna fragments digested by mboi, msei, or xspi were self-ligated using t <dig> dna ligase  and used as pcr templates. ten microliters of pcr mixture, composed of  <dig>  ng/μl template dna,  <dig>  pmol/μl primer pairs , 1x pcr buffer ,  <dig>  mm dntps, 5 mm mgcl <dig>  and  <dig>  u biotaq dna polymerase , was used. the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: a 1 min initial denaturation at 94 °c;  <dig> cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 °c, 30 s of annealing at 60 °c, and a 90 s extension at 72 °c; and a 3 min final extension at 72 °c. the amplified dnas were ligated into pgem-t® easy plasmids . plasmids were introduced into escherichia coli electroten-blue  by electroporation. following the amplification of dna inserts with the illustra templiphi dna amplification kit , nucleotide sequences were determined using the bigdye terminator kit  and an abi 3730xl dna sequencer .

the transposon markers were designated as ahte , as described in shirasawa et al. <cit> .

ssr markers derived from bac-end sequences
bac libraries for a. duranensis  and a. ipaënsis  have been constructed by guimarães et al. <cit> . dr. bertioli, university of brasilia, brazil, and his colleagues determined the end sequences of the bac clones and designed primers on flanking regions of identified ssrs . these bac-end derived ssr markers kindly provided by dr. bertioli were also subjected to polymorphism analysis .

polymorphism analysis of the dna markers
in addition to the ahgs and ahte markers developed in this study, a total of  <dig>  previously published markers  <cit>  were used for the polymorphism analysis . pcr reactions were performed using  <dig>  ng genomic dna in each 5 μl reaction. in addition to template dna, pcr reaction mixtures contained 1x pcr buffer , 3 mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  u biotaqtm dna polymerase ,  <dig>  mm dntps, and  <dig>  μm of each primer. the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 1 min denaturation at 94 °c;  <dig> cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 °c, 30 s of annealing at 60 °c, and a 1 min extension at 72 °c; and a final 3 min extension at 72 °c. the pcr products were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1x tbe buffer according to the standard protocol, or with a fluorescent fragment analyzer, abi 3730xl . in the latter case, the data were analyzed using genemapper software .

the previously reported snp in ahfad2a and transposon insertional polymorphism in ahfad2b were also investigated to check the existence of polymorphisms in the nyf <dig> population  <cit> . the snp was genotyped by the taqman assay with primer pairs  and taqman probes  on the 7900ht fast real-time pcr system . the taqman assay was performed according to the protocol of the taqman genotyping master mix . transposon insertional polymorphisms were detected on 2% agarose gel as a difference in mobility of the dna fragments that had been amplified by pcr with primers bf19: 5’-cagaaccattagctttg-3’ and r1: 5’-ctctgactatgcatcag-3’  <cit> . pcr and electrophoresis were performed as described above.

construction of linkage maps
linkage analysis was performed on segregated genotypic data from the two mapping populations using joinmap® version  <dig>  <cit> . the marker loci were roughly classified using the joinmap® grouping module with logarithm of odds  scores of  <dig> – <dig> . marker order and genetic distance were calculated using a regression mapping algorithm with the following parameters: haldane’s mapping function, recombination frequency ≤  <dig> , and lod score ≥  <dig> . the graphical linkage maps were drawn with the mapchart program  <cit> .

phenotyping and qtl analysis
a total of  <dig> morphological traits of the skf <dig> population were investigated in the peanut plant breeding field of the chiba prefectural agriculture and forestry research center, japan . the seeds were sown in may,  <dig> with 66 cm and 20 cm inter- and intra-row spacing, respectively. the flowering date for each plant was determined based on the opening of the first flower. numbers and angles of branches, lengths of main stems and the longest branches, and fresh weights of the whole plant were measured at the harvesting stage. after drying of harvested pods under natural conditions for two weeks, the length, thickness, width, and weight of the matured pods were measured. in addition, constrictions on the pods were scored from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the shapes of the tips of the pods were also scored from  <dig>  to  <dig> . after that, numbers of seeds per plant and mean weights of single seeds were investigated. colors of seed coats were classified as orange–yellow  or brown–red , based on the munsell color system.

to investigate the fatty acid content of the seeds, the 32 f <dig> parents of the nyf <dig> mapping population were planted in the peanut plant breeding field of the chiba prefectural agriculture and forestry research center in may,  <dig> with 66 cm and 30 cm inter- and intra-row spacing, respectively. the f <dig> seeds were harvested in october and dried for one month in an open-air condition in their pods. one quarter of each of the dried seeds was cut off, and then 25 mg of the seeds was homogenized using tissuelyzer  with 400 μl of 100%  methanol. the homogenate was incubated at 70 °c for 15 min with  <dig>  μl of 91%  methanol and then centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 5 min. the supernatant was transferred to a glass tube. the pellet was resuspended in 750 μl of chloroform with 2 mg/ml nonadecanoic acid methyl ester , and the chloroform  layer was mixed with the supernatant layer. after washing the mixture with water, 900 μl chloroform and 1 ml of 3%  sulfuric acid in methanol were added to the chloroform layer, followed by washing with water. then, 10 μl of the chloroform layer was dried with n <dig> gas, 70 μl n-heptane, 10 μl pyridine, and 10 μl n-methyl-n-trifluoroacetamide . fatty acid quantification was performed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry  with a 6890 n network gc system  equipped with a column db-17ms  , coupled to pegasus <dig>  with the following settings: inlet temperature, 250 °c; oven temperature, 70 °c for 5 min, increasing by 15 °c/min, and holding at 310 °c for 5 min; transfer tube temperature, 200 °c; and ion source temperature, 250 °c. acquisition and analysis of mass spectral data were performed using the chromatoftm version  <dig>  optimized for pegasus . concentrations of oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid were estimated from calibration curves created using pure samples of each compound.

the phenotypic data regarding morphological traits of the skf <dig> population were subjected to composite interval mapping by the windows qtl cartographer program  <cit> . the thresholds of lod for each qtl were determined by  <dig>  permutation tests. since two genes, ahfad2a and ahfad2b, were reported to control the o/l ratio in seeds with epistatic interactions, qtl analysis of the nyf <dig> population was conducted with genotype matrix mapping  software with the following parameters: max length of locus combination = 2; min number of corresponding samples = 1; search range = auto  <cit> .

RESULTS
design of polymorphic genomic ssr markers
in the first library, a total of  <dig>  genomic clones were sequenced. after removing redundant sequences,  <dig>  primer pairs were designed to amplify the flanking regions of ssrs  and designated as ahgs markers  <cit>  . out of the  <dig>  ahgs markers,  <dig> were screened for polymorphism compared with the four parental lines of the mapping populations using a fluorescent fragment analyzer. according to the results,  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers showed polymorphism between ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’ and between ‘nakateyutaka’ and ‘yi-0311’, respectively.

the second pair of genomic ssr libraries for in silico polymorphism analysis was constructed from ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’, and a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  clones were sequenced, respectively. after trimming vector, linker, and low-quality sequences, sequences with ssr motifs were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences consisting of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ssr-containing contigs and singlets, respectively. in the comparative analysis of the lengths of ssr motifs on each sequence, for  <dig>  of the  <dig>  contigs, the ssr repeats differed in length between ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’, while  <dig> contigs  had identical-length ssr repeats between the two lines. the remaining  <dig>  contigs , as well as  <dig>  singlets, were composed of fragments derived from either line. after eliminating sequences that were identical to those from the first library,  <dig> primer pairs were designed to amplify polymorphic sequences,  <dig> were designed to amplify non-polymorphic sequences, and  <dig>  additional, untested primer pairs were designed  . screening for polymorphism was performed using a fluorescent fragment analyzer with the parental lines of the mapping populations, the skf <dig> and the nyf <dig>  with  <dig>  primer pairs consisting of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  primer pairs randomly selected from polymorphic, non-polymorphic, and untested ssr candidate data, respectively. a total of  <dig> of the tested  <dig>  markers  showed polymorphisms between ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’, including  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate polymorphic ,  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate non-polymorphic , and  <dig> of the  <dig>  untested  markers. of the candidate polymorphic markers, the remaining  <dig>  were monomorphic between the parental lines. between ‘nakateyutaka’ and ‘yi-0311’,  <dig> candidate polymorphic ,  <dig> candidate non-polymorphic , and  <dig> candidate probable polymorphic  markers showed polymorphism. as results of the polymorphism screenings with a total of  <dig> genomic ssr markers,  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed polymorphisms between ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’ and between ‘nakateyutaka’ and ‘yi-0311’, respectively .

a total of  <dig>  ahgs markers were designed from the first and second ssr-enriched genomic libraries. out of these markers, the poly n motif was the most abundant , followed by poly n , due to the usage of biotinylated oligo probes of poly  <dig> and poly  <dig> in the construction of the libraries . the frequencies of the other di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide repeat motifs were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. the distributions of the ssr motifs found in the two libraries were not different. between ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’, the polymorphic ratio of the poly n motif,  <dig> % , was higher than that of the poly n motifs,  <dig> %  .

design and polymorphism analysis of transposon markers
as with the ahgs marker development, transposon markers named ahte were developed via in silico polymorphism analysis. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  clones derived from ahmite1-enriched genomic libraries of ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’, respectively, were sequenced. of the total  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  were identified as including ahmite <dig> sequences in the fragments. these were then assembled into  <dig>  contigs. cultivar-specific transposon insertions were identified in  <dig> out of the  <dig>  contigs. in addition,  <dig> additional insertion sites were found from the libraries derived from the inverse pcr analysis. in total,  <dig> primer pairs were designed based on the flanking regions of identified ahmite1s  . when polymorphism analysis was performed using these  <dig> primer pairs with the four parental lines of the mapping population, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers exhibited polymorphism between ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’, and between ‘nakateyutaka’ and ‘yi-0311’, respectively .

polymorphism analysis of the previously published marker loci
a total of  <dig>  markers derived from other studies, including  <dig> genomic ssrs  <cit> ,  <dig>  est-ssrs  <cit> ,  <dig> bac-end ssrs , and  <dig> transposon markers  <cit> , were used for polymorphism analysis between the four mapping parents . out of the  <dig>  markers,  <dig> , including  <dig> genomic ssrs ,  <dig> est-ssrs ,  <dig> bac-end ssrs , and  <dig> transposon markers , were selected as polymorphic markers between ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’ . between ‘nakateyutaka’ and ‘yi-0311’,  <dig> genomic ssrs ,  <dig> est-ssrs ,  <dig> bac-end ssrs , and  <dig> transposon markers  showed polymorphism .

construction of the skf <dig> genetic linkage map
a total of  <dig>  of the  <dig>   tested markers showed polymorphism between ‘satonoka’ and ‘kintoki’. nineteen, three, and one markers identified doubled, tripled, and quadrupled polymorphic loci, respectively, while  <dig>  markers generated single polymorphic loci. consequently,  <dig>  segregating loci were generated from the  <dig>  markers. a total of  <dig>  of the  <dig>  segregated loci  were mapped onto  <dig> linkage groups , resulting in the skf <dig> genetic linkage map. the length of the genetic linkage map was  <dig> .4 cm, with distances ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm . of the  <dig>  loci,  <dig> were generated from markers developed in this study and in shirasawa et al. <cit> .

a) percentages of segregation loci with probability level p <  <dig> .

b) including the ahte markers developed in the previous study .

c) including the bac-end ssr markers developed by bertioli et al. .

the lgs were named according to the consensus numbers of the previously reported maps by comparison of the mapping position of the  <dig> commonly mapped markers  <cit>  . eight homoeologous pairs of linkage groups  were identified, i.e.,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  those pairs were suffixed ‘.1’ and ‘.2’; for example, lg <dig>  and lg <dig>  . in hg <dig>  three linkage groups were identified and designated as lg <dig> , lg <dig> , and lg <dig> . because two remaining linkage groups were generated with some common markers from previously reported maps, these linkage groups were tentatively named lg <dig>  and lg <dig> .

the average marker density of the skf <dig> maps was  <dig>  cm in total, ranging from  <dig>  cm for lg <dig>  to  <dig>  cm for lg <dig>  in the  <dig> linkage groups. the largest interval between two loci was  <dig>  cm, observed between ahgs <dig> and ahgs <dig> on lg <dig> . in the skf <dig> map,  <dig> % of the total marker loci showed segregation distortions, ranging from  <dig> % in lg <dig>  to  <dig> % in lg <dig>  .

construction of the nyf <dig> linkage map
a total of  <dig> of the  <dig>   tested markers showed polymorphism between ‘nakateyutaka’ and ‘yi-0311’. while four markers identified double polymorphic loci, the other  <dig> markers generated single polymorphic loci. consequently,  <dig> polymorphic loci were generated from the  <dig> markers. because the snp for the d150n change in ahfad2a <cit>  and the transposon insertion polymorphism at the 665th base in ahfad2b <cit>  segregated in the nyf <dig> population, the ahfad2a and ahfad2b genes were subjected to genotyping of the f <dig> population together with the  <dig> polymorphic loci. a total of  <dig> segregating loci  formed  <dig> linkage groups  . of the  <dig> lgs,  <dig> were numbered corresponding to the skf <dig> maps and the previously reported maps with  <dig> anchor markers  <cit>  . the remaining linkage group was tentatively named lgx because this lg had the possibility of corresponding to either lg <dig> , lg <dig> , or lg <dig>  of the skf <dig>  the ahfad2a and ahfad2b genes were mapped onto lg <dig>  and lg <dig> , respectively, as reported by qin et al. <cit> . the total length of the map was  <dig> .9 cm, with individual lgs ranging from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm . the average marker density was  <dig>  cm, ranging from  <dig>  cm in the lg <dig>  to  <dig>  cm in the lgx. in the nyf <dig> map,  <dig> % of the marker loci showed significant segregation distortions. the highest segregation distortion was observed in lg <dig>  , whereas seven lgs had no distorted loci . of the  <dig> loci,  <dig> were generated from markers developed in this study and in shirasawa et al. <cit> .

detection of qtls for agronomical traits
phenotypic values of  <dig> morphological quantitative traits investigated in skf <dig> exhibited transgressive segregation relative to the mapping parents . a total of  <dig> significant qtls were detected for the  <dig> investigated traits . the phenotype variance explained by the qtls ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. a qtl for flowering date was detected on lg <dig>  and named as qfd <dig> , of which the ‘kinotki’ allele had an effect of late flowering. two qtls for branching angle, qab <dig>  and qab <dig> , were detected on lg <dig>  and lg <dig> , with opposite directions of additive effects. as traits for plant size, three , two , one , and one  qtls affecting the length of the main stem, length of the longest branch, number of branches, and weight of the plant were detected, respectively, all of which had positive additive effects for the ‘kintoki’ allele except for qlms <dig> . qtls for length of the main stem, length of the longest branch, and weight per plant were detected in the same marker interval in lg <dig> . the traits showed significant correlation with each other, and therefore it was suggested that the identified qtls controlled plant biomass . for pod characters, three qtls for length , one for thickness , two for wideness , two for constriction , and one for shape of the beak  were detected. qtls for seed weight  and number of seeds per plant  did not overlap but did map to the same lg . a qtl cluster was found for pod thickness and width on lg <dig> , and the correlation was significant . thus, the qtl was considered to regulate lateral growth of pods. other qtls related to pod character, i.e., weight of mature pod per plant , length of pod , and constriction of pod , mapped on lg <dig>  but in different marker intervals. the trait for red seed coat color , which is not a quantitative but a qualitative trait, segregated into  <dig> red and  <dig> orange–yellow offspring, fitting a 3: <dig> ratio by the chi-square test . this trait mapped to a single locus between two marker loci, pm3a and ahgs <dig>  in the lg <dig>  with an lod value of  <dig> .

a) effect of 'kintoki' allele.

relationship between mutations of ahfad <dig> genes and the o/l ratio
in nyf <dig>  fatty acid concentration was determined for the parental and  <dig> individual f <dig> seeds. the o/l ratio of the parental lines, ‘nakateyutaka’ and ‘yi-0311’, were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. the o/l ratio of the f <dig> lines ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . of the 185 f <dig> plants, the o/l ratios of the  <dig> lines were as low as that of the ‘nakateyutaka’, while the other seven were, remarkably, as high as that of ‘yi-0311’. the o/l ratio did not significantly correlate with the sum of oleic-acid and linoleic-acid contents, or oleic-acid content, but showed negative correlation with linoleic-acid content . this result suggests that a change in the o/l ratio could mainly be attributed to linoleic-acid biosynthesis activity. the significant association between o/l ratio in seeds and the combination of genotypes of ahfad2a and ahfad2b was confirmed by gmm analysis with f value =  <dig> . <dig>  p <  <dig> . the phenotype variance explained by these two genes was  <dig> %. all seven of the f <dig> seeds that showed a high o/l ratio exhibited homozygous genotypes derived from ‘yi-0311’ on the ahfad2a and ahfad <dig> genes .

discussion
in this study, we developed a high-density genetic linkage map, skf <dig>  of a total length of  <dig> .4 cm consisting of  <dig>  marker loci . genetic linkage maps in arachis spp. have been constructed using mapping populations derived from crosses between interspecific diploids  <cit>  or synthetic tetraploids  <cit> , as well as cultivated tetraploids  <cit> . in addition, the integration of more than two maps by connecting common markers as anchors has been conducted to produce a higher number of marker loci than that on single maps  <cit> . while it is true that map integration is an effective way to increase marker loci on a single map, the development of new markers is still required to saturate linkage maps in peanut. as far as we know, the skf <dig> map covering  <dig> .4 cm with  <dig>  loci is the highest-density genetic linkage map in arachis, and probably covers a large portion of the peanut genome because the total length of the map is almost equal to those of maps for tetraploids , and double those of maps for wild diploids .

our results suggested that in silico polymorphism analysis worked effectively for the development of polymorphic ssr and transposon markers. this was the first time in silico polymorphism analysis has been used in peanut. the polymorphic ratios in skf <dig> increased from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  in total, i.e.,  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  for genomic ssr markers and  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  for transposon markers, by employing in silico polymorphism analysis. in this study, we performed empirical analysis for  <dig>  of  <dig>  primer pairs generated via in silico polymorphism analysis. if 32% of ssr markers derived from a second library show polymorphisms in the skf <dig> population, an additional  <dig>  markers would map to the skf <dig> map.

though in silico polymorphism analysis was performed for parental lines of skf <dig>  the analysis increased polymorphic ratios in the nyf <dig> population as well. this result suggested that in silico polymorphism analysis between two lines enhances the efficiency of polymorphic marker development in this species. koilkonda et al. <cit>  investigated genetic distances for  <dig> arachis spp. accessions, including the four parental lines used in this study. according to their results, greater genetic diversity was observed among cultivated peanut lines than among our four parental lines. thus, we considered that marker subsets developed in this study could be useful sources for obtaining polymorphic markers in other mapping populations. however, in parallel, the generation of an insufficient number of polymorphic markers in nyf <dig> suggested that additional in silico polymorphism analysis is required to develop polymorphic markers that can differentiate between closely-related lines such as the parents of nyf <dig> 

meanwhile, of the candidate polymorphic sequences,  <dig> % of the ssrs and  <dig> % of the transposon markers did not show polymorphisms. two reasons might account for such identification of false positives in in silico polymorphism analysis. the first is related to the presence of the a and b genomes in tetraploid peanut. for example, in the case of sequences of one parent being derived from only the a genome and those of another parent being derived from only the b genome, there is a high possibility that homoeologous polymorphisms could be identified but not allelic polymorphisms. another possible reason is sequencing errors introduced through the use of the sanger method. new robust sequencing technologies, e.g., pyrosequencing and sequencing by synthesis or ligation, which have been used in massive parallel sequencers, may overcome these two possible causes because the principles underlying the sequencing reaction are different from those of the sanger method, and duplication ratios of sequences per target region can be increased because of the ability to conduct high-throughput data generation.

the number of linkage groups of the skf <dig> was one more than the number of haploid chromosomes of a. hypogaea, and the diversified density of dna markers on each linkage group ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm/marker-locus. this indicates that genetic diversity is different between chromosomes of cultivated peanut. the polymorphism analysis in diploid arachis species suggested that genetic diversity between b genome species was considerably lower than that between a genome species  <cit> . though we cannot draw any conclusions from this study, it was predicted that similar differences might occur in the tetraploid genome. it has been suggested that the ahmite1s originated from the b genome  <cit>  but are currently distributed throughout the whole peanut genome . this indicates that the ahmite1s transposed from the b genome to the combined a and b genome without any bias in insertional position.

in the present study, agronomically important traits for flowering date, plant architecture, pod and seed characters, and seed quality were identified. whereas several qtls for drought stress tolerance and resistance to rust and foliar diseases have been reported in peanut  <cit> , qtl analyses focused on morphological and physiological traits considered important for breeding have not been conducted. on the other hand, genomic and genetic studies of such traits have progressed in soybean  <cit>  and l. japonicus <cit> ; both of these genomes have been sequenced  <cit> . if the genetic knowledge gained through comparative genomics using models is to be applied to crop legumes, the in silico polymorphism analysis must be effective for est-ssr markers. because nucleotide sequences of ests generally show higher levels of similarity across different species, genera, and families than sequences from intergenic regions, generating and mapping additional est-ssr markers might help the progress of comparative analysis with other arachis spp. and model legumes. further genetic analysis will provide helpful information that will allow the identification of qtls in peanut corresponding to the genome sequences of model legumes.

candidate gene approaches, as well as comparative maps, will greatly help to develop dna markers tightly linked to important traits that have been gained through the study of model legumes. direct selection of two recessive alleles of the fad <dig> genes will facilitate high oleic-acid peanut breeding. furthermore, introgression breeding of the high-oleic acid trait into elite cultivars can be easily performed with recurrent backcrossings and marker-assisted selection for the sake of monitoring both alleles of the fad <dig> genes along with genetic background nature. similarly, flowering date, pod and seed characters, and plant architecture, as well as stress tolerance and disease resistance, can be efficiently altered by molecular breeding with marker-assisted selection.

CONCLUSIONS
the efficiency of polymorphic marker development was improved remarkably by using in silico polymorphism analysis, in comparison with the previous method, in which primers were simply designed based on the flanking sequences of ssr motifs. the resultant linkage maps possess the highest number of marker loci in cultivated peanut as well as arachis spp. moreover, the developed linkage maps are applicable to the identification of qtls and genes for agronomical traits, including seed quality. these data should be useful for genetics, genomics, and breeding in arachis spp. this type of in silico polymorphism analysis should also be applicable to other crop species.
