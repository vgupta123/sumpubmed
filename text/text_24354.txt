BACKGROUND
bacteria, archaea, and lower eukaryotes rely on two-component signal transduction systems as a major strategy to monitor the extra- and intracellular environment for physical and biological changes  <cit> . these multi-protein phospho-relay signaling systems allow cellular adaptation to changes in nutrient availability, osmolarity, oxygen, redox potential, light, plus other cell viability and survival determining factors. the two-component paradigm involves phosphoryl transfer from a sensor kinase that detects an environmental change to a cognate response regulator  that executes an adaptive action. rrs of two or more domains usually contain a structurally conserved n-terminal “receiver” domain  that houses the phosphorylation site, and a c-terminal “output” domain  that can have an array of functions. phosphorylation of the rd elicits a response from the od, the most prevalent being dna binding and transcriptional regulation  <cit> .

in escherichia coli, the availability of nitrate during anaerobiosis triggers the nar two-component system  <cit> . phosphoryl transfer occurs from dual sensor kinases narx and narq to the two rrs narl and narp. narl and narp are transcription factors, which together regulate a family of genes involved in anaerobic respiration and fermentation  <cit> . structures of full-length, unphosphorylated narl  <cit>  from e. coli depict a canonical n-terminal rd, a dna-binding c-terminal od, and a 32-residue linker that joins them . in the unphosphorylated conformation, the rd occludes the dna recognition helix  of the dna binding od  <cit> . the activation mechanism implicit in the structure, whereby phosphorylation serves to disrupt the interdomain interface and to liberate the od, was also corroborated by biochemical studies . once liberated, the narl od binds consensus sequences along promoter regions, with preference for inverted dna heptamers separated by two base-pairs, called 7-2- <dig> sites  <cit> . structures of the isolated narl od bound to dna  <cit>  revealed that the od binds 7-2- <dig> sites as a dimer, whereby dimerization occurs along helix α <dig>  this finding expands the activation mechanism to include the movement of linker-helix α <dig> so as to render helix α <dig> available for dimerization.fig.  <dig> diagrammatic representation of the narl constructs used in this study.  ribbon representation of narl , created using pymol  <cit> . the rd is colored blue, the linker region in red, and the od in yellow. the interdomain interface masks the dna binding elements of the α <dig> recognition helix, while the linker blocks the α <dig> dimerization helix. the site of phosphorylation, asp <dig>  is represented by molecular spheres. the region between helices α6-α <dig> was too disordered to be resolved.  the constructs used in this study are designated by colored bars following the same color scheme as in . residue range is indicated, as is the corresponding secondary structure. arrows in the secondary structure diagram represent β-strands while cylinders represent α-helices



most rrs are governed by their oligomeric state before and after phosphorylation, and integral to this process is the oligomeric state of the rd. in rrs that act as transcription factors, phosphorylation usually results in rd dimerization, which serves to either enhance or directly stimulate dna-binding and, hence, transcriptional activity  <cit> . consistently, precluding rd dimerization by mutagenesis compromises these functions . phosphorylation-induced rd dimerization occurs regardless of whether the od is initially inhibited by the rd in the unphosphorylated state, such as in fixj and phob  <cit> , or is expected to be uninhibited in the unphosphorylated state, such as in ompr and phop . the difference is that isolated ods that are otherwise inhibited in the full-length protein often have some level of intrinsic function. for example, the isolated od of phob activates transcription of phoa and the presence of rd dimers enhances this activity  <cit> . in contrast, the ompr od binds dna weakly and is unable to activate transcription without its rd  <cit> . little is known about the oligomeric state of the narl rd after phosphorylation, nor of its role in transcriptional regulation. the narl od, as shown by lin and stewart  <cit> , is able to confer in vivo transcriptional activation at some promoters in the presence of nitrate, such as the napf promoter, and, to a lesser extent, at the year promoter. thus, there has been evidence that independent function of the isolated narl od is variable and promoter dependent, and therefore the role of the rd may be as well. we sought to further investigate this idea by examining the ability of the narl od to regulate transcription at two specific promoter regions: the fumarate reductase  promoter where narl acts as a repressor in the presence of nitrate, and the nitrate reductase  promoter where narl acts as an activator in the presence of nitrate.

in this study, we examine the roles of the narl od, rd, and linker region in protein function and transcriptional regulation. protein truncations of the isolated od and rd, containing various portions of the linker, were created. these constructs were tested for their ability to regulate the in vivo expression of frda-lacz or narg-lacz reporter fusion genes, in the presence or absence of nitrate, as compared to the full-length protein. these assays demonstrated that the narl od alone was sufficient to repress frda-lacz expression, regardless of nitrate availability. incremental additions of the linker to the od reversed frda-lacz repression and also impaired dna binding. at the narg promoter, gene activation required the activities of both the od and rd. a footprint assay showed that optimal binding of the od to narg induction sites required the phosphorylated rd, which was also shown to form dimers by analytical ultracentrifugation. the variation of independent function by the narl od at the two promoters leads to the conclusion that the narl rd has promoter specific functions that can extend beyond blocking and releasing the od.

RESULTS
the narl od represses frda expression but is unable to activate narg expression
in the e. coli cell, the presence of nitrate triggers phosphorylation of narl by narx. phosphorylated narl  subsequently activates genes involved in nitrate respiration and represses the expression of genes encoded for alternative respiratory pathways  <cit> . at the frda promoter for the fumarate reductase operon, narl-p acts as a transcriptional repressor. it binds to several target dna binding sites that are located near the transcription start site, one of which is a high-affinity 7-2- <dig> site   <cit> . to determine whether the narl od can confer independent transcriptional regulation at this promoter in vivo, different narl c-terminal domain  constructs were evaluated for their ability to implement nitrate-dependent repression of an frda-lacz reporter fusion gene. the narlc constructs contained various linker lengths  , ranging from the shortest, which contained a small portion of the linker ), to the longest, which contained the entire linker region ). an additional construct included helix α <dig> of the rd ). the narl n-terminal domain plus linker region  was included as a negative control. wild-type narl displayed a 15-fold decrease in frda-lacz promoter activity in the presence of nitrate, as opposed to the full induction of this gene in the absence of nitrate when narl is unphosphorylated. in contrast, all narlc constructs tested at this promoter lacked a nitrate-dependent response as demonstrated by their constitutive repressive behavior . additionally, these derivative proteins displayed two patterns of activity. those missing the α5-α <dig> loop  and narlc ) bestowed a level of repression comparable to that of wild-type. those containing the α5-α <dig> loop  and narlc ), resulted in intermediate expression; that is, their ability to repress transcription decreased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, as compared to wild-type narl. as expected, narln was unable to repress expression since it lacked the dna recognition domain. these results demonstrate that the narl od, tolerant of a certain amount of attached linker, is sufficient to repress frda transcription and does so in a constitutive manner.fig.  <dig> the ability of the narl protein constructs to repress frda-lacz or activate narg-lacz.  transcription factor binding sites along the frda and narg promoters. black inverted arrows represent narl high-affinity, 7-2- <dig> binding arrangements; white arrows represent narl non-7-2- <dig> sites or narl single heptameric sites; light gray inverted arrows represent fnr sites, a dark gray trapezoid represents the ihf binding site; white rectangular boxes represent fis binding sites. the scale denotes nucleotides, and an arrow at the + <dig> nucleotide represents the transcription start site. information used to generate this image was taken from the ecocyc database  <cit>  and references therein.  the ability of the narl proteins to repress frda-lacz expression, or  to activate narg-lacz expression. narl truncated proteins were tested for anaerobic in vivo activity: the indicated lacz transcriptional reporter fusions were used in e. coli mc <dig> strains  harboring pacyc <dig> plasmid derivatives that contained narx and either narl+ or the indicated truncated narl derivative. levels of activity are measured in nmol ompg hydrolyzed per min per mg protein. white bars indicate activity in the absence of nitrate, gray bars indicate activity in the presence of nitrate. vector refers to parent plasmid pacyc <dig> run as a control. error bars  represent one standard deviation, based on the mean value for at least three repeat experiments



at the narg promoter for the nitrate reductase operon, narl-p acts as a transcriptional activator. here, the consensus dna binding sites are located upstream from the transcription start site and lack any 7-2- <dig> sites . when the different narl proteins were evaluated for their ability to activate transcription of a narg-lacz reporter fusion gene in vivo, none of the narlc proteins stimulated transcription relative to wild-type narl . narlc  and narlc  conferred a slight elevation of activity in the absence of nitrate when compared to the vector control, but showed the same low level expression pattern. in contrast, wild-type narl gave rise to a 20-fold increase in activity in response to the presence of nitrate. as expected, the narln control was unable to activate narg-lacz gene expression. these results show that the rd is essential for narl to activate the narg operon. western blot analysis for these and the above transcription assays showed that all of the narx and narl proteins were expressed in vivo, and in relatively uniform concentrations .

the narl rd is required for proper binding to the narg promoter region
one reason for the lack of narg activation by all of the narlc constructs may be due to poor binding at this promoter region. previous dnase i footprint analyses of the narg promoter has revealed two areas of protection by narl-p: a high affinity site centered in the − <dig> region and a lower affinity site centered in the − <dig> region  <cit> . occupancy of both regions is necessary for full induction of narg transcription, in addition to other transcription factors, such as fnr and ihf that must also bind to the region  <cit> . to determine whether the isolated narl od is capable of binding these critical regions, a dnase i protection assay was performed using a  <dig> base-pair fragment containing the narg promoter region . binding patterns of narlc , narl, and narl-p were compared. narl-p clearly protected both the − <dig> and − <dig> regions , including regions around − <dig>  while unphosphorylated narl did not produce any protection pattern. narlc  conferred a strong yet different protection pattern at the − <dig> region, and displayed much weaker protection at the − <dig> region as compared to narl-p. this weak interaction primarily resulted from alterations in hypersensitive sites and not by typical zones of protection. although narl-p and narlc  both bind the − <dig> site with the same relative affinity, their different binding pattern may be suggestive of improper occupancy by narlc . at the − <dig> region, narl-p binds more extensively and with a stronger affinity. the compromised binding by the od at the − <dig> region signifies at least one reason for the inability of narlc  to activate narg-lacz expression. at this promoter region, the phosphorylated rd is required to impart enhanced binding affinity and full occupancy.fig.  <dig> dnase i protection patterns for narlc , narl, and narl-p. binding to a  <dig> base pair fragment containing the narg promoter region is shown. the vertical bars indicate the two major regions of protection seen for narl-p, which are not as strong or as extensive in narlc . dotted lines highlight areas of protection. asterisks indicate altered banding patterns or hypersensitive bands for narl-p. arrows indicate altered banding patterns for narlc . maxam-gilbert g-reactions performed on the same dna fragment were used as size markers. coordinates relative to the transcription start site are given in base-pairs, and protein concentrations are indicated



loop α5-α <dig> inhibits dna binding of the narl od
the impaired frda-lacz repression by narlc constructs containing loop α5-α <dig>  indicates that these proteins weakly bind dna as compared to narlc domains lacking this linker segment. to further investigate the effect of loop α5-α <dig> on dna binding, we performed an emsa using the previously constructed oligonucleotide containing the engineered narg −89/− <dig> sequence  <cit> . narlc , which bestows full frda-lacz repression , binds to this sequence with equivalent binding affinity as wild-type narl-p in a dnase i footprint assay  <cit> , and co-crystallizes with this 7-2- <dig> site as a dimer  <cit> . therefore, this oligonucleotide serves as a useful standard to compare the relative binding affinities of the narlc constructs used in this study. the emsa shows that narlc , which contains helix α <dig>  bound dna with equivalent binding affinity as the narlc  control . consistent with the results of the in vivofrda-lacz expression assay, the presence of helix α <dig> did not impair dna binding. in contrast, narlc  bound dna less tightly, supporting the hypothesis that loop α5-α <dig> exerts an inhibition on the narl od. the same results were observed by the narlc truncation proteins when the 6-tag was placed at the c-terminal end , suggesting that the inhibition by the α5-α <dig> loop is not due to the 6-tag. furthermore, narlc  and narlc  are expected to have adopted an overall correct fold .fig.  <dig> the affect of linker loop α5-α <dig> on narlc binding to dna. an emsa illustrates the relative binding affinities of the indicated narlc proteins to a 32p-labeled dna fragment containing an engineered 7-2- <dig> narg −89/- <dig> binding site. lanes 1– <dig> show increasing concentrations of the specified narlc protein . the binding affinities of narlc  and narlc , containing helix α <dig>  are equivalent while that of narlc , containing helix α <dig> and loop α5-α <dig>  is relatively reduced



the narl rd dimerizes in solution while the narl od is monomeric
in several rrs, phosphorylation of the rd enhances dna binding. this is often accompanied by, or a direct result of, rd dimerization  <cit> . therefore, the requirement of the phosphorylated rd to achieve optimal narl binding at the narg promoter may involve rd dimerization. to determine if the narl rd is able to dimerize and to gain further insight into the narl phosphorylation mechanism, analytical ultracentrifugation was applied to narln and narl in native and phosphorylated states, and to the narlc constructs.

narln, containing the rd and linker-helix α <dig>  has a sequence molecular-mass of  <dig>  kda. when examined by analytical ultracentrifugation at a concentration of 60 μm, the narln speed dependent molecular-masses were  <dig>  kda ,  <dig>  kda , and  <dig>  kda  which were best fit by a monomer and dimer . at the corresponding centrifugation speeds, phosphorylated narln  gave apparent molecular masses of  <dig>  kda,  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, and were best fit by a population largely in the dimeric form. when examined at 160 μm, similar results were observed and with reasonably good residuals. unphosphorylated narln had apparent molecular-masses of  <dig>  kda  and  <dig>  kda , while those for narln-p were  <dig>  kda  and  <dig>  kda . the slightly lower-than-expected measured molecular masses for narln-p  were somewhat surprising. narln-p autophosphorylates more efficiently with acetyl phosphate than full-length narl , is observably more soluble, and remains phosphorylated for at least 12 hours and gradually dephosphorylates over a period of several days  <cit> . although partial loss of phosphorylation in these experiments may have occurred, the observation that unphosphorylated narln consistently displayed 50 % dimeric behavior demonstrates that this domain can form dimers when liberated from the od. phosphorylation then serves to increase the population of rd dimers.table  <dig> summary of sedimentation equilibrium resultsa,b

full-length unphosphorylated narl was monomeric at 60 μm and 160 μm, with a measured molecular-mass of  <dig>  kda at  <dig>  rpm, and with small fitting residuals . its sequence molecular-mass is  <dig>  kda. consistent results were also observed at the same two concentrations and at  <dig>  rpm. attempts to determine the oligomeric state of narl-p repeatedly showed that it was dimeric, and perhaps contained a small population of tetramer. however, the results were deemed inconclusive due to the heterogeneity of the sample and the inability to rule out protein aggregation.

as mentioned, the narlc  domain co-crystallizes with a dna 7-2- <dig> site as a dimer  <cit> ; but whether this truncation protein can dimerize in the absence of dna has not been demonstrated. the molecular mass of narlc  was determined by sedimentation to be  <dig>  kda at 60 μm and  <dig>  rpm, which is identical to its sequence molecular mass. this domain, therefore, remains monomeric in solution . no salt conditions tested were found to promote dimerization, and narlc  was also predominantly monomeric at 160 μm and  <dig>  rpm. to test whether the linker region affects narlc dimerization, the narlc  construct, which contains the entire linker region, was also examined by sedimentation. the molecular mass of narlc  was determined at  <dig>  rpm and 60 μm to be  <dig>  kda  and  <dig>  kda at 160 μm. compared to its sequence molecular-mass of  <dig>  kda, narlc  was also predominately monomeric. residuals from the exponential fitting were small, indicating little molecular mass heterogeneity. for both narlc constructs, additional data were taken at speeds of  <dig>  rpm and  <dig>  rpm, which gave similar results. taken together, these sedimentation results demonstrate that narlc, either alone or with the linker attached, is predominantly monomeric in solution.

discussion
the roles of the narl rd are promoter specific
our in vivo and in vitro results indicate that the narl rd performs different functions to regulate transcription, which depend on the requirements governing specific promoter regions. this idea is summarized in fig.  <dig>  which depicts the roles of the od and rd at the preferred sites of the frda and narg promoters. transcriptional repression of frda presumably involves occlusion of rna polymerase and the transcriptional activator fnr at the transcription start site  <cit> . according to our results, this repression can be accomplished merely with a liberated od, which can include linker-helix α <dig> . the narl rd is not required for these functions. instead, the role of the rd at this promoter is to prevent uncontrolled gene repression by sequestering the od in the absence of nitrate. the rd essentially acts as a phosphorylation controlled on-off switch that transitions from the open to closed form of the protein, respectively, in response to nitrate availability. rd dimerization is proposed to occur and may do so to maintain the open form of the protein.fig.  <dig> the roles of the od and rd at the frda and narg promoter regions. narl is represented by a cartoon figure: the od is depicted by a yellow circle; the linker region is in red, with the α5-α <dig> loop shown as a squiggle and helix α <dig> as a cylinder; the rd is shown as a blue irregular octagon with phosphorylation represented by a “p”. for simplicity, only preferred binding sites or regions are designated at each promoter, which are not drawn to scale. the transcription start site is indicated by an arrow.  the frda promoter. top panel: wild-type, phosphorylated, narl binds to the frda promoter region, leading to gene repression in a nitrate responsive manner. bottom panel: narlc  is also able to repress frda gene expression, but does so in a constitutive manner. the ods are shown to dimerize at the 7-2- <dig>  binding region near the transcription start site.  the narg promoter. top panel: wild-type, phosphorylated, narl binds the essential − <dig> and − <dig> regions of the narg promoter to activate gene expression. the rd is presumed to dimerize and may also engage in other protein-protein interactions that are not depicted in the diagram. bottom panel: narlc  cannot activate the narg promoter due to improper binding at the − <dig> region. therefore narg operon expression remains low or non-activated in the absence of a phosphorylated rd



in contrast, the same narlc constructs that conferred strong constitutive repression of frda-lacz ) were unable to activate narg-lacz expression and their behavior was not constitutive. based on our footprint experiment, the lack of narg activation by these constructs is at least attributed to their inability to properly bind the essential − <dig> region. thus, release of the sequestered narl od alone is insufficient to induce transcription of the narg operon; rather, the presence of the narl rd is also mandatory for transcriptional activation . at this promoter, the narl rd is required for optimal dna binding and occupancy, which may be facilitated by rd dimerization. another possible role for the rd at this promoter, though not exclusive of the first, is that the narl rd may be required to bend dna or may be involved in cooperative interactions. cooperativity at the narg promoter is thought to occur via narl oligomerization along the dna in conjunction with dna bending by ihf  <cit> . the narl rd may be required for such functions, and possibly other protein-protein interactions. similarly, the receiver domain of the rr todt, a member of the narl/fixj family, is required to induce a hairpin bend at its promoter region that is stabilized by ihf and is required for transcription  <cit> .

at the narg promoter, narl is reminiscent of rrs with unblocked ods in the pre-phosphorylated state, such as ompr or uhpa, which can bind dna  but require phosphorylation to enhance binding and bestow full transcriptional activation . in other words, sequestering the narl od from binding to the narg promoter is not as important as sequestering it from binding to the frda promoter. therefore, a response regulator having a sequestered od does not necessarily indicate that the od has intrinsic function at all times. likewise, the od of devr , a homologue of narl, is also inhibited in the inactive state, but during hypoxia the devr od alone is unable to activate transcription of genes that require cooperativity  <cit> . cooperative binding requires the devr rd. thus, in situations where the narl od has little to no intrinsic function, the narl rd has an additional regulatory role, the extent of which varies between promoter regions.

our results are also consistent with the aforementioned narl studies by lin and stewart  <cit>  that showed different extents of od activity at the napf verses year promoters. narlc alone was able to fully activate napf and only partially activate year despite both having a 7–2– <dig> binding site upstream of the transcription start site . this also implies ﻿that the functions of the narl rd depend more on promoter specificity than on the location of the narl binding sites. discrepant roles for the rd at different promoter regions have also been observed or implicated in other rrs. unphosphorylated phop, which does not have a blocked od, can bind dna derived from the phop promoter, but requires a phosphorylated rd to bind dna derived from the msl <dig> promoter. the rd of fixj was proposed to be dispensable at the nifa promoter  <cit> , since, when liberated, the od was able to confer gene activation comparable to wild-type levels. however phosphorylation-induced rd dimerization of fixj significantly raised the binding affinity of fixj to fixk and is expected to be vital at this promoter  <cit> .

helix α <dig> verses loop α5-α6
we investigated the affects of specific linker segments on narl od function and found discrepant activities between od constructs containing linker helix α <dig> verses those containing linker loop α5-α <dig>  the presence of helix α <dig>  in narlc , bestowed similar behavior to that seen in narlc , which lacks this helix and is known to fold correctly from its crystal structure  <cit> . since both narlc  and narlc  showed constitutive repression of frda-lacz expression and similar dna binding in vitro, this indicates that narlc  also folded correctly. supporting evidence that narlc  ) folded correctly stems from the nmr structure of the erwinia amylovora rcsb od and linker segment, which shows structural homology to the corresponding region  in full-length narl  <cit> . therefore, helix α <dig> in narlc  is predicted to form hydrophobic contacts with helix α <dig>  which, in this form, blocks od dimerization. these modest interactions, however, could render helix α <dig> flexible and account for its apparent movement that enabled narlc  to function properly. thus, our data support the expected relocation of helix α <dig> upon narl phosphorylation that would enable od dimerization on dna via helix α <dig>  <cit> .

in contrast, the addition of loop α5-α <dig>  such as in narlc , compromised frda-lacz repression in vivo and weakened dna binding to a high affinity 7–2– <dig> site in vitro. this may be explained by the hydrogen bond between m <dig> in linker loop α5-α <dig> and g <dig> in loop α7-α <dig> of the od , which is the only remaining contact for loop α5-α <dig> once the rd is removed. this hydrogen bond, presumably present in narlc , may partially anchor the od in this region and impart the relative intermediate inhibition observed. by this activation model, release of the od upon narl phosphorylation entails severing contacts between the od and loop α5-α <dig>  this activation mechanism also correlates with our previous epr studies whereby phosphorylation was proposed to induce a hinge bending movement in the vicinity of the gly <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, linker involvement at the domain interface and activation mechanism has also been shown in other rrs. in cheb, the linker contributes to the interface and mutations to it can result in methylesterase activity that bypasses phosphorylation  <cit> . helix α <dig> of full-length vrar  is thought to stabilize the interdomain interface, and activation by beryllofluoride unwinds this helix as part of releasing the od  <cit> . likewise is observed for the full-length structure of spr <dig> in s. pneumonia where the presumed semi-activated form shows a conformational change of the same helix α <dig> and the loop which follows  <cit> .fig.  <dig> hydrogen bond contacts in the region of loop α5-α <dig>  residues 126– <dig> within the α5-α <dig> loop  form hydrogen bond contacts  with both the rd  and od  of narl. an interdomain contact between r <dig> and g <dig> is also depicted. removal of the rd abolishes the hydrogen bonds in this region except that of m <dig> and g170



CONCLUSIONS
based on our results, we propose that phosphorylation of narl has a dual purpose, to relieve od inhibition and to enable rd homodimers. liberation of the od would entail severing contacts between the rd and od as wells as between the linker and od. once separated, the domains play independent, yet concerted, roles in regulating gene expression. liberation of the od alone is sufficient to control some promoters, while control of other promoters requires additional events involving the receiver domain. thus, the rd can act as a molecular switch or bestow additional complex functions, such as increasing the dna binding affinity and forming other protein-protein interactions, which render it completely necessary for stimulating transcription.
