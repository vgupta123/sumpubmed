BACKGROUND
tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer-fly fever, is caused by the gram-negative intracellular pathogen francisella tularensis , which is highly infectious and considered as a potential bioweapon. currently there are four recognized subspecies of f. tularensis: subsp. tularensis, holarctica, mediasiatica and novicida. the former two subspecies are clinically important. f. tularensis is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere and is capable of infecting hundreds of different vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . in addition, a variety of arthropods, including multiple genera of ticks as well as deer flies, fleas, mites, and mice, have been found to be naturally infected or experimentally competent as vectors. in many endemic areas, ticks play an important role in transmission of the disease from animals to humans  <cit> , with the genera amblyomma, dermacentor, haemaphysalis, ixodes and ornithodoros acting as main vectors  <cit> .

in china, f. tularensis was isolated in citellus dauricus from tongliao region, inner mongolia municipality as early as in  <dig>  <cit> . the first human tularemia epidemic, including  <dig> reported cases, which was caused by contact with infected hares, was reported in heilongjiang province in  <dig>  <cit> . the natural foci of the disease were subsequently identified in tibet and xinjiang municipalities  <cit> . the agent was detected and isolated from patients, ixodex liberelis, dermacentor marginatus and wolly hares  from qinghai province and tibet, xinjiang autonomous regions during 1962– <dig>  <cit> . an outbreak of tularemia occurred in shandong province in  <dig>  all the  <dig> reported patients were workers in a food-processing factory, where hares were slaughtered and processed  <cit> . serological investigations demonstrated that the seropositive reaction to f. tularensis was significantly associated with tick exposure  <cit> . however, little is known about the prevalence of f. tularensis in ticks in china, lack of such information has inhibited our fully understanding of the disease ecology and also under-estimated the threat of the pathogen to human health where ticks are abundant. in the present study, we try to investigate the presence of f. tularensis in ticks, and then to identify their genotypes using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis .

RESULTS
prevalence of f. tularensis in ticks
out of  <dig> adult ticks examined, thirty three were positive for the fopa gene of f. tularensis. the overall positive rate was  <dig> %. all positive samples amplified the 220-bp fragment for the ppi-helicase gene that identifies f. tularensis subsp.holarctica . thus, all ticks in the present study were infected with f. tularensis subsp.holarctica. the positive rates of f. tularensis in d. silvarum were  <dig> % and  <dig> % in i. persulatus , while all of the  <dig> haemaphysalis verticalis and  <dig> boophilus microplus were pcr-negative. the difference in positive rates among different species was significant . we were able to detect f. tularensis in ticks from jilin, heilongjiang and inner mongolia, but not from fujian during the present study. the positive rates varied according to their geographical origins , with minor statistical significance .

---, no ticks captured

mlva
two f. tularensis mlva markers  were successfully amplified from the  <dig> samples that tested positive for both the fopa gene and ppi-helicase pcrs. the sequences from ft-m <dig> were invariant,  <dig> copies and  <dig> bp in size , same as previously reported  <cit> . the ft-m <dig> loci had two allelic variants , exactly as defined by johansson for f. tularensis subsp. holarctica  <cit> . the sequence size from ft-m <dig> ranged greatly from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and the repeating units differed from  <dig> to  <dig> copies . based on the copy numbers of two loci, seven genotypes were identified . the ft-m <dig> genotype containing  <dig> repeat copies was detected at  <dig> study sites in over half of the f. tularensis positive ticks . the significance of this genotype-host association remains unknown. different genotypes could be detected from the same location , among which, one ft-m <dig> genotype containing  <dig> repeat copies from i. persulcatus was unique which had been found existence in f. tularensis subsp. tularesnsis in goethert's study  <cit> .

discussion
although f. tularensis can be cultured in the laboratory, it requires enriched growth media and bsl <dig> facilities for isolation, these problems, together with the difficulty of recognizing the bacterium make it lack rapid and safe methods for laboratory identification  <cit> . nowadays, various pcr approaches amplifying different genomic segments have been applied to detecting f. tularensis  <cit> . the evaluations were performed during epidemics in sweden in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. it proved pcr detection of f. tularensis was more sensitive than culture  <cit> . in present study, nested-pcr method which targeting fopa gene of f. tualrensis  <cit>  was used to detect f. tularensis in ticks from four provinces of china. we were able to detect f. tualrensis in d. silvarum and i. persulcatus from three northern provinces of china. the prevalence in ticks was  <dig> %, which is comparable with the prevalence of  <dig> %– <dig> % in d. reticulates from european countries  <cit> . actually, as early as  <dig>  during an epidemical survey we have detected f. tularensis in rodents from these three provinces  <cit> . the present findings, combined with our previous detection result in rodents, adds evidence to our belief that tularemia may be only confined to the northern part of china. during our study, we were able to detect f. tularensis in d. silvarum and i. persulatus, whereas not from haemaphysalis verticalis and boophilus microplus. moreover, the f. tularensis strains in china were mainly isolated from these two tick genera  <cit> . the principal tick vectors seemed only include the genus dermacentor and ixodes in china, because we have found no evidence that other tick genera was involved in f. tularensis to date.

for the first time, our study identified the infection of f. tularensis in ticks from jilin province. actually, natural infection of f. tularensis in rodents had been recorded from same study sites in  <dig>  <cit> . geographically, jilin province is adjacent to heilongjiang province where first human tularemia cases were reported and natural focus was established as early as in  <dig>  <cit> . the study sites from two provinces were close to each other and they have the same ecological environment. so it was not surprising that we were able to detect f. tularensis in ticks from jilin province. however, it is still too early to state that tularemia natural focus exists in jilin province because until now we have not obtained the isolate and there is no any case report.

tandem repeat regions are known to be highly variable and successfully used for typing bacterial species, even for discriminating individual isolates  <cit> . during our study, two loci  were used to measure the genetic diversity of f. tularensis detected in the study. the sequence of the 16-bp repeating unit of ft-m <dig> was invariant, this result was consistent with our previous study results  <cit> . perhaps there was only one variant from ft-m <dig> locus among chinese f. tularensis, although about  <dig> variants had been identified  <cit> , among which  <dig> variants for f. tularensis subsp. holarctica were identified  <cit> .  <dig> variants were identified for  <dig> positive samples from ft-m <dig> locus, among which one unique type containing  <dig> repeat copies was firstly identified in f. tularensis subsp. holarctica, this type had been identified from f. tularensis subsp. tularensis infected tick samples in goethert's study  <cit> . according to the sequences, we are sure that the f. tularensis detected in present study can all be grouped as the f. tularensis subsp. holarctica , not f. tularensis subsp. tularensis. the type containing  <dig> repeat copies from ft-m <dig> locus seemed to be dominant in the detected ticks, actually in goethert's study they had identified one genotype  only existing in ticks, which belonged to f. tularensis subsp.tularensis . a variety of samples should be included to illuminate whether there are differences in various genotype among host ranges.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed the role of two tick species in harboring the pathogen of tularemia in natural environment in china. in endemic foci where these genera ticks are abundant, public health officials and clinicians should be alert to the presence of tularemia, although it is not notifiable disease in china. in addition, mlva results disclosed the genetic diversity of detected f. tularensis and identified one dominant genotype existing in ticks. future work will involve more markers other than ft-m <dig> and ft-m <dig> detected in multiple-labs so to make comparisons with isolates of worldwide origin possible  <cit> .
