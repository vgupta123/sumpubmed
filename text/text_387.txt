BACKGROUND
bordetella bronchiseptica, bordetella parapertussis and bordetella pertussis are closely related respiratory pathogens that infect mammalian species.b. bronchiseptica causes chronic respiratory tract infections in a wide variety of mammals but has only been sporadically isolated from humans  <cit> . b. parapertussis consists of two distinct lineages that infect sheep and humans, respectively  <cit> . b. pertussisis is a human pathogen that causes pertussis, also known as whooping cough, a disease that is particularly severe in infants.

for about  <dig> years, many countries have been immunizing young children with pertussis vaccines to control disease. despite vaccination, pertussis remains endemic, with regular epidemic outbreaks. world-wide, whooping cough causes up to  <dig>  deaths every year, mostly among unvaccinated infants  <cit> . even in countries with a high vaccination coverage, a significant increase in the pertussis incidence has been observed since the 1990s  <cit> . in the netherlands, such an increase in pertussis has been observed since  <dig>  <cit> .

the resurgence of pertussis in countries with high vaccination coverage has been attributed to a number of factors, including increased awareness with regard to the disease, improved diagnostics, waning vaccine-induced immunity and pathogen adaptation  <cit> . consistent with pathogen adaptation, numerous studies have demonstrated that the b. pertussis population has changed in several countries where vaccination has been implemented since the 1950s  <cit> . in particular, antigenic divergence was found between circulating strains and vaccine strains with respect to pertussis toxin  and pertactin .

in the netherlands this divergence between vaccine and circulating strains has played a role in the reemergence of pertussis  <cit> . more recent studies have also found polymorphism in other surface proteins, including tracheal colonization factor a   <cit> , the serotype  <dig> and  <dig> fimbrial subunits   <cit>  and in the promoter region for the ptx operon  <cit> . the latter mutation was found in the netherlands since the 1990s and we observed that strains with a particular allele of the ptx promoter , i.e. ptxp <dig>  have expanded in the dutch b. pertussis population. the increase in frequency of ptxp <dig> strains coincided with the increase in pertussis notifications in the netherlands. moreover b. pertussis strains carrying this novel allele for the pertussis toxin promoter were shown to confer increased virulence  <cit> .

in recent years genomic tools like dna microarrays have been used for comparison of the genetic composition of different strains within a species. several microarray-platforms have been developed and applied to specifically address questions related to the genome of b. pertussis  <cit> .

in the study presented here we used multi-locus sequence typing , multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis  and a microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  method to investigate the heterogeneity of the strains dominating the current dutch pertussis epidemics, in particularly the ptxp <dig> strains. we have developed an oligonucleotide microarray representing 94% of the gene repertoire of the b. pertussis tohama i strain, of which the genome has been sequenced  <cit> . this microarray allowed us to study the gene contents of the strains involved in the dutch epidemics and thus to identify  polymorphic loci associated with epidemic phenotype. representative dutch isolates from  <dig> to  <dig> were selected since pertussis epidemics have been occurring regularly in the netherlands since  <dig>  we aimed to identify mlst, mlva and gene profiles associated with the dutch epidemics and to determine the characteristics and heterogeneity of those epidemic strains.

RESULTS
dutch strains were selected from the period 1993– <dig>  the period 1993– <dig> was characterized by a relative low level of notifications. in  <dig> a sudden increase in notifications was observed and this high level has been maintained until today  <cit> .

mlst analyses
three genes known to be polymorphic in the period 1993– <dig>  ptxp, fim <dig> and prn, were selected for the mlst analysis of  <dig> strains. the ptxp gene occurred as two alleles, ptxp <dig> and ptxp <dig>  the fim <dig> gene occurred as four alleles , while three prn alleles were observed .

we observed  <dig> different mlst-profiles in the period from  <dig> to  <dig> . a number of mlsts  were found in low frequencies in the whole period  and combined into a single group designated r. the highest frequency of the minor mlsts  was found in  <dig>  for clarity, we will discuss first discuss mlsts with ptxp <dig>  followed by those harboring ptxp <dig>  strains with the ptxp <dig> allele were gradually replaced by ptxp <dig> strains, which were predominant from  <dig> on. the ptxp <dig> allele was linked to fim3- <dig>  and three prn alleles, prn <dig>  prn <dig> and prn <dig> . mlst <dig> predominated until  <dig>  and showed a gradual decrease in frequency from  <dig> to  <dig>  after which it was not detected. mlst <dig> was detected in the period 1994– <dig> . mlst <dig> strains were found in the whole period, with the exception of the years  <dig> and  <dig>  in frequencies of 8%–22%.

in contrast to ptxp <dig>  ptxp <dig> was linked to two fim <dig> alleles, fim3- <dig> and fim3- <dig> . as was observed for ptxp <dig>  ptxp <dig> was associated with prn <dig>  prn <dig> and prn <dig> . thus in contrast to ptxp <dig>  ptxp <dig> was mostly linked to prn <dig>  two predominant mlsts associated with ptxp <dig> were observed, mlst <dig> and mlst <dig>  mlst <dig> was found throughout the whole period and predominated in  <dig> and  <dig> . mlst <dig> was first detected in  <dig>  and predominated in the period  <dig> to  <dig> .

mlva analyses
a collection of  <dig> clinical isolates from the period  <dig> to  <dig> were typed by mlva and  <dig> types were found. of the  <dig> mlva types,  <dig> have not been described before . most types  were found in a single isolate only and these were combined into a single group, designated r . the remaining four types mlva <dig>  mlva <dig>  mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> were found in frequencies of, respectively, 4%, 41%, 30% and 4% in the whole period. in the period 1993– <dig>  mlva <dig> was found in frequencies of 16%–58%, but was not observed in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . it was the predominant type in the year  <dig> . mlva <dig> was not detected in  <dig> and was observed in frequencies of 18% to 78% in the other years. it was the predominant type from  <dig> to  <dig>  compared to mlva <dig> and mlva <dig>  mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> were detected in much lower frequencies , and only in the years 1993– <dig>  in  <dig> the highest frequency of minor types was observed .

the genetic diversity based on mlva types showed a decrease from approximately 80% in the early nineties to 42% in  <dig> and  <dig> .

the relationship between mlst and mlva types was investigated by constructing a minimum spanning tree based on mlva-types of  <dig> b. pertussis strains . two main clusters were observed. the majority of the strains in cluster  <dig> belonged to the related mlva types  <dig> and  <dig>  most of the strains  of mlva type  <dig> and  <dig> had the ptxp <dig> allele . similarly, most strains in cluster  <dig> belonged to the related mlva types  <dig> and  <dig> and most  of the strains of these mlva types carried ptxp <dig> allele .

cgh analyses
microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  with the b. pertussis oligonucleotide microarray based on the tohama i genome was used for genomic analyses of the ptxp <dig> and ptxp <dig> lineages in order to determine if they differed with respect to gene content. forty-three dutch clinical isolates, isolated in the period 1993– <dig>  were analyzed with cgh, seventeen ptxp <dig> strains and twenty-six ptxp <dig> strains. complete hybridization profiles for twenty-five b. pertussis isolates are presented in fig.  <dig>  of the  <dig>  genes spotted on the microarray,  <dig>  were found to be absent in at least one of the b. pertussis strains tested. the  <dig> genes were clustered in eight contiguous loci or regions of difference  .

regions of difference  are numbered according to brinig et al  <cit> . rd-1* is part of rd- <dig> as was found by brinig et al  <cit> . the percentage of strains harbouring the region and the number of strains analyzed are indicated. size, refers to the size of the deletion.

all strains isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> contained a deletion in two rds relative to the tohama i strain: rd- <dig>  and rd- <dig>  the  <dig> gene products of rd- <dig>  were classified in gene class groups . four  cell envelope proteins, three  regulators and  <dig>  proteins involved in transport and binding were observed. five  proteins were hypothetical proteins, seven  were proteins with an unclassified function. one gene product  is involved in central intermediary metabolism and one  in energy metabolism. four of the genes  were pseudo genes in tohama i. the rd- <dig> contained seven genes , including three  genes, classified in the category transport and binding, coding for proteins involved in iron transport . two genes  in rd- <dig> are pseudo genes in tohama i . rd- <dig> and rd- <dig> are both flanked by is <dig> in tohama i, on one side and both sides, respectively.

the number of genes belonging to cog classes is indicated for each rd, for all rds combined  and for tohama i  <cit> . in the last column the % of each class present in all rds relative to tohama i is indicated.

the ptxp <dig> and ptxp <dig> lineages were distinguished by rd- <dig>  a region comprising  <dig> genes and  <dig>  kb . rd- <dig> was present in all ptxp <dig> strains analyzed. the ptxp <dig> allele is linked to two fim <dig> alleles, fim3- <dig> and fim3- <dig>  and rd- <dig> is absent in all strains belonging to these lineages. hierarchical clustering based on cgh data using pearson correlation grouped the ptxp <dig> and the ptxp <dig> lineages separately . of the  <dig> genes in rd- <dig> , four  genes were classified in energy metabolism, four  genes were involved in transport and binding. further several single genes  coded for a putative exported protein, a transcriptional regulator and a protein involved in iron transport, respectively . five of the  <dig> genes  were pseudo genes in tohama i. rd- <dig> is flanked by is <dig> elements on both sides in the tohama i strain.

four genes present in rd- <dig>  were duplicated in the tohama i genome at positions bp0579-bp <dig>  <cit> . in agreement with this, the log ratio values for these genes in strains missing rd- <dig>  were intermediate between those for genes which were absent or present as a single copy, respectively. in contrast, identical log ratios were observed between tohama i and ptxp <dig> strains indicating that the genes encoded by bp0579-bp <dig> are also present at positions bp1955-bp <dig> in ptxp <dig> strains.

b. pertussis strains carrying the ptxp <dig> allele were isolated for the first time in the netherlands in  <dig>  in order to analyze the homogeneity of the ptxp <dig> strains further, we extended our microarray based cgh analysis to six strains carrying the ptxp <dig> allele isolated prior to  <dig> . as was observed for strains from the period  <dig> to  <dig>  rd- <dig> was missing in all  <dig> strains. an additional deletion of two genes  was observed in four of the early ptxp <dig> strains. the genes in bp <dig> and bp <dig> encode for a phage-related hypothetical protein and a hypothetical protein respectively .

the presence of rd- <dig> was investigated with pcr in, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> additional ptxp <dig> and ptxp <dig> strains. this set of strains included isolates from denmark, finland, france, sweden and the netherlands. in all cases the absence of rd- <dig> was linked to the ptxp <dig> allele.

interestingly, in strains missing rd- <dig>  the pcr spanning the deletion resulted in two distinct pcr fragments . dna sequencing showed that in the  <dig>  kb pcr fragment the genes flanking rd- <dig>  bp <dig> and bp <dig>  were separated by one copy of is <dig>  while in the  <dig>  kb pcr fragment, two copies of the is <dig> separated these genes . the second type was found only in strains isolated in 1993– <dig> 

a number of rds were found infrequently in  <dig> strains analyzed with cgh and were not linked to a particular lineage as defined by mlst or mlva; rd- <dig> , rd- <dig> , rd- <dig> , rd- <dig>  and rd- <dig>  . sequencing analysis showed that only part  of the rd- <dig> gene was deleted. the five rds contained  <dig> genes of which four  coded for proteins involved in transport and binding, five  for cell envelope proteins and four  for regulatory proteins. seven  of these  <dig> genes are pseudo genes . all loci were flanked by is <dig> sequences on at least one side in the tohama i strain. rd- <dig>  rd- <dig> and rd- <dig>  were each found in a single strain belonging to the ptxp <dig> lineage. rd- <dig> was found in  <dig> strains of the ptxp <dig> lineage. finally, rd- <dig> was found in both the ptxp <dig> lineage and the ptxp <dig> lineage in, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> strains. the number of pseudo genes found in the rds  was higher compared to the whole genome   <cit> .

discussion
in the netherlands the upsurge of pertussis was characterized by the expansion of strains carrying a novel allele for the ptx promoter , which completely replaced the resident ptxp <dig> strains  <cit> . it is possible that the ptxp <dig> allele has increased bacterial fitness and contributed to the upsurge of pertussis. however, the ptxp <dig> allele may also be linked to other polymorphic loci important for fitness. in this study we have characterized the ptxp <dig> and ptxp <dig> lineages using mlva, mlst and cgh, to establish genetic relationships and to identify loci uniquely associated with ptxp <dig> strains. further, this study highlights the microevolution of b. pertussis within closely related lineages.

the genetic diversity, based on mlva frequencies, of the b. pertussis population showed a gradual decrease in the period  <dig> to  <dig> from 80% to 40%. this reflects the expansion of ptxp3-fim3- <dig> strains, the population of which was less diverse than the ptxp1-fim3- <dig> and ptxp3-fim3- <dig> populations . the low genetic diversity of the ptxp3-fim3- <dig> population may reflect recent the expansion of a single clone, consistent with its recent appearance in the dutch population.

the emergence of fim3- <dig> has also been observed in canada and in russia  <cit> . in view of the many surface antigens expressed by b. pertussis, it is remarkable that a single amino acid change in fim <dig> may affect the competitive balance between strains. the alleles for the ptx s <dig> subunit and prn code for protein variants which differ in one to seven amino acids  <cit> , yet large changes in allele frequencies have been observed over the years, also suggesting that minor mutations may have a noticeable effect on strain fitness.

consistent with studies from other groups  <cit> , we observed a number for rds comprising large deletions in b. pertussis isolates which were flanked by one or more is <dig> copies. a comparison of these studies is complicated by the different designations used for the rds. we propose a common nomenclature for the rds observed in b. pertussis according to the article by brinig et al,  <cit> . in the latter work,  <dig> rds were described and we propose that novel rds should be numbered starting from rd- <dig>  here rds were numbered according to brinig et al  <cit> .

most frequent were deletions in rd- <dig>  rd- <dig> and rd- <dig>  rd- <dig> and rd- <dig> were absent from all analyzed strains isolated in the period  <dig> to  <dig>  rd- <dig> contains several genes that are predicted to be involved in iron uptake, which is essential for survival of most bacteria in the host. however, the b. pertussis genome contains several distinct gene clusters involved in iron uptake not all of which may be essential  <cit> . the absence of rd- <dig> was associated with ptxp <dig> strains. rd- <dig> is comprised of  <dig> genes, four of which are duplicated and found elsewhere in the tohama i chromosome: maleate cis-trans isomerase, a probable hydrolase , a conserved hypothetical protein and a putative isochorismatase. cgh and pcr analyses indicated that these four genes are duplicated in all strains analyzed belonging to the ptxp <dig> lineage. the duplication of part of rd- <dig> may have allowed the preservation of genes important for fitness. among the rd- <dig> genes lost in the ptxp <dig> lineage are those encoding for an abc transporter system an iron uptake protein a putative transcriptional regulator and a putative exported protein. the deleted segment did not harbor any known virulence-related genes, nevertheless some of these genes may be involved in virulence. abc transporter components can be surface associated and may be involved in virulence  <cit> .

in the ptxp <dig> strains the region flanking the rd- <dig> deletion occurred in two forms. in one form the dna regions flanking the deletion were separated by one is <dig> copy and in the second form by two is <dig> copies. the form with two is <dig> copies was found mostly in strains isolated in 1993– <dig> but not in strains isolated after that date. all strains isolated after  <dig> were found to have the one copy of is <dig> in this region. this suggests that the form with two copies of the is <dig> is the precursor form, from which the second form arose after a second recombination step.

a number of rds were deleted from one to six strains. the rd- <dig> deletion was observed in two strains characterized by the allele combinations ptxp1-fim3- <dig> and ptxp3-fim3- <dig>  respectively, and these deletions therefore may reflect independent genetic events, suggesting that deleting rd- <dig> is beneficial for the bacterium.

as yet it is not clear if and how these deletions affect fitness. as observed by others  <cit> , we found the deleted regions to be enriched for pseudo genes compared to the genome, suggesting  the deleted regions were not essential. further, the loss of  genes may increase fitness by lowering metabolic costs and the number of immune targets. in several bacterial species such as shigella, chlamydophila, mycobacterium tuberculosis, yersinia pestis and salmonella enterica, the absence of certain genes has been correlated with some beneficial effect such as an increase in pathogenicity or the onset of virulence  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
based on the combined results of the three typing methods, we present a model for the evolution of the ptxp <dig> and ptxp <dig> lineages . it was assumed that point mutations preceded the deletion of rds. further variation in prn was not used to derive relationships between strains, as it is caused by reversible insertion and deletion of repeat units and hence not a useful long-term phylogenic marker  <cit> . thus the tree is mainly based on two point mutations found in ptxp and fim <dig> resulting in three lineages, ptxp1-fim3- <dig>  ptxp3-fim3- <dig> and ptxp3-fim3- <dig>  the assumption that variation in prn occurs at relative high frequency and is reversible, is reflected by the occurrence of all three detected variants in the ptxp1-fim3- <dig> and ptxp3-fim3- <dig> lineages . however, the frequencies clearly differ, prn <dig> and prn <dig> predominating in, respectively, ptxp1-fim3- <dig> and ptxp3-fim3- <dig>  most of the strains in the ptxp3-fim3- <dig> lineage harbored prn <dig> , while prn <dig> was absent . clustering based on cgh and mlva both indicated that ptxp <dig> and ptxp <dig> strains represented distinct lineages. the ptxp3-fim3- <dig> and ptxp3-fim3- <dig> strains could not be distinguished by cgh or mlva, possibly reflecting recent decent from a common ancestor. since ptxp <dig> was first detected relatively recently, in  <dig>  we presume that this allele was derived from ptxp <dig>  which predominated in the period  <dig> to  <dig>  as fim3- <dig> was not detected before  <dig>  it seems likely that a mutation in a ptxp3-fim3- <dig> strains resulted in the ptxp3-fim3- <dig> lineage, and this was indicated in fig.  <dig>  we cannot exclude the alternative hypothesis, however, that the ptxp <dig> allele arose twice, in a fim3- <dig> and fim3- <dig> background. an event which occurred before the branching off of ptxp <dig>  was the deletion of rd- <dig> and rd- <dig>  two regions which are absent from all the dutch strains analyzed from the period  <dig> to  <dig>  the absence of rd- <dig> was characteristic for the ptxp <dig> lineage suggesting that its deletion preceded the point mutation in ptxp <dig> or that it occurred early in the history of this lineage . it is also possible that the deletion conferred a strong selective advantage resulting in clonal expansion and replacement of ptxp <dig> strains still harboring rd- <dig>  an analysis of strains from different european countries by pcr also revealed that rd- <dig> was absent in ptxp <dig> strains. conversely, rd- <dig> was present in all european ptxp <dig> strains studied .

brinig et al.  <cit> , also analyzed dutch ptxp <dig> strains with cgh and did not observe deletion of rd- <dig> in these strains. this study did not include any dutch ptxp <dig> strains. strains in which rd- <dig> was deleted were found in australia, italy and the usa  <cit> . similarly, caro et al.  <cit>  and heikkinen et al.  <cit>  described the loss of rd- <dig> in b. pertussis isolates in french and finnish strains . in the latter paper the loss of rd- <dig> was found in all strains of a certain pfge profile  that is associated with nationwide epidemics. it would be interesting to determine if in other countries rd- <dig> loss is linked to ptxp <dig> as shown in our study.
