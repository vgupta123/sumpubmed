BACKGROUND
pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive common tumors, the five-year survival rate being less than 20% despite surgery and/or chemotherapy  <cit> . this very poor prognosis is mainly due to the propensity of this tumor to invade the adjacent structures and metastasize to distant organs early in the course of disease. despite intensive efforts to improve therapy for this advanced disease, treatment remains unsatisfactory and most patients die within months as a result of rapid local spread of the tumor or metastatic dissemination. the biological characteristics underlying the aggressive behavior of these tumors are incompletely understood.

integrins are dimeric proteins composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits and are divided into subgroups according to their preference for binding to extracellular matrix  proteins or cell surface molecules  <cit> . these adhesion molecules play principal roles in various aspects of tumor biology. increased expression of laminin binding integrins or decreased expression of fibronectin binding integrins has been correlated with aggressive growth and metastatic capacity of several tumors  <cit> . we previously reported that the enhancement of α6β1-integrin expression by interleukin -1α acting through il receptor type i  plays an important role in metastatic and invasive behaviors in pancreatic cancer, and proved that the strong expression of the α <dig> integrin subunit in pancreatic cancer tissue significantly correlated with the poor prognosis and the presence of hepatic metastases in patients with pancreatic cancer  <cit> .

the plasminogen activation cascade is one critical pathway frequently implicated in cancer cell growth, invasion, and spread  <cit> . overexpression of urokinase plasminogen activator  and upa receptor  have been reported in human cancer tissues, and a strong correlation has been associated between upa and upar expression levels and poor prognosis and upa is localized in primary pancreatic cancer specimens  <cit> .

the activation of ras and its downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway is one of the important roles of integrin ligation  <cit> . furthermore, overexpression of upar in cancer cells is maintained by constitutively activated erk1-dependent signaling cascade  <cit> . recently it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of the erk/mapk pathway suppresses the pancreatic cancer cell invasion in vitro  <cit>  and colonic tumor growth in vivo  <cit> . based on these reports, integrins in association with upar may activate the ras pathway to regulate proliferative and invasive behaviors of cancer cells.

the aims of this study were to identify the role of integrins and upa/upar for pancreatic cancer cell adhesive and invasive capabilities and to evaluate the correlation of upa and integrins expression with clinicopathological characteristics of pancreatic cancer patients. we demonstrated that upa/upar and α6β1-integrin play important roles in enhancement of adhesive and invasive capabilities of pancreatic cancer cells through ras/erk signaling pathway. furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that strong expression of upar and α <dig> integrin was found to be independent prognostic indicator of pancreatic cancer patients. our results suggest that il-1α induces discernibly aggressive capability in pancreatic cancer and that these regulations can be helpful to understand biological processes for better translational treatment for pancreatic cancer patients.

RESULTS
integrins, il-1ri, upa and upar expression and alteration in pancreatic cancer cells
we first analyzed three pancreatic cancer cell lines, bxpc- <dig>  capan- <dig>  and sw <dig>  for the presence of integrin subunits, il-1ri, upa, and upar. in immunoblotting analysis, all three cell lines have expression of α <dig>  α <dig>  and αv integrin subunits. all three cell lines lacked β <dig> integrin subunits expression, while high expression of β <dig> integrin subunit was observed. the high expression of il-1ri was observed in three cell lines. the expression of upa and upar was also observed in three cell lines .

in flow cytometric analysis, integrin surface expression was measured since the cells were fixed and not permeabilized prior to anti-integrin antibody incubation. the expression of α <dig> and αv integrin subunits remained unchanged in response to ril-1α after  <dig> h, while the expression of α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits was enhanced in all pancreatic cancer cells . in bxpc- <dig> cells, the expression of α <dig> integrin subunit was enhanced in response to il-α, while it remained unchanged in capan- <dig> and sw <dig> cell lines. the upar expression was also enhanced in response to ril-1α after  <dig> h in all three cell lines. enhancement of upar correlated with an increase in the cell surface expression of upa in pancreatic cancer cells .

il-1α, interleukin-1α; upa, urokinase plasminogen activator; upar, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. all data are expressed as mean ± s.d. the p-values indicate statistical significance between data in controls and presence of il-α. a p <  <dig> .

proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in response to il-1α
we determined the proliferative response of three pancreatic cancer cell lines in response to ril-1α for  <dig> h. pancreatic cancer cells stimulated by ril-1α showed  <dig> – <dig> -fold increase in proliferation compared to untreated conditions . inhibitory antibodies against α <dig> and β <dig> integrin inhibited the baseline and il-1α-induced proliferation of all three pancreatic cancer cell lines . no effect on proliferation was observed with control igg . these results indicate that α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits are involved in il-1α-induced and normal proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells.

adhesion of pancreatic cancer cells in response to il-1α
to determine whether il-1α have any effect on the adhesion of pancreatic cancer cells, we investigated the adhesive response of pancreatic cancer cell lines to laminin, the putative ligand of the α6β1-integrin, in response to ril-1α in pancreatic cancer cells. all three cell lines showed enhanced adhesion when stimulated by ril-1α for  <dig> h . il-1α-induced and basal adhesive response of these cell lines was suppressed by inhibitory antibodies against α <dig> and β <dig> integrin but not by control igg.

migration of pancreatic cancer cells in response to il-1α
the migration potential of pancreatic cancer cells stimulated with ril-1α for  <dig> h was examined by using matrigel-coated invasion chambers. all three pancreatic cancer cell lines showed significant enhancement of migration in the presence of il-1α. the migration of pancreatic cancer cells correlated with an increase in cell surface bound upa and upar . il-1α-induced migration of pancreatic cancer cells was inhibited by anti-α <dig> integrin, anti-β <dig> integrin, and anti-upar antibodies. especially, each antibody inhibits the basal migration of these three cell lines . control igg had no effect on the migration of pancreatic cancer cell lines. these data suggest that il-1α-induced enhancement of α <dig> and β <dig> integrin and upar may have a role in enhancing the migration of pancreatic cancer cells.

il-1α, interleukin-1α; upar, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. all data are expressed as mean ± s.d. . the p-values indicate statistical significance between data in controls and presence of il-α with/without respective antibodies. a p <  <dig> .

il-1α activates ras and downstream erk pathway in pancreatic cancer cells
to estimate whether il-1α can activate ras/erk pathway to regulate proliferation, adhesion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells, we investigated the effect of il-1α on this pathway. il-1α enhanced the activation of ras, as evidenced by the increased ras-gtp levels in pancreatic cancer cells. activation of ras correlated with the phosphorylation of erk. these results indicate that il-1α may induce activation of erk through a ras-dependent pathway . to evaluate whether α6β1-integrin and upar affect activation of ras and erk, pancreatic cancer cells were treated for  <dig> min with the inhibitory antibodies before being exposed to ril-1α for  <dig> min. inhibition of α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits and upar signaling pathway inhibited activation of basal/il-1α-induced ras and phosphorylation of erk . we performed the same examinations on all three cell lines. the results of three cell lines are very similar to the presented findings, therefore, we presented the data of sw <dig> cell line. these results suggest that α6β1-integrin and upar expression have an important role in regulating il-1α-induced activation of signaling pathways via il-1ri. detection of total erk 1/ <dig> levels served as a loading control.

immunohistochemical localization of α <dig> and β <dig> integrin and upar in ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas
the clinical features of  <dig> patients with invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were evaluated . the mean age of all patients was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years . none had received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. some patients received postoperative therapy; however, there was no difference in outcome among the various treatment modalities. the pt, pn, and pm categories were determined according to the tnm classification  <cit> . the m category was determined from the intraoperative findings, chest and bone radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, and laboratory tests reflecting bone, chest, and liver metastasis. ten patients had synchronous or heterochronous liver metastasis. the tissue specimens were obtained at pancreatoduodenectomy  and distal pancreatectomy .

upar, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; h, head of pancreas; b, body of pancreas; t, tail of pancreas; p, papillary adenocarcinoma; muc, mucinous carcinoma; w, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma; mod, moderatery-differentiated adenocarcinoma. the pt, pn, and pm categories were determined according to the tnm classification  <cit> . the ap-values were obtained using the mann-whiteny u test. values of age are given mean ± s.d. n.s., no significant.

immunohistochemical expression of α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits and upar was evaluated in invasive ductal adenocarcinomas  and duct cells in non-cancerous region of pancreas . in  <dig> cancerous regions, the α <dig> integrin subunit and upar were strongly to moderately expressed , whereas the α <dig> integrin subunit was not expressed or expressed weakly and upar was absent in non-cancerous region of the pancreas . weak-to-strong expression of the β <dig> integrin subunit was observed in both malignant and non-cancerous region, and there was no trend in β <dig> integrin subunit expression. a significant association was found between strong expression of α <dig> integrin subunit and upar in pancreatic cancer specimens . the α <dig> integrin subunit expression was significantly higher in malignant regions compared to non-cancerous regions of the pancreas .

upar, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. the ap-values indicate statistical significance between cancerous region and non-cancerous region.

there was a significant association between strong co-expression of α <dig> integrin subunit with upar and the presence of liver metastasis , lymph node metastasis , and retroperitoneal invasion of pancreatic cancer . no significant correlation was found between co-expression of α <dig> integrin subunit with upar and gender of patients, age, tnm stage, tumor location, cancer cell differentiation, intrapancreatic nerve invasion, lymphatic system invasion, and venous system invasion . we also carried out a multivariate analysis of survival using the cox's proportional hazards regression model, including each of the pathological parameters and strong expression of α <dig> integrin subunit and upar . the strong expression of α <dig> integrin subunit  and upar  can be independent prognostic factors.

statistical significance was indicated by ap <  <dig> .

at the time of analysis, the median follow-up time for patients was  <dig>  months  after surgery. twenty-six patients died of pancreatic cancer, and three patients died of other diseases. there was a statistically significant association between cases with and without strong expression of α <dig> integrin in poor prognosis of patients with invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas . in addition, a statistically significant association was also detected between cases with and without strong upar expression .

discussion
in this study, we demonstrate that il-1α-induced proliferation, adhesion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells correlated with activation of ras and downstream erk pathway. inhibition of α <dig>  β <dig> integrin, or upar signaling pathway inhibited il-1α-induced activation of ras/erk pathway with subsequent inhibition in proliferation, adhesion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. these observations suggest that α6β1-integrin and upar play a significant role in il-1α-regulated functions of pancreatic cancer cells.

enhancement of α <dig> integrin expression has been reported previously for cells undergoing malignant transformation such as fibroblasts  <cit> , squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> , hepatocytes  <cit> , mouse epidermal keratinocytes  <cit> , malignant melanoma  <cit> , prostate cancer  <cit> , and pancreatic cancer  <cit> . we previously reported that the expression of only two subunits, the α <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits, by the high-metastatic cancer cell lines was enhanced by il-1α, and the adhesive and invasive capability was also enhanced by il-α <cit> . in this study, we have determined the enhancement of α6β1-integrin expression by il-1α and the subsequent increased migration of pancreatic cancer cell lines which express il-1ri protein to matrigel, which contains several ecm proteins. the α <dig> integrin subunit is a major laminin receptor for adhesion in laminin-rich basement membranes. in regard to the expression of α <dig> integrin which binds to collagen type i, fibronectin, and laminin with low specificity, we could not detect any changes in capan- <dig> and sw <dig> cell lines, whereas its expression was significantly enhanced in bxpc- <dig> cell lines. the enhancement of α <dig> and αv integrins expression was not observed in response to il-1α in this study. although the relative contributions of these adhesion molecules alterations appear to vary depending on the cell line and the stimulus used, in this study we can suggest that the α <dig> integrin subunit which has a strong adhesion affinity to laminin is one of the most important biological molecules for cancer cell adhesion and migration.

the strong expression of α <dig> integrin was observed in 48% of cancerous regions of the pancreas, while the α <dig> integrin subunit was weakly expressed in non-cancerous regions . interestingly, in non-cancerous regions of pancreatic tissues, α <dig> integrin subunit was not or only weakly expressed. the α <dig> integrin subunit is an integral part of hemidesmosomes. it is possible that the detachment of cancer cells from the pancreatic tissues and resultant metastasis formation in the target organs may be easier where α <dig> integrin subunit expression in non-cancerous regions of pancreatic tissues is weak or not observed. and the enhanced expression of the α <dig> integrin subunit via il- <dig> signaling transmitted through il-1ri may results in increased invasive and metastatic capabilities of cancer cells in cancerous tissues. in addition, the induction of microenvironment induced expression of adhesion and metastasis-related molecules may serve to regulate the process of pancreatic cancer proliferation, adhesion and invasion.

in this study, no expression of β <dig> integrin subunit was observed in three pancreatic cancer cell lines studied. the lack of β <dig> integrin subunit is consistent with the reported for prostate cancer. the progression of the cancer from intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive prostate carcinoma results in loss of β <dig> integrin expression and is replaced by alternative α6β1-integrin functions  <cit> . concerning the β integrin subunit, pancreatic cancer cells that express β <dig> integrin with naturally acquired high constitutive activity were able to maintain the necessary balance of adhesion and release by means of coordinated activation and inactivation of integrin affinity  <cit> .

in this study, we have focused in identifying some of the molecules that are regulated by il-1α with a view to gain better understanding of the il-1α induced molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the progression and dissemination of pancreatic cancer. we previously reported that blocking il-1ri with neutralizing antibody inhibited the adhesion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. we also proved that il-1α had no demonstrable effect on pancreatic cancer cell lines without expressing il-1ri  <cit> . we herein demonstrated that the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells was enhanced by exposing to il-1α. il-1α also enhanced the adhesion and migration of pancreatic cancer cell lines expressing the il-1ri, and these enhancements correlated with the enhancement of α6β1-integrin and upa/upar expression. based on our results, enhancement of α6β1-integrin and upa/upar expression in pancreatic cancer cells occurs in the presence of il-1ri.

the concomitant overexpression of upa and upar was found to be associated with shorter survival in pancreatic cancer patients  <cit> . on the other hand, harvey et al. reported that there were not any correlation with the co-expression of upa and upar  <cit> . in our immunohistochemical analysis, upar was strongly expressed in  <dig> % of cancerous regions of pancreatic cancer, whilst the expression of upar was absent in non-cancerous region of the pancreas. a significant association was demonstrated between strong expression of α <dig> integrin subunit and upar in pancreatic cancer specimens. the strong co-expression of α <dig> integrin subunit with upar supports our results in vitro and suggests that α6β1-integrin and upar play a significant role in aggressive functions of pancreatic cancer cells. in this study, we demonstrated a significant correlation between co-expression of α <dig> integrin subunit with upar and the presence of liver metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and the retroperitoneal invasion in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. we also found that the strong expression of α <dig> integrin subunit and upar correlated with the patient's poor prognosis. furthermore, multivariate analysis demonstrated that the strong expression of α <dig> integrin subunit and upar can be independent prognostic indicators in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. these observations suggest that the diagnostic evaluation of α <dig> integrin subunit and upar expression might provide valuable prognostic information to aid treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer patients.

recent reports demonstrated that integrins directly associate with upar to mediate cellular function  <cit> . upar has been reported to associate with many signaling molecules and to mediate signal transduction  <cit> . the α <dig> integrin/upar interaction has been demonstrated in human ovarian cancer cell  <cit>  and prostate cancer cell lines  <cit> , and these data suggest that signaling through α <dig> integrin and upar may be essential for ensuring cancer phenotype expression. recently, ahmed et al. reported the loss of upa/upar-mediated erk activation with downregulation of upar expression in colon cancer cells  <cit> . they also reported that the upregulation of α <dig> integrin and upa/upar correlated with the activation of ras and its downstream erk pathway in ovarian cancer cells  <cit> . upa/upar interaction with β <dig> integrin has been shown to activate erk pathway  <cit>  and disruption oft his interaction can result in loss of adhesion and tumor progression in nude mice  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that integrin-ecm interactions activate erk 1/ <dig> signaling cascades  <cit> . we demonstrated that il-1α stimulation and cancer cell adhesion to collagen type iv enhanced the focal adhesion kinase  protein association with β <dig> integrin and fak phosphorylation. and these enhancements correlated with the activation of ras/erk signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer cells  <cit> . the integrin-upar interaction is very important as many integrin receptors activate intracellular signal pathways to fully activate cell survival and proliferation pathways  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, upregulation of α <dig> integrin subunit and upa/upar correlated with the activation of ras and downstream erk pathways. il-1α-induced activation of ras and downstream erk pathway can be inhibited by using inhibitory antibodies against α <dig> and β <dig> integrin and upar, consistent with the inhibition of proliferation, adhesion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a significant association between strong co-expression of α <dig> integrin and upar in pancreatic cancerous regions, and the strong expression of α <dig> integrin and upar was found to be independent prognostic indicators in pancreatic cancer patients. based on these results, il-1α induces discernibly aggressive capability in pancreatic cancer and these regulations can be helpful to understand biological processes of pancreatic cancer.
