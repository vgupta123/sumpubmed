BACKGROUND
canine transmissible venereal tumor  is a unique tumor that is transmitted by viable tumor cells  <cit>  through injured mucosa and skin. ctvt cells have a stabilized genome with almost identical dog leukocyte antigen class ii loci, which may have originated in wolves  <cit> . the tumor cells effectively evade the host’s histocompatibility  barrier for long periods, and transplanted cells grow liberally in the progression  phase for a few months or over  <dig> year  <cit> . this immunoevasion was found partly because of the high concentration of tumor-secreted transforming growth factor-β , which inhibits tumoral mhc antigen expression and the activity of natural killer cells  <cit> . however, the immune systems of most hosts eventually reject the transplanted cells in the regression  phase  <cit> . one mechanism for this rejection is related to interleukin - <dig> produced by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes  that counteract the activities of tgf-β  <cit> . ctvt is one of the few tumors that allow us to study detailed dynamic changes in host–cancer interactions during spontaneous regression of a tumor.

chemokines are classified as a group of 8– <dig> kda proteins with structural similarity and chemotactic activity  <cit> . chemokines are generated by leukocytes and several types of stromal cells and are chemoattractants for a wide range of leukocytes. chemokines play an important role in lymphocyte migration, recirculation, modulation of immune response, and leukocyte recruitment to the inflammation sites. there are in the main two subfamilies of chemokines, which are defined based on the arrangement of the first two cysteines, which can be either adjacent  or separated by one other amino acid . cxc chemokines act on neutrophils, and maintain the amino-terminal sequence glu-leu-arg  motif, which is necessary for receptor recognition and signaling  <cit> . one of the elr+cxc chemokines, chemokine  ligand  <dig> , has been shown to activate neutrophils for chemotaxis over a wide range of stimulus concentrations  <cit> , for the degranulation of lysosomal enzymes  <cit>  and to increase adhesion molecules on these cells  <cit> . activated cxcl <dig> induces the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of inflammation or injury. increased cxcl <dig> levels were detected in epithelial cells isolated from clinical patients with active ulcerative colitis, which suggests that cxcl <dig> contributes to the sustained neutrophil presence in these patients. however, unlike other elr+cxc chemokines  <cit> , the relationship between cxcl <dig> and cancer has not been well investigated.

in the tumor microenvironment, chemokines and their receptors play pivotal roles in regulating angiogenesis, cell migration and tumor growth and help to clarify the progression of the cancer  <cit> . some particular chemokine–receptor pairs are included in tumor metastasis by their chemoattractants function in cell migration. in addition, chemokines make the tumor microenvironment more suitable for tumor growth by induction of leucocytes migration and activation of inflammatory responses  <cit> . recently accumulated evidence shows that chemokine receptor signaling also contributes to tumor survival and proliferation, mainly due to their migratory promotion activities  <cit> . many studies have shown that cxc chemokines are co-expressed in a variety of tumors  <cit>  and account for the higher aggressiveness of tumors  <cit> .

our previous study showed that canine dendritic cells  derived from peripheral blood express cxcl <dig> mrna and secrete cxcl <dig> protein in response to chronic inflammation inducing cytokines, such as il-1β, il- <dig>  tgf-β and tumor necrosis factor -α, but not to acute inflammation-associated cytokines, such as interferon -γ and lipopolysaccharides   <cit> . these findings suggest that dc produce cxcl <dig> in a chronic inflammation site under an immune tolerance situation. we also demonstrated that only an immunologically-favorable microenvironment can fully support the maturation of dc  <cit> , and ctvt have the ability to induce an immune escape microenvironment  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that the tumor microenvironment of ctvt may involve cxcl <dig> expression and allow cxcl <dig> to achieve chronic inflammation and tumor progression.

the relationship between cxcl <dig> and ctvt is investigated in this study. it was found that cxcl <dig> overexpression was associated with the progression phase of ctvt, while during the regression phase, the tumor cells express a very low level of cxcl <dig>  in addition, we also revealed that til-derived il- <dig> down-regulated cxcl <dig> expression in ctvt. these results suggest a novel role of cxcl <dig> in cancer progression.

RESULTS
association between cxcl <dig> overexpression and tumor growth pattern
the mrna levels of cxcl <dig> in the tumor masses from the p and r phase were determined by real-time rt-pcr. as shown in figure 1a, the cxcl <dig> mrna expression was significantly higher in the p phase than in the r phase . western blotting revealed that in comparison with the r phase, the cxcl <dig> protein was significantly up-regulated in the ctvt p phase . the specific bands were normalized with the internal control β-actin. these data show that cxcl <dig> increased concordantly with ctvt progressive growth both in terms of the mrna and protein expression levels.

r-phase til inhibited the expression of cxcl <dig> in p phase ctvt cells
to find the factor that regulated the expression of cxcl <dig>  we cocultured p-phase ctvt cells with r-phase til using a transwell system. the p-phase ctvt cells were separated from r-phase til using the  <dig>  μm pore size of the transwell system. after  <dig> h coculture, the cxcl <dig> expression was significantly decreased . the inhibitory effect could be achieved even in 1: <dig> ratio of til: ctvt cells. this result suggested that til might secrete some soluble substances to inhibit the production of cxcl <dig> 

the expression of cxcl <dig> was regulated by il- <dig> in ctvt cells
as the il- <dig> produced by r-phase til counteracts the activities of tgf-β to induce ctvt regression  <cit> , we further confirmed that the expression of cxcl <dig> was regulated by il- <dig>  the responses of the expression of cxcl <dig> and its receptor, cxcr <dig>  to different doses of il- <dig> were studied. the expression pattern of cxcl <dig>  coincided with that of cxcr <dig> . cxcl <dig> and cxcr <dig> were down-regulated with high-dose il- <dig> treatment in a dose response fashion. however, when the concentration of il- <dig> was low, such as  <dig> ng/ml, the cxcl <dig> production was higher than that in tumor cells without any il- <dig> treatment .

regulation of cxcl <dig> expression in ctvt cells
to further investigate the expression of cxcl <dig> in ctvt, we aimed to examine endogenous signals that up- or down-regulate cxcl <dig> expression. il-1β is a common cytokine that stimulates cxcl <dig> expression  <cit> . in our previous study, we found that tgf-β was elevated in the ctvt p phase and decreased in the r phase, and tgf-β activities were regulated by il- <dig> released from til  <cit> . based on these observations, we used il-1β and tgf-β to verify the up-regulation of cxcl <dig> and used il- <dig> to investigate the inhibition of cxcl <dig> expression in ctvt cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  il-1β and tgf-β did not increase the cxcl <dig> expression in comparison with ctvt cells alone while il- <dig> significantly down-regulated the expression of cxcl <dig> in tumor cells. in addition, the inhibition effect of il- <dig> was not influenced by the combination of il-1β and tgf-β. the il-6-mediated cxcl <dig> decrease could be further demonstrated since blocking il- <dig> activity in tils significantly reversed this reduction . together, these results indicated that the down-regulation of cxcl <dig> in the r phase may due to the il- <dig> produced by til.

discussion
the importance of cxcl <dig> in regulating tumorogenesis in colon cancer has been reported  <cit> . our current observations provide further insight into the potential importance of cxcl <dig> signaling in promoting tumor growth and progression. several studies have suggested that high expression of elr+cxc chemokines in vivo and in vitro is associated with a poor prognosis  <cit> . these studies pointed out that high levels of elr+cxc chemokines, including cxcl <dig>  are associated with enhanced tumor growth  <cit> . high levels of cxc chemokines are associated with risk of recurrence after tumor resection  <cit> . one report indicated that increasing numbers of tumor infiltrating neutrophils in advanced cancer are associated with reduced mortality  <cit> . neutrophils can either exclude tumor cell populations or provide for their invasive potential  <cit> . neutrophil recruitment by elr+cxc chemokines help tumor cells to metastasize to lymph nodes  <cit> . furthermore, elr+cxc also have the ability to stimulate tumor cell proliferation  <cit> . cxcl <dig> overexpression in p-phase ctvt confirmed this observation.

in this study, we found that til-derived il- <dig> played a key role in the modulation of cxcl <dig> expression in ctvt. the presence of soluble il-6r in combination with il- <dig> affects the recruitment of leukocyte subpopulations through the concurrent ability of the active complex to suppress elr+cxc chemokine expression induced by proinflammatory cytokines   <cit> . il- <dig> is a pleiotropic cytokine that is produced by many kinds of cells. depending on the target, il- <dig> can suppress growth, elicit growth, or influence differentiation  <cit> . il- <dig> can directly elevate the functions of nk cells including proliferation, cytotoxicity, and the expression of surface activation antigen and adhesion molecules  <cit> . il- <dig> and its soluble receptor  are important in the regulation of leukocyte recruitment  <cit> . our data were consistent with these observations. il- <dig> could suppress the expression of cxcl <dig> in ctvt cells. furthermore, although ctvt-derived tgf-β plays a role in damaging the host immune system during the p phase, til-derived il- <dig> is responsible for the recovery of immune cells activity during the r phase  <cit> . although il- <dig> is present in the til supernatants of both the p and r phases, its concentration is significantly higher in the r-phase til supernatant  <cit> . this may indicate il- <dig> inhibits cxcl <dig> expression is one of the mechanism responsible for activating host immune system to against tumor. however, the low concentration of il- <dig> produced in the p phase may act as an inducer for cxcl <dig> expression.

many reasons for the induction of chemokine/receptor expression have been identified. chemokine receptor expression is regulated both at the transcriptional level and post-transcriptionally via rna stability, translation and receptor desensitization and internalization  <cit> . the tumor microenvironment, and mutant proteins or changed signaling in the tumor cell itself, can also influence the chemokine receptor levels. conditions present within cancer, such as hypoxia or a rich cytokine environment, can induce the transcription of chemokine receptors  <cit> . the increased expression of cxcr <dig> in ctvt cells may potentially activate cxcl <dig> signaling in an autocrine/paracrine pattern, the result of which appears to enhance ctvt cell survival and growth in the host.

in the p phase, il-1β and tgf-β were expressed at a high level  <cit> . tumor-derived tgf-β causes serious immune-inhibition in dogs with ctvt  <cit> . this encourages us to further investigate the relationship between tgf-β and cxcl <dig>  however, neither il-1β nor tgf-β could induce greater cxcl <dig> expression in p-phase ctvt cells . this may be the reason for which freshly isolated ctvt cells alone could express very high levels of cxcl <dig>  so ctvt cells treated with il-1β or tgf-β failed to express cxcl <dig> at a higher level than ctvt cells alone. another possibility is that tgf-β could not induce cxcl <dig> expression in ctvt cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, overexpression of cxcl <dig> was found to be associated with advanced tumor stage. il- <dig> played a modulation role in the expression of cxcl <dig> in ctvt. through multiple mechanisms, cxcl <dig> may be involved in the migration and invasion of cancer cells and in tumor progression. these host–cancer interactions and the mechanisms behind them deserve further study. another valuable endeavor is research into the mechanisms by which hosts develop efficient ways to defend themselves against tumors that grow over months. further studies are needed to confirm and understand this interesting observation and to determine whether cxcl <dig> may serve as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
