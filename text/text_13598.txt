BACKGROUND
rna microarrays have had a major impact on both experimental and computational biology. they have played a role in predicting molecular targets and bioactive compound modes-of-action  <cit> , they have helped identify genes responsible for disease- and environmental-induced phenotypes  <cit> . at the same time, statistical methods for interpreting genome-wide microarray data have progressed over the past decade. drug target identification methods have gone from labor-intensive techniques, like chemogenomic fitness or haploinsufficiency profiling  <cit> , to more efficient, statistically driven models such as those based on network-filtering  <cit>  and network topology association  <cit> . 

supervised learning methods like support vector machines have also been widely used to develop statistical methods that predict drug-protein interactions  <cit> . these methods employ training networks, constructed from protein-ligand binding data, known protein sequences, compound similarity scores, and in the case of campillos et al., known drug side effects. similar to our method, these training networks capture interaction “patterns” between two molecules  to predict known and new drug targets. although unlike our method, these patterns are typically taken as known input, whereas in ssem-lasso, they are learned from the microarray data.

accurate interpretation of transcriptional changes resulting from genome-wide microarray data can be influenced by different variables, including those manifested by the experimental biologist and the computational biologist. these variables are especially critical for drug treatment studies, because drugs tend to produce multi-gene and/or off-target perturbations  <cit> . for example experimental variables, such as rna quality, microarray preparation, nutrients, genetic background, and duration and strength of drug treatment can all play a role in the final gene target analysis  <cit> . similarly, information incorporated into any training, or learning, phase that is used to infer a gene interaction network or similar model structure, can impact results at the gene level. the potential effects of both biological and computational conditions – separately, or on their own – are widely acknowledged. nevertheless, it appears there is little work explicitly examining how these two types of conditions interact with each other to produce accurate and reliable molecular target predictions.

ssem-lasso uses a network-based approach consisting of two phases, training and testing. in the training phase, the method learns a collection of gene-gene interaction effects from compendium of microarray experiments , which are captured in an interaction network . then, in the testing phase, the method identifies genes experiencing an additive shift in their mean transcript levels in response to an external perturbation , after adjusting for the inferred gene-gene interactions . transcript residuals resulting from this step are ranked by their absolute values for all annotated genes in the compendium . genes with low ranks  are genes ssem-lasso distinguishes as standing out from the background gene regulatory effects. they are flagged as potential targets of the external perturbation of interest. as a result, ssem-lasso has the ability to significantly narrow the gene target window in comparison to rna change z-score computations .

ssem-lasso is unlike standard machine learning methods in that it is based on an explicit model of how perturbations propagate through a network of gene regulatory effects, in the form of a system of sparse simultaneous equations   <cit> . other machine learning approaches typically have been based on models defined through relationships learned between known drug-target interactions and various biological inputs  <cit> . ssem-lasso also differs from machine learning in the data being analyzed and the interaction pairs being identified. ssem-lasso uses microarray gene expression data from hundreds of experiments carried out under varying experimental conditions. the machine learning methods discussed above use for example, protein-ligand interaction and compound 2-d similarity data listed in conventional databases like kegg  <cit> , brenda  <cit> , and simcomp  <cit> .

ssem-lasso’s mathematical properties have been fully characterized  <cit> . the method has achieved improved sensitivity and accuracy over the rna z-test method  and a competitive, alternative network-inference method, mni  <cit> . furthermore, the two phases of ssem-lasso allow for modifications of both experimental variables  and computational variables  to optimize drug target predictions.

ssem-lasso is applicable to a range of perturbation experiments. the method does not impose explicit constraints on the experimental conditions, such as particular deletion strain, inducible expression system, or time-course conditions, for inferring gene network interactions. ssem-lasso has been shown to perform well in the context of in silico experiments. furthermore, it has proven successful at predicting gene targets of s. cerevisiae haploid and diploid deletion strains. however, the method requires further optimization for predicting drug gene targets . this is an anticipated caveat due to the biologically complex nature of a chemical perturbation. given this combination of features, we determine ssem-lasso ideal for our goal of investigating experimental-computational dynamics, and at the same time, we seek to improve its performance with drug gene target predictions.

we use the model organism, s. cerevisiae, and a compound with a known mechanism of action, fluconazole , to explore how choice of variables in testing and training phases influences the quality of final gene target predictions. fl specifically binds and inhibits cytochrome p <dig> -dependent lanosterol c-14-α demethylase   <cit> , an essential hemoprotein in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway . ergosterol is the principle component of yeast cell membranes, similar to cholesterol in animal cells. fl inhibition of erg11p causes the accumulation of toxic 14-α-methylated sterols and ergosterol depletion  <cit> . this results in increased cell membrane permeability and asymmetry and irregular sphingolipid, phospholipid and long-chain fatty acid synthesis  <cit> . additionally, erg11p is dependent on oxygen and heme production, and erg <dig> deletion strains are nonviable under aerobic growth conditions. therefore, erg11p disruption by fl can also lead to defects in heme biosynthesis and mitochondrial respiration  <cit> .

in addition to erg <dig>  erg <dig>  upc <dig> and hap <dig> are impacted by sterol and heme depletion. erg <dig> encodes for Δ-sterol c-methyltransferase, an enzyme that functions downstream of erg11p in ergosterol biosynthesis and is responsible for the transmethylation of zymosterol to fecosterol  <cit>  . although erg6p is not the direct gene target of fl, nor is it essential for cell growth, erg6p regulates appropriate sterol and fatty acid composition and distribution, and is therefore required for normal cell membrane permeability and rigidity  <cit> .

sterol regulatory element binding protein, upc2p, is a member of the zn2-cys <dig> transcription factor family required for exogenous sterol uptake during anaerobic growth. upc2p, with ecm22p, regulates the transcription of late stage ergosterol biosynthesis genes in response to azole-induced sterol depletion  <cit>  . its dna binding sequence is conserved between c. albicans and s. cerevisiae and is in a region of the erg <dig> promoter critical for azole induction of erg <dig> expression  <cit> .

heme-activator protein, hap1p, is a transcription factor that controls the expression of aerobic and anaerobic genes through both its interactions with heme and transcriptional control of heme-dependent repressor of hypoxic genes,  <cit> . hap1p binds the promoters of erg <dig> and erg <dig> under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions, however it is most active in repressing these genes’ expressions under hypoxic conditions  <cit>  . erg <dig> expression through induction of rox <dig> is also regulated by hap1p. additionally, hap1p controls upc2p expression to maintain basal expression levels of erg genes. however upon sterol depletion, upc2p no longer requires hap1p to transcribe erg genes  <cit> . these genes – erg <dig>  upc <dig>  and hap <dig> – are therefore interconnected and exemplary targets to further investigate fl-induced expression changes.

the expression of the cyp <dig> c- <dig> sterol desaturase, erg <dig>  is indirectly investigated in this study through the haploid heme deletion strain, hem1Δ. the hem1Δ strain cannot synthesize δ-aminolevulinic acid, a precursor in heme synthesis. in the absence of heme, hap1p binds the erg <dig> promoter to suppress expression of erg <dig>  therefore hem1Δ mutants contain little to no erg5p mrnas  <cit> . additionally, erg5p can be directly bound and inhibited by azoles, like fl   <cit> . thus, erg <dig> is considered the primary target of the hem1Δ strain and an additional fl-targeted gene in this study.

this study contributes to the larger goal of improving microarrays for therapeutic discovery and development. using a model organism and an established drug with known target genes and pathways, we are able to identify conditions that both the experimentalist and computational biologists can fine-tune to more accurately predict drug effects at the gene expression level. herein we present a step-wise strategy through ssem-lasso that scientists can take to optimize drug gene target predictions at the genome-wide level.

RESULTS
testing phase  variations for predicting fl gene targets
the overall goal of the testing phase was to determine if changes in experimental variables, or “input”, altered ssem-lasso ranks, or “output”, of drug gene targets . we assessed how well ssem-lasso identified a target gene relative to off -target, or orthogonal, genes over changing experimental conditions. this was evaluated by comparing the rank of the target gene relative to the rank of off-target genes.

studies have shown that desired physiological responses can be achieved by controlling the duration a drug is in contact with the host organism and the concentration of drug administered. this in turn can lead to more effective treatment strategies  <cit> . in the testing phase we regulated these critical treatment variables, exposure time and concentration, while maintaining constant the training compendium used to infer the gene network interactions. figure  <dig> outlines the experimental workflow. wild-type s. cerevisiae cells were treated with fl and harvested at either varying exposure times  or concentrations in aerobic, batch culture conditions . affymetrix microarray experiments were carried out in duplicate, and transcript signals were rma-normalized and processed with ssem-lasso . for all testing phase variations, the original training compendium from cosgrove et al. was used to infer the gene interaction network.

two analyses of ssem-lasso output – gene set and single gene – were conducted. for the gene set analysis, genes representative of  <dig> different biological pathways were grouped to form  <dig> target and  <dig> orthogonal gene sets. the target gene set unique to fl action, called “fl-interacters”, was comprised of genes affected by fl and/or associated with erg <dig>  fl-interacters included genes from ergosterol, terpenoid backbone, fatty acid and sphingolipid biosynthesis pathways, and sterol transport, heme and oxygen sensing pathways . the five orthogonal gene sets included genes from: dna replication and repair, pyrimidine biosynthesis and metabolism, rna transport, glycolysis and pentose phosphate and mitosis .

gene set analysis was carried out as follows: each gene within a gene set was detected across an increasing gene rank threshold, resulting in a receiver operating characteristic, or roc, curve for an fl treatment experiment. roc curves are graphical plots of the true positive rate against the false positive rate as the discrimination threshold is varied. areas under roc curves were converted into percentages  and compared across fl treatments . steeper roc curves result in larger auc percentages. the expected auc from random guessing is  <dig> , or 50%. auc values falling below  <dig>  denoted a higher false positive rate than random guessing, while auc values above  <dig>  denoted more true positives than what were expected with random guessing. we considered treatment experiments with aucs > <dig>  to experience stronger biological pathway effects than experiments with auc%s ≤ <dig> .

for single gene analysis, fl perturbation of its primary target, erg <dig>  was tracked along with fl targets associated with ergosterol biosynthesis, sterol transcription initiation and heme and oxygen transcriptional regulation, erg <dig>  upc <dig> and hap <dig>  respectively . ranks for orthogonal genes essential to cellular survival, mps <dig>  ade <dig>  top <dig>  cdc <dig>  pab <dig> and uba <dig>  were also monitored as indicators of fl off-target effects. lower ranks suggested more accurate prediction of fl action on an individual gene . rank percentiles were also computed to assess how well a gene ranked relative to the background set of all genes.

training phase  variations for improving fl single gene target predictions
in addition to the testing phase strategy, modifications to the gene interaction network in the training phase were conducted. the overall goal of the training phase was to determine if changes to the network increased or decreased ranks of gene targets.

variations to the training phase involved the addition of biologically-motivated microarray expression data into the original training compendium from cosgrove et al. subsequent modifications to gene-gene interaction “patterns” propagated through the network resulted in changes of varying degrees in ssem-lasso rank predictions . two measurements, rank change  and rc percentile, reflected how strongly network variations affected ssem-lasso predictions. if rc of a target gene was positive, prediction of the gene perturbation was said to “improve”. rc of a target gene was compared against all gene rcs within an experiment by calculating a percentile of rc, or the percentage of genes with a rc as high or higher than the target gene. the rc percentile provide a quantitative assessment of rc. thus, a tuneable network inference variable was established in the training phase.

testing phase: exposure time variations have stronger effects on fl gene set than on fl single gene targets
the first experimental condition manipulated in the testing phase was fl exposure time . the length of fl treatment in a population of unsynchronized cells was varied between one and four ets, at constant fl concentration . for each et experiment, results from both gene set  and single gene  were reported.

gene set analysis for fl-interacting genes resulted in individual auc%s for each et experiment, which were plotted for each of the  <dig> gene sets as shown in figure  <dig>  longer fl ets correlated with higher auc%s. from one to two ets, auc% increased noticeably from  <dig> to 55%, and at four ets auc% was at its highest of 60% . these results indicated that incubation of cells with fl for four ets was the optimal time point for ssem-lasso to predict fl effects on multiple, target genes.

auc%s for the orthogonal gene sets were also plotted, and similar improvement trends were observed for mitosis and glycolysis/pentose phosphate gene sets . ssem-lasso likely identified similar trends for these pathways, because they are also influenced by fl treatment. severe ergosterol depletion interferes with sparking functions of ergosterol  <cit> . hence, genes involved in mitosis that are critical to late stages of the cell cycle may have been dysregulated upon fl treatment. additionally, fl interrupts heme function, and thus the cell population may have adapted to increased hypoxic conditions by shifting from glucose metabolism via respiration to anaerobic fermentation  <cit> , thus affecting genes involved in glycolysis/pentose phosphate. yet, the other orthogonal pathways, rna transport, pyrimidine biosynthesis/metabolism, and dna replication/repair, did not reproduce the same improvement trend nor exhibit auc% values >50% . overall, the average auc%s for each of the  <dig> orthogonal gene sets were lower than those for fl-interacter gene set, demonstrating that fl exerted its strongest effects on the fl-targeted gene set .

single gene targets also were tracked across ets. erg <dig> ranked consistently lower than the collective population of orthogonal genes , suggesting ssem-lasso’s predictions were more specific for fl action on its therapeutic target.

interestingly, changing et  did not improve the algorithm’s predictions, and erg <dig> rank remained constant, between  <dig> and  <dig> , or in the 70th percentile of ranks . this was unlike the fl-interacter gene set results, which demonstrated a distinct trend with increasing et .erg <dig> was the only fl target that followed a distinct trend, in which erg <dig> rank decreased at higher et. at three and four ets, erg <dig> ranked in the 78th and 87th percentiles respectively, which were lower than erg <dig> ranks . ranks for upc <dig> and hap <dig> were consistently lower than both erg <dig> and erg <dig>  upc <dig> and hap <dig> ranked in the 93rd to  <dig> th percentiles for two, three, and four ets. similar to erg <dig>  upc <dig> and hap <dig> ranks did not vary with changes to et. .

ranks for each fl gene target were reported for each et. ranks are the average of two replicate experiments. rank percentile was computed as the percentage of genes with a rank as high or higher than the target gene. rank percentiles ≥ <dig> indicated significant perturbation of a gene as identified by ssem-lasso.

testing phase: concentration changes have minimal to modest effects on fl gene target predictions
the second testing phase variable optimized was fl concentration. s. cerevisiae cells require ergosterol for normal aerobic growth  <cit> , so it was necessary to determine a treatment concentration at which wild-type cells continued dividing with impaired ergosterol synthesis. fl dose-response curves and growth inhibitory values  were generated from in-house cell growth inhibition assays. fl dosing strategy was based on concentrations below the gi <dig> value – gi <dig> , gi <dig>  gi <dig>  gi <dig>  gi <dig> and gi <dig> – so that fl would not inhibit growth of more than 50% the cell population. thus, gene perturbations were not considered direct results of cell death signalling pathways, but steady-state expression changes specific to fl. ssem-lasso results were evaluated within the same gene set and single gene analysis frameworks as the et experiments.

similar to the fl gene set trend for et, higher fl treatment concentrations improved auc% values. fl effects were obvious upon treatment, jumping from 51% for control to 64% for gi <dig>  . auc%s continued to improve as fl concentrations increased, up to gi <dig>  these results demonstrated that ssem-lasso predicted fl action more accurately at treatment concentrations between gi <dig> and gi <dig>  with auc%s reaching 67-69% . orthogonal gene sets failed to show a similar trend as the fl-interacter gene set nor did they experience enhanced perturbation upon fl treatment. average auc% values remained below the fl-interacter gene set average of 64% across all fl concentrations . this was a positive indication that fl was specifically targeting genes associated with its activity.

in general, fl single gene ranks were insensitive to changes in fl concentrations, just as they did not fluctuate significantly with changing ets. at the onset of fl treatment, erg <dig> rank dropped from  <dig> to  <dig>  a clear response to fl treatment. however over increasing treatment concentrations, erg <dig> ranks hovered modestly between 1800- <dig>  with no noteworthy fluctuations . average ranks of the six orthogonal genes were predicted with ssem-lasso and proved unperturbed by fl. in addition, the orthogonal genes failed to experience the pronounced rank increase erg <dig> had at the onset of fl treatment , suggesting ssem-lasso was accurately predicting fl effects on its target.

erg <dig> followed a very similar concentration trend but with overall lower ranks than erg <dig> . transcription factors, upc <dig> and hap <dig>  had overall ranks below  <dig>  or in 98th to 99th percentile . however, a pronounced trend over increasing concentrations was not observed . these results were consistent with the et results, wherein the fl-targeted transcription factors performed significantly better than the metabolic targets, erg <dig> and erg <dig>  and also were not as strongly affected by et and concentration changes as erg <dig> and erg <dig> 

training phase: input of microarray expression data and modification of the gene interaction network influences fl single gene target predictions
after exploring how experimental testing conditions influenced predictions of drug target predictions, focus shifted to the computational details of ssem-lasso’s training phase. specifically, we generated modified training compendiums, or unique training phase variables, and examined how they altered the network’s gene-gene interaction “patterns” to improve final gene ranks. previous ssem-lasso studies demonstrated that removal of experiments in the same project group from the training compendium boosted ssem-lasso performance, perhaps due to the reduction of artifactual effects caused by lab-specific experimental variables  <cit> . here, we were interested in how the addition of microarray experiments related to the applied perturbation, fl treatment, affected predictions of fl gene targets.

taking advantage of the saccharomyces genome deletion collection  <cit> , microarray expression data was obtained for three deletion strains related to fl mechanism of action, erg11Δ/erg <dig>  erg6Δ, hem1Δ <cit> , and one not linked to fl action, spt3Δ <cit> . expression data from the fl drug treatment that yielded the best predictions of erg <dig> perturbation  was also included in training phase variations. first, we confirmed ssem-lasso identified the direct gene target for each deletion strain. in agreement with previous studies, ssem-lasso predicted all genetic deletion targets accurately . we proceeded to individually add each experiment’s expression data into the original training compendium to generate five new training compendiums. modified gene interaction networks were then inferred for each modified training compendium . changes in gene rank  between the original and modified training compendiums for fl targets, erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  and non-target spt <dig>  were subsequently determined.

ssem-lasso gene ranks were determined for gene targets of genetic deletions and compound treatments. all microarray experiments were performed using affymetrix yeast genome  <dig> gene chips, and data was rma-normalized before processing with ssem-lasso algorithm. the original and modified training networks  were used to determine ranks of target genes for each experiment. raw data was obtained from published experiments  or conducted in in-house, as indicated in footnotes. average ranks for duplicate experiments are shown.

graphs in figure 9a-d display five representative fl treatment experiments on the x-axis and rc values for erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig> or spt <dig> on the y-axis. these results showed that each modification to the training compendium induced changes to the gene network that were unique to the deletion strain’s corresponding target gene. erg <dig>  erg <dig>  and erg <dig> ranks dropped, or improved, only with the addition of expression data from erg11Δ/erg <dig>  erg6Δ, and hem1Δ, respectively. in contrast to the addition of genetic deletions, inclusion of expression data from the fl treatment experiment did not impact network interactions to alter erg <dig>  erg <dig> and erg <dig> ranks. in most cases, ranks stayed the same or worsened with the addition of fl drug treatment expression data .

erg <dig> rcs for all fl treatment experiments dropped substantially when erg <dig> deletion expression data was added to the training compendium. erg <dig> ranks were in the 97th, 92th, 96th, 88th, or 94th percentile of rcs for each of the five experiments . inclusion of erg <dig> deletion expression data into the training compendium also improved prediction of erg <dig> perturbations across all fl experiments. in fact, inclusion of the haploid erg6Δ experiment to the training compendium produced a more pronounced drop in erg <dig> ranks than the heterozygous erg11Δ/erg <dig> experiment did for erg <dig> ranks. erg <dig> rc percentiles were in the range of  <dig> to  <dig>  with the exception of the flgi <dig>  4dt experiment . addition of hem1Δ expression data also improved erg <dig> ranks for all fl treatment experiments, and erg <dig> rcs were in the 97th, 75th, 97th, 95th, or 90th percentiles . erg <dig> rank improvements were similar in magnitude and direction to those of erg <dig>  this result suggested that erg <dig> and erg <dig> were similarly affected by fl, and also by heme depletion, supporting their synergy along the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and fl’s interactions with their cyp heme centers.

to test if network changes induced by erg11Δ/erg <dig>  erg6Δ and hem1Δ were specific to fl, we analyzed whether haploid spt3Δ expression data improved spt <dig> ranks for the same fl experiments. spt3p, a subunit of saga-type histone acetyltransferase complex, is not specifically targeted by fl. indeed, inclusion of spt3Δ expression data did not significantly alter spt <dig> rank across the representative fl experiments; three of the ranks increased while two widely fluctuated .

training phase: a further application of network variations to nocodazole gene target predictions
we explored if these findings were applicable to nocodazole , an antimitotic benzimidazole drug that destabilizes microtubules and causes cell cycle arrest in mitosis  <cit> . tub <dig> is one of two functional genes  that encodes for α-tubulin, an essential protein of the α,β-tubulin heterodimer  <cit> . α,β-tubulin polymerizes into microtubules, which are critical components of the mitotic and meiotic spindles and essential for cell division  <cit> . we hypothesized that addition of microarray expression data from a tub1Δ/tub <dig> deletion strain could potentially improve tub <dig> rank in noc treatment experiments.

all experiments were performed in by <dig> strains using the same media and conditions that were used in fl experiments. we determined noc treatment concentrations using dose-response curves and growth inhibitory values  as we did for fl. studies have shown that s. cerevisiae haploid cells treated with noc  rapidly disassemble microtubules in the majority of the cell population, resulting in mitotic arrest with intact nuclei  <cit> . we chose a concentration slightly lower,  <dig> μm, which corresponded to gi <dig>  and incubation intervals of  <dig> and  <dig> ets.

interestingly, ssem-lasso did not predict tub <dig> perturbation as well as it did for erg <dig> with the original training set. still, upon addition of tub <dig> deletion expression data, ranks dropped by over  <dig>  and tub <dig> rcs were in the top 98% and 97% of all rcs for gi <dig>  3et and gi <dig>  4et experiments, respectively .

discussion
impact of testing phase variations on ssem-lasso predictions of gene sets
ssem-lasso was originally developed to identify a directly targeted gene of a genetic or drug perturbation  <cit> . we sought to expand the algorithm’s utility by testing its ability to predict drug perturbations over several biological conditions and on a set of biologically-related genes, rather than on a single gene target. this was the first study that analyzed ssem-lasso output using roc curves and corresponding auc values for a group of predefined genes.

fl treatment of s. cerevisiae results in inhibition of lanosterol demethylation and subsequent depletion of ergosterol and accumulation of toxic methylated sterol precursors. this results in cell membrane damage and impaired fatty acid and lipid biosyntheses  <cit> . fl coordinates to erg11p’s heme iron impairing cytochrome-related processes, such as mitochondrial respiration . we created a gene set based on these biological processes, called fl-interacters. experimental variations in et and concentration manifested perturbations that followed a clear trend and were specific to the fl-interacters gene set. an et of at least four cell doublings in the presence of drug proved optimal for accurate prediction of fl-interacters  concentration changes did not exert as strong of an effect as et, and any concentration between gi <dig> and gi <dig> proved optimal to induce target-gene perturbations . our results demonstrated that experimental “input” variables could be successfully optimized to identify a set of related genes targeted by a drug. our methodology could therefore provide an experimental platform for future studies aimed at predicting drug targets at the multi-gene or pathway level.

in principle, given the training/testing paradigm common to the core of statistical and machine learning methods in general, the spirit of the analyses carried out in this study may be similarly used in exploring the sensitivity of other methods of drug-target prediction methods. however, researchers should be aware that optimal experimental conditions determined in this study are exquisitely linked to ssem-lasso and fl. drugs with different modes-of-action, potencies, and potential for off-target effects may have dissimilar effects on gene expression under these reported experimental conditions. further, fl effects could manifest dissimilar genetic perturbations when analyzed with a new statistical model. finally, depending on the algorithm or supervised learning method, results may be more or less sensitive to experimental changes than those reported with ssem-lasso. therefore, the approach would need to be adapted to the specifics of the measurements at hand, which have tended to vary in the literature . nevertheless, this study provides a good starting point for researchers to obtain accurate drug target predictions using microarray technology.

impact of testing phase variations on ssem-lasso drug target predictions at the single gene level
in our study, ssem-lasso accurately predicted fl single gene targets upon drug treatment, yet experimental variables did not dramatically affect biological outcomes. with the exception of erg <dig> , erg <dig>  upc <dig>  and hap <dig> ranks did not significantly fluctuate over varying treatment conditions.

 fl is known to target erg <dig> , erg <dig>  upc <dig>  and hap <dig>  so these genes were tracked to evaluate optimal experimental conditions. unlike gene set predictions, ssem-lasso prediction of erg <dig> perturbation was relatively unchanging over multiple testing phase modifications . these results demonstrated that changes in erg <dig> expression caused by changes in et and concentration were not significantly detected by ssem-lasso above the background gene-gene interaction “patterns” in the network. erg <dig> expression, on the other hand, responded to longer fl exposure times, with four ets yielding an optimal erg <dig> rank in the top 87% of ranked genes . furthermore, erg <dig> ranked consistently lower than erg <dig> across all fl concentration experiments . erg <dig> encodes for Δ  <cit> -sterol c-methyltransferase, an enzyme downstream of erg11p that synthesizes fecosterol, an important precursor to ergosterol . fl effects may have manifested more prominently on erg <dig> than on erg <dig> because of the cell’s reliance on erg6p for pleiotropic cellular processes, including membrane rigidity and permeability, genetic transformation, conjugation and tryptophan uptake  <cit> . furthermore, erg6p places a high demand on the cell for metabolic energy, 12- <dig> atp equivalents, to perform transmethylation reactions  <cit> . another reason erg <dig> may have ranked lower than erg <dig> involves the unnatural accumulation of lanosterol and/or the depletion of ergosterol as a result of erg11p inhibition by fl. disruption of later stage ergosterol biosynthesis enzymes, like erg6p, has been attributed to the build up of reactant metabolites along the ergosterol pathway  <cit> . furthermore, genome-wide microarray studies have found the most responsive genes to ketoconaozle function downstream of erg <dig>  suggesting their induction is induced by ergosterol depletion  <cit> .

metabolic vs. transcription factor gene target predictions
a different trend, in comparison to metabolic enzymes erg <dig> and erg <dig>  was observed for transcription factors, upc <dig> and hap <dig>  upc2p induces the transcription of ergosterol biosynthesis genes upon sterol depletion  <cit> . previous microarray studies in s. cerevisiae had identified induced upc <dig> expression in response to ketoconaozle  <cit> . this result was consistent with the fl-induced upc <dig> perturbation observed in this study. ssem-lasso pinpointed upc <dig> dysregulation by fl, with ranks in the 99th percentile at four ets and a range of concentrations . depending on the presence of heme, hap1p can bind the promoters of genes to activate or repress their expressions for aerobic or hypoxic growth, such as the cyp <dig> enzymes, erg <dig> and erg <dig> <cit> . hence, erg gene expressions are highly dependent on hap <dig> gene interactions and the aerobic state of the cell. additionally, hap1p represses transcription of its own gene by at least 20-fold in a heat shock protein-dependent manner  <cit> . ranks for hap <dig> were comparable to upc <dig> ranks, all performing significantly better than other genes at three and four ets at higher fl concentrations . to factor perturbations better than metabolic enzymes in the context of a drug treatment.

we discovered that the type of molecular target – metabolic enzyme or transcription factor, upstream or downstream – can play a large role in the overall performance of the algorithm.

training phase variables significantly improve single gene target predictions
the goal of ssem-lasso’s training phase was to infer a gene interaction network that filtered out gene-gene regulatory “patterns” so that genes experiencing a true additive shift in their transcript signals emerged above the gene network background. in this study, modified training compendiums, the training phase “variables”, were created by adding of new gene deletion data to the training compendium. each modified training compendium shifted the network’s internal gene regulatory influences so that ssem-lasso more accurately predicted single gene targets. this was evidenced by significant rank decreases for erg <dig>  erg <dig> and erg <dig> upon addition of erg11Δ/erg <dig>  erg6Δ, and hem1Δ data, respectively, to the training compendium . the erg6Δ haploid deletion induced the most pronounced decrease in erg <dig> rank predictions. this could be a result of more potent and specific transcriptional effects of the erg6Δ knockout compared to the partial knockout, erg11Δ/erg <dig>  or the hem1Δ strain, which was shown to induce widespread transcriptional effects on many cellular processes  <cit> .

additional studies involving noc treatment and tub <dig> expression supported these fl findings. rank changes for noc target, tub <dig>  dropped significantly when the original training compendium was modified with tub1Δ/tub <dig> deletion data . only one replicate experiment of two noc conditions, gi <dig>  <dig> dt and gi <dig>  <dig> dt, was performed for this drug target study, which is a limitation to the analysis. finally, rank improvements of a non-fl-targeted gene, such as spt <dig>  were not manifested with addition of corresponding haploid spt3Δ expression data to the compendium . when taken together, these results indicated that gene targets and the modified training compendium should be specific to the drug under investigation in order to improve ssem-lasso’s performance. still, further training phase variations concerning other drug treatments and deletion strains, and including more replicates, are necessary to assess the applicability of this strategy to various drug-target predictions.

it was initially hypothesized that addition of fl treatment expression data to the training compendium could also minimize background gene-gene interactions specific to fl’s effects. this was not the case, as inclusion of the fl experiment, gi <dig>  4et, modified gene regulatory “patterns” in a negative manner, increasing ranks for fl targets. this led to the conclusion that genetic knockouts produced more distinct and local effects on the network as opposed to “noiser” and potentially off-target perturbations induced with an exogenous compound. additionally, s. cerevisiae is susceptible to “neighboring gene effects”, whereby the phenotype of a particular strain  could be due to the effect the perturbation exerts not on the target gene, but on an “adjacent” gene  <cit> . with around 10% of all yeast genes experiencing this type of influence  <cit> , it was possible that there were too many “neighboring” expression changes induced by a foreign compound, and thus “noise” was enhanced and direct fl gene targets were pushed further into the background.

the training phase variables caused dramatic improvements in ssem-lasso performance compared to the minor rank fluctuations observed for experimental testing variations. thus, when examining a drug’s potential effects using microarray data and our methodology, the experimental conditions played a more important role in predicting a gene set. on the other hand, fine-tuning of the computational variable, i.e. the gene interaction network, proved more critical for accurate predictions of single gene drug targets.

ssem-lasso utility for the prediction of unknown drug targets
these results suggest a unique, two-stage approach to predict an unknown drug target using genome-wide microarray data and a network-inference model, such as ssem-lasso. first, detection of one or more perturbed gene sets should hone in on one or more biological pathways affected by the drug in question. in the case of ssem-lasso, these pathways were set a priori by the experimentalist, permitting a more focused analysis of drug-induced effects. once a target pathway is elucidated, genetic deletion data specific to genes along the target pathway can be added to the training data. single gene results can then be analyzed under different network training conditions and compared to arrive at more accurate drug gene target predictions. genes experiencing greater rank changes with the addition of their respective genetic deletion data to the training compendium can be considered more likely candidate drug targets.

CONCLUSIONS
the goal of this study was to improve our understanding of the interaction between biological testing and computational training variables in order to produce more accurate predictions of drug action at the transcriptional level. previously, the network-inference model, ssem-lasso, predicted molecular targets of genetic mutations more accurately than drug treatments. we discovered a two-stage approach that addressed this issue and outlined improved experimental and computational conditions for predictions of first, drug pathway and second, single gene targets. experimentally, the duration cells are in contact with a compound and the changes in compound concentration do not have a dramatic effect on single gene targets. however, these variables must be optimized for more accurate target predictions at the gene set/pathway level. computationally, addition of specific biologically-motivated expression data to the interaction network can influence the gene regulatory effects in a manner that better resolves perturbations at the single gene level. with these variables in mind, ssem-lasso, and by extension, similar computational methods, can be a tremendously useful tool for therapeutic discovery when implemented under the appropriately informed testing and training conditions.
