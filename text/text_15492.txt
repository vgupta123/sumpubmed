BACKGROUND
plant cell walls are complex and dynamic structures composed mainly of polysaccharides , phenolic compounds  and glycoproteins  <cit> . xylans are the major hemicellulosic saccharides in the primary cell walls of grasses and the secondary cell walls of grasses and dicots, ranking as the second most abundant polysaccharides in nature  <cit> . xylans are mainly composed of a linear backbone of β--linked d-xylosyl residues with various sidechains that vary among different plant species and tissue types  <cit> . based on the sidechain substitutions, xylans can generally be classified as glucuronoxylan , arabinoxylan , and glucuronoarabinoxylan   <cit> . as the major xylan in dicot plants, gx is usually decorated with α- <dig> -linked glucuronic acid  or 4-o-methylglucuronic acid , and acetylated at c- <dig> or c- <dig>  <cit> . ax has α- <dig> -linked arabinose  sidechains, and presents as typical hemicellulose components in starchy endosperm of cereal grains  <cit> . gax is the predominant hemicellulose in grass cell walls, and has sidechains of α- <dig>  or α- <dig> -linked arabinose  and glca residues  <cit> . in addition, gx in angiosperm and gax in several gymnosperm species contain a tetrasaccharide sequence  at the reducing end . however, no such oligosaccharide has yet been identified for xylans in grasses  <cit> . it is still in controversy whether this oligosaccharide functions as a primer or as a terminator in xylan backbone biosynthesis  <cit> .

several xylan-related mutants named as irregular xylem  due to secondary cell wall deficiencies have been identified in arabidopsis by reverse genetics approaches  <cit> . most of these identified genes encode putative glycosyltransferases  that are involved in the biosynthesis of xylan. irx9/irx9l and irx14/irx14l from gt <dig> family as well as irx10/irx10l from gt <dig> family are responsible for the biosynthesis of xylan backbone . irx <dig>  irx <dig> and irx <dig> play dominant roles in xylan backbone biosynthesis, and mutations in each gene lead to reduced xylan content and growth defect. by contrast, irx9l, irx10l and irx14l seem to perform partially redundant roles together with their close homologues, as loss-function of these genes have no observable phenotypes and they only partially complement the phenotypes of irx <dig>  irx <dig> and irx <dig> mutants. in addition, double mutations in each gene pairs dramatically enhance the phenotypes of the single mutant  <cit> . however, a recent study proposed that these gene pairs play equivalent roles in xylan biosynthesis  <cit> . furthermore, two members of duf <dig> domain-containing proteins, irx <dig> and irx15l, are essential for the normal elongation of xylan backbone  <cit> . irx7/irx7l from gt <dig> family, irx <dig> and parvus from gt <dig> family are required for the biosynthesis of the reducing end oligosaccharide . mutations in these genes lead to almost entirely loss of the tetrasaccharide accompanied with reduced xylan contents, while the xylan backbone elongation activity is not disturbed .

recently biochemical and genetic studies have also led to the identification of several genes that are required for the sidechain modifications of xylan. for instance, glucuronic acid substitution of xylan   <dig>  gux <dig>  gux <dig> and gux <dig> from gt <dig> family are proposed to catalyze the addition of glca and meglca sidechains to gx backbone . glucuronoxylan methyltransferase   <dig>  a duf <dig> domain protein, has been revealed to be responsible for the 4-o-methylation of glca residues in gx  <cit> . in addition, eskimo1/trichome birefringence-like   <dig>  a duf <dig> domain protein, is required for the o-acetylation of xylan backbone  <cit> . moreover, several xylan arabinosyltransferase , members of gt <dig> family proteins from rice and wheat, are responsible for transferring the ara residues onto xylan backbone  <cit> . xylosyl arabinosyl substitution of xylan   <dig>  another member from gt <dig> family in rice, is involved in transferring the xyl residues in β-xylp--α-araf - sidechain  <cit> .

grass xylans have several unique features compared to those from dicots. gx is the most abundant hemicellulose in dicots, while grass xylans usually contain many ara residue substitutions and thus are termed as gax or ax  <cit> . even though there are clear differences in xylan structure between grasses and dicots, accumulating evidence implicates that gt <dig> members are functionally conserved in xylan biosynthesis between dicots and monocots. for example, four rice irx <dig> orthologues osgt43a, osgt43c, osgt43e and osgt43f can fully or partially rescue the xylan defect phenotype of irx <dig>  while osgt43j is able to complement the xylan defect phenotype of irx <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . three poplar irx <dig> orthologues ptrgt43a, ptrgt43b and ptrgt43e are capable of rescuing the defects of irx <dig>  whereas the other two irx <dig> orthologues ptrgt43c and ptrgt43d are able to complement the phenotypes of irx <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, it has been demonstrated that rice and poplar gt <dig> family proteins are evolved to retain two functionally non-redundant groups involved in xylan backbone biosynthesis . additionally, two gt <dig> members ghgt43a <dig> and ghgt43c <dig> from cotton have been revealed to be functional orthologues of arabidopsis irx <dig> and irx <dig>  respectively, and have been shown to participate in xylan backbone biosynthesis during fiber development  <cit> .

miscanthus is a perennial rhizomatous grass with superior characteristics as a bioenergy plant such as high photosynthetic efficiency, low fertilizer and water demand, wide adaptability and high biomass yield. it has attracted increasing attention and concern worldwide as an ideal lignocellulosic feedstock for next-generation bioenergy production . hemicelluloses account for 29– <dig> % of the miscanthus cell walls  <cit> , and the most abundant hemicellulosic polysaccharide is ax  <cit> , which is also the typical xylan in grass cell walls  <cit> . it has been shown that hemicellulose exerts dominant and positive effects on biomass digestibility by affecting cellulose crystallinity after pre-treatment with alkali or acid  <cit> . although much progress has been gained in the understanding of xylan biosynthesis in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana, relatively less is known about xylan biosynthesis in grasses. to the best of our knowledge, none of gts responsible for the biosynthesis of xylan has been isolated and characterized in miscanthus as yet.

to provide insight into xylan biosynthesis in miscanthus, we identified seven gt <dig> genes in m. lutarioriparius and characterized their functional roles in xylan biosynthesis. complementation assay including plant height, irregular xylem cells in stem cross sections and xylose content measurements revealed that mlgt <dig> genes have evolved into two distinct functional groups, in which mlgt43a-e are orthologous to irx <dig>  while mlgt43f and mlgt43g are orthologous to irx <dig>  furthermore, our results indicated that substantial divergence has occurred in the functional roles of mlgt43s during xylan biosynthesis especially in seed coat mucilage. the results presented deepened our understanding of xylan biosynthesis in grasses and may lay the foundation for future genetic manipulation of miscanthus cell wall structure and components.

RESULTS
isolation of gt <dig> genes in m. lutarioriparius
to identify the gt <dig> family in m. lutarioriparius, the amino acid sequences of four arabidopsis gt <dig> members were used as query baits to blast against the draft genome sequences of m. lutarioriparius, and seven gt <dig> orthologous genes were identified. specific primers were designed and seven candidate genes encoding putative gt <dig> proteins designated as mlgt43a to mlgt43g were obtained by pcr in m. lutarioriparius. as indicated in fig. 1a, all seven proteins had a conserved structure and ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. pairwise comparison of the amino acid sequences showed that mlgt43c and mlgt43d shared the highest sequence similarity , while mlgt43d and mlgt43g shared the lowest sequence similarity  .fig.  <dig> sequence alignment, identities and gene structure of mlgt <dig>  a sequence alignment of seven mlgt <dig> proteins. b sequence identities and similarities among mlgt <dig> proteins. the highest and lowest in sequence identity and similarity are outlined. c gene structure of mlgt <dig> genes. exons and introns are represented by filled boxes and lines, respectively. the sizes of exons and introns are proportional to the scale at bottom



deduced mlgt43a and mlgt43b amino acid sequences shared the highest sequence identities with arabidopsis irx <dig> , and mlgt43c-e shared relatively higher sequence identities with irx9l  than with irx <dig> or irx14l. by contrast, mlgt43f and mlgt43g proteins had the highest sequence identities with irx <dig> and irx14l  than with irx <dig> .

furthermore, the gene structure of each mlgt <dig> was obtained through the alignment of their coding sequences and genomic sequences . all mlgt <dig> genes shared very similar gene structure in terms of intron number and exon length. they all contained three exons and two introns. in addition, the intron phases with respect to codons were well conserved among different mlgt <dig> genes.

phylogenetic analysis of gt <dig> members from m. lutarioriparius and other plant species
to gain insight into the origin and evolutionary history of the gt <dig> family, we further identified gt <dig> proteins from nine other currently sequenced genomes that cover a wide spectrum of plant taxonomic groups including moss , spikemoss , the monocot angiosperms , and the dicot angiosperms . totally  <dig> gt <dig> proteins were identified from these nine plant species  and a phylogenetic tree was constructed with these gt <dig> proteins . the phylogenetic tree separated all gt <dig> proteins into three distinct subfamilies designated as irx <dig>  irx9l and irx14/irx14l, which was similar to the previous studies  <cit> . the seven gt <dig> proteins from miscanthus were classified into the three subfamilies. mlgt43a and mlgt43b were clustered into the irx <dig> subfamily, mlgt43c-e were classified into the irx9l subfamily, while mlgt43f and mlgt43g were distributed into the irx14/irx14l subfamily.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of gt <dig> family from miscanthus and nine other plant species. a phylogenetic tree of  <dig> gt <dig> proteins from ten plant species. the sequences of  <dig> gt <dig> proteins were aligned using clustalw and their phylogenetic relationship was analyzed using the neighbor-joining method in mega  <dig> . numbers at nodes indicate the percentage bootstrap scores and only bootstrap values higher than 50% from  <dig>  replicates are shown. mlgt <dig> proteins are marked with asterisks. b distribution of the gt <dig> proteins from selected plant lineages. pp, physcomitrella patens; sm, selaginella moellendorffii; at, arabidopsis thaliana; pt, populus trichocarpa; mt, medicago truncatula; vv, vitis vinifera; os, oryza sativa; bd, brachypodium distachyon; sb, sorghum bicolor; ml, miscanthus lutarioriparius




the distribution of the three subgroups among the ten plant species varied within each subfamily . it is noteworthy that the number of gt <dig> proteins in the monocot species seems to be higher than that of the dicot species, at least it is the case for the selected plant species. for example, there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members in the monocot species o. sativa, b. distachyon, s. bicolor and m. lutarioriparius, whereas the number of gt <dig> in the dicot species a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa, m. truncatula and v. vinifera were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in addition, the members of irx <dig> and irx9l subfamilies in the monocot angiosperms were generally higher than those of the dicot species. for instance, the irx <dig> subfamily accounted for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> % in the monocot species o. sativa, b. distachyon, s. bicolor and m. lutarioriparius, respectively, whereas the percentages of the irx <dig> subfamily in the dicot species a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa, m. truncatula and v. vinifera were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> %, respectively. noticeably, no irx <dig> subfamily members were present in p. patens and s. moellendorffii.

mlgt <dig> genes are ubiquitously expressed and have specific expressions in stem cells
to investigate the expression patterns of mlgt <dig> genes, we first used the quantitative real-time rt-pcr  to examine their expressions across seven different tissues. as shown in fig. 3a, all seven mlgt <dig> genes were ubiquitously expressed in seven different tissues examined, but their relative expression levels differed significantly. for example, mlgt43a, mlgt43d and mlgt43e genes shared similar expression patterns with predominant expressions in leaf, whereas the expressions of mlgt43b and mlgt43g genes were relatively lower. mlgt43c and mlgt43f genes were broadly expressed in the majority of the tissues, while especially higher expressions were detected in the basal stem. furthermore, all mlgt <dig> genes except mlgt43b exhibited higher expressions in the basal stem than in the upper stem.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of mlgt <dig> genes. a expression analysis of mlgt <dig> genes by qrt-pcr. relative expression levels in seven tissues were normalized using mlact <dig> as the reference gene. for each gene, the tissues with the lowest expression level are set to  <dig>  data are the means ± se of three biological replicates. b in situ localization of mlgt <dig> genes in miscanthus stem. cross-sections of stems were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled antisense mlgt43a , mlgt43b , mlgt43c , mlgt43d , mlgt43e , mlgt43f , mlgt43g , or sense  rna probes, and the hybridization signals were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody and were shown as purple color. pv, pitted vessel; x, xylem; ph, phloem; pa, parenchyma; sc, sclerenchyma. bar =  <dig> μm



to obtain more detailed expression patterns of mlgt <dig> genes in specific cell types, we further performed the in situ hybridization analysis to examine their expressions in the 11th internode of the stem. for all seven genes, intense hybridization signals were observed in sclerenchyma cells and vascular bundle fiber cells, the cell types undergoing secondary wall thickening . moreover, relatively weak hybridization signals were also observed for mlgt43c-e in parenchyma cells. by contrast, the control hybridized with sense probes did not show any signals in vascular bundle or sclerenchyma cells . these results suggest that mlgt <dig> genes may participate in diverse plant development processes especially in the secondary cell wall formation.

mlgt <dig> members are targeted to golgi apparatus
to investigate the subcellular localization of mlgt <dig> proteins, we constructed fluorescently tagged fusion proteins by fusing yellow fluorescent protein  to the c terminus of each mlgt <dig> protein. the recombinant constructs were transiently co-expressed in nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells with the golgi marker man49-mcherry  <cit> . examination of the fluorescent signals revealed that seven yfp-tagged mlgt43s all exhibited a punctate distribution, and the pattern perfectly matched with that of man49-mcherry , whereas the yfp control protein had signals throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus . the co-localization of mlgt <dig> proteins with the golgi marker indicate that mlgt43s are golgi-localized proteins.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of yfp-tagged mlgt <dig> proteins. yfp-tagged mlgt <dig> proteins were transiently expressed in leaf epidermal cells of nicotiana benthamiana, and their subcellular locations were examined with a laser scanning confocal microscope. the single-plane confocal micrographs of mlgt <dig> proteins fused with c-terminal yfp, the golgi marker man49-mcherry, differential interference contrast  image, and merged yfp and mcherry channels are shown. note the superimposition of yfp-mlgt43s and man49-mcherry signals. bar =  <dig> μm



mlgt <dig> genes rescue the morphological defects of irx <dig> or irx14
to reveal whether mlgt <dig> genes perform the same functions as irx <dig> and irx <dig> orthologues in arabidopsis, we examined their abilities to rescue the morphological defects of irx <dig> and irx <dig>  due to the severely dwarfed plant stature and poor fertility of homozygous irx <dig> plants  <cit> , we used the heterozygous line for the transformation with the 35s:mlgt43s constructs. positive transgenic lines for each construct were tested for the presence of mlgt <dig> genes in homozygous irx <dig> and irx <dig> background by semi-quantitative rt-pcr . homozygous t <dig> plants from at least two independent transformants with higher expressions were used for the phenotypic analyses.fig.  <dig> expression of seven mlgt <dig> genes in arabidopsis irx <dig> or irx <dig> mutants. a rt-pcr detection of the mlgt <dig> transcripts in the complemented irx <dig> or irx <dig> plants. the arabidopsis ubq <dig> gene was used as a reference. b, d, f phenotype of four-, six- and eight-week-old soil-grown wt, irx <dig> and mlgt43s complemented irx <dig> plants. c, e, g phenotype of four-, six- and eight-week-old soil-grown wt, irx <dig> and mlgt43s complemented irx <dig> plants. h stem height of the wt, irx <dig> and mlgt43s complemented irx <dig> plants through  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> days of growth. i stem height of the wt, irx <dig> and mlgt43s complemented irx <dig> plants through  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> days of growth. data are means ± sd from at least twelve plants for each background. two homozygous t <dig> lines of mlgt43s complemented irx <dig> or irx <dig> were used in the analysis



the growth of the irx <dig> plants was characterized by the dwarf stature, smaller rosette size and dark-green leaves under our growth conditions, which is similar to the previous reports  <cit> . overexpression of mlgt43a-e genes in irx <dig> displayed an intermediate growth phenotype between the mutant and the wild type  in terms of rosette size and inflorescence height. the rosette diameters of the complemented plants increased by two- to three-fold, and the inflorescence stems were two- to four-fold taller compared to the irx <dig> plants after four weeks of growth , suggesting that the irx phenotype may be partially complemented in these transformants. by contrast, transformants of mlgt43f or mlgt43g overexpression in irx <dig> mutant exhibited a morphology resembled of the irx <dig> mutant, indicating that mlgt43f and mlgt43g were unable to complement the irx <dig> phenotypes .

the growth of irx <dig> mutant did not show any other obvious phenotypes except for a slight reduction in plant height compared to wt  as described previously  <cit> . the height of all mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> plants was indistinguishable from that of irx <dig> or wt plants, thus it is hard to evaluate the ability of seven mlgt <dig> genes to complement the irx <dig> mutant merely judged from their growth phenotypes. subsequently, xylem morphology, xylan immunolocalization and cell wall monosaccharide compositions will be further examined in the transgenic plants to determine the abilities of mlgt43s to complement the irx <dig> phenotypes.

microscopic analysis of the secondary cell wall
to demonstrate whether the morphological complementation by mlgt <dig> genes could be accompanied with the rescue of xylem morphology, the basal inflorescence stems of each complemented line were sectioned and observed by light and transmission electron microscopy. toluidine blue o  staining was performed on stem sections of wt, irx <dig>  irx <dig> and complemented plants to examine the morphology of secondary cell walls. as shown in fig.  <dig>  all mlgt43a-e complemented irx <dig> plants exhibited dramatically thickened cell walls in interfascicular fibers compared to irx <dig>  the majority of xylem vessels in mlgt43a and mlgt43b complemented irx <dig> plants were characterized by large open round cells comparable to those in wt plants . in addition, the xylem vessels of mlgt43c, mlgt43d or mlgt43e complemented irx <dig> plants were usually smaller in size with occasionally irregular shapes, probably due to the not fully thickened cell walls compared to wt . by contrast, overexpression of mlgt43f or mlgt43g in irx <dig> could not restore the collapsed vessels and the weakly thickened interfascicular fibers in irx <dig> , which is in consistency with their growth phenotypes .fig.  <dig> morphology of xylem and interfascicular fibers of wt, irx <dig>  irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented plants. stems of eight-week-old plants were sectioned  and stained with tbo for examination of the morphology of vessels, xylary fibers and interfascicular fibers. a1-i <dig>  interfasicular fibers for wt, irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> plants. a2-i <dig>  interfasicular fibers for wt, irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> plants. j1-r <dig>  xylary fibers and vessels for wt, irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> plants. j2-r <dig>  xylary fibers and vessels for wt, irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> plants. at least two homozygous t <dig> lines of mlgt43s complemented irx <dig> or irx <dig> were used in the analysis. images for each tissue are set as the same magnification. bar =  <dig> μm



the homozygous irx <dig> plants also showed collapsed xylem vessels and thinner secondary cell walls, which is consistent with the previous study  <cit> . overexpression of either mlgt43f or mlgt43g could almost fully rescue the irx phenotype of irx <dig> as witnessed by a relatively less irregular vessel cells compared to irx <dig>  however, the complemented lines still retained relatively thinner cell walls in both interfascicular fibers and xylem vessels compared to wt . by contrast, overexpression of mlgt43a-e in irx <dig> displayed a collapsed xylem vessel and thinner fiber cell wall phenotype that was indistinguishable from the irx <dig> mutant , indicating that mlgt43a-e genes could not rescue the defects of irx <dig> 

transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the thickness of interfascicular fiber cell walls of the mlgt43a-e complemented irx <dig> plants was intermediate between irx <dig> and wt . meanwhile, the wall thickness of xylary fibers and vessels in mlgt43a-e complemented irx <dig> lines was also significantly increased but not restored to the wt level. by contrast, the wall thickness of interfascicular fibers, xylary fibers and vessels of mlgt43f or mlgt43g complemented irx <dig> plants was similar to that of the irx <dig> mutant . the wall thickness of interfascicular fibers, xylary fibers and vessels for mlgt43f or mlgt43g complemented irx <dig> plants was intermediate between irx <dig> and wt, while the wall thickness for mlgt43a-e complemented irx <dig> lines was similar to that of irx <dig> . together, these results indicate that mlgt43a-e can fully or partially rescue the irx <dig> but not the irx <dig> phenotypes, while mlgt43f and mlgt43g can complement the irx <dig> but not the irx <dig> defects.fig.  <dig> transmission electron micrographs of stem sections of wt, irx <dig>  irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented plants. stems of eight-week-old plants were cut into  <dig> nm-thick sections and observed with transmission electron microscope, indicating increased fiber and vessel wall thickness by expression of mlgt <dig> genes. a, transmission electron micrographs of stem sections of mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> lines. b, transmission electron micrographs of stem sections of mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> lines. at least two homozygous lines of mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> or irx <dig> were used in the analysis. ve, vessels, xf, xylary fibers. bar =  <dig> μm

at least two independent transgenic lines for each construct were used for measurement. wt, irx <dig>  and irx <dig> were included for comparison. eight-week-old plants for each background were used for analysis. wall thickness was measured from transmission electron micrographs of fibers and vessels. data are means  ± se from  <dig> cells



immunolocalization of xylan in mlgt43s complemented lines
to investigate whether the phenotypes of the complemented plants are correlated with xylan deposition in secondary cell walls, we performed immunolocalization of xylan using the xylan-directed monoclonal antibody lm <dig>  which recognizes unsubstituted or low-substituted xylan  <cit> , to examine the distribution of xylan in the cell walls. as indicated in fig.  <dig>  strong fluorescence signals were present in the cell walls of interfascicular fibers and xylem cells in the wt stem, however, relatively weaker signals were detected in the corresponding tissues of the irx <dig> plants, although the overall pattern of labeling was unchanged compared with the wt plants . in mlgt43a and mlgt43b complemented irx <dig> lines, the intensity of fluorescence signals was almost restored to the wt level, and the overall pattern of labeling was almost identical to that of wt, indicating that the gx content in interfascicular fibers and xylem cells was nearly restored to the wt level . the lm <dig> signals in the mlgt43c-e complemented irx <dig> plants were intermediate between irx <dig> and wt plants . by contrast, the lm <dig> signals for mlgt43f and mlgt43g complemented irx <dig> lines were relatively weaker compared with the others, and the intensity was comparable to that of the irx <dig> mutant . as for the irx <dig> background, the intensity of fluorescence signals of mlgt43f and mlgt43g complemented lines was comparable to that of wt in xylem cells and interfascicular fibers . by contrast, mlgt43a-e complemented irx <dig> lines exhibited nearly equal signal intensity to the irx <dig> mutant . these results indicate that mlgt43a-e perform a similar biochemical function as irx <dig>  whereas mlgt43f and mlgt43g share a conserved biochemical function with irx <dig>  thus leading to a restoration of normal xylan synthesis in their complemented plants.fig.  <dig> immunolocalization of xylan using the monoclonal antibody lm <dig>  labelling was carried out on  <dig> μm-thick transverse sections from stem tissues of eight-week-old plants. a1-i1: xylan immumolocalization in wt, irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> lines. a2-t2: xylan immunolocalization in wt, irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> lines. signals were detected with alexa fluor488-conjugated secondary antibody and observed with a bx <dig> fluorescence microscope . bar =  <dig> μm



analysis of cell wall composition
to determine whether the complementation of xylem morphology and xylan deposition is correlated with the restoration of chemical composition, we measured the monosaccharide composition, cellulose and lignin contents of the transgenic lines. monosaccharide composition analysis was performed on cell wall preparations from eight-week-old inflorescence stems of wt, irx <dig>  irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented lines . the xyl content in irx <dig> was decreased by  <dig> % compared to wt, whereas it was decreased more dramatically in irx <dig>  with only  <dig> % of the wt. the transgenic plants overexpressing mlgt43a and mlgt43b in irx <dig> significantly increased the content of xyl to  <dig> and  <dig> % of the wt level, respectively. a modest increase was also observed in the mlgt43c-e complemented irx <dig> lines. however, no significant increases in xyl content were observed in mlgt43f or mlgt43g complemented irx <dig> lines compared to irx <dig>  overexpression of mlgt43f and mlgt43g in irx <dig> restored the xyl content to  <dig> and  <dig> % of the wt, respectively. the xyl content of mlgt43a-e complemented irx <dig> plants was individually increased by approximately  <dig> to  <dig> % compared to irx <dig> fig.  <dig> monosaccharide composition of cell walls isolated from the stems of wt, irx <dig>  irx <dig> and mlgt <dig> complemented plants. cell walls were prepared from inflorescence stems of eight-week-old plants and their glycosyl compositions were determined by hplc. data are means ± sd of three independent analyses



in addition, mutations of irx <dig> and irx <dig> caused significant reductions in cellulose and lignin contents compared to wt. not unexpectedly, overexpression of mlgt43a-e but not mlgt43f and mlgt43g in irx <dig> restored the contents of cellulose and lignin almost to the wt level. similarly, overexpression of mlgt43f and mlgt43g but not mlgt43a-e in irx <dig> recovered the levels of cellulose and lignin nearly to the wt level . these results further indicate that mlgt43a-e but not mlgt43f-g can partially restore the xylan biosynthesis in irx <dig>  while mlgt43f-g but not mlgt43a-e are able to rescue the xylan biosynthesis defect in irx <dig>  suggesting that mlgt43a-e are orthologous to irx <dig>  while mlgt43f and mlgt43g are orthologous to irx <dig> 

transactivation assay for mlgt <dig> genes
snd <dig> , vnd <dig>  and myb <dig> have been shown to act as the master switches in the regulatory network of secondary cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . to better understand the underlying regulatory mechanism of mlgt <dig> genes, we isolated the orthologues of snd <dig>  vnd <dig> and myb <dig> in m. lutarioriparius and analyzed their transactivation abilities on promlgt43a-e:gus reporters using a transient transactivation assay . the results showed that mlgt43a was transactivated by mlsnd <dig>  mlmyb46a, mlmyb46b and mlvnd <dig>  mlgt43b was also transactivated by mlsnd <dig>  mlmyb46a, but not by mlmyb46b and mlvnd <dig>  by contrast, mlgt43c-e were not transactivated by any effectors examined. these results indicate that mlgt43a and mlgt43b genes are differentially regulated by snd <dig>  myb <dig> and vnd <dig> orthologues and there probably exist other transcriptional factors regulating the expression of mlgt43c-e genes besides the above effectors examined.fig.  <dig> transactivation assay of the mlgt43a-e promoters by mlsnd <dig>  mlmyb46a/b or mlvnd <dig>  diagrams indicate the effector and reporter constructs used for transactivation analysis. the effector constructs contain the mlsnd <dig>  mlmyb46a, mlmyb46b or mlvnd <dig> cdna driven by the 35s promoter. the reporter constructs consist of the gus reporter gene driven by the mlgt43a-e promoters. transactivation ability was represented by the relative gus activities. the expression level of the gus reporter gene in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts transfected with no effector was used as a control and was set to 1



none of mlgt <dig> genes could rescue the mucilage defects of irx <dig> seeds
since irx <dig> has been shown to be responsible for the synthesis of xylan in seed coat mucilage and mutations in irx <dig> lead to a defect in mucilage cohesiveness property  <cit> , we sought to examine whether mlgt <dig> genes could rescue the mucilage defect of irx <dig>  the seeds of mlgt <dig> complemented lines in irx <dig> background were examined by ruthenium red staining . when seeds were imbibed in water and subjected to gentle shaking, the seeds of seven mlgt <dig> complemented irx <dig> lines all exhibited a thin layer of mucilage phenotype similar to that of the irx <dig> seeds. by contrast, the wt seeds have a much thicker mucilage layer tightly attached to the seed. this result indicated that none of mlgt <dig> genes could rescue the mucilage defect of irx <dig> 

we further determined the monosaccharide composition of seed mucilage for each complemented line. the xyl content was dramatically reduced in irx <dig> mucilage as previously reported  <cit> . not surprisingly, the xyl content in seven complemented lines was comparable to that of irx <dig> and not restored to the wt level , suggesting that none of mlgt43s could synthesize the xylan in the seed coat mucilage.

much progress has been gained in xylan biosynthesis mainly in the model species arabidopsis. several gt <dig> family proteins have been revealed to participate in xylan backbone biosynthesis in secondary cell walls . by contrast, less knowledge regarding the biosynthesis of xylan is known in grass, despite that xylan especially arabinoxylan is the major hemicellulosic components in grass cell walls. in this study, we identified seven gt <dig> genes from m. lutarioriparius and revealed that they are functional orthologues of arabidopsis irx <dig> and irx <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of gt <dig> proteins from nine representative plant species and miscanthus revealed that these proteins were classified into three major clades, namely irx <dig>  irx9l and irx14/irx14l . noteworthy, our results indicated that no irx <dig> orthologues were present in the lower plant species moss  and spikemoss . moss has been demonstrated to be capable of synthesizing glucuronoxylans that are structurally similar to those present in the secondary cell walls of higher plants  <cit> . the glucuronoxylans are mainly located in primary cell walls in moss as no mechanical supporting tissues composed mainly of secondary cell walls have been evolved. as a basal vascular plant, spikemoss has evolved tissues containing secondary cell walls. xylans have been shown to be one of the most abundant cell wall components in spikemoss  <cit> . since irx <dig> has been shown to be mainly responsible for the biosynthesis of xylans in secondary cell walls  <cit> , the absence of xylans in secondary cell walls in moss may partially explain why no irx <dig> orthologues are present in moss genome. thus, it seems likely that vascular plants have evolved a specialized isoform of irx <dig>  which is responsible for xylan biosynthesis in secondary cell walls. however, this hypothesis seems somewhat implausible because irx <dig> orthologues are also lacking in spikemoss. together, these results indicate that the specialization of irx <dig> for xylan biosynthesis in primary and secondary cell walls is not necessary for the evolution of vascular tissue.

although the qrt-pcr analysis revealed that mlgt43a to mlgt43e in m. lutarioriparius exhibited broad expression patterns across the tissues examined, the in situ hybridization analysis unambiguously indicated that miscanthus irx <dig> orthologues mlgt43a and mlgt43b were preferentially expressed in cells undergoing secondary wall thickening, while the irx9l orthologues mlgt43c-e were expressed in both parenchymal cells and sclerenchyma cells . in addition, irx <dig> orthologues mlgt43a and mlgt43b were both transcriptionally regulated by mlsnd <dig>  mlmyb46a or mlvnd <dig>  three candidate transcriptional switches governing secondary cell wall biosynthesis. by contrast, the miscanthus irx9l orthologues  were not significantly transactivated by these transcription factors . similar results were reported for irx <dig> orthologues in arabidopsis, rice  and poplar , which were shown to be highly expressed in tissues with abundant secondary cell walls  <cit> . in addition, poplar irx <dig> orthologues  were transcriptionally regulated by ptxtmyb <dig>  and pnac <dig> , master transcriptional switches involved in secondary cell wall formation  <cit> . together, these results indicated that irx <dig> orthologues are mainly involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis, and its roles are highly conserved in angiosperm species.

in addition, the number of gt <dig> proteins in monocot species seems to be higher than that of dicot species, which was mainly due to a significantly expansion of irx <dig> and irx9l members in monocot species . in dicots, such as arabidopsis and poplar, xylan is predominantly deposited in the secondary cell walls, whereas there is very limited amounts of xylan in the primary cell walls. by contrast, the monocot species including rice and miscanthus have abundant amounts of xylan in both primary and secondary cell walls. this could partially explain why the number of irx <dig> and irx9l orthologues are over-presented in monocots compared with dicots.

phylogenetic analysis also indicated that ancestral irx <dig> orthologues emerged after the specification of the higher plants . in addition, irx <dig> may possibly evolve from its irx9l homologue through the duplication events during the evolutionary process as they share very high sequence identities  <cit> . the functional diversification of irx <dig> orthologues may be due to their expression specificities and their abilities to respond to the key transcriptional factors involved in secondary wall formation . the different cis-regulatory elements present in the promoter of miscanthus irx <dig> and irx9l orthologues may explain their functional divergences to some extent . in other words, miscanthus irx <dig> orthologues may have evolved to gain some key cis-regulatory elements, which confers their specific functions in xylan biosynthesis during secondary cell wall formation.

in arabidopsis, irx <dig> and irx <dig> play independent roles in xylan biosynthesis, since the phenotypes of irx <dig> mutant cannot be rescued by the overexpression of irx <dig> or irx14l and vice versa  <cit> . in addition, irx <dig> and irx <dig> are proposed to play dominant roles, whereas their homologues irx9l and irx14l are indicated to play partially redundant or minor roles in xylan backbone biosynthesis  <cit> . contrary to this assumption, a recent study proposed that irx9l and irx14l play equally important roles with irx <dig> and irx <dig> in xylan biosynthesis  <cit> . the seven gt <dig> orthologues in miscanthus were classified into three major subclades namely irx <dig>  irx9l and irx14/irx14l. all five miscanthus irx <dig> and irx9l orthologues  could nearly fully or partially complement the phenotypes of irx <dig>  while none of these genes could rescue the phenotypes of irx <dig>  similarly, two miscanthus irx <dig> and irx14l orthologues  were able to rescue the phenotypes of irx <dig> but not irx <dig>  these results indicated that gt <dig> genes have been evolved into two functional groups in miscanthus, and the functions between the members in irx9/irx9l and irx14/irx14l groups have been diversified substantially. likewise, the involvement of two distinctly functional groups of gt <dig> genes in xylan biosynthesis seems to be highly conserved in different plant species. for example, the rice orthologues of irx <dig>  were able to rescue the phenotypes of irx <dig> but were not able to complement those of irx <dig>  by contrast, the irx <dig> orthologue osgt43j was able to complement the irx <dig> phenotypes but unable to rescue those of irx <dig>  similarly, the poplar irx <dig> orthologues  were able to rescue the xylan defects of irx <dig> but could not complement those of irx <dig>  whereas the irx <dig> orthologues  were capable of rescuing the defects of irx <dig> but not those of irx <dig> 

xylans are typically substituted with α-l-araf residues at c2- and/or c3-position in arabinoxylans  and less frequently with glcpa and/or 4-o-me-glcpa sidechains at c2- position in glucuronoarabinoxylans  in grasses  <cit> . ax is the major xylan in miscanthus and the degree of araf substitution positively affects the lignocellulose saccharification under various pretreatments  <cit> . ax is also the major xylan of the seed mucilage in psyllium   <cit> . during arabidopsis seed differentiation, the seed coat epidermal cells synthesize and secrete large amounts of mucilage, which encapsulated the seed upon imbibition. although the arabidopsis seed coat mucilage are primarily composed of pectic rg i, minor amounts of xylan are also present in the mucilage and play an important role in maintaining the structure of seed coat mucilage  <cit> . unlike the typical xylan in dicot secondary cell walls, mucilage xylan has a unique structure with frequent substitutions with xyl rather than with glca or ara residues  <cit> . irx <dig> has been revealed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of xylan in arabidopsis mucilage and loss function lead to a mucilage cohesiveness defect  <cit> . it is noteworthy that none of the mlgt <dig> genes could be able to complement the irx <dig> mucilage defect , suggesting that mlgt43s could not synthesize the mucilage xylan, which is involved in maintaining the structure of seed coat mucilage . the reason might due to the fact that mucilage xylan is structurally different from that of the stem secondary walls, and the functions of miscanthus gt <dig> proteins have diversified from those of arabidopsis orthologues during the evolutionary process. similarly, there is also lines of evidence highlighting that mucilage xylan biosynthesis is diversified in different plant species. for example, irx <dig> but not irx <dig> or irx <dig> might be responsible for the synthesis of the xylan backbone in psyllium mucilage because irx <dig> orthologues were highly presented in psyllium mucilage, while relatively very lower transcripts of irx <dig> and irx <dig> were detected in a transcriptome analysis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we functionally identified seven gt <dig> genes from m. lutarioriparius. our results provided the first line of genetic evidence demonstrating that miscanthus has evolved to retain two functionally non-redundant groups of gt <dig> genes involved in xylan biosynthesis. mlgt43a-e are functional orthologues of irx <dig>  while mlgt43f and mlgt43g are functional orthologues of irx <dig>  nevertheless, functional divergence of irx <dig> orthologues in m. lutarioriparius has occurred as none of mlgt <dig> genes could rescue the mucilage defects of irx <dig> seeds. furthermore, mlgt43a-e were differentially regulated by snd <dig>  myb <dig> or vnd <dig> orthologues, the putative key regulators in secondary cell wall formation. the results obtained deepen our understanding of xylan biosynthesis in miscanthus. understanding how xylan polymers are synthesized may lay a foundation for the genetic modification of miscanthus to be better suited for various economically important applications, including the more efficient utilization of xylan for biofuel production.
