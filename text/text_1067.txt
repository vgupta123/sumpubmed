BACKGROUND
microtubules  are highly conserved polarized cytoskeletal polymers that mediate cellular processes such as motility, cell division, polarity, intracellular transport, and signaling in eukaryotic cells. gtp-bound α/β-tubulin heterodimers are stacked in a head-to-tail fashion to form polar protofilaments, which associate laterally to form polar hollow mt cylinders with highly dynamic plus ends and more stable minus ends. the gtp bound to β-tubulin is hydrolyzed to gdp as mt assembly progresses. before hydrolysis takes place, the gtp-bound tubulin forms a cap that stabilizes the plus end of the mt and thereby promotes its growth. stochastic loss of the stabilizing cap renders the mt lattice of gdp-bound tubulin unstable and causes rapid mt depolymerization, a process known as catastrophe. when gtp-tubulin subunits reassemble at the depolymerizing plus end, the mt resumes growth, a process known as rescue. this mt behavior of alternating between catastrophe and rescue at the plus end is known as dynamic instability  <cit> .

gtp-tubulin dimers adopt a curved conformation in solution and are thought to assemble into outwardly curved sheets at the extreme plus end  <cit> . as the number of laterally associating protofilaments increases, the curved gtp-tubulin sheets gradually straighten, to form a tubular structure. gtp hydrolysis and subsequent phosphate release occur soon after tubulin incorporation into the protofilament, resulting in a short gtp cap  <cit> .

a subgroup of mt-associated proteins  is characterized by their ability to accumulate at mt ends  <cit> . plus-end tracking proteins  recognize and bind to the plus-ends of mts, and potentially modulate mt assembly dynamics and interactions between the mt plus ends and subcellular targets. two categories of + tips can be distinguished; whereas “autonomous tip trackers” bind mt ends independently of other maps, “hitchhikers” are targeted to the mt ends through binding to an autonomous tip tracker, and they often also have a considerable binding affinity for the mt lattice. end-binding proteins  are autonomous tip trackers that regulate + tip networks in animal cells by recruiting various hitchhiking + tips to the growing plus ends  <cit> . ebs bind in close proximity to the exchangeable gtp-binding site of tubulin, and are thought to sense the mt’s nucleotide state   <cit> . eb <dig> is probably associated with the gtp cap and gtp-like-tubulin, in which hydrolyzed gtp remains in an intermediate gdp-pi state  <cit> . ebs show a characteristic localization pattern at the growing mt ends; their abundance peaks at the mt tip regions and gradually declines toward the main body of mts, forming a “comet”-like pattern.

plants have two types of ebs that localize either to the cytoplasm or nucleus. in arabidopsis thaliana, cytoplasmic eb1a and eb1b and nuclear eb1c all accumulate at the growing plus ends of mts . knockdown or knockout of eb1c compromised the alignment of spindle and phragmoplast mts in arabidopsis root cells, and caused frequent lagging of separating chromosomes at anaphase in cultured nicotiana tabacum  cells  <cit> . however, arabidopsis mutants of eb1a and eb1b, as well as their double mutants, are almost indistinguishable from wild-type plants with respect to growth and morphology, indicating that ebs may not be important for mt functions in interphase plant cells  <cit> .

in addition to eb <dig>  several other plant maps show partial accumulation at the mt plus ends  <cit> . spiral <dig>  is a plant-specific protein that belongs to a six-member family with overlapping functions in arabidopsis . spr <dig> is localized to the mt lattice and also accumulates at the growing plus ends of mts in arabidopsis cells, forming an extended comet-like pattern that is much longer than that formed by eb <dig>  <cit> . the in vivo association of spr <dig> with cortical mts does not require eb <dig>  <cit> . it is not clear how spr <dig> associates with mts and how it is preferentially recruited to the plus ends, because spr <dig> is not recovered in map preparations from arabidopsis cell extracts  <cit>  and recombinant spr <dig> protein does not show mt binding in vitro  <cit> . the arabidopsis spr <dig> mutant shows right-handed helical growth of elongating axial organs  <cit> , and this helical phenotype is exaggerated in multiple mutants of the spr <dig> gene family  <cit> .

we previously isolated several novel maps from arabidopsis cultured cells  <cit> . among them, a putative map encoded by at3g <dig> was found to localize to cortical mts when transiently expressed as a gfp fusion in allium cepa  epidermal cells  <cit> . in arabidopsis, there is another homologue  of this putative map. we named this homologue gpt <dig>  and the formerly identified map  <cit>  gpt <dig>  the amino acid sequences of gpt <dig> and gpt <dig>  share  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity, and do not contain any defined domains with known functions. in this report, we demonstrate that these gpt proteins are novel plant-specific + tips that track growing mt plus ends independently of eb <dig> and spr <dig> 

RESULTS
mt-binding regions in gpt1/2
although gpt1/ <dig> do not exhibit any significant amino acid homology with functionally characterized proteins  <cit> , we noticed that the middle  and c-terminal  regions of these proteins are enriched in the basic amino acid residues arg, lys, and his . by contrast, the n-terminal  regions are abundant in acidic asp and glu . thus, gpts are polar proteins with short, negatively charged regions at their n-termini  and longer, positively charged regions in their middles and c-termini .fig.  <dig> the positively charged domains of gpt1/ <dig> bind mts in onion epidermal cells. full-length and truncated fragments of gpt1/ <dig> were fused to gfp at their c-termini, and transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. a and d charge plots of gpt <dig>  and gpt <dig> . b and e protein structures of gpt <dig>  and gpt <dig> . the positions of basic amino acid residues are indicated by blue lines. the n-terminal  regions are negatively charged, whereas the middle  and c-terminal  regions are positively charged. c and f localization of gfp-fused gpt fragments to cortical mts is indicated by ++ , + , +/- , and – . the numerator and denominator show the number of cells with positive localization patterns and the number of total cells that expressed gfp fusion proteins, respectively. the gpt2-gfp fusion  was co-expressed with tagrfp-map <dig> to visualize mts. left panels, gpt2-gfp; middle panels, tagrfp-map4; right panels, merged images. scale bars, 10 μm




to identify mt-binding regions in these proteins, we fused full-length and truncated versions of gpt <dig> and gpt <dig> to gfp, and transiently expressed these fusions in onion epidermal cells, together with the red fluorescent mt marker tagrfp-map <dig> . dual color visualization of gpt1-gfp and tagrfp-map <dig> proved difficult, possibly due to gpt <dig> having a weak mt-binding capacity, competition between gpt <dig> and map <dig> for overlapping mt binding sites, or both. therefore, the mt-binding capacity of gpt1-gfp was determined based on the presence of fine filaments . colocalization of the gfp and rfp signals confirmed that full-length gpt <dig> localized to cortical mts . the n-terminal  regions of gpt <dig>  and gpt <dig>  did not localize to mts, whereas the n-terminal-deleted   and the middle   fragments were clearly localized to cortical mts . the c-terminal  fragments  were somewhat associated with mts, but to a lesser extent than the fragments containing the m region. these results from transient expression assays indicate that the positively charged basic amino acid residues  mediate the binding of gpt1/ <dig> to mts in vivo.

mt co-sedimentation assay
to test whether gpt1/ <dig> directly bind to mts, we fused full-length gpt <dig> and gpt <dig> to maltose-binding protein , expressed the recombinant proteins in bacteria, and purified the proteins by affinity purification using amylose resins. some degradation occurred during the purification, particularly in the case of mbp-gpt <dig>  when 1 μm of purified proteins was incubated with mts assembled from bovine brain tubulin and pelleted by ultracentrifugation, intact mbp-gpt <dig> and mbp-gpt <dig> were identified in the microtubule pellet fraction  . the partial degradation products of mbp-gpt <dig>  were also pelleted, whereas further degraded mbp-gpt <dig> and mbp-gpt <dig> fragments were not. in the absence of mts, mbp-gpt <dig> and mbp-gpt <dig> remained in the supernatant . mbp alone was also evaluated to verify that it is not responsible for binding of gpt1/ <dig> to mts. as shown in fig.  <dig>  mbp remained in the supernatant fraction after ultracentrifugation. these results show that gpt1/ <dig> bind mts directly.fig.  <dig> recombinant gpt <dig> and gpt <dig> bind to mts in vitro.  purified mbp-fused gpt <dig> and gpt <dig> proteins were incubated with or without taxol-stabilized mts, pelleted by ultracentrifugation, and analyzed by sds-page and coomassie brilliant blue staining. the positions of full-length mbp-gpt <dig> and mbp-gpt <dig> are indicated by arrowheads, and the mt-binding partial degradation products of mbp-gpt <dig> are indicated with an asterisk. tubulin is also indicated. s, supernatant fraction; p, pellet fraction; and m, size markers.  quantitative analysis of the binding of mbp-gpt <dig> to mts. various concentrations of purified mbp-gpt <dig> was mixed with taxol-stabilized mts and then subjected to co-sedimentation analysis, as in a. assuming that there is one gpt <dig> binding site on the tubulin dimer, the binding equation  was fitted




to determine the stoichiometry and affinity of gpt toward mts, various amounts of mbp-gpt <dig> were centrifuged with a constant amount of mts that were polymerized from 1 μm tubulin heterodimer, and a binding curve was obtained . mbp-gpt <dig> bound to mts in a concentration-dependent manner and saturated at a stoichiometry of approximately  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  mol of gpt <dig> per mol of tubulin dimer. the dissociation constant kd was calculated to be  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  μm. however, if gpt <dig> associates with mts in more than one binding mode with different affinities , this simple regression analysis does not provide true binding values.

subcellular localization
to determine the subcellular localization of gtp1/ <dig> and to monitor their dynamics in vivo, gfp was fused to either the n-terminus or the c-terminus of gpt <dig> and expressed under the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter, because the 5′-regulatory region of gpt <dig> was recalcitrant to cloning, whereas gfp was fused to the c-terminus of gpt <dig> and expressed under its native promoter. both n-terminal and c-terminal gfp fusions of gpt <dig> localized to mts in transient expression assays using onion epidermal cells , indicating that the location of gfp does not affect the subcellular localization of fusion proteins. the arabidopsis mt marker line that expresses mcherry fluorescent protein fused to β-tubulin  <dig>  was used as a transformation host.

gfp-gpt <dig> and gtp2-gfp co-localized with mcherry-tub <dig> and decorated the nuclear envelope and preprophase bands, mitotic spindles, and phragmoplasts of the mitotic cells of the root meristem . gfp-gpt <dig> labeling differed slightly from mcherry-tub <dig> labeling, particularly in expanding phragmoplasts. this observation prompted us to carefully examine the localization and dynamics of gpt <dig> and gpt <dig> in cortical mt arrays, where the dynamics of single mts can be clearly visualized.fig.  <dig> gpt1/ <dig> decorate mitotic mt structures in arabidopsis root epidermal cells. gfp fusions  were expressed in transgenic arabidopsis plants harboring the mcherry-tub <dig> mt marker . epidermal cells in the cell division zone of the roots of seedlings were analyzed. dividing cells at preprophase, metaphase, anaphase, and cytokinesis are shown. a gfp-gpt <dig> was expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter. b gpt2-gfp was expressed under the control of the endogenous regulatory elements of gpt <dig>  scale bars, 5 μm




gpt <dig> and gpt <dig> are novel + tips
time-lapse imaging of root epidermal cells using a spinning disk confocal microscope revealed that gfp-gpt <dig> and gpt2-gfp not only decorated the mt lattice, but also accumulated as particles on mts . double intensity plots with mts  and gfp-labeled gpt1/ <dig> showed that gpt1/ <dig> are localized to the mt ends in a comet-like pattern, with the highest signal intensity at the mt ends and a gradual decline in signal further from the mt ends. this mt-end localization was more pronounced for gfp-gpt <dig> than for gpt2-gfp. the mt ends labeled with gfp were highly dynamic, indicating that gpt1/ <dig> both label the plus ends of cortical mts. gfp-gpt <dig> was associated with polymerizing plus ends, and dissociated as soon as catastrophe occurred . however, when the mts started to polymerize again, gfp-gpt <dig> was immediately recruited to the growing ends . gpt2-gfp showed a similar but weaker labeling pattern when compared with gfp-gpt <dig> . these results demonstrate that gpt <dig> and gpt <dig> preferentially recognize the plus ends of growing mts.fig.  <dig> gpt <dig> tracks the growing plus ends of cortical mts. a the subcellular localization of gfp-gpt <dig>  and mcherry-tub <dig>  which labels cortical mts , was analyzed in interphase cells of the arabidopsis root epidermis. scale bar, 5 μm. b average fluorescence intensity  profiles of gfp-gpt <dig> and mcherry-tub <dig> were obtained by analyzing and plotting data from  <dig> mt images. the data were normalized and the peak intensity of gfp-gpt <dig> was set to  <dig>  the error bars indicate sem. c representative time-lapse sequence and corresponding kymograph of a mt that underwent catastrophe at t = 14 s. gfp-gpt <dig> disappeared from the tip immediately after the mt began to depolymerize. dashed yellow arrows indicate the point at catastrophe occurred. scale bar,  <dig>  μm. d representative time-lapse sequence and corresponding kymograph of a mt that underwent rescue at t = 12 s. gfp-gpt <dig> localized to the tip immediately after mt growth resumed. dashed yellow arrows indicate the point at which rescue occurred. scale bar,  <dig>  μm

eb <dig> is a + tip family member that recognizes the gtp-cap region of growing mts  <cit> . to compare the labeling patterns of gpt1/ <dig> with that of eb <dig>  we stably co-expressed gfp-labeled gpt <dig> or  <dig> and mcherry-labeled arabidopsis eb1b  in arabidopsis plants. eb1-mcherry showed strong plus-end labeling, as previously reported . many, but not all, eb <dig> particles co-localized with gfp-gpt <dig> . when the relative fluorescent intensities of gfp and mcherry were plotted, the comet-shaped fluorescent signals of gfp-gpt <dig> and eb1-mcherry partially overlapped. in our confocal microscopy setup, the two emitted fluorescent signals from gfp and mcherry were sequentially detected after alternately exciting each fluorophore. when mcherry fluorescence was detected for  <dig>  s, followed by the detection of gfp signal for  <dig>  s, the highest gfp-gpt <dig> signal intensity was located approximately  <dig>  μm closer to the mt end when compared with the highest eb1-mcherry signal . when the detection order was reversed, however, the highest eb1-mcherry signal intensity was located approximately  <dig>  μm in front of the highest signal intensity of gfp-gpt <dig> . at the current spatial resolution, optical artifacts associated with our detection system make it difficult to conclusively determine whether eb <dig> and gpt <dig> completely co-localize at growing mt plus ends. in both observations, the fluorescent signal intensities of the eb <dig> comets decreased gradually and reached background levels at  <dig>  μm behind the tips. by contrast, substantial levels of gfp-gpt <dig> signal  remained associated with the mt lattice behind the comet tails.fig.  <dig> gpt <dig> and eb <dig> label similar regions of growing mt ends. a subcellular localization of gfp-gpt <dig>  and eb1-mcherry  was analyzed in interphase cells of the arabidopsis root epidermis. scale bar, 5 μm. b representative time-lapse sequences. left, mcherry signals were analyzed first, followed by gfp signals. right, gfp signals were analyzed first, followed by mcherry signals. scale bars,  <dig>  μm. c and d average fi profiles of gfp-gpt <dig> and eb1-mcherry were obtained by analyzing and plotting data from  <dig> mt images. the data were normalized and the peak intensities of gfp-gpt <dig> and eb1-mcherry were set to  <dig>  the error bars indicate sem. c mcherry signals were analyzed first, followed by gfp signals. d gfp signals were analyzed first, followed by mcherry signals

tip-tracking of gpt does not require eb <dig> or spr1
eb <dig> recognizes a structural feature of the mt gtp cap and directly binds to the plus ends of growing mts both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . many animal + tips do not bind directly to the mt plus ends in vivo, but are recruited to this region by eb <dig>  to test whether gpt accumulates at the mt plus end directly or through a hitchhiking mechanism involving interaction with eb <dig>  we analyzed the tip-tracking behavior of gpt in the arabidopsis eb <dig> null mutant. because the arabidopsis genome includes three eb <dig> genes that may function redundantly  <cit> , a triple eb <dig> knockout mutant was used to study the expression of gfp-gpt <dig> and gpt2-gfp. gpt1/ <dig> both localized to the plus ends of growing mts, in the same pattern as observed in the wild-type background .fig.  <dig> gpt <dig> does not require eb <dig> or spr <dig> to track the mt end. a and b gfp-gpt <dig> was expressed in the arabidopsis eb1a eb1b eb1c triple mutant. a the subcellular localization of gfp-gpt <dig> was analyzed in interphase cells of the arabidopsis root epidermis. scale bar, 5 μm. b an average fi profile of gfp-gpt <dig> was obtained by analyzing and plotting data from  <dig> mt images. the data were normalized and the peak intensity of gfp-gpt <dig> was set to  <dig>  the error bars indicate sem. c and d gfp-gpt <dig> was expressed in the spr <dig> mutant that also expressed mcherry-tub <dig> as a mt marker. c the subcellular localization of gfp-gpt <dig> and mcherry-tub <dig> was analyzed in interphase cells of the arabidopsis root epidermis. scale bar, 5 μm. d average fi profiles of gfp-gpt <dig> and mcherry-tub <dig> were obtained by analyzing and plotting data from  <dig> mt images. the data were normalized and the peak intensity of gfp-gpt <dig> was set to  <dig>  the error bars indicate sem

spr <dig> and its homologues are plant-specific mt-localized proteins that bind to both the growing plus ends and the mt lattice  <cit> . arabidopsis contains seven spr <dig> homologues that may be redundant, and spr <dig> contributes predominantly to the anisotropic growth of seedling roots  <cit> . therefore, we used a spr <dig> null mutant to test whether spr <dig> is required for the plus-end tracking behavior of gpt. cortical mts were labeled with mcherry-tub <dig>  in the spr <dig> mutant, gpt1/ <dig> labeled growing mt plus ends in interphase epidermal cells, forming a comet-like pattern . the tip-tracking behavior of the gfp-labeled gpts in the spr <dig> null mutant was indistinguishable from that in wild-type epidermal cells.

these results demonstrate that eb <dig> and spr <dig> are not required for the mt plus-end tracking function of gpt <dig> and gpt <dig> 

discussion
gpt1/ <dig> bind to mts through its basic regions
with the exception of the n-terminal regions, gpt1/ <dig> are relatively rich in lys, arg, and his residues, with gpt1/ <dig> having average pi values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these positively charged residues are distinct biochemical features of gpts; however, these values are lower than those of the highly basic domains of some maps, such as bpp <dig>  bpp <dig>  and bpp <dig>  which have pi values of  <dig> – <dig>   <cit> . transient expression of gfp-tagged full-length and truncated gpt1/ <dig> proteins in onion epidermal cells showed that the basic regions of gpt1/ <dig> are responsible for the in vivo localization to cortical mts. the central and c-terminal basic regions were independently targeted to mts in vivo, suggesting that several mt-binding regions exist in gpt1/ <dig>  because recombinant gpt1/ <dig> proteins bind to mts in vitro, the basic regions appear to bind mts directly.

various mt-binding regions have been identified in maps, and a high pi value resulting from basic amino acid residues was found to be characteristic of the mt-binding regions of certain maps  <cit> . the positively charged regions are thought to interact electrostatically with the highly acidic glu- and asp-rich c-terminal tails of α- and β-tubulins. because an acidic c-terminus is a common feature of all eukaryotic tubulins  <cit> , this charge-based mt-binding mode is frequently used by maps in various organisms.

gpt preferentially accumulates at the plus ends of growing mts
gfp-tagged gpt not only labels the mt lattice, but is considerably enriched at the growing plus ends of cortical mts. this plus-end localization is stronger for gfp-gpt <dig> than for gpt2-gfp. we do not know whether the affinity for the plus end is inherently different between gpt1/ <dig>  or whether the location of the fused gfp molecule influenced the biochemical properties of gpt1/ <dig>  although gpt1/ <dig> have highly similar distributions of basic amino acids and considerable levels of amino acid sequence identity, we noticed that gpt1-gfp associates less efficiently with mts than does gpt2-gfp when a mt marker is co-expressed in onion epidermal cells. further biochemical analyses are required to identify possible differences between mt plus-end targeting by gpt1/ <dig> 

the tip-tracking behavior of gpt1/ <dig> and the canonical + tip, arabidopsis eb <dig>  was compared by coexpressing these proteins tagged with different fluorescent markers in arabidopsis plants. eb <dig> specifically recognized the growing mt plus end and dissociated almost completely at  <dig>  μm from the mt tip, where there are no binding sites for eb <dig> . by contrast, the gpt1/ <dig> tip-tracking fluorescent signal decreased with increasing distance from the mt plus end, but a substantial proportion of gpt1/ <dig> molecules remained bound to the gdp-tubulin mt lattice. this propensity of gpt1/ <dig> to bind to the mt lattice may obstruct observations of tip-localized gpt1/ <dig> in dense mitotic mt arrays. although further analysis at higher resolution is necessary, our present localization data suggest that eb <dig> and gpt <dig> have distinct binding sites at growing mt plus ends. eb <dig> recognizes the terminal gtp-cap and an extended region of several hundreds of tubulin molecules at growing mt ends  <cit> . recent imaging of eb <dig> localization using cryo-electron tomography showed that eb <dig> interacts with outwardly curved and straight regions of the mt lattice that probably represent gtp- and gdp-pi-tubulin dimers, respectively, at the mt ends  <cit> . ebs bind at the intersection of four tubulin dimers in two adjacent protofilaments  <cit> . this binding site is ideally suited for sensing the nucleotide states of the surrounding tubulin dimers. to autonomously track the growing mt ends, a + tip should recognize subtle structural changes of tubulins that are associated with the nucleotide status and the protofilament closure into a cylinder. the predicted gpt-binding sites at the acidic tubulin c-terminus would be insufficient for such a recognition mechanism, and may require other components that associate with mts, such as the n-terminal non-basic regions.

the efficient dissociation of eb <dig> from the mt lattice is partly caused by the negatively charged c-terminus of eb <dig>  when this c-terminus was replaced with a neutrally charged motif, the eb <dig> mutant decorated the mt lattice without affecting its interaction with the growing mt ends  <cit> . the biochemical properties of gpt1/ <dig> may render these molecules less able than eb <dig> to discriminate between mt ends and the lattice.

eb <dig> is not the only + tip that autonomously interacts with the mt ends. xenopus laevis xmap <dig>  recognizes mt plus ends, but does not distinguish between polymerizing and depolymerizing ends  <cit> . xmap215/ch-tog binds to the extreme mt tip, whereas eb <dig> localizes to the tip region several tens of nanometers behind xmap215/ch-tog in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . +tips that recognize distinct structural features at the plus ends would be expected to decorate different sub-regions at the mt ends.

gpt does not require eb <dig> or spr <dig> for tip tracking
eb <dig> recruits non-autonomous + tips via their c-terminal eb homology domain to growing mt ends  <cit> . cap-gly domains  <cit>  and sxip motifs  <cit>  have been identified in eb1-interacting proteins that accumulate at growing mt ends. interestingly, gpt1/ <dig> still tracked the mt ends in the arabidopsis eb <dig> triple mutant background, which lacked eb <dig> function. the absence of cap-gly domains and sxip motifs in gpts suggests that their subcellular localization is independent of eb <dig>  gpt1/ <dig> localization to mt ends also does not require spr <dig>  another plant-specific + tip  <cit> . although it is not known whether spr <dig> autonomously tracks growing mt ends, these results suggest that if gpt does indeed use a hitchhiking mechanism to bind to a growing mt tip, it must couple with a + tip protein other than eb <dig> or spr <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
arabidopsis maps, gpt <dig> and gpt <dig>  robustly track the plus end of growing mts, independently of eb <dig> and spr <dig>  and thus define a novel plant-specific + tip family.
