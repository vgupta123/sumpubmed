BACKGROUND
lipids are hydrophobic molecules with thousands of species including fatty acids and fatty acids derivates, e.g., triglycerides, phospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols, and the like. generally, lipids function as energy storage, components of biological membrane, and signaling molecules, and likewise play a variety of biological roles in almost all aspects of life: growth, development, reproduction, stresses resistance, aging and longevity, etc.  <cit> . accordingly, the homeostasis of lipid metabolism must be tightly regulated. misregulation of lipid metabolism is often associated with many human diseases, particularly metabolic diseases, such as obesity, type  <dig> diabetes , cardiovascular diseases , and non-alcoholic fatty liver   <cit> , all of which are increasingly prevalent both in both developed and developing countries, such as china  <cit> .

previous studies have illustrated that the human systems which control appetite, energy partitioning, and the integration of lipid metabolic processes are highly complex and redundant  <cit> . therefore, employing animal models is indispensable in further understanding the lipid metabolism and lipid metabolic diseases. in some situations, lower and less complex organisms are particularly useful in providing simpler and clearer views of the fundamental regulation of lipid metabolism as opposed to higher, more complex organisms. chiefly due to the advantages of rapid generation time over the last decade, easy genetic manipulation and visualization of lipid droplets at whole animal level has made the tiny nematode, c. elegans an emerging model for exploring the biological functions of lipids and the genetic basis of fat storage regulation. to date, research on this organism has uncovered numerous findings in lipids metabolism and the associated fundamental regulatory mechanisms  <cit> , thereby prompting further exploration of its utility as an animal model in these types of studies.

as the first multicellular organism to have its genome completely sequenced  <cit>  and further deeply analyzed  <cit> c. elegans possesses for biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids  <cit> , mono-methyl branched fatty acids  <cit> , ceramides  <cit> , phospholipids  <cit> , and also the encoding of many lipid binding proteins and transporters  <cit> . this organism, however, lacks some key genes involved in the biosynthesis of sterol, forcing the worm to obtain it from its diet  <cit> . to date, however, how many potential lipid metabolic genes and pathways do exist in the c. elegans genome is not known. likewise and more importantly for its application as an animal model, the genomic and functional conservation of lipid metabolism from c. elegans to humans is unclear, limiting c. elegansâ€™ utility for in depth exploration of the fundamental mechanisms of lipid metabolism and human metabolic diseases.

in the present study, we analyzed genes involved in lipid metabolism in the c. elegans genome by comparative genomics. we first constructed a database containing  <dig> lipid metabolic genes from the c. elegans genome, and further assigned most of these into different lipid metabolic pathways. afterward, we systematically compared these genes in the human, drosophila, mouse, and rat genomes. ultimately, we took the advantage of rna-mediated interference  to disrupt the expression of most lipid metabolic genes, allowing us to explore the biological roles these play in c. elegans.

RESULTS
database construction of c. elegans lipid metabolic genes
to date, the kegg database  has collected  <dig> lipid metabolic genes from the c. elegans genome; this may be far from a complete listing, given the diversity and complexity of lipids in any organism. to garner a full list of lipid metabolic genes from the c. elegans genome, we retrieved lipid metabolic genes by manually searching the wormbase website  and published papers collected from ncbi pubmed, as well as the c. elegans orthologs of  <dig> human lipid metabolic genes and  <dig> lipid genes from the kegg database  <cit> . eventually,  <dig> lipid metabolic genes were retrieved from the c. elegans genome including  <dig> orthologs of human lipid metabolic genes and  <dig> genes collected from the literature and wormbase . in doing so, we constructed the first complete database of lipid metabolic genes of c. elegans, covering most potential lipid metabolic genes that could be found out in c. elegans genome at present .

the biochemical function of the  <dig> lipid metabolic genes was further annotated with ensembl biomart , though the  <dig> human orthologs and  <dig> lipid genes from kegg were already annotated . all  <dig> genes were also checked again in wormbase . fuxrthermore, the function annotation obtained from cluego  <cit>  showed that  <dig> lipid genes in c. elegans were not only involved in distinct lipid metabolic processes, but also play multiple roles in response to oxidative stress, aging and longevity, as well as other biological processes .

most of the  <dig> lipid genes in this database are predicted to encode specific enzymes that play roles in defined reactions, though experimental biochemical evidences for this conclusion may be lacking. some genes predicted to encode the same or similar enzymes were classified into a family. however, they may actually have same, distinct, or no biological conversion/function, as well as may involve into one or more reactions . for example,  <dig> fatty acid desaturase genes were present in the c. elegans genome, but they display completely different preference of substrates except fat- <dig> and fat- <dig> <cit> . cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are a superfamily of haem-containing mono-oxygenases with extraordinary diversity in their biochemical function across all kingdoms of life. within the c. elegans genome,  <dig> full length cytochrome p <dig>  genes have been found, but the exact biological functions of the vast majority of cyps are largely unknown as of yet  <cit> . only  <dig> of the  <dig> cyps may play a role in lipid metabolism, based on our findings from kegg, wormbase, and the published literature. another super family is lipase, consisting of  <dig> genes , which may encode hormone-sensitive lipase, phospholipase a <dig>  b <dig>  c, d, triacylglycerol lipase, or unknown lipase .

 <dig> genes potentially involved in  <dig> lipid metabolic pathways in c. elegans
totally,  <dig> c. elegans lipid genes from the kegg database were assigned into  <dig> lipid metabolic pathways: fatty acid biosynthesis , fatty acid elongation in mitochondria , fatty acid metabolism , synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies , steroid biosynthesis , glycerolipid metabolism , primary bile acid biosynthesis , steroid hormone biosynthesis , glycerophospholipid metabolism , ether lipid metabolism , sphingolipid metabolism , arachidonic acid metabolism , linoleic acid metabolism , alpha-linolenic acid metabolism , and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids . to clearly distinguish the fatty acid elongation in the cytoplasmic compartment from that in the mitochondria compartment , we renamed this pathway as fatty acid elongation . collectively, we built  <dig> lipid metabolic pathways in c. elegans .

to gain a clearer picture of lipid metabolic pathways in c. elegans, all  <dig> pathways were further integrated into a lipid metabolism network . additionally,  <dig> lipid genes including  <dig> human orthologs and  <dig> genes reported in the literature were assigned into the  <dig> pathways based on their annotated or reported biological function . however, due to a lack of both clear evidence of the precise biological function and detailed information, some genes could not be assigned into any pathway, even though their paralogs were assigned in the same pathway. subsequently, we constructed the first lipid metabolism network with  <dig> pathways containing  <dig> lipid genes from c. elegans .

only  <dig> of the  <dig> cyps could be assigned into different lipid metabolic pathways . based on kegg annotation, cyp-33e <dig> may function in fatty acid metabolism, though it was reported to be involved in the biosynthesis of eicosanoides derived from eicosapentaenoic acid   <cit> . therefore, we reassigned cyp-33e <dig> into the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway . despite cyp-35b <dig> being shown as a target of insulin/igf-i-like signaling   <cit> , and cyp-31a <dig> and cyp-31a <dig> being involved in the production of lipids required for eggshell formation  <cit> , their real catalyzing reactions were unclear enough that they could not be assigned into any lipid metabolic pathway.

genomic comparison of lipid metabolic genes among humans, mice, rats, drosophila, and c. elegans
research on animal models has brought numerous powerful and valuable insights to both basic human biology and disease pathology  <cit> . however, under many circumstances, animal models fall short of our expectations, going so far as to result in contradictory or opposite findings. these discrepancies may be due in part to the changes in the conservation of genetically controlled pathways from human to model animals  <cit> . this reality spurred us to inquire about the conservation of lipid metabolism that exists between c. elegans and humans, as well as mice  <cit> , rats  <cit> , and drosophila <cit> , all of which are commonly used as models to understand the mechanisms and potential therapies for human metabolic diseases.

all  <dig> c. elegans lipid genes were used to search for orthologs in the human, mouse, rat and drosophila genomes using ensembl biomart . eventually,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> lipid genes respectively were obtained in the human, mouse, rat, and drosophila genomes . comparison of these lipid genes revealed that  <dig> genes are conserved in all five organisms. over 70% of c. elegans lipid genes have orthologs in humans, mice, and rats . conversely,  <dig> %  human lipid genes are conserved in c. elegans , suggesting a high conservation of lipid metabolism genes between c. elegans and humans, as well as between c. elegans and both mice and rats.

conservation of c. elegans lipid metabolic genes in human disease
an imbalance of major lipid signaling pathways has previously been implicated in obesity, type  <dig> diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, etc.  <cit> . to analyze the relationship between lipid genes and human metabolic diseases, human disease genes were retrieved from the omim database . at present, the omim database has collected  <dig>  mim ids including genes, phenotypes, and locus which we downloaded from the newly updated ncbi ftp. using ensembl biomart id mapping, we found  <dig>  genes that could be considered human disease genes. comparison between humans and the other four organisms revealed that mice, rats, c. elegans, and drosophila have  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respective orthologs, in which  <dig> genes are conserved in all five organisms . furthermore,  <dig> of these  <dig> genes may be considered metabolic disease genes that were filtered within the database by keywords â€˜obesity, diabetes, metabolic disease, and others major obesity related diseasesâ€™. similarly,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> orthologs of human metabolic disease genes could be found among mouse, rat, c. elegans, and drosophila, respectively, in which  <dig> orthologous genes are conserved in all five organisms .

in humans,  <dig> of the  <dig> lipid genes are overlapped with metabolic disease genes . similarly,  <dig> of the  <dig> c. elegans lipid genes are orthologs of human metabolic disease genes . crucially, all  <dig> c. elegans lipid genes associated with metabolic diseases are completely overlapped with  <dig> human metabolic disease genes. in mice, rats, and drosophila, respectively there are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> lipid genes associated with metabolic diseases, with  <dig> genes conserved across all five species . moreover,  <dig> of the  <dig> lipid metabolism genes in c. elegans are also orthologs of human disease genes , implying that great number of lipid genes are also involved in other disease processes aside from metabolic syndrome.

investigated of the biological functions of lipid metabolic genes in c. elegans by rnai
among the  <dig> c. elegans lipid metabolic genes, only a small number have been biochemically and functionally characterized, demonstration that they participate into growth, development, dauer formation, aging and longevity, stress responses, and the like. however, the biological functions of most lipid metabolic genes remain unknown. the current argilent c. elegans rnai library covers about 86% of the known and predicted genes, providing a powerful tool to further investigate the biological functions of the lipid genes. we opted to take advantage of rna-mediated interference  to disrupt the expression of each lipid gene and investigate easily visible phenotypes including growth, sterility, and fat storage, indicated by nile red staining of fixation  <cit> .

of the  <dig> lipid genes in c. elegans,  <dig> have available rnai strains. of those with available strains, rnai knockdown of  <dig> genes consistently displayed remarkable phenotypes with significantly altered fat storage, growth defect, lethal, or sterility , while <dig> of these  <dig> genes significantly affect fat storage. inactivation of sams- <dig>  mboa- <dig>  and c05d <dig>  led to large lipid droplet size . sams- <dig> encodes s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  involved in the biosynthesis of phosphocholine . mutation of sams- <dig> displayed large size of lipid droplets  <cit> . mboa- <dig> encodes a member of the membrane-bound o-acyltransferase family, and is required for incorporation of pufas into phosphatidylinositol    <cit> . c05d <dig>  is an ortholog of the human patatin-like phospholipase  gene family, catalyzing the hydrolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue. let- <dig> has been reported to be a major 3-ketoacyl-coa reductase required for the production of monomethyl branched and long chain fatty acids  <cit> . dhs- <dig> is a novel 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase regulating the production of dafachronic acids   <cit> . in c. elegans, rnai knockdown of dsh- <dig> and let- <dig> slightly but obviously increased the size of lipid droplets .

rnai inactivation of lpin- <dig>  sptl- <dig>  acs- <dig>  cyp-29a <dig> and fat- <dig>  meanwhile, resulted in significantly decreased fat storage and a smaller size of lipid droplets. additionally, inactivation of  <dig> genes led to slower growth . pod- <dig> and fasn- <dig> encode acetyl-coa carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, respectively, and are predicted to catalyze the first and second step in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis . disruption of either of these two key genes by rnai definitely led to both lethality and larval arrest . meanwhile, inactivation of  <dig> other genes resulted in an egg laying variant .

discussion
understanding the lipid metabolism pathways and the involved genes is critical to further study of the biological functions of lipids and the mechanisms of metabolic diseases. a well-known animal model with a sequenced genome, like c. elegans, can provide a systemic genomic review for the whole lipid metabolism network. several research groups have bioinformatically or functionally characterized one or several lipid metabolism pathways in c. elegans <cit> . in our study, we created a database of  <dig> c. elegans lipid metabolism genes retrieved from the kegg data, wormbase, and the published literature . according to their annotation and real biological functions, these  <dig> genes could be designed into  <dig> lipid metabolism pathways integrated into a network . to our knowledge, ours is the first study to systematically analyze the lipid genes, metabolism pathways, and their biological functions in the animal model c. elegans.

remarkably, aside from the  <dig> c. elegans lipid genes, we additionally found  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respective lipid genes in the human, mouse, rat, and drosophila genomes. comparison of these genes revealed that  <dig> lipid genes are conserved in all five species. as such, this work provides useful information regarding lipid metabolism that will aid research utilizing c. elegans and other organisms as animal models. among the  <dig> c. elegans lipid genes,  <dig>  have orthologs in humans. conversely,  <dig> of the  <dig>  human lipid genes had orthologs in c. elegans. notably, of  <dig> human lipid genes related to metabolic diseases,  <dig> have orthologs in c. elegans and  <dig> genes are conserved in the human, mouse, rate, c. elegans and drosophila genomes, suggesting that lipid genes involved into metabolic diseases are highly conserved among model organisms. altogether, these results indicate that c. elegans and humans share high conservation in terms of lipid genes and their roles in metabolic diseases, suggesting that c. elegans is likely a useful and insightful model for use not only in research on the fundamental biology of lipid metabolism, but also exploring the mechanisms of human metabolic diseases.

the c. elegans rnai library provides numerous benefits to investigate the role of a specific gene. we thus systematically analyzed the biological functions of lipid genes with available rnai strains. among  <dig> lipid genes, nearly 40% genes were reported to affect phenotypes , e.g. fat content, dauer, lifespan, brood size, growth, etc. in this study, we only focused on the clearly observable phenotypes of growth, sterility, and fat storage. however, due to the rnai variation and gene redundancy of a family , rnai of many of the lipid genes displayed inconsistent, weak phenotypes that we excluded from this report. consistently, however, inactivation of  <dig> lipid genes by rnai remarkably affects worm fat metabolism, development, and other phenotypes. of these  <dig> lipid genes,  <dig> genes t19b <dig>  , t27f <dig> , k12h <dig> , f25b <dig>  , f56d <dig>   and d <dig>   have not been reported in literature . remarkbly,  <dig> out of  <dig> lipid genes , are fairly conserved in humans and c. elegans. moreover, c05d <dig> , fat- <dig>  dhs- <dig>  fasn- <dig>  pod- <dig>  elo- <dig>  and lpin- <dig> have relationships with human metabolic diseases.

c. elegans lpin- <dig> encodes a putative phosphatidic acid phosphatase orthologous to human lpin <dig> , lpin <dig> , and lpin <dig>  . in humans and mice, lpin- <dig> is associated with metabolic syndrome and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit>  and mutations in human lpin <dig> cause majeed syndrome  <cit> . c. elegans lpin- <dig> has been implicated in affecting fat storage and the breakdown and assembly of the nuclear envelope  <cit> . consistent with the mammalian lpin <dig> mutation, inactivation of c. elegans lpin- <dig> by rnai displayed resulted in low fat with small size of lipid droplets, as indicted by nile red staining . human patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing  <dig>  is associated with increased liver fat content and liver injury  <cit> . the c. elegans genome contains at least  <dig> orthologs of the patatin-like phospholipase . interestingly, rnai of c05d <dig> , an ortholog of pnpla <dig> that was considered to encode adipose triglyceride lipase  in c. elegans <cit> , led to higher fat and larger lipid droplets compared with the control in c. elegans , similar to other reports on humans and rodents  <cit> .

although mboa- <dig> affects pufa incorporation into pi  <cit> , dhs- <dig> regulates dafachronic acids metabolism  <cit> , and sptl- <dig> is involved in the biosynthesis of ceramide  <cit> , they have not been previously implicated in fat storage. rnai inactivation of mboa- <dig> and dhs- <dig> displayed increased lipid droplets size , whereas rnai inactivation of sptl-1decreased lipid droplet size. the fat content of all three genes should likewise be measured by other methods ) in future studies. acs- <dig> affects the incorporation of monomethyl branched chain fatty acid  into phospholipids  <cit>  and was reported to increase fat mass  <cit> . rnai of acs- <dig>  however, indeed decreased the density and size of lipid droplet . inactivation of let- <dig> by rnai led to slower growth , but once the worms reached the late l <dig> or early young adult stage, they had increased lipid droplets size . additionally, rnai of k12h <dig> , kat- <dig>  and f25b <dig>  resulted in slower growth , but fat storage looked normal once the worm entered into late l <dig> or early young adulthood. several members of cytochrome p <dig> superfamily were reported to functionally affect lipid metabolism  <cit> . we only found that rnai of cyp-29a <dig> significantly decreased fat storage with small lipid droplets as compared with the control . consequently, these lipid genes should potentially be considered as a starting point to further investigate their role in the regulation of fat storage.

CONCLUSIONS
we created a database of  <dig> c. elegans lipid metabolism genes that could be designed into  <dig> lipid metabolism pathways integrated into a network. additionally,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respective lipid genes in the human, mouse, rat, and drosophila genomes were also retrieved. over 70% of c. elegans lipid genes have human orthologs, with  <dig> of  <dig> c. elegans lipid genes being conserved in humans, mice, rats, and drosophila, of which  <dig> genes are specifically related to human metabolic diseases. furthermore, rna-mediated interference  of  <dig> lipid genes affects fat storage, development, and reproduction. this study provides the first genomic view on lipid metabolism in c. elegans, supporting the use of c. elegans as an increasingly prominent model in the study of metabolic diseases.
