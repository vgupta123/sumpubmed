BACKGROUND
pseudomonas putida is a ubiquitous gram-negative, saprophytic bacterium belonging to the gamma class of the proteobacteria. endowed with a remarkable environmental adaptability, p. putida strain f <dig>  <cit> , for example, has been investigated most extensively as a model organism for the microbial degradation of such xenobiotic aromatic compounds as toluene, benzene, and ethylbenzene  <cit> . considerably less scientific focus has been devoted to elucidating the molecular basis of heavy metal resistance functions exhibited by p. putida strains. genomic analysis of p. putida strain kt <dig> revealed an unexpectedly large repertoire of genes predicted to be involved in metal homeostasis, tolerance, and resistance, inferring that the organism is habituated to heavy metal exposure in its environment  <cit> . p. putida strains, for instance, have been isolated from the effluent of previously operated mercury-reducing bioreactors  <cit> , and pseudomonas spp. were reported to be dominant members of heavy metal-contaminated u.s. department of energy  sites, including a subsurface paleosol microbial community  <cit>  and uranium-contaminated groundwater environment  <cit> .

hexavalent chromium , in the form of chromate  or dichromate , is a widely distributed environmental contaminant due to its prevalent use in industrial and military defense applications  <cit> . microbially mediated reduction of soluble, toxic cr to sparingly soluble, less toxic cr is a potentially promising strategy for the in situ remediation of cr-contaminated subsurface environments. priester et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that unsaturated biofilms of p. putida strain mt- <dig> on membranes overlaying iron-deficient solid media either containing dichromate or solid dichromate-coated hematite were able to completely reduce cr under both conditions. additionally, efficient and rapid reduction of cr to cr has been measured for a soluble flavoprotein  purified and kinetically characterized from p. putida mk <dig>  <cit>  and for soluble crude fractions prepared from p. putida prs <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that p. putida, if present in the indigenous microbial community, is likely an important contributor to the bioreduction of chromate in polluted soil environments. surprisingly, there is a paucity of information on the physiological and global molecular response of p. putida to exogenous metals such as chromate, despite the fact that this soil bacterium has been used as a model organism for vadose zone bioremediation in various studies  <cit> . the availability of the genome sequences for p. putida strains f <dig>  and kt <dig>  <cit>  provides an opportunity to access its metabolic versatility and explore the molecular basis for its enhanced ability to adapt to the various environmental conditions present in pristine and metal-contaminated soils.

here we define the growth sensitivity of p. putida f <dig> to chromate when cultivated in complex  medium compared to defined minimal medium containing three different single carbon and energy sources . using a liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry-based "bottom-up" proteomic approach, we analyzed the global proteome profiles of f <dig> in an attempt to provide insight into the molecular systems underlying the cellular stress response to an acute exposure of chromate. in general, the chromate-perturbed f <dig> proteome was markedly different depending on whether challenged cells were cultivated in lb broth or minimal medium with lactate as the single carbon substrate. a core protein response to chromate, irrespective of the nutritional environment tested, is described and may provide potential in situ biomarkers for environmental biomonitoring of heavy metal stress in natural microbial communities.

RESULTS
impact of nutritional environment on p. putida growth and cr reduction
to assess the physiological impact of nutrient conditions on p. putida f <dig> sensitivity to cr, we determined the minimal inhibitory concentrations  of chromate for f <dig> in lb and m <dig> minimal media supplemented with  <dig> mm glucose ,  <dig> mm sodium lactate , or  <dig> mm sodium acetate  as the sole carbon source in the presence of k2cro <dig> at concentrations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> mm. f <dig> cells exhibited markedly different tolerance responses to chromate depending on the nutritional environment. the mic of cr for lb-propagated f <dig> cells was > <dig> mm , an approximately 40-fold greater concentration than that observed for f <dig> cells grown in m <dig> media irrespective of carbon source  . among the different minimal media, the nature of the carbon source influenced the growth ability of f <dig> in the presence of chromate. higher ods were measured for m9g in the absence of and at the lowest cr concentration  tested than for m9l and m9a. as cr concentrations were increased, however, m9l supported growth to higher cell densities than either m9g or m9a, and at the highest levels of chromate tested,  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, cell densities in m9l surpassed those in m9g by 3- and 9-fold, respectively . thus, there was a carbon-source-dependent hierarchy in chromate-amended m <dig> media  that cannot be explained simply on the basis of better growth medium energetics since glucose supported higher cell densities than lactate in the absence of cr, yet as cr levels increased lactate supported higher cell densities than glucose. therefore, m9l was chosen as the minimal medium for subsequent growth studies.

to determine whether f <dig> is capable of chromate reduction, cells were grown in lb broth containing k2cro <dig> and chromate reduction was measured for up to  <dig>  h. f <dig> reduced  <dig>  mm cr to  <dig>  mm or less within  <dig> h . the ability of f <dig> to carry out this reduction was largely independent of the initial cell density of the culture as evidenced by the fact that both a culture grown to mid-log phase  prior to chromate exposure and a newly inoculated culture  both reduced chromate to similar final concentrations . in addition, we tested reduction ability at  <dig> mm chromate by mid-log cells and found that there was no reduction within the first  <dig> min ; furthermore, at this higher initial concentration there was less reduction over a  <dig> h period .

a chromate level of  <dig> mm was selected for challenging mid-log-phase lb- and m9l-grown cells, because it represented the lowest concentration tested for which cell toxicity was observed under lb conditions. because we were interested in delineating the early molecular response to cr exposure, the 75-min time interval following chromate exposure was selected for harvest and analysis of f <dig> proteomes. figure  <dig> shows the growth differences between the cr-treated and untreated cultures for the two different nutrient conditions at the collection time interval  for shotgun proteomics analysis. the effect of cr addition was greater on m9l cells, which showed a ~34% reduction in cell density at the harvest point, while the growth difference between cr-treated and untreated control cells in lb liquid media was ~10%. no measurable cr reduction by f <dig> was detected under either growth condition within the 75-min period of exposure, although this strain of p. putida was shown to reduce  <dig>  mm chromate to ~ <dig> mm over  <dig> h .

global analysis of p. putida f <dig> proteomes under different growth conditions
protein abundance measurements were compared for cr-challenged and untreated p. putida f <dig> cells grown aerobically in either complex  medium or defined minimal  medium containing lactate as the sole carbon/energy source in order to assess growth condition-dependent differences in the molecular response to acute chromate exposure as well as proteomic signatures indicative of heavy metal stress irrespective of the nutritional milieu. in general, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  functionally diverse, non-redundant proteins out of  <dig> predicted proteins were detected in p. putida f <dig> cultivated in lb or m9l media, respectively, with and without chromate. by pooling all of the non-redundant proteins across both minimal and lb media samples, a total of  <dig>  proteins were detected, which is ~50% of the predicted proteome just from these four growth conditions. the entire list of identified proteins with their spectral counts and associated statistical analyses can be found in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig> proteins were found in all growth states and technical replicates . further analysis indicated that  <dig> proteins were exclusively expressed in lb-grown cell samples, while  <dig> proteins were unique to m9l-grown cells .

statistically significant proteins, i.e., those exhibiting at least a two-fold change in expression and an fdr <  <dig> , in lb- and m9l-cultivated control cells had a broad functional distribution . not unexpectedly, control cells propagated in m9l medium, which is much less nutritionally robust than lb, showed a much higher proportion of protein expression in the cog categories of cell wall membrane and envelope biogenesis , amino acid transport and metabolism , and energy production and conversion  . enzymes and transport proteins, specifically d-lactate dehydrogenase  and l-lactate transporter , related to lactate utilization were only identified in cell samples grown with this carbon source , which was a mixture of the d and l stereoisomers. lactate is converted to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase and then is further metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid  cycle. in addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase , involved in catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-coa and co <dig>  and two other enzymes of the tca cycle, nadp-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase  and malate dehydrogenase , had substantially decreased abundance levels under chromate conditions in m9l medium. the reduced synthesis of these key primary metabolic enzymes is consistent with the more severe cr-induced growth defects observed for f <dig> cells in m9l media .

hypothetical proteins  and poorly characterized proteins  constituted the largest proportion of the two control proteome datasets, with 31% for the lb samples and 32% for the m9l samples . for those genes showing no similarity to sequences with known functions, this study provides evidence of their actual expression and suggests clues to their possible biological roles in f <dig>  expression of proteins involved in cell motility  characterized the global protein profile of m9l-grown control cells but were not represented in the lb sub-proteome. similarly, proteins belonging to the following cog categories were not identified in lb control samples: defense mechanisms ; intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport ; and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism  .

differential expression in chromate-stressed lb-derived proteome
comparative analysis of the cr-challenged and control lb samples revealed a total of  <dig> proteins exhibiting a significant reproducible change in abundance in response to cr treatment, with  <dig> of those proteins up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . prominent up-regulated proteins included three periplasmic binding proteins , methyltransferase type  <dig> , fumarate lyase , the antioxidative enzyme superoxide dismutase , haem oxygenase , a tonb-dependent hemoglobin/transferrin/lactoferrin family receptor , a 2-oxoglutarate - and fe-dependent oxygenase , and a functionally unknown two-component transcriptional regulator of the winged helix family  . additionally, five amino acid adenylation domain-containing proteins  encoded within a gene cluster showed increased synthesis in response to chromate stress only under lb growth conditions . in general, the most frequently represented cog functional group in the up-regulated lb-derived proteome dataset was inorganic ion transport and metabolism . proteins belonging to this role category were associated predominantly with iron homeostasis or metabolism  .

fdr: false discovery rate

down-regulated proteins constituted a small subset dominated by proteins with annotated functions in energy production and transcriptional regulation or signal transduction mechanisms . whereas superoxide dismutase  was preferentially up-regulated under cr challenge, the relative abundance of catalase/peroxidase hpi , a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide , decreased in cr-exposed cells compared to the untreated control cells. only one protein  involved in iron metabolism or homeostasis was identified as being down-regulated in the lb proteome under chromate conditions in marked contrast to the numerous proteins of similar function shown to be up-regulated under identical conditions.

differential expression in chromate-stressed m9l-derived proteome
a total of  <dig> proteins exhibited statistically significant altered abundance  in response to acute chromate challenge under m9l growth conditions . among these,  <dig> were uniquely identified with dramatic changes in their expression levels under chromate challenge or control conditions . similar to the lb proteome dataset, the majority of differentially expressed proteins were identified as being up-regulated , while a smaller proportion  were down-regulated. in general, for the up-regulated sub-proteome, the most affected cog functional groups were those containing proteins of unknown function or no specific assigned function , as well as those with annotated functions in cell wall membrane and envelope biogenesis , inorganic ion transport/metabolism , and cell motility . in contrast to the differential protein profile generated under lb-chromate conditions, m9l proteins grouping in the role category of inorganic ion transport/metabolism were not specifically related to fe uptake and utilization based on sequence annotation but instead had functions in the uptake of alternative sulfur sources or unknown substrates . prominently up-regulated proteins involved in sulfur uptake and sulfur assimilatory metabolism included a taurine dioxygenase , an abc-type nitrate/sulfonate/bicarbonate transport system component , and an aliphatic sulfonates family abc transporter  . these proteins are involved in scavenging sulfur from alternative sulfur sources such as aliphatic sulfonates . specifically, taud catalyzes the oxygenolytic release of sulfite from taurine  <cit> , thereby allowing sulfonates to enter the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway at the stage of sulfite  <cit> .

fdr: false discovery rate

the table shows top  <dig> up-regulated and down-regulated proteins in cr-shocked, m9l-grown cells of p. putida when compared to unstressed m9l cells. proteome datasets were analyzed using the poisson regression model combined with false discovery rate  of 1%.

another conspicuous feature of the chromate-perturbed m9l proteome profile was the differential expression of proteins with functions in dna replication, recombination and repair. an atpase involved in dna repair-like protein , atp-dependent dna helicase rep , dna repair protein recn , ribonuclease h , and uracil-dna glycosylase  showed a high poisson coefficient regression in response to chromate . peptides corresponding to the sos-response transcriptional repressor lexa  were detected only in control  m9l cell samples , suggesting that the sos pathway of dna repair  is activated in response to chromate exposure. along with expression of the co-chaperone hsp <dig>  the up-regulation of dna recombination and repair proteins indicates the greater toxic effect of chromate imposed on m9l-grown cells.

the two most highly represented cog categories  for proteins with decreased abundance were associated with amino acid transport and metabolism  and energy production and conversion . a number of the down-regulated energy metabolism proteins had annotated functions associated with electron transport chain processes and included a proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase  and a cytochrome c . it is also interesting to note that a nadph-dependent fmn reductase , which exhibits 100% amino acid sequence identity to the chromate reductase chrr from p. putida strain kt <dig>  was detected at negligible levels in untreated  cell samples but was down-regulated in response to acute chromate treatment under m9l and lb growth conditions . chrr is a soluble dimeric flavin mononucleotide-binding flavoprotein that was shown to catalyze full reduction of cr to cr  <cit>  and more recently, was demonstrated to exhibit quinone reductase activity, of importance in protecting p. putida cells against h2o <dig> stress  <cit> .

growth media-independent proteomic responses to chromate
we compared the cr-perturbed proteome profiles for lb- and m9l-grown p. putida f <dig> cells to identify shared molecular signatures  indicative of chromate stress. comparative analysis indicated that eleven proteins detected only in cr-treated cells were common for the two different growth conditions . of these eleven chromate-responsive proteins, seven were determined to be statistically significant based on an fdr cutoff of  <dig>  and consisted of a two-component transcriptional regulator of the winged helix family , fumarate lyase , superoxide dismutase , a tonb-dependent hemoglobin/transferrin/lactoferrin family receptor , 4-hydroxythreonine-4-phosphate dehydrogenase , a fad-dependent oxidoreductase  and ribosomal protein l <dig>  . the functional diversity of these seven proteins, which represent six different cog categories, indicates the complexity of the core cellular response to chromate insult, a response that is likely complicated by secondary or indirect effects. in addition, the very limited subset of shared proteins suggests that growth conditions substantially influence the global molecular response to chromate.

aspectral counts refer to the average spectral counts from two independent ms runs with an fdr cutoff of  <dig> .

the table lists proteins common to chromate stressed, m9l and lb grown cells. the proteins were selected on the basis of their poisson regression score and an fdr of  <dig> . spectral counts for each protein show the proteins to be uniquely expressed in chromate-stressed cells only.

discussion
this global proteomic study was undertaken to interrogate growth media-based differences in the p. putida f <dig> molecular response to the stress of the oxyanion chromate, a widespread anthropogenic contaminant and a current focus of bioremediation efforts by the doe. the ultimate aim was to identify proteome changes reflective of, although not necessarily specific to, early chromate stress in microbial cells irrespective of the nutritional environment. our physiological investigations indicated that the impact of chromate toxicity was largely dependent on the growth medium. rich  medium, for example, was able to support f <dig> growth at input chromate concentrations at least 40-fold greater than any of the defined minimal m9-based media. presently, it is not known whether this observation was due to differences in growth rate as a function of the medium , a higher bioavailability of cr in minimal media, or a lack of sequestration of toxic reduced chromium forms by organic molecules in the media. comparative analysis of the proteomic profiles generated in this study revealed that acute chromate exposure affects, either directly or indirectly, a wide range of cellular processes and functions, with some of the most profound changes in expression occurring among proteins with annotated functions in inorganic ion transport, amino acid transport and metabolism, cell wall membrane and envelope biogenesis, and energy production.

certain hallmark features of the bacterial molecular response to chromate challenge are emerging with the increasing availability of transcriptomic and proteomic descriptions of cr-challenged microorganisms. comparative analysis of the lb- and m9l-derived proteomes described here revealed that an adaptive strategy employed by p. putida f <dig> in response to acute chromate exposure was up-regulation of proteins involved in sulfate transport , cysteine biosynthesis , and the uptake and utilization of alternative sulfur sources such as aliphatic sulfonates  . because of its structural similarity to so42-, exogenous chromate  competes with sulfate for transport across bacterial cell membranes via sulfate anion transport systems  <cit> , leading to low internal levels of sulfur. up-regulation of genes/proteins with annotated functions in sulfur transport and metabolism has been observed in other chromate-stressed gammaproteobacteria  <cit>  as well as in the highly chromate-resistant arthrobacter sp. strain fb <dig>  a high g + c actinobacterium  <cit> . using two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis, ackerley et al.  <cit>  showed that chromate-challenged nonadapted e. coli k- <dig> cells contained increased abundance levels of cysk and cysn, while challenged pre-adapted cells expressed alkane sulfonate monooxygenase, which functions by converting alkane sulfonates to sulfite and aldehyde. similarly, multidimensional hplc-ms/ms analysis of shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> exposed to different sub-lethal concentrations of chromate demonstrated increased abundance of cysteine synthase a , sulfate adenylyltransferase , adenylylsulfate kinase , sulfite reductase , and periplasmic sulfate-binding protein   <cit> . a recent study investigating chromate resistance in pseudomonas corrugata  <dig>  a cr-hyper-resistant  bacterium, demonstrated that cr susceptibility was attributed to insertional inactivation of osca, which encodes a hypothetical small protein of unknown function and is located in a gene cluster with components of the sulfate abc transporter system  <cit> . we previously reported that s. oneidensis so <dig>  a homolog of osca  <cit> , was up-regulated at both the transcript and protein levels during the entry response to cr stress  <cit> . viti et al.  <cit>  showed that the p. corrugata osca-sbp transcriptional unit was strongly overexpressed after chromate exposure, thus lending further support for the link between sulfate starvation and cr stress response. sufficient cysteine availability is critical not only for protein biosynthesis but also in the defense against metal-induced oxidative stress by maintaining cellular redox homeostasis through the production of protective thiol-containing compounds such as glutathione. therefore, the up-regulation of genes/proteins involved in sulfur transport and metabolism constitutes a major and conserved cellular response among gammaproteobacteria to the oxidative burden imposed by chromate challenge.

reduced p. putida f <dig> growth rates and higher sensitivity to chromate in m9l medium may be attributable to stress resulting from low intracellular sulfate levels as well as high intracellular chromate levels. the sole source of sulfate in m9l medium is mgso <dig>  which is likely transported into the cell by the sulfate active transport system. this transport system has been shown in other pseudomonas species to be principally responsible for the uptake of chromate  <cit> . as already mentioned, chromate is a competitive inhibitor of sulfate uptake  <cit> . reduced sulfate uptake is compensated for by increased uptake of cysteine and cysteine-containing compounds  through alternative transporter systems not competitively inhibited by chromate. cysteine is freely available in complex lb medium but not in m9l medium. the reduced availability of cysteine in m9l medium could have resulted in lower levels of intracellular cysteine needed for important cellular biosynthetic processes, leading to the more striking reduced growth rates and chromate sensitivity of cells cultivated in m9l medium compared to lb medium.

chromate toxicity has been attributed primarily to oxidative stress generated by the intracellular reduction of cr to the transient highly reactive radical cr, which redox cycles and thereby creates reactive oxygen species   <cit> . ros production leads to the damage of such cellular components as dna and proteins. presumably to counter cr-induced oxidative stress, synthesis of the antioxidant defense protein mn/fe-binding superoxide dismutase , which catalyzes decomposition of superoxide anion  to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen, was detected only in cr-exposed lb- and m9l-grown p. putida f <dig> cells. similarly, the up-regulation of sod at the transcript or protein level was observed for cr-stressed e. coli  <cit>  and the alphaproteobacterium caulobacter crescentus  <cit>  but not for s. oneidensis mr- <dig> cells subjected to an acute chromate treatment  <cit> . instead, katg- <dig>  and katb  were preferentially induced at cr exposure time intervals of  <dig> and  <dig> min. based on our proteomic analyses, the enhancement of free-radical detoxifying activities constitutes a vital cellular defense mechanism against chromate toxicity in p. putida f <dig> regardless of the growth medium, whereas cellular defenses against h2o <dig>  were not required during the early stages of chromate exposure in contrast to that observed for s. oneidensis mr- <dig> 

located immediately upstream of the f <dig> sod gene is fumc , which also was identified only in cr-stressed cells under both growth media conditions . the gene synteny is similar  to that found in the genome of pseudomonas aeruginosa, in which an o2·- resistant isoform of fumarase  is linked to downstream genes orfx  and soda  in an iron-responsive operon  <cit> . fumarase catalyzes the reversible conversion of fumarate to malate in the tca cycle and has been shown to be up-regulated under iron-limiting conditions in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether expression of p. putida f <dig> fumc exclusively in cr-challenged cells is part of an iron starvation response.

as previously demonstrated for s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit>  and c. crescentus  <cit> , another prominent characteristic of the cellular response to acute chromate exposure is the up-regulation of genes/proteins with functions in iron acquisition and homeostasis, namely tonb-dependent receptors and siderophore biosynthesis proteins. similarly, tonb-dependent receptors for high-affinity iron chelators were a conspicuous feature of up-regulated, cr-perturbed p. putida sub-proteomes, particularly under lb growth conditions. the increased abundance of four such outer membrane receptors under lb-cr conditions is likely connected with the concomitant up-regulation of five amino acid adenylation domains. the adenylation  domains represent the active core of each modular unit comprising large multifunctional enzymes termed nonribosomal peptide synthetases  <cit> . the a domain functions by recognizing a specific amino or hydroxyl acid substrate and activating it as aminoacyl adenylate via atp hydrolysis. while nonribosomal peptide synthetases can produce peptides of broad and sometimes obscure biological activity, these multidomain enzymes are known to be involved in the assembly of aryl-capped peptide and peptide-polyketide siderophores from pseudomonas spp.  <cit> . furthermore, expression of a tonb-dependent hemoglobin/transferrin/lactoferrin family receptor  as part of the media-independent core molecular response to chromate exposure points to iron availability and homeostasis as playing an important role in the cellular adaptation of f <dig> to chromate stress.

earlier reports revealed a distinct link between cell sensitivity to chromate and iron availability. it was observed, for example, that tonb mutants of e. coli exhibited increased sensitivity to chromium salts  <cit> , which could be relieved by adding iron to the growth medium  <cit> . more recently, siderophores produced by certain pseudomonas species were shown to bind exogenous transition metals other than fe with appreciable affinity  <cit> , thus invoking conditions of low internal iron. the siderophore pyridine- <dig> -bis  from pseudomonas stutzeri kc, for example, has been shown to detoxify extracellular chromium, selenium, and tellurium oxyanions, suggesting that pdtc functions not only in iron acquisition but also in an initial line of defense against metal toxicity  <cit> . research is required to delineate the physiological basis for the increased expression of iron acquisition receptors in response to acute chromate stress.

the cr-responsive proteomic subset shared between the two different growth conditions consisted mostly of structural proteins with the exception of one regulatory protein, annotated as a two-component response regulator  belonging to the winged helix-turn-helix family of dna-binding regulators. prototypical two-component systems, which constitute the predominant mechanism used by bacteria for coupling environmental signals to specific adaptive responses, comprise a sensor histidine kinase and a cognate response regulator  <cit> . the regulatory targets for the p. putida response regulator have not previously been identified. a similar observation was noted for cr-stressed s. oneidensis mr- <dig> cells in which a dna-binding response regulator , also of the ompr/phob subfamily  <cit>  of winged-helix dna-binding domains, was detected at the protein level only in chromate-challenged cells  <cit> . further in-depth functional analysis using a Δso <dig> mutant strain found that this two-component response regulator likely is involved in the activation of genes required for siderophore-mediated iron acquisition  <cit> . a dna-binding response regulator consisting of a chey-like receiver domain also was up-regulated  in cr-treated c. crescentus  <cit> . at this point, it is not known whether expression of pput  <dig> is part of a cellular regulatory system for sensing external toxic metals or a secondary effect of cr challenge.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, effective bioremediation strategies should encompass an understanding of the fundamental physiological and molecular processes extant in the remediating populations. ideally, one would like to perform such studies in the most ecologically relevant context, but the trade-off is that in situ it is difficult to control enough variables to make the results interpretable. as described here, we have monitored growth and proteome expression in the laboratory under disparate but controlled nutrient conditions ranging from the less  to the more ecologically relevant . we have shown that a strain of p. putida, f <dig>  well-known for its ability to degrade aromatic xenobiotics, is also resistant to low mm levels of cr and is capable of reducing hexavalent chromium. furthermore, the proteome expressed in response to acute chromate challenge is dependent upon factors other than just the presence of external chromate. most importantly, we have identified in this study a core set of proteins that are differentially expressed in response to cr challenge that appear to be media-independent, and this core protein subset will serve as a baseline for comparison with future proteomic analyses of p. putida-containing microbial communities in naturally occurring cr-contaminated soils.
