BACKGROUND
various cellular functions need atp for energy supply. adenylate kinase  is a phosphotransferase that catalyzes the reversible reaction 2adp ↔ atp + amp in the presence of mg2+ and influences cellular energy homeostasis and cellular adenine nucleotide metabolism  <cit> . the widespread and highly conserved distribution of ak has been reported in organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. prokaryotic cells  <cit>  and eukaryotic yeasts  <cit>  have a single-type gene of ak essential for their survival, which indicates the significance of ak in energy metabolism. multicellular organisms have obtained diverse isoenzymes of ak through evolution. to date, eight isoenzymes of the ak family comprising ak1-ak <dig> have been identified in vertebrates forming a circuit in monitoring cell energy metabolism and amp signal transduction  <cit> . among these isoenzymes, ak <dig> is uniquely located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space distributed in the liver and kidney  <cit> . the unique subcellular localization suggests that ak <dig> plays a unique role in energy metabolism and energy transfer by regulating the atp/adp rate between the cytoplasma matrix and the mitochondria  <cit> .

several studies have been conducted on the functions of ak. ak <dig> knockout in mice shows compromised energy deficiency in the heart and skeletal muscles under metabolic stress  <cit> . the growth and development of caenorhabditis elegans is suppressed after the knockdown of ak <dig>  <cit> . the knockdown of zebra fish ak <dig>  the only type of ak in leukocytes, causes leukocyte development defects, thus indicating the importance of ak <dig> in leukocyte differentiation  <cit> . a recent study reveals that the homozygous ak <dig>  larvae of drosophila melanogaster ceases growth and causes death before reaching the third instar larval stage, indicating that ak <dig> is necessary for the growth and development of d. melanogaster <cit> .

ak <dig> has been reported to be involved in cell proliferation. in humans, mutations in the ak <dig> gene cause a profound haematopoietic defect because ak <dig> is required for the proliferation and differentiation of haematopoetic cells  <cit> . however, others report the involvement of ak <dig> in cell apoptosis as ak <dig> translocates from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol together with cytochrome c during apoptosis  <cit> . ak <dig> participates in mitochondrial apoptosis by forming a complex with fas-associating protein with death domain  and caspase  <dig> in the hela cell line, whereas ak <dig> knockdown attenuates apoptosis  <cit> . therefore, the real function of ak <dig> in regulating cell growth or apoptosis remains unclear.

this study used a lepidopteran insect h. armigera and its epidermal cell line   <cit>  as models to investigate the roles of ak <dig> in cell growth and development. the results show that ak <dig> from h. armigera shares high identity with other ak <dig> from various animals. ak <dig> is constitutively expressed in various tissues during larval development and locates in the mitochondria, similar to ak <dig> in vertebrates. recombinantly expressed ak <dig> in escherichia coli increases haepi cell growth and viability. ak <dig> knockdown in larvae results in larval growth arrest, body weight decrease, developmental stage delay, and decrease of circulating haemocytes. the mechanism behind these phenomena is the suppression of gene transcription involved in insect development caused by ak <dig> knockdown. results show that ak <dig> plays critical roles in cell proliferation and insect development.

RESULTS
helicoverpa ak <dig> shares high identity with ak <dig> in various animals
the cdna of h. armigera ak <dig> is  <dig>  bp in length and encodes a  <dig> amino acid residue protein with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda. the predicted isoelectric point of helicoverpa ak <dig> is  <dig> . no signal sequence is detected. ak <dig> contains a core adk domain flanked by an atp binding domain lid. helicoverpa ak <dig> shares higher identities with other ak <dig> genes from d. melanogaster , anopheles gambiae , danio rerio , mus musculus , and homo sapiens . phylogenetic analysis shows that ak <dig> from various animals cluster into two main groups: 1) ak <dig> from vertebrates and 2) ak <dig> from insects. helicoverpa ak <dig> is clustered with insect ak <dig> .

ak <dig> is constitutively expressed in various tissues during larval development
the expression profiles of ak <dig> were examined in the tissues during larval development to investigate the role of ak <dig> in insect development. western blot shows that ak <dig> expresses in various tissues, including in the epidermis, midgut, body fat, and haemocytes. the translation levels of ak <dig> reflect a constitutive expression in four tissues during development from the 5th instar  <dig> h larvae  to the 1st day pupae . these results imply that ak <dig> is essential during insect larval development .

ak <dig> is co-localized with mitochondria
immunocytochemistry was performed in the helicoverpa epidermal cell line  to determine the location of ak <dig> in the cells. results show that ak <dig> locates in the cytoplasm and appears as dots , implying its location in the cellular organs. further co-localization of ak <dig> with mitochondria  shows that ak <dig> is mostly overlapped with mitochondria. an orange color results from the overlap of green-colored ak <dig> and red-colored mitochondria . some dots of ak <dig> do not overlap completely with mitochondria, owing to the difference in the focus of the images from the microscope. the preserum control did not produce any green fluorescence, indicating that the antiserum against ak <dig> is specific to ak <dig> . the non mitotracker control indicates the specificity of mitochondria staining . this result suggests that ak <dig> locates in the mitochondria.

recombinantly expressed ak <dig> in e. coli promotes cell growth and viability
ak <dig> was expressed as a soluble his-tagged protein in e. coli and purified to homogeny to analyze the function of ak <dig> in cell growth. the molecular mass of the purified his-ak <dig> is about  <dig> kda, comprising ak <dig>  and his-tag  .

the purified his-ak <dig> was added into the grace’s medium to culture epidermal cells  to assay the function of ak <dig>  the results of mtt assay show that his-ak <dig> promotes cell growth and viability at concentrations from  <dig>  μm to  <dig> μm in  <dig> h, compared with the his-vp <dig> negative control, an envelope protein of the white spot syndrome virus expressed in e. coli fused with his-tag .

western blot analysis shows that his-ak <dig> entered the haepi cells to promote cell growth and viability, because his-ak <dig> was only detected from cells incubated with his-ak <dig>  it was present in neither the pbs buffer used in washing the his-ak2-incubated cells nor in the non-his-ak2-incubated cells . to confirm the entrance of the recombinant expressed his-ak <dig> in the cells, immunocytochemistry was done and his-ak <dig> was detected in the cells by the antibody against his-tag .

ak <dig> knockdown represses larval growth and development
ak <dig> was knocked down by rnai via continuously feeding the newly hitched larvae with e. coli that expresses dsrna of ak <dig> until the larvae stopped eating  to investigate the roles of ak <dig> in vivo in insect development. western blot results show that ak <dig> was knocked down systemically in various tissues, including epidermis, midgut, body fat, and haemocytes by feeding dsak2-expressing e. coli .

due to ak <dig> knockdown, the larvae that fed on dsak2-expressing e. coli exhibited growth defects and development delay, by comparison with the control that fed on dsgfp-expressing e. coli. the larvae grew slowly after knockdown of ak <dig> and the body weight was lower than those of the controls . in addition, the pupation time in the larvae that fed on dsak <dig> delayed about  <dig> days compared the control . these results suggest that ak <dig> is necessary for larval growth and development.

to confirm that the ak <dig> knockdown did not induce off-target effects on other genes, the helicoverpa ak <dig>  was examined by semi-quantity rt-pcr. results showed that ak <dig> knockdown did not affect the mrna level of ak <dig> , indicating that no markedly off-target effects was induced by ak <dig> rnai.

ak <dig> knockdown suppresses haemocyte proliferation
circulating haemocytes were calculated after ak <dig> knockdown by feeding dsak2-expressing e. coli to the newly hitched larvae to examine the role of ak <dig> in cell proliferation. as expected, ak <dig> knockdown caused the cell number of circulating haemocytes in the 6th instar  <dig> h larvae decrease, compared with the dsgfp-expressing e. coli fed control . this finding indicates that ak <dig> is necessary for the proliferation of circulating haemocytes.

ak <dig> knockdown decreased the gene transcripts
the transcripts of some genes involved in development were examined to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of growth retardation and delayed development of larvae after ak <dig> knockdown by feeding dsak2-expressing e. coli. the results of semi-quantitative rt-pcr showed that knockdown of ak <dig> caused suppression of the molting hormone nuclear receptor ecrb <dig>  transcription factors usp <dig> and br, as well as protein kinase akt genes . these results suggest that ak <dig> knockdown decreased the gene transcripts.

discussion
the subcelluar localization of ak <dig> in the mitochondria indicates that it plays a unique role in regulating cell energy homeostasis to balance atp/adp between cytosol and mitochondria  <cit> . h. armigera ak <dig> localizes in the mitochondria, too. h. armigera ak <dig> shows high identity to other ak <dig> from various animals, including mammals, indicating that its function in regulating the growth and development of organisms is conserved. the current work demonstrates that ak <dig> promotes cell growth and proliferation in larval growth and development.

ak <dig> is necessary for the survival of drosophila, because the lack of ak <dig> gene leads to growth defects and death  <cit> . the constitutive expression pattern of helicoverpa ak <dig> implies that ak <dig> is essential for the development and growth of insect. ak <dig> knockdown in h. armigera results in growth defects, including growth retardation, body weight decrease, and development delay. however, the larvae ultimately experienced pupae and advanced to adult. this might because that rnai cannot deplete ak <dig> gene completely as the mutation in drosophila. mammalian ak <dig> is increased expression during adipocyte and b cell differentiation  <cit> . however, in drosophila, the mrna and protein of ak <dig> are detected in the embryo, larva, and adult  <cit> . helicoverpa ak <dig> is expressed in the examined tissues consistently during development. the reason of the different expression profiles in mammals and insects might because the difference between the organisms.

ak <dig> silencing resulted in development arrest might due to the suppression of the gene expression involved in development. ecrb <dig>  usp <dig>  and broad are involved in 20e signaling pathway  <cit> . the protein kinase akt promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis  <cit> . the suppression of these genes after ak <dig> knockdown might be related to the larval growth arrest and development delay.

reports state that high adp concentration causes damage to the cells  <cit> . ak <dig> knockout in mice shows no gross abnormalities in nucleotides levels under normal condition; but under hypoxia hypoxia ak <dig> knockout hearts, intracellular atp levels was decreased, pi/atp ratio was increased and generation of adenosine was suppressed  <cit> . adp levels are accumulated during repetitive contractions of skeletal muscle in ak <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . in yeast disruption of ak gene causes accumulation of atp in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, thus suppress adenine nucleotide translocator exported atp in exchange for adp  <cit> .

human ak <dig> plays an important role in providing the energy required for the proliferation of haematopoietic precursors  <cit> . overexpression of ak promoted atp production notably in yeasts  <cit> , indicating that overexpressing ak <dig> supplies adequate atp for cell proliferation. our study shows that recombinant expressed ak <dig> promotes haepi cell growth and viability in vitro by mtt assay. mtt assay indicates cell growth and viability; however, it is also often used in cell proliferation detection. for example, the cell survival promoted by overexpressed ak <dig> under environmental stress  <cit>  and the proliferation of mcf- <dig> human breast cancer cells in various treatments  <cit> . the in vivo function of helicoverpa ak <dig> to promote cell proliferation is confirmed by the decrease in the number of circulating haemocytes after ak <dig> knockdown. insect-circulating haemocytes are supplied by haemopoiesis in the haemopoietic organs or by mitotic division of a circulating stem cell  <cit> . ak <dig> knockdown decreases circulating haemocytes, suggesting that ak <dig> functions in promoting cell proliferation.

the recombinant expressed non-secreted proteins are able to enter the invertebrate heamocytes after being injected into the heamolymph  <cit> , which might because the endocytosis of the invertebrate heamocytes. we found the recombinant expressed non-secreted ak <dig> is able to enter the cultured epidermal cells. the mechanism of the recombinant expressed protein entering the cultured cells without degradation might because that the endocytosis ability of the cells, the culture medium, or the culture temperature is different from the mammals.

CONCLUSIONS
h. armigera ak <dig> shows high identity to other ak <dig> from various animals. ak <dig> is essential to the larval growth and development. the function of ak <dig> is to promote cell growth. the recombinant expressed ak <dig> in e. coli is able to promote cell growth and viability in vitro. ak <dig> is necessary for maintaining the circulating haemocytes number. ak <dig> is involved in regulating mrna levels of the genes involved in insect growth and development.
