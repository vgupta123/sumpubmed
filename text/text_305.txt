BACKGROUND
dna adduct formation is an early critical event in the process of carcinogenesis by which many chemical carcinogens exert their biological effects. with few exceptions, however, carcinogens form dna adducts in many tissues, leading to the view that adducts are necessary, but not sufficient, for carcinogenesis. thus, although there are linear relationships between dose, adduct levels in target organs and tumour incidence  <cit> , it may be difficult to identify which organs are targets for carcinogenicity by an agent purely from a consideration of the levels and persistence of dna damage. several studies using transgenic mice demonstrate that there is also a lack of correlation between carcinogen-induced increases in mutation frequency and target organ specificity . these findings suggest the importance of events subsequent to dna damage and mutation in determining organotropism and inter-species differences of carcinogens.

there have been reports of early gene expression changes in animal tissues following exposure to carcinogens or toxins, but thus far most studies have been limited to examinations of one target tissue with, usually, one non-target tissue . no study has yet attempted to compare several target and non-target tissues in order to define the critical events subsequent to dna damage and mutation that may determine carcinogen organotropism.

in the present study we have tested the hypothesis that carcinogen-induced changes in gene expression or mirna expression may distinguish target organs from non-target ones. balb/c mice were treated with multiple carcinogenic doses of benzopyrene , after which dna adduct levels and gene and mirna expression changes were measured in three target organs  and three non-target organs . we found some similar expression changes in at least some of the target organs, but that the majority of the early gene expression changes were tissue specific, as were some of the biological processes related to the modulated genes. nevertheless, the results shed new light on the complexity of the mechanism of bap carcinogenicity and identify some responses that may determine the carcinogen’s organotropism.

RESULTS
dna adducts
32p-postlabelling analysis of dna from all six organs of bap-treated mice  showed a single adduct spot on tlc . the radioactivity in this spot co-chromatographed with that produced by the standard benzopyrene diol-epoxide -modified dna  <cit> . tlc plates of dna from control animals were devoid of adducts . adduct levels in the six organs are shown in figure 1b. for each organ, levels were not significantly different between males and females . they were higher in mice treated with ten daily doses than in those treated with five: 50% higher in lung, 65% higher in spleen, 138% higher in forestomach, 41% higher in liver, 177% higher in colon and 80% higher in glandular stomach. the increases from five to ten doses were significant  for all organs except lung. differences in dna adduct levels among the organs  or between pairs of target and non-target organs  were not significant . thus there was no significant distinction between target and non-target organs for dna adduct formation.figure  <dig>

gene expression profiles
by comparing pooled expression profiles from all bap-treated samples from experiment  <dig>  with corn oil-treated controls for each organ, we identified  <dig> genes in lung,  <dig> in spleen,  <dig> in forestomach,  <dig> in liver,  <dig> in colon and  <dig> in glandular stomach as significantly modulated by bap , combining to a total of  <dig> genes . this gene list was used for the subsequent cluster and functional analyses. expression profiles were pooled in order to increase the power of the test and to reduce the weight of any one sample reducing the effect of outliers.

principal component analysis  and hierarchical cluster analysis 
pca was used to analyse the expression profile of genes modulated significantly by bap in at least one organ . separate or nearly separate clusters were observed for lung, spleen and liver . in contrast, there was overlap for the conditions in forestomach, colon and glandular stomach. the expression profiles of modulated genes uniquely define two of the target organs, lung and spleen. it is clear that the variations due to tissue differences are greater than variations due to bap treatment.

in hierarchical clustering, the six profiles  for each organ clustered together . there was a closer similarity between the expression patterns of forestomach  and glandular stomach  than between any of the other organs. again, the target organs lung and spleen clustered separately from the other organs. the corn-oil control samples clustered with the bap-treated samples from the same organ again indicating that differences in expression profiles between organs were greater that the change induced by bap.figure  <dig>

the dose and gender effects on gene expression were investigated with 2-way anova for each of the six organs. we did not find any clear dose- or gender-dependent expression in any of the organs.

target versusnon-target gene comparisons
when comparing the genes modulated by bap at three or more exposure conditions, no gene was significantly modulated in all target organs but not in any non-target organ, or vice versa. actb, pdia <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps <dig> and tmed <dig> were identified to be up-regulated by bap in comparison with corn oil-treated controls in two out of three target organs and in none of the non-target organs, whilst three genes were found to be down-regulated . rpl <dig> was found to be up-regulated in two out of three non-target organs and in none of the target organs. tubb <dig> was found to be down-regulated in spleen and forestomach  and up-regulated in the colon .

examining the results of the differential analysis performed on samples pooled by organ it was found that  <dig> probes had a significant modulation caused by bap in the same direction for either all target organs or all non-target organs . of these, genes actg <dig>  crk and dnajc <dig>  and clones h3098d <dig> and h3068a <dig> were found to be up-regulated in all target organs and down-regulated or not modulated in all non-target organs. psmd <dig> was down-regulated in target organs only and pfpl was up-regulated in non-target organs only. sdccag <dig> was up-regulated in all organs and hspa <dig> in five organs. hbb-y and hba-a <dig> were generally down-regulated in all organs.table  <dig>

functional analysis of the modulated genes
we applied various bioinformatics approaches using the bap-induced genes  to identify which biological activities are modulated in bap tumourigenesis. firstly, in gene ontology  analysis, the comparison of biological processes revealed considerable variation between the six organs . a few biological processes were common to all organs, and most of these were related to basic physiological activities like metabolic , biosynthetic  and macromolecule biosynthetic  processes. conversely, a number of processes showed tissue specificity, especially some cancer-associated processes, for example, response to oxidative stress in lung  and cell growth in glandular stomach . comparisons between organs suggested that processes including translational initiation , polyamine metabolic process , protein-rna complex assembly  and regulation of protein metabolic process  represented target organ-specific functions while gas transport  was the only process common to all the non-target organs. as we were assessing the effects of bap treatment we also examined functions known to be involved in response to other external stimuli, such as response to stress , to dna damage stimulus  and to oxidative stress . we found that these appeared to be different in different organs, but do not fully distinguish target from non-target organs . other interesting activities such as dna packaging , apoptosis  and cell proliferation  were connected to cell cycle regulatory activities. interestingly, these biological processes are also mainly altered in two target organs .

secondly, approximately half of the bap-modulated genes in each organ were associated with regulatory or metabolic pathways. over 90% of the pathways were found in more than one organ but most were common to two or three organs only. a few pathways, including cell cycle , mapk signalling, wnt signalling  and jak-sat signalling , were modulated in all six organs , although different genes were found to be modulated in each case. for example, only ccnd <dig> expression in the wnt signalling pathway was altered in all six organs. no pathway activated by bap distinguished all three target organs from all three non-target organs.

thirdly, the interactive relationships among bap-modulated genes in each organ were investigated by gene association network analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis . over 50% of the significantly modulated genes were present in networks. networks commonly have one or more core  gene that links to many others within the network. nfκb in network  <dig> of lung , for example, can be regulated by  <dig> genes  and it may regulate three others . other core genes including erbb <dig>  ctnnb <dig>  fos, myc, trp <dig>  tnf, stat <dig>  h-ras, hspa <dig> and mapk are associated with networks that had significantly modulated genes. of these, fos and hspa <dig> were themselves modulated. we did not find any network functions that distinguished the target from the non-target organs. instead, cancer, cell cycle, protein synthesis and post-translation modification were network functions common to all six organs.figure  <dig>

taqman gene expression validation
the expression of  <dig> genes was measured by real-time pcr . these were selected because they were differentially modulated by bap between target and non-target organs, differentially modulated in most organs, core network genes or part of important pathways found to be modulated in the functional analyses. ephx1
 <cit> , cyp1a1
 <cit>  and trp53
 <cit>  were chosen as they have previously been highlighted as important in bap modulation. table  <dig> shows the expression changes of these  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> genes modulated by bap represent transcriptional differences between target organs and non-target organs trp <dig> and pcna were down-regulated in two target organs ; cdh <dig>  ctnnb <dig> and apc were down-regulated in non-target organs ; and src was up-regulated in two target organs  . additionally, ccng <dig>  ephx <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  stat <dig> and hspa <dig> were consistently up-regulated in the six organs. looking at differences in expression between bap-treated and control mice as a ratio and pooling according to target status, we found eight genes  to be modulated significantly differently between target and non-target tissue . even for these genes, a tissue might be more consistent with the opposite group rather than with its own. for example, for the top hit tubb <dig>  the gene with the most significant difference, forestomach seems to be more consistent with the non-target tissues.table  <dig>

microrna  expression
the expressions of  <dig> mouse mirnas on the microarray were first analysed using hierarchical cluster analysis . the majority of changes of mirna expressions pattern were distinct for each of the six organs and the target organs did not cluster separately from the non-target organs. instead, the results indicate that the profiles of bap-induced mirna expression changes in the six mouse organs are tissue specific.figure  <dig>

discussion
bap is a well-studied multi-organ and multi-species genotoxic carcinogen. its carcinogenic potency and organotropism in mice depends both on the route of administration and on the dose . hakura et al.  <cit>  treated mice with 125 mg/kg b.wt/day of bap by oral gavage for five consecutive days, which induced tumours in the forestomach, spleen and lung. in the present study, we treated balb/c mice with bap according to the same protocol. in addition, we administered this daily dose for a longer period  in order to look for temporal changes in dna adduct levels and gene expression. we also used 2- and 3-fold higher doses to investigate dose-related effects on gene expression. forestomach, spleen and lung, the three target organs, were examined and we chose liver, colon and glandular stomach as non-target organs for comparison.

dna adduct formation
as expected, bap induced the same dna adduct pattern, consistent with metabolic activation to the  <dig> -dihydrodiol  <dig> -epoxide and covalent binding to the n <dig> position of guanine  <cit> , in all organs examined. the similar levels of binding in males and females is consistent with the carcinogenic equipotency of bap in both sexes, but the order of dna adduct formation – spleen ≥ liver > lung > glandular stomach ≥ colon > forestomach – did not correlate with the susceptibility of the organs to bap carcinogenicity  <cit> .

previous research has shown that mutation frequency in organs of bap-treated mice was in the order of colon > forestomach > spleen > glandular stomach > liver = lung, while tumour incidence was in the order forestomach > spleen > lung after treating male mutamouse with 125 mg/kg b.wt/day of bap for 5 days by oral gavage  <cit> . there are other examples of a lack of correlation between dna adducts, mutation frequency and tumour incidence in different organs of carcinogen-treated mice  <cit> , although some level of correlation between mutation frequency and target organs , or between adduct levels and target organs  <cit> , has been observed in some rodent studies.

while dna adduct formation and mutation induction are important initiating events in carcinogenesis, these findings point to the possible role of subsequent events in determining the organotropism of chemical carcinogens. thus in the present study we analysed microarray expression data from six organs of mice treated with bap to look for tissue-specific changes. in total, data were collected from  <dig> hybridisations.

tissue-specific gene expression profiles
the analysis of the data from individual conditions  by pca and by hca showed that all datasets from a single organ usually grouped together.

specificity of gene expression changes induced in tissues or cell lines has been reported previously. for example, brain, lung, liver and spleen each displayed a unique altered transcriptional signature in responding to infection  <cit> . organ-specific gene expression profiles were found in c57bl/ <dig> mice after low dose radiation, with the genes altered in spleen especially different from other organs  <cit> . we found that patterns from spleen and lung  were the most distinct. in human studies, shyamsundar et al.  <cit>  found tissue-specific expression patterns when comparing  <dig> human tumour tissues to their normal tissues. other evidence for human tumour tissue gene expression specificity includes data presented for brain, breast, colon, endometrium, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, prostate, skin and thyroid cancers .

target organs versusnon-target organs
variations in the genes induced in target and non-target organs after carcinogen exposures have been reported, between kidney  and liver  following treatment of rats and mice with aristolochic acid  <cit>  or of rats with ochratoxin a  <cit> , and between lung  and liver  of mice treated with bap  <cit> . however, because only a single target and non-target organ were examined in these studies, it is possible that differences in the genes induced in the two tissues may represent organ-specific changes unrelated to carcinogenesis. the current study has addressed this limitation by comparing three target and three non-target organs.

hundred of genes were significantly modulated by bap in each organ and the pca results revealed that the overall gene expression profile in the target organ group differed from those regulated in the non-target organ group. interestingly, two target organs  presented strong variations from the three non-target organs while another target organ, forestomach, was closer to the non-target organs. hca confirmed this result. this finding is very close to another pca result based on the expression data using oligonucleotide microarrays to capture splicing information of  <dig> mouse tissues  <cit> , which showed clearly that the lung and spleen profiles were distinct from those of liver, colon and stomach. additionally, taqman results confirmed that several genes were modulated by bap in a very similar pattern in lung and spleen, but different from the other four organs. p <dig> signalling pathway genes trp <dig> and pcna were down-regulated, oncogene src was up-regulated. tnfα and nfκb were down-regulated in lung and not changed in spleen. trp <dig> is one of the most studied tumour suppressor genes because its mutation or function loss has been reported in many human and animal cancers . recently a subset of genes were identified to show significantly different expression in p <dig> wild-type  cells relative to p53-null cells after bpde exposure in human colon carcinoma cells , and the loss of this tumour suppressor influenced the metabolic activation of bap  <cit> .

however, forestomach  has an overall profile similar to that of the non-target organs, glandular stomach and colon. one possible reason is that the crucial gene expression changes in forestomach were very few constituting a low percentage of the total variances, for example, single gene deletion in forestomach tumourigenesis such as wwox
 <cit>  and c-h-ras
 <cit> . another possible reason is that the overall cell types between forestomach and glandular stomach are similar and the variations due to bap treatment were not greater than the variations due to cell similarity.

of the eight genes that were modulated significantly differently between target and non-target tissues , two are oncogenes  and three are involved in wnt/β-catenin signalling . cyp1a <dig> encodes the isoform of cytochrome p <dig>  that is principally responsible for bap metabolism. tubb <dig> encodes class v beta-tubulin, overexpression of which in mammalian cells disrupts microtubule organisation and spindle assembly, and blocks cell proliferation  <cit> . cav encodes caveolae protein  <dig> , a scaffolding protein that links integrin subunits to the tyrosine kinase fyn; it is a tumour suppressor gene candidate and a negative regulator of the ras-p42/ <dig> mitogen-activated kinase cascade. it can also facilitate the transit of tyr-phosphorylated stat <dig> into the nucleus  <cit>  and integrin-mediated activation of pi3-k/akt  <cit> . the over-expression of caveolin has been suggested as a biomarker in some human cancers  <cit> . there is also evidence for the interaction of stat <dig> with caveolin and hsp <dig> in plasma membrane raft and cytosolic complex  <cit> . genes including heat shock protein  70kd  and hsp 90kd  interact with stat <dig> by binding to each other and positively activating each other; caveolin can assist in the binding procedure.

in non-target organs, wnt/β-catenin signalling genes cdh <dig>  ctnnb <dig> and apc were down-regulated in colon and glandular stomach. cdh <dig> was also down-regulated in liver and was the only gene that shows mrna changes in all three non-target organs. e-cadherin is associated with invasion and metastasis of human cancers  <cit>  and can be regulated by the wnt pathway. in unstimulated cells most β-catenin is associated with e-cadherin and α-catenin at the cell surface where it helps to mediate cell adhesion  <cit> . the wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway can be regulated during carcinogenesis leading accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus. this result is difficult to interpret in the context of carcinogenesis. the lack of change in expression of cdh <dig> in target organs would allow regulation to continue normally. however, since cell adhesion is decreased during carcinogenesis such down-regulation should not matter. but the story may not be this simple, because abnormal accumulation of β-catenin in both the cytoplasm and nuclei has been reported in during cancer development .

although consistently up-regulated in five organs , stat <dig> was the only gene that exhibited a trend in dose-dependent changes in expression levels in the taqman study based on rt-pcr analysis . dose-dependent changes in expression were observed in almost all exposure conditions in the organs. stat <dig> is a member of a family of six different transcription factors that are closely linked with tumourigenesis. activated stat <dig> has been shown to protect tumour cells from apoptosis and promote cell proliferation by regulating genes coding anti-apoptotic and proliferation-associated proteins such as bcl, ccnd <dig> and c-myc  <cit> . growing evidence suggests that stat <dig> functions as an oncogene and plays a critical role in transformation and tumour progression. stat <dig> may be activated by many growth factors and oncogenic kinases. these growth factors include egf, tgf-α, il- <dig> and hepatocyte growth factors. oncogenic kinases include janus kinase family  and src  <cit> . other reported factors include cox <dig>  <cit> , erbb <dig>  <cit> , jaks & mapk signalling  <cit>  and itgb <dig>  <cit> . erbb <dig>  itgb <dig> and src were differentially expressed in the  <dig> organs in this study.

functional analyses
cdna microarray experiments identified hundreds of bap-modulated genes in each of the six organs, and the potential significance of bap-induced genes was investigated by the analyses of their involvement in particular biological processes, in regulatory or metabolic signalling pathways and in gene association networks.

go analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that organs share some basic responses to bap  <cit> . thus genes involved in basic physiological activities including cellular macromolecule metabolism and cellular physiological process were modulated in most or all organs.

comparing the biological processes between target and non-target organs, it was found that very few changes were common in the target or in the non-target organs, examples being translation initiation and protein-rna complex assembly. these processes may warrant further functional investigation, as many eukaryotic translation initiation factors were significantly modulated by bap in lung , in spleen  and in forestomach .

processes identified mainly in target but also in non-target organs are those associated with cell cycle activity and cellular growth; or the response to external stimulus involving response to stress, response to heat and response to abiotic stimulus. although these processes were mainly modulated in two target organs or in two non-target organs, individual cell cycle activities and responses to external stimulus are potential candidate categories for functions that might discern target organs from non-target organs. under conditions of stress such as dna damage, cell cycle controls many genes to carry out functions including dna repair and apoptosis that repair the aberrant cells or cause cell death  <cit> . carcinogens may induce tumourigenesis partly by mediating cell cycle malfunction. for instance, in mcf- <dig> cells bap induces over-expression of many cell cycle genes including tp <dig> and cdkn1a
 <cit> ; arsenate induces thymus atrophy mediated by cell cycle arrest by down-regulating e2f and related genes  <cit> ;  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  makes cell cycle changes in murine fetal liver  <cit>  and rb loss abrogates cell cycle control and genome integrity to promote liver tumourigenesis  <cit> . the observation that many cell cycle genes are modulated significantly by bap in two or more target organs indicates that processes such as dna replication, cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis may be activated to allow repair or elimination of damaged cells.

the biological processes response to stress  and response to dna damage stimulus  were mainly found in the target organs. these processes are known to be linked to immune response  <cit>  and it is well established that bap modulates immune response; it suppresses the plaque-forming cell  response in adult male deer mice   <cit> ; it can accumulate the ige antibody in serum and il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and ifn-γ secreted by spleen cells in mice  <cit> ; and it has been found be an immune suppressor at high doses, but an enhancer at low doses  <cit> .

over 90% of all pathways appeared in two or three organs and many of the individual pathways could potentially be linked to bap carcinogenesis. it is also possible that pathways common to all or most organs are linked to tumourigenesis. mapk signalling, for instance, is linked to bap carcinogenicity: bap may induce cell cycle arrest through activation of erk/cyclin d <dig> signalling  <cit> ; bap perturbs erk/p <dig> pathway, which causes a decrease in stability and phosphorylation of p <dig> and down-regulation of nfκb activation  <cit> ; and bap activates mapk signalling in mouse cl <dig> cells  <cit> , in raw  <dig>  cells  <cit>  and in a/j mice lung tumourigenesis  <cit> . interestingly, the individual genes involved in mapk signalling showed a strongly tissue-specific profile except for a very few common genes like hspa <dig> 

the wnt signalling pathway was also commonly activated by bap in all organs. the genes, including ccnd <dig>  csnk1a <dig>  ppp2r1a, rock <dig>  cul <dig> and camk2b, were variably modulated. in another study bap caused lef <dig> nh -terminal mutation in k14deltanlef <dig> transgenic mice, which inhibits wnt signalling and prevents induction of p <dig> in skin cancer  <cit> . in a study in which female mice were treated with  <dig> -dimethylbenzanthracene, wnt signalling was up-regulated during mammary tumourigenesis  <cit> .

the genes significantly modulated by bap were analysed with ipa to show their regulatory relationships. most network functions were related to cancer, cell cycle, protein synthesis and cellular development, which existed in almost all the organs. interestingly some core genes showed organ-specific patterns, e.g. ap <dig>  sp <dig> and pi3k, but the majority of core genes were involved in all organs, including trp <dig>  nfκb, tnfα, fos, stat <dig>  myc, ifng and erbb <dig>  if such pathways are of critical importance it is possible that the control of organ specificity of cancer development occurs at a different level with different pathways having different roles in different organs. for example cdkn2a is generally involved in cell cycle control but can induce apoptosis in lung  <cit> .

mirna expression
mirnas are small non-coding rnas of 20– <dig> nucleotides, typically excised from 60– <dig> nucleotide foldback rna precursor structures . they function at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels through imperfect pairing with the target mrna of protein-coding genes. mirnas are related to crucial biological processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation  <cit> . disregulation of mirna function is linked to the development of a variety of cancers, including breast cancer  <cit> , b-cell leukaemia  <cit> , lung cancer  <cit>  and pancreatic cancer  <cit> . mirna expression profiling appears in some instances to provide a better classification of cancer than conventional expression microarray studies  <cit> .

a variety of strategies may be used for mirna detection, including a bead-based flow-cytometric approach  <cit> , quantitative rt-pcr and serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> . in the present study oligonucleotide mirna microarray analysis was used to assess mirnas expression profiles. the purpose was to investigate whether alterations in mirna profile following pah exposure provides a better indicator of subsequent carcinogenic site-of-action than analysis of overall gene expression profile.

when the profiles of altered expression of  <dig> mirnas for the  <dig> organs were analysed by hierarchical clustering, the profiles appeared to be tissue specific. similar results have been reported in other studies  <cit> ; for example, liu et al.  <cit>  reported that  <dig> mirnas from humans and mice display tissue-specific expression signatures, and babak et al.  <cit>  found that more than half of  <dig> detected mirnas were expressed specifically in  <dig> adult mouse tissues.

an interesting finding was that the magnitudes of the expression differences in the deregulated mirnas were modest. the highest fold-changes were  <dig>  for mmu-mir- <dig> in colon  and  <dig>  for mmu-mir- <dig> in forestomach . 60% of the changes were smaller than 2-fold. a study in human breast cancer showed that over 90% of changes were 2-fold or less in  <dig> deregulated mirnas  <cit> . such small changes in human cancers are thought to be significant  <cit> . the importance of small changes can be explained if individual mirnas target many genes, and if the small changes can themselves significantly regulate individual target genes  <cit> . it has been shown that oncogenes and/or tumour suppressor genes may be disrupted dramatically by modulating mirnas in human cancers; for example, mir-16- <dig> and mir-15a negatively regulate bcl <dig> production and mir-17- <dig> cooperates with c-myc to stimulate proliferation  <cit> .

only two mirnas were modulated by more than 2-fold in mouse liver in the present study . in another study, in which male b6c3f <dig> mice received  <dig> daily doses of 150 mg/kg b.wt bap, the maximum fold change in a liver mirna detected by microarray analysis was  <dig> , but there were no changes in liver mirnas that were statistically significant  <cit> . a similar study of mirna expression changes induced in mouse liver by dibenzanthracene found that most changes were small  and that only one mirna that showed a dose-dependent increase  <cit> . thus although mirna response to environmental mutagens in liver may be a sensitive biomarker for liver carcinogens  <cit> , it does not appear to be very sensitive for bap, for which liver is a non-target organ in mice. yauk and co-workers also found that in mouse lung  <dig> mirnas were significantly modulated following  <dig> daily doses of  <dig> or 300 mg/kg b.wt bap  <cit> , but none of these were present in the microarray used in the present study .

the majority of mirnas in this study were up-regulated by bap. in this respect it is interesting that mirna expression levels in tumour samples appears to be globally lower than in normal tissues. for example,  <dig> of  <dig> measured mammalian mirnas were down-regulated in multiple human cancers  <cit> . calin et al.  <cit>  believe that these global mirna levels facilitate the proliferation and transformation of cells via oncogenes genes such as hras. on the other hand, mirnas can down-regulate gene expression during various critical cell processes including as apoptosis, differentiation and development  <cit>  and negatively regulate target mrnas  <cit> . the up-regulation of mirnas in the  <dig> organs may also be associated with the down-regulation of target genes.

mmu-mir-292-5p is predicted to target erbb <dig> . mmu-mir-292-5p was up-regulated in forestomach, colon and glandular stomach, and down-regulated in lung. this may explain the deregulation of erbb <dig> in these organs where erbb <dig> was down-regulated in forestomach, colon and glandular stomach but up-regulated in lung . however, confirmation of the interactions of mirnas and genes, such as mmu-mir-292-5p and erbb <dig>  needs further supporting evidence, e.g. confirmation of the modulation of mmu-mir-292-5p by bap with rt-pcr, identification of the mechanism of mmu-mir-292-5p binding to erbb <dig>  or rna interference to knock-out mirna functions, as in the studies of mirnas in carcinogenesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in an investigation of the early changes induced in mouse organs exposed to a carcinogen, we determined whether dna adduct formation, mrna or mirna expression can distinguish those mouse organs that are targets for bap carcinogenesis  from three organs that are non-targets . bap-dna adduct levels in mice did not distinguish target from non-target organs. mirna expression patterns were modulated by bap in a tissue-specific manner, and to a small extent. gene expression profiles have provided a portrait of the overall tissue-specific expressions of six organs. two target organs, lung and spleen, showed similar gene expression patterns which were different from the other four organs. p <dig> and stat <dig> activities may suggest the mechanism that distinguishes these two organs. conversely, there is little to distinguish the responses of the forestomach  from the glandular stomach . the modulation of cdh <dig>  ctnnb <dig> and apc indicates wnt/β-catenin activity specificity in non-target organs. bioinformatic approaches suggest that cell cycle, immune response, mapk signalling and wnt signalling play critical roles in bap carcinogenicity. studies that describe carcinogen-induced gene expression differences between a single target organ and a single non-target organ should be treated with caution.
