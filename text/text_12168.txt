BACKGROUND
gene conversion can impact the evolution of duplicated genes in a number of different ways including both impeding sequence divergence between genes and transferring variation between them  <cit> . gene conversion is a common mechanism of unidirectional homologous recombination in eukaryotes that results in a cut-and-paste like copying of sequence between similar alleles that are either at the same locus or at another locus in the same genome . concerted evolution can result from loci undergoing repeated gene conversion, which causes duplicated genes to evolve in tandem and not diverge from one another over evolutionary time. not all duplicated genes are subject to gene conversion, in fact, surveys in mammals and fruit flies suggest that only about ten percent of paralogous copies show signs of gene conversion, and only a small fraction of the total sequence length is typically impacted  <cit> .

duplicated genes that are experiencing concerted evolution typically will go through a series of phases of differential divergence. rates of gene conversion between sequences go down as the sequences become more dissimilar. for gene duplicates undergoing some level of concerted evolution, divergence between them will not begin to increase markedly until a threshold of sequence divergence is breached . models of this process suggest that there will typically be a long period of evolution with only low levels of divergence until a threshold level of divergence is passed at which point the rate of divergence will increase  <cit> . selective divergence can counter this homogenization and lead to the establishment and maintenance of regions of higher sequence divergence in the face of gene conversion if differences in specific regions of the gene between the two duplicates are adaptive . teshima and innan  <cit>  propose scanning for this specific pattern as a method of identifying such regions undergoing selection. using this method in a study in yeast, takuno and innan  <cit>  identified two sets of duplicated heat shock proteins that likely fit this model.

in addition to the role outlined above in slowing or countering adaptive divergence between duplicated genes, gene conversion can also play a role in transferring adaptive variation between duplicate genes. under such a scenario, gene conversion acts to increase the effective population size of the duplicated genes, making selection more efficient. this transfer can spread advantageous variation and remove deleterious mutations  <cit> . a number of studies have shown that gene conversion between duplicate genes with some degree of initial divergence between them can result in the introduction of high levels of variation at the converted locus  <cit> . for many of these cases, this variation appears to be adaptive with a number of these genes under selection for higher haplotype diversity .

the copepod tigriopus californicus has a set of unique features that makes it useful system in which to look at patterns of molecular evolution in duplicated genes. t. californicus exists in a series of extensively genetically divergent populations that have undergone substantial periods of independent evolution from one another. this species occurs in rocky upper intertidal pools along the pacific coast of north america from mexico to alaska. populations of this species can be highly genetically divergent from one another even over relatively short distances, with mitochondrial dna  divergences greater than  <dig> percent between populations  <cit> . divergence in the nuclear genome is lower but still substantial, likely reflecting a substantially higher rate of mutation for the mtdna  <cit> . even with these higher rates of mtdna evolution, the levels of divergence among populations suggest that these populations have been evolving fairly independently of one another for long periods of time. genomic resources are being developed for this species and now include published transcriptomes from a pair of populations, and these resources facilitate the characterization of paralogs  <cit> .

in this paper the molecular evolution of a set of aspartate transaminase-encoding homologs is examined in populations of t. californicus. a putatively mitochondrially targeted homolog was previously identified from this species  <cit>  and named after the corresponding allozyme locus . five additional homologs are described in this paper that have originated from a series of gene duplication events in the evolutionary lineage leading to this species. sequence similarity suggests that these genes are likely to be cytoplasmically targeted got <dig> proteins. two sets of somewhat more recently duplicated pairs of genes show strong evidence of gene conversion. in this paper the differential impact of gene conversion on the evolution of these two pairs of duplicated genes is examined.

RESULTS
identification of got paralogs
five new paralogous genes were identified from a pcr-based screen of expressed sequences from the copepod t. californicus that are homologous to genes encoding aspartate transaminase proteins . these genes were sequenced in four populations including three from southern california, san diego , la jolla , and abalone cove , and one from central california, santa cruz . four of these homologs, got1p1/got1p <dig> and got1sd/got1sr, had moderate levels of genetic divergence within pairs  but high levels of divergence between pairs . these two pairs are also highly divergent from the paralog got1_6a, with  <dig> percent and  <dig> percent amino acid identity between got1_6a and the got1p <dig> and got1sr proteins respectively. the got1p1/got1p <dig> proteins appear to be orthologous to other arthropod cytoplasmic got <dig> proteins . phylogenetic analyses clearly place the got1p1/got1p <dig> paralogs with other arthropod cytoplasmic got <dig> proteins and confirm the close relationship of the got1sd/got1sr proteins but do not consistently resolve the relationships of these two proteins and got1_6a with other organisms’ homologs . these three proteins fall basal to the other got <dig> homologs from animals, but this placement in not strongly supported in either bayesian or parsimony phylogenetic analyses.

levels of divergence in coding region are calculated for fixed differences  for ks  and ka  with a jukes-cantor correction. raw numbers of changes and sites can be found in additional file 2: table s <dig>  note that the got1sd sequences spanned only one-half of the coding region of got1sr  and that the reading frame was corrected when calculating numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions.

in addition to the large amount of amino acid divergence among the more divergent got <dig> paralogs, there are also a number of structural differences at these loci. the got1_6a gene and the got1sr genes each have four introns in the same positions in the gene . got <dig> also has four introns but only one of these shares a position with those of the got1_6a and got1sr genes . the size of this third intron varies widely from  <dig> bp in got1_6a to  <dig> bp for the scn population for got1sr . interestingly, the got1p1/got1p <dig> genes lack introns completely. the transcript for each of these genes is between  <dig> bp for got1sr and  <dig> bp for got1_6a, while the coding regions are all close to  <dig> bp . we did not obtain sequence corresponding to the first  <dig> bp of the coding region for the got1sd gene, but the sequenced portion is consistent with the presence of the final three introns. for the ab and ljs populations the second and third introns respectively have polymorphisms that would alter the predicted splice sequences for the got1sd gene.

five of these six got genes can be found in the published transcriptome dataset derived from the sd and scn populations of t. californicus <cit>  with only the got1sd gene missing. these data also give some hints as to the relative expression levels of these genes. total read numbers per gene are somewhat low overall in this  <dig> dataset but the highest counts were found for the got <dig> gene with  <dig> reads and the got1p1/got1p <dig> genes with  <dig> reads summed over both copies. examination of the proportion of reads from the diagnostic regions of the got1p1/got1p <dig> genes suggests that the expression of the got1p <dig> gene is about 6-fold higher than that of the got1p <dig> gene. the got1_6a and got1sr genes had fewer than  <dig> reads each suggesting that they are expressed at a much lower level. consistent with its absence from the transcriptomes, our lab found no expression of the got1sd gene using qualitative rt-pcr assays in the san diego  population, but we did find expression of both the got1sr and got1p1/got1p <dig> paralogs . sequences of mrna obtained from individual copepods from these experiments were identical to haplotypes obtained via direct sequencing from the coding regions.

divergence in got <dig> paralogs and gene conversion
the duplication events that produced the got1p <dig> and got1p <dig> paralogs and the got1sd and got1sr paralogs appear to have occurred in the tigriopus lineage prior to the split of the four populations examined in this study. this can be seen for the got1p <dig> and got1p <dig> paralogs in the higher levels of divergence between paralogs within a population as compared to the divergence between presumed orthologs between populations  and from phylogenetic analyses . in both of the got1p <dig> and got1p <dig> paralogs there are more synonymous substitutions than nonsynonymous substitutions between orthologous copies across populations and this is reflected in the low values of ka/ks . comparisons across paralogous copies within populations show the same pattern of relatively low ka/ks values . the number of nonsynonymous substitutions is higher across populations for the got1sd and got1sr paralogs with correspondingly higher ka/ks ratios . the got1sd and got1sr paralogs have not diverged substantially in the sequenced coding regions, but the third intron has diverged to the degree that much of it cannot be aligned between the paralogs .

it appears that a history of past and on-going gene conversion events has left a strong impression on the patterns of genetic variation within and among paralogs of got <dig> in t. californicus. using the program geneconv  <cit>  a series of inter- and intra paralog conversion events are evident . if we count non-overlapping predicted gene conversion events as a minimum number of gene conversion events, there have been at least two inter-paralog and one intra-paralog gene conversion events between got1p <dig> and got1p <dig> genes for sd and ljs populations . a minimum of two inter-paralog gene conversion events are also predicted for the ab population and one for the scn population with no intra-paralog events for either population . for the got1sd and got1sr paralogs there are a minimum of two inter-paralog gene conversion events predicted for the sd, ljs, and ab populations and one for the scn population. for this pair, intra-paralog gene conversion events are limited to the got1sd paralog, and there are at a minimum two of these for the scn population and one for the sd and ljs populations. also, for the got1sd and got1sr paralogs, the inter-paralog gene conversion events are largely restricted to the exons . the predicted intra-paralog gene conversion events for got1sd are all predicted to occur in this same intron . in contrast, for the got1p <dig> and got1p <dig> paralogs, there are no introns in the sequenced region of the gene, and the inter-paralog gene conversion events overlap primarily with the regions of low genetic divergence between paralogs. comparisons of got <dig> homologs from a range of arthropods and two vertebrates suggest that conserved amino acid regions are scattered across the protein and not centered only in the regions with evidence for gene conversion events . even for the regions with no genetic divergence between got1p <dig> and got1p <dig> paralogs from the same population, there is still some divergence among populations for each ortholog .

polymorphism capture via gene conversion
the sd and ljs got1p <dig> and got1p <dig> paralogs stand out for their elevated levels of polymorphism in comparison to other genes in these populations , and it appears that this pattern could stem from inter-paralog gene conversion events introducing variation. for these genes levels of synonymous polymorphism are nearly an order of magnitude higher than levels from other genes in these t. californicus populations, which had an average π value of  <dig>  for sd and  <dig>  for ljs across a set of eight nuclear-encoded genes  <cit> . the got1p <dig> genes in the sd and ljs populations also have a large number of nonsynonymous polymorphisms for the got1p <dig> paralog in addition to synonymous polymorphisms. for the peak of divergence at position  <dig>  alleles can differ by as many as eight nonsynonymous polymorphisms and fourteen synonymous polymorphisms. it appears that many of these polymorphisms are the result of gene conversion introducing variation from the got1p <dig> copy to the got1p <dig> copy as can be seen by examining patterns of divergence between alleles . phylogenetic analyses of each end of the gene also confirm this pattern of differential history for these sd and ljs got1p <dig> haplotypes . inspection of all of the sequences also suggests a number of other candidate snps that are likely to result from such inter-paralog events in these two populations and in the other two populations as well .

although there is evidence for inter-paralog gene conversion for the got1sd and got1sr paralogs as well, it does not appear to have been substantial enough to result in both copies retaining their open reading frames in all haplotypes. for the sd, ljs, and particularly scn populations there are fixed and polymorphic indels in exons in got1sd that should disrupt the reading frame and result in greatly truncated mrnas . in the ab population there appears to be a premature stop codon in the got1sr that is polymorphic in this population. for both the got1sr and got1sd paralogs elevated ka/ks ratios are seen for some comparisons further suggesting reduced functional constraint . for the got1p <dig> gene one haplotype in the sd population also had an insertion that would disrupt the reading frame suggesting that non-functional alleles can also be found at this locus. a one bp deletion was found in the coding region for a single haplotype in got1_6a in the sd population as well. only for the got1p <dig> gene copy were no such truncating or frameshift polymorphisms found in any of this set of four populations of t. californicus for these five got <dig> homologs.

discussion
i have identified a set of homologous genes from t. californicus that appear to encode aspartate transaminase proteins and these genes display a number of interesting patterns of inter-locus gene conversion. in discussing these results, first, i will discuss the potential deeper level relationships among these duplicates within and between species and then, second, i will look at the interesting patterns of gene conversion in two pairs of more closely related duplicates.

the cytosolic got <dig> proteins have undergone a number of gene duplication events in copepods and in the t. californicus lineage. the got1p1/got1p <dig> paralogs cluster phylogenetically with cytosolic got <dig> proteins in other species of arthropods and are their most likely orthologs. the relationships of the other three got <dig> paralogs to other got <dig> proteins are not resolved with the exception of a weakly supported relationship to putative got <dig> paralogs in two other distantly related copepod species . the lack of deeply divergent got <dig> paralogs in other sequenced metazoan genomes suggests that the duplication events producing the got1_6a and got1sd/got1sr paralogs may have occurred within copepods and were not the result of an ancient metazoan duplication event. other examples of older duplicates of aspartate transaminases in animals are restricted to individual clades such as mammals as can be seen in panther gene family trees http://www.pantherdb.org/ for aspartate aminotransferases  <cit> . if the duplications did occur within copepods, perhaps relatively high levels of amino acid divergence in these paralogs are obscuring their relationship to the other got <dig> proteins. regardless of the deeper level relationships, it is clear that the duplications that have resulted in the production of the got1sd/got1sr and got1p1/got1p <dig> gene pairs occurred more recently than these deeper splits. most likely these splits occurred in the common ancestor of these four populations of t. californicus given the presence of each copy in each population.

the got1p <dig> paralog is the most conserved of the five paralogs with no evidence for segregating non-functional alleles  and it has the highest levels of constraint as measured by ka/ks values . the higher expression level of the got1p <dig> copy, coupled with potential matches between predicted amino acid differences and allozyme allele differences among populations together suggest that the got1p <dig> paralog could be the same locus as the got <dig> allozyme used previously to examine genetic variation among t. californicus populations  <cit>  and may be the primary cytosolic aspartate transaminase protein in this species. the got1p <dig> paralog has slightly lower levels of constraint than the got1p <dig> paralog and has one haplotype that contains a frameshift polymorphism in this sample of sequences from the sd population. of the five paralogs, the got1sd gene is behaving the most like a pseudogene. it does not appear to be expressed at detectable levels and has a series of frameshift substitutions in each of the populations that disrupt the reading frame .

turning now to the patterns of gene conversion in the more recently duplicated pairs of paralogs, got1sd/got1sr and got1p1/got1p <dig>  it is clear that there has been gene conversion in the past within each pair. there is no evidence of gene conversion between the more divergent paralogs, e.g. between got1sr and got1_6a. there are numerous likely gene conversion tracks resulting from both inter- and intra-locus events between pairs for both of these sets of paralogs . for the got1sd/got1sr pair the inter-paralog gene conversion events are largely restricted to the exonic sequences with a large intron becoming largely un-alignable between paralogs. the got1sd gene appears to be evolving as a pseudogene in several populations as discussed above despite evidence for inter-locus gene conversion events with the largely intact got1sr gene. apparently these gene conversion events are not happening frequently enough to maintain the open reading frame of this got1sd copy in all populations. in contrast to the got1sd/got1sr pair of genes, there are no introns in the coding sequences of the got1p1/got1p <dig> paralogs and the regions of elevated divergence between the two paralogs are therefore located within the single exon. close physical proximity in the genome can facilitate interlocus gene conversion  <cit>  and in fact, the got1p1/got1p <dig> paralogs are tightly linked . the allozyme loci got <dig> and got <dig> were previously shown to be linked  <cit> , lending further credence to the idea that the got1p <dig> and/or got1p <dig> loci might encode the allozyme marker got <dig> that has been previously characterized in this species.

both pairs of paralogs got1sd/got1sr and got1p1/got1p <dig> show islands of genetic divergence amid regions of higher similarity but the evolutionary explanation for this pattern may differ between the two sets of duplicates. for the got1sd/got1sr pair the divergence is restricted to the introns and may be a result of the accumulation of substitutions that can terminate inter-paralog gene conversion in those stretches of the gene. divergence in sequence similarity that lowers the level of gene conversion could accumulate either via the gradual accumulation of single-base differences or more rapidly by larger changes such as large indels  <cit> . the got1sd/got1sr paralogs have both very large size differences and low sequence similarity in the intron so that either mode of divergence could have contributed to the absence of gene conversion in these regions. even small regions of clustered sequence divergence  can dramatically reduce the rate of gene conversion for a region of a gene  <cit> . the net result of this divergence for the got1sd/got1sr paralogs is that interlocus gene conversion is not likely to occur in this intronic region of the gene and these regions are free to accumulate further differences.

in contrast for the got1p1/got1p <dig> paralogs the regions of genetic divergence occur in the exons and there are no fixed indels in these regions that could disrupt interlocus gene conversion. teshima and innan  <cit>  have suggested that such regions of differentiation in the face of on-going gene conversion can be a signal that selection is maintaining divergence in the paralogs . under such a model the width of the divergent region should extend less than the average length of a gene conversion tract from the selected site or sites. a number of duplicated genes show such islands of divergence that are associated with clear functional differences in the resulting proteins . other duplicated genes in yeast and drosophila show a similar pattern consistent with selection but lack evidence for functional differences  <cit> . for the got1p1/got1p <dig> paralogs, one potential neutral explanation for this pattern could posit that gene conversion initiation is lower in these regions and that these regions have accumulated enough differentiation to begin to suppress gene conversion. an argument against this limited initiation idea is that intralocus gene conversion is common in the region of sequence differentiation between these two paralogs in the first half of the gene. this observation suggests that sequence factors are not completely suppressing the initiation of gene conversion events in the divergent regions of the gene. other factors that could also suppress interlocus gene conversion such as indel differences are also absent. the loss of fixed divergences between paralogs for one of these islands of genetic divergence in the sd and ljs populations in the second half of the gene  also argues that gene conversion is still possible for these regions. although these results are suggestive of a selective explanation, further study attempting to identify functional differences between the got1p1/got1p <dig> paralogs is needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.

a region of high polymorphism and lowered divergence between a set of alleles in the got1p1/got1p <dig> paralogs in the sd and ljs populations is likely to have been created by inter-paralog gene conversion. the patterns of variation and phylogenetic evidence  are consistent with one-way transfers of variation from each population’s got1p <dig> locus to the got1p <dig> locus. one-way exchange like this is consistent with other studies where gene conversion shows biased directionality  <cit> . the net result of this directional gene conversion is to transfer variants from one paralog to the other. in this case this transfer is limited to the second half of the gene resulting in haplotypes that are a chimera of the got1p <dig> and the got1p <dig> paralogs and this transfer also results in an increase in the levels of polymorphism in this region of the gene. the chimeric protein that results is substantially altered from that produced by other gotp <dig> alleles, differing by  <dig> amino acids, while still differing from gotp <dig> by  <dig> amino acid in the first half of the gene.

it is possible that gene conversion events that result in greatly augmented polymorphism in gene duplicates are effectively neutral, but in a number of other cases they appear to be under selection, often occurring in genes undergoing selection for diversification  <cit> . for the got1p <dig> and got1p <dig> genes there is not a clear signal of diversifying selection in comparisons of orthologous copies across populations with ka/ks values much lower than one . without any further functional information it is difficult to say whether the gene conversion events that resulted in greatly increased diversity in the got1p <dig> gene in the sd and ljs population are adaptive in nature. clearly this process has generated a large amount of novel variation at this locus both in dna and protein sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
the two sets of duplicate genes of got <dig> illustrate different patterns of evolution with ongoing gene conversion among duplicated copies. the set of got1sd/got1sr genes appear to be in the process of diverging with gradually decreasing gene conversion given that one copy does not maintain its open reading frame and does not appear to be expressed. the central intron in this gene is already quite divergent. in contrast for the got1p1/got1p <dig> pair, gene conversion is maintaining much higher similarity in some regions of the gene but other exonic portions are substantially diverged. the combination of these islands of genetic divergence between paralogs with rare gene conversion events has the ability to construct radically different haplotypes from the combination of variation in both paralogs . further work on the function of these two duplicates could help to determine whether there are likely to be adaptive differences between these copies.
