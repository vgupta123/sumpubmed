BACKGROUND
mango  belongs to the plant family anacardiaceae, which includes numerous tropical fruiting trees; it is native to south asia, from where it has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics, with significant economic importance  <cit> . high-quality fruits should be free of external damage, bruises, latex or sap injury, and decay. the storage life of mangoes is limited to  <dig> or 4 weeks at 10 - 15°c  <cit> , but production and postharvest practices, as well as novel technologies and packinghouse management, contribute greatly to retention of the fruit’s external quality throughout the worldwide supply chain  <cit> .

mango losses after harvest are caused by: harvesting at inappropriate stages of fruit maturity, mechanical damage during harvesting or through improper field handling, sap burn, discoloration of lenticels, fruit softening, chilling injury, and/or disease development and pest damage . two main factors affecting fruit quality are lenticel discoloration and postharvest disease  <cit> .

lenticel discoloration is a superficial blemish that affects some cultivars, imparting a speckled appearance to the fruits, which then are regarded as less desirable and are downgraded, although the speckled appearance does not affect fruit internal quality. blemish development is limited to the lenticel perimeter and the immediately adjacent area, and does not extend deeper than the outermost layers of the rind  <cit> .

postharvest diseases reduce fruit quality and result in severe losses  <cit> . in israel, the main postharvest disease is alternaria black spot , caused by the fungus alternaria alternata, which penetrates the fruit during its growth and is affected by the relative humidity in the orchard  <cit> ; following penetration, the fungus remains quiescent until fruit harvest and ripening  <cit> . stem-end rots that occur following long periods of storage are caused in israel, mainly by phomopsis mangiferae
 <cit> .

control of postharvest development of side rots caused by a. alternata, and stem-end rot caused by p. mangiferae, has been achieved by adopting a series of postharvest management practices, including hot-water brushing  for 15–20 s  <cit>  and, in some cases, application of acid prochloraz and waxing with a polyethylene emulsion  <cit> . this treatment enables commercially successful storage for 3– <dig> weeks at 12°c and ripening for an additional week at 20°c.

we recently demonstrated that hwb stresses the fruits and activates processes that could reduce fruit quality after storage  <cit> . the objective of the present study was to use gene-expression profiling to elucidate the biological mechanisms activated in mango by hwb and that mediate fruit quality and resistance to postharvest diseases. mango fruits of cultivar shelly were subjected to a commercial hwb procedure followed by a detailed transcriptomic analysis that used next-generation sequencing platforms. the differential gene-expression profiles of treated fruits indicated several transient hwb-regulated mechanisms, including: expression of host-resistance to pathogens related genes; transient decrease in the expression of chlorophyll catabolism- and photosynthesis; and a late decrease in the expression of genes that modulate processes related to glucose and flavonoid metabolism. the present data suggest fine control of the fruit response by the hwb exogenous treatment associated with packinghouse handling that may strongly modulate fruit quality during storage.

RESULTS
characterization of mango transcriptome assembly
the mango is a member of the family anacardiaceae and is an allotetraploid  fruit tree with a small genome size of about  <dig> mbp  <cit> . a new mango transcriptome was assembled from  <dig> -gbp sequence data  by using trinity  <cit>  software, which generated  <dig>  contigs with n <dig> of  <dig>  bases and an average length of  <dig>  bases . to identify the putative functions of assembled transcripts, a sequence-similarity search was conducted against the ncbi non-redundant  database by using a blastx search with a cut-off e value of 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  transcripts  showed significant similarity to known proteins in the nr database. based on the nr annotations,  <dig> % of the annotated sequences showed very high homology , and  <dig> % showed high homology . an additional  <dig> % showed homology  to available plant sequences . with respect to species,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the unique sequences had top matches to sequences from theobroma cacao and vitis vinifera, respectively, with additional hits to ricinus communis , populus trichocarpa , prunus persica , fragaria vesca  and cucumis sativus  . gene ontology   <cit>  was used to classify the functions of the predicted mango genes. based on sequence homology, a total of  <dig>  transcripts  could be categorized into one of three main categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function .figure  <dig>

profiling the expression of mango genes following hwb treatment
the variation in gene-expression profiles in mango fruit harvested at the mature-green stage was analyzed comparing the gene expression immediately after hwb , and at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after the treatment with those of untreated fruits at the same time points. both hwb and control fruits were stored at 12°c. two basic criteria were used to define differential gene expression: a twofold difference in transcript levels between treated and control fruits, and a p-value < <dig>  after false-discovery-rate  determination .

analysis of gene responses revealed a decrease in the number of differentially expressed genes from time  <dig> to 48 h: immediately after hwb treatment   <dig> genes were differentially expressed whereas 48 h later only  <dig> genes showed differential expression . venn diagrams  of the differential expression at the four different sampling times showed that most of differentially expressed genes are unique to one of the time points.

the expression patterns of  <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed in at least one time point were subjected to hierarchical clustering, which resulted in five main clusters , which then were visualized on a heat map . the first cluster contained  <dig> genes, and clusters  <dig> through  <dig> contained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes, respectively . the expression patterns shown in figures 4a and 4b indicate that, compared with their controls: cluster  <dig> showed increased transcript abundance at times  <dig> and 4 h and decreased abundance at times  <dig> and 48 h; cluster  <dig> was characterized by a transient increase in transcript abundance at time 0 h and decreases to almost no change at times  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h; cluster  <dig> showed transient up-regulation at 0 h and down-regulation at 17 h; cluster  <dig> was characterized by down-regulation of transcript abundance at  <dig> and 4 h, less marked down-regulation at 17 h, and almost returned to equal expression in treated and control fruits at 48 h after the treatment; cluster  <dig> showed an increased gene expression from time  <dig> to  <dig> which is maintained through 48 h.table  <dig>

analysis of over-represented gene ontology  terms in the subset of differentially expressed genes relative to the mango transcriptome database
each cluster was analyzed for its go-enriched profile using blast2go and fisher’s exact test . cluster  <dig>  was characterized by a transient increase in the expression of genes involved in defense against pathogens as well as in chitinase and amino-glycan activities . genes that possibly are involved in inhibition of fungal growth by direct modulation of host structural changes as well as by induced host resistance were selected for further analysis  <cit> . this suggests that the hwb treatment induces fruit responses similar to those observed to be induced following pathogen invasion and during induction of transient stress resistance.

cluster  <dig> were highly represented genes encoding for enzymes associated with flavanoid biosynthesis and metabolism, such as chalcone-flavanone isomerase family protein isoform  <dig>  and flavonol synthase flavanone 3-hydroxylase-like   <cit> . cluster  <dig> also included malic enzyme activity, such as nadp-dependent malic enzyme-like , that catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate  <cit> .

cluster  <dig> was enriched with genes associated with the cellular defense response and its regulation; in this cluster we found genes such as allene oxidase synthase   and syntaxin  <dig>   <cit> .

cluster  <dig> was enriched with genes involved in photosynthesis and chlorophyll catabolism, whose abundance decreased as sampling times increased from  <dig> through 17 h . among the genes with reduced expression, encoding for protein that might contribute to the reduction of chlorophyll level in the fruit were chlorophyll a-b binding protein chloroplastic-like    <cit>  and light-harvesting complex i protein   <cit> , which resides in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane; also in this cluster was the gene photosystem i reaction center subunit chloroplast    <cit> . cluster  <dig> was not enriched with any go classification term.

validation of differential gene expression
to validate the differential expression of specific genes identified by the rna-seq analysis, quantitative  rt-pcr analyses were performed for key genes of interest. mango genes belonging to the five different clusters of genes that were differentially expressed following hwb treatment were analyzed for their expression levels . chitinase  <dig>  and phenylalanine ammonia lyase   genes involved in chitinase activity and response to wounding were represented in cluster  <dig> . oxysterol binding protein   and inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase 2-like   genes involved in jasmonic acid stimulus were represented in cluster  <dig> . aos and syn  <dig> genes involved in negative regulation of cellular defense responses were represented in cluster  <dig> . lhciib and ent-kaurene oxidase   genes involved in photosynthesis and heme binding were represented in cluster  <dig> . salicylate o-methyltransferase   and peroxidase 15-like   genes were represented in cluster  <dig> . comparison with the results of the qrt-pcr analysis showed expression patterns that were significantly and consistently similar to those of the rna-seq analysis.figure  <dig> 
validation of rna-seq results by means of qrt-pcr. ten differentially expressed genes  were examined by rna-seq and qrt-pcr at four different time points after hwb treatment: a, b ; c, d ; e, f ; g, h ; and i, j . values were normalized to the values obtained with untreated mango fruit samples at 0 h and the proportional fold-change  was calculated. expression data are means of two replicates.



the relationships among mango fruit hwb-induced responses, disease resistance to a. alternataand the differential expression of genes of the different clusters
hwb treatment of freshly harvested fruits reduced the incidence of natural a. alternata infestation on fruits of cvs. palmer, kent, tommy atkins, keitt, lilly and shelly . hot water brushing treatment reduced the incidence of decay observed after 21 days of storage at 12°c by 64–84% , as also observed in citrus  and in peaches  <cit> . several genes  that are known to modulate the host pathogen-resistance mechanism, related to ja and sa, showed upregulation . syn <dig> gene showed significant differential expression . this gene is a member of the snare protein family that contributes to defense against fungal penetration  <cit>  and might be modulated by abiotic and biotic stress responses  <cit> . it acts as a regulator of sa, and may contribute to host resistance in the fruit. sa contributes to systemic acquired resistance   <cit>  through processes that activate the hypersensitive reaction response and increased production of reactive oxygen species . a second upregulated gene family in this group was that encoding glutaredoxin . glutaredoxin gene family is regarded as candidates for controlling the redox state of regulatory proteins  <cit> ; they interact with tga-transcription factors which are bzip plant transcription factors. these transcription factors contain a palindromic motif that is present in several plant promoters that are transcriptionally activated in response to elevated sa levels, and that negatively regulate the ja-inducible expression of defensin-like protein  <dig> . gutaredoxin is commonly used as a marker for ja-dependent defense responses  <cit> .figure  <dig>

together with syn <dig>  glutaredoxin and it1k <dig> all have a significant effect on the jasmonic acid stimulus  <cit>  suggesting that the mechanism of induced resistance include ja-defense responses. another major enzyme whose gene was upregulated was aos , which catalyzes the first step of conversion of linoleic acid to ja. a transient increase in aos expression has been observed in wounded leaves  <cit>  and it contributes to induced ja levels . changes in the metabolite content associated with the activities of ros-scavenging enzymes were also detected in heated citrus fruits, indicating a similar possible major cellular reorganization process in those fruits, in response to the heat treatment  <cit> .

aside from induction of host resistance, the presence of preformed antifungal alkylresorcinols such as resorcinol-5- and resorcinol-5-  <cit>  is also a key factor modulating fruit reisitance to postharvest pathogens. these compounds are fatty-acid derivatives obtained with specialized type iii polyketide synthases , which catalyze the formation of 5-alkylresorcinols by using fatty acyl-coa starter units and malonyl-coa extension units. the polyketide synthase  enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic ring-containing intermediates as the resorcinol mainly use an aldol-condensation-based mechanism  or a claisen-condensation-based mechanism  for ring folding  <cit> . a chalcone flavone isomerase involved in fatty-acid biosynthesis showed high expression at time 0 h after hwb, suggesting possible activation of this process by the inducing treatment.

effect of hwb on lenticel discoloration
lenticel discoloration results from stress induced by the hwb treatment, which leads to anthocyanin accumulation  <cit>  . four genes encoding udp-glucose flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase 3-like   – pal, chalcone-flavanone isomerase-like protein   and chalcone synthase   – related to the anthocyanin accumulation, phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways found in cluster  <dig> were tested by qrt-pcr . increased expression of these genes was clearly observed at the  <dig> and 4 h time points, followed by decreased expression at  <dig> and 48 h after the induction treatment. 1) ugft <dig>  was described to control anthocyanin synthesis in grapes  <cit> ; 2) pal, encodes one of the major enzymes involved in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in plants, and converts l-phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid, which is the precursor of the polyphenol compounds  <cit> ; 3) cfil is the second committed enzyme of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway which enhances flavonoid production and pigmentation  <cit>  4) chs, encoding chalcone synthase, which belongs to the pkss and is also known as a type iii pks  <cit> ; it catalyzes the initial step of flavonoid biosynthesis by converting 4-coumaroyl-coa and malonyl-coa to naringenin chalcone  <cit> . although these genes peaked relatively early  after the hwb treatment, we envision that they activate relevant processes modulating fruit-resistance at later stages of fruit life. similar phenylpropanoid pathway-expression pattern were described in heat treated peaches  <cit> , suggesting a wide mechanism of fruit responses to heat treatment.figure  <dig>

effect of hwb treatment on skin color change
one of the significant consequences of hwb treatment is the improved and enhanced color development on the fruit skin, which results from both anthocyanin production and inhibition of chlorophyll accumulation. the fruit color index of hwb-treated fruits was higher during all the period of fruit storage at  <dig> and 20°c . the index in untreated fruits increased from values of  <dig> , 16 days after harvest to  <dig> , 8 days later. during the same period the hwb-treated fruits showed an increase in color index to  <dig>  , indicating induction of a 31% increase in color level by the hwb treatment. the decreased expression of chlorophyll and anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes suggested that hwb played a role in the modulation of those processes . reduced expression of lhciib encoding for chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, one of the most abundant proteins in the chloroplast, which is important in the structure of photosynthesis reaction centers  <cit>  indicates a reduction in chlorophyll levels. other key genes that showed reduced expression included those encoding: the oxygen-evolving enhancer protein chloroplastic    <cit> ; pirc; and thioredoxin-like 1-chloroplastic  , in which the chloroplast thioredoxins have been suggested as mediators in the light-dependent regulation of chloroplast enzyme activity  <cit> .figure  <dig>

two genes related to anthocyanin accumulation – anthocyanin 5-aromatic   and udp-glycosyltransferase 85a2-like   – showed increased expression at the first two time points  after hwb, as detected by qrt-pcr . the anthocyanin5a modulates anthocyanin by aromatic acylation  <cit>  and 85a <dig> affects the level of glucosyl anthocyanidins in red fruit during ripening  <cit> . this suggests that different pathways are activated by hwb to modulate anthocyanin accumulation and to reduce processes associated with chlorophyll accumulation  <cit> , thereby enhancing color development.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, gene-expression profiling in mango skin revealed similarities in heat responses to those found in citrus and peach fruits  <cit> , with three major effects following hwb treatment: 1) a transient increase in expression of the stress- and pathogen-defense mechanisms-related genes; 2) a transient reduction in the expression of chlorophyll-related genes; and 3) increased expression of sugar and flavonoid metabolism related genes 4 h after treatment. these three main trends indicated by the observed hwb-induced modulation of gene expression can account for the major results of postharvest hwb treatment including: 1) induced resistance to a. alternata, attributed to the transient increase in the expression of genes involved in immune response and host resistance ; 2) improved color development observed after hwb which can be attributed to decreased photosynthesis, including reduction of chlorophyll accumulation after the treatment  and increased abundance of genes of flavonoid metabolism; and 3) enhanced lenticel discoloration that is also correlated with upregulation of flavanoid metabolism .

in light of the physiological changes described, the improved fruit quality acquired following heat stress is probably a result of various stress-response mechanisms that act coordinately to improve the fruit quality, prevent pathogen development, prevent cell damage and re-establish cellular homeostasis. genes identified in the present study that are modified in mango fruits following heat treatment, could have similar functions in other fruits such as citrus or peach.
