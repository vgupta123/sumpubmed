BACKGROUND
radiation hybrid  mapping is an important tool in the construction of high-resolution physical maps, which are key to efficient sequencing and successful genome sequence assembly  <cit>  and the construction of comparative maps between species  <cit> . a major advantage of rh mapping is that polymorphic and nonpolymorphic markers, including sequence tagged-sites , microsatellites , genes, expressed sequence tags , bacterial artificial chromosome  end sequences  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  can be ordered at high resolution. although several rh panels are currently available for swine  <cit> , to date, the imnprh <dig> -rad panel  <cit>  offers the highest mapping resolution and has been successfully used to order a variety of markers on swine chromosome  2p, 9p,  <dig>  <cit> , and over several chromosome regions, ssc6q <dig>   <cit> , ssc7q11- <dig>  <cit> , and ssc15q <dig>  <cit> . current rh maps of ssc <dig> are built on the imprh <dig> -rad panel  <cit>  where map resolution and marker density are unfortunately not optimal for either fine-mapping qtls or genome sequence assembly. map discrepancies between various rh maps or between rh and the corresponding genetic map also exist  <cit> . therefore, an integrated, high-resolution rh and comparative map for ssc <dig> should help in resolving discrepancies.

ssc <dig> is a small metacentric chromosome, comprising ~ <dig> %  of the pig haploid genome. sequencing of ssc <dig> by the international swine genome sequencing consortium  and pig genome sequence project  is based on the bac fingerprinted contig  map  and the bes rh map  <cit> , which was built on the imprh <dig> -rad panel. an initial draft assembly of ssc <dig> sequence has recently been released in pre-ensembl , but only contains ~ <dig> mb, roughly one-third of the entire chromosome. here we report the generation of an initial high-resolution rh map of ssc <dig> that integrates the imprh <dig> -rad, imnprh <dig> -rad rh, porcine genetic and bac fpc maps, and allowed us to construct a comparative map of ssc <dig> and hsa <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

RESULTS
ssc <dig> rh <dig>  and rh <dig>  maps
two sets of mapping vectors from the imnprh <dig> -rad and the imprh <dig> -rad panels were used to construct the rh fw map of ssc <dig>  the vectors were merged into one data-set and analyzed using a maximum multipoint likelihood linkage strategy with carthagene  <cit>  at a  <dig> pt lod score of  <dig>  two linkage groups were initially identified for ssc <dig> . one linkage group was assigned to the short arm , the other group to the long arm   based on known mss and ests/genes from previous genetic and rh maps  <cit> . a fw map for each linkage group was built simultaneously on both rh panels at a likelihood ratio of 1000: <dig>  the orientation of each linkage group was based on markers previously assigned to the porcine cytogenetic  and genetic maps . a total of  <dig> fw markers common to the imprh <dig> -rad  and imnprh <dig> -rad  fw maps were ordered on ssc <dig> . the accumulated map distance of ssc <dig> was  <dig>  cr <dig>  on the imprh <dig> -rad and  <dig>  cr <dig>  on the imnprh <dig> -rad fw maps. this represents a  <dig>  fold increase in map resolution over the imprh <dig> -rad panel , which is consistent with our previous observations on ssc2p, 9p and  <dig>   <cit> , and within the  <dig> – <dig>  fold range reported on ssc6q <dig>   <cit> , ssc7q11- <dig>  <cit> , and ssc15q <dig>  <cit> . if we assume the dna content of ssc <dig> is ~ <dig> mb  <cit> , then the kb/cr ratio is ~ <dig>  for the imnprh <dig> -rad fw map, and  <dig> kb/cr in the imprh <dig> -rad fw map, close to the genome average of  <dig> kb/cr <dig>  reported for the imnprh <dig> panel  <cit> , and slightly better than the  <dig>  kb/cr <dig>  genome average reported for the imprh <dig> -rad panel  <cit> . in the second generation pig est rh <dig> -rad map  <cit> , ssc <dig> had the lowest resolution  of the entire genome with a ratio of  <dig>  kb/cr <dig> , based on an earlier estimate of ~ <dig> mb for ssc <dig>  <cit> . as chromosome size estimates  alone cannot account for the reported lower resolution in these initial reports, a lower marker density and difficulty in mapping within the nucleolus organizer region  must be considered .

* number of marker was the sum of fw and non-fw markers in both rh <dig>  and rh <dig>  maps .

** fold change was calculated by dividing the map distance in the  <dig> -rad fw map by the map distance in the  <dig> -rad fw map.

*some of the markers in each linkage group are not common markers to both rh panels, leading to the total number of markers in this table being greater than  <dig> 

we used the carthagene software  <cit>  to integrate  <dig> additional, non-fw markers  into the imnprh <dig> -rad fw map. they are listed to the right of the fw map in fig. 1d . if counting the fw and non-fw markers together, we achieved an average density of  <dig>  kb per marker  on ssc <dig>  a significant increase in marker density over the ~ <dig>  mb/marker reported for the most current ssc <dig> rh <dig> -rad est and bes maps  <cit> .

when marker density on ssc10p and ssc10q was analyzed separately, there was a significant difference in map resolution between the two arms. the standard porcine karyotype, places the ssc <dig> arm ratio  at  <dig>   <cit>  with the dna content of ssc10p estimated at  <dig>  mb , and ssc10q at  <dig>  mb. the kb/cr ratio of ssc10p and ssc10q would be  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the imnprh <dig> -rad, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the imprh <dig> -rad panels, respectively. this suggests that map resolution on ssc10p was lower than that of the genome averages in both panels, whereas ssc10q was higher than the genome average  <cit> . there are two possible explanations for this finding. one is marker density, which is lower in ssc10p . rh fw map length for a given region is influenced by marker density; the higher the marker density, the longer the map length ; thus, the higher the map resolution. a second is the localization of the nors, or the ribosomal rna genes  on ssc10p near the centromere  <cit> . ssc <dig> is one of two chromosomes  in the porcine genome that harbors ribosomal rna genes  in nors located in the proximal region of ssc10p near the centromere. silver-staining  indicates that the porcine rnr genes on ssc <dig> are constitutively active in all pig breeds, while their activity on ssc <dig> varies among different pig breeds  <cit> . the ratio of fw vs. non-fw markers was 1: <dig>  in the nor region , significantly biased from the average 1: <dig>  on ssc <dig> suggesting that building an accurate map for this region will be difficult. the swine bac fpc map is also not contiguous over the same region . in the human genome, there are between  <dig> and  <dig> copies of ribosomal rna gene per haploid genome, that map to the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . unfortunately, the copy number of the porcine rnr gene on ssc <dig> is currently unknown, which limits our ability to specifically define the extent of the nor.

it is also worth noting that a pair of markers for five genes  was typed separately on the imnprh <dig> -rad panel. as shown in fig. 1c and 1d, all five-paired markers mapped next to each other within a small interval. since the paired markers were designed from different laboratories  and typed anonymously, they provide an additional indication of the resolution and accuracy of the imnprh <dig> -rad ssc <dig> map  <cit> .

integration of ssc <dig> rh and genetic maps
thirty-six of  <dig>  mss ordered on the imnprh <dig> panel were mapped on the latest ssc <dig> genetic map  , of which  <dig> are fw markers,  <dig> are non-fw markers, and the remaining  <dig> are singletons  . the order of all fw and non-fw ms, except for swr <dig> on the ssc <dig> rh map, is in agreement with the order on the genetic map . in addition, the five bins , each with two to five mss, on the genetic map  of ssc <dig>   were all ordered on the imnprh <dig> -rad map , significantly increasing the resolution on the genetic map.

however, two small regions of ssc <dig> did not completely align with the genetic map. the first is the nor-centromere region. the four singleton mss   were all located in this region. the second region is close to ssc10qter between sw <dig> and sw <dig>  where there is a gap between fpc contigs  <dig> and  <dig>  we determined ms swr <dig> and sw <dig> were flipped when compared to the genetic map . in previous studies, swr <dig> and sw <dig> were reversed  <cit> , while the order of sw <dig> and sw <dig> was reversed in the imprh <dig> -rad maps for ssc <dig> reported by aldenhoven et al.  <cit>  and rink et al.  <cit> , indicating the difficulty in assigning marker order within this region.

integration of ssc <dig> rh and bac fpc maps
when the ssc <dig> rh map was integrated with the corresponding bac fpc maps based on common bes , a total of  <dig> bac contigs  were identified. contigs 10001– <dig> cover ssc10p, while contigs 10006– <dig> cover the entire ssc10q  with the order of bess in the current rh map identical to the fpc map for the entire chromosome  except for the two small regions also encountered in the genetic map. we estimate the  <dig> singleton mss  in the genetic map, the nor and centromere region of ssc <dig> cover ~ <dig>  cm   with the nor between  <dig> cr <dig> -rad and  <dig> cr <dig> -rad  where several small bac fpcs including contig  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are assigned. there were two "free" bes markers found between contigs  <dig> and  <dig> in the rh map . one was 309b11e <dig>  which mapped to the middle of the large fpc contig  <dig> . the other was 287a21g <dig>  for which no information is available in the bac fpc database. it is worth noting that since neither rh mapping nor bac fingerprinting were able to accurately map the nor region, more attention should be paid to marker assignment and sequencing in this "problematic" region.

the order of three non-fw bess  at the end of bac contig  <dig> was also inverted . four fw mss, sw <dig>  sw <dig>  sw <dig> and sw <dig> are located in this region where discrepancies between the genetic and rh maps were previously reported  <cit> . carthagene identified two likely fw map orders for this region, with only a slight statistical difference in log10-likelihood . one order was crem-estar068b09-sw305-sw1708-sw951-sw <dig>  the alternative order was sw951-sw1708-sw305-estar068b09-crem-sw <dig>  the final rh map  was built according to the first order based on the assumption that marker order in the genetic map  was correct. however, adoption of the alternative order would not invert the three non-fw bess in contig  <dig>  at present, we are unable to resolve whether the genetic or the fpc map is correct without additional markers.

comparative map between ssc <dig> and hsa  <dig>  and  <dig> and 10
all gene, est, and bes sequences were blat  and blast  searched against the human genome sequence  to identify regions of synteny between the human and porcine genomes . the coordinates of  <dig> markers based on their positions in the current ssc <dig> rh map and their sequence locations in hsa <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  the pig-human comparative map  built in this work, not only supports the previous findings by bidirectional fluorescence in situ hybridization  that ssc <dig> is in synteny with regions of hsa <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , but also refines the conserved synteny blocks between the two species. five synteny blocks are conserved between ssc10p and the distal region of hsa1q  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb . however, ssc10q shares regions of synteny with two other human chromosomes, hsa <dig> and hsa <dig>  two blocks of conserved synteny were identified between the proximal region of ssc10q  and hsa9p <dig> - <dig>   and hsa9q <dig> - <dig>  , while six blocks were identified between the distal region of ssc10q  and the entire hsa10p   , reflecting the macro-rearrangements that occurred during the evolution of the two species. in addition, several micro-rearrangements such as those observed on ssc <dig>  ssc2p and 9p  <cit>  were also identified. for example, the fbp <dig>  gene located on hsa10q  did not map to the conserved region between ssc <dig> and hsa <dig>  but to the region where ssc <dig> and hsa <dig> are conserved at  <dig>  cr/ <dig>  mb . it is reasonable to assume that the map position of fbp <dig> in ssc <dig> is an indication  of an inversion in the region  between fbp <dig> and ctsl <dig>   during the evolution of ssc <dig> which may include the entire centromere. two bess, 309a10g <dig> at  <dig>  cr/ <dig>  mb and 404b2d <dig> at  <dig>  cr/ <dig>  mb, were also not aligned with their synteny blocks. further characterization of regions of conserved synteny as well as micro-rearrangements between pig and human should improve our understanding of mammalian genome evolution and assist in swine genome sequencing and assembly.

gene density across a genome of any mammalian species is not uniform with some human and swine chromosomes described as "gene-rich", and others as "gene-poor"  <cit> . the first- and second-generation porcine est rh maps  <cit>  suggested that ssc <dig> had less than the expected number of genes based on dna content  <cit> . however, none of the corresponding human chromosomes/regions  are listed as "gene-poor" in the human genome  <cit> . this inconsistency in gene density within homologous regions of the pig and human genome may be explained by two factors. the size of ssc <dig> may have been over-estimated as the initial report of  <dig> mb for ssc <dig>  <cit>  used in subsequent reports  <cit>  has been revised to ~ <dig> mb  <cit> . alternatively, the nor region contains a large number of tandem repetitive dna sequences and harbors multiple copies of the rnr genes that is likely to confound the estimate of gene density.

CONCLUSIONS
we merged mapping vectors from the imnprh <dig> -rad and the imprh <dig> -rad panels to construct the highest resolution fw rh and comparative map for ssc <dig>  to date, containing a total of  <dig> markers. average map resolution was  <dig>  kb/cr <dig>  or  <dig>  kb per marker on ssc <dig>  although the proximal region of ssc10p  remains a difficult target for physical as well as linkage mapping, the current map provides a platform to integrate additional sts from the wealth of data submitted to the imnprh <dig> -rad and imprh <dig> -rad, genetic and bac fpc maps. this should improve our ability to identify breakpoints and micro-rearrangements and close potential gaps between bac contigs prior to sequencing and assembly, as well as provide a useful starting point for higher resolution mapping of qtls including those for meat quality, growth, feed intake and reproductive traits  <cit>  on this chromosome.
