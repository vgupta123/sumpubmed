BACKGROUND
infections with stenotrophomonas maltophilia are increasingly encountered especially in debilitated or immune suppressed patients  <cit> . nosocomial infections of the respiratory, urinary, central nervous, musculoskeletal, skin-soft tissue systems and of the gastrointestinal tract, and bacteremia, endocarditis and eye infections occur in sensitive individuals  <cit> .

s. maltophilia is inherently resistant to many antimicrobials. additional resistance develops against cephalosporins and aminoglycosides because of decreased outer membrane permeability and via at least two types of beta-lactamases  <cit> . recently, resistance to floroquinolones via efflux system has been reported  <cit> . also, antimicrobial susceptibility tests for s. maltophilia have not been so far fully standardized  <cit> . these problems raise difficulties for the choice of antimicrobials in s. maltophilia infections.

in this study, disc diffusion and e-test methods were compared with the agar dilution method in s. maltophilia strains against seven different antimicrobials. we also investigated the genetic relatedness of s. maltophilia isolates by the arbitrarily primed pcr .

RESULTS
s. maltophilia strains were mostly isolated from the lower respiratory tract , and from urine  and blood  samples, and the majority were from the clinics of paediatrics , neurology , nephrology , chest diseases  and intensive care units . only six strains were isolated in 1998; however the isolation rate steadily increased throughout the years and reached  <dig> strains in  <dig>  in particular, the annual isolation rate in the clinics of paediatrics and neurology was only one or two until  <dig>  however it increased to six in  <dig> and five in  <dig> in paediatrics. also, six strains were isolated in neurology in  <dig> 

although trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  and ciprofloxacin  have the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration  values, the most effective antimicrobials were sxt and ticarcillin/clavulanate , which was in accordance with the breakpoints established by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards . the rate of susceptibilities obtained by the disc diffusion and e-test methods were similar to the agar dilution test; however, false susceptibility for cip by both tests  and for tlc by the e-test were obtained  . the disc diffusion and e-test methods showed a good agreement with agar dilution method for sxt . rates of correlations were poor for the other antimicrobials.

a total of  <dig> different patterns of  <dig> strains were obtained by the arbitrarily primed pcr . three small clusters were observed. all of five strains in pattern l were isolated in the neurology clinic between march and september  <dig>  all three strains in pattern ll were isolated in the paediatrics clinic between january and march  <dig>  and three strains in pattern lll were isolated in the paediatrics, nephrology and chest diseases clinics between january and november  <dig>  the antimicrobial susceptibility results supported the ap-pcr method for patterns l and ll, but not for pattern iii. the strains in pattern i were resistant to ceftazidime , cefepime , piperacillin  and piperacillin/tazobactam , and susceptible to tlc, cip, and sxt. the strains in pattern ii were susceptible to all antimicrobial except for cip. the dendrogram showed a dice similarity coefficient ranging from <dig>  to 100% .

discussion
s. maltophilia has low pathogenicity, but it has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen. patients infected with s. maltophilia usually have underlying immunodeficiency or history of long-term or multiple hospitalizations, exposure to invasive devices and/or broad spectrum antimicrobials  <cit> . this organism, most frequently, causes lower respiratory and urinary tract infections and may result in secondary bacteremia  <cit> . our results supported these observations.

according to the recommendations of the nccls  <cit> , agar dilution method should be used in order to detect antimicrobial susceptibility of s. maltophilia strains. since the dilution methods are more cumbersome or expensive than the disc diffusion or e-test methods in routine clinical microbiology laboratories, the aim of this study was to compare the performance of these latter methods with agar dilution method.

the nccls had not defined the criteria for disc diffusion method for s. maltophilia by the year  <dig>  so, breakpoints for other bacteria from the nccls comments have been tried to be adapted in various studies  <cit> . the best correlated results have been obtained with those recommended for pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . in  <dig>  the nccls recommended disc diffusion breakpoints for minocycline, levofloxacin, and sxt. nevertheless, we tested other antimicrobials frequently used in nosocomial infections and interpreted these antimicrobial susceptibilities using the nccls criteria established for p. aeruginosa.

our results showed that the most effective antimicrobials against s. maltophilia were sxt and tlc, as observed by several authors  <cit> . nevertheless, the resistance rates for other antimicrobials in our study were extremely high. resistance to beta-lactams in s. maltophilia is primarily intrinsic and mediated by inducible beta-lactamases  that hydrolyses virtually all classes of beta-lactams  <cit> . although many authors have tested piperacillin  and cefepime against s. maltophilia, they are not suitable for the treatment of s. maltophilia infections. l <dig> beta-lactamase is susceptible to clavulanic acid, so tlc is preferred to ptz  <cit> . however, carrol et al.  <cit>  determined that there was an obvious increase in the level of resistance to tlc when they prolonged the susceptibility tests up to  <dig> hours. this finding makes the in vitro efficiency of tlc disputable. the nccls has recently recommended 20– <dig> hours incubation for s. maltophilia, and so we did not evaluate the tests after  <dig> hours incubation  <cit> .

the correlations between in vitro susceptibility methods for s. maltophilia show variations  <cit> . while nicodemo et al.  <cit>  stated that the disc diffusion tests have an excellent correlation with agar dilution for several antimicrobials; pankuch et al.  <cit>  used the breakpoint values for enterobacteriaceae recommended by the nccls and found a high level of discordance for ptz, tlc, cip. also, in our study, poor agreement was observed in the alternative test methods except for sxt. in a study where the correlation of e-test with agar dilution method for  <dig> antimicrobials in  <dig> clinical isolates were investigated, the authors found an excellent correlation and recommended e-test as an alternative susceptibility test  <cit> . major and very major errors were very low in this latter study and were similar to our results for all the antimicrobials except for cip and caz by both the disc diffusion and by the e-test. however most of the discordant susceptibility rates among the three methods evaluated were due to high occurrence of minor errors in our study. the mic values of our strains cumulated close to breakpoints. for instance, the susceptibility breakpoint of cip established by the nccls is  <dig> mg/l  <cit>  and equals to mic <dig> value of our strains. moreover mic values for cip were  <dig> mg/l and  <dig> mg/l of  <dig> and  <dig> strains, respectively. the same applies for caz and cpm also. therefore, minor variations caused to change in the susceptibility categories from intermediate susceptibility to susceptibility or resistance or vice versa. if variations in ±  <dig> doubling dilutions between different methods were to be accepted as essential agreement suggested by pankuch et al  <cit>  then our error rates would have been much more smaller.

tracking of s. maltophilia isolates has a great importance to reveal their outbreaks, to determine the distribution routes and to take preventive measures. however, biotyping and antibiotyping methods are not reliable due to the relative metabolic inactivity and multiresistance of these isolates. more recently, genotypic methods have been developed and used with success to discriminate for phenotypically indistinguishable bacteria. ap-pcr is one of the most preferred molecular typing methods for this aim, because the results can be obtained rapidly even in a clinical laboratory. also, it can be applied to a wide range of bacterial species by using almost the same materials and equipment  <cit> . we determined two small outbreaks consisting of five cases in the neurology and three cases in the paediatrics clinics by using ap-pcr method. isolation dates, clinics, and antibiotyping data have also supported these results. on the other hand, the third cluster  suggests that the same strain can persist for a long time in hospital. the first strain from pattern iii were isolated from the pediatrics clinic in january  <dig>  the second and third strains were isolated from the nephrology clinic in august  <dig> and from the chest diseases clinic in november  <dig>  respectively. reported nosocomial outbreaks due to s. maltophilia are generally short termed.  <cit> . there is no report of prolonged transmission extending up to  <dig> months for s. maltophilia. valdezate et al  <cit>  concluded that the epidemiological relationship among different s. maltophilia isolates needed to be analysed because unexpected results could be obtained. antibiotic susceptibility profiles also supported that isolates in pattern iii were independent isolates having same genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the disc diffusion and the e-test methods were unreliable alternative methods for s. maltophilia, except for sxt. however, significance of these data should be confirmed by further experimental and clinical studies.
