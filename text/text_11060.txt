BACKGROUND
olive knot disease is a plant disease characterized by hyperplastic symptoms mainly on twigs, young branches and the trunk, more rarely on leaves and fruits, of olive trees , which exists worldwide wherever this crop is cultivated. this disease is particularly damaging as far as quantitative and qualitative production is concerned  <cit> , and causes heavy losses in the countries of the mediterranean basin where olive plants are extensively cultivated. the causal agent is the plant pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi   <cit> , isolated and described for the first time by luigi savastano  <cit> . psv enters and infects plants generally through wounds of different origin   <cit> . the pathological process depends on the expression of bacterial hrp genes  <cit> , and the development of the spherical knots is caused by phytohormones  synthesized by psv, that trigger uncontrolled proliferation of the cells surrounding the site of infection  <cit> . in the species p. savastanoi were also included isolates from oleander , ash  and other plants, such as privet , jasminum spp. and retama sphaerocarpa  l., and the taxonomy and the classification of this bacterium have been controversial for a long time. the strains isolated from olive, oleander and ash can be differentiated according to a series of characteristics concerning host range, production of phytohormones and bacteriocins, assimilation of different carbon sources, monoclonal antibodies, analysis of whole cell fatty acids, dna relatedness, low molecular weight restriction fragments, restriction fragment length polymorphism  and fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> . moreover the genetic diversity of strains isolated from olive trees was recently deeply investigated  <cit> . according to all these data, the name psv is now used to indicate isolates from olive, while the names p. savastanoi pv. nerii  and p. savastanoi pv. fraxini  are accepted for those strains isolated from oleander and ash, respectively  <cit> .

the strategies to control olive knot mainly aim to reduce the spread of the disease, with general cultural practices such as pruning, particularly of affected branches, and the conventional use of copper compounds. up to now no commercial olive cultivars resistant to psv are available yet, but some researches on this topic have been reported  <cit> . sources of inoculum for new infections are represented by psv populations surviving within the young knots, but also by psv naturally resident on healthy olive trees as epiphyte on the phylloplane, on the surfaces of stems and olive fruits. psv epiphytic populations are important sources of inoculum for new infections, and their density is related to the season and the age of leaves, with the greatest damages observed when weather conditions were conducive both for the growth of psv as epiphyte and its entry into the olive bark  <cit> . thus, also considering the increasing spread of resistance to copper compounds among p. syringae pathovars and related bacteria  <cit> , sensitive and specific methods to monitor psv natural epiphytic population on olive trees are needed to contribute to the successful preventive control and management of this disease. moreover, psv is among the infective agents of olive, whose absence has to be ascertained for the production of certified olive plants  <cit> .

traditional microbiological methods for the detection and identification of psv are available  <cit> , but they have low sensitivity and specificity, and they are quite time consuming. for this reason some protocols were developed for the detection of psv, by conventional, enriched and nested pcr, working also in planta and in asymptomatic tissues  <cit> . these assays showed high levels of sensitivity, but they were unsuitable to accurately and reliably quantify the target phytopathogen. moreover all these assays, as well as a sensitive and quantitative real-time pcr procedure developed for psn detection in oleander plants  <cit> , used primers designed on the sequence of iaal gene, which encodes the conversion of iaa to iaa-lysine. but being this target common to all the isolates of psv, psn and psf, none of these methods results to be pathovar-specific, while it is known that under experimental conditions psn strains are able to infect olive  <cit> , and that psf strains are able to multiply in olive bark when artificially inoculated, although to a lower level than strains isolated from olive or oleander  <cit> . since nothing is known yet about their distribution in nature on the different host plants and whether spontaneous cross-infections occur, pathovar-specific molecular protocols for the discrimination of psv, psn and psf would be urgently needed, firstly to clarify this aspect of their epidemiology and then to avoid false positive results derived from the application of the above mentioned detection methods in sanitary certification programmes.

in this paper we describe the development of reliable pcr-procedures for the specific discrimination and quantification of psv, psn and psf, both in vitro and in planta as epiphytes, by end point pcr and real-time pcr, using two different technologies, the sybr® green i detection dye and three pathovar-specific taqman® hybridisation probes. primers and probes specific for psv, psn and psf were designed upon the sequence data of cloned fragments, previously amplified in repetitive-sequence-based pcr  experiments with strains belonging to the three pathovars of p. savastanoi examined in this study using enterobacterial repetitive intragenic consensus  primers  <cit> . these procedures have high sensitivity, specificity, rapidity and represent valid and innovative diagnostic tools that can suit all phytopathological laboratories, according to their equipment and skills, in order to promote and encourage the use of molecular detection methods for psv in the frame of the certification programs for olive propagation materials.

RESULTS
identification of p. savastanoi pathovar-specific sequences by eric-pcr and design of pathovar-specific primers
the identities of p. savastanoi strains shown in table  <dig> were confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing and pathogenicity trials . on these strains, rep-pcr experiments with eric1r and eric <dig> primers were performed and the results referring to some representative strains for each p. savastanoi pathovar examined are shown in figure  <dig>  the genomic eric-pcr profiles were highly reproducible; they consisted of bands ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and were pathovar-specific. for each p. savastanoi pathovar at least a single and unique band, appearing in all the strains belonging to the same pathovar, was detected. the sizes were approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  bp in psv, psn and psf, respectively . these pathovar-specific bands were then separately isolated and purified from agarose gels, cloned and analyzed for their nucleotidic sequences composition. each band was demonstrated to consist of several fragments of the same size but having different nucleotidic sequences, which were then individually dig-labeled and used as probes in dot blot hybridization experiments performed under high stringency with the genomic dnas of psv, psn and psf previously blotted to nylon film . the sequences assessed to be pathovar-specific in hybridization experiments were then analyzed using the blastn and blastx softwares, and further comparisons were made with the clustalw <dig> program. according to the data so obtained and concerning their specificity, three eric-derived clones were selected, one for each pathovar . clone fm <dig> from psn did not show any significant homology with any nucleotidic or aminoacidic sequence present in the main databases. clone fm <dig> from psv had a quite significant homology  near its 3' end with putative transcriptional regulators belonging to the tetr family, while no homology was ever detected with any nucleotidic sequence. on the contrary, clone fm <dig> from psf showed a significant homology both in blastx and blastn analysis  with sequences related to proteins belonging to the so called "vird4/trag family" of type four secretion system  <cit> . by hybridization experiments clones fm <dig> and fm <dig> were demonstrated to be located on bacterial chromosome, while clone fm <dig> was located on a plasmid of about  <dig> kb . these three clones were further analysed in order to identify for each of them conserved regions specifically present in all the strains of the same pathovar, then used to design pathovar-specific primers and probes for end point and real-time pcr .

end point pcr assays for psv, psn and psf specific detection
in order to obtain information about their specificity and sensitivity, the primer pairs psvf/psvr, psnf/psnr and psff/psfr, whose sequences and descriptions are reported in table  <dig>  were evaluated in end point pcr assays using as template the genomic dna of strains psv itm <dig>  psn itm <dig> and psf ncppb <dig>  which are representative of their pathovars. for each primer set several serial tenfold dilutions of genomic dna  of the isolate belonging to the pathovar for which that primer pair was supposed to be specific were used as template. genomic dnas  extracted from each one of the other two p. savastanoi isolates, from olive, oleander, ash and oak, and from pooled samples of bacterial epiphytes isolated from these plants were also tested. the results obtained are shown in figure  <dig>  where 1/ <dig> of the reaction volume for each sample tested was loaded onto the agarose gel, to better compare the data. a single amplicon was produced with each primer pair of the three tested, specifically when the dna template was from the p. savastanoi pathovar for which the primer set was designed. the size of each amplicon was as expected:  <dig> bp for psvf/psvr,  <dig> bp for psnf/psnr and  <dig> bp for psff/psfr, with dna template from strains psv itm <dig>  psn itm <dig> and psf ncppb <dig>  respectively. no amplicons were ever obtained with no target dna, either from olive, oleander, ash and oak or from the pools of bacterial epiphytes from p. savastanoi host plants. the sensitivity of these pcr assays was estimated by determining the lowest amount of dna template detected, that was found to be approximately  <dig> pg for the primer sets psnf/psnr and psff/psfr, and  <dig>  pg for the pair psvf/psvr, here corresponding to dna concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  pg/μl, respectively .

for further testing the pathovar-specificity of the end point pcr detection methods developed in this study, genomic dnas from the bacteria listed in table  <dig> were also assayed . forty-four p. savastanoi strains, belonging to three p. savastanoi pathovars here examined and having different geographic origins, were tested. for comparison, strains 1449b of p. savastanoi pv. phaseolicola  and pg <dig> p. savastanoi pv. glycinea , taxonomically closely related to the pathovars of our interest, were also included in this study. in table  <dig> the results obtained are schematically reported: the signs + and - indicate the presence or absence of the expected amplicons, respectively. the pathovar-specificity of each primer pair was confirmed and all the strains belonging to a pathovar were correctly identified when tested with the primer set supposed to be specific for that pathovar. no unspecific amplifications were ever generated, confirming that these end point pcr assays are highly specific and able to discriminate strains belonging to psv, psn and psf.

sybr® green real-time pcr assays for psv, psn and psf specific detection
on the eric pathovar-specific sequences and internal to the annealing sites for the end point pcr primers, three primer sets to be used in real-time pcr were designed, one for each p. savastanoi pathovar examined. the specificity of these primer pairs, named psvrt-f/psvrt-r, psnrt-f/psnrt-r, psfrt-f/psfrt-r , was preliminarily assessed by blast analysis. then these primer sets were tested in real-time pcr runs with sybr® green as fluorescent marker and  <dig> μl of dna template extracted from  <dig> ml of titrated suspensions  of strains psv itm <dig>  psn itm <dig> and psf ncppb <dig>  since sybr® green binds to the minor grooves of a dna double-chain as it is forming, this fluorescent dye can bind to all amplicons produced in a pcr reaction. therefore, the specificity of detection can be provided by a pair of primers only when the increase in fluorescence is generated by a single amplicon with a distinct melting temperature . for this reason dissociation analysis is crucial in sybr® green pcr experiments. the melting curves obtained with the primer pairs developed in this study are shown in figure  <dig> 

for all the five different cell concentrations a single melting peak at  <dig> °c  was observed with the primer pair psvrt-f/psvrt-r and dna extracted from isolate psv itm <dig>  to indicate that the total fluorescent signal was contributed by specific amplicons. no signals were recorded in melting point analysis with the set psvrt-f/psvrt-r in dna-free control and when no target dnas were used as template . the pair psnrt-f/psnrt-r obtained a similar specificity, giving a unique melting peak at  <dig> °c  only with dna from strain psn itm <dig>  as well as the primer set psfrt-f/psfrt-r that originated a single peak at  <dig> °c  only with dna from strain psf ncppb <dig>  in these cases as well, dna-free controls and the dnas supposed not to be specific for these primers tested negative , unless spiked with target dna specific for the primer pair used . the pathovar-specificity of each primer pair was further confirmed using as template dnas from the bacteria listed in table  <dig>  the results obtained are schematically reported for each strain; the signs + and - indicate the presence or absence of the expected melting peak, respectively . moreover the amplicons produced by sybr® green real-time pcr were visualized by gel electrophoresis. single bands of the expected sizes of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp were specifically generated with the primer sets psvrt-f/psvrt-r, psnrt-f/psnrt-r, psfrt-f/psfrt-r and isolates belonging to psv, psn and psf, respectively, and no aspecific amplification products were ever observed .

in figure  <dig> the sensitivity of each pathovar-specific primer pair is also represented. for each primer set increasing amounts of the specific target dna corresponded to higher melting peaks having the same tm, and dna as small as that extracted from  <dig> cfu could be easily detected.

the standard curves for the absolute quantification of the dna target by sybr® green real-time pcr detection methods here developed were generated by evaluating the ct values versus the log of dna concentration of each tenfold dilution series . as shown in figure  <dig> the linearity of the quantification was demonstrated over a range of five logs , with excellent correlation coefficients  of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for pathovar-specific primer sets psvrt, psnrt and psfrt, respectively. the slopes of the standard curves  were equivalent to pcr efficiencies ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, to indicate that these sybr® green real-time pcr assays are solid even with low dna target concentrations, as further confirmed when the ct values obtained with dna from titrated suspensions were reported on the plots .

taqman® real-time pcr assays for psv, psn and psf specific detection
sybr® green real-time pcr is a reliable quantitative dye detection procedure, but unsuitable for multiple targets. in this perspective, on the sequences of the amplicons produced with the primer pairs psvrt-f/psvrt-r, psnrt-f/psnrt-r and psfrt-f/psfrt-r, the taqman® probes psvrt-p, psnrt-p and psfrt-p were designed to specifically identify psv, psn and psf strains, respectively . these fluorogenic probes were used in real-time pcr runs with  <dig> μl of dna template, extracted from  <dig> ml of various titrated suspensions  of strains psv itm <dig>  psn itm <dig> and psf ncppb <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  all these taqman® probes provided the desired level of specificity, and ct values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> were generated with target dna extracted from  <dig> to  <dig> cfu. no significant changes in ct were ever observed when target dna was spiked with dna from no-target p. savastanoi pathovars  or with dna from the host plant of the target p. savastanoi pathovar and from a pool of bacterial epiphytes present on this plant . fluorescence always remained below the threshold values in dna-free controls. the specificity was further confirmed using as template dna  extracted from the bacteria listed in table 1: an increase in fluorescence, at the expected wavelength, was always obtained for all the strains of a p. savastanoi pathovar when the reaction mixture contained the taqman® probe supposed to be specific for that pathovar, as schematically reported in table  <dig>  negative results were always recorded using no-target dnas.

the detection limits of taqman® real-time pcr reactions were evaluated using different dna amounts  and standard curves for quantitative analyses were constructed for the three target p. savastanoi pathovars, using ct values from three independent runs of pcr assays with three replicates each, plotted versus the log of dna concentration of each tenfold dilution series. standard curves showed a linear correlation between input dna and ct values over a range of six logs , for all the pathovar-specific p. savastanoi taqman® probes . detection limits were always  <dig> fg of target dna for psv, psn, and psf, using the specific taqman® probe, corresponding to about  <dig> bacterial genomes. concerning r <dig> values, these were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , with corresponding amplification efficiencies of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, for the probes psvrt-p, psnrt-p and psfrt-p, respectively .

multiplex real-time pcr assays for psv, psn and psf specific detection on artificially inoculated olive plants
in order to test whether the taqman® probes here developed were compatible in multiplex reactions and whether they are applicable in vivo, some preliminary experiments were performed using as template dna extracted by thermal lysis from olive leaves artificially inoculated with a bacterial suspension of strain psv itm <dig>  alone or in combination with strains psn itm <dig> and psf ncppb <dig>  as described subsequently in methods. the results obtained are reported in figure  <dig>  where all the three probes maintained the expected level of specificity in multiplex reactions as well, enabling the simultaneous detection of all the three target p. savastanoi pathovars, if present. the probe psvrt-p gave always positive fluorescence signals at the expected wavelength, with almost the same ct values in all the samples tested . the wavelength-specific fluorescence increase for the other two taqman® probes, psn-rt-p and psf-rt-p, was observed only when the dna template was extracted from olive leaves also inoculated with the p. savastanoi pathovars for which these probes were previously demonstrated to be specific . no differences were observed among the cts obtained with the probe psvrt-p and using as template the dna extracted from the washings of leaves inoculated with strain psv itm <dig> alone or in combination with strains psn itm <dig> and psf ncppb <dig> . for each probe, fluorescence always remained below the threshold values for the water controls, and for the dna extracted from leaves inoculated with sterile water or uninoculated. moreover the sensitivity of each taqman® probe was unaffected by multiplexing, as assessed comparing the ct values of the relative standard curves with those here obtained , both using pure dna from pss itm <dig>  psn itm <dig> and psf ncppb <dig> , and dna from the same pathovars extracted from olive leaves washings .

discussion
pcr-based methods are being increasingly used for detecting phytopathogenic bacteria, as recently reviewed by palacio-bielsa et al.  <cit> . traditional methods are mainly based on the isolation of bacterial plant pathogens on semi-selective media, followed by morphological identification. such methods are time consuming, usually require deep taxonomic expertise and are not able to give accurate results for pathogen quantification. on the contrary pcr-based protocols allow rapid, precise and direct bacterial detection, even in planta. moreover, some of these techniques give quantitative results and are able to simultaneously detect up to five different target pathogens. as far as p. savastanoi is concerned, sanitary certification programs for olive and oleander mother plants and propagation materials already started in many countries  <cit> , but the presence of psv and psn on these plants is still assessed mainly by visual inspection, looking for the typical hyperplastic knots. on the other hand, it was clearly demonstrated that the spread of the disease can also occur with asymptomatic propagation materials, where these bacteria can be found either as endophytes or as epiphytes  <cit> . hence innovative detection protocols for p. savastanoi pathovars, which have very low detection limits and are able to obtain good results in vivo, are strongly needed and can be achieved only by pcr-based methods. all the pcr-based protocols up to now available for p. savastanoi are unable to differentiate psv, psn and psf strains  <cit>  and this could be an enormous limit for their routine applicability. in fact, while nothing is known yet about the natural distribution of psv, psn and psf on the different hosts, cross-infections have been reported to occur under experimental conditions  <cit> . thus, the availability of highly reliable pathovar-specific identification tests is both fundamental to definitely assess the natural host range of the p. savastanoi pathovars here examined and mandatory in light of the application of sanitary certification programs for olive and oleander.

in our study, a global approach was undertaken and for the first time a complex of pcr assays was developed for the highly specific and sensitive identification, detection and discrimination of the three pathovars psv, psn and psf, in multiplex and quantitative reactions as well. these protocols were thought to be suitable both for research and for diagnostic purposes, with different laboratories applying end point pcr or real-time pcr, using sybr® green or pathovar-specific taqman® probes, according to the aims of the work and to the available instrumentations and skills.

all these assays had a specificity score of 100%, since the only positive strains are those belonging to the p. savastanoi pathovar for which the pcr-based protocol was designed. to this purpose forty-four p. savastanoi strains were tested, having different geographical origins and belonging to the pathovars psv, psn and psf. negative results were always obtained with closely taxonomically related bacteria, such as psp and psg, and with bacterial epiphytes naturally occurring on leaves of olive, oleander and ash, as well as with dna extracted from these plants and from oak, unless spiked with the p. savastanoi target dna.

concerning detection limits, positive results were obtained in end point and real-time pcr with dna amounts as small as  <dig> or  <dig>  pg per reaction. amounts of dna corresponding to about  <dig> -  <dig> genomes per reaction could be easily detected in real-time pcr runs, with ct values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and from  <dig> to  <dig>  with sybr® green or taqman® probes, respectively, and according to the pathovar examined. the pcr protocols already available for the detection of psv appeared to be slightly more sensitive than the assays developed in this study , but it is to point that no reliable comparison was possible among data obtained in conventional pcr and real-time pcr  <cit> . concerning the quantitative assay previously developed for psn, based on the real time monitoring of the reaction and on the use of a taqman® probe  <cit> , it had higher performances  than those obtained with the same technical approach in the present study, but after a one-day enrichment step. since the primers and the probes here designed are extremely pathovar-specific, the taqman® real-time procedures developed were also demonstrated to be an excellent quantitative method even when applied to multiplex assays for psv, psn and psf specific detection and discrimination on artificially inoculated olive plants.

as a precaution against the possibility of false negative results, due to the presence of pcr inhibitors in the samples or to malfunctions of the thermal cycler, it is necessary not only to choose a dna extraction procedure which would be able to eliminate pcr inhibitors, but also to ascertain their absence through a systematic monitoring. to this aim an internal amplification control  is sometimes included in the assay to test both pcr performance and inhibition  <cit> . but in some cases iac was demonstrated to alter the precision and accuracy of the pcr assay itself, particularly in real-time pcr experiments  <cit> . for this reason in this study the possibility of false-negative results on positive samples was completely excluded using a different and more efficient strategy. prior to be used in the detection assays, dnas extracted from bacteria were tested by amplifying 16s rdna with universal primers  <cit>  and all the plant samples were tested as spiked with  <dig> ng/reaction of target p. savastanoi bacterial dna: only those giving positive results were then further processed, while those testing negative were rejected and their dna extraction repeated.

CONCLUSIONS
the main novelty of this paper consists in the development of a versatile complex of pcr tools that for the first time will enable to easily and unequivocally distinguish psv, psn and psf strains. the present end point pcr assays are robust and suitable for routine culture confirmation purposes of these strains, avoiding laborious pathogenicity trials. concerning the real-time pcr procedures, their high analytical sensitivity is definitely high enough for direct testing of plant materials, to detect the presence of these bacteria as epiphytes. unlike the other assays published so far on in vivo pcr detection of psv and psn, the procedures here developed do not absolutely need any enrichment and nested-pcr, so that to avoid any possible contamination. further experiments will focus on the upgrade of these protocols for the in planta detection of these bacteria as endophytes, encouraged by the results here obtained with the pathovar-specific taqman® probes. moreover because of their multiplexing activity, these probes are already available to yield new important insights into the epidemiology of psv, psn and psf and of the diseases they caused.
