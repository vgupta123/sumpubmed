BACKGROUND
monoclonal antibodies  targeted at tumour associated antigens  are a promising new therapeutic option for treating cancer patients. moabs such as rituximab  <cit>  and trastuzumab  <cit>  are already becoming part of the standard treatment regimen, targeting taa+ tumours specifically and with fewer side effects than chemotherapeutics. however, a number of problems that diminish antibody efficacy in a therapeutic setting still need to be addressed. the large size of a full sized antibody slows vascular diffusion and prevents its penetration deep into solid tumours <cit> . moreover, radionuclide or cytotoxin coupled molecules persist longer in the general circulation and can thus cause more toxic side-effects  <cit> . an equally important, yet sometimes overlooked issue is the production of sufficient quantities of moab. moab therapies involve high doses, usually more than  <dig> g per patient per year, and can only be generated in relatively expensive mammalian cell fermentors <cit> .

in order to address the poor tumour penetration of full-sized antibodies, moab derivatives, such as fab and scfv fragments, have been generated that, due to their smaller size, penetrate more readily in tissues and can deliver a rapid peak dose at the tumour site <cit> . however, molecules smaller than  <dig> kda are generally cleared too rapidly from the body to allow sufficient tumour accumulation. intermediate sized recombinant antibodies, such as the  <dig> kda minibodies, still demonstrate good tissue penetration, while not being cleared as rapidly from the blood <cit> . most of these molecules lack an fc effector domain but can be used as blocking agents for growth factor receptors, inducers of apoptosis or as carriers of radiotherapeutic isotopes, toxins, cytokines or other biologically active proteins <cit> . several ways of making intermediate sized antibody derivatives have already been described which mainly involve the usage of different dimerisation motifs such as leucine zippers or fc chain interactions <cit> . as with moabs, obtaining sufficient correctly folded or heterodimerised product for large-scale application often is a bottleneck for these recombinant antibody derivatives. major efforts are therefore being made in the development of cheap and efficient heterologous expression systems. over the last few years, yeasts, like pichia pastoris, have gained a significant interest for the production of recombinant antibody fragments using cheap mineral defined media and requiring shorter process times as compared to mammalian cell culture <cit> . the possibility to grow yeasts to high cell densities of up to  <dig> g/l dry biomass, along with the availability of strong, inducible promoters, such as the alcohol oxidase gene  promoter, are further advantages of heterologous expression in p. pastoris  <cit> .

we previously described a novel model to engineer bi- or trivalent antibody derivatives  of intermediate size , based on fusion of single-chain variable fragments  to the c-terminus of one or each of the fd and l chains of a fab fragment <cit> . fab-scfv bsab are efficiently produced in mammalian cells, with 90% of the product being in the correctly heterodimerised form. in this study, we describe the production and purification of the human ph <dig> fab-scfv bivalent bibody and fab- <dig> trivalent tribody directed against the muc <dig> taa. this tumour antigen is an under-glycosilated form of muc <dig>  and is associated with poor prognosis upon overexpression in breast and pancreas cancer <cit> . using the fab-sfv template, we formatted the αmuc <dig> bi- and tribodies for expression in p. pastoris, and compared the p. pastoris production system to transient expression in human hek293t cells and stable expression in mouse ns <dig> cells. the binding functionalities of both mammalian and yeast derived preparations are gauged demonstrating the functional equivalence of the respective preparations. combined, these results demonstrate p. pastoris to be a viable alternative expression system for fab-scfv molecules.

RESULTS
construction of ph <dig> bibody and tribody expression vectors
the bivalent bibody and trivalent tribody targeting the muc1-taa were designed using the fab-sfv model <cit> . a bivalent bibody was generated by fusing a ph <dig> scfv fragment to the c-terminus of the ph <dig> fab fd chain . for the trivalent tribody, an additional ph <dig> scfv was fused to ph <dig> l chain. the combination of ph1heavy-scfv and ph1light chains  leads to the formation of a  <dig> kda bibody. combining the ph1heavy-scfv and ph1light-scfv chains results in a  <dig> kda tribody.

the pes <dig> vector was constructed to facilitate cloning and expression of bi- and tribody genes in mammalian cells . to this end, the βactin-βglobulin promoter and cmv enhancer from pcaggs were introduced in the pcdna3- plasmid carrying the zeocin resistance gene. to facilitate expression and excretion, a kozak sequence and a consensus excretion signal sequence were introduced in front of the expression cassette. eco47iii, bspei and bamhi restriction sites were introduced to allow modular exchange of antibody expression cassettes. the ph1heavy-scfv and ph1light-scfv expression cassettes were subsequently cloned into pes <dig> for expression in hek293t and ns <dig> mammalian host cells.

for the expression of ph <dig> bi-and tribodies in p. pastoris, a single vector based on pkai <dig> was constructed, with a bicistronic expression cassette for both the light and heavy chain . pkai <dig> originated from pgapzalfaa in which several additional features were introduced, including an aox <dig> promotor from ppicza. the ph <dig> bibody and tribody light and heavy chains were first introduced into separate pkai <dig> derived vectors, after which the expression modules for the heavy and light chain were combined in one vector, resulting in the pkai61-bibody-ph <dig> and pkai61-tribody-ph <dig> vectors.

expression of ph <dig> bibody and tribody in mammalian cells
the bibody and tribody expression vectors were expressed in the mammalian cell lines hek293t and ns <dig>  the expression and heterodimeric nature of both molecules was verified through western blot detection of reduced and non-reduced samples with human κ and anti-his specific antibodies. transient expression of the bibody encoding plasmids in hek293t cells revealed the expected  <dig> and  <dig> kda molecular mass bands from the ph1heavy-scfv and ph1light chains under reducing conditions and the  <dig> kda bibody under non-reducing conditions . similarly, transient hek293t expression of the tribody plasmids resulted in a  <dig> kda band from the ph1heavy-scfv and ph1light-scfv chains under reducing conditions and the  <dig> kda tribody under non-reducing conditions . the same bibody and tribody products were obtained following stable expression of the ph1heavy-scfv/ph1light and ph1heavy-scfv/ph1light-scfv plasmid combinations in ns <dig> cells. figure 2c shows the western blot detection with his-tag specific antibodies of a non-reduced sample of the ph <dig> bibody clone ns0-bi <dig>  figure 2d shows a similar blot for the ph <dig> tribody clone ns0-tri <dig>  both clones were selected on the basis of elisa with mgroel-muc <dig> coated plates and anti-human κ detection . providing a more constant long-term product supply, the stable ns <dig> transfectants were further used as source for mammalian produced bi- and tribody.

purification of mammalian cell produced ph <dig> bibody and tribody
ph1-derived bibody and tribody were purified using immobilised metal affinity chromatography  for the main purification step. figure 3a illustrates the fractionation of ns <dig> produced ph <dig> tribody onto an equilibrated imac column. western blotting after elution revealed the presence of ph <dig> bibody and tribody in the  <dig> mm imidazole fractions . to obtain a higher grade product, we performed sec to remove any remaining dimers or aggregates. to this end,  <dig> ml of the eluted fraction of the bi- or tribody was loaded on a sephacryl s- <dig> column equilibrated with pbs . for the bibody, the product was present exclusively as monomers. in the tribody preparation, less than 4% of the original sample was observed as dimers. an estimated 90% of the product loaded on the column could be recovered with an estimated purity of 95%.

based on colorimetric concentration determination and on the analysis of the coomassie stained sds-page gels, the overall efficiency for stably produced ph <dig> bi- and tribody was estimated at 77% and yielded  <dig>  mg bibody and  <dig> mg tribody per litre ns <dig> supernatant, starting from  <dig> l cultures.

stable production of ph <dig> bibody and tribody in p. pastoris
the bicistronic pkai61-bibody-ph <dig> and pkai61-tribody-ph <dig> vectors were linearised and transformed to p. pastoris through electroporation. westernblot detection with s-protein ap and coomassie staining of sds-page gels loaded with unreduced pichia supernatant samples revealed the successful expression of both the ph <dig> bibody  and tribody . as in mammalian cells, no significant amounts of separate heavy chains were observed during bi-and tribody expression. expression of the ph1light-scfv light chain vector alone resulted in production of  <dig> kda free light chain monomers and did not result in extensive light chain homodimerisation . individual clones were screened by means of an s-tag assay . this resulted in the selection for further production of the bibody clone pichia-bi <dig> and tribody clone pichia-tri <dig> which expressed the highest levels of bibody and tribody.

a small scale  <dig> day production of the bi- and tribody was performed in ypnm with antifoam and 1% methanol added every  <dig> h. the resulting supernatant was purified using imac , preceded by ammonium sulphate precipitation to remove peptides and other interfering substances from the yeast medium. further purification over a gelfiltration column of the antibody containing eluate resulted in an estimated 95% pure preparation free of light chain homodimers , with a total estimated product recovery of 22%. in total  <dig>  mg pure bibody per litre of supernatant was recovered from a  <dig> ml shake-flask culture. for the tribody  <dig> mg pure product per litre supernatant was recovered from an initial culture volume of  <dig> ml.

binding characteristics of mammalian and yeast cell produced bi- and tribodies
the muc <dig> antigen binding capacity and apparent affinity of ph <dig> bi- and tribodies, produced in ns <dig> and pichia pastoris cells, were verified by elisa using recombinant muc <dig> peptide as antigen. the monovalent ph <dig> fab was used as a reference. as shown in figure 5a, the mammalian produced ph <dig> bibody demonstrated a 25-fold increase in apparent affinity when compared to the ph <dig> fab. this increment was comparable to the values observed for the yeast produced bibody , thus resulting in kd values of approximately  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm for the mammalian and yeast bibody respectively. the extra ph <dig> scfv attached to the ph <dig> tribody resulted in a further 3-fold increase in apparent affinity in relation to the bibody. again, this was the case for both mammalian  and yeast cell produced  tribody products. to further confirm the equivalent binding of the ns <dig> and pichia produced ph <dig> bi- and tribody, binding to the muc1+ tumour cell-line ovcar <dig> was examined by flow cytometry. both ph <dig> bibody and tribody demonstrated significant binding  and no apparent differences could be observed between the mammalian and yeast expressed products. also, no significant binding was detected when muc1- lovo cells were used . these results demonstrate that both production methods yielded products with comparable specific activities.

discussion
alternatively glycosilated muc <dig> is overexpressed on a large number of carcinomas and is associated with poor prognosis, making it an interesting target for antibody immunotherapy <cit> . the human ph <dig> fab targeted against the muc <dig> taa was used to develop a human bivalent bibody and trivalent tribody by respectively fusing one or two ph <dig> scfvs to the c-terminus of the fab chains. both molecules are of an intermediate weight, which should slow clearing from the body compared to fab and scfv fragments, and should also improve tumour penetration compared to moabs. as with previously described mammalian expressed bi- and tribodies <cit> , the hek293t and ns <dig> produced ph <dig> bi- and tribody were expressed almost exclusively as correctly heterodimerised fab-scfv products, a characteristic attributed to processing in the endoplasmatic reticulum of the l and fd chains by the mammalian immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein  chaperone  <cit> . however, also expression in p. pastoris resulted in the majority of bi- and tribody products being correctly heterodimerised. sds-page analysis of pichia supernatant revealed, as in mammalian cells <cit> , the absence of heavy chains released from the cells. this suggests that the yeast karp <dig>  a hsp70-class  heat shock protein and analogue of mammalian bip, plays the same chaperone role as bip in the endoplasmatic reticulum <cit> , retaining the heavy chains until correctly paired with a light chain. transfection of the light chain resulted in secretion of mainly l-chain monomers with only a minor fraction of dimers, indicating that the affinity between light chains is limited. by removing the his6-tag sequence from the light chain dna, l-chain homodimers were further excluded during imac purification.

in mammalian cells, the use of the strong βactin-βglobulin hybrid promoter and upstream cmv enhancer in pes <dig> results in increased expression compared to cmv and ef <dig> promotors  <cit> . transient expression of the ph <dig> bi- and tribody in the pes <dig> system produced  <dig>  mg bibody and  <dig>  mg tribody per litre hek293t medium . these values are akin to what we described before for mouse bispecific bibodies  <cit> . the three-fold difference in expression levels between the ph <dig> bibody and tribody was also observed in the stably transfected mammalian ns <dig> and yeast cells. besides the 35% larger size of the tribody, the more complex structure of the molecule and the presence of  <dig> copies of both the ph <dig> vh and vl could hamper the correct cellular expression.

stable production in ns <dig> cells clearly resulted in increased production compared to transient expression in hek293t. in addition, the use of protein free medium raised the overall purification efficacy from 56% for hek293t productions to 77% for ns <dig> productions. the peak cell concentration in ns <dig> batch culture was around  <dig>  cells/l. this leaves the possibility to further increase production by switching to a fed-batch system in which culture conditions are more finely tuned  <cit> . although culture media costs have been significantly reduced in the past years, producing antibodies and their derivatives in mammalian cells still is a relatively expensive procedure  <cit> . hence, there is a profound interest in alternative production systems based on more primitive cells with shorter process times and the ability to grow to very high cell densities on cheap media. the commonly used prokaryotic e. coli expression systems do not seem suited for the production of the large heterodimeric bi- and tribody molecules. bibody production in e. coli cells resulted in a limited expression levels of 50– <dig> μg product/l <cit> . pichia pastoris has however gained significant interest over the last few years for the production of recombinant antibodies and antibody fragments. this methylotropic yeast can secrete large amounts of recombinant antibody fragments like scfvs, bivalent scfvs and fabs <cit> . the non-human glycosilation patterns of p. pastoris are however a problem for the production of complete moabs, yet are not an issue for the non-glycosilated bi- and tribodies. building on this, we successfully produced in p. pastoris ph <dig> bi -and tribodies in viable quantities. gelfiltration of the pichia products demonstrated that very few dimers and nearly no degradation products were present after imac purification. yet, also in p. pastoris, tribody clones were  <dig> times less productive as compared to bibody clones. however, the surprisingly good production level in pichia of a trivalent antibody with  <dig> mg pure product/l supernatant may be an advantage when compared to other trispecific or trivalent intermediate sized antibody models, like trispecific single chains <cit>  and triabodies <cit>  that produce in the  <dig>  mg/l range in e. coli fermentations. although the yields obtained in pichia medium were comparable to ns <dig> yields, the low recovery rate from pichia medium of 22% leaves ample room for optimisation of the purification procedures. replacing the standard ammonium precipitation step, wasting about 50% of the product, with a column based capture step may be a straightforward way to achieve such an increase in recovery. combined with increases in yield through growing the pichia clones in closely monitored fermentation conditions, further increases in overall production yield are likely to be achieved.

CONCLUSIONS
independent of the expression system used, the bi- or tribody molecules bound to their muc <dig> targets with equal effectiveness either in a peptide context or on ovcar <dig> cancer cells, indicating the mammalian and yeast expression products were of similar specific activity.

combined with the efficient expression and recovery of the yeast produced bi- and tribodies, our results identify p. pastoris as a valuable alternative to mammalian expression for the production of recombinant antibody derivatives based on the fab heterodimerisation platform.
