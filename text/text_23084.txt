BACKGROUND
rainbow trout  are cultivated worldwide for aquaculture production. trout farming has been successful in north america, the species native area, as well as in many other regions, including chile and a number of european countries where rainbow trout had been introduced since the 19th century. in  <dig>  total world production was about  <dig>  metric tons with a total export value estimated around  <dig>  billions usd .

the rainbow trout is one of the most intensively studied fish species. several features such as in vitro fertilization, ease of rearing and gamete handling and a large body size with large and clearly defined tissues, make it a particularly suited model to carry out a range of investigations. hence, considerable amount of basic knowledge has been accumulated in many areas such as physiology, nutrition, behaviour, ecology, genetics, pathology, comparative immunology, carcinogenesis and toxicology .

combining biological and phenotypic data with genomic information can be used to increase our basic knowledge of the regulation of biological functions, and ultimately used in applied research to improve the environmental and genetic management of aquaculture production systems with focus on complex traits such as meat and carcass quality, stress tolerance or resistance to specific pathogens.

the rainbow trout genome size was estimated to be between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> base pairs   <cit> . a whole genome duplication event occurred  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago in the common ancestor of the salmonids. since that time, re-diploidization has resulted in a semi-tetraploid state  <cit> . consequently, presence of duplicated genetic markers was reported  <cit>  and many homeologous regions have been identified in the rainbow trout genome  <cit> . although the tetraploidization event increased the genome complexity, it also makes the salmonids a very pertinent group to study the differential evolution and loss of duplicated genes in the process of re-diploidization.

several genomic resources have been developed in rainbow trout in the last decade. seven linkage maps based on either aflp markers  <cit>  or microsatellite markers and few snps  <cit>  have been constructed. these maps are used for comparative mapping across salmonid species  <cit> , for qtl mapping studies for various traits  <cit>  or for linkage disequilibrium studies  <cit> . attempts for high throughput discovery of snp markers are emerging but only a limited number of true snp have been validated up to now  <cit> . large est databases  are available, as well as high content dna microarrays  <cit> . several bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries have also been established  <cit> .

bac libraries are a valuable genomic resource for many purposes, including clone-based sequencing, positional cloning and physical mapping. the first physical map in rainbow trout was recently built using the 10x hindiii bac library  <cit> . the map contained  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the physical length of the map contigs was estimated to be approximately  <dig>  gb, which represents almost 83% of rainbow trout genome.

bac-end sequencing has been initially proposed to be an efficient approach for whole genome sequencing projects  <cit> , for comparative physical mapping  <cit> , and for the development of molecular markers, mainly microsatellites  <cit> . in the absence of whole genome sequences, bes analysis can elucidate sequence content and complexity, including gene density, potential transposable elements, and microsatellite markers  <cit> . furthermore, paired bac-end sequences can be very useful for scaffolding in whole-genome sequencing assembly projects.

here we report on the sequencing and characterization of bac-end sequences  from more than half of the clones from the rainbow trout 10x hindiii bac library. the sequence content was analysed for putative genes, repetitive elements and simple sequence repeats . bes gene content was then used to establish regions of conserved synteny with other fish genomes.

RESULTS
bac-end sequencing statistics
sequencing of rainbow trout bac ends generated  <dig>  raw data reads of more than  <dig> bp from  <dig>  bac clones, of which  <dig>   had both ends sequenced and  <dig>  had only one end sequenced. an additional  <dig>  bes were filtered-out because of high similarity to bacterial and vector sequences or because of low quality sequence. the total of high quality rainbow trout sequence reads was  <dig>  including one hundred forty eight bes sequenced twice for quality control purposes.

the phred q <dig> read length ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp with a mean of  <dig> bp. the trout bes q <dig> average length was similar to catfish  <cit>  but lower than atlantic salmon  <cit> . overall, bac-end sequencing generated a total  <dig> , <dig> bp of genomic sequence representing approximately 4% of the trout genome . the gc content was estimated to be around 42%, which is lower than channel catfish  <cit>  and stickleback , but higher than zebrafish  and medaka  .

preliminary survey of repeat content from rainbow trout genome
few studies have reported the identification and characterization of repeat elements in salmonids, resulting in the absence of sufficient repeat masking data set for rainbow trout. repbase update release  <dig>  contains only  <dig> ancestral shared repeats and one lineage-specific repeat for rainbow trout, and for salmon,  <dig> ancestral shared repeats and five lineage-specific repeats  <cit> . consequently, masking of rainbow trout bes using repbase  <dig>  generated only  <dig> % of masked sequences. therefore, we used the bes data to generate a new rainbow trout repeat library. this database contains  <dig> putative elements and was named inra rt rep <dig>  . repeat element analysis using the new inra rt rep <dig>  library masked almost  <dig> % of the bes database in base-pairs . the most abundant repeat elements were dna transposons, and the most common transposon type was the tcmar-tc <dig> transposon-related sequence  . unknown elements were also abundant and accounted for  <dig> % of bes .

columns  <dig> and  <dig> show the name of the repeat elements. columns  <dig> and  <dig> provide the number of repeats elements in the inra rt rep <dig>  generated in this work. columns  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to the percentage of total base pairs masked by the corresponding repeat element.

for comparison we masked the rainbow trout bes dataset with the atlantic salmon repeat database  and found that only  <dig> % of the bes dataset was masked compared to  <dig> % with the rainbow trout repeat database. we also estimated the redundancy of each species specific database by repeatmasking the inra rep <dig>  by salmon raw  <dig>  database and vice versa. we observed that respectively  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the databases were masked suggesting differences in the repeats content between the two salmonid species. however, it is also possible that the restriction enzyme selection for the bac libraries preparation  might have imposed some bias on the repeats content of each database.

in addition to the automated detection of repeats using repeatmodeler, we checked for undetected repetitive elements by aligning the masked bes reads to each other. the alignment results were classified according to the number of significant hits and are summarized in figure  <dig>  most of the bes reads  had less than  <dig> hits, indicating that masking with the inra rt rep <dig>  library was effective. however,  <dig> reads  produced more than  <dig> hits, suggesting that these bes reads may contain repetitive dna sequences. moreover, almost  <dig> reads  produced more than  <dig> hits, suggesting that these bes reads contain interspersed repeats not yet in inra rt rep <dig>  database.

some classes of repeat elements in salmonids can be as long as  <dig>  bp  <cit> . progress is currently being made to further characterise these long interspersed repeats in rainbow trout by using full length bac-insert sequencing which will enable characterizing full-length copies of repeat elements and identifying new repeats .

development of microsatellite markers
a total of  <dig>  microsatellites were identified in  <dig>  bes reads . approximately 56% of the microsatellites  were suitable for pcr primers design as they were flanked by sequences of at least  <dig> bp. we were able to define  <dig>  primer-pairs  from  <dig>  distinct bes as more than one microsatellite can be detected in a single bes.

di-nucleotides were the most abundant repeat motif  followed by tetra-nucleotides  . the most abundant di-nucleotide repeats were tg/ca accounting for  <dig> %. ac/gt and ga/tc repeats accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. polymorphism and usefulness of the bes microsatellites for linkage analysis and genetic mapping was assessed in the usda-ncccwa panel of five families  <cit>  using  <dig> markers . out of the  <dig> loci tested,  <dig>  were polymorphic with allele numbers ranging from  <dig> to 12;  <dig>  failed to produce a specific pcr product and  <dig>  were monomorphics. fifteen microsatellite loci were duplicated, of which nine were useful for linkage mapping. these results show that most of the microsatellite markers developed from bes are polymorphic in the ncccwa reference families and thus can be used for direct integration between the genetic and physical maps of the rainbow trout genome  <cit> .

homology with other fish genomes
we investigated the bes sequence homology and gene content by computational and manual annotations. of the  <dig>  high quality bes reads,  <dig>  bes reads  had more than  <dig> base pairs of contiguous non repetitive sequences and were used for assessing genome syntenies by blastn and blastx similarity searches against the ensembl genome and peptide databases of zebrafish, medaka and stickleback. the fractions of the  <dig>  non-repetitive trout bes reads that had significant blastn hits against the zebrafish, medaka and stickleback genome databases were 15%,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, while the fractions of the non-repetitive bes reads that had significant blastx hits against the zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback protein databases were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . compared to similar analyses that used bes from non-model fish species to construct "in-silico" comparative genome maps  <cit> , the sequence homologies between rainbow trout and the model species were low, most likely due to the large evolutionary distance between the salmonids and the model species.

a the bioinformatic filtering criteria used for identifying 'unique' hits are described in the methods section.

multiple gene hits may be caused by gene duplications or by the presence of conserved sequences among members of gene families. blastx searches revealed hits with some genes existing in large copy numbers as exemplified by protocadherin members families  and odorant receptor members families  . the others gene hits showed identity to transposable elements such as piggybac transposable element  <dig> or line- <dig> type transposase domain containing  <dig> or transposase  which revealed that these transposable elements were not masked by the inra rt rep <dig>  database.

identification of regions of microsynteny
the sequence homology searches were conducted using both blastn and blastx alignment tools.

for blastn searches, we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bacs with both ends having significant unique hits to the medaka, stickleback, and zebrafish genomes, respectively . out of those,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unique paired bac-end hits matched on the same chromosome  in medaka, stickleback and zebrafish, respectively. of those, we identified  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  regions of microsynteny between rainbow trout and medaka, stickleback, and zebrafish, respectively .

for blastx analysis, we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bacs with both ends having significant gene hits to the medaka, stickleback, and zebrafish genomes, respectively . further analysis revealed that  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  paired bac-end gene hits were in macro-synteny. of those, we identified  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  regions of microsynteny between rainbow trout and medaka, stickleback, and zebrafish, respectively . finally, our blastn analyses identified  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unique paired bac end hits in macrosynteny that were also detected using blastx analyses .

as expected, our analysis revealed moderate macro-synteny between rainbow trout and the three model species and even lower level of microsynteny likely due to chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred since the divergent of those species from a common teleost ancestor. the strongest decline in number of microsynteny regions was observed for zebrafish, which is indeed more distant from rainbow trout than the medaka and stickleback  <cit> . while the number of significant bes hits with blastn was between  <dig>   to  <dig>   times greater than those with blastx hits, the difference in identifying microsynteny was even greater. the number of microsynteny regions identified with blastn was  <dig>   to  <dig>   times greater than blastx. this can be explained by several factors including incomplete annotations of the model fish genomes and the presence of pseudogenes and conserved non-coding sequences that were not included in the peptide databases. blastn also appears to be more accurate for estimating microsynteny as it provides the exact points of sequence matches on the chromosomes of the reference genomes . however, it is also important to note that 17%  to 33%  of the macro-synteny bac paired ends identified by blastx were not revealed by blastn. this may be caused by non- or less-conserved peptides whose coding sequences are not under strong selection pressure and have evolved enough to escape detection as significant unique hits by blastn.

the comparative genome analyses reported here provide a survey of conserved synteny between rainbow trout and three model fish species. the results of our analyses suggest that for many regions in the rainbow trout genome comparative mapping might serve as a useful genomic resource for identifying candidate genes in qtl detection studies. nevertheless, further assessment of regions of conserved synteny by direct sequencing of full-length bac clones and by evaluating gene content and orthology revealed that gene order, orientations, and gene length are highly variable across fish species .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we sequenced and subsequently characterized more than half of bac ends from the rainbow trout swanson yy double haploid male 10x hindiii bac library. these genomic sequences were used to generate the first rainbow trout specific repeat database containing  <dig> putative repeat elements. this database is useful for repeat masking in salmonid genomes. approximately  <dig> % of the bes database in base pairs was masked by this repeat database, providing for the first time an estimate of how much of the rainbow trout genome is composed of repetitive sequences. we detected  <dig>  microsatellites in the bes dataset, of which  <dig>  presented high quality flanking sequences with more than  <dig> bp in length. a subset of those were validated and used to construct the first rainbow trout integrated genetic-physical map  <cit> . the development of those new microsatellite markers will also serve to increase marker densities on current rainbow trout genetic maps and initiate in silico comparative mapping with species whose genomes have been fully sequenced. paired bac-ends were used to establish regions of microsynteny between trout and model fish species . the microsynteny analyses revealed low to intermediate genome homology between rainbow trout and the other fish species. our findings suggest that due to chromosomal breakage and rearrangements that have occurred during fish genomes evolution, only closely related species like other salmonids will be useful for chromosome-wide and genome-wide comparative analyses with rainbow trout.
