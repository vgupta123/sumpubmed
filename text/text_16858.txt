BACKGROUND
foot-and-mouth disease  is an acute, highly communicable and economically important disease caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus . animals that can be affected include cattle, swine, sheep, goats, wild pigs, wild ruminants and buffaloes  <cit> . fmdv is a positive sense single-stranded rna virus  occurring in seven serotypes, o, a, asia  <dig>  c, sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  each with a wide spectrum of antigenic and epidemiological different subtypes. the wide diversity is considered a consequence of the high mutation rate and quasi-species dynamic  <cit> .

fmd has been one of the most important diseases causing significant economic losses in the turkish livestock sector. together with production losses, export restrictions on several agricultural products cause additional losses to the turkish economy  <cit> .

turkey is of special interest for the european countries, because it is the natural connection to asia, where fmd is enzootic and thus serves as buffer zone against fmd  <cit> .

the two prevalent serotypes in turkey are a and o  <cit> , and especially the pandemic fmdv serotype o is a major threat to europe, because it is the most aggressive serotype  <cit> . however, this type o is still covered by the o1/manisa/ <dig> vaccine  <cit> .

serotype a displays a great antigenic diversity of subtypes and there is also often no cross-protection between them  <cit> . since  <dig> two subtypes of serotype a have been circulating in turkey, designated by the world reference laboratory iah pirbright as irn <dig> and irn <dig>  <cit> .

turkey practices vaccination against fmd, using a self produced trivalent vaccine consisting of o1/manisa/ <dig>  asia <dig> and since september  <dig> a member of the irn <dig> lineage as a replacement for a <dig>  previously included .

due to the introduction of a twice-yearly national vaccination campaign in  <dig>  the number of fmd outbreaks has decreased significantly, but not homogeneously over the whole country, which may be explained by vaccine failure or incomplete vaccine coverage  <cit> .

a common and major epitope of fmdv is located within the surface protein vp <dig>  containing the immuno-dominant gh-loop and the rgd-integrin binding motif, essential for cell attachment  <cit> . changes in this protein may cause vaccine failure and changes in host specificity  <cit> .

we describe the genetic diversity of the 1d nucleotide sequence which encodes for the vp <dig> protein, in isolates obtained from outbreaks in turkish cattle herds between  <dig> and  <dig> and analyse the data with regard to potential epidemiological information and to establish possibly whether fmd outbreaks are caused by viruses persistently circulating and evolving in turkey or by strains introduced to turkey.

RESULTS
phylogenetic inference
the 1d nucleotide sequence similarity scan  of the turkish isolates of the present study reveals two well separated groups for serotype a. the two groups are most similar at position  <dig> nt with 8% divergence given a windows size of  <dig> nt and most divergent at position  <dig> with 31% divergence. the latter region encodes the immuno-dominant gh-loop. the diversity within each of the two serotype a groups is low within a range of 2–4%.

serotype o, with o1/manisa/ <dig> as reference sequence, displays one homogeneous group, with a diversity in the range 9%.

the bayesian tree, based on the 1d nucleotide sequence of serotype a isolates shown in figure  <dig> reveals three clusters in turkey, related to a <dig>  irn <dig> and irn <dig>  the most recent isolate of the a <dig> cluster, for which sequence information is available was collected in iraq in  <dig>  the a <dig> cluster is distinctly separated from the irn <dig> and irn <dig> lineages as supported by a clade credibility value of  <dig>  and the irn <dig> and irn <dig> clusters are separated as supported by a clade credibility value of  <dig> .

the irn <dig> cluster is further subdivided into two temporal divergent groups, i and ii. the isolates of group i all originate from outbreaks in  <dig>  it was two years before this lineage was included in the turkish fmd vaccine.

the irn <dig> related viruses display a single, not further subdivided, phylogenetic structure; with the oldest isolate dq <dig> igdir/ <dig> , obtained from an outbreak in june  <dig> in the province igdir, close to the iranian border. another member of irn <dig> lineage is the isolate a/irn/22/99#  obtained from an outbreak in iran in  <dig> 

the inferred phylogeny of serotype o isolates , with the vaccine lineage as outgroup, displayed two major clusters a and b, supported by a clade credibility value of  <dig>  .

cluster a is split into the two groups i and ii. group i consists of sequences derived from fmd outbreaks in pakistan and iran in addition to a single outbreak in january/february  <dig> in the mersin region of turkey. the differential success, expressed as correlation to the number of substitutions, with regard to the vaccine lineage, is lowest in the group members obtained from outbreaks in pakistan in  <dig> and  <dig>  intermediate in the iranian isolates from  <dig> and  <dig> and most advanced in the turkish isolates from  <dig> 

group ii of cluster a consists of turkish isolates obtained from outbreaks in the provinces sivas in  <dig> and igdir in  <dig>  the latter province is close to the iranian border.

the majority of turkish isolates belong to cluster b, which can also be subdivided into two groups i and ii.

cluster i of group b was further subdivided into two lineages. one group consists of isolates, obtained only from outbreaks in turkey and the other of isolates known as the panasia lineage. this partition is supported by a clade credibility value of  <dig> . the turkish lineage displays an increasing differential success rate, with regard to the vaccine strain o1/manisa/ <dig>  starting from the dq <dig> ankara/ <dig>  isolate, obtained in the ankara province in  <dig>  towards the dq <dig> kutahya/ <dig>  isolate, obtained in the kutahya province in  <dig> 

cluster ii of group b consists of viruses obtained from outbreaks in turkey, israel and lebanon, with the earliest obtained from an outbreak in the turkish ankara region in  <dig> 

positive selection analysis
the examination of the deduced vp <dig> amino acid sequences of the serotype o isolates for selective pressures, show no significant  evidence for positive selection . on the contrary, residue  <dig> of serotype a isolates displays significant evidence  for positive selection . residue  <dig> is located in the immuno-dominant gh-loop of the vp <dig> molecule and therefore particularly exposed to the immune system of the host.

by investigating the inferred ancestor history of site  <dig> , it can be seen that all but two of the irn <dig> isolates, dq <dig> and dq <dig>  each collected from the same outbreak, have the common ancestor codon 'agc' , whereas irn <dig> has most likely the 'ggg'  codon as precursor.

comparing the translated amino acid sequences of the whole gh-loop region, located within the residues 140– <dig> , reveals that irn <dig> isolates consistently deviates from irn <dig> isolates by a deletion at site  <dig> as well as in lineage specific conserved amino acids at the sites:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the integrin-binding site arg-gly-asp   <cit> , was in all serotype a isolates, but dq <dig>  as 'rgdlgal'-motif present.

structural analysis
to compare the vp <dig> protein secondary structure we analysed the putative hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions along the length of the vp <dig> amino acid sequence, using the kyte and doolittle algorithm  <cit> . this revealed three different regions for the consensus sequences of the irn <dig> and irn <dig> lineages , as well as two major disparate regions for representatives of the serotype o lineages . the structural alignment of the tertiary structure, based on the consensus sequences of irn <dig> and irn <dig> , shown 75% sequence identity, revealed appreciable structural differences between the lineages, within the regions indicated by the hydrophobicity plot. there is evidence that the irn <dig> lineage has two β-sheet structures at the amino acid positions 40– <dig> and 105– <dig>  where irn <dig> has none, as well as a different helix-structure at position 140– <dig> .

from the hydrophobicity plot, dq <dig> sivas/ <dig>  seems to represent the most distinct lineage of the turkish serotype o isolates . however, the structural alignment between dq <dig> sivas/ <dig>  and the vaccine strain o1/manisa/ <dig>  displays a high similarity of 99% .

discussion
the similarity plot , as well as the phylogenetic analysis of serotype a , confirms the presence of two independent lineages within our collection of isolates. a member of the irn <dig> cluster was not included in vaccines before september  <dig>  which means that the vaccines before that did not provide sufficient protection against irn <dig> strains. however, the irn <dig> isolates  collected from outbreaks in  <dig>  and the clustering of these isolates with the irn <dig> isolates from iran and iraq alternatively suggests multiple introductions from one or both of these countries.

the irn <dig> lineage is suggested to be a newly introduced lineage rather than an escape mutant lineage evolved from irn <dig>  this is supported by the lack of evolutionary intermediates between the two clusters, the consistent differences between isolates of the two clusters and the low probability of a common ancestor of residue  <dig> potentially subject to positive selection. in addition that the first irn <dig> isolate reported in turkey originate from an outbreak in the province of igdir, close to the iranian border. the structural alignment of irn <dig> and irn <dig>  revealed significant conformational differences within this important immuno-dominant protein suggesting an immunological advantage of irn  <dig> strains given that a member of the irn <dig> is used as a vaccine component. however, antigenic comparisons based on virus neutralisation analysis and epidemiological data previously reported  <cit>  do not substantiate such a conclusion.

recalling the fact that structures are more conserved in evolution than sequences, these observed differences support the idea of an independently evolved irn <dig> lineage. recombination events between the two serotype a types irn <dig> and irn <dig> within the 1d region were not detected by the similarity scan. this may indicate that both serotypes a types are in the phase of high fitness and have found their particular ecological niche.

in contrast to the serotype a strains, the serotype o isolates included in this study constitute a more homogeneous group, as shown by the similarity plot .

the phylogenetic analysis of serotype o isolates demonstrate the presence of two major subtypes, cluster a and b , each further subdivided in distinct lineages. cluster a i contained isolates from one single outbreak in the turkish mersin province, as well as isolates obtained from earlier outbreaks in pakistan and iran. the temporal distribution and the differential success of these isolates, i.e. the branch lengths, suggest that the virus was introduced from pakistan to iran and then to turkey. cluster a ii, consisting of the turkish isolates dq <dig> sivas/ <dig>  and dq <dig> igdir/ <dig> , is well separated from a i and represent a sublineage only observed in turkey. the same conclusion may be valid for the cluster b i, which also exclusively comprised turkish isolates. however, the intermediate clade credibility value of  <dig>  at the node between cluster b i and the panasia lineage may indicate a closer relationship to the pandemic panasia lineage than displayed in the phylogenetic tree. an explanation for these purely turkish sublineages may be that the virus is circulating in turkish cattle herds, either through subclinically infected cattle or by transmission to cattle from other reservoirs such as sheep and goats.

cluster b ii is clearly separated from the panasia lineage, consisting of isolates from newer outbreaks in turkey, israel and lebanon, indicating the spread of this sublineage.

nevertheless, the structural comparison between the field isolates and the vaccine strain o1/manisa/ <dig>  displayed no distinct differences suggesting that the vaccine strain, o1/manissa/ <dig>  in current use should provide full protection. this suggestion is concordant with other studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study confirmed the presence of two major serotype a lineages, namely irn  <dig> and irn <dig>  in turkey. there was no evidence that the a <dig> strain was present in turkey during the examined period of time, however this may be related to the small sample size used in this study. the sequence and structural analysis of the irn <dig> related viruses revealed potential conformational differences of the irn <dig> vp <dig> possibly affecting the antigenic properties of particular regions. there is evidence that irn <dig> is introduced from outside to turkey, in all probability from iran.

since, the irn <dig> lineage is a component of the fmdv vaccine used since  <dig>  the outbreaks in  <dig> occurred most probably due to incomplete vaccine coverage.

the endemic, slowly evolving turkish o lineages, with a predicted vp <dig> structure similar to the o <dig> manisa vaccine, occurs in several sublineages in turkey. some of these sublineages are most probably introduced from neighbouring countries, whereas others are circulating within turkish cattle or are frequently reintroduced to cattle from persistently infected small ruminants, i.e. sheep and goats, which share pastures and transport vehicles.
