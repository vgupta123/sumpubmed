BACKGROUND
displacement of intervertebral disk  material is common in canine intervertebral disk diseases such as degenerative lumbosacral stenosis and ivd herniation  <cit> . ivd herniation in dogs was divided into type  <dig> and type  <dig> herniation by hansen approximately 60 years ago  <cit> . hansen type  <dig> herniation, also known as disk extrusion, is a displacement of nuclear material through all layers of the annulus fibrosus into the vertebral canal. hansen type  <dig> herniation, known as disk protrusion, describes a dorsal displacement of nuclear and annular material into the vertebral canal due to degenerative changes in the annular material. it is not always possible to distinguish between annular and nuclear material in diagnostic imaging. the discrimination of the quality of displaced ivd material when performing computed tomographic  imaging has not been described  <cit> . magnetic resonance imaging  allows the observer to distinguish between annular and nuclear disk material in t2-weighted  sequences, but only in healthy disks  <cit> .

annular and nuclear material cannot be distinguished in t2w mri sequences of degenerated ivds  <cit>  due to biochemical changes in the extracellular matrix of the nucleus  <cit> . a lower water content and a shift of proteoglycan composition of the nucleus pulposus results in a lower signal intensity in t2w mri sequences, making annular and nuclear material iso-intense to each other  <cit> . while ivd degeneration can lead to ivd herniation, herniated intervertebral disks are usually degenerated  <cit> .

additional sequences can help to identify the tissue origin of displaced ivd material. for example, seiler et al. used a t1-weighted  sequence to detect annular tears, which enable ivd herniation  <cit> . since the origin of intervertebral disk material cannot be seen in each patient and imaging modality, the previously described classification of hansen does not seem to be the optimal nomenclature in diagnostic imaging. in clinical work, however, hansen’s nomenclature is somewhat useful for summing up all clinical and imaging results for a patient  <cit> .

since the dog is a frequently used animal model in studies for human intervertebral disk disease due to comparable degenerative changes and clinical signs of ivd disease  <cit> , human medicine may offer a suitable nomenclature to describe displacement of ivd material in diagnostic imaging. the debate in human medicine about nomenclature of displaced ivd material has been under discussion for years. to standardize the multiplicity of terms, the north american spine society, american society of spine radiology and american society of neuroradiology created recommendations for nomenclature and classification of human disk pathology. these recommendations included the “disk extension beyond the interspace” -nomenclature  <cit> , which is often used in diagnostic imaging in human medicine  <cit> . this morphologic nomenclature states that the physiological position of ivds is in the interspace between the bony vertebral endplates. displacement of intervertebral disk material beyond these natural bony limits of the interspace is described by the terms bulging, protrusion and extrusion by the disks contour  <cit> . while disk bulging is a generalized, circumferential symmetrical displacement of ivd material, disk protrusion and extrusion are localized displacements of ivd material  <cit> . protrusions are defined as broad-based displacements of ivd material, while the diameter of the displaced ivd material of an extrusion is larger than the connection to the parental ivd  <cit> .

the origin and quality of ivd material, which are not always clearly visible in veterinary diagnostic imaging, have no influence on the debit-nomenclature. furthermore, the debit nomenclature is based on the ivd shape, as seen in transverse images that are generated in ct and mr imaging. consequently the same nomenclature might be suitable for both methods. a standardized nomenclature can facilitate communication among neurologists, surgeons and radiologists in clinical work. furthermore, a reliable description of dislocated ivd material is important for presurgical planning and definition of the surgical approach.

parts of debit-nomenclature have been used in studies of canine ivd herniation, but no statistical tests to assess reliability were performed  <cit> . seiler et al. staged ivd degeneration in low field mri, defining the term “herniation” as a localized displacement of disk material beyond the limits of the ivd space  <cit> . besalti et al. used the term “disk bulging” as a circumferential symmetrical uniform extension of the outer disk margin  <cit> . therefore, the aim of this study was to perform debit-classification of displaced canine ivd material in diagnostic imaging, testing reliability and variability. since mri and ct are widely used to image displaced ivd material, reliability of the debit-nomenclature was tested in both methods.

methods

mr images were obtained using a  <dig>  tesla high-field mri-scannera. a spine coilb was used for all examinations. five dogs with long or multiple areas of interest  were examined using the spine coil, and additionally with a neurovascular coilc. images-data of a t2w transverse turbo spinecho sequence  and a t1w multi-fast-field-echo sequence  with  <dig> measurements per echo were included in this study.

ct images were obtained with a  <dig> multislice-detector row ct-scannerd. cervical and thoracic vertebrae were examined with  <dig>  mm slice thickness, 120 kv voltage and a current of  <dig> mas per slice. the lumbar spine was examined using a 2 mm slice thickness, 140 kv voltage and a current of  <dig> mas per slice.

evaluation of imaging data
electronic records of the entire spine were evaluated retrospectively. image data-sets were included if any ivd was imaged in mri  as well as in ct. the ivd did not have to be displaced. in total,  <dig> ivds were available for evaluation . electronic records of the transverse mri sequences and the ct examination were blinded, duplicated and randomized using the pseudo-random function in statistical analyses software e. three observers with different degrees of working experience with ct and mri , observer 2: 5 years of experience  and observer 3: 24 years of experience ) evaluated the data sets on a standard computer-screen using the software imagejf . the displacement of ivd material was evaluated in transverse data sets of mffe, t2w_tse and ct using previously published definitions as follows  <cit> : normal, no debit; bulge, circumferential, symmetrical debit; protrusion, focal or asymmetrical debit into the vertebral canal, with the base of the disk being broader than any other diameter of the displaced disk material; extrusion, focal debit, the base against the parent disk being narrower than the diameter of displaced disk material . disk sequestration was defined as displaced ivd material with no connection to the disk of origin  <cit> . all observers were unaware of the clinical findings and diagnosis of the radiologist on-duty.figure  <dig> debit in the three imaging methods debit in magnetic resonance and computed tomographic imaging; for each debit category images of the same intervertebral disk are shown in: , t2-weighted transverse turbo spin echos sequence; , t1-weighted multi-fast-field-echo sequence; , transverse computed tomography.



statistical analysis
weighted kappa analysis was carried out in sas to evaluate intra- and interobserver agreement in all three diagnostic methods  and among those methods. agreement was interpreted according to landis and koch as being slight , fair , moderate , substantial  and excellent   <cit> . bowker’s test was performed to test differences in evaluation among the observers and methods. p-values <  <dig>  were considered to be significant.

RESULTS
 <dig> dogs with a mean age of  <dig>  years  and a mean weight of  <dig>  kilogrammes  were included in this study. a total of  <dig> intervertebral disks of these patients were available for evaluation including  <dig> disks of  <dig> chondrodystrophic dogs,  <dig> disks of  <dig> nonchondrodystrophic dogs and  <dig> disks of  <dig> mixed-breed dogs . the evaluation of magnetic resonance and computed tomographic images by the radiologist on-duty led to the following diagnoses:  <dig> patients had ivd herniation;  <dig> had a degenerative lumbosacral stenosis;  <dig> had myelomalacia without signs of spinal cord compression;  <dig> had a vertebral fracture due to trauma and  <dig> showed a massive malformation of the vertebrae resulting in compression of the spinal cord.

intraobserver agreement
intraobserver agreement of debit-classification in t2w_tse, mffe and ct  was moderate to substantial, with a 95% confidence range of  <dig>  to  <dig> . one sided p-value to kappa showed a highly significant correlation between two evaluations of the same observer . p-value by bowker’s test showed no significant differences in evaluation  in one observer classifying debit in an mri sequence or ct.table  <dig>

the results of the evaluation are summarized in figure  <dig>  which shows the evaluation of debit of the three observers in all methods. for each observer and method the mean value of two classification sessions was calculated. more normal ivds were identified in the evaluations by observers  <dig> and  <dig> in all methods than in the evaluations by observer  <dig>  observer  <dig> evaluated more ivds as being bulged in all methods than observers  <dig> and  <dig>  evaluation of disk protrusion by observer  <dig> showed fewer protruded ivds than observer  <dig> in all methods. these two observers found approximately the same number of protruded disks in t2w_tse and ct evaluation, while they scored more ivds as being protruded in mffe. observer  <dig> had different tendencies in the three methods, evaluating more ivds as being protruded in t2w_tse than in ct, followed by mffe. fewer ivds were judged as extruded by observer  <dig> compared with observers  <dig> and  <dig>  while observer  <dig> judged more ivds as being sequestrated than observers  <dig> and  <dig> 

interpretation of the term sequestration
in the proposed nomenclature, the term sequestration describes displaced disk material that has no contact to the ivd. interpretation and usage of the term “no connection to the disk of origin” was different among the observers. the results revealed that observers  <dig> and  <dig> used the term sequestration for displaced ivd material lying in the vertebral canal, but not directly dorsal to the intervertebral disk space. they used the term extrusion for displaced ivd material that was positioned dorsal to the intervertebral space, even if the connection could not be seen clearly. observer  <dig> used the term sequestration for displaced ivd material that was dorsal to the intervertebral disk space and showed no obvious contact zone.

discussion
the aim of this study was to test the reliability of debit-nomenclature in the evaluation of canine ivd displacement using different imaging methods. a good consistency in usage of a nomenclature is important, especially in preoperative planning when information about the current state of the ivd has to be communicated from one person to another. the consistent description of displaced ivd material, even by different investigators, is crucial for the best possible surgical approach or intervention. while good intraobserver reliability was found for each of the evaluated modalities , interobserver agreement showed mainly moderate results, with statistically significant differences in evaluation of debit between observers  <dig> and  <dig> . it can be concluded that intraobserver reliability is said to be better than interobserver reliability, as has been found in another study  <cit> . the wide variability in evaluation showed that debit-nomenclature cannot yet be recommended for evaluation of canine ivd displacement. four main factors were found in literature that influence the variability of the examination: the imaging method, the observers’ experience, the observers’ institution and the classification system used  <cit> . the potential influence of these four factors on the variability of debit-nomenclature in the present study is considered below.

regarding the imaging method, similar results were seen in the evaluation of debit in ct and mri . mri is the gold standard method for diagnosing displaced disk material causing spinal cord compression  <cit> . the intervertebral disk, the spinal cord and the cerebrospinal fluid are directly visible in a t2w mri sequence  <cit> . an additional t1w sequence is a useful tool for imaging annular tears and separate subdural haemorrhages from displaced ivd material  <cit> . the present study showed that both sequences used separately allow a comparable classification of displaced ivd material without statistically significant differences in evaluation.

the comparison of evaluation of mri with ct showed a slightly lower reliability but no statistically significant differences in evaluation . noncontrast ct shows the spinal cord surrounded by the epidural fat, which has an intermediate attenuation  <cit> . the intervertebral disks are isodense to the long back muscles or hyperdense due to calcification. displaced ivd material can be identified as a hyperattenuating mass in the vertebral canal if it is calcified  <cit> . in the present study  <dig> ivds showed calcified areas, mainly in the nucleus pulposus, but displaced ivd material was calcified in  <dig> cases only. if the displaced disk material is not calcified, it cannot be clearly seen and instead a loss of epidural fat or displacement of the spinal cord may help to identify the location of displaced ivd material  <cit> .

the present study highlights that canine displaced ivd material can be seen in ct images without need for ct-myelography due to statistically significant similar results of debit-evaluation in noncontrast ct compared to mri. nevertheless the comparison of the reliability of debit-nomenclature in ct and mri is limited by the other variables like the observers’ experience and institution.

in the present study, observers had different degrees of experience in diagnostic imaging. the evaluation of displaced ivd using image data obtained from different modalities showed that experienced observers  had similar results in intraobserver agreement in all methods . the less experienced observer  had a smaller intraobserver agreement in the evaluation of displaced ivd material in mffe than in the other sequence and ct. this finding can be explained by the circumstance that the observer had only little experience with that particular sequence.

the experienced observers  were familiar with the evaluation of structural changes in the spinal cord in mffe sequence. however, the evaluation of the ivd contour in mffe sequence was a new task for all three observers. due to a lack of experience with the mffe sequence in general, the evaluation of debit in that sequence might have been more challenging for observer  <dig> when compared to the evaluation of the t2w_tse. surprisingly, a moderate interobserver agreement was found between the observer with less experience and the two more experienced observers in the present study when considering all modalities. in the present study, observers  <dig> and  <dig> worked at the same institution, while observer  <dig> worked at another institution. the statistically significant differences in evaluation of debit in observer  <dig> compared to observer  <dig> and  <dig>  indicate that training and working in different institutions influences the evaluation of displaced ivd material markedly. working at different institutions had a greater influence on evaluation than observers’ experience in the present study, probably because differences in training influence the classification accuracy of the nomenclature used in this study.

since the debit-classification system does not have a continuous scale, the cut-off point between two categories is somewhat subjective. thus, each observer independently defines his or her own cut-off point between two classifications. in all methods, differences in evaluation were seen between the normal and the bulging ivd . observers  <dig> and  <dig> defined more ivds as being normal than observer  <dig>  generally, disk bulging is a term which is not often used in veterinary practice, although disk bulging may lead to pain by activating nociceptive innervation due to stretching dorsal anular fibers or the dorsal longitudinal ligament  <cit> . accordingly, all observers dealt with a new term, which had not been discussed previously in their training. that might be one reason for the differences in evaluation. in human medicine, the largest differences in evaluation were seen between the normal and the bulging ivd evaluated by two experienced observers working at the same institution; hence, our results agreed with those of the human studies  <cit> .

variability was found when evaluating disk bulging and disk protrusion . differences in evaluation can result from the choice of image slices for evaluation. an ivd can show a symmetrical extension on one slice whereas on the next image slice a slight, focal rise of annular material may be seen, which can be interpreted as disk protrusion. in the present study image stacks were available for evaluation, so the observer could choose the image used for evaluation. that might have increased the variability in evaluation of disk bulging with respect to disk protrusion, as previously described. discrepancies in evaluation of the bulged versus the protruded human ivds were also seen in the studies of brant-zawadzki et al. and milette et al.  <cit> . in both studies the evaluation was performed by experienced observers working at the same institution, so an increased variability between the bulged and protruded ivd does not seem to depend on the observers’ experience.

the different interpretation of the term sequestration by the observers most likely had a negative influence on the reliability of the debit-nomenclature. using the term sequestration with a different meaning may lead to different results among users. obviously, the definition of the term disk sequestration was not sufficiently precise. thus an exact predefinition of mentioned term is required in future application of debit- nomenclature. we suggest to use the term sequestration for displaced disk tissue without connection to the parental disk, and which is lying not dorsally of the intervertebral disk space.

the most important limitation of the study was the usage of transverse image slices only. although a reconstruction of sagittal- and dorsal-plane slices was possible in the imaging software used, the slice thickness of the transverse stacks was not suitable for reconstruction. having additional image planes might increase the reliability of the evaluation.

in the present study, bowker’s test showed statistically significant differences in evaluation of debit-nomenclature between different observers. therefore, consistency concerning the terms disk protrusion and extrusion was too small to compare debit-nomenclature with hansen’s nomenclature. due to the fact that most canine intervertebral disk herniations can be clinically divided into hansen types  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , further studies with a smaller variation in usage of debit-nomenclature are needed to test whether it can be integrated into the nomenclature proposed by hansen or vice versa.

CONCLUSIONS
debit-nomenclature showed an only moderate reliability in classification of canine displaced ivd material within and between both imaging modalities. therefore, it cannot be recommended for clinical usage yet. the term “disk bulging” was not routinely used by any of the observers. consequently, discrimination between disk bulging and the normal respectively the protruded ivd showed the largest variability. since similar results were found in human medicine, regular practical experience will lower that variability  <cit> . the term “sequestration” was differently interpreted by the observers working at different institutions. therefore a more appropriate definition has to be found for this term. the obvious influence of the observers’ institution on the variability of debit-nomenclature underlines the challenge in introducing a new nomenclature into clinical practice.
