BACKGROUND
increasing crop productivity is a global challenge and is necessary for keeping pace with population growth worldwide  <cit> . more than half of the world’s population is in asia, where rice is grown and consumed as a staple food  <cit> . the predicted population growth in asia will require a 60–70% increase in rice production by  <dig>  but there is insufficient space for a corresponding increase in agriculture  <cit> . to meet the anticipated demand, it is necessary to increase rice production by improving potential rice yield per unit land area.

in the tropics, the yield potential of current high-yielding inbred rice cultivars is  <dig> t · ha− <dig> as unhulled rice under favorable irrigated conditions  <cit> . this yield potential was first attained by ir <dig>  the first modern high-yielding cultivar released by the international rice research institute  in the late 1960s. the release of ir <dig> and subsequent high-yielding cultivars helped to more than double rice production over the past half century. this successful increase in production was called the “green revolution” in rice  <cit> . however, recent trends in yield in tropical environments indicate that yield potential has stagnated since the release of ir <dig>  <cit> .

in temperate japan, high-yielding rice has been developed using the indica and japonica cultivars since the 1980s  <cit> . the latest yield trials, conducted using recently developed high-yielding cultivars, produced nearly  <dig> t · ha− <dig> as brown rice  in eastern japan  <cit>  and > <dig> t · ha− <dig> as brown rice in western japan  <cit> . among the individual trials, a brown rice yield of  <dig>  t · ha− <dig> was reported in western japan  <cit> . to our knowledge, this represents the highest yield recorded in japan to date, and was attained using takanari, a high-yielding indica cultivar. takanari is a semidwarf cultivar descended from high-yielding cultivars including ir <dig>  <cit> . ecophysiological studies have characterized takanari as having large sink size as a result of high spikelet number per panicle, strong source characteristics , and high carbohydrate translocation capacity  <cit> . therefore, it is important to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the high yield potential in takanari to further improve this potential.

over the past two decades, advances in molecular genetics technology using the complete rice genome sequence have facilitated genetic analyses, including the mapping and cloning of quantitative trait loci  that control complex traits  <cit> . chromosome segment substitution lines , which carry a specific donor chromosome segment in the genetic background of a recurrent cultivar, are powerful tools for enhancing the potential of genetic analysis. cssls are appropriate for detecting qtls with both large and small effects that are often masked by other qtls with large effects in primary populations, such as f <dig> populations and recombinant inbred lines  <cit> . because yield is a highly complex trait that is controlled by a large number of qtls with small effects, cssls are useful for understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying this characteristic. to date, several cssls have been developed in rice for several cross combinations  <cit> , including reciprocal cssls  <cit> . reciprocal cssls have the advantage of enabling evaluation of differences in allelic effects of qtls in both genetic backgrounds. however, to our knowledge, genetic analysis of rice yield potential has not been conducted using reciprocal cssls. therefore, the development of reciprocal cssls for yield trials using takanari represents a promising approach.

in this study, we developed reciprocal cssls from a cross between takanari and koshihikari, a leading japonica cultivar, by repeated backcrossing, self-pollinating, and marker-assisted selection . the cssls in the koshihikari background consisted of  <dig> lines covering the entire takanari genome, and these are promising materials for detecting qtls underlying high yield potential in takanari. the cssls in the takanari background consisted of  <dig> lines covering the entire koshihikari genome, and they may enable detection of qtls for increasing yield potential in takanari. yield trials using the reciprocal cssls revealed a number of qtls associated with yield and its components in both genetic backgrounds. our findings provide a foundation for developing rice cultivars with higher yield potential in future breeding programs.

methods
development of the cssls
two rice cultivars, takanari and koshihikari, developed in japan , were used to develop the reciprocal cssls using the procedure summarized in figure  <dig>  we conducted repeated reciprocal backcrossing and performed foreground  selection for the target chromosome segments until the bc3f <dig> generation. from the bc4f <dig> populations, all heterozygous regions were surveyed, and foreground and background selection were combined to select cssls. pcr-based dna markers , including the previously developed gene markers gn1a, sd <dig>  and apo <dig>  <cit> , were used for mas.figure  <dig>

to develop cssls in the koshihikari genetic background, the f <dig> plants derived from a cross between koshihikari and takanari were backcrossed to koshihikari to produce  <dig> bc1f <dig> plants. then, we used mas to select  <dig> bc1f <dig> plants carrying one or two target chromosome segments, based on the genotypes of  <dig> dna markers distributed across the genome. these  <dig> bc1f <dig> plants were again backcrossed to koshihikari to produce bc2f <dig> seeds. we subsequently grew  <dig> bc2f <dig> individuals derived from the  <dig> bc1f <dig> plants, and selected  <dig> bc2f <dig> plants, carrying one or two heterozygous target segments, by mas for the subsequent backcross to koshihikari to produce bc3f <dig> seeds. in the same way,  <dig> out of  <dig> bc3f <dig> individuals derived from the  <dig> bc2f <dig> plants were selected by mas for subsequent backcross to koshihikari to produce bc4f <dig> seeds. we surveyed the genotypes of the  <dig> bc3f <dig> plants by  <dig> genome-wide dna markers for the subsequent target and background selection. then,  <dig> out of  <dig> bc4f <dig> individuals derived from the  <dig> bc3f <dig> plants were selected by mas for all heterozygous regions, including target segments. to obtain candidate plants as cssls homozygous for takanari for the target segments, the  <dig> bc4f <dig> plants were self-pollinated, and the resulting  <dig> bc4f <dig> individuals were surveyed by mas to select  <dig> bc4f <dig> plants. heterozygous segments for the non-target background remained in the  <dig> bc4f <dig> plants, so additional self-pollination and mas were conducted to minimize the proportion of heterozygous regions in the background. finally,  <dig> plants were selected as cssls .

the cssls in the takanari genetic background were developed using the same method as used for the koshihikari background . finally,  <dig> plants were selected as cssls. seeds of the reciprocal cssls can be obtained from the rice genome resource center .

yield trials
yield trials were conducted in the experimental paddy field at the naro institute of crop science, tsukubamirai , ibaraki, japan, in  <dig> and  <dig>  the soils were gleyic fluvisols. reciprocal cssls  and parent cultivars  were cultivated under irrigated conditions. two paddy fields were prepared and each reciprocal cssl was grown in each paddy field. seeds were sown in a seedling nursery box on april  <dig>   <dig>  and april  <dig>   <dig>  and were transplanted  on may  <dig>   <dig>  and may  <dig>   <dig>  respectively. the planting density was  <dig>  hills m− <dig>  with  <dig> cm between hills and  <dig> cm between rows. the experimental plots  were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. basal fertilizer was applied at a rate of  <dig> g n m− <dig> as controlled release fertilizer ,  <dig>  g p m− <dig>  and  <dig>  g k m− <dig>  lp <dig> and lp <dig> release 80% of their total nitrogen content at a uniform rate up to  <dig> and  <dig> days after application, respectively, at 20–30°c. lps <dig> releases 80% of its total nitrogen content at a sigmoid rate up to  <dig> days after application at 20–30°c.

days-to-heading was defined as the number of days from sowing to heading of the first panicle in five plants for each cssl and parent cultivar. at maturity, in mid- to late september, plants covering  <dig>  m <dig>  were harvested from each plot for determination of yield and its components. panicle number was counted and the panicles were threshed to obtain unhulled grains, which were weighed and divided equally into subsamples a and b. approximately  <dig> g of unhulled grains  was selected from subsample a and counted using an electronic seed counter . spikelet number per unit area  was calculated as the grain number in subsample c divided by the weight of subsample c and multiplied by the total weight of the unhulled grains per unit area. spikelet number per panicle was calculated as the spikelet number per unit area divided by panicle number per unit area. the hulls from subsample b were subsequently removed with a rice huller , and the hulled grains were weighed to determine brown rice yield. the grains were then screened using a grain sorter  with  <dig>  mm sieve size and 1000-grain weight was calculated. ripening percentage was calculated from the number of screened hulled grains divided by the spikelet number per unit area. brown rice yield and 1000-grain weight were adjusted to 15% moisture content. culm length was measured for five plants in each cssl and parent cultivar at maturity.

statistical and genetic analyses
statistical analyses were performed using a general linear model with spss  <dig>  . cssl was considered as a fixed effect, and year and replication were considered as random effects. analysis of variance  was conducted to examine the effects of cssl on yield and its components. based on the anova results, significant cssl effects  were explored using dunnett’s test for yield and its components. in the dunnett’s test, koshihikari was used as a control in the koshihikari genetic background and takanari was used as a control in the takanari genetic background. to delineate candidate qtl regions, substitution mapping was conducted by comparing overlapping segments among the cssls according to our previous study  <cit> .

RESULTS
genotypes of the reciprocal cssls
graphical genotypes of  <dig> cssls in the koshihikari background and  <dig> cssls in the takanari background were determined using  <dig> dna markers distributed evenly across the  <dig> rice chromosomes . each chromosome was covered by two to five lines carrying overlapping segments, except for a small region between dna markers rm <dig> and rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> in the koshihikari background, which was not covered because of sterility when we selected a line carrying the segment homozygous for takanari. most cssls carried only one chromosome segment. however, a small segment was substituted in the genetic backgrounds in sl <dig> and sl <dig>  sl <dig> also carried two heterozygous segments and one homozygous segment for koshihikari. the substituted segment size in each cssl ranged from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb in the koshihikari background and from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb in the takanari background.figure  <dig>

climate conditions and variation in days-to-heading in the reciprocal cssls
mean temperatures during the experimental period were similar in  <dig> and  <dig>  and showed a gradual increase as the season progressed, until mid-september . solar radiation was relatively higher in late may and late august in  <dig> compared with  <dig> . koshihikari headed at approximately  <dig> days after sowing, and takanari headed at 102– <dig> days after sowing . in the koshihikari background, sl <dig> and sl <dig> headed approximately  <dig> days earlier and  <dig> days later than koshihikari, respectively. earlier heading in sl <dig> may be derived from the effect of hd <dig>  because the substituted segment in sl <dig> contained hd <dig>  <cit> . late heading in sl <dig> is discussed later. in the remaining  <dig> cssls, days-to-heading ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . in the takanari background, sl <dig> and sl <dig> did not head under the experimental conditions. no heading in sl <dig> may be caused by the effect of hd <dig>  because the substituted segment in sl <dig> contained hd <dig>  <cit> . no heading in sl <dig> may be caused by a new qtl because no qtl has been reported in the substituted region on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  in addition, sl <dig> and sl <dig> headed  <dig> and  <dig> days later than takanari, respectively. late heading in sl <dig> and sl <dig> is discussed later. on the other hand, the remaining  <dig> cssls headed at 97– <dig> days after sowing, which was also within  <dig> days of takanari. therefore, we considered that most cssls and parent cultivars were grown under similar climate conditions.figure  <dig> 
mean temperature and solar radiation. mean temperature  and solar radiation  measured at the experimental paddy field were calculated as the average values from the beginning, middle, and end of each month.



yield and its components in the reciprocal cssls
takanari produced approximately 40% more spikelets per unit area than koshihikari, which was a result of takanari having 30% fewer panicles but twice as many spikelets per panicle . the same ripening percentage was obtained in takanari and koshihikari, although 1000-grain weight was 7% lower in takanari. finally, brown rice yield was 27% higher in takanari than in koshihikari.figure  <dig>

previous studies identified and cloned qtls for sink-size traits , including gn1a  <cit>  and apo <dig>  <cit> , and a semidwarf gene, sd <dig>  <cit> , as a single gene. because we found sequence differences between takanari and koshihikari in these genes , we first focused on the effects of the genes. sl <dig> and sl <dig>  which carried the takanari allele of gn1a in the koshihikari background, produced 33% and 38% more spikelets per panicle and 22% and 23% more spikelets per square meter than koshihikari, respectively . however, these two cssls reduced ripening percentage and 1000-grain weight, and there was no difference in final brown rice yield between these cssls and koshihikari. meanwhile, sl <dig>  carrying the koshihikari allele of gn1a in the takanari background, produced 26% fewer spikelets per panicle and 20% fewer spikelets per square meter than takanari . ripening percentage and 1000-grain weight in sl <dig> were the same as in takanari, and the final brown rice yield in sl <dig> was 22% lower than that in takanari. similar reciprocal effects of apo <dig> were observed for spikelet number per panicle; sl <dig> and sl <dig>  which contained the takanari allele of apo <dig>  produced 19% and 13% more spikelets per panicle, respectively, whereas sl <dig> and sl <dig>  produced 17% and 12% fewer spikelets per panicle, respectively. however, the effects of apo <dig> did not lead to changes in final brown rice yield. reciprocal effects were confirmed for culm length on the sd <dig> gene; sl <dig>  had shortened culms compared with koshihikari, whereas sl <dig> and sl <dig>  had elongated culms compared with takanari . however, no effects of sd <dig> were observed for brown rice yield and its components in the reciprocal backgrounds.

in addition to the cssls carrying gn1a, apo <dig>  and sd <dig>  there were significant differences in brown rice yield and its components between koshihikari and some cssls in the koshihikari genetic background , and between takanari and some cssls in the takanari genetic background . although some cssls had positive values for a yield component, they did not produce significantly higher yield than the recurrent parental cultivar in both backgrounds. for example, sl <dig>  produced 19% more panicles and 20% more spikelets per square meter than takanari, but had reduced ripening percentage and 1000-grain weight. therefore, the final brown rice yield in this cssl was similar to that in takanari.

qtl mapping for yield and its components
we detected  <dig> and  <dig> qtls for yield and its components in the koshihikari and takanari backgrounds, respectively .figure  <dig>

in the koshihikari background, three qtls for panicle number were identified, one of which increased and two of which decreased panicle number in plants with the takanari allele . twelve qtls for number of spikelets per panicle were detected, seven with positive effects and five with negative effects on spikelet number in plants with the takanari allele. considering the effects of the qtls and the chromosomal regions, the loci on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> and on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> were regarded as gn1a and apo <dig>  respectively. six qtls were found for spikelet number per square meter; half of these increased and half decreased the spikelet number in plants with the takanari allele. the five qtls identified for ripening percentage all had negative effects on plants with the takanari allele. sixteen qtls were detected for 1000-grain weight; of these, seven increased and nine reduced the value of this yield component in plants with the takanari allele. six qtls were identified for brown rice yield, and all had negative effects on plants with the takanari allele .

in the takanari background, four qtls were found for panicle number, three of which increased and one of which decreased panicle number in plants with the koshihikari allele . nine qtls for number of spikelets per panicle were detected, and all had negative effects in plants with the koshihikari allele. considering the effects of the qtls and the chromosomal regions, the loci on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> and on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> were regarded as gn1a and apo <dig>  respectively. six qtls were found for number of spikelets per square meter; two increased and four decreased spikelet number in plants with the koshihikari allele. five qtls for ripening percentage had negative effects in plants with the koshihikari allele. nineteen qtls were detected for 1000-grain weight; ten increased and nine decreased 1000-grain weight in plants with the koshihikari allele. four qtls for brown rice yield were identified; all had negative effects on yield in plants with the koshihikari allele.

discussion
rice yield is a highly complex trait and is controlled by a large number of qtls with small individual effects. cssls are appropriate for detecting qtls with both large and small effects, and reciprocal cssls confer the advantage of enabling evaluation of differences in allelic effects of qtls in both genetic backgrounds. if a detected qtl shows the same gene activity in reciprocal genetic backgrounds, that locus should have no genetic interaction or epistasis with other background factor. qtls that show different gene activity in the reciprocal backgrounds may be involved in genetic interaction or epistasis with other background factor  <cit> . by using reciprocal cssls derived from a cross between takanari and koshihikari, we detected a number of qtls underlying brown rice yield and its components. among these loci, we confirmed that the takanari alleles of gn1a and apo <dig> increased the number of spikelets per panicle in the reciprocal backgrounds . a qtl for the number of spikelets per unit area, at rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  and qtls for 1000-grain weight at rm <dig> and rm <dig> on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, exhibited the same gene activity in both genetic backgrounds. these results indicate that these five qtls should be a single factor, unless multiple genes associated with the trait were located in the substituted segment. thus, favorable alleles from these qtls can be used to improve target traits in either of the reciprocal genetic backgrounds. furthermore, a recent study cloned a qtl on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> as gw <dig> controlling grain size  <cit> . because the position of the qtl for 1000-grain weight is close to gw <dig>  there is a possibility that the qtl detected in this study is gw <dig>  further study is necessary to confirm this.

on the other hand, the remaining qtls were detected in only one of the two genetic backgrounds, suggesting that these loci may be under epistatic control with other gene in the background. a possible epistatic interaction was observed for qtl clusters at rm3515- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> in the koshihikari background and at rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> in the takanari background . these qtl clusters were not detected at the same genomic regions in the opposite background. sl <dig>  carrying the qtl cluster on chromosome  <dig>  and sl <dig> and sl <dig>  which carried the qtl cluster on chromosome  <dig>  showed hybrid weakness  . a previous study revealed that hybrid breakdown is caused by interaction of two recessive genes, hbd <dig> and hbd <dig>  and that koshihikari carries hbd <dig> and an indica cultivar, habataki, which is a sister line to takanari, carries hbd <dig>  <cit> . the hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> genes are located in the vicinity of qtl clusters on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. assuming that takanari also carried hbd <dig>  the two qtl clusters and hybrid weakness observed in sl <dig>  sl <dig>  and sl <dig> can be well explained because sl <dig> should have carried hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> in the koshihikari background and sl <dig> and sl <dig> also carried hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> in the takanari background. therefore, the two qtl clusters should be a result of interaction between hbd <dig> and hbd <dig>  although we could not elucidate gene interactions for other qtls detected in only one of the reciprocal backgrounds, detection of many qtls in only one genetic background suggests that a large part of the variation in yield and its components between takanari and koshihikari may be controlled by gene interactions. this is the first study to suggest the possibility of epistatic control of yield and its components on the basis of reciprocal cssls. further studies are necessary to identify background factors that interact with the detected qtls.

mapping of qtls also revealed a trade-off among yield components. a notable example was that the allele of the qtl associated with increased sink size was associated with decreased ripening percentage or 1000-grain weight. this trade-off was observed for seven chromosomal regions in the koshihikari background  and six in the takanari background . the trade-off might be caused by a shortage of source strength or carbohydrate translocation, or might be caused by an imbalance among sink size, source strength, and translocation capacity, resulting in no increase in final yield. a lack of remarkable increase in grain yield was also reported for nils containing the favorable allele of gn1a and apo <dig> in other japonica genetic backgrounds  <cit> . however, it should be noted that the parental cultivar, takanari, obtained a high ripening percentage despite a large sink size derived from the favorable allele of gn1a and apo <dig>  the high ripening percentage in takanari is considered to be caused by the strong source  and high carbohydrate translocation capacity  <cit> . these results suggest that qtls for increased source strength and translocation capacity should be found in the takanari allele and that the combination of gn1a or apo <dig> with these qtls would be necessary to attain higher yield in the koshihikari background. recently, a qtl for high leaf photosynthesis was identified in takanari and cloned as a single gene  in the same genetic combination between takanari and koshihikari  <cit> . we are currently developing a pyramid line carrying gn1a and gps to test yield increase in the koshihikari background.

although the takanari allele of gn1a did not contribute to yield increase in the koshihikari background, the koshihikari allele of gn1a decreased sink size traits  and thus reduced brown rice yield in the takanari background . these results indicate that the takanari allele of gn1a is required to achieve high yield potential in takanari. these results and the strong source in takanari also imply that yield potential in takanari might be increased by enlarging its sink size. we identified a qtl that increased panicle number and spikelet number per square meter on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> in the takanari background . sl <dig>  which carried this qtl, produced 20% more spikelets per square meter than takanari. this is a promising qtl to increase sink size in takanari. however, sl <dig> did not attain higher brown rice yield than takanari, because of reduced ripening percentage and 1000-grain weight . these results indicate that it is necessary, even in the takanari background, to combine the qtl on chromosome  <dig> with loci that enhance source strength and translocation capacity to raise yield potential. although koshihikari has lower leaf photosynthesis than takanari, our previous study detected a qtl for increasing leaf photosynthesis with the koshihikari allele in the takanari background  <cit> . we are currently combining the qtl on chromosome  <dig> with the high-photosynthesis qtl in the takanari background to test the increase in yield potential in takanari, as well as attempting to clone both qtls.

we detected six qtls for yield in the koshihikari background and four in the takanari background, but no qtls for yield common to both backgrounds were detected, and all qtls had negative effects on yield. as discussed above, the failure to detect common qtls might be caused by epistatic control of these qtls. the negative effects might be due to imbalance among sink size, source strength, and translocation capacity caused by the substitution of a qtl. however, the results presented here are based on trials conducted at a single experimental site with a single fertilization treatment. because yield is often influenced by environmental conditions, further trials under multiple environmental conditions are necessary to confirm the effects of the qtls detected in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully developed reciprocal cssls derived from a cross between rice cultivars takanari and koshihikari. genetic analysis by reciprocal cssls confirmed their usefulness and indicated that some qtls for yield and its components represented a single factor, while others may be controlled by epistatic interactions. substitution mapping also suggested the need to combine sink-size qtls with source-strength or translocation-capacity qtls to increase rice yield in both genetic backgrounds. our results provide a foundation for developing rice cultivars with higher yield potential in future breeding programs.
