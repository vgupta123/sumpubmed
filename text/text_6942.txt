BACKGROUND
the transposable element tol <dig> from medaka fish is the first functional transposon identified in vertebrates  <cit> . it belongs to the hat family  and integrates into host dna through a "cut-and-paste" mechanism  <cit> . recently, a non-autonomous tol2-based system has been developed as a tool for genome analysis of vertebrates and for highly efficient transgenesis  <cit> . it has been used for both gene trap and enhancer trap  screens  <cit>  as well as insertional mutagenesis  <cit> . some of these applications have recently been reviewed  <cit> .

one of the features of non-autonomous transposon-based systems, including tol <dig>  is that a transposon integrated into a genome can be remobilized if transposase mrna is available. previous applications of the transposon system have been based on random integration after co-injection of a plasmid dna harboring tol <dig> and transposase mrna. such random integration is attractive for a wide variety of applications ranging from gene discovery to gene therapy. however, the pattern of transposon integration upon remobilization from the donor site can be substantially different from that of plasmid-based integration. for example, the sleeping beauty  transposon has a strong tendency to reinsert during in vivo remobilization at loci closely linked to its donor site  <cit> . such local hopping could be favorable not only for region-specific mutagenesis  <cit>  but also for region-specific probing of enhancers. however, despite the recent surge of interest in the tol <dig> transposon system, its integration and/or reintegration properties have not yet been analyzed in detail.

using tol <dig>  we have previously established a collection of stable transgenic zebrafish et lines and demonstrated that a single copy of a tol <dig> transposon-based et cassette can be remobilized into a new chromosomal location  <cit> . here, we report the results of a genome-wide analysis of tol <dig> reintegration in zebrafish initiated from two genomic sites in two different chromosomes.

RESULTS
design of the tol <dig> transposon remobilization screen
we used two different et lines as donors for the remobilization experiments. the first line, sqet <dig>  was established during our pilot enhancer trap  screen  <cit> . it carries a single insertion of a transposable element in the 3' utr of a novel gene of the zic family, zic <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . the second line, sqet33-e <dig>  was established after induced remobilization of a tol <dig> transposon-based et cassette from the sqet <dig> line  <cit> . it carries a single insertion located approximately  <dig>  kb upstream of a putative gene zgc: <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> . in both lines, stable tissue-specific gfp expression is maintained through at least four generations of breeding, indicating that it is not affected by silencing or epigenetic modification. for both donor lines we confirmed the presence of a single tol <dig> transposon insertion by southern blot hybridization .

in order to induce remobilization of the tol <dig> transposon-based et cassette from the donor site in sqet <dig> , we initially used mrna containing only an open-reading frame  for tol <dig> transposase. in this experiment, transgenic fish homozygous for a single tol <dig> insertion were outcrossed to wild type fish. the embryos from this cross  were injected with transposase mrna at the one- or two-cell stage. most of the injected embryos only showed a "donor-type" gfp expression pattern. however, some showed mosaic expression of gfp in somatic cells, mostly in muscle or skin  <cit> . we did not preselect embryos on the basis of such gfp expression, but used these observations as an indication that a transposition had been triggered. because we were only interested in heritable tol <dig> re-transpositions, the f <dig> generation was not analyzed in respect of transposon integration into somatic cells. all injected embryos were raised to sexual maturity and crossed to wild type fish, and their progeny  were analyzed for changes in gfp expression. we identified injected fish as founders  if their progeny showed a new gfp expression pattern that differed from the donor pattern. the f <dig> founder fish carried the tol <dig> reintegrations in the germline. in our screening scheme, only the f <dig> embryos that showed new gfp expression patterns were further analyzed by tail-pcr . using this strategy, we initially identified  <dig> f <dig> founder fish out of  <dig> injected fish. this corresponded to a 7% apparent germline transposition rate . we assumed that the transposase mrna used at that point was not very effective in tol <dig> remobilization. therefore, in subsequent experiments, we used a modified transposase mrna containing the 5' and 3' utrs of the xenopus β-globin gene  <cit> . as a consequence, we identified  <dig> f <dig> founder fish out of  <dig> injected fish in a new round of screening, a much higher apparent germline transposition rate .

a the sqet <dig> line was used as a donor and mrna containing only an orf for the transposase was injected into embryos. b the sqet <dig> line was used as a donor and transposase mrna containing the 5'- and 3'-utrs of the xenopus β-globin gene was injected into embryos. c the sqet33-e <dig> line, a derivative of sqet <dig>  was used as a donor and transposase mrna containing the 5'- and 3'-utrs of the xenopus β-globin gene was injected into embryos. d fish with transposon reintegration into germline. the progeny  of these fish showed new gfp expression patterns different from the original donor one. e rates are calculated as the percentage of f <dig> founder fish. since we counted only f <dig> fish producing progeny with new gfp expression patterns, these rates are likely to be underestimates. f some f <dig> founder fish have more than one insertion in the germline identified by tail-pcr.

to test whether the donor site influences transposon remobilization, we used the sqet33-e <dig> line  as a donor. we identified  <dig> f <dig> founder fish out of  <dig> injected fish, with an apparent germline transposition rate similar to that of the 2nd screen . because our screening was based on the appearance of new gfp expression patterns, new insertions that caused no changes in that pattern were not taken into account. therefore, the actual germline transposition rate for both donor sites should be higher.

in most cases, when f <dig> fish  were outcrossed to wild type fish, gfp-negative and -positive embryos  were segregated in an approximately 1: <dig> ratio. however, we observed altered gfp segregation ratio following remobilization of the tol <dig> transposon . out of  <dig> injected f <dig> fish ,  <dig> produced more than 50% gfp-positive progeny, suggesting an increase of tol <dig> copy number. thirty-seven injected f <dig> fish produced less than 50% gfp-positive progeny, indicating either partial loss of tol <dig> or silencing of gfp. a similar alteration of gfp segregation has recently been described for re-transposition of the ds element in zebrafish  <cit> . germinal excision without concomitant transposon reintegration has also been reported for the ac/ds transposon in plants  <cit> .

interestingly, about 40% of f <dig> founder fish after outcrossing with wild type produced progeny  such that individual embryos within a single f <dig> family showed distinct new gfp expression patterns. the number of these new patterns per single f <dig> family varied from two to seven, suggesting multiple transposon integration events in the germline of a single f <dig> fish . in most cases, tail-pcr analysis of individual embryos from such f <dig> families demonstrated single tol <dig> insertions at different positions in the genome. the presence of a single insertion in f <dig> fish suggests that transposition occurred independently in separate germline cells, and tol <dig> was transposed by a non-replicative mechanism, since an f <dig> fish is heterozygous for a single insert. however, in a few cases, tail-pcr detected two or three insertions in one f <dig> embryo; this was additionally confirmed by southern blot hybridization .

a f <dig> founder fish were outcrossed to wild type fish and the resulting embryos showing new gfp expression patterns were analyzed by tail-pcr. b the donor insertion retained after reintegration was confirmed by tail-pcr. these are cumulative data from three rounds of screening.

about 20% of f <dig> founder fish produced embryos with the donor-type gfp expression pattern as well as the new gfp expression pattern in the same embryo. in such embryos, donor insertion was always detected by tail-pcr, indicating that the donor copy was retained after retransposition. this result suggests that in some cases remobilization probably occurs during dna replication. transposition during dna replication has been well described for other "cut-and-paste" transposons, particularly for ac/ds  <cit> .

tol <dig> preferentially reintegrates into linked loci
by analyzing the chromosomal distribution pattern of the new insertions , we found that all chromosomes were hit by tol <dig> during re-transposition . about 15% of reintegration events occurred in the donor chromosomes. such a linked pattern of re-transposition was found for both donor sites:  <dig> out of  <dig> insertions were mapped on chromosome  <dig> , while  <dig> out of  <dig> were mapped on chromosome  <dig> . we also found that about 43%  and 24%  of reintegrations occurred less than  <dig> mb from the sqet <dig> and sqet33-e <dig> donor sites, respectively . however, these numbers are probably underestimates, since only transpositions that cause changes in gfp expression patterns were considered.

nd, not determined; un, contig not assigned to any chromosome; p-value was calculated by using a χ <dig> test; n, number of mapped insertions.

we noticed that some chromosomes were possibly favored targets for tol <dig> integration, while others appeared to be disfavored. however, with the exception of the donor chromosomes, only chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig>  were somewhat preferred targets. chromosome  <dig> was found to be a potential cold spot for tol <dig> integration . however, hotspots cannot be adequately evaluated at the chromosomal level at a resolution of  <dig> events. in addition, when all tol <dig> integrations were placed on the zebrafish genome map, there was no indication of significant clustering . in some cases, two independent transposon insertions were mapped within  <dig> to  <dig> kb of one another .

tol <dig> integration into transcription units
sequencing of the pcr-amplified regions that flank the target sites from all founder fish confirmed the generation of novel integration events that were not present in the original donor lines . during the three rounds of screening, we isolated  <dig> transposon integration sites. the genomic positions of  <dig> of these sites were identified using blastn in the ensembl genome browser . however, we could not unambiguously map the remaining  <dig> integration sites because  multiple hits were found that were either very similar or identical to the genomic sequence ,  integrations occurred in repetitive dinucleotide sequences  or  there were sequence gaps in the database . approximately 39% of the mapped integration sites were found within known or predicted genes annotated in the zebrafish genome. about 82% of these sites were mapped within introns and about 18% within exons. there was a bias towards introns because their cumulative size is much larger than that of exons, so they present a much larger target for transposon integration. assuming a 5-kb interval as an arbitrary threshold for the regulatory regions at the 5' and 3' ends of genes, the frequency of integration was about 62% for known or predicted transcription units. furthermore, about 59%  of the "intergenic" insertions were mapped within 50-kb regions upstream or downstream of known or predicted genes annotated in the zebrafish genome. we also compared the distribution pattern of insertions depending on donor site. no significant difference was found .

a for sqet <dig>  donor site data from the 1st and 2nd screens were combined. b frequencies are calculated as the percentages of particular insertions. c we set a 5-kb interval as an arbitrary threshold for a regulatory region at the 5' and 3' ends of a transcription unit. d more than  <dig> kb upstream or downstream of a transcription unit. insertions with no annotated tagged gene were also considered "intergenic".

a include line, long interspersed nuclear element; sine, short interspersed nuclear element. b include microsatellites and minisatellites. these are cumulative data from three rounds of screening.

we found five genes  that were recurrently hit by tol <dig>  two insertions in ensdarg <dig>  were mapped in one intron with a distance of  <dig> kb between the integration sites. similarly, two insertions in zgc: <dig>  were mapped in one intron with a distance of  <dig> kb between the integration sites. two insertions in ensdarg <dig>  were mapped in an intron and  <dig> kb downstream of the gene, while insertions in fgf <dig>  were mapped in two different introns. finally, the two insertions in foxa  were mapped  <dig> kb upstream and  <dig> kb downstream from the gene. four of these five genes  were hit from both independent donor sites. since the sizes of the targeted genes differ substantially , the distance between two independently integrated tol <dig> transposons is more important . we calculated the probability of hitting a similarly-sized locus in the zebrafish genome and then used a binomial distribution test to determine the statistical significance of each targeted locus being hit twice. the p values ranged from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  probably indicating potential hotspots within these genes .

tol <dig> integration into endogenous repeat elements
we analyzed the distribution pattern of tol <dig> insertions with respect to various genomic repeat elements ;  <dig> out of the  <dig> integration sites were found in endogenous repeat elements that are currently annotated in the zebrafish genome. most of these targeted repeat elements belong to dna transposons and to unclassified dr repeats. in addition, our results showed that tol <dig> was less prone to integrate into retrotransposons  and tandem repeats . interestingly, ltr-containing retrotransposons were very seldom targeted by tol <dig> . according to repbase update  <cit> ,  <dig> different families of dna transposons and  <dig> of retrotransposons are currently annotated in the zebrafish genome. retrotransposons that contain ltrs are more diversely represented in the zebrafish genome than those that do not . the differences in targeting of repetitive elements observed in our experiment could be explained by a difference in either the copy number or the global distribution pattern of each class of repetitive elements in the zebrafish genome.

specificity of tol <dig> integration site
some transposable elements exhibit a high degree of integration specificity, while others display relatively little preference for a target dna sequence  <cit> . we analyzed the nucleotide composition over a 48-bp sequence region comprising an 8-bp target site and 20-bp flanking sequences on each side according to  <cit>  . in addition to the  <dig> integration sites isolated in this study, we also included  <dig> integration sites isolated from our previous et screen  <cit> . comparisons among all the tol <dig> integration sites and flanking dna revealed no conserved pattern in the sequences flanking the eight base pair duplication at the integration site. the only exceptions were the nucleotides at ±  <dig> and ±  <dig> bp relative to the integration site, which were 46% and 40% conserved, respectively . in addition, we detected a weak at-rich consensus that contained a palindrome-like core sequence tnattataatna centered at the insertion site . however, only four integration sites were actual palindromes.

discussion
in this study, we analyzed a genome-wide reintegration of the non-autonomous transposable element tol <dig> in zebrafish when it was remobilized from two different donor sites. we showed that the genomic tol <dig> copy can be remobilized upon injection of transposase mrna into the germlines of up to 48% of founders. since we selected only those tol <dig> reintegrations in germlines that caused changes in gfp expression, we in fact measured the "apparent transposition rate"; the actual germline transposition frequency during in vivo remobilization would be higher.

we analyzed tol <dig> integration sites with respect of their chromosomal distribution, integration into intragenic regions and insertion site sequence specificity. although novel integration sites were found on different chromosomes, tol <dig> reintegration was not random. almost 39% of transposon integrations were found within known or predicted genes. most of them were found within introns, as expected in view of the high intron/exon ratio in the zebrafish genome. if we consider insertions into the regulatory regions adjacent to transcriptional initiation and termination sites, the rate of tol <dig> transposition into genes was even higher. since we used the tail-pcr method to isolate transposon inserts, we could not recover all possible tol <dig> insertions in the genome. however, despite of using enhancer trap approach, the frequency with which tol <dig> was integrated within intragenic regions was similar to that found for the sb transposon in human  and mouse  cells  <cit>  and for ac/ds in rice   <cit>  and arabidopsis   <cit> . therefore, tol <dig> is as prone to integrate into transcriptional units as other dna transposons.

our results further demonstrated that about 15% of tol <dig> reintegrations from a specific donor site were linked to the same chromosome. such behavior was also noticed in  <cit> , where about 18% of the mapped integration sites  were located on the donor chromosome. we found that about one third of intrachromosomal reintegrations were located within  <dig> mb of the donor site. however, since we selected reintegrations on the basis of new gfp expression patterns, this number is likely to be lower than the actual number of such transpositions . this local hopping phenomenon has been described for other dna transposons  <cit> . for example, sb is mostly re-integrated within  <dig> mb of the donor site  <cit>  and the local hopping interval of the p element is within  <dig> kb  <cit> . local hopping was also found for the hat family. in this case, more than half of ac transposon reintegrations occurred within  <dig>  mb of the donor site  <cit> . overall, a linked reintegration property of the tol <dig> system might be beneficial for setting a region-specific saturation et screen.

interestingly, our analysis revealed that some chromosomes other than the donor were somewhat preferred targets for tol <dig> integration; still others appeared to be disfavored. such transposon behavior may reflect the spatial chromosomal architecture within the nucleus, if multiple non-adjacent chromosome segments are closely juxtaposed at the nuclear interior or periphery  <cit> . there are many examples of correlations among the intranuclear positions of genes, their clusters and genetic activities, whereas the relative positioning of chromosomes seems to be maintained . therefore, such a property of transposons may potentially be used for analyzing the spatial organization of the genome.

we found that tol <dig> differentially targeted the different classes of endogenous repetitive elements. for example, it more frequently targeted dna transposons than retrotransposons and tandem repeats. the latter tendency contrasts with the profound preference of tc1/mariner transposons for ta-containing microsatellite dna  <cit> . expansion of such repeats during replication slippage can cause repeat instability and increased recombination rates , suggesting that these transposons may use the recombination machinery during integration. like the sb transposon, tol <dig> also avoided retrotransposons containing ltrs. the differences in targeting of endogenous repetitive elements may reflect differences in the copy numbers of each class of repeats, as well as differences among the mechanisms of integration utilized by each transposon family.

we also found that tol <dig> was prone to integrate into at-rich dna regions and that a target site contained a weak palindrome-like consensus sequence. an at-rich palindromic consensus has previously been found in the target sequence of tc1/mariner transposons such as sb in human and mouse cells  <cit>  and the tc <dig> element in worms  <cit> . however, in contrast to the strict preference of sb and tc <dig> for ta dinucleotide targets, tol <dig> has no such preference at the nucleotide level. there is some evidence that distinct preferred transposon integration sites may not necessary match consensus sequences, but rather share similar structural patterns  <cit> . dna structural characteristics such as bending and protein-induced deformability play an important role in directing dna integration  <cit> . dna bending can lead to changes in the width and depth of the major and minor grooves, affecting a protein's access  <cit> . at-rich palindromes are particularly susceptible to local melting and have been experimentally shown to adopt a bendable dna structure  <cit> . in addition, palindromic sequences have the potential to form cruciform configurations, which are an efficient target for rag-mediated transposition  <cit> . also, at-rich palindromic repeats are known to be double-strand break hotspots. it has been proposed that dna bending plays a role in the integration specificity of the hobo transposable element from the hat family, but hobo has no strict preference for targeting at nucleotide level  <cit> . this suggests the likelihood that the target site selection of tol <dig> is primarily determined at the level of dna structure, not sequence.

tol <dig> element transposes by "cut-and-paste" mechanism, which involves the excision and re-integration of the transposon from one site to another, creating an 8-bp duplication of the integration site  <cit> . previously, we found that in one third of tol <dig> excision events, reparation of donor site results in different footprints  <cit> . in our experiments we used extremely high amounts of transposase mrna , therefore it may be reasonable to expect multiple "cut-and-paste" events before transposon will finally settle. such multiple hops could generate double-strand breaks and, as a consequence, the footprints. our analysis of dna sequences flanking the integration/target site revealed no signs of the footprints, at least, at the vicinity  of new integration sites. all dna sequence modifications found at these regions exhibited dna sequence polymorphism between zebrafish strains . however, we could not rule out the possibility that the footprints left after multiple "cut-and-paste" events may be found far away from integration sites.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in a large-scale et screen we analyzed  <dig> insertions generated in the zebrafish genome by remobilization of a single tol <dig> transposon copy from two independent sites on two different chromosomes. about 39% of tol <dig> insertions occurred within genes, mostly in introns. upon remobilization, tol <dig> showed a preference to reintegrate within the chromosome containing the donor site. sequence analysis of integration sites revealed no strict specificity at the nucleotide level, but tol <dig> was prone to integrate into at-rich regions with weak palindrome-like consensus sequences. this information should be carefully evaluated during the design of various follow-up applications that involve tol <dig>  numerous et lines with diverse gfp expression patterns have been generated in this work. they represent a large set of research tools for in vivo studies of vertebrate development, and some have already been successfully used for that purpose  <cit> .
