BACKGROUND
abiotic stresses such as drought, sub-optimal or extreme temperatures and high salinity decrease plant growth and productivity and are responsible for major losses in crop yield  <cit> . incentives for improving abiotic stress tolerance of crops has taken on renewed significance in the face of looming global food shortages that are anticipated consequences of climate change  <cit> . plants that grow in high stress habitats have adaptations that can guide the development of more stress tolerant crops.

plants can exploit different life strategies to cope with their environment  <cit> . specialists may show strong local adaptation to very specific environments while generalists may acquire a more “all purpose” phenotype that allows for plant growth under a broader range of conditions. a third strategy has been described as the adaptive plastic response where a plant with a given genotype can display variable phenotypes that are environment dependent but ultimately contribute to improved fitness  <cit> . plasticity is adaptive when the phenotype induced in each environment results in greater fitness than would the alternative phenotype  <cit> . one difficulty in evaluating the extent to which plasticity plays a role in stress tolerance is that stresses imposed in the laboratory fall short of replicating the complex natural environments that induce adaptive gene by environment interactions  <cit> .

the application of carefully prescribed treatments under controlled laboratory conditions in growth cabinets has successfully identified stress responses and genes whose products are involved in stress tolerance . however, to date few benefits predicted from tolerance traits identified using plants subjected to stress in laboratories have translated directly to improved crop performance under actual field conditions  <cit> . this gap reflects the difficulty of faithfully reproducing the complexities of a natural environment in a growth cabinet  <cit> . for example, the majority of qtls for flowering time identified in growth cabinets are not the same as the ones identified in the field under natural conditions  <cit> .

the importance of phenotyping complex adaptive traits in an ecologically relevant context is highlighted by research on the genetic regulation of the transition to flowering in plants. these “flowering time” genes have largely been discovered using arabidopsis growing in climate-controlled environments and are responsive to cues such as variation in photoperiod or light quality, ambient temperature, plant growth, and vernalization . qtl mapping for date of bolting in chamber conditions as well as at field sites in rhode island and north carolina showed that only a single qtl was common to all environments, several qtl affected flowering time only in controlled environments and a number of novel qtl determined bolting date in the field  <cit> . more recently, genome-wide association analyses with multiple arabidopsis ecotypes concluded similarly that most genes associated with flowering time under climate-controlled conditions were not significant for plants in a field plot in the north of france  <cit> . this outcome underscores the value of validating the role of stress-responsive genes and their products through comparisons involving field and cabinet conditions. with respect to gene expression, studies that have used microarray profiling to compare transcript profiles in plants under controlled conditions to those in field plants show that there are similarities but also major differences among the products found between these sources, underscoring the challenge of selecting suitable genes for crop improvement  <cit> .

the crucifer thellungiella salsuginea , herein referred to as thellungiella, is found on highly saline soil in the yukon territory of canada, a semi-arid, subarctic region. thellungiella exhibits a significant innate capacity to tolerate water deficits, freezing temperatures, and high salinity  <cit> . research on thellungiella has benefited from its close phylogenetic relationship to arabidopsis thaliana <cit>  and it shares many properties of this genetic model plant including small stature, prolific seed habit, capacity for genetic transformation, a relatively short life cycle of six to eight weeks and a compact, fully sequenced, diploid genome . the combination of extreme native environment, high stress tolerance and genetic attributes makes thellungiella an excellent genetic and physiological model for comparative studies involving field and cabinet grown plants.

changes in gene expression and metabolite content have been reported in thellungiella subjected to specific stresses under controlled environment conditions. using a genotype of thellungiella originating from china , salt stress treatments in growth cabinets led to the up-regulation of only six genes compared to  <dig> genes in arabidopsis plants  <cit> . several salt-responsive genes were notable due to their higher constitutive expression in unstressed thellungiella <cit>  compared to arabidopsis. this observation suggests that a number of genes associated with salt exposure are constitutively expressed in thellungiella, resulting in a plant with heightened natural resilience toward salt stress. gene expression patterns have also been reported for the yukon thellungiella ecotype subjected to cold, drought or salinity treatments in controlled environment cabinets  <cit> . exposure to drought stress resulted in the differential expression of  <dig> genes, compared to cold stress  or salt stress . interestingly, only three genes showed increased expression with exposure to each of the three stresses studied leading to the conclusion that thellungiella has rather specific responses to these stresses  <cit> . metabolite profiling of shandong thellungiella responding to osmotic stresses including desiccation and salinity  <cit>  offers a means to link the expression of stress-responsive genes to metabolic phenotypes. for example, shandong thellungiella undergoing salinity stress under controlled environment conditions was shown to accumulate higher levels of proline and sugar alcohols than unsalinized controls and this outcome was associated with the enhanced expression of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in their synthesis  <cit> .

in this study we focused upon thellungiella growing under native yukon field conditions where multiple, concurrent stresses are the norm. we compared gene expression and metabolite profiles of field plants with those subjected to prescribed stress treatments in cabinets  <cit> . in addition to differences in morphology between plants found in the field and those grown in cabinets, we discovered that gene expression and metabolites associated with stress tolerance in growth cabinets are only partially recapitulated under field conditions in the canadian yukon. in particular, while yukon thellungiella plants salt-stressed in growth cabinets produced and accumulated proline in a stress-responsive manner, the proline content in leaves of field plants found growing on highly saline soil was, by comparison, low. using seedlings grown on defined media we show that nitrogen availability can influence the array of organic solutes accumulated by yukon thellungiella under osmotic stress. the natural plasticity displayed by thellungiella from morphology to chemical composition makes this plant a valuable model to test the functional significance of adaptive traits under stress including that associated with proline accumulation.

RESULTS
in this study we used the crucifer thellungiella salsuginea, which is native to the semi-arid, subarctic region of canada, to study gene products expressed under natural conditions and compared them with those identified in plants subjected to regimes of simulated stress in growth cabinets. given the extreme environmental conditions present at our yukon field site compared to tightly controlled conditions in our growth cabinets, we fully expected to find differences that were location-specific. however, we also anticipated that stress-responsive gene products essential for survival under salt, cold, and/or drought conditions should be expressed in plants regardless of whether the plants were grown and stressed in the field or in cabinets.

yukon field site conditions
the season for plant growth in the yukon territory of canada is typically short and for thellungiella this extends from early may to late july . in  <dig> we developed sampling and shipping protocols suitable for rna and metabolite extractions after collecting specimens from remote field locations. we then collected plants at a field site located approximately  <dig> km nw of whitehorse returning to the same site over 1- to 2-week periods in early july  <dig> and late june  <dig> 

at the field site thellungiella plants grow on soil encrusted with salt deposits. soil at the site is composed of an upper, mineral-organic layer approximately  <dig> cm deep that overlays a clay horizon. chemical analysis of the upper layer  shows the soil to be highly alkaline with a ph of  <dig>  and saline . this soil is high in magnesium, sodium and sulfates, a feature shared by other saline soils in the area  <cit> . with respect to other nutrients, the soil has adequate levels of potassium and phosphorus , whereas the total nitrogen content is low . the ca/mg ratio is less than  <dig> , characteristic for a serpentine soil while a typical soil usually has a ca/mg ratio exceeding  <dig>  .

for the whitehorse, yukon area, the average temperature for the growing season in  <dig> and  <dig> was approximately 20°c . in  <dig>  average high and low temperatures for the ten-day period prior to harvest were 22°c and 15°c, respectively. at the field site on the day of harvest, soil temperature was 17°c, the air temperature was 24°c, and the light intensity was  <dig> μmoles m– <dig> s– <dig>  in  <dig>  the average high and low temperatures for the ten-day period before harvest were 18°c and 7°c, respectively. at the field where plants were collected in  <dig>  the soil temperature was 18°c, the daytime air temperature was 24°c, and the light intensity was  <dig> μmoles m– <dig> s– <dig> 

the average cumulative precipitation for this region is  <dig>  mm from may through july, the growing season for thellungiella, classifying this area as semi-arid . in  <dig>  however, total precipitation prior to harvest was 50% lower than the long-term norms and, as such, can be considered a drought year even for a semi-arid region . in contrast, precipitation prior to the  <dig> harvest was  <dig> -fold greater than the long-term norms. thus prevailing levels of light and temperature during harvest for the two years were comparable but precipitation was very low in  <dig> relative to  <dig> 

thellungiella plants in the field and in growth chambers have different phenotypes
the natural accession of thellungiella found in the yukon exhibits a different phenotype in situ than in cabinet growth conditions. in growth cabinets set to mimic the temperature range and summer day length of the yukon, plants produced from seed collected from the same yukon field site develop multiple  basal rosette leaves  with flowers first appearing at about  <dig> to  <dig> weeks as a small cluster within the rosette. plants usually bolt at about six weeks after germination and additional flowers are borne on a main stem. at about  <dig> weeks, axillary stems bearing flowers appear and occasional cauline leaves develop on the main and axillary stems with the basal rosette leaves remaining a prominent feature. in contrast, thellungiella at field sites have prominent cauline leaves that clasp around the main and axillary flowering stems and either lack or have only a few, diminutive rosette leaves . chemical analysis of leaf tissue shows n, ca++, and mg++ contents to be similar for cabinet and field-grown plants, but the na+ content of leaves harvested in the field is over six-fold higher than that of the cabinet-grown control plants .

plants collected in  <dig> experienced below-average precipitation in a  <dig> d period before harvest. in the same timeframe, plants collected in  <dig> experienced more frequent episodes of rainfall leading to above-average cumulative precipitation. the contrasting precipitation patterns allowed us to compare field plants exposed to water deficits in  <dig> with those experiencing above-normal cumulative precipitation in  <dig>  figure 1c shows the grass surrounding thellungiella to be dead or dying in  <dig>  thellungiella plants were small  but green and either flowering or setting seed. in contrast, at the same site in  <dig> the above-average precipitation patterns contributed to an abundance of green vegetation around the thellungiella plants that were themselves almost 2- to 3-fold larger than the plants found in  <dig> .

profiling of thellungiella plants grown under field conditions
to prepare transcript profiles of field plants we used a cdna microarray containing  <dig> unique sequences derived from libraries enriched in stress-responsive cdnas as described in wong et al.  <cit> . field expression data was quantified relative to the signal intensity of control cdna prepared from cauline leaves of plants grown in controlled environment chambers. of the gene products represented on the microarray,  <dig>  were differentially expressed within cauline leaves of thellungiella growing in the field relative to cabinet-grown controls . in  <dig>  transcripts associated with  <dig> cdnas were differentially expressed with  <dig> and  <dig> being present at higher or lower levels, respectively, relative to cabinet-grown plants. for plants sampled in  <dig>  transcripts associated with  <dig> genes were differentially expressed with  <dig> and  <dig> being present at higher or lower levels, respectively, relative to plants grown in chambers. of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in field samples, only 7% were expressed at higher levels over chamber-grown controls in both years and 6% were expressed to a lesser extent in both field years.

given the diversity of environmental conditions possible at this field site in the yukon, it is reasonable to ask whether thellungiella plants that have adapted to life in a harsh climate manifested a stress response during either year relative to our cabinet-grown controls. to address this question, we classified genes showing differential expression in  <dig> or  <dig> compared to cabinet controls by the biological processes and molecular functions encoded by their products according to the gene ontology  annotations  . the theoretical expectation for a proportion of genes classified by go biological process for “response to stress or biotic stimulus” and “response to stress” given the coding potential of the arabidopsis genome is  <dig> %  and for unigenes represented on our microarray chip is 8%  <cit> . the go biological process categorizes  <dig> of the  <dig>  genes showing differential expression in plants sourced from the field relative to chamber-grown plants as being associated with stress . however, gene products classified as stress-responsive comprised a two-fold greater proportion of the transcripts showing enhanced expression in  <dig>  compared to  <dig> , consistent with thellungiella plants in  <dig> being more stressed than plants in  <dig> . this interpretation of the functional gene classification is corroborated by size and physiological measurements of the field plants. field-grown thellungiella sampled in  <dig> were of small stature  and plants had a lower solute potential than either cabinet-grown plants or plants collected in  <dig> indicating that they had accumulated solutes to a greater extent. specifically, at approximately  <dig> weeks of age, a well-watered yukon plant in the growth cabinet has a cauline leaf solute potential  of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mpa, a comparatively low value for an unstressed plant  <cit> . in comparison, visibly turgid cauline leaves from field plants were - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mpa and - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mpa in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. interestingly, go classification by molecular function shows that genes encoding proteins of unknown function were expressed at a proportionately higher level in  <dig> while the kinase class made little to no contribution .

patterns among gene products of field-grown thellungiella and cabinet-grown plants subjected to environmental stress
the microarray dataset reported by wong et al  <cit>  for yukon thellungiella plants subjected to stress treatments under cabinet conditions was used in a meta-analysis for comparison with the expression profiles of field plants. among the  <dig> genes described above, only  <dig> genes showed differential expression in the field and in response to at least one growth cabinet stress treatment. there were  <dig> genes differentially expressed in leaf samples collected in  <dig> and  <dig> that were not differentially expressed following any of the growth cabinet imposed stresses. this subset of  <dig> genes was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis  to discern patterns of differential gene expression between field and cabinet stress treatments with the understanding that  <dig> was a more stressful year. the dendrogram at the top of the hca shown in figure  <dig> groups the two gene expression datasets obtained from field plants together into a single group. the dataset that shows the greatest difference from the others is the one derived from re-watered plants recovering from a simulated drought stress. the top half of the figure includes genes whose transcripts were down-regulated  in the field relative to control, cauline leaves of cabinet-grown plants while the bottom half includes genes found to be more highly expressed  in the field. the first six genes at the top of the figure show comparatively strong stress-responsive expression in plants from growth cabinets exposed to cold or drought treatments but they showed no increased abundance in cauline leaves of field plants relative to chamber-grown plants for either year sampled. other genes show changes in expression that support a role in stress acclimation in both field and cabinet grown plants. for example, a group of seven genes at the base of the hca heat map showed increased expression in  <dig> and in leaves of plants re-watered following drought treatment in cabinets but showed no increase in expression in  <dig> or following drought, cold or salinity treatments in cabinets. this group may be comprised of genes whose expression is down-regulated during stress or associated with plants growing under more favorable cabinet and field conditions such as those of  <dig> 

we expect that genes whose products are critical for growth under a given stress condition will be expressed irrespective of whether the plants are grown and stressed in cabinets or in the field. this premise can be tested using the dataset for differentially expressed genes . for example, genes responsive to water deficits are less likely to show differential expression in  <dig> when rainfall was abundant. on the other hand, plants harvested in  <dig> and chamber-grown plants exposed to a simulated drought should show overlap in drought-responsive genes. figure 4a shows a venn diagram of drought-responsive genes in the growth cabinet and their overlap, if any, with differentially expressed genes in  <dig> or  <dig>  a number of interesting inferences can be drawn considering that  <dig> was a year of low precipitation. firstly, approximately  <dig> -fold more differentially expressed genes were only detected in  <dig> and given the ample rainfall, their expression is inconsistent with genes whose products are responsive to drought; their expression must reflect other field-related conditions in  <dig>  we found  <dig> genes showing drought-responsive behavior in cabinets although cold and salinity also influenced the expression of many of these genes. only a subset of  <dig> genes  showed differential expression in  <dig> samples and in drought-treated plants in growth chambers. of this group,  <dig> genes were not responsive to either salinity or cold and the direction of change was the same . the expression pattern of this sub-set of thellungiella genes suggests that they are responsive to water deficits whether engineered under controlled conditions in a cabinet or naturally in the field. of these  <dig> genes, the functions associated with several are unknown but a number have documented roles in osmotic stress . the genes of unknown function deserve further study as their expression patterns implicate these products in processes required to tolerate water deficits under stressful field conditions.

metabolite profiling of thellungiella plants grown under field conditions
the go annotation analysis of figure  <dig> shows that transcripts associated with metabolism comprise one of the largest categories of differentially regulated genes in thellungiella field plants. in order to gain greater insight into the biochemical activities of these plants we extracted and profiled polar metabolites by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry . using this approach, it was possible to simultaneously monitor over  <dig> mass spectral tags  corresponding to chemically diverse compounds.

plant metabolites can undergo diurnal changes in abundance  <cit> . with this consideration and the restricted access to the field site, it was important to identify which metabolites undergo diurnal changes in abundance and the time point that would provide the most comprehensive “snapshot” of chemical components. we sampled leaf tissue harvested at the field site at three time-points corresponding to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after sunrise. measurements of mst abundance at any given time point were expressed as an average fold-change of the three time points selected for tissue analysis and the  <dig> msts found to undergo significant changes in abundance were analyzed by hca . the majority of the compounds that underwent changes in content showed maximum abundance in the samples obtained  <dig> h after sunrise. this group includes myo-inositol, raffinose, galactinol, quinic acid, fructose, sucrose, and  <dig> unidentified msts. members of the raffinose family oligosaccharides have been implicated in desiccation and freezing tolerance of a variety of plants. while one might expect the content of protective compounds to remain stable in the face of a persistent osmotic stress, such as that found at a highly saline field site, diurnal changes have been observed for myo-inositol, fructose, and raffinose for unwatered coleus  <cit>  and so diurnal changes in these components neither supports nor precludes a role for raffinose family oligosaccharides in osmotic adjustment of thellungiella. a smaller group whose abundance was highest in early morning  samples included phosphate, citrate, glycine, and unknown  <dig> while one mst, unknown  <dig>  was most abundant in the late time-point sample . given the difficulty of sampling at a remote field site and the pattern of highest abundance tending to be near midday, we selected a single time-point corresponding to  <dig> h after sunrise for routine sampling and synchronized this sampling time for comparisons with plants in growth cabinet material. our findings agree with those of gibon et al.  <cit>  who reported that metabolite abundance in arabidopsis is relatively low early in the day and increases over the course of the day.

we found  <dig> msts in leaf extracts prepared from plants collected in  <dig> and  <dig> that showed statistically significant differences in abundance relative to msts present in extracts of cauline leaf samples from chamber-grown controls . a subset of  <dig> msts that showed changes in abundance in field plants only, or between field and cabinet stress treatment samples, were subjected to hca . a striking impression shown by this hca is that most components, including  <dig> msts tentatively identified as sugar alcohols, were less abundant in leaves of field plants than cauline leaves from growth cabinet control plants. leaves harvested from thellungiella growing on saline field sites in  <dig> and  <dig> had a higher content of citrate, unknown  <dig>  succinate, ethanolamine, glycine, citramalate, sucrose, and fructose compared to cauline leaf controls. none of the laboratory stress conditions tested led to an increased relative abundance of the first four msts in this list. among the low abundance metabolites in field samples were some found to be present at higher levels following at least one of the stress treatments in cabinets. this latter group includes cinnamic acid, raffinose, aspartate, valine, isoleucine, galactinol, proline, serine, and glutamate.

physiological adjustments to salt exposure include plasticity in organic solutes accumulated by yukon thellungiella plants
a general mechanism for tolerance to osmotic stress among plants involves the accumulation of organic solutes to serve various roles including scavenging free radicals, detoxification and osmotic adjustment  <cit> . there is ample experimental evidence that the shandong ecotype of thellungiella accumulates proline in response to nacl treatments, a trait observed in numerous plant species,  <cit> . in contrast, we found little evidence that thellungiella plants harvested at the yukon field site contained proline at levels exceeding those found in rosette leaves of well-watered chamber-grown plants . this outcome was unexpected because our soil analysis and visual observations of the field location show that the plants are growing under saline conditions . tissue sampled from the field was enriched in na+ compared to cabinet controls and leaf ψs values from field plants were lower than non-salinized plants in growth chambers. furthermore, our hca of differentially expressed genes between field and chamber-grown plants  does not implicate gene products associated with proline synthesis under stress such as the thellungiella ortholog of Δ 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase  <dig> <cit> .

we further explored the relationship between nacl treatment of plants in cabinets and proline accumulation by comparing yukon thellungiella plants that were well watered with those that were salinized step-wise up to  <dig> mm nacl. thellungiella salinized in growth cabinets will flower and set seeds even when irrigated with  <dig> mm nacl. the salinized plants showed a reduction in leaf ψw and ψs but remained turgid  and the proline content of leaves underwent a salt-responsive increase . although this experiment confirmed the capacity for yukon thellungiella to accumulate proline in growth cabinets, it did not satisfactorily answer why we failed to observe proline accumulate to comparable levels in the field plants . we hypothesized that field-related conditions influence the nature of solutes accumulated by yukon thellungiella plants, with one factor being the availability of nutrients. there is evidence that nitrogen can influence the organic solute composition of salt-stressed spartina alterniflora and wollastonia biflora <cit> .

nitrogen availability influences the array of solutes accumulated by yukon thellungiella during salt exposure
given the low nitrogen content of soil at the field site , we reasoned that nitrogen availability could influence the production and accumulation of proline by plants in the field when compared to plants in the cabinets that were fertilized weekly. to address this question we grew seedlings on defined nutrient media and subjected them to one of four treatments:  <dig> mm nitrogen ,  <dig>  mm nitrogen ,  <dig> mm nitrogen and  <dig> mm nacl , or  <dig>  mm nitrogen and  <dig> mm nacl . arabidopsis seedlings were stunted on hn + s and died on ln + s treatment plates. in contrast, thellungiella seedlings exposed to  <dig> mm nacl survived and grew under both hn and ln conditions . thellungiella growth was slower on media containing nacl compared to media without added salt. the length of thellungiella seedling primary roots was measured daily. thellungiella roots grown in the absence of salt  grew at the same rate of  <dig>  mm. d- <dig> while those exposed to  <dig> mm nacl  grew at  <dig>  mm·d- <dig>  half the rate of the non-salinized seedling roots . the nitrogen concentration of the media therefore did not affect primary root growth rate but the presence of added salt led to slower rates of root elongation. shoot fresh weight measurements were taken on the day of harvest, defined as the day that primary roots reached the bottom of a vertically-oriented agar plate. the salinized roots grew more slowly and, accordingly, shoot tissue was collected from ln and hn seedlings at  <dig> d and from ln + s and hn + s seedlings at  <dig> d . at harvest, shoot biomass was two-fold greater for seedlings grown on hn media compared to ln plates and this difference was not affected by salt .

gc/ms was used to identify qualitative and quantitative changes in organic solutes extracted from harvested shoots. we identified  <dig> msts as showing significantly different relative abundance between the four treatments;  <dig> were identified as probable sugars based upon mass spectral information but  <dig> could not be associated with any chemical class .

abundance estimates for the  <dig> msts across the four treatments were subjected to principal component analysis . pca simplifies the large volume of data  and helps reveal sources of major variation in mst abundance  <cit> . pc <dig>  and pc <dig> together account for 87% of the variance in the observations corresponding to the four treatments tested, with pc <dig> accounting for  <dig> % .

on this pca, observations obtained from individual plants exposed to the same test media group together , suggesting that variance between treatments was greater than variance within treatments. observations derived from seedlings grown in the absence of salt  and those from plants grown in the presence of salt  are discriminated along the pc <dig> axis, indicating that pc <dig> is primarily associated with variance in metabolites due to seedling salt exposure. observations derived from the ln and ln + s are separated from hn and hn + s treatments along the pc <dig> axis, indicating that pc <dig> is associated with variance due to seedling exposure to nitrogen .

the pca data was analyzed further to identify metabolite variables that influence the position of the observations along pc <dig> and pc <dig>  projections of metabolite variables onto the two principal components yielded values near the origin for the majority of metabolites . however, ten of the  <dig> variables were clearly separable from the rest and these included fructose, myo-inositol, sugar  <dig> and raffinose. these particular variables lie below zero on the pc <dig> axis and contribute towards the position of the ln + s observations. points corresponding to the variables pyroglutamic acid and serine are found on the left side of the pc <dig> axis and above zero on the pc <dig> axis where they contribute to the position of the hn observations. in contrast, proline has a strong positive loading for both pc <dig> and pc <dig> axes and so contributes to the position of the hn + s observations. these results show that a change in abundance among comparatively few msts strongly influenced the position and separation of observations produced following pca of mst data from the thellungiella seedlings used in this study. furthermore, much of the variance in this dataset is due to seedling proline content. additional file  <dig> shows that the 45-fold increase in proline abundance between hn and hn + s plants can be contrasted with the fold-increases for several sugars between ln and ln + s plants . this observation is consistent with our hypothesis that carbohydrates replace proline when plants are salt-stressed under nitrogen limiting conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
even for a plant that grows in a high stress environment, there was considerable plasticity in variance to abiotic stressors. predictably, in our comparisons between field- and cabinet-grown thellungiella plants we found many differences in gene expression and metabolite content. however, there were consistent patterns among stress-responsive transcripts and metabolites that strongly associate a subset of gene products with a role in the adaptive capacity of this plant to survive on saline soils and under drought conditions. the converse is also true. one trait that has a long association with stress tolerance, including salinity tolerance of thellungiella <cit> , is that of proline accumulation. surprisingly, we found no evidence for elevated proline content in leaves of plants that grew in salt-laden yukon soils despite the fact that plants descended from seeds of the same population grown in cabinets accumulate this amino acid in a stress-responsive manner. in this report we show evidence that for at least this trait, the availability of nutrients influences the array of organic solutes accumulated by thellungiella growing under saline conditions. we propose that this plasticity is not an exclusive property of proline metabolism but a trait that reflects a more fundamental flexibility required for thellungiella’s extremophile lifestyle. as such, we hypothesize that stress-responsive traits in common between field and growth cabinet locations is not a serendipitous overlap but likely reflects their essential requirement for stress tolerance. comparisons between field and laboratory grown plants offer a promising approach to revealing candidate gene leads for improved crop performance under adverse environmental conditions.
