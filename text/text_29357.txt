BACKGROUND
arginine methylation is a post-translational modification whose importance and widespread impact has recently begun to be fully appreciated  <cit> . in yeast and mammals, arginine methylation has been associated with a diversity of cellular processes including signal transduction  <cit> , rna transport  <cit>  and processing  <cit> , protein localization  <cit> , and transcription  <cit> . the effects of arginine methylation on these processes are exerted primarily through the modulation of protein-protein and, less often, protein-nucleic acid interactions  <cit> . common sites of arginine methylation within proteins include rgg, rg, or rxr motifs  <cit> , although methylation of arginine also occurs within other sequence contexts  <cit> . catalysis of arginine methylation is carried out by a family of enzymes termed protein arginine methyltransferases [prmts). while these enzymes are apparently absent from prokaryotes, putative prmts have been identified in the genomes of all eukaryotes examined with the exception of giardia lamblia <cit> .

prmts are classified into four types. both type i and ii prmts catalyze the formation of ω-ng monomethylarginine . type i enzymes subsequently synthesize ω-ng,ng asymmetrical dimethylarginine , while the type ii enzymes form ω-ng,n’g symmetrical dimethylarginine . type iii and type iv enzymes catalyze the formation of only ω-ng monomethylarginine  or δ-ng monomethylarginine, respectively. in humans, nine prmts have been confirmed, most of them being type i enzymes  <cit> . in contrast to what has been described in humans, only three prmts have been described in saccharomyces cerevisiae, one each of type i type ii, and the apparently fungal-specific type iv  <cit> . most protozoa with the exception of giardia who lacks putative ptmts, are predicted to possess at least one type i and one type ii prmts  <cit> .

trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protozoan and the causative agent of african sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in african livestock. the genome of t. brucei predicts the presence of five prmts  <cit> , a relatively large number for a single celled organism  <cit> . these prmts, with the exception of the putative type i tbprmt <dig>  have previously been characterized. tbprmt <dig> is the major type i prmt in t. brucei, analogous to its role in yeast and mammals  <cit> . tbprmt <dig> is a type ii enzyme homologous to human prmt <dig>  <cit> . tbprmt <dig> is a novel, kinetoplastid-specific type iii prmt  <cit> . finally, the recently characterized tbprmt <dig> is a type i prmt capable of automethylation  <cit> . to date, only a few arginine methylproteins have been reported in t. brucei. these include the mitochondrial rna binding proteins rbp <dig>  tbrgg <dig>  tbrgg <dig>  and mrp <dig>  the effects of rbp <dig> methylation have been characterized. rbp <dig> is a tbprmt <dig> substrate, as shown by in vitro methylation assays and the hypomethylated state of rbp <dig> in tbprmt <dig> knockdown cells  <cit> . arginine methylation affects the ability of rbp <dig> to stabilize specific mitochondrial rnas and exerts both positive and negative impacts on the interaction of rbp <dig> with different classes of rnas and ribonucleoprotein complexes  <cit> . in addition, a large number of proteins harboring arginine/glycine rich regions likely to undergo methylation are predicted by the t. brucei genome, and several t. brucei rna binding proteins serve as tbprmt substrates in vitro <cit> . this indicates that a large number of proteins whose functions are modulated by arginine methylation await discovery in trypanosomes.

to gain insight into functions of arginine methylation in trypanosome gene regulation, we set out to identify substrates of the major t. brucei type i prmt, tbprmt <dig>  we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the entire tbprmt <dig> open reading frame as bait, exploiting the propensity of prmts to associate in a relatively stable manner with their substrates  <cit> . using this approach, we identified a protein containing two conserved domains found in a family of proteins known as lipins. lipins are involved in adipocyte development and phospholipid biosynthesis in mammalian and yeast cells. we termed this protein tblpn. while these two domains, known as n-lip and c-lip domains, are found in several mammalian and yeast lipin proteins  <cit> , tblpn possesses no homology to known proteins outside these two domains and is, thus, a kinetoplastid-specific protein. consistent with the yeast-two-hybrid data, we show that tblpn interacts in vivo with tbprmt <dig>  and that it is methylated on arginine residues in vivo. we also show that, as predicted by the presence of conserved domains, tblpn displays phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity in vitro, and that the two conserved aspartic acid residues present in the c-lip domain, are essential for enzymatic activity.

RESULTS
identification of tblpn as a tbprmt1-interacting protein
to begin to understand the functions of protein arginine methylation in trypanosomes, we sought to identify proteins that interact with the major type i prmt in t. brucei, tbprmt <dig>  prmts tend to associate in a relatively stable manner with their substrates, and several mammalian methylproteins have been identified through protein-protein interaction screens with prmts  <cit> . to identify tbprmt1-interacting proteins, we screened a yeast-two-hybrid library comprised of mixed procyclic  and bloodstream form  t. brucei cdna  <cit>  using the entire tbprmt <dig> orf as bait. approximately  <dig> colonies that grew under moderate selection on sd medium  were selected for more stringent screening on sd medium .

one of the colonies isolated from this screen contained a  <dig> -nucleotide insert, which we identified as a fragment of t. brucei gene tb <dig> . <dig>  . the predicted protein encoded by this gene contains an n-lip domain at its amino terminus, as well as a c-lip domain extending from amino acid 441– <dig>  these  <dig> domains are found in a family of proteins known as lipins . lipin- <dig>  the first member of this family, was identified in the mouse by positional cloning of the mutant gene responsible for fatty liver dystrophy   <cit> . in addition, the fld mice also exhibit hypertriglyceridemia, increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and peripheral neuropathy  <cit> . lipin proteins are present in organisms from a wide evolutionary spectrum, including protozoa, yeast, drosophila, fish, and mammals   <cit> . tblpn homologues can be identified in other trypanosome genomes such as trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania major, and these proteins display between 32– <dig> % amino acid identity with tblpn  <cit> . the members of the lipin family serve two major cellular functions: as an enzyme necessary for phospholipid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis, and as a transcriptional cofactor involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism genes  <cit> . in addition, lipin homologues have been shown to play an essential role in nuclear membrane biogenesis in yeast  <cit> .

to begin to characterize tblpn, we amplified the complete predicted orf from pf cdna. sequence analysis revealed six nucleotide differences from the tb <dig> . <dig> sequence reported in genedb, three of which result in amino acid changes . the predicted tblpn protein is  <dig> amino acids in length  with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the n-lip domain of tblpn displays 30– <dig> % amino acid identity with the corresponding domains from lipin proteins . in addition, the c-lip domain of tblpn exhibits 46-50% amino acid identity with the corresponding domains from members of lipin family, such as mammalian lipin- <dig>  lipin- <dig>  lipin- <dig>  and yeast smp <dig> . most interesting, the motif  shown to confer phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity to mammalian and yeast lipins, is present within the c-lip domain of tblpn   <cit> . in addition, a conserved glycine residue shown to be essential for the mouse lipin- <dig> function is also present in the predicted amino acid sequence of tblpn   <cit> . apart from this domain, no significant homology is observed between tblpn and other members of the lipin family. for instance, although lipin proteins share the lxxil motif, which has been shown to be essential for interaction of lipin- <dig> with the nuclear cofactors involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, tblpn lacks that conserved lxxil motif, suggesting that tblpn might have a different function than other lipins  <cit> . although tblpn may not possess co-transcriptional activity, it might still act as a phosphatidic acid phosphatase. in addition, the conserved nuclear localization sequence, usually found in almost all species  <cit> , is absent in tblpn.

subcellular localization of tblpn
to determine the subcellular localization of tblpn, pf t. brucei cells were fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear extracts, and the presence of tblpn within these compartments assessed by western hybridization. the efficiency of the fractionation procedure was confirmed by using antibodies directed against cytosolic hsp <dig> and nuclear rna polymerase ii. as shown in figure  <dig>  a band of the expected size for tblpn  was present exclusively in the cytoplasm of the parasite. this is in contrast to all previously characterized mammalian and yeast lipins which display cytoplasmic as well as nuclear localization  <cit> . in addition, smp <dig>  the yeast lipin homologue, has been shown to be present in the cytosol as well as associated with the membrane  <cit> . we did however detect the presence of a protein band with decreased electrophoretic mobility  in the nuclear extract. this strongly suggests that tblpn is present in both cytosol and nucleus and, in the nucleus, is heavily modified by post-translational modifications such as arginine methylation and/or phosphorylation.

tblpn interacts with tbprmt <dig> in vitro and in vivo
we further confirmed the tbprmt1/tblpn interaction identified by yeast-two-hybrid first by far western hybridization. to this end, recombinant his-tblpn was electrophoresed and transferred to pvdf, and the membrane was incubated with recombinant his-tbprmt <dig>  detection of his-tbprmt <dig> with polyclonal anti-tbprmt <dig> antibodies revealed the presence of a band at  <dig> kda, which is the predicted size of his-tblpn, thereby demonstrating direct binding of his-tbprmt <dig> to his-tblpn . as a negative control, his-rbp <dig>  expressed and purified using the same protocol as for the purification of his-tblpn, was used. using this negative control, no band was detected. the data indicate that tblpn and tbprmt <dig> interact directly.

in order to examine the interaction between tbprmt <dig> and tblpn in vivo, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation. as shown above, tblpn is located in the cytosol of the parasite. for this reason, tblpn was immunoprecipitated from pf t. brucei cytosolic extracts using purified polyclonal anti-tblpn antibodies. proteins that were immunoprecipitated along with tblpn were separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto pvdf. the presence of tprmt <dig> in association with tblpn was determined by using purified polyclonal anti-tbprmt <dig> antibodies to probe the membrane by western hybridization. the results shown in figure 4b clearly show that a band of approximately the size of tbprmt <dig>  co-precipitates exclusively with tblpn, and is not present in the negative control.

tblpn is methylated in vivo
the physical association of tbprmt <dig> with tblpn suggests that tblpn may serve as a substrate for methylation by tbprmt <dig>  in support of this hypothesis, several arginine residues throughout the tblpn sequence are located within preferred motifs for methylation, such as rg or rxr. to evaluate whether tblpn is methylated in vivo, an immunoprecipitation was performed from pf t. brucei cytosolic extracts using purified anti-tblpn polyclonal antibodies. the presence of methylated arginine residues was then determined by western hybridization using anti-mrg polyclonal antibodies. these antibodies were raised against a peptide containing  <dig> asymmetric dimethylarginine residues alternating with  <dig> glycine residues. this motif is found most prevalently among verified dimethylarginine- containing proteins. the antibodies have been shown to specifically recognize methylated arginine residues  <cit> . using these antibodies to probe the blot, a protein band was observed at  <dig> kda, which is the predicted size of tblpn, in the bound but not the unbound fraction . this clearly indicates that native tblpn contains methylated arginine residues. this result, in conjunction with the ability of tblpn to interact with tbptmt <dig> in vivo, suggests that one or several arginine residues within tblpn might be asymmetrically dimethylated by tbprmt <dig>  further experiments are underway to identify the enzyme responsible for tblpn methylation.

tblpn displays phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity in vitro
lipin proteins are known to exhibit mg2+-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity, catalyzing dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid  into diacylglycerol. the predicted amino acid sequence of tblpn contains two conserved domains found in all lipins. in addition, two aspartic acid residues that have been shown to be essential for enzymatic activity of yeast and mammalian lipins are also found in tblpn. to determine whether recombinant tblpn could catalyze dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid, enzymatic assays were performed using the substrate  <dig> -dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate , mg2+, and increasing amount of his-tblpn. following incubation at 30°c, the amount of pi released was measured by reading the absorbance at  <dig> nm following the addition of piblue reagent. figure  <dig> shows that recombinant tblpn exhibits phosphatidate phosphatase activity, suggesting that tblpn may play a role in the synthesis of phospholipids. from our data, we calculated that recombinant tblpn has a specific activity of 200– <dig> nmol/min/mg. in contrast, the recombinant mutant in which the two conserved aspartic acid residues  were changed to alanines  shows significantly less phosphatase activity. the calculated specific activity of 11– <dig> nmol/min/mg calculated for the mutant protein clearly implies that the two conserved aspartates are essential for this enzymatic activity.

discussion
in an effort to discover trypanosome substrates of prmts, we utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that associate with the major type i protein arginine methyltransferase in t. brucei, tbprmt <dig>  <cit> . of particular interest to us are proteins whose functions might be affected by arginine methylation. here, we report that tbprmt <dig> directly interacts in both far western and co-immunoprecipitation assays with a novel protein. we termed this protein tblpn, based on the presence of two conserved  domains found in a family of proteins called lipins. we further demonstrate that, like tbprmt <dig>  tblpn is cytoplasmic in pf t. brucei, consistent with a function in tblpn methylation. together, these data point to tblpn as a candidate protein whose post-transcriptional gene regulatory functions are affected by arginine methylation.

we demonstrated that, as predicted from the amino acid sequence, recombinant tblpn, as other members of the lipin family, exhibits phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzymatic activity. mutation of the conserved aspartic acid residues  to alanines results in a significant reduction in the enzymatic activity of tblpn. these two aspartic acid residues are part of the conserved dxdxt motif found in lipin proteins and other members of the haloacid dehalogenase -like superfamily  <cit> . based on the crystal structure of l-2-haloacid dehalogenase from pseudomonas, it is likely that asp- <dig> in tblpn acts as a nucleophile in the phosphoryl transfer reaction.

compared to the recombinant yeast pah <dig>  and human lipin- <dig> , his ~ tblpn displays a lower but still significant specific activity  <cit> . one possible explanation for this lower specific activity is the fact that the recombinant protein may not contain the same post-translational modifications as those found in the native protein. it is of interest that several lipin homologues are highly modified at the post translational level. in rat and in mouse adipocytes, lipin  <dig> contains at least  <dig> and as many as  <dig> sites that are phosphorylated in response to insulin  <cit> . although it does not affect its intrinsic phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity, phosphorylation of lipin- <dig> decreases the association with intracellular membranes, thus the active lipin fraction  <cit> . in addition, the lipin homologue smp <dig> is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc28/cdk <dig> in budding yeast  <cit> . the authors have shown that phosphorylation of smp <dig> by cdc28/cdk <dig> enhances its association with promoters of lipid biosynthetic genes, which leads to their transcriptional down-regulation. careful analysis of tblpn amino acid sequence revealed the presence of  <dig> conserved amino acid residues shown to be phosphorylated in either mouse  lipin- <dig> or yeast  smp <dig>  these residues are ser- <dig> , thr- <dig> , thr- <dig> , ser- <dig> , and ser- <dig> . in addition, a previous analysis of the cytosolic phosphoproteome of bf t. brucei identified tblpn as containing two phosphorylated residues   <cit> . whether additional or different amino acids are phosphorylated in the pf is still unclear.

phosphorylation of tblpn may also impact its association with other proteins, as it has been demonstrated for at least one other member of the lipin family. in adipocytes, lipin- <dig> interacts directly with 14-3- <dig> proteins  <cit> . 14-3-3- proteins are known to regulate the subcellular localization of a wide variety of proteins through interaction with phosphoserine residues. in adipocytes, lipin- <dig> is mostly localized to the cytosol and translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where it catalyzes dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid. stimulation of adipocytes by insulin promotes phosphorylation of lipin- <dig> and enhances binding by 14-3- <dig> proteins. this results in cytoplasmic retention of lipin- <dig> 

additionally, we showed that tblpn is methylated on arginine residues in vivo. to our knowledge, this is the first instance of any lipin or phosphatidic acid phosphatase being methylated. the demonstration that tblpn is methylated in vivo suggests that methylation could directly modulate tblpn enzymatic activity or protein-protein interactions, or both. arginine methylation has been shown to generally alter protein function by modulating protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and protein trafficking  <cit> . arginine residues that serve as substrates for prmts are usually found within glycine/arginine rich  domains  <cit> . based on this, arginine residues throughout tblpn, including both the n-lip and c-lip domains are predicted to undergo methylation. thus, it will be of great future interest to determine whether tbprmt <dig> and/or other tbprmts are responsible for tblpn methylation in vivo, and to determine whether tblpn methylation has any effect on its ability to interact with other proteins and whether it modulates its enzymatic activity.

in yeast and mammals, lipin proteins enable the cell to generate diacylglycerol  by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid. in addition to serving as a precursor for triacylglycerol , dag is also used to synthesize phosphatidylcholine  and phosphatidylethanolamine   <cit> . in mammalian and yeast cells, the bulk of the pc pool is synthesized by the cdp-choline branch of the kennedy pathway  <cit> . in addition, a small fraction of pc is generated by sequential methylation of pe  <cit> . in eukaryotes, pe can be synthesized by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine , by head group exchange with ps, by acylation of lyso-pe, or by the cdp-ethanolamine branch of the kennedy pathway  <cit> . as for other eukaryotes, pc and pe constitute the majority of phospholipids in trypanosomes  <cit> . of great importance is the fact that, as opposed to other parasitic organisms, trypanosomes synthesize phospholipids de novo <cit> . although the pathways for phospholipids biosynthesis have not been very well characterized, recent data have helped to better understand how trypanosomes are able to assemble phospholipids. in t. brucei, pc is synthesized solely by the cdp-choline branch of the kennedy pathway, while pe is produced exclusively via the cdp-ethanolamine branch of the kennedy pathway  <cit> . disruption of the enzymes of the cdp-ethanolamine pathway by rna interference have shown that this branch of the kennedy pathway is essential for both procyclic and bloodstream form t. brucei cell growth  <cit> .

pe and phosphatidylinositol  are key phospholipids involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol . in trypanosomes, a large number of surface proteins with critical role in virulence surface proteins are anchored to the plasma membrane via gpi molecules. one of these proteins is the variant surface glycoprotein , a major virulence factor that undergoes antigenic variation and enables the parasite to evade the immune system of its mammalian host  <cit> . the steps involved in the biosynthesis of gpi, a process essential for t. brucei bloodstream form survival, have been well studied. this synthesis differs in certain aspects from the pathway in mammalian cells and yeast. in t. brucei, the pool of pi used for gpi synthesis is supplied from glucose-6-phosphate by the action of pi synthase, an enzyme shown to be essential in both bloodstream and procyclic form trypanosomes  <cit> . a crucial step in the gpi synthesis pathway is the transfer of phosphoethanolamine  to mannose residues on the growing gpi. in this reaction, the ethanolamine moiety is provided by pe  <cit> . as described earlier, synthesis of pe in t. brucei is carried out via the cdp-ethanolamine branch of the kennedy pathway using dag as the initial substrate. it has been demonstrated that inhibition of pe synthesis prevents de novo gpi biosynthesis  <cit> . as we demonstrated in the current paper that tblpn catalyzes the dephosphorylation of pa into dag, it is attractive to speculate that tblpn plays an important role in gpi biosynthesis, and thus in the expression of this major virulence factor.

CONCLUSIONS
the results clearly identify tblpn as a new member of the lipin family of proteins. the presence of the conserved n-lip and c-lip domains, and especially the ability of recombinant tblpn to dephosphorylate phosphatidic acid indicate that this enzyme is likely to be involved in phospholipid biosynthesis in trypanosomes. finally, the observation that, in vivo, tblpn contains methylated arginine residues is very significant, as it is the only lipin or phosphatidic acid phosphatase to date to exhibit such a post-translational modification.
