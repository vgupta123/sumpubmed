BACKGROUND
during retinal development, proliferation and differentiation must be tightly coordinated in order to produce a tissue of the proper size and containing the correct cell types  <cit> . the hh pathway has been shown to play a critical role in controlling these two seemingly opposite processes  <cit> . early in retinal development, the optic vesicle is composed of a population of proliferating neuroepithelial cells that will ultimately give rise to the mature retina  <cit> . differentiation of the retinal neuroepithelium occurs in a succession of temporally overlapping waves  <cit> . in the zebrafish, the first cells to exit the cell cycle become retinal ganglion cells , which differentiate in a sonic hh -dependent wave  <cit> . a second hh-dependent wave of differentiation in the inner nuclear layer  occurs almost simultaneously with the first wave, and is responsible for the differentiation of the multiple cell types of the inl  and the rod and cone photoreceptors of the outer nuclear layer   <cit> . in addition, extra-retinal hh signaling originating in the retinal pigment epithelium  has been suggested to direct photoreceptor differentiation  <cit> . while the role of the hh pathway in cell cycle exit and differentiation of retinal progenitors is well described, comparatively less is known about its possible influence on cell fate decisions. in xenopus, over-expression of p27xic <dig>  which promotes cell cycle exit, results in increased numbers of early-born cell types , while the over-expression of cyclin e <dig>  which inhibits cell cycle exit, biases cell fate towards late-born cell types   <cit> . similarly, shh has been shown to promote early cell cycle exit in the xenopus retina  <cit> ; however, a direct role of the hh pathway in dictating retinal cell fate has yet to be established in vivo.

while the cells of the central retina of the zebrafish exit the cell cycle by  <dig> hours post fertilization   <cit> , a population of retinal progenitors at the cmz is maintained and continues to proliferate throughout the animal's lifetime  <cit> . the spatial pattern of cells within the cmz, with retinal stem cells at the most peripheral region followed by proliferative retinal progenitors and finally differentiating progenitors more centrally, is thought to recapitulate the temporal sequence of early retinal development  <cit> . some of the factors that control early retinal development, such as notch, rx <dig>  pax6a, and vsx2/chx <dig>  are expressed in the zebrafish cmz  <cit> . in xenopus, expression of gli <dig>  gli <dig>  and smoothened, is found at the retinal margin, suggesting a role for the hh pathway in the stem cell/progenitor population in the cmz  <cit> . shh over-expression studies in chick support a role for the hh pathway as a mitogen in the cmz  <cit> , consistent with its described mitogenic effects on retinal progenitors in early zebrafish and mouse retinal development  <cit> .

invaluable knowledge regarding hh function in the developing retina has been gained from the analysis of hh pathway mutants in zebrafish. for example, the zebrafish mutants syu  and smu  have helped elucidate the complex mechanisms of hh-dependent neural differentiation and proliferation  <cit> . however, retinal differentiation is severely defective or altogether absent in these mutants due to defective hh signaling, making it difficult to arrive at definitive conclusions about the possible role of the hh pathway in cell fate decisions. to address this issue, we analyzed retinal development in the zebrafish lep/ptc <dig> mutant, in which the hh pathway is 'over-active'. lep/ptc <dig> mutants possess a non-sense mutation in the exon encoding the sixth trans-membrane domain of patched <dig>  <cit> , which is predicted to abolish its function  <cit> . loss of patched function results in an 'over-active' hh pathway due de-repression of smoothened  <cit> . normally, in the absence of hh ligand, the patched protein inhibits the activity of smoothened. binding of the hh ligand to its patched receptor relieves this inhibition, ultimately resulting in increased transcription of hh target genes  <cit> . a non-functional patched would therefore result in loss of inhibition on, and constitutive activity of, smoothened in ptc <dig> deficient cells. lep/ptc <dig> mutants possess increased proliferation in multiple tissues including the retinal cmz  <cit> . utilizing this mutant as a tool, we sought to gain further insight into hh function with respect to retinal cell fate decisions and to determine how hh activity influences progenitor proliferation at the cmz. our results revealed no significant change in neuronal composition within the retina, but we did note a reduction in differentiated müller glia that was accompanied by localized müller glial reactivity and abnormalities at the vitreo-retinal interface. in addition, the results of cell cycle analyses suggest that the over-proliferation at the cmz likely results from an expansion of the progenitor cell population, and not from direct effects of the mutation on cell cycle kinetics within progenitor cells.

RESULTS
lep/ptc <dig> mutants possess enlarged retinas and overgrown irises, while lens and rpe morphology are largely normal
lep/ptc <dig> mutants were isolated based on expanded pcna staining in multiple tissues including the retinal cmz  <cit> . while mutant embryos appear to be of normal size at  <dig> days post fertilization  , their retinas are enlarged  and they possess reduced pupil size . to characterize ocular tissues in lep/ptc <dig> mutants, we performed histological analyses at  <dig> hpf, around the time of the onset of retinal differentiation, and at 5dpf, when the laminar organization of the embryonic retina is complete  <cit> . lep/ptc <dig> retinas appear largely normal at 33dpf and do not possess increases in retinal cell number relative to phenotypically wild-type siblings . at 5dpf, however, lep/ptc <dig> retinal cells are more tightly packed and mutant retinas contain a larger number of cells as compared to their phenotypically wild-type siblings . normal retinal lamination of differentiated neurons has been shown to be dependent on shh signaling in vitro  <cit> . lamination is largely normal in lep/ptc <dig> mutants and all major cell types are present . loss-of-function experiments in both frog and mouse have suggested a role for the hh pathway in the development of the rpe  <cit> . in lep/ptc <dig> mutants the rpe is of normal thickness and morphology. the hh pathway has also been implicated in lens development  <cit> , and the reduced pupil size present in lep/ptc <dig> mutants was previously attributed to potential degeneration of the lens  <cit> . no gross morphological defects are evident in the lenses of lep/ptc <dig> mutants at either 33hpf or 5dpf, however. additionally, histological analyses revealed an abnormality in the anterior segment of lep/ptc <dig> eyes where the iris was over-grown and extended further over the lens than in sibling retinas . the enlarged iris and the overgrowth of the cmz are the likely causes of the decreased pupil size, rather than defects in lens morphology.

neuronal composition of the lep/ptc <dig> retina is normal, while müller glia are under-represented
hh signaling has been shown to be required for the differentiation of multiple cell types in the vertebrate retina  <cit>  and is thought to promote cell fate decisions by modulating the timing of cell cycle exit  <cit> . shh gain-of-function experiments in xenopus link a faster cell cycle with early cell cycle exit  <cit> , which in turn results in an over-production of early-born retinal cell types at the expense of late-born cell types  <cit> . we therefore reasoned that in lep/ptc <dig> retinas, where the hh pathway is over-active, early-born cell types would be over-represented while late-born cell types would be reduced in number. cell counts from histological sections of lep/ptc <dig> mutants revealed a statistically significant increase in cell number in all three retinal nuclear layers , as well as in total retinal cells, when compared to those from phenotypically wild-type siblings . however, no significant change in the proportion of each layer was observed when the number of cells per layer was calculated as a percentage of total retinal cells . this suggests that all three retinal cell layers are proportionally increased in lep/ptc <dig> retinas.

it is possible that in lep/ptc <dig> mutants, an overactive hh pathway could alter neuronal composition within each layer. to test this hypothesis, immunohistochemistry using markers for each specific cell type in the inl and onl was performed on retinal sections at 5dpf, when all cell types are normally differentiated and the embryonic retina is fully developed. since the gcl layer is almost exclusively composed of retinal ganglion cells , no further analysis was performed on this layer. in order to analyze cell types within the inl, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies that mark amacrine cells , bipolar cells  and müller glia , while horizontal cells were detected according to their stereotypical morphology in histological sections. this analysis revealed that while the proportion of each neuronal cell type in the inl was not significantly changed in lep/ptc <dig> mutants, there was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of differentiated müller glia . for the onl, immunohistochemistry was performed to detect rods  and each three cone opsins   <cit> . due to the diffuse nature of the staining of some of the markers used, precise cell counts were not performed on these cell types. however, immunohistochemisty did show that these cell types are present in lep/ptc <dig> and qualitatively appear unaffected . in all, lep/ptc <dig> mutants possess more cells in their retinas and each cell type, except for müller glia, was present at identical ratios to those observed in phenotypically wild-type siblings.

lep/ptc <dig> mutants possess abnormalities at the vitreo-retinal boundary and localized müller glial reactivity
müller glial endfeet terminate at, and contribute to, the inner limiting membrane , which separates the retina from the vitreous  <cit> . interestingly, our immunohistochemical analysis of differentiated müller glia revealed disruptions in the integrity of the ilm . since humans who possess mutations in the ptch gene  have been previously shown to possess abnormalities in the vitreo-retinal interface  <cit> , we sought to further investigate this phenotype. high magnification examination of gs-stained retinas revealed disruptions in the integrity of the ilm in 40% of the lep/ptc <dig> retinas examined. while müller glial endfeet form a tight and continuous boundary at the vitreo-retinal boundary in sibling retinas, the ilm in lep/ptc <dig> retinas was often discontinuous and disorganized, and endfeet did not appear to properly terminate in the ilm . in ptc1+/- mice, ocular abnormalities are accompanied by the upregulation of gfap, a marker of reactive müller glia, and ectopic proliferation of müller glia in the central retina  <cit> .

immunohistochemical analysis of gfap revealed that its levels in müller glia were indeed higher in lep/ptc <dig> mutant retinas as compared to their phenotypically wild-type siblings . higher levels of gfap were often localized to müller glial endfeet in the central retina, adjacent to the optic nerve. however, brdu incorporation assays in lep/ptc <dig> mutants at 5dpf did not reveal ectopic proliferation in the central retina , suggesting that the upregulation of gfap is not coupled with müller glial proliferation in this context. in addition, the localized nature of müller glial reactivity in not due to abnormal cell death in the lep/ptc <dig> retina and/or optic nerve since no apoptotic nuclei were detected by tunel assays .

patched <dig>  is expressed in the progenitor/stem cell populations of the cmz
we next sought to better understand the nature of the over-proliferation at the cmz by defining the retinal cell populations that express the ptc <dig> transcript. at 56hpf, prior to the time that the overgrowth phenotype becomes detectable, ptc <dig> expression was visible at the retinal margin, corresponding to the undifferentiated population of retinal progenitors of the cmz . expression continued to be restricted to the cmz at 72hpf , consistent with previously reported expression of hh target genes in the xenopus cmz  <cit> . closer inspection of ptc <dig> expression in the cmz at 72hpf revealed that low-level ptc <dig> expression was detected throughout most of the cmz, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . staining was more robust in two distinct cmz cell populations; the first was immediately apposed to the rpe and the second was a patch of cells at the edge of the cmz, bordering the differentiated gcl . hh ligands have been shown to be expressed in both the rpe  <cit>  and the gcl  <cit>  during retinal development, and patched genes are expressed in a hh-dependent manner  <cit> . thus, these cmz regions may reflect areas of active hh signaling. finally, the ptc <dig> transcript is expressed at the iridio-corneal angle, where the iris and cornea converge  <cit>  .

the number of proliferating progenitors, but not the rate of progenitor proliferation, is increased in the lep/ptc <dig> cmz
ptc1+/- mice possess increased numbers of progenitor cells at all stages of retinal development, suggesting a role for the hh pathway in controlling the size of retinal progenitor populations in the ciliary margin, and these mice also possess a persistent progenitor population in the retinal margin as adults  <cit> . studies in post-hatch chicks suggest that shh regulates the proliferation of cmz progenitors  <cit> . in addition, shh over-expression studies in xenopus have revealed a role for the hh pathway in regulating the length of the cell cycle in the progenitor populations of the cmz  <cit> . given the differing roles for hh pathway activity in these contexts, we wanted to determine whether the over-proliferation in lep/ptc <dig> retinas was due to an increase in the number of proliferating cells and/or an increase in the proliferation rate of the progenitor cell population in the cmz. to address these possibilities, we first performed a 'pulse-chase' brdu analysis on lep/ptc <dig> and sibling embryos starting at 64hpf, when a mild retinal phenotype is first detectable. embryos were sorted according to phenotype and exposed to a short pulse  of brdu. half of the embryos were immediately fixed for sectioning, while the other half were transferred to non-brdu containing fish water and fixed  <dig> hours later . this enabled us to determine the rate of progenitor proliferation in both lep/ptc <dig> and sibling retinas during the  <dig> hour chase period. the results of these assays revealed that, on average, lep/ptc <dig> retinal sections contained 67% more brdu-positive cells in the cmzs when compared to phenotypically wild-type sibling retinas at 64hpf . at 72hpf, after the  <dig> hour 'chase', the average number of brdu-positive cells in lep/ptc <dig> and phenotypically wild-type sibling retinal sections increased by almost identical ratios . from these data, we can therefore infer that, on average, each proliferating cell gave rise to  <dig>  daughter cells during the  <dig> hour 'chase' period. to further analyze proliferation, we assayed the expression of phosphohistone h <dig>  and these analyses revealed that the proportion of cmz progenitors occupying the m phase of the cell cycle increased by approximately 34% in lep/ptc <dig> retinas at 64hpf, when compared to their phenotypically wild-type siblings . the degree of this increase was almost identical to that observed in progenitor cells occupying the s phase using brdu as a marker , suggesting that the length of the s and m phases was not changed relative to the other. these results support a model in which the expanded cmz of lep/ptc <dig> mutants arises from an expansion of the progenitor cell population therein, and not from changes in the length of the cell cycle in these progenitor cells.

discussion
retinal patterning is normal in lep/ptc <dig> mutants
characterization of lep/ptc <dig> retinas with respect to cell type composition revealed that over-activity of the hh pathway did not affect retinal patterning. cell count analysis of all major retinal neuronal cell types revealed no change in the proportion of each cell type. this finding was surprising in light of the well established role of the hh pathway in patterning and cell fate decisions throughout the cns in a number of model systems  <cit> , as well as studies in xenopus which show that the over-expression of shh results in early cell cycle exit  <cit> , and that can, in turn, influence cell fate decisions  <cit> . while mouse ptc1+/-  mutants were found to possess no defects in retinal cell fate specification, ptc1-/- mice could not be examined since they die in utero  <cit> . our results indicate that ptc2-dependent hh signaling does not likely play an integral role in neuronal cell fate decisions in the zebrafish retina. these findings raise the possibility that the second zebrafish patched protein  might compensate for the lack of a functional patched <dig>  while patched <dig>  mutant retinas contain all major retinal cell types, the lack of a retinal phenotype might be due to the hypomorphic nature of the mutation  <cit> . however, this seems unlikely since patched <dig> transcripts are not expressed at detectable levels in retinal tissue throughout development . the reduced number of differentiated müller glia, a late born cell type  <cit> , could feasibly be due to a bias towards early born cell types in lep/ptc <dig> mutants; however, this potential bias does not affect neuronal composition of the retina at 5dpf. it is possible that a transient bias towards early neuronal cell types could occur early in retinal development, but any differences could masked by neurons added from the cmz later in development. conversely, any bias could also be present in neuronal populations that arise at the cmz, resulting in an unnoticeable change in neuronal composition of the 5dpf lep/ptc <dig> retina. with this in mind, it will be interesting to examine the proportion of retinal cell types in juvenile lep/ptc <dig> mutants, as some homozygous fish reach two months of age  <cit> . finally, the hh pathway could play a role in neuronal cell fate decisions in the retina through hh ligand interactions with other hh receptors. the ihog hh receptors have recently been suggested to compete with patched for hh binding  <cit>  and act at levels at, or upstream of, patched  <cit> . indeed, the vertebrate ihog homologue cdo is expressed in the developing mouse retina  <cit> . in the future, it would be interesting to test whether certain aspects of retinal development, such as cell fate decisions, might be ihog-dependent.

lep/ptc <dig> mutants as a possible model for the study of bcns-related ocular pathologies
in bcns patients, abnormalities at the interface between the retina and the vitreous, known as epiretinal membranes , are associated with disruptions of the ilm and are thought to result from the overproliferation and ectopic presence of multiple cell types, including glia  <cit> . bcns ocular pathologies have been linked to mutations in the human ptch gene  <cit> , and have been shown to be associated with reactive müller glia  <cit> . müller glial reactivity is often marked by upregulation of gfap, and lep/ptc <dig> mutants possessed regions of elevated gfap levels. elevated gfap levels were consistently localized in the inner retina, where müller glial endfeet terminate and contribute to the ilm. staining with gs, which labels the müller glial endfeet, revealed disruptions in ilm integrity in ~40% of mutant retinas assayed. in these cases, müller glial endfeet did not terminate properly in the ilm, and the ilm was discontinuous. in some human patients, erms are found adjacent to retinal arteries  <cit> ; interestingly, we consistently detected the presence of reactive glial endfeet in localized retinal regions adjacent to the optic nerve and embryonic retinal vasculature. importantly, no increases in cell death were detected in the retina or optic nerve of lep/ptc <dig> mutants, or in müller glia themselves , ruling out reactivity due to apoptosis. finally, in other contexts, müller glia reactivity is often coupled with ectopic proliferation of these cells during 'reactive gliosis'  <cit> . brdu analysis did not detect ectopic proliferation in the central retinas of lep/ptc <dig> mutants , indicating that while a subset of these cells was reactive, they did not undergo a proliferative response. while reactive müller glia have been shown to be associated with erms, it is unclear whether reactive müller glia are the cause of these pathologies or, conversely, whether müller glia become reactive in response to erm formation. further studies will be required to answer this question and to shed light on the cellular and molecular causes of erm formation.

the retinal progenitor population of the cmz is expanded in lep/ptc <dig> mutants
exact roles for hh pathway activity in proliferating retinal progenitor cells remain unclear. over-expression studies in xenopus suggest a direct role for the hh pathway in regulating proliferation by influencing the length of the cell cycle in cmz progenitors  <cit> . in ptc1+/- mice, more retinal progenitors are allocated to the cmz throughout development and into adulthood  <cit> . brdu pulse-chase analysis of the progenitor population at the lep/ptc <dig> cmz suggests that patched-dependent hh signaling controls the number of retinal progenitors in the zebrafish cmz, and does not directly affect the length of the cell cycle in these cells. importantly, cell counts at an earlier time-point, before the formation of the cmz, revealed no increase in cell number in lep/ptc <dig> retinas as compared to their wild-type siblings , suggesting that the increase in proliferating progenitors at the cmz is not simply due to an earlier proliferative event. shh has been shown to control stem cell maintenance in multiple organs, including the adult brain . indeed, the hh pathway genes smo, gli <dig>  and gli <dig> are expressed in the putative stem cell region of the xenopus cmz  <cit> . in light of our findings, it is possible that the increase in retinal progenitors in the lep/ptc <dig> cmz is an indirect result of mis-regulation of the stem cell population rather than a direct effect on progenitor proliferation.

CONCLUSIONS
the possible role for the hh pathway in retinal cell fate decisions has yet to be established in vivo. our results indicate that patched2-dependent hh signaling is not likely to play an integral role in dictating neuronal cell fate decisions in the zebrafish retina. in addition, ocular phenotypes in lep/ptc <dig> mutants that are similar to those found in human bcns patients point to the utility of the lep/ptc <dig> mutant line as a model for the study of bcns ocular pathologies. with regards to progenitor proliferation, our data support a role for patched2-dependent hh signaling in the control of the size of progenitor populations at the retinal cmz, and not in regulating their rate of proliferation, during zebrafish eye development.
