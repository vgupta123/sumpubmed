BACKGROUND
transcriptional regulatory proteins play a central role in the expression of genomic information during complex biological processes in all organisms. among these proteins, transcriptional co-activators are key components of eukaryotic gene expression by interacting with both transcription factors and/or other regulatory elements and the basal transcription machinery  <cit> . multiprotein bridging factor  <dig> , a transcriptional co-activator, enhances transcription of its target genes by bridging the general factor tbp  and specific transcription factors bound to their target promoters in eukaryotes such as yeast  <cit> , drosophila <cit>  and arabidopsis <cit> .

mbf1-type genes  encode functional transcriptional co-activators as demonstrated by their capacity to complement the yeast mbf <dig> mutant  <cit> . fusion of tomato sler <dig> to ear  in the microtom cultivar induced a delay of seed germination, but had no obvious effect on plant growth  <cit> . moreover, it was reported that the stmbf <dig> gene in potato was induced by pathogen attack, oxidative stress, wounding and in response to salicylic acid  treatment  <cit> . direct evidence of the involvement of mbf <dig> in plant responses to environmental stresses was obtained by enhancing tolerance to heat and osmotic stresses in transgenic arabidopsis lines expressing the atmbf1c gene and more recently atmbf1a, without growth retardation  <cit> . these data indicate that mbf1-like genes can be associated with a variety of developmental processes in plants such as environmental stress tolerance. to date, there are very few data on the significance of mbf <dig> in cold stress tolerance.

pepper  is a member of the solanaceae family, and an important vegetable and spice crop valued for its aroma, taste, pungency and flavor. the pepper fruit is the second most consumed vegetable around the world  <cit> . different types of peppers, including chili, mild and sweet peppers are cultivated worldwide. low temperature is one of the most important abiotic factors limiting the growth, development and geographical distribution of plants  <cit> . pepper plants originate from tropical regions and are very sensitive to low temperature, which affects their vegetative development and reproduction, resulting in economic losses  <cit> . as part of production and fruit quality improvement, we are interested in investigating plant defense mechanisms to improve resistance to environmental stresses. in our previous report, we showed that exogenous application of aba increased the tolerance of pepper seedlings to chilling-induced oxidative damage, mainly by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and expression of related genes  <cit> . furthermore, aba-mediated candidate genes associated with chilling stress have been fully characterized in pepper plants using a suppression subtractive hybridization  method  <cit> . one of the genes cloned from the reverse subtraction was homologous to solanum tuberosum mbf <dig>  encoding the coactivator multiprotein bridging factor  <dig>  expression of this mbf <dig> homologue was highly induced by cold stress, whereas aba-pretreatment decreased its expression in pepper seedlings subjected to cold stress. however, the function of this gene involved in the defense response to chilling stress remains to be elucidated.

in this study, based on the above-mentioned expressed sequence tag  from the reverse ssh library that enriched the up-regulated expressed genes responding to chilling stress, we have functionally characterized the homolog of stmbf <dig> in pepper . the results of this study suggest that cambf <dig> transcript in pepper seedlings can be suppressed by sa, salt, osmotic and heavy metal stresses. overexpression of cambf <dig> in arabidopsis displayed reduced tolerance to cold and high salt stress.

RESULTS
isolation of the cambf <dig> cdna clone and sequence analysis
a differential screening of a cold-related pepper seedling cdna library, using pcr-amplified subtracted and control probes, was performed previously  <cit> . one of the isolated clones exhibited 80% identity at the nucleotide level to stmbf <dig> from solanum tuberosum <cit> . a full-length clone of this homologue was obtained by a homology-based candidate gene method, including the complete open reading frame. the gene was named cambf <dig> and submitted to genbank with the accession number jx <dig>  the size of the cambf <dig> clone was 648 bp, comprising an open reading frame of 420 bp . the predicted polypeptide was basic, with a pi of  <dig>  and a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. an alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of cambf <dig> with other homologous sequences is presented in figure  <dig>  at the amino acid level, cambf <dig> showed a high degree of conservation with known genes of other plant species: solanum tuberosum   <cit> , and arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> .

expression of cambf <dig> in pepper seedlings is severely suppressed by stress and sa treatments
a number of mbf <dig> genes were found to be differentially induced by abiotic stress  <cit> . therefore, we suspected that the cambf <dig> gene may be involved in stress signaling pathways and were interested in its possible function in stress responses. as a first step toward functional analysis, we examined the expression pattern of cambf <dig> in pepper plants using qrt-pcr analysis. this analysis revealed that the cambf <dig> gene was expressed ubiquitously in all developmental stages of plants and in all tested organs, including root, stem, leaf, flower, fruit and seed . high-level expression was detected in flower and seed, although expression level in root was rather low. as shown in figure  <dig>  cambf <dig> expression was dramatically decreased by several stress conditions, including 5 mm sa, high salt , osmotic stress , and heavy metal . rapid and robust down-regulation of cambf <dig> transcript was observed at 1 h after salt, osmotic and heavy metal treatments, which decreased to  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively. in contrast, a slight reduction of cambf <dig> transcript was found during 12 h of sa treatment and followed by an increase to the initial level .

reduced tolerance of cambf1-overexpressing arabidopsis plants to cold stress
to test the function of cambf <dig> in arabidopsis, we generated transgenic plants that constitutively expressed cambf <dig> under the control of the camv 35s promoter. transgenic plants expressing cambf <dig> appeared similar in their growth and development to wt plants. however, as shown in figure  <dig>  the transgenic plants were larger than the wt plants during the florescence production period; the rosette leaves of transgenic plants were 70% longer and 60% wider than those of wt plants.

to study the response of cambf1-expressing plants to abiotic stress, 2-week-old wt and transgenic seedlings were subjected to several stresses, including cold, salinity, and aba. firstly, transcript levels of the high homology  modulated by the overexpression of cambf <dig> under normal conditions were determined by qrt-pcr. compared to wt plants, the expression of the homologous genes was not basically altered in transgenic plants when grown in normal condition , indicating that overexpression of pepper cambf <dig> gene has no obvious effect on atmbf1s transcripts in arabidopsis. the cambf <dig> gene was not detected in wt plants. cambf <dig> transcript in transgenic plants subjected to cold stress, salinity, and aba was much lower than that detected in transgenic plants under normal conditions , suggesting that expression of cambf <dig> in arabidopsis was dramatically decreased by stress treatments such as cold, salinity, and aba. furthermore, the visible symptoms of leaf damage in transgenic seedlings were observed to examine the tolerance of cambf1-expressing plants to cold stress. as shown in figure  <dig>  overexpression of the pepper cambf <dig> gene in arabidopsis aggravated the visible symptoms of leaf damage caused by cold stress in seedlings. wilting appeared after 6 h of cold stress in transgenic plants and became serious at 24 h, while control leaves only exhibited withering after 48 h of cold stress. meanwhile, to evaluate the extent of cell damage caused by cold stress in cambf1-expressing seedlings, electrolyte leakage was measured. the transgenic plants presented  <dig>  folds higher electrolyte leakage than wt, which suggests that the membrane is likely to be impaired in these seedlings subjected to cold stress . these results suggested that overexpression of cambf <dig> in arabidopsis could downregulate the expression of genes involved in stress tolerance.

we selected a group of candidate genes and conducted qrt-pcr analysis to test this hypothesis . earlier studies have found rd29a, rd <dig>  rab <dig>  kin <dig> and erd <dig> to be involved in the response to dehydration and cold/aba  <cit> . compared with normal conditions, cold stress induced rd29a, erd <dig> and kin <dig> genes expression in both transgenic and wt plants . after cold treatment, the expression of rd29a, erd <dig>  and kin <dig> in the transgenic plants was lower than that in the wt plants. meanwhile, rab <dig> and rd <dig> transcripts were dramatically decreased in both transgenic and control plants subjected to cold stress . the expression of the rd <dig> gene was basically not detected in transgenic plants under cold stress; the decrease in rab <dig> expression in transgenic plants was similar to that in wt plants during 24 h of cold stress. overall, after cold treatment overexpression of the cambf <dig> gene in arabidopsis suppressed chilling-induced rd29a, erd <dig> and kin <dig> transcripts and aggravated chilling-decreased rd <dig> expression. therefore, cambf <dig> appeared to act as a negative regulator of stress-responsive gene expression such as rd29a, erd <dig> kin <dig> and rd <dig>  consistent with the results from leaf chilling injury assays and electrolyte leakage measurement.

the cambf1-overexpressing arabidopsis is hypersensitive to salt stress
to further characterize the tolerance of cambf1-overexpressing plants to salinity, transgenic seeds were germinated in ms/ <dig> media supplemented with 100 mm nacl and allowed to grow for 8 days. transgenic seeds exhibited hypersensitivity to salinity compared with wt seeds . on medium containing 100 mm nacl, 78% of wt seeds germinated within  <dig> d, whereas the germination percentage for transgenic seeds was only 12% during the same period. in addition, the germination and subsequent growth of transgenic seedlings were comparable to wt plants on normal medium, but were significantly more inhibited by salt stress . the cotyledons of 6-day-old transgenic lines were bleached 7 days after transfer to medium containing 150 mm nacl and became serious at 9 days, whereas the cotyledons of wt plants were slightly affected . on the other hand, the primary root growth of transgenic plants was similar to that of wt plants under salt stress. however, lateral root formation was more severely influenced by salinity in transgenic plants compared with wt plants .

similarly, comparative expression analyses of the stress gene markers described above were also performed by qrt-pcr on rna isolated from 2-week-old plants grown under non-stress and salt stress conditions . upon salinity treatment, several gene markers  were highly induced in both wt and transgenic seedlings . conversely, rd <dig> and erd <dig> transcripts were dramatically decreased in both transgenic and wt plants subjected to salt stress . furthermore, the expression of rd29a, rab <dig>  kin <dig> and erd <dig> in the transgenic lines was higher than that in the wt plants under high salt conditions. therefore, overexpression of cambf <dig> in arabidopsis appeared to positively regulate the expression of stress-responsive gene markers such as rd29a, rab <dig>  kin <dig> and erd <dig>  which was not consistent with the results from seed germination and cotyledon greening assays. in some cases, the level of stress gene expression appears to be insufficient to induce tolerance changes  <cit> .

altered expression of stress-responsive hsps in the cambf1-overexpressing arabidopsis
to evaluate whether cambf <dig> expression could be correlated with alterations of other stress-responsive genes, classical heat-shock genes, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> were tested in all lines by qrt-pcr . compared with control plants, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> transcripts  were decreased in transgenic plants under normal conditions. after cold treatment, the expression of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> in the transgenic plants was lower than that in the wt plants ; whereas, the expression of these genes in the transgenic lines was higher than that in the wt plants under high salt conditions , indicating that comparative regulation of hsps in response to cambf <dig> overexpression could be related to different stresses.

discussion
here, we report a putative transcription coactivator from pepper seedlings, the putative amino acid sequence of which was 95% and 80% identical to those of stmbf <dig> and atmbf1b, respectively. therefore, cambf <dig> could be categorized as belonging to the same group as stmbf <dig> <cit> . the deduced amino acid sequences of plant mbf1s revealed the existence of highly conserved amino acid residues in each group  <cit> . additionally, tissue-specific expression of cambf <dig> observed here  suggests that cambf <dig> may be involved in physiological processes of pepper plants. in this regard, the highly homologous stmbf <dig> also exhibits a ubiquitous tissue distribution  <cit> .

in the present study, cambf <dig> transcript in pepper or arabidopsis seedlings was dramatically decreased in response to abiotic stresses such as sa, aba, high salt, osmotic, and heavy metal stress . particularly, under cold stress the expression of cambf <dig> was downregulated in arabidopsis seedlings . these results indicated that cambf <dig> may be negatively involved in stress signaling pathways. unlike other mbf <dig> genes, the expression of atmbf1c is induced by various stresses, including salinity, drought, heat, h2o <dig> and aba, and is not affected by cold stress  <cit> . salinity also induced atmbf1a/b expression  <cit>  and cold stress did not significantly change mrna accumulation of atmbf1a and atmbf1b in arabidopsis <cit> .

cambf1-overexpressing plants showed extremely large leaf phenotypes . this finding could be explained by similar evidence reported by tojo et al. <cit>  who suggested that atmbf1s play a crucial role in controlling rapid leaf expansion through promotion of cell expansion. the amino acid sequences of mbf1s are widely conserved among plant species. similarly, transgenic arabidopsis expressing atmbf1c were 20% larger than control plants and produced more seeds  <cit> .

the visible symptoms of leaf damage in cambf1-expressing transgenic arabidopsis were observed more severely than that in wt plants  and the transgenic plants presented  <dig>  folds higher electrolyte leakage than wt under cold stress , suggesting that the tolerance of transgenic plants to cold stress was reduced. this result was in agreement with the fact that some genes isolated from the reverse ssh library, including a mbf <dig> homologue, were related to reduction in cold tolerance of plants  <cit> . moreover, overexpression of the cambf <dig> gene in arabidopsis reduced the expression of rd29a, erd <dig>  kin <dig>  and rd <dig> during cold treatment . cambf <dig> may reduce the tolerance of arabidopsis to cold stress by negatively regulating stress-tolerant gene expression. suzuki et al. <cit>  reported that the tolerance of mbf1c-expressing transgenic seedlings to cold stress was similar to that of wt seedlings. on the other hand, cambf1-expressing transgenic plants showed high susceptibility to salt stress imposed during seed germination . in contrast to this result, the triple knock-down mutant  presented a significant diminution of germination under osmotic stress  <cit>  and mbf <dig> genes negatively regulated aba-dependent inhibition of germination  <cit> . the cotyledons and lateral root formation were more severely influenced by salinity in transgenic plants compared with wt plants . meanwhile, root growth of mbf1a/c-expressing plants adopted to the high or low-salt condition comparatively better than wt plants  <cit> . seed germination is controlled by the antagonistic action of gibberellic acid  or ethylene and aba  <cit> . mbf <dig> may be involved in several hormone signal transduction pathways  during seed germination  <cit> . in addition, the expression of rd29a, rab <dig>  kin <dig> and erd <dig> in cambf1-expressing transgenic arabidopsis was higher than that in wt plants under high salt conditions . kim et al. <cit>  also reported that mbf1a-overexpressing transgenic arabidopsis induced rd29a, erd <dig>  and kin <dig> during the course of salt treatment. the accumulation of a number of defense transcripts was similarly augmented in mbf1c transgenic arabidopsis in response to heat stress  <cit> .

the expression patterns of the above-mentioned stress gene markers in transgenic plants subjected to cold stress were different from those in transgenic lines under salt stress. this difference could be related to that each stress opens out specific defense mechanisms in young seedlings and the participation of cambf <dig> might be different depending on the stress condition imposed. since different stresses may disrupt plant growth and development in specific ways, the plant might alleviate damage by different mechanisms. the results of this study, that overexpression of the pepper cambf <dig> gene differently modules the expression of hsps in arabidopsis under cold and salt stresses , supported this hypothesis. there were similar reports as follows: constitutive expression of stress-responsive hsp genes was augmented in the abc- mutant, indicating that atmbf1s may act as negative regulators of hsp in arabidopsis thaliana seedlings  <cit> . suzuki et al. <cit>  described that transcripts encoding classical hsps accumulated to a similar level in wt and transgenic plants over-expressing mbf1c; they suggested that the enhanced tolerance of these plants to osmotic and heat-shock stress was associated with the expression of other stress-responsive genes rather than with the constitutive expression of hsps. finally, our data together with previous evidences support that capsicum annum cambf <dig> play a different role as arabidopsis atmbf <dig> in response to salt or cold stress. further studies will be necessary to reveal specific functions for each gene.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that the manipulation of the cambf <dig> gene from pepper using a transgenic approach can lead to reduced cold-stress and salt-stress tolerance in arabidopsis. in addition, overexpression of cambf <dig> may reduce stress tolerance by downregulating stress-responsive genes to aggravate the leaf damage caused by cold stress. however, upregulation of such stress-responsive genes appears to be insufficient to induce tolerance of cambf <dig> transgenic plants to salt stress. the cambf <dig> gene could be a candidate gene for future research on abiotic stress signaling pathways and genetic engineering of novel pepper cultivars. the results of this study will be helpful in providing beneficial information to support biotechnology applications and molecular breeding, which clarify the function of a gene involved in abiotic stress in plants.
