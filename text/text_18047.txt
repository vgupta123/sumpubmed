BACKGROUND
the production and the phenotypic analysis of pairs of nearly isogenic lines  differing only for the allele constitution at given chromosome regions provides the opportunity to test for the presence at such regions of genetic factors involved in the inheritance of a quantitative trait  <cit> . in comparison with quantitative trait locus  analysis carried out based on classical biparental mapping populations such as f <dig>  recombinant inbred lines , etc., this should in principle enhance the statistical power of qtl detection by eliminating the blurring effect of multiple, and possibly interacting, segregating qtls. a collection of nils, each one differing from a reference recipient genotype for a known limited chromosome region, and altogether representing most of a donor genome, is known as introgression library   <cit> . in an il, the donor genome is usually provided by an interfertile accession , while a breeding elite strain is used as the recipient genetic stock. the process of il production invariably involves some backcrossing scheme with the assistance of marker surveys during or after the backcross. ils have been produced for a number of model and crop plant species , and even for model animal species such as mouse  <cit>  and caenorhabditis  <cit> . a pair of fully reciprocal il populations were produced in arabidopsis  <cit> , with the two accessions used once as donor and once as recipient. one il was described in maize involving two inbred lines, tx <dig> and b <dig>  as donor and recipient genotypes, respectively  <cit> .

an il enables moving and testing alleles from wild or landraces accessions into the elite gene pool of a crop, thus making possible their exploitation in plant breeding  <cit> . accordingly, introgression lines belonging to partial or complete il were proven to have breeding potential in cotton  <cit> , maize  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . additionally, il lines played a major role in enabling the positional cloning of major qtls , by providing the starting plant material where the genetic effect of the target qtl could be followed as any other mendelian locus.

here we describe the general features and the initial phenotyping of a maize intraspecific il obtained using gaspé flint as the donor genotype and the elite line b <dig> as the recipient genotype. gaspé flint is a variety belonging to the northern flint maize race group  <cit> , which was cultivated by american native populations in southeastern canada  <cit> . it is virtually the earliest known maize genotype and such earliness is the basis of its adaptation to the very short summer growing season of canada. one of the genetic determinants of gaspé flint extreme earliness, the vegetative to generative transition <dig>  qtl  <cit>  has already been identified by positional cloning and shown to correspond to a non-coding, enhancer-like regulatory element of the ap- <dig> class transcription factor zmrap <dig>   <cit> . the herein described b <dig> × gaspé flint il lays the foundations for the genetic and molecular characterization of additional genetic determinants of flowering time and other traits of agronomic and adaptive importance in maize.

RESULTS
features and coverage of the introgression library
the il was produced following an ssr-based marker-assisted backcross procedure  started from the cross b <dig> × gaspé flint. the genotypic composition of the  <dig> il lines is shown in figure 1a. among these lines,  <dig> showed a single introgression, eight showed one additional introgression on a different chromosome and one showed two additional introgressions. the average introgression length, including lines with multiple introgressions, was  <dig>  cm per lines  and ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm . most of the lines carried homozygous introgressions, although partial heterozygosity was observed at six lines and total heterozygosity at two lines . the majority of the lines carried unique introgressions, with the exception of six pairs of lines , where two lines per region were identified as showing similar introgressions. for each of these pair of lines, the second line was maintained in the il set because derived from a partially different pedigree  within the il backcross, implying that the two lines could carry different crossover events at the target introgression or different hidden introgressions. additional redundancy of gaspé flint introgressions was intentionally maintained at bin  <dig> - <dig> , bin  <dig> - <dig>  and bin  <dig> - <dig> , which are sites of major flowering time qtls , in order to provide enhanced opportunities for further genetic investigations. additional details about il composition are reported in table  <dig> 

a based on the 'genetic 2008' maize reference map length of  <dig>  cm http://www.maizegdb.org/map.php.

b ' in frame' introgressions include one introgression fragment per line only. additionally, redundant introgressions are excluded.

among the  <dig> informative ssr markers,  <dig> showed a polymorphism between b <dig> and gaspé flint. although monomorphic and polymorphic ssrs alternated along the chromosomes, regions with contiguous monomorphic ssrs were observed. such regions hampered the recovery of the corresponding gaspé flint chromosome segments. by arbitrarily considering only segments with four or more contiguous monomorphic ssr, we identified six chromosome regions , for a total of  <dig>  cm, corresponding to  <dig> % of the maize reference linkage map . such chromosome portions were technically non-representable within the library genome, at least with the markers used here. given the low-resolution power of the standard agarose-gel electrophoresis utilized herein, the absence of polymorphism does not necessarily imply identity of nucleotide sequence between gaspé flint and b <dig> at such chromosome regions.

a full markers list is provided in additional file  <dig> 

the non-overlapping fraction of the gaspè flint genome represented in the library corresponded to  <dig>  cm or to  <dig> % of the maize reference map, which rose to  <dig> % if we only consider the genome portion found polymorphic based on ssr profiles. table  <dig> summarizes the il coverage by chromosome.

polymorphic
homozygous
heterozygous
with the only aim to support and verify the qtl analysis results based on the il population, we additionally characterized two small populations, a bc <dig>  and an f <dig>  both derived from b <dig> × gaspé flint crosses .

phenotypic analysis
a computed based on the introgression library field experiment.

the majority of the il lines had dps, gdu, nd, ndbe and ph values close to b <dig> and only mildly skewed distributions toward the gaspé flint values were observed, accordingly with the recovery of most of the b <dig> genome  in all lines . nd, ndae and ndbe values were non-normally distributed . earn and nd resulted non-normally distributed in the bc <dig>  similarly to earn, nd and nd-related traits in the f <dig> 

the bc <dig> population showed a dps frequency distribution shifted to lower values when compared with the f <dig> population . the shift was likely observed because the bc <dig> population was grown later in the summer, in conditions of higher mean temperatures . as a confirmation, the shift disappeared when gdu were considered instead of dps . the anova , evidenced significant variation among il lines  for all traits. broad sense heritability values ranged between  <dig>  for pndbe to  <dig>  for nd . generally, plant  or line  values were within parental values and little or no transgressivity was observed for the three populations with the exceptions of ph and indl . for ph and indl, transgression was observed in the f <dig> and bc <dig> populations, with values higher than the high parent. this type of transgression  for plant height and related phenotypes is not unexpected given the inherent heterozygosity of f <dig> and bc <dig> populations that typically positively influences hybrid vigor. the transgressivity observed in the il population is specifically treated in the qtl section.

correlation among traits
across the three populations, nd was strongly positively correlated with ndbe, ndae, dps and ph. additionally, nd was negatively correlated with indl in the f <dig> and bc <dig> populations, while this correlation was not significant within the il . gdu and dps were highly correlated . ph was correlated  with all traits except earn and pndbe. the genotypic and phenotypic correlation matrices based on the il experiment provided almost identical results .

*, **: significance at p  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

qtls for flowering time
eight nd qtls, on bins  <dig> / <dig>   <dig> / <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig>   <dig> / <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig> were identified. in all cases, the direction of the genetic effect of nd and dps qtls was univocal, as previously noted for the well-characterized flowering time qtls vgt <dig> and vgt <dig>  <cit> , and in other studies  <cit> . this prompted us to name these flowering time loci as qvgt, followed by the bin number of their map location, with the exception of the qtls on bins  <dig>  and  <dig> , for which we kept the former vgt <dig> and vgt <dig> acronyms. summaries of qtl parameters and positions are provided in table  <dig>  additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  and figure  <dig>  a visualization of the phenotypic differences between each il line and b <dig> is provided in figure 1b.

a qtl codes are given for the trait nd only .

b position of the qtls based on the gaspé flint introgressions position and length, as estimated on the reference maize map "genetics 2008" http://www.maizegdb.org/map.php.

c markers or marker-intervals delimiting the gaspé flint introgressions at the qtl chromosome regions.

d qtl genetic effects computed as / <dig>  where ills is the trait mean value of all il lines sharing the same introgression at the qtl region.

the strongest qtl was identified at bin  <dig> - <dig>  in the il, f <dig> and bc <dig> populations, accordingly with the known position of vgt <dig> and vgt <dig>  <cit> . the additive effect  attributed to vgt1-vgt <dig> complex locus in this study was estimated as ail = - <dig>  and af <dig> = - <dig>  nodes . the gaspé allele showed partial dominance. the vgt1-vgt <dig> region showed additional effects on dps, ndbe, ndae, and ph in the il, on ndbe, dps, and ph in the f <dig>  and on dps and ph in the bc <dig> 

the second strongest effect qtl was qvgt- <dig> / <dig> . additional significant effects were recorded for dps, ndbe, ndae, and ph. on the same chromosome, we identified qvgt- <dig>  . the bc <dig> qtl analysis confirmed the presence of flowering time qtl on chr.  <dig>  although the small population size likely precluded the clear separation of lod peaks.

two qtls, qvgt- <dig> / <dig> and qvgt- <dig> / <dig>  were identified on chr.  <dig>  such qtls showed similar genetic effects for nd  and the same effect for dps . the f <dig> lod profiles indicated the presence of small effect qtls for dps at bin  <dig> / <dig> and for ph at bin  <dig> / <dig>  the qtl analysis on bc <dig> identified a dps qtl at an intermediate position between the two previous locations.

one qtl was identified on chr.  <dig>  with ail = - <dig>  nodes. an nd qtl peak  was identified at the same position in the bc <dig> population.

one qtl, qvgt- <dig> / <dig>  with ail = - <dig>  nodes was identified on chr.  <dig>  the il lines sharing similar chr.  <dig> introgressions showed a consistent although not significant effect on dps as well. the presence of a qtl was confirmed by significant nd and ndbe lod peaks and a consistent dps lod profile in the f <dig> population while the bc <dig> map did not properly cover this chromosome region.

on chr.  <dig>  the qvgt- <dig> / <dig> qtl was detected with a rather conspicuous additive genetic effect  and with correlated effects on ndbe and ph and just below significance on dps . confirmation of map location was obtained with the f <dig> qtl analysis for nd, dps, ndbe, ndae and ph. no qtl was identified in this region in the bc <dig> population probably because of the reduced effect of the qtl in the bc <dig>  since the b <dig> alleles showed partial dominance . alternatively, this qtl could be particularly sensitive to environmental cues, since the bc <dig> population was grown in a different year as compared to the il and the f <dig>  and with a late planting date. interestingly, a qtl for photoperiod sensitivity was mapped right at bin  <dig>  in several other studies  <cit> .

the results of the qtl analysis for gdu were virtually equivalent to those for dps  and will not be discussed further.

other il lines showing remarkable flowering phenotypes
a limited number of il lines, namely ill <dig>  ill <dig>  ill <dig>  ill <dig> and ill <dig> , showed flowering time-related phenotypes and yet their introgressed regions were not considered in the qtl summary because of lack of further experimental evidence from other lines or lack of coincidence with the f <dig> and the bc <dig> results. it should be noted that ill <dig>  ill <dig> and ill <dig>  while not showing any nd change when compared to b <dig>  flowered significantly later than the latter. such subtle effect likely went undetected in the bc <dig> and f <dig> populations.

qtls for other traits
in keeping with the high phenotypic and genotypic correlation values, lines showing an effect on nd almost invariably influenced ndbe, with the only exception being the two minor qtls qvgt- <dig>  and qvgt- <dig> / <dig>  a similar trend was observed for ndae, although in this case only three vgt qtls reached significance. the f <dig> qtl analysis confirmed the effects of vgt qtls on ndbe and ndbe, albeit at fewer qtls, in accordance with the lower detection power of the f <dig> experiment.

the gaspé flint introgressions corresponding to qvgt- <dig> / <dig>  qvgt- <dig> / <dig>  vgt1-vgt <dig> and qvgt- <dig> / <dig> significantly affected ph within the il, with the gaspé allele reducing ph. additionally, ph mean values were similarly reduced, albeit not significantly, by the gaspé allele at the other qvgts. the analyses of the f <dig> and bc <dig> identified two additional ph qtls, at bins  <dig> / <dig> and  <dig> / <dig>  respectively, which did not correspond to any qvgts. for the latter qtl, gaspé flint provided the allele with the positive effect.

one line  showed a significant effect on indl, with the gaspé flint allele increasing the trait value . additionally, all other lines carrying introgressions at the same bin  showed a concordant direction of genetic effect . the presence of the indl qtl was confirmed in the f <dig> . the lack of any detectable effect on ph at this chromosome region is probably caused by the balancing effect on ph due to a decrease of nd with a contemporary increase of indl. minor effect indl qtls were identified at bins  <dig> / <dig> and  <dig> / <dig> in the bc <dig>  with gaspé flint providing the positive allele in both cases.

no earn and pndbe qtls were detected in the three populations.

il lines with multiple vgt introgressions
a number of il lines were identified with trait values significantly different from b <dig> and carrying multiple introgressed vgt qtls. while their phenotypic values were not utilized to estimate the qtl effects, such lines are potentially useful for downstream analyses of qtl interaction or for marker-assisted applications. examples of such lines are ill <dig> , ill <dig>  ill <dig>  ill <dig> and ill <dig> .

qualitative traits
a number of clearly qualitative phenotypes segregated within the il. a locus  was found to influence the cracking  of the kernel on the maturing ear  and shown to map at bin  <dig>  as confirmed by four il lines carrying overlapping gaspè flint introgressions. a locus responsible for the presence of a pigmented red band on the tassel outer glumes  was confirmed by three il lines carrying overlapping introgressions at bin  <dig> / <dig> . other il lines showed clear distinct phenotypes . however, because each phenotype was observed based on one il line only, the attribution of these loci to a given chromosome region remains uncertain. we further observed ill <dig> as the only il line with white cobs whereas all other lines and b <dig> had red cobs . this is in accordance with ill <dig> introgression at bin  <dig>  encompassing the p <dig> locus, known to provide pigmentation of the soft floral parts of the cob  <cit> .

discussion
genetic basis of flowering time in maize
the molecular dissection of quantitative traits is moving quickly from qtl to trait mapping, which is not only mapping and cloning one or few qtls but rather the identification of all the major components responsible for the genetic variability of a given trait in a crop species. buckler and co-workers  <cit> , using the nested-association mapping approach identified ca.  <dig> qtls for flowering time at relatively high-resolution. however, even if such qtl map information can now be linked directly to the maize genome sequence  <cit>  and thus to candidate genes, the identification of the causal genes or sequence features  remains unsolved, and will still require the development of targeted cross populations for positional cloning.

the il lines and the qtl results described here provide a starting point for the positional cloning of seven additional flowering time qtls, similarly to what has been achieved for vgt <dig>  although the genetic effects estimated for these vgt loci were considerably smaller than the vgt <dig> one , the mendelization of even the smallest effect qtl , assuming a single causal gene per locus, could be obtained by phenotyping the segmental nearly-isogenic lines for nd based on a low level of replication .

the full genetic dissection of the phenotypic differences between b <dig> and gaspé flint undoubtedly suffered by the incomplete coverage of the gaspé flint genome  and by the partial genotyping. the incomplete coverage could have prevented the identification of additional flowering time qtls while the partial genotyping could have precluded the identification of multiple introgressions within il lines. the latter situation could have lead to both false positive  and false negative , or more generally to biased estimation of effects. such drawbacks were at least partially prevented by carrying out parallel qtl analyses on the b <dig> × gaspé flint-derived bc <dig> and f <dig> populations. in this regard, the comparison of the results of the qtl analyses from the three populations showed that all flowering time qtls  highlighted within the bc <dig> and the f <dig> populations were identified in the analysis of the il. such qtls were the strongest in terms of genetic effect estimated in the il, making unlikely that additional major qtls went unnoticed within the il.

several important biological questions can be addressed based on the availability of this il. as previously observed  <cit> , we confirmed a high correlation between nd and dps. such correlation was also evident if direction and intensity of gene effect at the dps and nd qtl are considered . correlation between two traits paralleled by the coincidence of qtls and concurrent direction of qtl genetic effects have been recognized as indications of prevalent pleiotropy  <cit> . in our case, the causative qtns at the flowering time qtls would influence both nd and dps. because of the developmental architecture of cereals, this translates in allele variation influencing primarily nd and consequently dps. however, linkage of different genes for nd and dps at some of the flowering time qtls cannot be excluded until molecular cloning of these qtls will be accomplished. additionally, we showed that qtls for dps were fewer than qtls for nd and that qtls for dps coincided with qtls for nd. such observations imply that allelic variation at genes influencing the time of switch to the reproductive phase prevails over genetic variation for the rate of development . accordingly, genes known to be involved in maize plastochron  map outside the confidence interval of the vgt qtls. the lack of any qtl involved in plastochron/phyllochron is puzzling. perhaps strong allelic variation for plastochron/phyllochron genes is not compatible with extreme earliness and satisfactory crop production, in such a way that strong plastochron/phyllochron new early alleles were  eliminated unconsciously during the domestication and/or the breeding processes. alternatively, in the early phases of maize domestication and expansion, variation at such genes  was lost. it is noteworthy that three lines  were identified that showed delayed dps without significant effect on nd. unfortunately, the existence of such qtls was not corroborated by multiple il lines and by the bc <dig> and f <dig> qtl results. for these lines, the gaspé flint allele contributed the late allele. altogether, the existence of gaspé flint alleles delaying dps without affecting nd cannot be completely excluded. the observed delay in flowering time could result from i) a general slow plant development or ii) specific delay of tassel and/or flower development and anther extrusion.

as expected and previously observed  <cit> , nd variation also tightly drove variation for ph  and ndbe . unexpectedly, nd variation  also correlated with ndae, with the nd vs. ndae phenotypic correlation r =  <dig>   . one explanation is that ndae  is related to plant height by the presence of a root- or crown-originated acropetal promoting-signal counterbalancing the apical dominance basipetally driven by auxin  <cit> . alternatively, co-segregation for qtls influencing apical dominance along with flowering time is possible. as a matter of fact, the ndae effect detected in this study at bin  <dig> / <dig> coincides with a qtl previously reported for the same trait  <cit> , and a well-supported candidate gene . additionally, the lfy locus, influencing the number of leaves above the ear  <cit> , maps on 3l  <cit> .

only bin  <dig> / <dig> consistently showed an effect on indl, based on il and f <dig> qtl analyses. interestingly, the gene dwarf <dig>  that codes for a p- <dig> cytochrome involved in gibberelline biosynthetic pathway  <cit>  maps within such interval.

ph and indl qtls with positive gaspé flint allelic effect were identified in the bc <dig> and f <dig> populations and not in the il . such result was likely the consequence of the residual heterozygosity of the bc <dig> and f <dig> populations, which drove the expression of heterotic effects on ph and indl.

by producing and testing il lines with introgressions at two or more loci, epistatic interactions among qtls can be addressed in a  powerful way  <cit> . within the b <dig> × gaspé flint genetic background and for flowering traits, the presence of such interactions can be anticipated. the nd genetic effects of all vgt qtls under a fully additive mode summed to  <dig>  nodes where the b <dig> - gaspé flint difference was  <dig>  nodes; on the contrary vgt qtl effects on dps summed to  <dig>  days, whereas the b <dig> - gaspé flint difference was  <dig>  days. such discrepancy is likely the consequence of multiple epistatic effects between different vgt qtls, which could reflect upon nd and dps in different ways. however, additional causes could be  the segregation between b <dig> and gaspé flint of additional flowering loci lacking the strict nd-dps pleiotropism and not represented within the il, and  the effect on the gaspé flint phenotypic mean value of a dominance component originated by the inherent gaspé flint heterozygosity.

molecular bases of flowering time
this il provides the opportunity to test the old hypothesis that the amount of nuclear dna  influences flowering time. maize genome size was shown to be negatively correlated with latitude and length of growing season  <cit>  and selection for earliness was linked with a reduction of c-values  <cit> . similarly, a correlation was found between the presence of knobs  and delayed flowering time  <cit> . gaspé flint has been repeatedly shown to have one of the lowest c-values among the genus zea  <cit>  and to carry the least number of knobs-resident dna repetitive elements in comparison with other investigated inbreds  <cit> .

a number of coincidences of vgt qtls with flowering time qtls mapped in other studies were found. vgt1-vgt <dig> and qvgt- <dig> / <dig> coincided with two of the three highly recurrent consensus qtls identified in a recent survey of  <dig> flowering time qtls  <cit>  and four vgt qtls  overlapped with 'hot-spot' qtls identified after qtl meta-analysis  <cit> . additionally, all the other vgt qtls mapped at regions of relatively high qtl density  <cit> . part of the explanation for such coincidence is likely the redundant use of b <dig> and related inbred lines as parents in many experimental populations  <cit> .

beside vgt <dig>  no other vgt locus has been resolved at the level of candidate sequence and/or qtn. however, evidence of genes possibly involved in flowering time and corresponding to vgt loci  have been collected in at least four studies. an ft-like gene, zcn <dig>  co-mapping with vgt <dig>  was proposed as candidate based on the ft strict homology and pattern of expression profile  <cit> . glossy <dig>  an ap2-like gene closely related with zmrap <dig>  and shown to regulate the juvenility traits and the time to flowering  <cit>  co-maps with qvgt- <dig> . qvgt- <dig> / <dig> overlaps with bif <dig>  a gene for which natural allelic variation has been correlated with flowering time and node number  <cit>  and with an spl-like gene implicated with flowering time in arabidopsis  <cit> . the region of qvgt- <dig> / <dig> harbors a photoperiod-sensitive locus shown to include a ctt-like gene homologous to a heading-date gene of rice  <cit> .

genetics of adaptation to a short growing season environment
our results showed that the extreme earliness of gaspé flint, if compared to standard corn belt lines, is due to allelic variation at several loci, generally detected in other crosses  <cit> , one of which  with sizeable effect. as a next step, it would be valuable to verify to what extent gaspé flint earliness is due to the combination of early alleles commonly present in the maize germplasm or to unique early alleles. the first hypothesis seems to be supported by the results obtained from the positional cloning of vgt <dig>  the major of such flowering time qtls. at vgt <dig>  gaspé has been shown to carry a relatively common haplotype, shared even by medium-late corn belt dent lines  <cit> , tropical germplasms and teosintes  <cit> . additionally, the coincidence of the vgt qtls with many other flowering time qtls supports the notion that gaspé flint alleles are present in other genetic backgrounds. therefore, gaspé flint could be the prototype of an unconscious qtl-allele pyramidization process, carried out by pre-columbian, native american farmers to adapt a tropical species to cultivation at the northern limit of the temperate zone by recruiting alleles for earliness at a number of loci. the importance of the molecular verification of such hypothesis cannot be overemphasized, since qtl pyramiding is at the core of the current genomics-assisted breeding paradigm  <cit> .

nonetheless, it is possible that mutations contributing new early alleles arose uniquely in the gene-pool under selection for earliness, and such mutations remained confined in the northern flints. recurrent mutation at the sugary <dig> locus has already been shown to have occurred during the process that led to the release of modern sweet maize inbreds and cultivars  <cit> . a high mutation rate was also hypothesized to be responsible for the linear response to selection for flowering time, in a selection experiment starting from a small, highly inbred maize population  <cit> . additionally, the extreme plasticity of the maize genome caused by the activity of transposable elements at coding as well as at intergenic regions  <cit>  makes it likely that changes at the regulatory region of flowering time genes could have caused early flowering, and could have recurrently been selected. reinforcing this hypothesis, gaspé flint was already reported to show an unusually high rate of spontaneous mutations  <cit> . if confirmed, such high mutation rate could have provided the unique early alleles upon which selection for earliness acted.

the adaptation of maize, a tropical species, to the northern latitudes, and the molecular changes enabling it, can be set in a rather precise timeframe. maize was domesticated from teosinte in the balsas basin of southern mexico ca.  <dig>  -  <dig>  years ago  <cit> , then reached south western united states ca.  <dig>  years ago and northern united states and canada only  <dig>  years ago, at the time when the very well-defined maize race group, the northern flint, originated  <cit> . the short early maize grown by the penobscot algonkins people in the gaspé peninsula and described by the canadian explorer jacques cartier in  <dig> was likely gaspé flint  <cit> . the relatively late northward expansion of maize could have partially been caused by the complex genetic adaptations  required for the short growing season  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the genetic basis of maize flowering time was investigated using an introgression library developed using the virtually earliest maize cultivar, gaspé flint, and the elite reference inbred line b <dig>  at least eight chromosome regions, including the well-known flowering time locus vgt <dig>  showed allelic variation influencing flowering time. these detected flowering time qtls are involved in determining the number of vegetative phytomeres developed by the maize plant before switching to reproductive phase and do not appear to influence the rate of development . thus, reducing the number of phytomeres seems to have been the key developmental feature enabling the adaptation of a tropical crop species like maize to much northern environments such as southern canada. thanks to the genetic constitution of the plant material  here described, all qtls have been isogenized and are thus available for fine mapping. we anticipate that the availability of this introgression library will further contribute to the dissection and identification of the molecular bases of the rather impressive adapting plasticity of maize.
