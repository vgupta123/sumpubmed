BACKGROUND
mucormycosis are rare but often life-threatening infections seen in immunocompromised, diabetic, and organ transplant patients  <cit> . these infections are difficult to treat and with an increase in the number of diabetic patients and organ transplants, in the future such infections are likely to increase  <cit> . rhizopus spp. accounts for the majority of the mucormycosis infections  <cit> . results in recent decades suggest that apoptosis may play an important role in both establishment and clearance of fungal infections  <cit> . in response to fungal infections, the oxidative burst by host immune cells could help in infection clearance by triggering apoptosis in the fungus  <cit> . also, pathogen-induced apoptosis in host immune cells could help the pathogen to establish the infection  <cit> . thus, the success of an infection partly depends on the outcome of such host pathogen interactions. it has been shown that extracts from the filamentous fungus could induce apoptosis in human cells  <cit> , but the identity of the protein/factor responsible for the induction of apoptosis remains unknown. in recent decades, it has also been established that in many organisms cyt c plays an important role in apoptosis  <cit> . during apoptosis, cyt c is released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and binds to apoptosis protease-activating factor- <dig>  thus triggering a caspase activation cascade  <cit> . for example, in humans, cyt c can activate caspase- <dig> in cell-free activation assay  <cit> . the first evidence of the existence of apoptosis in fungi came from the study by medeo et al. of a saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that showed signs of apoptosis  <cit> . since then, many homologous mammalian apoptotic proteins were discovered in budding yeast  <cit> . in an important finding, using deletion mutants which were unable to produce functional cyt c, silva et al. presented the first evidence that cyt c is involved in hyperosmotic stress induced yeast apoptosis  <cit> . however, the nature of the role cyt c plays in apoptosis of filamentous fungi like r. arrhizus remains unknown.

to characterize r. arrhizus cyt c, we cloned the gene for cyt c from r. arrhizus in e. coli. the purified cyt c was compared with two mammalian cyt c . we selected r. arrhizus cyt c as a candidate for this study mainly for two reasons. first, this fungal cyt c is distantly related to mammalian cyt c and its biochemical properties are largely unknown.

secondly, r. arrhizus is a pathogenic fungus and any information gained on the pro-apoptotic activity of cyt c may also contribute to the identification of better therapeutic targets. we found that cyt c of r. arrhizus has similar biochemical properties to mammalian cyt c.

RESULTS
a 19-fold purification was achieved for recombinant r. arrhizus cyt c using a three step process involving ammonium sulphate precipitation, cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography . the purified recombinant cyt c protein eluted from gel filtration column with absorption ratio 410/280 nm of > <dig>  . purity was also checked by sds electrophoresis. the eluted cyt c produced one band, which had an apparent mw of ca. 14 kda . since this is the first report on purification of recombinant r. arrhizus cyt c, we compared our purification results with those reported by others using similar plasmids. we obtained ~9 mg of cyt c with a 410/ <dig> ratio of > <dig> from 1 l of e. coli culture. our yield was similar to the reported yield for human cyt c of >8 mg l− <dig>  <cit> . patel et al. reported a yield of ~15 mg l− <dig> for horse cyt c  <cit> . however, in that work the authors only performed a two-step purification   <cit> . our yield was only marginally lower if we compare our yield after the second purification step .fig.  <dig>

in the case of the native r. arrhizus cyt c  the final protein eluted from a superdex  <dig> column as a single peak , but the 410/280 nm ratio was only  <dig> . efforts to further purify the native protein using an additional anion exchange column to trap impurities did not result in any improvement.fig.  <dig>

this concurs with a previous study that reported difficulties in purifying this protein from r. oryzae  to high purity  <cit> . the relative molecular weight determined for the native r. arrhizus cyt c by sds-page was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kda  in agreement with expectations for its molecular weight. identity of both, the native and the recombinant protein bands was unequivocally confirmed by maldi tandem mass spectroscopy .fig.  <dig> ms spectra of the recombinant rhizopus cyt c and ms/ms spectra of native rhizopus cyt c collected on a maldi tof/tof instrument. a ms spectra of the recombinant protein digested with trypsin. b ms/ms of precursor peptide  from the native r. arrhizus cyt c protein digested with trypsin. mascot online server was used to confirm the identity of both native and the recombinant proteins



the uv–vis spectra of the oxidized native r. arrhizus cyt c show peaks at  <dig> and 529 nm and in the reduced state, α and β peaks are prominent at  <dig> and 520 nm, respectively . similar values were seen for the recombinant r. arrhizus cyt c. these values are close to other type-c cytochromes, thus suggesting a similar heme environment .table  <dig> comparison of the spectral properties of horse, human and r. arrhizus cyt c

the presence of an absorption maximum at ~700 nm in both recombinant and the native r. arrhizus ferri cytochrome  suggests that, like in other c-type cytochromes, methionine is one of the axial heme ligands. additionally, sequence alignment shows that residues corresponding to met- <dig> and his- <dig> are conserved in  <dig> fungal cyt c  <cit> , as well as in human and horse cyt c.

the redox potential of native and recombinant r. arrhizus cyt c was found to be similar to that of human and horse cyt c, respectively, with no statistically significant difference . the redox potential measurements for human and horse cyt c with  <dig>  and  <dig>  mv, respectively, were in close agreement with earlier reported values validating our technique  <cit> . the redox potential measurements of native and recombinant r. arrhizus cyt c were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mv and statistically the same. these results further support structural similarity between the recombinant and native r. arrhizus cyt c proteins.fig.  <dig> peroxidase activity of native r. arrhizus cyt c as a function of substrate  concentration. shown here is the amount of oxidized abts  formed per minute at different h2o <dig> concentrations . error bars represent the standard deviation



a major portion of cyt c remains loosely associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane via ionic interactions with the negatively charged mitochondrion-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin. kagan et al. had shown that cardiolipin specific peroxidase activity of cardiolipin bound cyt c may play an important role in triggering apoptosis by aiding in the release of pro-apoptotic proteins, including cyt c, from the matrix of the mitochondria  <cit> . furthermore, peroxidase activity assay provides an indirect measure of heme accessibility and we therefore compared the peroxidase activities of mammalian and r. arrhizus cyt c.

the peroxidase activity of native r. arrhizus cyt c was found to be low compared to other known peroxidases, which is a general characteristic of type-c cytochromes. recombinant cyt c showed a higher kcat and vmax compared to native r. arrhizus cyt c. these variations are most likely due to the higher purity of the recombinant protein compared to native one . also, a high peroxidase activity could be related to partial denaturation and thus a more accessible heme in the non-recombinant cyt c. a partial denaturation can involve the breaking of the methionine coordination that leaves the heme more accessible for catalysis  <cit> . however, this is ruled out by the uv-spectra of the recombinant cyt c because they show the presence of the charge transfer band thus indicating that methionine coordination is intact .table  <dig> kinetic parameters for the peroxidase activity of horse, human and r. arrhizus cyt c

native r. arrhizus cyt c showed similar activity as horse cyt c while it was higher than human cyt c . on the other hand, judging from km values the affinity of r. arrhizus cyt c seems to be lower than human cyt c, and very similar compared to horse cyt c . the km value measured for horse cyt c was in close agreement with kim et al.  <cit>  but varied from the one reported by randi et al.  <cit> . it is important to note that we used non-linear regression to analyze the kinetics while the two cited studies used lineweaver-burk plots, a method considered less reliable  <cit> .

we noted the presence of the cyt c in good amounts in a commercial preparation of a secreted lipase of r. arrhizus . interestingly, in an earlier study, the authors have indicated the presence of a “soluble factor” in r. arrhizus extract that can activate caspase, but they did not identify this factor  <cit> . based on these observations, we tried to verify whether this unknown water-soluble factor could be cyt c present in the supernatant of the r. arrhizus cultures or not. efforts to locate the cyt c in supernatant fractions with heme staining  and using an antibody against cyt c were not successful . these results suggest that under our test conditions, the protein is not secreted into the supernatant. however, the possibilities that the protein might be secreted in response to some special cue, or in trace amounts, could not be ruled out.

in the cell free caspase- <dig> activation assay, compared to all cyt c tested, the recombinant r. arrhizus cyt c showed the lowest activity. its activity was similar to the negative control, a cell lysate with asparaginase-ii . the native r. arrhizus cyt c showed a statistically significant  higher caspase- <dig> signal but under the same conditions no statistically significant difference was observed in the signals of recombinant r. arrhizus cyt c and the negative asparaginase-ii control .fig.  <dig> comparison of cell-free caspase- <dig> activation by horse, human and r. arrhizus cyt c. caspase- <dig> activation was followed at 405 nm and normalized to the horse cyt c signal. rra represents the recombinant and nra the native cyt c from r. arrhizus, while aspii represents the negative control contains asparaginase-ii . each column represents the mean of independent measurements, with error bars representing the standard deviation. the initial incubation to activate caspase was performed with samples at 10 μm final concentration. the native cyt c signal  was significantly different from the others 



in our in vitro caspase- <dig> assay, we did not observe any caspase- <dig> activity in the aqueous extracts prepared from the r. arrhizus culture . this result indicate that the source of previously reported activity in the aqueous extract is unlikely to be cyt c  <cit> .

compared to recombinant cyt c, higher caspase- <dig> activation by native r. arrhizus cyt c could be due to the presence of other unidentified factor/s. identity of these factors is a matter of further investigation and beyond the scope of the present study.

additionally, the activation differences between native r. arrhizus and the horse cyt c could be due to the variations in distribution of positive patches on the r. arrhizus cyt c surface, which are known to be critical for cyt c/apaf- <dig> interaction. cyt c and apaf- <dig> interact through an extensive region. many lysine residues  spread across the surface of cyt c are known to be important for this interaction. disruption of these residues by site directed mutagenesis has been shown to abolish or lower the ability of horse and human cytochrome to activate caspases  <cit> . in the case of native r. arrhizus, the reduction in caspase- <dig> activation was seen when compared to horse cyt c. sequence comparison with horse cyt c revealed that in the native r. arrhizus cyt c two of these lysine residues  are occupied by alanine . we propose that these changes to hydrophobic non-polar groups  could decrease cyt c affinity for apaf- <dig>  the lower caspase- <dig> activation by the native r. arrhizus cyt c is a potential reflection of this effect. indeed, these two lysine residues  were demonstrated to be essential for apaf- <dig> binding, since a 10– <dig> fold drop in caspase activity was observed by yu et al. when these amino acids were mutated in combination with other apaf- <dig> interacting residues in horse cyt c  <cit> .fig.  <dig>

in saccharomyces cerevisiae cyt c, a tri-methylation at lysine  <dig> was attributed for being responsible for its lower caspase activation potential  <cit> . we reasoned that it is possible that a similar tri-methylation on the k <dig> in r. arrhizus cyt c could also partly account for its lower caspase activity as seen in our assays . however, our maldi data does not support the presence of lys- <dig> methylation .

we also found four additional lysine substitutions in r. arrhizus cyt c  that have not been studied before, and could potentially contribute to its reduced caspase- <dig> activation . it will be interesting to see if an r. arrhizus mutant with a7k and a25k mutations shows increased caspase- <dig> activation to the level similar to that of horse cyt c, since this would help to elucidate the role of other lysine substitutions seen in r. arrhizus cyt c.

CONCLUSIONS
we have reported here a comparative characterization of r. arrhizus cyt c. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on recombinant purification and biochemical characterization of the r. arrhizus cyt c.

the mitochondrial proteins are attractive targets for new antifungal drugs  <cit> . a better understanding of the role of specific sequences in cyt c’s ability to induce apoptosis and its differences with mammalian cyt c could lead to the identification of methods for exclusive targeting of this fungal pathogen. it will be interesting to see if the amino acid differences in cyt c of r. arrhizus could provide it with sufficient specificity to induce apoptosis exclusively in fungal cells. if this turns out to be the case, designing of fungi specific apoptosis inducing drugs may be possible. although results of targeting human cancer cells by actively inducing apoptosis using mammalian cyt c delivery have been promising  <cit> , replicating them in the fungal cells could be very challenging due to the presence of their cell wall. our results show the ability of r. arrhizus cyt c to activate caspase- <dig>  this finding indicates that this pathogen could potentially use a similar mechanism in vivo to establish infections. to explore the possibility of existence of such mechanism in vivo, a study of clinical isolates and samples from infected patients would be helpful. at present such studies are impeded by the lack of our knowledge about the role of r. arrhizus cyt c in apoptosis. this study will help catalyze exploration into the possible involvement of cyt c in establishing mucormycosis infections.
