BACKGROUND
gene regulatory networks control gene expression in response to both internal conditions  and external signals . the use of combinations of transcription factors in regulatory networks greatly enhances the number of possible gene expression patterns, and enables cells to fine-tune their response to different conditions. combinatorial aspects of gene regulation have been studied both on a whole-network scale  <cit>  and for specific parts of regulatory networks  <cit> . in the present study, we examine combinatorial gene regulation during glucose repression in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.

glucose is the preferred carbon source for s. cerevisiae, which metabolizes glucose by a purely glycolytic process  even under aerobic conditions. fermentation produces fewer moles of atp per mole of glucose than oxidation to co <dig> and h2o, but the rate of atp production is higher, enabling faster growth  <cit> . during fermentative growth, nadh is regenerated by reducing the pyruvate that is formed to ethanol, which is then exported from the cell. once the glucose has been consumed, the cell switches to aerobic metabolism of the ethanol. this switch is called the diauxic shift.

the difference between fermentative and aerobic growth is in part mediated by a regulatory mechanism called glucose repression  <cit> . glucose repressed genes can be divided into three groups. the first includes genes needed for uptake and metabolism of other carbon sources, such as galactose, maltose, and ethanol. glucose repression of these genes overrides specific induction, such as galactose induction of the gal genes. the second group includes genes needed for the krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which are dispensable during fermentative growth. the third group of glucose repressed genes are those involved in gluconeogenesis, which need to be repressed on glucose to prevent futile cycling.

the main effector in glucose repression is mig <dig> , a zinc finger protein that binds to the promoters of many genes and represses their transcription  <cit> . repression by mig <dig> can be both direct and indirect, through repression of genes encoding transcriptional activators. one example of this are the gal genes, which are repressed both directly by mig <dig>  and indirectly through repression of the gal <dig> gene  <cit> . yeast has two other zinc finger proteins that are closely related to mig1: mig <dig> and mig <dig>  <cit> . mig <dig> seems to be a minor player in glucose repression. some glucose repressed genes are synergistically repressed by mig <dig> and mig <dig> while others are repressed only by mig <dig>  no genes have so far been shown to be repressed only by mig <dig>  mig <dig> has been reported to contribute marginally to glucose repression of some genes  <cit> .

mig <dig> is negatively regulated by snf <dig>  a protein kinase present in all eukaryotes . snf <dig> is called the amp-activated protein kinase in animals, where it is regulated by amp. this kinase has a general function in energy homeostasis  <cit> . it is activated at low energy conditions and restores the energy level by stimulating energy producing processes and inhibiting energy consuming processes. yeast snf <dig> is inhibited in the presence of glucose, which can be regarded as a high energy condition. in the absence of glucose, snf <dig> phosphorylates mig <dig>  this causes nuclear exclusion of mig <dig>  <cit>  and prevents its interaction with the cyc8-tup <dig> co-repressor  <cit> , thereby causing derepression of glucose repressed genes. glucose repression thus involves three consecutive negative steps: glucose inhibits snf <dig>  which inhibits mig <dig>  which represses target genes  <cit> .

there is also a glucose induction pathway in yeast, which activates genes required for uptake and metabolism of glucose . it works through the two glucose sensors snf <dig> and rgt <dig>  <cit> . in the presence of glucose, snf <dig> and rgt <dig> generate a signal that stimulates degradation of mth <dig> and std <dig>  two proteins that are required for expression of rgt <dig>  <cit> . rgt <dig> is a gal4-related zinc cluster protein that represses the glucose induced genes  <cit> . the end result is therefore that these genes are derepressed, i.e. induced, in the presence of glucose.

the nuclear localization of mig <dig> is not controlled by glucose, and there is no evidence that mig <dig> is regulated by snf <dig>  instead, the mig <dig> gene is induced by glucose  <cit> . mig <dig> is under dual level control by glucose. thus, the mig <dig> gene is glucose induced  <cit> , and the mig <dig> protein is subject to snf1-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent degradation in the absence of glucose  <cit> . the mig <dig> gene is also induced by genotoxic stress, and there is evidence that mig <dig> functions as a downstream effector in the snf1-dependent response to hydroxyurea  <cit> . finally, there is cross-talk between the glucose repression and glucose induction pathways. thus, snf <dig> and mth <dig> are repressed by mig <dig>  and mig <dig> is repressed by mig <dig>  <cit> .

mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig> have similar dna-binding zinc fingers, and the residues thought to be important for the dna specificity  <cit>  are conserved. the site bound by mig <dig> is well characterized and consists of a gc-rich core, ggg , and an at-rich region 5' to the gc-box  <cit> . no mismatches are allowed within the gc-box, but one or two c's or g's are tolerated within the at-box  <cit> . mig <dig> and mig <dig> have both been shown to bind to some mig <dig> sites in vitro  <cit> , but the precise specificity of either protein has not yet been determined.

several previous studies have investigated the roles of mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig> in gene expression. the expression of five reporter genes were examined in different mutants using β-galactosidase fusions  <cit> . filter hybridizations were used to compare expression of a subset of the yeast transcriptome in a mig <dig> mig <dig> mig <dig> triple mutant and the wild type, after which β-galactosidase fusions were used to further study the expression of  <dig> genes  <cit> . a genome-wide study that identified promoter regions bound by different transcription factors included data for mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig>  <cit> . finally, microarrays were used to study gene expression in several mutants affecting glucose signaling, including mig <dig> and mig <dig> mig <dig> mutants  <cit> . none of these previous studies has provided a comprehensive picture of how the expression of the entire yeast transcriptome is affected by mig <dig>  mig <dig>  and mig <dig>  we have now undertaken such a comprehensive study in order to elucidate combinatorial effects in glucose repression, and to better understand the different roles played by mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig> 

RESULTS
in order to elucidate how the three related yeast repressors mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig> contribute to the control of gene expression, we used microarrays to study the expression of all yeast genes in the wild type and all seven possible combinations of mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig> deletions. since mig <dig> and mig <dig> both are involved in glucose repression, the experiments were carried out in the presence of 2% glucose. each experiment was performed at least in triplicate, with independent biological samples. to facilitate the analysis, and to reduce the number of false positives, we used the following criteria for which genes were further considered: genes whose average expression went up or down at least 2-fold in at least one comparison between different mutants, and where the effect was significant at p <  <dig>  when comparing data from replicate arrays.

partial redundancy of mig <dig> and mig <dig>  but not mig <dig>  in gene regulation
using these criteria, we found that  <dig> genes are upregulated and  <dig> genes are downregulated in response to a deletion of mig <dig> and/or mig <dig>  as compared to the wild type . these genes are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig>  of these,  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant. in the mig <dig> single mutant,  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes downregulated. as expected, most of these genes are included in the larger set of genes that are affected in the double mutant . to quantify the redundancy in regulation by mig <dig> and mig <dig>  we calculated a redundancy measure, r, which is  <dig> if a gene shows complete redundancy in its dependence on mig <dig> and mig <dig> , and  <dig> if a gene depends only on mig <dig> . another way to interpret r is as a measure of the contribution of mig <dig>  with  <dig> indicating that mig <dig> can fully control expression of the gene in the absence of mig <dig>  and  <dig> indicating that mig <dig> does not at all contribute to its regulation. the genes were then divided into three sets: genes with r ≥  <dig>  were considered as completely redundantly regulated, those with  <dig>  ≤ r <  <dig>  as partially redundantly regulated, and those with r <  <dig>  as being regulated by mig <dig> alone.

as seen in figure 2b, we found that of the  <dig> genes that are upregulated in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant,  <dig> show either complete or partial redundancy in their dependency on mig <dig> and mig <dig> while  <dig> genes are regulated by mig <dig> alone. this is consistent with previous findings that while some glucose repressed genes are repressed by mig <dig> alone, most depend on both mig <dig> and mig <dig>  <cit> . for activated genes, i. e. genes that are downregulated in the mutants, we saw a similar pattern, with  <dig> of  <dig> genes showing complete or partial redundancy for mig <dig> and mig <dig>  and  <dig> genes being affected only by mig <dig> .

in the mig <dig> single mutant, only two genes were upregulated using our criteria, but they failed to appear in other comparisons involving mig <dig>  however, hxt <dig>  which was a borderline case  showed a smaller  but still significant increase in the mig <dig> single mutant. further studies using real-time pcr confirmed that hxt <dig> is upregulated in mig <dig> strains . a deletion of mig <dig> had very limited effects in our experiment. only four genes were upregulated more than 2-fold, and only one of them, mrk <dig>  has a mig <dig> site in its promoter and is also upregulated in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant. nor did a deletion of mig <dig> in the mig <dig> and mig <dig> single or double deletion mutants have any further effects. as discussed below, the sir <dig> gene is upregulated in the mig <dig> mutant, but sir <dig> is not a target for mig <dig> or mig <dig>  we conclude that mig <dig> does not contribute much to the regulation of the genes that are regulated by mig <dig> and mig <dig>  at least not on 2% glucose.

the degree of mig1/mig <dig> redundancy correlates with gene classification
interestingly, we found that the degree of redundancy  is strongly correlated with certain functional annotations. this is particularly true for genes that are upregulated in the mutants . since most of these genes have mig <dig> binding sites in their promoters , we consider them to be likely direct targets of mig1/mig2-dependent repression. genes that are repressed only by mig <dig>  are enriched for the annotation hexose transport. moreover, several other genes in this group  are involved in other kinds of transport. genes under partially redundant repression are enriched for the annotation carbohydrate metabolism, and many previously known glucose repressed genes fall into this category. the group of genes that are completely redundantly repressed by mig <dig> and mig <dig>  finally, includes genes involved in phosphate metabolism  and is therefore enriched for the annotation phosphoric monoester hydrolase activity. pho <dig> was the most strongly affected gene in the yeast genome, being upregulated 56-fold in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant, whereas pho <dig> and pho <dig> had the highest redundancy measures of all genes . for genes that depend on mig <dig> and/or mig <dig> for activation, i. e. are downregulated in the mutants , we found that redundant regulation is strongly correlated with the annotation ribosome biosynthesis and assembly, and that partially redundant regulation correlates with maturation of small subunit rrna. no annotation was significantly enriched among the seven genes that depend on mig <dig> only.

mig <dig> sites and stre motifs are both enriched in promoters that are repressed by mig <dig> and/or mig2
as expected, the promoter regions of all genes that are repressed by mig <dig> and/or mig <dig> are enriched for the mig <dig> site ggg . in total, 96% of the repressed promoters contained at least one mig <dig> site, as compared to 41% of all yeast promoters. surprisingly, we found that these promoters are also enriched for the stre element agggg . the stre element is also a gc-rich sequence, but it does not bind mig <dig> or mig <dig>  instead, it is the target of four other zinc finger proteins, msn <dig>  msn <dig>  gis <dig> and rph <dig>  which are involved in various types of stress signalling  <cit> . it should be noted that stre elements are more common in promoters that also contain mig <dig> sites. we therefore tested if this correlation can explain the enrichment of stre elements in promoters that are repressed by mig <dig> and/or mig <dig>  our analysis suggests that this is indeed the case.

it is not clear why mig <dig> sites and stre motifs occur in the same promoters. however, we note that many genes that contain stre motifs are upregulated during the diauxic shift, when glucose is depleted  <cit> , so dual control of these genes by glucose repression and stress signalling is not unexpected. genes that contain the pds element, a third motif through which gis <dig> and rph <dig> act, are also upregulated during the diauxic shift  <cit> . however, unlike the stre elements, we did not find any significant enrichment of pds elements in the promoters of genes that are repressed by mig <dig> and/or mig <dig>  nor is the pds element overrepresented in genes that contain mig <dig> sites .

nucleosome displacement and nucleosome phasing at functional mig <dig> sites
it is not unusual for promoters to contain cryptic binding sites for transcription factors, that are not used in vivo due to an unfavourable position or context. consistent with this, many genes with mig <dig> sites in their promoters are not significantly upregulated in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant. we wished to determine if there is a difference in nucleosome occupancy at mig <dig> sites in promoters that are regulated by mig <dig> and/or mig <dig> and those that are not, which would support the notion that the latter contain cryptic rather than functional mig <dig> sites. we therefore used nucleosome occupancy data  <cit>  to examine nucleosome positioning around mig <dig> sites in both sets of genes. as a control, we used the stre element, which as discussed above also is enriched in the promoters of genes that are regulated by mig <dig> and/or mig <dig> 

promoters generally contain fewer nucleosomes, which is evident from the v-shaped troughs in all nucleosome occupancy plots in figure  <dig>  however, as shown in figure 3a, we found that nucleosome occupancy at mig <dig> sites is lower in promoters of mig1/2-repressed genes than in other promoters with mig <dig> sites . since nucleosomes and transcription factors frequently prevent each other from accessing dna, the reduced nucleosome occupancy at mig <dig> sites in mig1/2-repressed genes is a further validation that these sites are functional. for the stre elements, we saw a different pattern . thus, the nucleosome occupancy at stre elements is higher in promoters of mig1/2-repressed genes than in other promoters . these results support the notion that the mig <dig> sites, but not the stre elements, are important for repression mediated by mig <dig> and mig <dig> 

interestingly, we further found that nucleosome occupancy downstream of functional mig <dig> sites is clearly phased, with an average distance between peaks of  <dig> base pairs . in contrast, no clear phasing was seen upstream of functional mig <dig> sites, around cryptic mig <dig> sites , or around the stre elements in either sets of genes . we conclude that this nucleosome phasing is specific for functional mig <dig> sites. it suggests that nucleosomes bind in an ordered fashion downstream, but not upstream, of functional mig <dig> sites.

redundantly downregulated promoters are enriched for pho <dig> binding sites and a novel gggagg motif
we proceeded to study how the specificity of the combinatorial regulation is achieved, i.e. what makes downregulation of some genes depend only on mig <dig> whereas other genes depend redundantly on both mig <dig> and mig <dig>  we examined six possible hypotheses: a) variations in the sequence of the mig1/ <dig> site account for different binding affinities of mig <dig> and mig2; b) the importance of the flanking at box for binding differs between mig <dig> and mig2; c) sites at different positions in the promoter may be differentially recognized by mig <dig> or mig2; d) mig <dig> and mig <dig> have preferences for different orientations of the binding sites; e) the number of mig <dig> sites is important; and f) other dna motifs are involved.

the only two hypotheses for which we found strong support were a) and f). starting with the latter, we found that two other dna motifs, the pho <dig> binding site cacgt and the motif gggagg, are significantly overrepresented in genes that are redundantly repressed by mig <dig> and mig <dig>  . the presence of pho <dig> sites in this set of genes is consistent with our finding that it is enriched for genes annotated for phosphoric monoester hydrolase activity. it is not known what yeast transcription factors, if any, bind to the gggagg motif, nor has it previously been associated with a specific group of genes. the single gene that had neither a pho <dig> binding site nor a gggagg motif, eds <dig>  encodes a zinc cluster protein with unknown function. however, the closest relative of eds <dig> is the rgt <dig> repressor involved in glucose induction. this raises the possibility that eds <dig> also is involved in glucose control of gene expression, which could explain its unusal mode of repression by mig <dig> and mig <dig> 

redundantly repressed promoters are enriched for a variant mig <dig> site which is absent from promoters repressed only by mig1
as stated above, we also found strong support for hypothesis a), i.e. that the sequence of the mig <dig> site is important for the degree of redundant repression. thus, using the bcrank program , we found that a variant of the mig <dig> site, gtggggg, is significantly enriched  in the promoters of the redundantly repressed genes . in total,  <dig> of the  <dig> redundantly repressed genes, including eds <dig>  have the gtggggg motif in their promoters. interestingly, we further noted that the  <dig> genes that are repressed only by mig <dig> do not contain a single such variant mig <dig> site. this prompted us to further test the hypothesis that this motif is important for redundancy by looking at the fraction of gtggggg motifs among all mig <dig> sites in the three groups of genes. as shown in table  <dig>  the variant motif accounts for  <dig> of  <dig> mig <dig> sites in the promoters of the redundantly repressed genes, which is a significant overrepresentation . among promoters that are repressed only by mig <dig>  the motif is found at  <dig> of  <dig> mig <dig> sites, which is a significant underrepresentation . promoters that show partially redundant repression by mig <dig> and mig <dig> do not differ significantly from the expected number of variant motifs.

promoters whose activation depend on mig <dig> and/or mig <dig> are enriched for pac and rrpe motifs
some of the genes that are downregulated in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant have mig <dig> sites in their promoters , but these sites are not significantly enriched in this group of genes. this suggests that most of these genes are not direct targets for activation by mig <dig> or mig <dig>  we therefore considered the possibility that some of them could be regulated indirectly, by a repressor that is glucose repressed. one obvious example are the two low affinity hexose transporters hxt <dig> and hxt <dig>  that are known to be regulated by the rgt <dig> repressor. however, rgt <dig> sites are not enriched among all promoters that depend on mig <dig> and/or mig <dig>  instead, we found that two other motifs are significantly enriched among these promoters: the pac motif  and the rrpe site . these two motifs are known to be involved in regulation of rrna processing genes  <cit> , which is consistent with the annotations ribosome biogenesis and assembly and maturation of small subunit rrna being enriched among redundantly activated genes . the rrpe site is bound by stb <dig> which activates transcription in response to glucose  <cit> , but expression of stb <dig> was not affected by deletions of mig <dig> or mig <dig> in our microarray experiments . it is not known which transcription factors, if any, bind to the pac site.

combinatorial regulation of the hxt genes by mig <dig> and mig2
the hxt genes are interesting for two reasons: they are subject to both glucose induction and glucose repression, and different hxt genes respond differentially to different levels of glucose  <cit> . our finding that hxt <dig> is one of the few genes whose expression is more sensitive to mig <dig> prompted us to examine the expression of the hxt genes in detail, using real-time pcr and two different glucose concentrations. thus, we measured the expression of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt6/ <dig> in the mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig> mig <dig> strains grown on either 2% or 10% glucose .

we found that hxt <dig> is redundantly repressed by mig <dig> and mig <dig> on 2% glucose. this is in agreement with earlier findings  <cit>  and with our microarray data in . on 10% glucose, there was a similar but stronger effect, especially in the mig <dig> and mig <dig> mig <dig> strains. this suggests that mig <dig> is more important on 10% glucose than on 2% glucose. the hxt <dig> gene was only repressed by mig <dig> on 2% glucose. again, this is in agreement with earlier results  <cit>  and with our microarray data. on 10% glucose, however, hxt <dig> was repressed by both mig <dig> and mig <dig>  with mig <dig> seemingly being the stronger repressor. it was even more so than for hxt2; it therefore seems that mig <dig> is more important for repression on 10% glucose than on 2% glucose.

the high affinity transporter genes hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> are highly homologous, differing in only three nucleotide positions. this makes it very hard to distinguish between the two transcripts when measuring gene expression. we were therefore only able to measure the combined expression of hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> in our real-time pcrs, and it is likely that the microarray data for either gene also is the sum of the expression of the two genes. this is not a serious drawback since all previous evidence suggests that these two duplicated genes are identically regulated, but the caveat must be added that we could not tell them apart.

interestingly, hxt6/ <dig> is one of the few cases where mig <dig> seems to be more important for repression than mig <dig> on 2% glucose. thus, we saw a small  but significant increase in hxt6/ <dig> expression in the mig <dig> strain as compared to the wild type, and a further increase  in the mig <dig> mig <dig> strain, which is consistent with the microarray data in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  also consistent with the latter, we saw no difference in expression in the mig <dig> strain. on 10% glucose the pattern was even more pronounced, with a 7-fold increase in the mig <dig> strain as compared to the wild type, a 19-fold increase in the mig <dig> mig <dig> strain and no significant effect in the mig <dig> strain. thus, hxt6/ <dig> seem to be regulated by both mig <dig> and mig <dig>  with mig <dig> being the main repressor. this is the case both on 2% and on 10% glucose, but again the effect of the mig <dig> deletion is much stronger on 10% glucose.

expression of the hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> genes encoding the two low affinity transporters was only studied in the microarray experiment, i. e. on 2% glucose. it has previously been reported that hxt <dig> is downregulated in response to a deletion of mig <dig> and mig <dig>  <cit> . we saw the same effect. thus, hxt <dig> was downregulated to 4% of the wild type in the mig <dig> mig <dig> strain, and no effects were seen in single mutants . this suggests that mig <dig> and mig <dig> function redundantly in their positive effect on hxt <dig> expression. the hxt <dig> gene, finally, was slightly upregulated in the mig <dig> mutant  and downregulated in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant .

the sir <dig> gene is downregulated by mig3
as noted above, we found no evidence that mig <dig> regulates the same set of genes as mig <dig> and mig <dig> on 2% glucose. in fact, only one of the genes in figure  <dig>  mrk <dig>  was upregulated in the mig <dig> deletion. moreover, the four genes that were upregulated more than 2-fold in the mig <dig> deletion  were not significantly upregulated in the mig <dig> double and triple deletions. however, when we included genes that are upregulated more than  <dig> -fold in the mig <dig> deletion, we found one gene which fulfills both criteria: a low p-value  and a significant upregulation also in the mig <dig> mig <dig>  mig <dig> mig <dig> and mig <dig> mig <dig> mig <dig> strains relative to the wild type. this was the sir <dig> gene, which encodes a histone deacetylase involved in silencing. the effect of the mig <dig> deletion on sir <dig> expression was a  <dig>  fold increase. to confirm that sir <dig> is downregulated by mig <dig>  we proceeded to measure the expression of sir <dig> by real time pcr. again, we saw a small  but significant  increase in sir <dig> expression in the mig <dig> strain . the mechanism behind this regulation remains to be determined, but we note that the sir <dig> promoter does not contain a mig <dig> site.

discussion
we have used microarrays to study gene regulation by the three yeast zinc finger proteins mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig>  in particular, we wanted to investigate to what extent they cooperate in gene regulation, and whether such cooperation is redundant or synergistic. to this end, we studied the expression of all yeast genes in all possible combinations of mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig> deletion mutants. consistent with previous studies  <cit> , we found that mig <dig> and mig <dig> regulate an overlapping set of genes on 2% glucose , with mig <dig> being the most important regulator. thus, some genes depend only on mig <dig>  other genes are regulated both by mig <dig> and mig <dig>  but very little effect is seen when only mig <dig> is deleted .

interestingly, we further found that the degree of redundancy in regulation by mig <dig> and mig <dig> correlates with the gene ontology classification, indicating that genes involved in the same type of processes show a similar type of regulation . this was particularly evident for repressed genes, i.e. genes that are upregulated in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant. thus, genes that are repressed only by mig <dig> tend to be involved in transport , genes that are repressed mostly by mig <dig> but also to some extent by mig <dig> are involved in carbohydrate metabolism and genes that are repressed redundantly by mig <dig> and mig <dig> tend to be involved in phosphate metabolism. we further note that most of the genes that are repressed by mig <dig> and/or mig <dig> are expressed after glucose depletion  <cit> , which is consistent with them being controlled by glucose repression.

our finding that a variant mig <dig> site, gtggggg, is significantly enriched in redundantly repressed promoters, but absent from promoters repressed only by mig <dig>  suggests that differences in sequence specificity between mig <dig> and mig <dig> may account for different modes of regulation. according to this model, mig <dig> would have a narrower sequence specificity than mig <dig>  furthermore, genes that are redundantly repressed would contain mig <dig> sites that can also bind mig <dig>  while genes repressed only by mig <dig> would lack such sites. our results suggest that gtggggg may, indeed, be one such variant motif capable of binding mig <dig>  but it cannot be the only one, since several redundantly repressed genes lack this motif. further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis and to determine the precise binding specificity of mig <dig> 

in addition to the gtggggg motif, we found that the redundantly repressed promoters are enriched for two other motifs: the pho <dig> binding site , and the novel gggagg motif. pho <dig> is a downstream effector in the pho pathway, which activates genes encoding phosphatases , phosphate transporters  and other genes involved in phosphate utilization in response to phosphate starvation  <cit> . our finding that redundantly repressed genes are enriched for pho <dig> binding sites is therefore consistent with our finding that these genes tend to be involved in phosphate metabolism. we interpret this as correlation rather than causation, i. e. the pho <dig> sites are found in these genes because they are involved in phosphate metabolism, and not because pho <dig>  directly or indirectly, contributes to the redundant mode of repression. consistent with this, expression of pho <dig> is not affected by deletion of mig <dig> or mig <dig>  neither is expression of components in the pho pathway such as pho <dig>  pho <dig>  pho <dig> or pho <dig> . also, there is no significant depletion of nucleosomes around pho <dig> sites in the promoters of the redundantly repressed genes, compared to pho <dig> sites in all other promoters .

the gggagg motif has not previously been described in yeast, and it is not known which proteins, if any, bind to it. the mammalian zinc finger proteins sp <dig> and sp <dig> bind to this motif   <cit> , but the dna specificity of the gc-box binding zinc finger proteins  is determined by amino acid residue  <dig> in each finger  <cit> , and there is no reason to expect that mig <dig> or mig <dig> would bind to this motif. we further make three observations. firstly, among the  <dig> redundantly repressed genes, those containing pho <dig> binding sites  and the gggagg motif  are largely complementary . secondly, these two groups cover  <dig> of the  <dig> genes. thirdly, genes with the gggagg motif include nth <dig> encoding a trehalase, hor <dig> encoding a glycerol-3-phosphatase, and gac <dig> encoding a protein phosphatase  <dig> regulatory subunit. these proteins are all directly or indirectly connected to phosphate metabolism. we conclude that most of the redundantly repressed genes are involved in phosphate metabolism, and usually contain either pho <dig> binding sites or gggagg motifs, but rarely both. this suggests that the gggagg motif may bind a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in phosphate metabolism that are not directly regulated by pho <dig> 

the physiological reason for this unexpected link between glucose repression and phosphate metabolism remains to be determined. one connection found in the literature is the fact that a deletion of snf <dig> causes a defect in glycogen accumulation, which can be suppressed by mutations in pho <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that pho <dig> may be involved in mediating regulation of glycogen by snf <dig>  furthermore, it has been shown that the gsy <dig> gene encoding glycogen synthase is regulated both by mig <dig> and pho <dig>  <cit> . there are also other, more general connections between glucose and phosphate signalling in yeast. thus, it has been shown that addition of phosphate to phosphate starved cells affects a number of known targets of the pka pathway, and that this effect is dependent on the presence of glucose and requires at least one of the two glucose sensing systems in the pka pathway  <cit> . finally, glucose depletion causes degradation of the pho <dig> phosphate transporter  <cit> .

at first sight, the fact that genes involved in phosphate uptake and salvage are repressed by mig <dig> and mig <dig> seems counter-intuitive, since phosphate is required for glucose metabolism. furthermore, pho <dig> and pho <dig> are both downregulated when glucose is depleted  <cit> , where one would instead expect mig1/2-repressed genes to be upregulated. one possible explanation for pho <dig> and pho <dig> being downregulated after the diauxic shift is that they also are regulated by other signaling pathways that turn off their expression whether or not glucose is present. in particular, phosphate limitation comes to mind. however, we note that pho <dig> and pho <dig> are more highly expressed on 2% glucose also during logarithmic growth  <cit> . the question then remains why pho <dig> and pho <dig> are upregulated in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant. it is possible that this reflects a repression at high glucose concentrations, which is partially active on 2% glucose, and that the downregulation in the absence of glucose is due to these genes also being glucose induced. however, it is also possible that mig <dig> and mig <dig> repress pho <dig> and pho <dig> in response to some other signal than glucose.

for pho <dig>  its upregulation in the mig <dig> mig <dig> double mutant is consistent with the fact that it is downregulated by 2% glucose and upregulated after glucose depletion  <cit> . what is intriguing in this case is the fact that pho <dig> shows the strongest response of all yeast genes to loss of both mig <dig> and mig2: a 56-fold upregulation . for comparison, suc <dig>  a classical target of glucose repression, is upregulated only 21-fold. it should further be noted that this effect is much greater than the 3-fold difference seen in pho <dig> expression in the presence or in the absence of glucose  <cit> . this again raises the question whether the effect of the mig <dig> mig <dig> double deletion just reflects loss of glucose repression, or whether mig <dig> and mig <dig> regulate pho <dig> is response to some other signal than glucose. we note that pho <dig> is known to be induced by cell wall damage in addition to being regulated by phosphate  <cit> .

interestingly, we found that for the hxt genes, the relative importance of mig <dig> and mig <dig> as repressors depends on the glucose concentration. at 2% glucose mig <dig> is the major repressor, and the effects of a mig <dig> deletion are seen only in the absence of mig <dig>  on 10% glucose, mig <dig> is more important. the clearest example of this is repression of hxt <dig>  which depends only on mig <dig> on 2% glucose, but on both mig <dig> and mig <dig> on 10% glucose . the same trend, with mig <dig> being more important on 10% glucose, is also seen for hxt <dig> and hxt6/ <dig> . if this result can be extended to other glucose repressed genes, it may explain why mig <dig> has seemed to be of minor importance in previous studies  <cit> . it should be noted that the natural habitat of yeast, fermenting fruits and grapes, contains high concentrations of glucose. mig <dig> could thus be more important under these conditions than under standard laboratory conditions. however, we note that differential repression makes sense for the hxt genes, where transporters with different affinities need to be expressed at different glucose concentrations. it remains to be seen how important differential regulation by mig <dig> and mig <dig> is for other glucose repressed genes.

it should be emphasized that the fact that the genes repressed only by mig <dig> are enriched for the annotation hexose transport does not mean that all hxt genes are regulated in this way. in fact, the hxt genes respond differently to different glucose concentrations and to deletions of mig <dig> and mig <dig>  consistent with the fact that they encode transporters with different affinities that are needed at different glucose concentrations. thus, the high affinity transporter genes hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> are repressed only at high glucose concentrations, and it therefore makes sense that they are among the few genes that are more sensitive to mig <dig>  furthermore, we note that whereas the hxt <dig> gene is repressed only by mig <dig> on 2% glucose, mig <dig> contributes significantly to its repression on 10% glucose. this could mean that the above discussed binding site specificities are relative rather than absolute, and that mig <dig> may recognize all mig <dig> sites, though with different affinities. in conclusion, the use of mig <dig> and mig <dig> would enable yeast cells to fine-tune their response to different concentrations of glucose.

the reason why mig <dig> and mig <dig> respond to different glucose levels in regulating the hxt genes remains to be determined: activation of mig <dig> by glucose involves inhibition of snf1-dependent phosporylation of mig <dig>  <cit> , which in turn permits mig <dig> to enter the nucleus  <cit> . there is, however, no evidence that mig <dig> is controlled by snf <dig>  nor is its intracellular localization regulated by glucose  <cit> . instead, the mig <dig> gene is glucose induced  <cit> . it is likely that this, combined with glucose repression of mig <dig>  <cit> , is the reason why mig2-dependent repression of the hxt genes is more prononuced at higher concentrations of glucose. furthermore, we note that glucose induction of mig <dig> expression can provide an explanation for the observation that hxt <dig> expression is regulated by snf <dig>  <cit> , since glucose induction depends on snf <dig>  <cit> .

in contrast to the extensive functional overlap between mig <dig> and mig <dig>  we saw no evidence that mig <dig> regulates the same set of genes as mig <dig> and mig <dig>  at least not on 2% glucose. it has previously been reported that mig <dig> contributes marginally to repression of some glucose repressed genes, i. e. suc <dig>  hxt <dig>  snf <dig>  mrk <dig> and mth <dig>  <cit> , but only one of these, mrk <dig>  was affected in our mig <dig> deletion. mrk <dig> is a protein kinase involved in stress signaling  <cit> , which is interesting since mig <dig> has been implicated in the response to genotoxic stress  <cit> . however, the most significant effect of a mig <dig> deletion  in our microarrays was on the sir <dig> gene, which was upregulated also in the mig <dig> double and triple mutants. furthermore, this effect was found to be significant when verified by real-time pcr .

sir <dig> encodes a histone deacetylase which is involved in silencing, but sir <dig> has also been implicated in maintaining genome integrity  <cit> , and in counteracting aging in both yeast and animals. a sir <dig> deletion reduces the replicative life span  <cit>  but increases the chronological life span of yeast  <cit> . little is known about regulation of sir <dig> expression. our finding that mig <dig> downregulates sir <dig> provides a possible explanation for the observation that reduced snf <dig> activity leads to accelerated aging in yeast  <cit> , since snf <dig> inhibits mig <dig>  <cit> . the latter effect was discovered within the context of the genotoxic stress pathway, and the fact that sir <dig> is involved in the maintenance of genome integrity  <cit>  would make it a logical target for that pathway. however, turnover of mig <dig> was also regulated in a snf1-dependent way by the carbon source  <cit> , and the possibility therefore exists that mig3-dependent regulation of sir <dig> could respond to nutrient signaling pathways that are involved in the control of aging in yeast  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
combinatorial gene regulation, where several transcription factors together regulate a set of target genes, enables cells to fine-tune their responses to different conditions. we have examined the role of three related yeast zinc finger proteins, mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig>  which mediate signals from at least two signaling pathways . to elucidate how the three proteins contribute to the control of gene expression, we used microarrays to study the expression of all yeast genes in the wild type and in all seven possible combinations of mig <dig>  mig <dig> and mig <dig> deletions. our data shows that mig <dig> and mig <dig> repress overlapping sets of genes, with mig <dig> being the major repressor on 2% glucose, whereas mig <dig> appears to be more important at higher glucose concentrations. several genes that are redundantly repressed by mig <dig> and mig <dig> are involved in phosphate metabolism, and the promoters of these genes are enriched for a variant mig <dig> site which is absent from genes repressed only by mig <dig>  mig <dig> does not seem to target the same genes as mig <dig> and mig <dig>  instead, mig <dig> represses the sir <dig> gene encoding a histone deacetylase which is involved in gene silencing and the control of aging.
