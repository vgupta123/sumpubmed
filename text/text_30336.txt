BACKGROUND
genomic information can increase our understanding of the molecular evolutionary processes that drive speciation  <cit> . comparative genomic and transcriptomic studies have provided a framework for understanding how genes and genomic sequences relate to adaptation and phenotypic evolution at the organismal level  <cit> . many of these comparative studies  <cit>  identify coding genes that are subject to rapid divergence and positive selection, a process where mutations are advantageous and favored. either a single mutation or an accumulation of advantageous mutations can contribute to the process of adaptive evolution. the identification of positive selection at the molecular level has been frequently estimated by the calculation of nonsynonymous  and synonymous  substitutions, in which a ka/ks ratio greater than one is an indication of positive selection and a value less than one is indicative of negative or purifying selection, the purging of deleterious alleles . genes under positive selection are generally categorized within comparative genomic studies under processes such as biosynthesis, development, metabolic processes, immune function and reproduction  <cit> . as more genomic and transcriptomic information becomes available, we can reaffirm or redefine which processes are pertinent to the processes of adaptation and speciation.

identifying the mechanisms of speciation within marine systems has been a daunting and difficult task. most studies, post mayr  <cit> , have focused on identifying geographic barriers that would prompt allopatric speciation  <cit> . however, within marine ecosystems there are limited geographic barriers that would prevent allopatric speciation  <cit> . this concept suggests a marine-speciation paradox, where incipient species that come into contact frequently would prevent allopatric speciation  <cit> . rockfishes , an example of adaptive radiations within marine ecosystems, provide an ideal model system for understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the speciation process. the rockfish genus sebastes provides a unique model system for studying adaptive evolution because of the extensive diversity found within this group, which includes variation in morphology, ecology, and a broad range of life spans  <cit> . this rapid radiation is supported by multiple studies which demonstrate the diversification of this group from a phylogenetic context . ingram  <cit>  showed evidence that rockfish speciation is associated with the divergence of habitat depth and depth-related morphology, which supports that this group of fishes are undergoing ecological speciation along an environmental gradient. additionally, complex courtship displays and internal fertilization are found within rockfishes, making assortative mating likely  <cit>  and can help us understand how sexual selection is operating within this group.

divergent sexual selection can facilitate the speciation process via reproductive traits that form a barrier between incipient species and result in reproductive isolation . other factors like spawning time, mate recognition, environmental tolerance, and gamete compatibility are thought to contribute to the marine speciation process  <cit> . several molecular evolutionary studies have demonstrated that genes associated with reproduction  have rapidly diverged between closely related taxa . swanson and vacquier  <cit>  suggested that the rapid divergence within reproductive genes may stem from a single or combination of selective pressures such as sperm competition, sexual selection and sexual conflict. levitan and ferrell  <cit>  demonstrated how sperm competition operates within male and female sea urchins  in which mating pairs that had the most common bindin  genotypes had higher reproductive success in the presence of low polyspermy—the fertilization of an egg with multiple sperm. however, when polyspermy levels were high, males and females with unmatched bindin genotypes had the selective advantage. this depicts an “arms race” between sperm and egg proteins, in which sperm competition is a source of directional selection, and egg proteins are also under selective pressures to develop barriers against polyspermy  <cit> . although a vast amount of information supports the rapid diversification of reproductive genes, very little is known about the forms of selection operating on these genes  <cit> . most studies on gamete evolution within marine systems have been performed with free spawning organisms . in contrast, marine rockfishes have matrotrophic viviparity, the process where the eggs are fertilized internally and the mother provides nutrition to the developing embryo and the offspring are expelled as larvae  <cit> . the latter is not a common life history trait in a majority of extant bony fishes. the evolutionary processes of gamete recognition proteins within this group are unknown. however, multiple paternity has been demonstrated within multiple species within sebastes, including s. goodei  <cit> , which permits the opportunity for selective forces to operate on reproductive proteins .

a prime candidate for understanding reproductive barriers at the molecular level is the zona pellucida  gene family, which encodes for glycoproteins that create the acellular vitelline envelope around the oocyte . the function of zp proteins varies in fishes and includes uptake of nutrition, functional buoyancy  <cit> , protection of the growing oocyte, species-specific binding, and guidance of the sperm to the micropyle  <cit> . there are at least eight zp genes in many fish species  <cit>  that belong to three subfamilies: zpb, zpc, and zpax  <cit> . the subfamily zpa is missing from fishes, which may be due to a gene deletion  <cit>  and subfamilies zpc and zpb are known to contain gene duplicates  <cit> . selection has been tested in zpc genes in six teleost species, but the results have been inconclusive due to the lack of robustness in the statistical methods used  <cit> . in this study, we wanted to address more closely the hypothesis that genes in the zp family may provide a reproductive barrier between closely related species.

rockfishes  are a prime system for understanding adaptive radiations and the mechanisms of speciation within marine systems  <cit> . adaptive radiations involve rapid divergence of multiple lineages, which serve as replicates of speciation within a given environment or time frame  <cit> . sebastes spp. has been considered an ancient species flock  <cit> , a group of closely related species with a monophyletic origin  <cit> . the genus arose around  <dig> mya, contains  <dig> recognized subgenera  <cit> , and approximately  <dig> species found worldwide  <cit> . aside from being a diverse group of fishes, there is an extensive difference in lifespans within rockfishes; the shortest-lived rockfish species is calico rockfish  at 12 years and the longest-lived rockfish is rougheye , which have a maximum lifespan of 205 years  <cit> . in addition, this genus is composed of species that are morphologically and ecologically divergent  <cit> , with the center of diversity for this group being located in the northeast pacific  <cit> . though many studies have concentrated on describing species-level variation , very few studies have investigated the genetic mechanisms that have contributed to this radiation  <cit> .

in this study, our aims were to identify and characterize genes subject to positive selection between two marine fish species in sebastes. we used a comparative transcriptomic approach, in which we characterized and compared transcriptomes generated from gonadal tissues of the two species s. goodei and s. saxicola. we selected s. goodei   <cit>  and s. saxicola   <cit>  based on the extensive amount of evolutionary time since their most recent common ancestor  was that each library was prepared with the latest sequencing technology that was available at the time. we annotated the function of expressed genes using gene ontology , and identified signatures of positive selection from estimates of ka/ks ratios for ortholog pairs that we annotated between these two species. genes that were found to be evolving under positive selection were further analyzed in the context of their orthologs in model fishes and ests from our earlier study  <cit> . in addition to identifying selection through analysis of coding regions, we additionally estimated genetic divergence between the two species in untranslated regions . overall, this study was developed to understand how differences at the transcriptomic level contribute to adaptive evolution within this speciose group.

RESULTS
sequence statistics and annotation
the s. goodei ests contained  <dig> and  <dig>  raw sequences respectively and a mean est length of  <dig>  and 614 bp respectively . we assembled  <dig> unigenes, which were composed of  <dig> singletons and  <dig> contigs from ovary tissue, and  <dig> singletons, and  <dig> contigs from testes tissue. when processed through a second run of cap <dig>  <cit> , the  <dig> sequences were reduced to  <dig> contigs and used for our comparative analyses with s. saxicola.

the s. saxicola ests contained a primary assembly of  <dig>  reads and  <dig>  clean reads. the primary assembly contained  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  contigs with 71 % redundancy . from these  <dig>  sequences, a second assembly was processed and contained  <dig>  singletons,  <dig>  primary contigs, and  <dig>  secondary contigs. only sequences that were assembled into contigs and greater than 300 bp were used for our comparative analyses resulted in  <dig> primary contigs and  <dig>  secondary contigs were used with a total of  <dig>  contigs.

there were  <dig> and  <dig> sequences from s. goodei and s. saxicola datasets respectively that were annotated. within the s. goodei and s. saxicola datasets, there were gene ontologies  terms within the biological process domain, that belonged to the cellular process, metabolic process, biological process, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, cellular component organization, response to stimulus, localization, signaling, cellular component biogenesis, reproduction, death, growth, cell proliferation, immune system process, and multi-organism process. most go terms represented for molecular function pertained to binding, catalytic activity, transcription regulator activity, molecular transducer activity, transporter activity, enzyme regulator activity, structural molecule activity, and electron carrier activity. the majority of go terms represented for cellular component pertained to the cell, organelle, macromolecular complex, membrane-enclosed lumen, extracellular region, and synapse.

our annotations of the two  transcriptomes were relatively similar across the major three divisions  when levels  <dig> and  <dig> go terms were compared. in most go terms, s. goodei were slightly elevated, with  <dig> annotated contigs and for s. saxicola- <dig> contigs. although there were differences between the two sequencing methods, there were similarities in go categories between the two transcriptomes. in addition, the two datasets showed 16 %  and 17 %  of go terms annotated to reproduction and 35 % and 39 % for developmental processes , which may provide an overview of reproductive processes within ovary tissues. in addition, the dual use of testes and ovary tissues from s. goodei contained similar go terms between s. saxicola in which these two tissue types may contain similar go functional traits.

genes under positive selection
two hundred and nine ortholog pairs contained a ka/ks less than  <dig> ,  <dig> pairs were between  <dig> – <dig>   and  <dig> pairs that were found greater than one , which amounts to  <dig> orthologs in total. seventy-one of these pairs were annotated with a majority of the sequences that were associated with macromolecule metabolic processes and regulation of biological processes based on the sequence distribution of gene ontologies . only a small fraction of the distribution of gos were associated with reproductive process  and sexual reproduction . the average ka/ks value was  <dig>  , and the average ortholog alignment length of  <dig>  . there was no enrichment found between these two categories with a false discovery rate of .fig.  <dig> plot of  nonsynonymous vs.  synonymous substitutions. blue diamonds indicate values with a ks <  <dig> , whereas red triangles indicate ks values greater than  <dig>  but less than  <dig> . the black line suggests neutrality, values above the line are subject to positive selection and values below are subject to purifying selection

discussion
this study identifies genes under positive selection between the gonadal transcritomes of two distantly related rockfish species .  <dig> orthologous gene pairs were identified between the two species and of these we found  <dig> genes under positive selection. genes found under positive selection did not overlap with the genes found in a previous sebastes comparative transcriptome study  <cit> , which is not surprising given the differences in the tissue types. however, we did find similar functional traits  for genes under selection. in the earlier study, the transcriptomic analysis was conducted with brain, pituitary, kidney, and spleen tissues, which may differ in expression patterns from gonadal tissues. gene expression among different tissue types is still being teased apart, as genes once thought to be expressed in a tissue specific fashion have been identified in multiple tissues  <cit> . in addition, the examination of a set of candiate genes from the zona pellucida gene family did not reveal strong signs of positive selction, as has been found in other vertebrates. lastly, we used divergence estimates of the utrs to further support that orthologs were identified for our study and not paralogs. as more rockfish tissue-specific transcriptomic information becomes available, the determination of whether certain genes subject to positive selection belong to specific tissues can be determined. this information allows us to better understand how reproductive genes have contributed to the process of adaptive radiation within this group of fishes.

comparison of the two datasets
the combination of sanger and  <dig> sequencing technologies have been beneficial for increasing the amount of transcriptomic information available for non-model species  <cit> . in rainbow trout , the combination assembly of sanger and  <dig> sequencing showed high similarities with other fish species that have their genomes sequenced  <cit> , which provides support that the combination of the two technologies do not generate disparities or conflicting information. caveats seen with  <dig> sequencing is that singletons contained elevated insertions in mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> , and also high errors rates have been found within homopolymer repeats  <cit> . we did not include singletons in our study and we saw very similar annotations for the two datasets. in addition, we were able to obtain a substantial number of orthologs between the two species datasets  which suggests that the different sequencing technologies did not hinder our analyses.

natural selection
our scan for genes under positive selection also includes genes with elevated ka values  that contained go terms that were associated with adult life spans and gamete function/production. genes with only nonsynonymous substitutions and assigned with go terms associated with gamete production/function were the t-complex protein  <dig> and lissencephaly- <dig> homolog. study on zona pellucida –  <dig>  and the t-complex protein  <dig>  and immune system protein β2m in a group of closely related murine species  contain sites under positive selection  <cit> . t-complex protein  <dig> is expressed during spermatogenesis in murids  <cit> , but the specific function is still unknown. this gene is highly expressed within mouse testes and is suggested to maintain normal spermatogenesis. lissencephaly- <dig> has been demonstrated to be conserved  <cit>  when compared between mice and humans. this gene has been shown to demonstrate infertility when a homozygous mutant has been developed  <cit> . the likely scenario for elevated ka values found in these genes is because these are only fragments of the entire gene sequence. these genes would be interesting to examine at the population level within each respective species in order to determine whether there is variation found at both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites.

ortholog pairs under positive selection with a ka/ks >  <dig> and go terms associated with gamete production/function were deadenylating nuclease, dna ligase iii, dna mismatch repair protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig>  and homolog subfamily a member  <dig> . dna repair mechanisms have a strong relationship with gametogenesis, where the genomes of gametic cells are subject to mutations following recombination  <cit> . within these gametic cells the repair mechanisms have to tolerate mutations that occur during gametogenesis which result in specialized functions  <cit>  that are possibly due to selective pressures. deadenlyating nuclease has been suggested to silence maternal mrna during oocyte formation  <cit> , this is particularly interesting due to the transcript comparison between s. goodei testes and s. saxicola ovary tissue. homolog subfamily a member  <dig> is known to be part of the dnaj family, which is assigned to the structurally unrelated protein family of heat shock proteins   <cit> . in humans, this gene is expressed in brain tissue, but many homologs within the family are associated with sperm motility. recent study has shown there are differences in reproductive genes between infertile vs. fertile human males, in which dnaj subfamily a was represented  <cit> . clearly, these genes need to be further investigated to understand the mechanistic and functional properties within rockfishes to understand how these genes are subjected to positive selection.

within our scan for positively selected genes we identified genes associated with longevity. although the two species have similar lifespans, there are extensive differences between life spans across species within the genus  <cit> , and genes associated with longevity were identified within our previous study  <cit> . the congener closely related to s. goodei is s. paucispinis  <cit> , which can live to at least 46 years  <cit> . by comparison, the nearest congener to s. saxicola is s. semicinctus, which can live up to 15 years  <cit> . the genes identified here and associated with longevity were eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> subunit  <dig>  cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5a, 40s ribosomal protein x isoform, and 60s ribosomal proteins l <dig> and l <dig>  and protection of telomeres protein  <dig> . these genes associated with longevity are particularly interesting and hold the potential key for understanding how aging operates in this group of fishes. as more rockfish genomic information becomes available this will provide a clearer depiction of the patterns of longevity and how this may impact adaptation.

the genes that showed evidence of positive selection in our paml analysis were 12-kda fk506-binding protein  and transmembrane protein 50a . fkb <dig> is known to be associated with various cellular functions that include apoptosis, cell-cycle progression, and calcium release  <cit> . genes that encode for the mechanisms of apoptosis have been suggested to be under positive selection  <cit> . speculation for why these genes are under selection is due to the genomic conflict that would occur as a result of apoptosis during spermatogenesis  <cit> . as for tm50a, this gene encodes for a membrane protein and the function of this gene within fishes is unknown. there is more information needed to determine how these genes contribute to adaptation within sebastes.

other comparative transcriptomic analyses of candidate systems for adaptive radiations, such as crater lake cichlid fishes  <cit>  and east african cichlid fishes  <cit> , showed a limited number of genes found under positive selection, which was less than 1 % and ~  <dig>  % respectively, . from these studies on cichlids, some of the genes under positive selection that were comparable to our study were: transmembrane protein, cytochrome c oxidase, lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase, ribosomal proteins from baldo et al.  <cit>  and rna-binding from elmer et al.  <cit> . these genes would be of interests to investigate further since they are found under positive selection within multiple examples of adaptive radiations, which includes our study.

currently, there is much debate over the assessment of natural selection at the molecular level. however, one of the limitations to these analyses are that current statistical methods estimate ka/ks across an entire gene and does not account for the relaxation of purifying selection, and/or the effects of population bottlenecks  <cit> . in addition, estimates of ka/ks demonstrate a conservative estimate of positive selection, because most of the protein is under a functional constraint and only a few amino acid sites would be subject to positive selection  <cit> . however, within many comparative genomic studies there are genes that have been identified under positive selection which encode for proteins with immune or reproductive functions  <cit> . although there may be difficulties detecting selection, there are reoccurring gene functions that are subject to positive selection. within our study, we have identified certain genes under positive selection that encompassed a broad range of go terms where a majority of terms include: cellular process, metabolic process, biological regulation, response to stimulus, multi-cellular organ process, cellular component organization, developmental process, localization, signaling, and reproduction. the specifics about how these genes under positive selection contribute to adaptation within heterogeneous environments remains unknown, but provides a suite of candidates for understanding why these genes have been identified as nonsynonymous substitutions in comparison to the remainder of the transcriptome.

zona pellucida
current evidence shows that there are six subfamilies of zona pellucida genes in vertebrates   <cit>  and these are homologous with the zp domain found within invertebrates  <cit> . our phylogenetic construction of the zp family suggests there is only one zpax gene, two  zpb homologs, and seven  homologs in our dataset. most zp genes within the rockfish genome grouped with oreochromis niloticus and oryzias latipes, which suggests these genes have arisen in a similar pattern from a recent common ancestor .

in our estimation of ka/ks of ten zp gene pairs most pairs contained a broad range of ka/ks values  with only one ortholog pair that was subject to positive selection . both zpb homologs  were not used to construct phylogenetic trees because these sequences provided limited phylogenetic information  and were shorter than the sequences used for our phylogenetic analyses. however, these genes are divergent from the remaining zp homologs and an ortholog from one of the model teleost could not be detected. it is unknown if some of these zp homologs are specific to the sebastes lineage, where more information from species within this genus and closely related genera or families would be needed to make this assessment. currently, there is no evidence of teleost zp genes subject to positive selection  <cit> , however this was assessed with a select few model fishes . this poses the question of whether there is enough evidence to show that zp genes do not provide evidence for positive selection within teleost or is there some other mechanism that would prompt reproductive barriers? these methods are more stringent at identifying selection and the addition of more taxa from sebastes can provide insight on how these genes have contributed to the radiation within this group.

utr analysis
untranslated regions  provide a reference of divergence between species and can be utilized as a base for comparing synonymous substitutions within coding regions that are assumed to be evolving neutrally. our estimation of 3’ and 5’ utr divergence is unprecedented within the genus sebastes. our estimated values of utr divergence between s. goodei and s. saxicola were not statically similar to the ks values . in addition, the utilization of the cutoff mark  is not an essential benchmark for the removal of aligned pairs as putative paralogs according to our utr analysis . interestingly, the ks coding region and 3’ utr divergence between crater lake cichlid fish species contained rates of  <dig>  and  <dig>   respectively which had a common ancestor ~  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . this provides an interesting comparison of freshwater  and marine fishes , where utr divergence was similar between cichlids and rockfishes but ks values were different. hurst  <cit>  suggesteded that synonymous rates are relatively proportional to the neutral mutation rate, which suggests that the utrs and ks are relatively close to this rate. however with species that are more divergent, there are distinct differences between synonymous rates and utr divergence. divergence within closely related drosophila species are distinct where 3’ utr and 5’ utr rates are lower than synonymous sites when comparing d. melanogaster and d. simulans  <cit> , which diverged ~ 2– <dig> mya  <cit> . our study did not have similar ks and utr rates as compared to the elmer et al.  <cit>  study, which may be due to the amount of time since divergence . suggestions have been made that lower utr divergence in comparison to synonymous sites in drosophila is likely to be subject to negative selection, which is consistent with our findings  <cit> . this pattern of 3’ utrs subject to purifying selection has also been identified within chimpanzees and humans  <cit> . more evidence will be required to demonstrate the impact of negative selection on the marine rockfish genome, which analyzing the utrs from closely to distantly related congeners can provide insight on this evolutionary pattern.fig.  <dig> comparison of utr divergence with alignment length and ks divergence. blue diamonds indicate ortholog pairs with a ks >  <dig> , whereas red triangles indicate ks values that are greater than  <dig>  and less than  <dig> 



the use of the utrs has been a useful indicator for assigning the correct ortholog pairs as opposed to paralogs, in addition to the algorithms used in inparanoid  <cit> . depending on the function of the gene, utrs can be highly conserved between orthologs and divergent between paralogs once a gene duplication event has occurred, which has been demonstrated between humans and mice  <cit> . one of the many difficulties of identifying orthologous gene pairs within teleosts is the proposed fish specific genome duplication  event which occurred ~  <dig> mya  <cit> . this event provides a plethora of gene duplicates that may operate under different evolutionary pressures such as subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, and pseudogenization. with this magnitude of gene duplicates, the assignment of orthologous gene pairs can be difficult because of the amount of duplicates that are closely related. in our study, we showed lower rates of divergence within the utr region in comparison to the synonymous sites of these two species. if we constructed an alignment of utrs from a pair of paralogs in which the paralogs arose due to the fsgd, then there would be an expected high degree of divergence as opposed to the divergence rate of true orthologs. however, exceptions may occur with recent gene duplications and/or concerted evolution permits for paralogs to be subjected to similar selective pressures. if we can detect novel genes within this genus we can gain a better perspective of the rate of divergence occurring within the utr region. understanding the importance and evolutionary patterns of novel genes is a promising avenue with the advent of next-generation sequencing.

CONCLUSIONS
this transcriptomic study between s. goodei and s. saxicola provides a template for understanding evolutionary processes at the molecular level within sebastes. we identified a series of candidate genes that are useful for the assessment of the critical genes that diverged and are responsible for the radiation within this group. genes that pertain to longevity hold potential for understanding the molecular mechanisms that have contributed to the radiation within this genus. the establishment of genes under positive selection from this study can be insightful and utilized to assess whether these positively selected genes are under selection across the entire genus sebastes. if these genes are under positive selection across the entire genus, this will provide new clues about how natural selection is contributing to speciation by reproductive isolation within this group. this study was intended to further advance the field of evolutionary biology by providing support of which functional genes are important for adaptation and sexual selection. with transcriptomic data from multiple species within sebastes, we can identify the repeated patterns of adaptive evolution and elucidate our understanding of how adaptation and the speciation processes occurred across the entire genus of sebastes.
