BACKGROUND
the discovery of the brca <dig> and brca <dig> genes as major breast cancer susceptibility genes led to great advances in the genetic screening for the disease and the understanding of its inheritance  <cit> . several other genes were found to play a role in increasing susceptibility to breast cancer but at a markedly lower frequency and penetrance. these genes include atm, tp <dig>  check <dig>  pten, stk <dig>  palb <dig>  brip and the rad <dig> genes  <cit> . gwas studies led to the identification of  <dig> susceptibility loci that are considered only as low risk alleles  <cit> . all these factors combined can account for only 35% of heritable breast cancer with the majority of cases remain with an unknown genetic etiology  <cit> . this problem is confounded for the admixed and consanguineous population of the western region of saudi arabia where virtually no research has been done so far to elucidate the genetic background of heritable breast cancer. a remarkable characteristic of breast cancer in this population is the relatively younger age of onset of the disease where the majority of cases  are diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma before they are  <dig> years old  <cit> . this early onset could be attributed, at least partly, to undetermined genetic susceptibility factors accumulating in the population due to consanguineous marriages and increased exposure to environmental insults due to life-style shifts in the past two decades.

sanger sequencing of all known breast cancer susceptibility genes could be a daunting task. developments in massively parallel sequencing technology and whole-exome sequencing alleviate many of the problems associated with such approach and allow for the simultaneous determination of known factors as well as the discovery of novel ones. and in the age of personalized medicine, whole-exome sequencing of each breast cancer patient is fast becoming a standard approach towards genetic diagnosis  <cit> . in the present study we employed whole-exome sequencing of seven cases diagnosed with familial breast cancer and with unknown brca <dig> or brca <dig> status. we determined the brca <dig> and brca <dig> status in these cases and report the identification of several rare variants that can potentially explain breast cancer susceptibility in each case analyzed.

materials and methods
patients’ samples
patients were selected for this study if they have a first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer. peripheral blood was obtained from the patients following obtaining their informed consent and their family history of breast cancer. patients’ recruitment and blood sampling was all performed according to the institutional ethical procedures . genomic dna was prepared using the qiagen qiaamp dna blood mini kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

whole-exome sequencing and snp genotyping
three micrograms of genomic dna was sheared using the covaris s <dig> system. exome capture was performed on seven cases and six non-cancer controls using the sureselect whole-exome enrichment version  <dig> kit from agilent. fragment libraries were prepared from the captured exomes for sequencing on the solid  <dig> platform . sequencing for each library was performed on one part of the quad slide and fragments were sequenced in in single reads of  <dig> bp. sequence capture and primary analysis were performed by the instruments ics and sets softwares. snp genotyping using taqman was performed using assay id  from life technologies targeting the rs <dig> snp. genotyping was performed on dna from peripheral blood of breast cancer patients or non-cancer controls.

analysis pipeline
color-space sequences in .csfasta and .qual files were exported to lifescope software were mapping to the human genome version  <dig>  was performed using standard settings. identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms was achieved by the dibayes software incorporated in the lifescope pipeline. variant call format  files were analyzed using the snps & variation suite  <dig>  from golden helix where short-listing of candidate snvs was performed by filtering the detected snvs to include only those with more than 10x coverage and mqv of >= <dig>  rare variants were identified by filtering out snvs present in the 1000genomes or nhlbi exome sequencing data. disease-associated snvs were determined following filtering out rare snvs found in the  <dig> non-cancer control cases from the same ethnic background. damaging nonsynonymous variations were determined by the sift, polyphen or mutation taster softwares within the svs <dig> suite.

RESULTS
exome sequencing revealed several single nucleotide variants affecting key genes that could be involved in increased susceptibility to breast cancer. the single nucleotide variants or short indels obtained for every sample were filtered against the nhlbi exome project and the 1000genomes project databases. novel or rare variants  were filtered against our in-house database of exome sequencing of non-cancer patients or healthy individuals. the statistics of each breast cancer exome sequenced are shown in table  <dig>  the mutational status of brca <dig> and brca <dig> in the sequenced samples was unknown. therefore, variants affecting those genes were analyzed first. we have identified one novel frameshift mutation affecting brca <dig> caused by an -/ac insertion affecting one patient only . other brca <dig> or brca <dig> variants identified were previously reported in dbsnp <dig>  however, the nonsense variant represented by snp rs <dig> is very rare and no information about its maf could be found. we have found this variant in one bc patient only. other missense single nucleotide variants affecting brca <dig> and brca <dig> were identified. however, when selection is based on rarity and degree of predicted damage to the protein, snp rs <dig> is found in one patient. in order to determine the frequency of the rs <dig> snp in our cohort, we performed taqman® snp genotyping assay on dna obtained from the peripheral blood of  <dig> breast cancer patients samples as well as  <dig> non-cancer controls. the rs <dig> snp was in a highly significant hardy-weinberg disequilibrium in the patient group  compared to the control group . the gg state of the rs <dig> snp is significantly associated with breast cancer compared to the aa and ag states combined .

predisposition to breast cancer is often caused by genetic defects in dna repair mechanisms. therefore, snvs affecting known genes with dna repair function were examined . in addition, snvs were also identified affecting the apc, egf and egfr genes. an interesting mutation c.148g>a / p.ala62thr is found affecting the parp1-interacting region of the cockayne syndrome group b  gene. analysis of dna from the family of the affected female revealed that this mutation segregated in the heterozygous state in one sibling affected with breast cancer as well as in the mother who also suffered from breast cancer. the father did not harbor this mutation . this snv was recently reported by the 1000genome project  where it was found only once in  <dig> individuals. we could not detect this snv in  <dig> non-cancer control samples from saudi arabia.

discussion
breast cancer incidence is on the rise in the kingdom of saudi arabia with a remarkable number of those affected are being diagnosed before they are  <dig> years old  <cit> . the early-onset of the breast cancer in this population could be partly explained by the accumulation of breast cancer predisposition genetic factor due to high incidence of consanguineous marriages. the effects of these genetic factor is probably becoming more evident now due to the social and life-style changes brought upon by the relatively recent positive economical upheavals in the country. in order to identify such genetic factors, we performed a pilot whole-exome sequencing study on dna obtained from the peripheral blood of seven cases suffering from hereditary breast cancer. first, the status of the known breast cancer predisposition factors, mainly brca <dig> and brca <dig>  was determined. we could not identify recurrent brca1/ <dig> mutations in our cohort. however, we identified a novel insertion that led to a frameshift mutation  in brca <dig> causing the synthesis of a truncated and presumably dysfunctional protein. we identified another rare mutation in brca <dig> in one of our patients. represented by the rs <dig> snp, the p.arg2494stop affecting brca <dig> has been reported by the breast cancer information core submitted by myriad genetics as a direct result of their diagnostic services. additionally, we have identified the relatively rare rs <dig> snp in brca <dig> which is a p.gln356arg mutation reported by the 1000genomes project to have an maf of  <dig> . we found this snp in our cohort with a maf of  <dig>  . the minor allele frequency of the rs <dig> snp did not differ significantly from controls. however, we observed an increase in the number of breast cancer cases displaying the homozygous gg minor allele state that is not seen in the control cases. when the gg state is analyzed in comparison to the combined frequency of the aa and ag states, a highly significant association with breast cancer becomes evident. the rs <dig> snp is one of  <dig> snps in cancer predisposition genes that were identified to confer minor but cumulatively significant risk of breast cancer  <cit> . however, a later study dismissed the association of the rs <dig> snp with breast cancer  <cit> . unfortunately, it is difficult to perform direct comparisons between our findings and reported studies due to the differences in sample size and the ethnic makeup of the cohorts analyzed.

whole-exome sequencing revealed several candidate risk factors for breast cancer. we made the assumption that the most likely risk factor is a gene involved in dna repair, cell cycle or apoptosis  <cit> . applying this filter to the snvs obtained reveal rare polymorphisms that could affect important genes such as wrn, apc, egf, egfr and ercc <dig>  the contribution of these snvs towards increasing predisposition to breast cancer remains unknown. therefore, we analyzed the segregation with breast cancer of the snvs affecting ercc <dig>  and wrn  in a family with reported breast cancer affecting three generations . the wrn p.ala616pro was detectable in the two siblings diagnosed with breast cancer. however, this snv could not be found in the mother who died of breast cancer. in contrast, the ercc <dig> p.ala62thr snv segregated with breast cancer in the same family and it was not detectable in the father or control samples. this mutation affects the parp1-interaction region of ercc <dig>  also known as cockayne syndrome group b   <cit> . ercc6-dependent activation of the polypolymerases, or parps is an early event in the cellular response to genotoxic stress  <cit> . carrying a variant ercc <dig> therefore will cause a less-efficient dna repair response and could therefore lead to an increased predisposition to breast cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report on the breast cancer predisposition factors in the population of the kingdom of saudi arabia. the high consanguinity and life-style shifts in this population are coupled to an early-onset breast cancer and the snvs identified in this study could partly explain this phenomenon. we have identified a novel brca <dig> mutation as well as found a case with a very rare nonsense mutation truncating the brca <dig> protein. we demonstrate the potential importance of the homozygous risk allele to breast cancer predisposition in the saudi population. we suggest that mutations in the ercc <dig> gene could be considered as potential risk factors for breast cancer. although no recurrent mutations were identified, this study validates the use of whole-exome sequencing for the determination of the “breast cancer predisposition genome”.
