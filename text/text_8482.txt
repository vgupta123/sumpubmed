BACKGROUND
many plant species are able to flower in the seasons best suited to their reproduction. this ability depends mainly on the accurate measurement of seasonal changes in day length and temperature  <cit> . rice is a short-day plant, i.e. it requires a photoperiod shorter than a critical day length for heading and flowering to occur  <cit> .

during last two decades, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular regulation of heading date in rice  <cit> . rice photoperiodic flowering is controlled by two independent signaling pathways. the osgi–hd1–hd3a pathway  is evolutionarily conserved in rice, as is the gi–co–ft pathway  in arabidopsis. hd <dig> was the first heading date qtl cloned on the basis of natural variation in rice accessions  <cit> . hd <dig>  a homolog of arabidopsis co, promotes heading under short-day length  conditions and represses it under long-day length  conditions. hd <dig> promotes hd3a expression under sd conditions, but inhibits hd3a expression under ld conditions  <cit> . the repression of heading by hd <dig> under ld conditions is enhanced by the kinase activity of hd <dig> , which is the α-subunit of casein kinase  <dig>  <cit> . hd3a functions as a florigen  <cit> . another florigen gene, rft <dig> , is a tandemly duplicated paralog of hd3a  <cit> . rft <dig> expression increases under ld conditions, indicating that rft <dig> is an ld-specific florigen  <cit> . the other signaling pathway includes ehd <dig>  and ghd <dig> . ehd <dig> encodes a b-type response regulator, which promotes flowering. ehd <dig> affects the levels of hd3a and rft <dig> transcripts  <cit> . ghd <dig> encodes a cct -domain protein. ghd <dig> represses ehd <dig>  hd3a, and rft <dig> under ld conditions, but does not affect hd <dig> mrna levels  <cit> . many other genes for heading date have been identified, and their genetic pathways have been well characterized in rice  <cit> .

a wide range of variation in heading date has been observed among rice accessions  <cit> . more than  <dig> qtls for heading date have been detected using segregating populations derived from crosses among rice accessions and wild relatives; they are distributed over all  <dig> rice chromosomes . to date,  <dig> qtls have been cloned by map-based cloning strategies : hd <dig>  <cit> , hd <dig>  <cit> , hd3a  <cit> , ehd <dig>  <cit> , ghd <dig>  <cit> , dth <dig> , dth <dig> , hd <dig> , dth <dig> , hd <dig> , rft <dig>  <cit> , ehd <dig> , and osprr <dig> . sequence analysis of these genes indicated that allelic differences contribute greatly to heading date variation  <cit> . for example, functional and nonfunctional alleles of hd <dig> are associated with late and early flowering, respectively, and hd <dig> is a major determinant of natural variation in heading date in cultivated rice  <cit> . deficient or weak alleles of ghd <dig>  dth <dig>  dth <dig>  hd <dig>  and osprr <dig> are distributed in northern cultivation areas at high latitudes  <cit> , strongly suggesting that such deficient and weak alleles are involved in the expansion of rice cultivation areas. favorable alleles were probably selected by breeders to enhance rice productivity and adaptability for each cultivation region.

genome-wide studies have revealed the divergence of the genetic architecture of flowering time or heading date control in other plant species such as arabidopsis and maize  <cit> . in arabidopsis, flowering time variation is controlled by allelic differences of a small number of genes with large genetic effects  <cit> , whereas in maize natural variation of heading date is controlled by the additive effect of many qtls with small effects  <cit> . we previously reported a qtl mapping study using 12 f <dig> populations derived from crosses of the japonica rice accession koshihikari , a common parental line, with diverse accessions originating from various regions of asia  <cit> . the study detected one to four qtls with large effect in each f <dig> population; however, it also indicated that these qtls cannot fully explain the varietal differences in heading date in some cross combinations. generally, it is difficult to detect qtls with small effects in primary mapping populations, e.g., f <dig> populations  <cit> . therefore, it is very likely that additional qtls are also involved in the phenotypic variation for heading date in these populations.

to reveal the genetic architecture of natural variation for heading date in rice by detecting the hidden qtls, we developed advanced-backcross populations  derived from crosses with the same f <dig> populations. advanced-backcross populations are promising materials for detecting a lot of qtls involved in variation of heading date in asian rice accessions. detection both of large- and small-effect qtls enable us to estimate the genetic architecture of heading date of asian rice accessions. we compared genomic positions between detected qtls and rice heading date genes previously isolated using the map-based cloning strategy, and investigated sequence polymorphisms of the heading date genes in asian rice accessions. we also discuss similarities and differences in the genetic architectures of heading date  among plant species.

we selected  <dig> rice accessions that originate from various regions of asia to develop diverse backcrossed populations derived from crosses of these accessions with the japonica accession ksh as a common parental and recurrent line . the accessions  were selected on the basis of their geographical origin, cluster analysis of genome-wide rflp data, and variation in days to heading  from a representative rice collection  <cit> . these accessions were used previously as donor parents to produce f <dig> populations  <cit>  and backcrossed inbred lines at bc1f <dig> generation  <cit> . crosses were performed with f <dig> derived from crosses between those accessions and ksh, and then backcrosses were performed to produce bc1f <dig>  bc2f <dig>  bc3f <dig>  and bc4f <dig> individual plants . from  <dig> to  <dig> individual plants were backcrossed in each generation of all of the  <dig> cross combinations. bc4f <dig> plants were self-pollinated to produce bc4f <dig> progenies, and bc4f <dig> plants were self-pollinated to produce bc4f <dig> progenies. we used bc4f <dig> populations for qtl detection, and bc4f <dig> populations for confirmation of additive effects and chromosomal regions of the putative qtls.table  <dig>

scoring of dth
in each bc4f <dig> population,  <dig> plants were grown in  <dig> and  <dig> in a paddy field at the national institute of agrobiological sciences  in tsukuba, japan . in each bc4f <dig> population,  <dig> and  <dig> plants were grown in  <dig> and  <dig> in the same paddy field at the nias. seeds were sown in april, and seedlings were transplanted to the paddy field in may . the mean day-lengths during the cultivation periods were  <dig>  h in april,  <dig>  h in may,  <dig>  h in june,  <dig>  h in july,  <dig>  h in august, and  <dig>  h in september. average temperatures during the cultivation periods were 17°c in may, 21°c in june, 24°c in july, 26°c in august, and 22°c in september. cultivation management followed the standard procedures used at nias. dth in the individual backcrossed plants were scored as the number of days from sowing to the appearance of the first panicle. for the parental accessions, dth were scored in  <dig> plants per line and mean values were calculated for each line.

the  <dig> parental accessions were grown in a controlled-environment cabinet under sd conditions  and ld conditions . the relative humidity was maintained at 60% under a photosynthetic photon flux density of 500 μmol m−2 s− <dig> provided by metal halide lamps that covered the spectrum from  <dig> to 1000 nm. dth in  <dig> plants of each accession were scored and mean values were calculated for each accession.

dna marker analysis
total genomic dna of individual backcrossed plants and parental accessions was extracted from 1–3 cm fresh leaves crushed in 250 μl extraction buffer containing 1 m kcl, 100 mm tris-hcl , and 10 mm edta. dna was precipitated with 100 μl 2-propanol, washed with 150 μl 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 30 μl buffer containing 1 mm tris-hcl ph <dig>  and  <dig>  mm edta, ph  <dig> . simple sequence repeats  were used as dna markers for linkage map construction and qtl detection. ssr markers were selected from those described by previous studies  <cit> . polymorphism detection procedures for the ssr markers have been described by  <cit> . gene-specific markers were used to determine precise genomic positions of  <dig> heading date genes, hd <dig>  hd <dig>  hd3a, ehd <dig>  ghd <dig>  dth <dig>  dth <dig>  dth <dig>  hd <dig>  hd <dig>  rft <dig>  osprr <dig>  and ehd <dig>  <cit> .

qtl analysis in advanced-backcross populations
for linkage mapping, version  <dig>  of mapmaker/exp  <cit>  was used. the kosambi mapping function was used to calculate genetic distances  <cit> . qtl analysis was performed using composite interval mapping as implemented by the zmapqtl program provided by version  <dig>  of the qtl cartographer software  <cit> . genome-wide threshold values  were used to detect qtls based on the results of  <dig>  permutations. lod thresholds from  <dig>  to  <dig>  were used in the qtl analyses of the bc4f <dig> populations.

sequencing of a heading date gene dth8
all exons of the dth <dig> gene were amplified with specific primers  <cit>  by pcr on genomic dna of the  <dig> rice accessions. amplified dna fragments were purified and sequenced with the sanger dideoxy terminator method  <cit> . to ensure that the sequence data were of high quality , re-sequencing was performed when necessary. each sequence read was individually mapped onto the nipponbare reference coding region sequence to ensure that all exons of dth <dig> were covered.

RESULTS
variation in heading date of asian rice accessions
dth of the  <dig> rice accessions varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>   under natural-day length  conditions . four rice accessions, hayamasari , qiu zhao zong , tupa 121- <dig> , and muha  had earlier heading than ksh. seven accessions, basilanon , deng pao zhai , khao mac kho , naba , bei khe , khao nam jen , and bleiyo , had later heading than ksh. ble and knj showed extremely late heading in comparison with ksh . under sd conditions, ble, ksh, and hay had relatively early heading, whereas kmk and bas had late heading . under ld conditions, hay and qzz had relatively early heading, whereas bas, knj, and ble had late heading. in ble, dth was > <dig> under ld conditions . dth of hay, qzz, and bas was similar under nd, sd, and ld conditions, indicating that these accessions are photoperiod-insensitive. dth of nab, knj, and ble was much lower under sd conditions than under ld conditions, indicating that these accessions are strongly photoperiod-sensitive.

variation in heading date in the bc4f <dig> populations
we developed bc4f <dig> populations in which particular heterozygous chromosome region of donor accessions segregated in the ksh genetic background . in each cross combination between ksh and the  <dig> donor accessions, ~ <dig> bc4f <dig> populations were developed . these bc4f <dig> populations covered the whole genomes of the  <dig> donor accessions. most plants in the bc4f <dig> populations and the recurrent parent ksh showed similar numbers of dth . however, several plants showed earlier or later heading than ksh, indicating that heading date qtls were segregating in the heterozygous chromosomal regions in these bc4f <dig> populations. bc4f <dig> plants with heading date earlier than that of ksh were observed in all cross combinations except knj/ksh and ble/ksh populations . bc4f <dig> plants with later heading than that of ksh were observed in all  <dig> cross combinations. no bc4f <dig> plants had similar heading date with hay, qzz, knj, or ble, i.e. the extremely early- or late-heading donor accessions.figure  <dig> frequency distributions of days to heading  under natural day-length conditions in bc4f <dig> populations. the  <dig> bc4f <dig> progenies were derived from crosses between koshihikari  and  <dig> diverse accessions of asian rice. abbreviations of rice accessions are defined in table  <dig>  x-axis indicates parental accessions and bc4f <dig> populations, y-axis indicates dth, and z-axis indicates the number of individual plants. bars indicate dth of ksh , of the other accessions  and of backcrossed populations . dth was defined as the number of days from sowing to the appearance of the first panicle of individual plants.



qtl detection in the bc4f <dig> populations
in the  <dig> bc4f <dig> populations, a total of  <dig> qtls were detected with the lod scores of > <dig>  . among them,  <dig> had a lod score of > <dig>  and  <dig> had a score of > <dig> . previously,  <dig> heading date qtls have been isolated and assigned to specific photoperiod flowering pathways in rice  <cit> . among the  <dig> newly detected qtls,  <dig> corresponded well to genomic positions of the  <dig> heading date genes . at the position of hd <dig> gene ,  <dig> qtls were detected. at the position of ghd <dig> gene ,  <dig> qtls were detected. at the position of dth <dig> gene ,  <dig> qtls were detected. near hd <dig>  rft <dig>  and hd3a genes ,  <dig> qtls were detected. near hd <dig> and hd <dig> genes ,  <dig> qtls were detected. near dth <dig> gene ,  <dig> qtls were detected. near ehd <dig> and dth <dig> genes ,  <dig> qtls were detected. near osprr <dig> gene ,  <dig> qtls were detected. and, near ehd <dig> gene ,  <dig> qtls were detected. almost all of these qtls corresponded well to those detected in f <dig> populations derived from the same cross combinations in the previous study  <cit> .figure  <dig> chromosomal locations of qtls for days to heading  under natural day-length conditions detected in bc4f <dig> populations. qtls were detected in  <dig> bc4f <dig> populations derived from crosses between koshihikari  and  <dig> diverse accessions of asian rice. consensus linkage maps of  <dig> rice chromosomes are depicted as ladder-structured boxes; approximate locations of  <dig> heading date genes isolated previously are shown. qtl positions are oriented from hayamasari   to bleiyo   in the same order as in table  <dig>  vertical bars indicate confidence intervals of qtls  and show peak lod scores of  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>  , and > <dig>  . horizontal thick bars on the qtl intervals indicate those confirmed in  <dig> bc4f <dig> populations.



the remaining  <dig> of the  <dig> qtls were found in genomic regions different from those of the  <dig> isolated genes . lod scores > <dig>  were detected for  <dig> qtls and lod scores > <dig>  were detected for  <dig> qtls. these qtls were distributed over all  <dig> chromosomes. qtl clusters were found in several chromosomal regions, such as the proximal region of the short arm on chromosome  <dig>  distal end of the long arm on chromosome  <dig>  and centromeric region of chromosome  <dig> . our results indicate that, in addition to the alleles of the previously isolated genes, a number of qtls contribute to phenotypic variation in heading date of asian rice accessions.

among the  <dig> qtls, the values of significant additive effects of the ksh alleles ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  days  in comparison with the donor parent alleles. in  <dig> qtls , the ksh alleles showed earliness additive effects, whereas in  <dig> qtls , the ksh alleles showed lateness additive effects. in  <dig> qtls , additive effects of ksh alleles of <3 days were observed, whereas in  <dig> qtls  these effects were >3 days. we detected similar numbers of qtls showing small or large additive effects in this study. the  <dig> qtls located near the  <dig> genes isolated previously had relatively large additive effects, whereas the other  <dig> qtls had relatively small additive effects .figure  <dig> the number of qtls and their additive effects detected in bc4f <dig> populations. the  <dig> bc4f <dig> progenies were derived from crosses between koshihikari  and  <dig> diverse accessions of asian rice. orange bars indicate ksh alleles of the qtls contributing to later flowering in comparison with alleles of other accessions, whereas blue bars indicate ksh alleles of the qtls contributing to earlier flowering in comparison with alleles of other accessions.



the cummulative additive effects of qtls detected in  <dig> accessions and their dth under nd conditions showed a significant correlation . total additive effects of all qtls reliably predicted the order of heading dates of the  <dig> donor accessions. hay and qzz were predicted to have early heading dates, whereas knj and ble were predicted to have late heading. the predicted heading dates had the same order as the actual heading dates under nd condition in the  <dig> rice accessions. however, the predicted heading dates deviated from actual heading dates under nd conditions in extremely-early and extremely-late heading accessions. actual heading dates of hay and qzz were  <dig>  and  <dig>  days earlier, respectively, than that of ksh under nd conditions , whereas predicted heading dates of hay and qzz were only  <dig>  and  <dig>  days earlier. actual heading dates of knj and ble were  <dig>  and  <dig>  days later, respectively, than that of ksh under nd conditions , whereas predicted heading dates were  <dig>  and  <dig>  days later.figure  <dig> relationship between actual days to heading  and predicted dth estimated from additive effects of each qtl. actual dth were scored under natural-day length  condition. predicted dth were estimated from the sum of additive effects of each qtl detected in all  <dig> bc4f <dig> populations derived from ksh and  <dig> diverse accessions of asian rice.



confirmation of qtls in the bc4f <dig> populations
in small-sized populations, it may be difficult to detect reliable qtls because of the possibility of false positive detection  <cit> . to confirm the genetic effects of the qtls detected in the bc4f <dig> populations, we selected  <dig> qtls that included both large- and small-effect qtls distributed across the rice genome. we developed and analyzed  <dig> bc4f <dig> populations consisting of > <dig>  backcrossed individual plants . in these bc4f <dig> populations, we confirmed the presence of all  <dig> qtls detected in the bc4f <dig> populations .table  <dig> heading date qtls confirmed in bc4f <dig> populations

among small-effect qtls, we focused on seven qtls chosen on the basis of the size of additive effect and genomic position : these qtls had additive effects of <3 days and their locations were different from those of heading date genes isolated previously. in qzz/ksh, the additive effects of the ksh alleles of the qtl on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> were  <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> population and  <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> population. in tup/ksh, the additive effects of the ksh alleles of the two qtls on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> were  <dig>  and − <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> populations and  <dig>  and − <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> populations. in dpz/ksh, the additive effects of the ksh alleles of the qtl on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> were − <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> population and − <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> population. in tup/ksh, the additive effects of the ksh alleles of the qtl on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> were − <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> population and − <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> population. in knj/ksh, the additive effects of the ksh alleles of the other qtl on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> were − <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> population and − <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> population. in kmk/ksh, the additive effects of the ksh alleles of the two qtls on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> were − <dig>  days and − <dig>  days in the two bc4f <dig> populations, and − <dig>  days in the bc4f <dig> populations. using the bc4f <dig> populations, we even confirmed the existence of small-effect qtls with additive effects of <3 days.figure  <dig> confirmation of the allelic differences at seven qtls using bc4f <dig> populations. in each panel, graphical representation of the genotype of a bc4f <dig> plant is shown in the upper part and frequency distribution of days to heading  in seven bc4f <dig> populations is shown in the lower part. in ksh/qzz , ksh/tup , ksh/dpz , ksh/tup , ksh/knj  and ksh/kmk  populations. in genotypes, vertical bars indicate genotypes of rice chromosomes from  <dig>  to  <dig> . bars indicate genotypes heterozygous in blue, and homozygous for ksh alleles in white. qtl positions detected in bc4f <dig> and bc4f <dig> populations are depicted as red horizontal lines. in the lower part of each panel, bars correspond to the nearest molecular markers homozygous for ksh allele , heterozygous , and homozygous for the allele from another accession .



for the same seven qtls, we tried to delimit their chromosomal regions by substitution mapping in the bc4f <dig> populations, even though only a small number of bc4f <dig> progenies had recombination within the qtl regions . in the qzz/ksh population, the qtl on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> was located within ~ <dig>  mbp of the marker interval from the distal end of the arm to rm <dig>  in the tup/ksh population, the two qtls on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> were located within ~ <dig>  mbp of the interval from the distal end of the arm to rm <dig> and within ~ <dig>  mbp of the rm7562–rm <dig> interval. in the dpz/ksh population, the qtl on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> was located within ~ <dig>  mbp of the interval from the distal end of the arm to rm <dig>  on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  the two qtls were narrowed down to within ~ <dig>  mbp of the interval from the distal end of the arm to rm <dig> in the tup/ksh population, and within ~ <dig>  mbp of the interval from the distal end of the arm to rm <dig> in the knj/ksh population. in the kmk/ksh population, the qtl on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> was located within ~ <dig>  mbp of the interval from the distal end of the arm to rm <dig>  our results clearly delimit significant marker intervals that include small-effect qtls using advanced-backcross progenies.figure  <dig> fine mapping of seven qtls for days to heading  under natural day-length conditions in bc4f <dig> populations. bc4f <dig> progenies were derived from crosses between koshihikari  and other accessions of asian rice . values are means ± standard deviation. abbreviations of rice accessions are defined in table  <dig>  positions of molecular markers are indicated according to irgsp  <dig>  of the rice genome sequence  <cit> . red bars indicate marker intervals delimited for each qtl position.



discussion
many genetic studies have focused on cloning genes or qtls for heading date in rice, and a detailed genetic control pathway has been revealed  <cit> . in most cases, qtls with large effects have been studied as targets for genetic analysis and molecular characterization. the role of qtls with small-effects in heading date variation among rice accessions still remains unclear.

we demonstrated the potential utility of advanced-backcross populations in genetic analysis of natural variation in heading date, in particular, detection of small-effect qtls. we found that  <dig> qtls  had additive effects of <3 days. most of these qtls were found in different chromosomal regions than the previously isolated genes. previous study  <cit>  detected heading date qtls in the f <dig> populations  and advanced-backcross populations  derived from crosses between ksh and the indica accession nona bokra. the qtls detected in the advanced-backcross populations showed smaller additive effects than the qtls detected in the f <dig> populations. therefore, the results of the previous and current studies clearly indicate that advanced-backcross populations are more efficient for detection of small-effect qtls than the f <dig> populations.

small-effect qtls often show inconsistent additive effects across different genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. however, in this study, a number of small effect qtls were consistently detected both in the bc4f <dig> and bc4f <dig> populations. in the  <dig> bc4f <dig> populations, qtls with lod > <dig>  , including those with lod > <dig>   and > <dig>   were detected. among the  <dig> qtls, we selected  <dig> qtls and confirmed their presence in the bc4f <dig> populations. these results also indicate that advanced-backcross populations are suitable for detection of small-effect qtls even in small-sized bc4f <dig> populations used in this study.

the advanced-backcross populations are also suitable to delimit the positions of individual small-effect qtls. for example, in the tup/ksh populations, two qtls with opposite genetic effects were detected in a very narrow region on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  however, these qtls are independent of each other because of the opposite additive effects of ksh alleles. one qtl was localized closer to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> than the other qtl, which was located within the marker interval from rm <dig> to rm <dig>  in kmk/ksh populations, one qtl was detected in the region from the distal end to rm <dig>  on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  this qtl was located close to dth <dig> gene. however, dth <dig> gene is located at  <dig>  mbp from the distal end of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  and kmk and ksh share the same allele of dth <dig> gene . therefore, this qtl and dth <dig> gene are clearly distinct from each other. these examples clearly demonstrate that substitution mapping using advanced-backcross populations is effective for dissecting two independent qtls located closely to each other.

previous qtl studies of heading date have identified several small-effect qtls . these small-effect qtls remain poorly characterized and further genetic analyses such as gene cloning and functional characterization are necessary to understand the whole genetic architecture controlling heading date in rice. however, map-based cloning of small-effect qtls is sometimes difficult because of small phenotypic differences between the qtl alleles. reverse genetic approaches can be applied to solve this problem. recently, using next-generation sequencing technology, whole genomic sequences of many accessions have been obtained. sequence comparison of a particular qtl region among rice accessions is a practical way to nominate probable candidate genes with functional polymorphisms, such as single amino acid substitutions and in-frame deletions or insertions. we can also nominate target genes of interest according to estimation of the gene function based on gene annotation information from rice annotation project database  and comprehensive gene expression profiles of microarray analysis from rice expression profile database . once a candidate gene is nominated, we should develop transgenic plants including over-expression lines and rnai lines can be developed. we can also find lines with disrupted target genes in large sets of mutants with insertions of tos <dig>  <cit>  and t-dna  <cit> . recently developed tilling technique allows direct identification of mutation sites within a specific gene  <cit> . the tilling technique could provide a powerful strategy to obtain lines with target genes disrupted in mutants generated by irradiation or chemical treatment. the approaches described above can be applied to identify genes for heading date qtls with quite small effects, such as those detected in this study. to date, in addition to  <dig> genes isolated by map-based cloning strategies,  <dig> genes have been identified as flowering-time–related genes by genetic analysis of rice mutants and transgenic lines . in this study, some small-effect qtls were located near the genes reported in previous studies. spontaneous mutations in these genes might cause functional polymorphisms of these qtls. sequencing analyses of these genes and adjacent regions may reveal the genes responsible for heading date differences among asian rice accessions.

in this study, the chromosomal positions of several large-effect qtls corresponded to the positions of hd <dig>  hd3a/rft <dig>  hd <dig>  ghd <dig>  osprr <dig>  and dth <dig>  sequence polymorphisms in the isolated genes have been detected in the  <dig> accessions used in this study  . sequence polymorphisms in the isolated genes were consistent with locations of the qtls in this study. for example, in the hay/ksh and qzz/ksh populations, qtls were found in the same genomic regions as hd <dig>  ghd <dig>  osprr <dig>  and dth <dig>  hay and qzz had alleles of these genes different from that of ksh. in comparison with ksh, hay had a strong functional allele of hd <dig>  whereas qzz had a non-functional allele of hd <dig>  hay and qzz have non-functional alleles of ghd <dig>  osprr <dig>  and dth <dig>  the japonica cultivars harboring non-functional alleles of both ghd <dig> and osprr <dig> flower extremely early under nd conditions, and are adapted to the northernmost regions  of rice cultivation areas in china, korea, and japan  <cit> . we also investigated functional nucleotide polymorphisms in ehd <dig>  hd <dig>  hd <dig>  dth <dig>  ehd <dig>  and ehd <dig> . in the hay/ksh and qzz/ksh populations, additional qtls were detected in the hd6/hd <dig>  ehd4/dth <dig>  and hd17/rft1/hd3a regions. because hay and ksh have the same allele of hd <dig> and different alleles of hd <dig>  the qtl near hd <dig> and hd <dig> would be due to difference between hay  and ksh . qzz and ksh have different alleles of hd <dig> and hd <dig>  but the same alleles of ehd <dig>  dth <dig>  hd <dig>  rft <dig> and hd3a. therefore, the qtls near hd <dig> and hd <dig> would be due to allelic differences in these genes, but the qtls near ehd <dig>  dth <dig>  hd <dig>  rft <dig>  and hd3a are probably due to unidentified genes. these results suggest that heading date variations in rice accessions are due to combinations of different alleles of previously isolated and unidentified heading date genes.

based on the results in this study, we estimated the relationship between the degree of photoperiod sensitivity and the gene pathway regulating heading date in representative accessions . as qzz is photoperiod-insensitive due to non-functional alleles of hd <dig>  ghd <dig>  and dth <dig>  hd3a and rft <dig> are transcriptionally up-regulated even under ld conditions. tup shows weak photoperiod sensitivity due to a non-functional allele of hd <dig>  but the functional allele of dth <dig> would transcriptionally down-regulate ehd <dig> and rft1; as a result, tup shows a later heading date than qzz under ld conditions. bkh shows weak photoperiod sensitivity mainly due to non-functional alleles of dth <dig> and rft <dig>  the latter fails to induce heading under ld conditions; as a result, bkh shows a later heading date than qzz. knj has functional alleles of almost all heading date genes and therefore shows strong photoperiod sensitivity. in ble, extremely late heading date  under ld conditions was due to a non-functional allele of rft <dig>  thus, different allele combinations of the heading date genes in rice accessions can explain the degree of photoperiod sensitivity and heading date variation under various day-length conditions.figure  <dig> a model of genetic control of responses to day length in different asian rice. six genes were included in the model for five representative asian rice accessions. abbreviations of rice accessions are defined in table  <dig>   days to heading  were scored under short-day length  and long-day length  conditions. sd conditions were 10 h light/14 h dark; ld conditions were  <dig>  h light/ <dig>  h dark. values are means ± standard deviation .  genetic regulatory pathways under ld conditions. functional alleles are shown in blue and non-functional alleles are shown in red.



our results suggest that the genetic architecture of heading date in rice is a combination of large-effect qtls and small-effect qtls. the sum of additive effects of each qtl reliably estimated the heading date of individual donor accessions , although the prediction deviated from the actual heading date in several accessions. previous studies have reported a complex regulation system that includes epistatic interactions among genes and qtls for heading date of rice  <cit> . consideration of epistatic interactions could more accurately predict heading date of each rice accession on the basis of allelic combinations among a number of genes and qtls. the complete genetic architecture of heading date would enable precise understanding of differences in heading dates of rice accessions and help to develop new rice accessions.

genome-wide genetic studies have revealed the divergence of the genetic architecture of flowering time or heading date control in arabidopsis, maize, sorghum and barley  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the genetic basis of flowering time variation is shaped by a small number of genes with large effects such as transcription factor genes frigida  and flowering locus c  that act in the vernalization-responsive pathway  <cit> . the authors found that most heading date qtls cluster in as few as five genomic regions, which include fri and flc. these results were obtained using 17 f <dig> populations derived from crosses among  <dig> distinct accessions representing much of the common genetic diversity of arabidopsis. in barley,  <dig> double haploid populations reveal a set of qtls, such as photoperiod-h <dig> , ppd-h <dig>  vernalization-h <dig> , vrn-h <dig> and early maturity  <dig>  accounted for an important percentage of the heading date variation  <cit> . it is suggesting that the genetic architectures of heading date are similar between arabidopsis and barley. in maize, large-scale genetic analysis of > <dig>  recombinant inbred lines from crosses among  <dig> diverse inbred lines indicated that heading date is controlled by the additive effect of many qtls with small effects  <cit> . in sorghum,  <dig> populations of recombinant inbred lines of > <dig>  individuals revealed that a relatively large number of qtls with small effects control heading date, and 75% of detected qtls were localized in the same chromosomal regions as in maize  <cit> . large-effect qtls have been also reported in sorghum; for example, ma <dig> is a major photoperiod sensitivity locus with an additive effect of  <dig>  days  <cit> . therefore, the genetic architecture of heading date in sorghum is similar to that in rice.

a comparison of the genetic architecture of flowering time or heading date among arabidopsis, barley, maize, and rice should consider three major points. first, even though the cues involved in genetic control of flowering  and heading , such as temperature and day length, are different, the genetic control is similar; a combination of loss- or gain-of-function alleles of major genes is responsible for large variation in flowering time and heading date. second, difference in the regulatory mechanisms between rice and arabidopsis  might be due to difference in cultivation areas and reproduction methods of these species. arabidopsis and barley grow at higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere than rice and maize, and some arabidopsis and barley accessions require vernalization to avoid flowering during prolonged cold conditions in winter  <cit> . therefore, allelic differences between vernalization-related genes, such as fri and flc in arabidopsis, and vrn-h <dig> and vrn-h <dig> in barley, might contribute considerably to natural variation of flowering time and heading date. third, the genetic architecture is different in rice and maize and regulation by large-effect qtls has not been detected in maize. maize was domesticated in tropical areas at low latitudes and cultivation was expanded to higher-latitude areas during selection by humans  <cit> . rice domestication was similar to that of maize  <cit> . however, maize is an out-crossing species, whereas rice is a self-pollinating species. therefore, in maize, heading date of individual plants must be substantially synchronous within a local population to ensure mating success  <cit>  and selection in maize breeding may have favored accumulation of many small-effect qtls to ensure adaptation to different environmental conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
our results enhance understanding of the genetic architecture of heading date in rice. comparisons of results between the previous and our studies suggested that genetic architecture in rice were different from those in arabidopsis, maize, barley and sorghum. in rice, small-effect qtls largely contributed to a wide range of natural variations of heading date, in addition to large-effect qtls including  <dig> genes isolated previously. both large- and small-effect qtls could be of great significance in rice breeding for fine-tuning of heading date, which is needed for adaption to certain environmental conditions  and to expand rice growing areas to high-latitude regions.
