BACKGROUND
nfat5/tonebp belongs to the rel family of transcription factors, which also comprises nf-κb and the calcineurin-dependent nfatc proteins   <cit> . rel proteins have in common a conserved dna binding domain, but do not display recognizable similarities outside of it. the dna binding domain of nfat <dig> is considered a hybrid between that of nf-κb and nfatc proteins, since it is a constitutive dimer, structurally similar to nf-κb, but has nfatc-like dna sequence specificity, with its optimal binding site being a 5'-tggaaaa-3' motif, in which the nfatc cognate element is 5'-ggaa-3'  <cit> . nfatc and nfat <dig> differ substantially in their mechanisms of activation and biological function. nfatc proteins are characteristically activated by the phosphatase calcineurin in response to increases in intracellular calcium concentration  <cit> , whereas nfat <dig> is activated by hypertonicity  <cit> . activation of nfat <dig> is regulated by different kinases, such as the stress-activated kinase p <dig>  fyn  <cit> , pka  <cit> , erk  <cit> , the pi3-kinase-related kinase  atm  <cit> , and phosphoinositide 3-kinase   <cit> . p <dig> has been shown to regulate nfat <dig> in some cell types but not in others  <cit> . nfatc proteins play fundamental roles in the immune, nervous and cardiovascular systems . nfat <dig> allows mammalian cells to adapt to hypertonicity  <cit> , by inducing the expression of osmoprotective proteins, such as aldose reductase , na+/cl--coupled betaine/γ-aminobutyric acid transporter , na+-dependent myo-inositol transporter , na+ and cl--dependent taurine transporter , ut-a urea transporter, and hsp <dig> . nfat5-deficient mice suffer severe atrophy of the renal medulla, a naturally hypertonic environment, and impaired lymphocyte function  <cit> .

the osmoresponsive function of nfat <dig> has been documented in diverse cell types, such as lymphocytes  <cit> , embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> , kidney cells  <cit> , neurons  <cit> , and cell lines of different lineages  <cit> . however, little is known about tonicity thresholds  at which nfat <dig> is activated in specific types of primary cells. in this regard, a transgenic mouse model with an integrated nfat5-responsive reporter would facilitate the analysis of its transcriptional regulation in primary cells and tissues. an nfat-luciferase  transgenic mouse carrying  <dig> copies of an nfat site  positioned 5' to the minimal promoter of the α-myosin heavy chain gene was developed by wilkins et al., who studied the role of the calcineurin-nfatc pathway in cardiac hypertrophy  <cit> . as described in the original article, luciferase activity was detectable in most organs and was highest in the brain, kidney and heart, indicating that the reporter was functional in different types of tissues. since the nfat site used in the reporter construct almost coincided with an optimal binding site for nfat <dig> , we wondered whether it could be activated by this factor.

in this work we show that the 9xnfat-luc reporter is activated by nfat <dig> in response to hypertonicity in transgenic primary t lymphocytes, macrophages and mouse embryo fibroblasts , and by nfatc proteins in response to calcineurin activation. activation of nfat <dig> in lymphocytes was detected in response to hypertonicity levels in the range measured in plasma in patients and animal models with osmoregulatory disorders. activation of nfat <dig> transcriptional activity by hypertonicity was substantially downregulated by the p <dig> inhibitors sb <dig> and sb <dig>  and by inhibition of pikk with  <dig> μm ly <dig>  the reporter was partially sensitive to the calcineurin inhibitor fk <dig>  the pi3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin , and the protein kinase a inhibitor h <dig>  but was not inhibited by the erk inhibitor pd <dig>  these results, together with others in the literature, suggest that activation of nfat <dig> by hypertonicity involves different combinations of signaling pathways in different cell types. our results indicate that 9xnfat-luc mice might constitute a useful tool to study the regulation of both nfat <dig> and nfatc proteins and the effect of pharmacological modulators in different types of primary cells.

RESULTS
activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter by nfat <dig> or nfatc proteins in a stimulus-specific manner
we observed that the 9xnfat-luc reporter was comparably activated by hypertonicity or pma plus ionomycin  in the human t lymphocyte cell line jurkat . activation by p+i was suppressed by the calcineurin inhibitor fk <dig>  whereas induction by hypertonicity was not. hypertonicity-induced activation was downregulated by > 60% in cells transfected with the isolated dimerization domain of nfat <dig> , which inhibits nfat <dig> but not nfatc proteins  <cit> , whereas activation by p+i was not significantly inhibited . the vivit peptide, which disrupts the binding of calcineurin to nfatc proteins  <cit> , prevented the activation of the reporter by p+i without affecting its induction by hypertonicity . the 9xnfat-luc reporter was activated by hypertonicity levels between  <dig> to  <dig> mosm/kg, comparably to a widely used nfat5-dependent reporter driven by the enhancer of the aldose reductase gene  <cit>  . these results indicated that the 9xnfat-luc reporter could be activated by distinct types of stimuli: hypertonicity via nfat <dig>  and pma plus ionomycin via the calcineurin-dependent nfatc proteins.

in order to conclusively confirm that the 9xnfat-luc reporter was activated by nfat <dig> under hypertonic conditions, we bred nfat5+/- mice  <cit>  into the 9xnfat-luc transgenic background to obtain 9xnfat-luc+/nfat5-/- mice. we derived mouse embryo fibroblasts , and also analyzed mature t cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages from several independent nfat5-/- adult mice. as shown in figure 2a, hypertonicity activated the 9xnfat-luc reporter in nfat5+/+ mef, but not in nfat5-/- cells. both cell types showed a comparable response to p+i, which was suppressed by fk <dig>  activation of the reporter by hypertonicity in nfat5+/+ mef was partially inhibited  by fk <dig>  transfection of an nfat <dig> expression vector in nfat5-/- mef reconstituted their responsiveness to hypertonicity . results obtained with 9xnfat-luc transgenic t cells derived from nfat5+/+ and nfat5-/- mice confirmed that activation of the reporter by hypertonicity was severely impaired in nfat5-/- cells, whereas activation by p+i was independent of nfat <dig> . hypertonicity-induced activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter was variably inhibited by fk <dig> in t lymphocytes. we also noticed that hypertonicity induced a weak activation of the reporter in nfat5-/- cells, which was also partially inhibited by fk <dig>  it has been recently shown that nfatc <dig> can be activated by hypertonicity  <cit> , and thus it is possible that the residual activity induced by hypertonic stimulation in nfat5-/- t cells could be due to nfatc proteins. nonetheless, our overall results in primary t lymphocytes, macrophages , mef and jurkat t cells showed that activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter by hypertonicity was predominantly attributable to nfat <dig>  while other factors made a much lesser contribution to this stimulus. on the other hand, we did not observe significant contribution of nfat <dig> to the activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter by p+i.

luciferase activity was measured in proliferating transgenic 9xnfat-luc t cells derived from littermate nfat5+/+ and nfat5-/- mice after stimulation with hypertonic medium or pma plus ionomycin, in the absence or presence of  <dig> nm fk <dig>  luciferase activity is represented as relative light units per second  after normalization with endogenous lactate dehydrogenase.

hypertonicity threshold for nfat <dig> activation
studies on hypertonic stress responses in different types of mammalian cells usually utilize hypertonicity levels of  <dig> mosm/kg or higher, although it is poorly understood where cells might be exposed to such elevated hypertonicity levels besides the renal medulla. physiologic osmolality values in plasma, brain and lung in mice are close to  <dig> mosm/kg, and between 330– <dig> mosm/kg in thymus, spleen and liver  <cit> . in humans, normal plasma osmolality is ~ <dig> mosm/kg, but can rise to the range of  <dig> to  <dig> mosm/kg in cases of severe hypernatremia  <cit> , salt poisoning in infants  <cit> , adipsic disorders with impairment of thirst perception  <cit> , and renal pathologies  <cit> . constitutively elevated plasma tonicity  has been reported in mice deficient in v <dig> vasopressin receptor  <cit> , and in mice with congenital progressive hydronephrosis caused by a mutation in aquaporin- <dig>  <cit> . in aquaporin-1-deficient mice, plasma tonicity can reach  <dig> mosm/kg after  <dig> hours of water deprivation, despite which these can survive if water is administered to them again  <cit> . elevation of the tonicity in plasma would expose different tissues to hypertonic stress and might activate nfat <dig>  as shown in rats where an acute rise of plasma osmolality to  <dig> mosm/kg triggered a rapid increase in expression and nuclear accumulation of nfat <dig> in neurons  <cit> .

titration of the responsiveness of the 9xnfat-luc reporter to hypertonicity in the t cell line jurkat showed that the reporter was significantly activated by hypertonicity levels of ≥  <dig> mosm/kg . proliferating t cells derived from splenocytes stimulated during  <dig> days with the mitogen concanavalin a  plus il <dig> showed calcineurin-independent activation of the reporter at  <dig> mosm/kg . in the same type of cells, induction of nfat <dig> expression was detected at lower tonicity values  than the activation of the reporter. in these experiments, stimulation with hypertonicity was done in the presence of the calcineurin inhibitor fk <dig> to prevent any potential contribution of nfatc proteins. when we measured the activity of the reporter in freshly isolated thymocytes and splenocytes, we detected its activation only in response to p+i, but not with hypertonicity . these results suggested that optimal nfat5-mediated activation of the transgenic reporter in lymphocytes depended on their activation state. in agreement with this, we found that a 24-hour stimulation of t cells with mitogens conferred them the ability to respond to hypertonicity levels of  <dig> mosm/kg . next, we analyzed whether the responsiveness of the reporter varied at different time points after t cells had been stimulated with mitogens. as shown in figure 4a and table  <dig>  the response to hypertonicity was strongest when cells had been stimulated with mitogens for one day. in these cells, activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter was robustly induced at  <dig> and  <dig> mosm/kg, and was even detectable at  <dig> mosm/kg in some of the experiments. the intensity of the response became weaker in t cells that had been cultured during  <dig> hours or longer . we also found that lymphocytes showed a lower hypertonicity threshold for nfat <dig> activation than bone marrow-derived macrophages and mef. as shown in figure 4b, nfat5-dependent activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter in macrophages was observed at  <dig> mosm/kg. it was noticeable that hypertonicity-induced activation of this reporter was insensitive to fk <dig> in macrophages. activation of the reporter in mef required a higher hypertonicity threshold  .

transgenic 9xnfat-luc splenocytes were activated with concanavalin a plus il <dig> during  <dig> to  <dig> hours in isotonic medium, and then exposed to hypertonicity, or stimulated with pma plus ionomycin for  <dig> hours. luciferase activity is represented as relative light units per second  after normalization with endogenous lactate dehydrogenase.

sensitivity of nfat <dig> transcriptional activity to pharmacological inhibitors
nfat <dig> is fundamental in the adaptation of mammalian cells to osmotic stress, and the regulation of its transcriptional function by signaling pathways in primary, non-transformed cells, has not been fully elucidated. we analyzed the transcriptional response to hypertonicity in t cells treated with inhibitors of signaling pathways that had been reported to regulate nfat <dig> in other cell types. as shown in figure 5a, activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter was downregulated by the p <dig> inhibitors sb <dig> and sb <dig> , and by inhibition of pikk with  <dig> μm ly <dig>  the reporter was insensitive to the erk inhibitor pd <dig> , and partially inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitor fk <dig> , the pi3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin  and ly <dig> , and the protein kinase a inhibitor h <dig> . in the same type of experiment,  <dig> μm ly <dig> also caused a mild inhibition of nfat <dig> expression . the jnk inhibitor sp <dig>  yielded inconsistent results, and we only observed a 30% inhibition of the reporter in one of three independent experiments .

experiments in mef showed that activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter was also prevented by sb <dig> and ly <dig> . in these cells, sb <dig> partially reduced the accumulation of nfat <dig> in response to hypertonicity, while  <dig> μm ly <dig> caused a substantial inhibition of nfat <dig> expression. these results revealed that ly294002-sensitive kinases regulated both the transcriptional activation of nfat <dig> and its expression in response to hypertonicity in different cell types.

discussion
we show that the 9xnfat-luc reporter integrated in transgenic cells is activated by endogenous nfat <dig> in response to hypertonicity and by nfatc proteins in response to calcineurin activation. a previous report had shown that a chimeric reporter with nfat <dig> sites inserted into the minimal il <dig> promoter could be activated by nfat <dig> in response to hypertonicity as well as pma plus ionomycin in jurkat t cells  <cit> , suggesting that this factor might regulate certain promoters in response to non-hypertonic stimuli. our results in primary mouse lymphocytes, macrophages, mef and jurkat cells show a remarkable selectivity in the activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter by nfat <dig> in response to hypertonicity, and by nfatc proteins in response to pma plus ionomycin. these experiments indicate that the specific recruitment of either nfatc or nfat <dig> to dna sites to which both factors can bind may be determined by the type of stimulus. this finding is in line with work by the goldfeld laboratory, who showed that some sites in the tnfα promoter and the ltr of hiv could recruit both nfat <dig> and nfatc  <cit> , and that occupancy of the site by either type of transcription factor depended on the stimulus. hypertonicity-mediated activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter was variably inhibited by fk <dig> in primary t cells and mef, although not in macrophages and jurkat cells, suggesting that calcineurin can modulate the hypertonic stress response in some cell types. this observation is consistent with a recent report showing that calcineurin was a positive regulator of both nfatc <dig> and nfat <dig> in the activation of the aquaporin  <dig> promoter by hypertonicity in murine collecting duct cells  <cit> . altogether, results from previous work  <cit> , and ours here indicate that calcineurin might enhance the activation of nfat <dig> by hypertonicity in some cell types, although it is not generally essential for its function, in contrast to the strict requirement of this phosphatase in the activation of nfatc proteins.

the variable dependence of nfat <dig> transcriptional activity on calcineurin in different cell types would need to be considered when using the 9xnfat-luc mice to study the activation of nfat <dig> and nfatc proteins in vivo or in primary cultures from different organs. the use of calcineurin inhibitors in cell culture experiments, and parallel analysis of nfat5-deficient cells, as we have shown here, would ensure that the measured reporter activity is derived from nfat <dig> rather from nfatc. in vivo, however, calcineurin inhibitors might complicate the interpretation of results due to side effects such as nephrotoxicity, which might affect sodium and water homeostasis in the organism  <cit>  and indirectly perturb the regulation of nfat <dig> and nfatc proteins. crosses between 9xnfat-luc mice and tissue-specific conditional knockout for calcineurin or nfat proteins might prove useful to study these factors in vivo.

our experiments, together with independent results from the literature, revealed some heterogeneity in the sensitivity of nfat <dig> transcriptional activity to pharmacological inhibitors. hypertonicity-induced activation of nfat <dig> in t lymphocytes was substantially downregulated by the pi3-kinase and pikk inhibitors wortmannin and ly <dig>  this result agreed with previous reports using jurkat t cells and hek <dig> cells  <cit> . we also found that inhibition of pikk impaired the upregulation of nfat <dig> expression by hypertonicity in non-transformed lymphocytes and mef. atm and other pikk regulate the nuclear translocation of nfat <dig>  <cit> , but their involvement in upregulating nfat <dig> expression had not been previously documented. these observations indicate that pikk regulate different layers of nfat <dig> function.

with regard to other pathways, we found that activation of nfat <dig> was inhibited by two independent p <dig> inhibitors, sb <dig> and sb <dig>  reports indicate that p <dig> might not be a universal regulator of nfat <dig>  since kultz et al., showed that a dominant negative construct of mkk <dig> failed to inhibit the nfat5-dependent reporter ore-luc in pap-ht <dig> rabbit renal medullary cells  <cit> , whereas ko et al., showed that both a dominant negative p <dig> construct and sb <dig> effectively inhibited the same reporter in nih3t <dig> and mef  <cit> . tsai et al., found that a dominant negative p <dig> also inhibited the nfat5-regulated taut and hsp <dig> promoters in nucleus pulposus cells  <cit> . the same report also showed that a dominant negative erk construct and the erk inhibitor pd <dig> partially inhibited nfat <dig>  whereas we found that activation of nfat <dig> in primary mouse t cells was insensitive to pd <dig>  h <dig> had been reported to partially inhibit nfat <dig> transcriptional activity in the hepg <dig> hepatocellular carcinoma cell line  <cit> , and we obtained similar results in t cells. the jnk inhibitor sp <dig> did not impair the activation of the 9xnfat-luc reporter in t cells , in agreement with previous reports showing that neither sp <dig>  <cit>  nor inhibition of jnk with a dominant negative sek <dig> construct  <cit>  inhibited nfat <dig> in other cell types. we interpret our results with inhibitors cautiously, as some might inhibit more than one single kinase . nonetheless, our profiling of the sensitivity of nfat <dig> to pharmacological inhibitors in t cells, together with previous reports, supports the notion that activation of nfat <dig> by hypertonicity involves distinct combinations of regulators in different cell types. unravelling the identity of kinases and properties of nfat5-regulatory pathways in specific cell types would help to understand the relevance of osmotic stress responses in mammals.

while it is clear that the osmoprotective function of nfat <dig> is critical in the renal medulla, a physiologically hypertonic environment  <cit> , many other cell types can also express and activate this factor when exposed to hypertonic stress. however, its activation threshold under physiological or pathological tonicity conditions in different cell types is largely unknown. our experiments show that activated t lymphocytes are sensitive to moderate increases in extracellular tonicity, and could induce nfat <dig> expression at relatively low levels of hypertonicity , and detectable transcriptional activity of this factor at 360– <dig> mosm/kg, which increased sharply at  <dig> mosm/kg. tonicity levels in the 360– <dig> mosm/kg range have been recorded in the plasma of patients with osmoregulatory disorders and in aquaporin and vasopressin receptor-deficient mice  <cit> . the hypertonicity level required to stimulate the 9xnfat-luc reporter in lymphocytes varied with their activation state. the reporter did not respond to hypertonicity in resting lymphocytes, showed a robust response to  <dig> and  <dig> mosm/kg in t cells that had been exposed to mitogens for  <dig> hours, and became less responsive in cells cultured during  <dig> to  <dig> hours. t cell activation by mitogens or antigen receptor causes a dramatic increase in biogenesis, cell growth and gene expression during the first 24– <dig> hours, that precedes the entry of the lymphocyte in a series of cell division rounds  <cit> . that t cells display a greater sensitivity to hypertonicity and a stronger nfat <dig> transcriptional response in the first stages of their activation is likely relevant to ensure their function under potentially harmful osmotic stress conditions. in this regard, exposure of fresh nfat5-deficient t cells to  <dig> mosm/kg during the first  <dig> days of antigen receptor-induced activation reduced their proliferation rate by more than 60%, whereas normal lymphocytes were not affected  <cit> . altogether, these observations indicate that pathologic elevations of the extracellular tonicity rapidly activate the expression and transcriptional activation of nfat <dig> in lymphocytes to ensure an appropriate osmoprotective response.

activation of the reporter in macrophages and mef required higher tonicity levels than in lymphocytes. it is intriguing that diverse cell types appear to require different hypertonicity levels to activate nfat5-mediated transcriptional responses. while lymphocytes, as shown here and by go et al.  <cit> , and possibly neurons  <cit>  and macrophages can respond to hypertonicity levels that may occur in certain pathologic conditions, other cells such as fibroblasts require a hypertonicity threshold that is unlikely to be found out of the renal medulla. investigating the gene expression programs regulated by increasing levels of hypertonicity in different cell types might provide clues about the biological relevance of this response.

CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that the 9xnfat-luc reporter can be selectively activated by nfat <dig> or nfatc proteins in a stimulus-specific manner. transgenic 9xnfat-luc mice might be used to analyze not only nfatc proteins, but also the transcriptional activation of nfat <dig> by hypertonicity and its regulation by signaling pathways in primary cells and tissues. it was known that nfat <dig> is fundamental to sustain cell function and viability in the renal medulla, a naturally hypertonic environment. here we show that the expression and transcriptional activation of nfat <dig> in lymphocytes are remarkably sensitive to pathologic disturbances of the extracellular tonicity. similar studies using this transgenic mouse model combined with other approaches should help to elucidate the role of nfat <dig> in response to physiopathological tonicity changes in different types of mammalian cells.
