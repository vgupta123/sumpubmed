BACKGROUND
sucrose is the principal transport form of photosynthetically assimilated carbohydrate in higher plants. it is synthesized in the source leaf or the pericarp of the pod and transported via the phloem to sink tissues and provides energy and carbon skeleton to the non-photosynthetic tissues. in sink tissues, sucrose may be used directly for metabolism or translocated to storage tissues  for synthesis of three major storage products  through carbohydrate metabolism. on the basis of these storage products, crops are designated as oleaginous, farinose, or proteinacious crops  <cit> .

sucrose transporter  was first reported in spinach    <cit> . in the last two decades, cdna for suts has been isolated and cloned in higher plants   <cit> . immunolocalization analysis revealed that suts are located in plasma membranes of enucleate sieve and companion cells  <cit> . suts have been reported to be expressed in various tissues of the transport pathway and sink cells in arabidopsis, barley, potato, and rubber  <cit> . mutation studies of suts have revealed that suts are responsible for restraining plant growth and pollen germination  <cit> . antisense transformation experiments have clearly shown that suts also are responsible for retardation of sucrose translocation, fruit size reduction, and lowered fertility in tomato  <cit> . overexpression transformations showed lower sucrose concentration in leaves and increased growth rates of pea cotyledon  <cit> . early stages of seed development in brassica exhibit a sut association with starch and oil accumulation in the embryo; the further growth of the cotyledon leads to lipid synthesis and starch degradation  <cit> . results from another study have suggested that increased lipid synthesis is an effect of sucrose unloading  <cit> . however, detailed reports are lacking for sut in brassica napus .

b. napus is one of the major global oil crops. it is used for direct human consumption, as animal feed, and recently as a source of bio-fuel. high seed yield per unit is one of the most important challenges in b. napus breeding, while the harvest index  is only about  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . generally, the hi of cereal crops can reach  <dig> - <dig>  in crop production under suitable conditions and management, with reserved assimilates in plants contributing 10-40% of the final yield at the grain filling stage  <cit> . the hi of soybean, one of the most important oil crops, also can reach  <dig> - <dig>   <cit>  and has been successfully maximized during breeding  <cit> . investigations have indicated that source and sink organs are not limiting, while assimilate translocation is the most critical limiting factor for seed yield in brassica  <cit> . sut may be a key gene for increasing seed yield by translocating sucrose from source to sink.

in our previous investigation, a functional marker derived from sut was co-localized with seed yield quantitative trait loci  in b. napus  <cit> . we hypothesized that the sut gene affects seed yield in b. napus. here, a complete sut  and promoters were isolated and characterized. a series of experiments and observations of the b. napus sut made it possible to detect alleles located in the a <dig> linkage group, and allelic variation of bna <dig> sut <dig> was associated with seed yield-related traits. bna <dig> sut <dig> b and its promoter are linked to higher seed yield, while bna <dig> sut <dig> a is associated with increased seed weight.

RESULTS
isolation of bna <dig> sut1
three brassica fragments  were obtained from the large-scale sequence analysis results at the arabidopsis information resource database and identified as having high sequence homology with the arabidopsis atsuc <dig>  sequence  <cit> . primers  were designed based on conservative segments . with these primers, the main genomic segments of bnx.sut <dig> were generated; the remnant fragments and promoter were obtained by thermal asymmetric interlaced  pcr in the b. napus cultivar 'eagle'. according to the contig, the complete open reading frame  was identified by using gene prediction programs , and gene-specific primers were developed to generate bnx.sut <dig> in line 's-1300'. of interest, the pt <dig> primer pair, which amplifies the 5'-end of bnx.sut <dig>  generated the expected band in 'eagle' exclusively . thus, more than  <dig> kb of promoter and 5' untranslated region  were obtained by tail-pcr from 's-1300', respectively. based on the predicted 5' and 3' utrs of the candidate sut-like gene, common gene-specific primers were designed: sut-2l  and sut-2r . these primers were used to amplify the full-length cdna and genomic sequences of bnx.sut <dig>  forty-four cdna sequences were isolated from various organs/tissues of 'eagle' and 's-1300' and were classified into four clusters . two clusters showed non-variation sequences and non-distinguished expression in six b. napus lines  and were not included in further work in this investigation. the other two clusters were designated as bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b, obtained from 'eagle' and 's-1300', respectively.

both putative orfs of bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b contain  <dig> bp and encode a protein of  <dig> amino acids. the combination of the cdna and genomic dna sequences revealed that the bna <dig> sut <dig> gene is  <dig> bp in length, containing four exons and three introns. the hydrophobicity profile analysis of bna <dig> sut <dig> revealed the presence of  <dig> transmembrane spanning domains, arranged in two sets of six putative transmembrane domains separated by a long central hydrophilic loop, with both terminal domains and a large central loop located on the intracellular side of the plasma membrane. bna <dig> sut <dig> belongs to the subgroup sut <dig> . the two predicted protein sequences are 98% identical, having seven amino acid differences between bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b , none of them in transmembrane domains. the cdna of bna <dig> sut <dig> shared 76% sequence identity with a published bnsut , which has  <dig> amino acids. the bna <dig> sut <dig> sequence is very similar to the homologues from related species and showed more than 85% sequence similarity with atsuc <dig>  and bosuc <dig>  and 81% sequence similarity with atsuc <dig> . hence, the isolated bna <dig> sut <dig> alleles, homologous with arabidopsis and b. oleracea, are novel sut genes in b. napus.

nucleotide sequence analysis
seventeen primer pairs were designed to generate fragments of about  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. ten primer pairs were designed from the sequences of bna <dig> sut <dig> a and seven from the diverse domains of bna <dig> sut <dig> b. four markers  showed polymorphisms between 'eagle' and 's-1300'. et <dig> and pt <dig>  which were developed from bna <dig> sut <dig> a and its promoter, generated the expected fragments in 'eagle' but not in 's-1300'. by contrast, et <dig> and pt <dig>  amplifying bna <dig> sut <dig> b and its promoter, generated the expected bands in 's-1300' exclusively . the four sequence-characterized amplified region  markers were used to analyze the  <dig> cultivars/lines. and the panel lines were distinguished as three groups by these markers.

the  <dig> partial bna <dig> sut <dig> genomic fragments of ~ <dig> bp were amplified from the panel lines using primer pairs pt1-l/pt1-r and pt5-l/pt1-r , which are located  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream from the start codon of bna <dig> sut <dig>  in total,  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  sites were detected among the lines, including  <dig> snps in the promoter and 5'-utr,  <dig> snps in exons, and  <dig> in introns. the genetic diversity between two regions was analyzed according to distinct different diversities in the 5'-end and gene regions. nucleotide diversity was lower in gene regions  compared with 5'-end regions . tajima's d of gene regions indicated non-significance, while the 5'-end of bna <dig> sut <dig> had a positive and significant tajima's d value . the results indicated that selection was present at the 5'-end and that the selection effect had not extended to the entire gene.

linkage disequilibrium  was estimated between  <dig> pairs of polymorphic sites  in the bna <dig> sut <dig> sequence; two ld blocks were observed at the 5'-end and gene regions, respectively . abundant snps resulted in the same haplotypes among the lines, which could be classified into three clusters consistent with the results of the neighbor-joining distance tree . overall, we found interesting results indicating that the bna <dig> sut <dig> a promoter regulates only bna <dig> sut <dig> a and that the bna <dig> sut <dig> b promoter regulates both bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b, designated as pbna <dig> sut <dig> a- bna <dig> sut <dig> a , pbna <dig> sut <dig> b- bna <dig> sut <dig> a , and pbna <dig> sut <dig> b- bna <dig> sut <dig> b . nucleotide diversity was also separately evaluated for type i, type ii, and type iii based on 382-bp sequences of the 5'-end . type iii and type i presented no polymorphisms and one indel  among  <dig> and  <dig> lines, respectively. however, type ii showed one snp  and three indels  among  <dig> lines .

allelism analysis and genetic mapping
to identify the allelism of bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b, '3715'  and '3769'  were used to develop f <dig>  f <dig>  and bc <dig> populations. with these populations, segregation ratios were analyzed using the markers pt <dig> and pt <dig>  the segregation of heterozygous f <dig> plants to single-band plants in the f <dig> population showed the expected mendelian ratio of 1:2: <dig>  , and the expected ratio of 1: <dig>  in the bc <dig> population . therefore, bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b appeared to be alleles at a single locus.

bna <dig> sut <dig> showed high similarity with the bac  from b. rapa, and three simple sequence repeats  markers were developed according to the bac sequence. additionally, gene-specific primers were designed based on bna <dig> sut <dig> b. an ssr marker  and a gene-specific marker  showed the same polymorphisms found in the 'tapidor-ny7'  doubled haploid  population. hence, bna <dig> sut <dig> was mapped to the a <dig> linkage group of the tn dh genetic map , consistent with result of li et al.  <cit> .

association of bna <dig> sut <dig> with yield-related traits
the mean phenotypic values for individual lines across four environments ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the number of effective first branches ;  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the number of siliques per plant ;  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the number of seeds per siliques ;  <dig>  to  <dig>  g for seed yield per plant ;  <dig>  to  <dig>  g for block yield ; and  <dig>  to  <dig>  g for seed weight  , respectively. analysis of variance showed significant  phenotypic variation for all six yield-related traits among the  <dig> lines , indicating that the assembled panel is suitable for association analysis. heritabilities were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> .6%, and  <dig> % for efb, sp, ss, py, by, and tsw, respectively . significant positive phenotypic and genetic correlations between efb and sp and between yield and silique traits  were observed , indicating that an increase in any of the efb, sp, or ss traits can increase seed yield.

a the numbers above the diagonal are genetic correlation coefficients, and the numbers below the diagonal are phenotypic correlation coefficients.

the panel lines evaluated for yield-related traits were mostly modern cultivars and breeding materials. there were considerable differences among the panel lines according to upgma cluster . population structure was observed among the  <dig> cultivars/lines based on the method by hasan et al.  <cit> .the slope of average likelihoods for the overall population was modeled at k =  <dig> ; the most stable prediction  was obtained with four groups. each group consisted of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> oilseed lines, respectively. taking the ld  level among sites into account and eliminating same-haplotype snps, five sites were significantly associated with at least one of the six yield-related traits . information including location, genotype, frequency, and probability value for each site is shown in table  <dig>  of interest, the snp sites  from the promoter and s <dig> from the exon of bna <dig> sut <dig> were associated with efb and tsw and explained an average 12% and 11% of phenotypic variation throughout the four environments, respectively. the s <dig> snp at the promoter in turn affected sp . phenotypic distributions of the previous four yield-related traits are illustrated in three genotypes by box-plots in figure  <dig>  promoter bna <dig> sut <dig> b was associated with an increased efb number and sp number. for tsw, no significant differences were observed between type i and type ii with bna <dig> sut <dig> a. however, a significant difference was observed between type i and type iii and between type ii and type iii with different bna <dig> sut <dig> alleles. hence, polymorphisms at the promoter and coding domain sequence  of bna <dig> sut <dig> affect yield-related traits interactively.

expression pattern analysis by real-time pcr
spatial and developmental expression profiling of bna <dig> sut <dig> was performed using real-time pcr on all three genotypes, type i, type ii, and type iii, to extract rna from different organs/tissues at the seed-filling stage. bna <dig> sut <dig> mrna showed a higher expression level in vegetative organs, reaching its highest level in stems and leaf blades . greater abundance was detected in stems of type ii and type iii genotypes, indicating that the effect of the bna <dig> sut <dig> b promoter was stronger than bna <dig> sut <dig> a promoter in stems. on the other hand, bna <dig> sut <dig> showed lower expression levels in reproductive organs. in flower buds, bna <dig> sut <dig> showed similar transcript levels in all three genotypes.

when pods reached  <dig> days after flowing , transcription of bna <dig> sut <dig> showed variations in pods, pericarp, and young seeds in different genotypes. higher abundance was detected in pods and pericarp of type iii genotypes and in developing seeds of type i genotypes. the expression level of bna <dig> sut <dig> b was 3-fold higher than that of bna <dig> sut <dig> a in pods, and 10-fold higher in pericarp. however, the expression of bna <dig> sut <dig> b decreased by three times in developing seeds as compared to bna <dig> sut <dig> a, which showed that bna <dig> sut <dig> b accumulated at higher levels in pods and pericarp, while bna <dig> sut <dig> a produced higher expression levels when regulated by the promoter of bna <dig> sut <dig> a . different alleles of bna <dig> sut <dig> also exhibited diverse expression levels when regulated by the same promoter of bna <dig> sut <dig> b, indicating that alleles of bna <dig> sut <dig> also present different gene expression patterns.

in different developmental phases, source leaves were sampled  <dig> days after sowing  initially, then at monthly intervals. the abundance of the bna <dig> sut <dig> transcript declined to a low level at flowering. as pods matured, the expression of bna <dig> sut <dig> again showed increased expression levels . in the developing pods, bna <dig> sut <dig> was highly expressed in the pistil when pods were rapidly elongating and remained at a relatively high level at  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf. however, expression decreased to a low level at  <dig> daf, when the dry weight of pods reached the maximum .

discussion
isolation and genetic variations of bna <dig> sut1
our current research describes the isolation of a novel sut gene bna <dig> sut <dig> and its two alleles bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b in b. napus. the cdnas of bna <dig> sut <dig> a and bna <dig> sut <dig> b showed  <dig> polymorphic sites and variations in seven amino acids, none of which are located in the sut transmembrane. the predicted proteins showed similarity with all the other suts in amino acid sequence and protein secondary structures with histidine residue position  <dig>  <cit> . a higher similarity of bna <dig> sut <dig> with other functional suts indicated that bna <dig> sut <dig> proteins may play an important role in sucrose transport.

we observed frequent sequence exchanges in bna <dig> sut <dig> that resulted in generation of two alleles of bna <dig> sut <dig>  gene conversion and unequal crossing-over are important in generating variation at gene sequences, and recombination events produce novel genotypes  <cit> . sequence analysis of  <dig> b. napus lines showed that the bna <dig> sut <dig> gene could be classified into three genotypes. the type iii genotype showed 98% genomic sequence similarity with the type ii genotype. the polymorphisms were located in the 5'utr, and there was a 3-bp indel polymorphism at position 229- <dig> between the type i and type iii genotypes; the type ii genotype contained either polymorphism. upstream of the indel, type ii and type iii genotypes showed the same polymorphisms among the three genotypes; in contrast, downstream of the indel, type i and type ii presented the same polymorphisms. hence, we hypothesized that type ii is the result of rearrangements between type i and type iii, although this hypothesis requires further molecular evidence. newly generated chimeras were selected and maintained in a population; however, the bna <dig> sut <dig> a- bna <dig> sut <dig> b genotype could not be found in association with the promoter of bna <dig> sut <dig> a and may have been selected against during the breeding process. similar recombination of hvft <dig>  has generated various alleles  <cit> , which support our findings. the zep allele was generated as a result of recombination with different promoters and regulated the expression level of zep  <cit> .

association between bna <dig> sut <dig> and yield-related traits
suts drive translocation of sucrose and in turn affect seed yield and fruit size  <cit> . in another study carried out in our laboratory, identification of yield-related qtls in a b. napus functional map  <cit>  indicated that a functional marker from sut in the a <dig> linkage group was related to efb, sp, and tsw in the a <dig> linkage group  <cit> . here, we report likely polymorphisms in bna <dig> sut <dig> associated with yield-related traits, and allelic variation at the promoter and cds of bna <dig> sut <dig> correlated with expression pattern and phenotype. polymorphisms at the promoter and cds regions with an effect on expression abundance are likely candidates for causative qtps  <cit> . similarly, allelic polymorphism at the promoter and intron of hvft <dig> in barley contribute to variation in flowering time  <cit> .

suts have three types of clades designated as protype sut <dig> , sut <dig> , and sut <dig>   <cit> , and bna <dig> sut <dig> falls into the protype sut <dig> . generally, sut <dig> mrna and protein, notably ossut <dig>  atsuc <dig>  and stsut <dig>  are present in mature phloem and primarily involved in phloem loading. the rice sut, ossut <dig>  plays a significant role in sucrose transport in developing shoots and roots, which is a decisive factor for seed germination and early seedling growth  <cit> . atsuc <dig> also has a role in vegetative growth and for normal gametophyte functioning  <cit> . in higher plants, sugars and hormones interact and form an intricate regulatory sensing and signaling network  <cit> , and altered sucrose levels can change the quantity of sucrose-derived metabolites and sucrose-specific signaling  <cit> . in the current work, bna <dig> sut <dig> showed higher expression levels in the stem of type ii and type iii genotypes, consistent with increased efb. these results indicated that blocking translocation of sucrose at the stem influences either carbon abundance for metabolism or signals.

oilseed plants with lush branches and leaves, in contrast, produce many empty pods and shrunken seeds at maturity, resulting from insufficient import to the developing seeds  <cit> . breeding experiences indicated that translocation of carbohydrate assimilate from source to sink is a major constraint on seed yield  <cit> . the lower expression of bna <dig> sut <dig> in type i genotypes resulted in the lowest yield in the three genotype lines, suggested that retardation of photoassimilate translocation leads to decreased yield. at the pod-filling stage, most leaves abscise and the pod remains primarily a photosynthetic organ  <cit> . the volume of the pod is estimated at  <dig> daf, and the dry weight of the pod reaches a maximum at  <dig> daf when sucrose is stored in the pericarp for the later period of seed development  <cit> . the lower expression observed here of bna <dig> sut <dig> in the pod and developing seed suggests an effective role in the photoassimilate unloading process. bna <dig> sut <dig> showed a reduced expression trend as the pod reached maximum weight . the low expression level of bna <dig> sut <dig> in the pod may be the result of the failure of transportation of sucrose in the developing seed. in our investigation, seed weight was negatively correlated with seed yield. plants with fewer branches and siliques could distribute more storage substance into each seed with a resulting larger seed weight, indicating that 'sink' is sufficient in general oilseed plants. 'source' is also not the limitation for seed yield in oilseed  <cit> . therefore, 'flow' is the most important factor and controls seed yield. our results support this reasoning. the promoter bna <dig> sut <dig> b correlation with increasing efb number may be a potential resource for breeding.

some key genes are closely correlated with yield-related traits. of great interest, application of dwarfing genes caused a green revolution in the 1960s and doubled grain production only in  <dig> years  <cit> . on the other hand, most phenotypic variation of agronomic traits is continuous and remarkably influenced by different alleles. in tomato, alleles of fw <dig>  result in fruit size variation up to 30% and appear to have been responsible for a key transition during domestication  <cit> . plant architecture is very important for improving yield traits; tb <dig> acts as a major contributor to apical dominance in maize and regulates lateral branching in rice  <cit> . moreover, gs <dig> and ghd <dig> show significant effects on grain size and multiple yield-related traits in rice, respectively  <cit> . thus, characterization and application of crucial genes/alleles may be an effective means of improving yield. our investigation indicated that sut may play an important role in sucrose translocation and affect seed yield in b. napus. investigations with larger and/or natural sets of b. napus are necessary to validate the association. furthermore, alteration of sucrose concentration will provide convincing evidence. however, the current characterization of allelic variation and association with yield may be a potential basis for breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
previous qtl analysis of seed yield-related trait associations with functional markers showed that sut was located in the qtl interval associated with branch number and seed weight. in this study, we isolated different alleles of bna <dig> sut <dig> and identified three genotypes. lines with the bna <dig> sut <dig> b promoter exhibited better seed yield-related traits. at the pod development phase, bna <dig> sut <dig> showed an increased expression level and a decreasing trend with increasing seed weight. these results indicate reduced transport of photoassimilate from source to sink. bna <dig> sut <dig> may play an important role in photoassimilate accumulation and storage, in turn affecting seed yield.
