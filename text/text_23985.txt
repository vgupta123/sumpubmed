BACKGROUND
gamma-synuclein – is a member of the synuclein family of small cytoplasmic acidic, predominantly neuron-specific proteins  <cit> . it has been speculated that in the nervous system γ-synuclein is involved in modulation of monoamine transporters  <cit> , cytoprotection  <cit> , chaperone activity  <cit> , microtubule regulation and microtubule mediated organelle trafficking  <cit> . however, the exact mechanisms and consequences of this involvement are to be resolved. in cooperation with other members of the family γ-synuclein plays role in regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission  <cit> . changes of γ-synuclein expression in peripheral tissues has been linked with metabolic and oncological diseases  <cit> .

our previous study showed that γ-synuclein knockout mice display low levels of anxiety-like behavior, high exploratory activity and enhanced habituation  <cit> . it is well documented that cognitive abilities correlate with the level of exploratory activity and habituation scores in rodents  <cit> . these data allow to suggest that γ-synuclein may be one of the factors affecting cognitive function. cognitive dysfunction is one of the most typical characteristics in various neurodegenerative pathologies such as alzheimer’s and parkinson’s disease  <cit> . since γ-synuclein has been implicated in hippocampal axon pathology in parkinson’s disease  <cit> . specific changes of γ-synuclein expression in retina and optical nerve have been reported in alzheimer’s disease patients as well as in patients with glaucoma  <cit> . overexpression of γ-synuclein induces neurodegeneration in animal models  <cit> . the first evidence of a possible link between the expression of γ-synuclein and choline acetyltransferase – an important component of cholinergic neurotransmission have been received  <cit> . at the same time, cholinergic neurotransmission is the key component of cognitive process  <cit> . however, there are no data available on the influence of γ-synuclein on learning and memory.

we hypothesized that γ-synuclein might be involved in some aspects of learning and memory processes in experimental animals. to test this, in the present work, we evaluated learning abilities of mice with target inactivation of γ-synuclein gene in the behavioral tasks that require intact working and spatial memory.

RESULTS
rod suspension test
on the first stage of the work we examined locomotor abilities of the experimental animals. we assessed the grip strength, which is a critical parameter for swimming task as well as for the other tests which require motor activity. in this test the γ-КО group did not show  significant differences in performance from the group of wt mice .

passive avoidance test
baseline step down latencies have shown no significant differences between groups at the pre-training stage. in γ-КО mice we observed  <dig> -fold  increase in step-down latency after training versus  <dig> -fold  increase in wt animals . thus, γ-ko showed an increase in step-down latency by 168%  compared to the wt mice.

active avoidance test
mice were trained for  <dig> days. the results of these experiments expressed as the number of successful avoidance responses over the number of the trials per day are shown in figure  <dig>  starting from the 4th day γ-ko displayed better dynamics of learning. γ-ko mice made a significantly greater number of avoidance responses: on day 4– <dig> fold , day 5– <dig> -fold , day 6– <dig> -fold , day 7– <dig> -fold  and day 8– <dig> -fold  compared to wt mice.

morris water maze
to assess spatial learning, mice were tested in the morris water maze. the results of the test are given in figure  <dig>  γ-ko and wt mice were not significantly different in all phases of water maze training, except for the training day  <dig> when γ-ko mice showed 50%  lower escape latencies compared to wt animals.

object location test
on day  <dig>  wt- and γ-КО mice time spent equal time investigating both objects . on day  <dig>  both wt and γ-КО mice explored the object that was located in a new position for a significantly longer time than the other object .

γ-КО mice explored the displaced object  <dig>  times longer , than the object in familiar location. wt mice explored the displaced object  <dig>  times longer , than object in familiar location . during the test the γ-КО and wt groups showed the same  discrimination ratio:  <dig>  and  <dig>  for γ-КО and wt groups respectively .

discussion
to analyze locomotor abilities of experimental animals, we estimated the grip strength. our study found no significant differences of the motor functions in the knockout mice, which is consistent with previously published data obtained in different motor tasks  <cit> . intact grip strength by the knockouts suggests that muscle tone is not impaired in these mice.

we have shown that young mice with the target inactivation of γ-synuclein gene are characterized high working-memory capacity, but have no alterations in spatial learning and memory. our previous study had revealed that behavioral phenotype of γ-ko mice can be characterized by low level of anxiety and enhanced habituation. these data can explain the improvement of learning in the passive and active avoidance models, used in the current investigation.

at the moment molecular and biochemical basis of the memory improvement in passive and active avoidance tests in γ-ko mice is not well understood. several hypotheses can be assumed. interestingly, inactivation of the expression of highly homologous to γ-synuclein, α-synuclein protein produces partially opposing phenotype – working and spatial memory impairment in adult mice  <cit> . however in spite of high homology in the amino acid primary sequence α-synuclein and γ-synuclein proteins differ in their secondary structure: γ-synuclein has an increased α-helical propensity in the amyloid-forming region   <cit>  which is involved in trafficking of monoamine transporters  <cit> . we can suggest that variations in the secondary structure are responsible for the opposite effects of α- and γ-synuclein gene knockout on expression of dopamine transporter  in the brain  <cit> , that can in turn affect their cognitive ability  <cit> . moreover, inactivation of the gene expression of α- and γ-synuclein has opposite effects on the emotional status of animals  <cit> , which may also be reflected in the observed changes in cognitive abilities. it has been shown previously using the same line of knockout mice that inactivation of γ-synuclein gene alone does not affect expression of α-synuclein mrna or protein in neural tissue  <cit> , therefore our results present a clear effect of γ-synuclein’s inactivation.

it is also possible that in the absence of γ-synuclein a general mechanism of synaptic vesicle turnover and neurotransmitter release are perturbed to the degree that does not noticeably alter animal physiology but affects certain types of behaviour. this idea is consistent with more pronounced changes in neurotransmission observed in α/γ-synuclein double knockout comparing to α-synuclein knockout mice  <cit>  and in triple synuclein knockout comparing to α/β-synuclein double knockout mice  <cit> .

γ-synuclein inactivation did not affect spatial learning in the morris water maze although γ-synuclein is highly expressed in the brain areas involved in spatial learning  <cit>  and its inactivation was shown to cause developmental deficit in the number of dopamine neurons in the midbrain  <cit>  – an essential component for a water maze cued task learning  <cit> . we also did not reveal alterations in spatial memory of γ-ko mice. the most obvious explanation for this fact can be based on different strategies used for the platform search. “route navigation” strategy probably allows γ-ko mice to use their high performing working memory and thus compensate the deficient spatial memory which is critical in «locale navigation» strategy  <cit> . this phenomenon as well as enhancement of working memory in γ-ko compared to wt mice needs further investigation.

thus, our data provide the first evidence that γ-synuclein may be the important component of learning process which primarily based on the functioning of working memory.

CONCLUSIONS
inactivation of γ-synuclein gene leads to improvement of working memory capacity, but not to change spatial memory and learning. our data provide the first evidence that γ-synuclein plays an important role in learning process that is primarily based on the functioning of working memory.
