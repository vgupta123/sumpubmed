BACKGROUND
the rp <dig> locus of maize carries variable numbers of tandemly-repeated genes belonging to the nucleotide binding site, leucine-rich repeat  class of major disease resistance genes  that confer race-specific resistance to the common rust fungus, puccinia sorghi <cit> . the resistance response conferred by these genes is generally activated by a race-specific direct or indirect recognition of pathogen-derived molecules  <cit> . it includes the “hypersensitive response”  which is a rapid localized cell death at the point of pathogen penetration, the induction of pathogenesis associated genes and a variety of other responses  <cit> .

the rp <dig> locus is complex; the well characterized hrp1-d haplotype is composed of nine tandemly-repeated rp <dig> paralogs  <cit>  while the rp <dig> haplotype of the b <dig> line carries four rp1-homologous sequences  <cit>  and more than  <dig> rp1-homologous sequences have been identified in other lines  <cit> . this complexity results in the locus being meiotically unstable  <cit> , with a high frequency of unequal crossover events  <cit> . intragenic recombination events resulting in the generation of chimeric genes derived from two different rp <dig> paralogs have been observed several times. in some cases these lead to the generation of novel resistance specificities  <cit> . in other cases it has led to the creation of dominant mutant genes that confer a “spontaneous necrotic” or “lesion” phenotype  <cit> .

rp1-d <dig> is one such gene  <cit> . it confers a spontaneous lesion phenotype with lesions forming in apparently random locations without the requirement for the presence of a pathogen. previously we showed that the rp1-d <dig> phenotype is influenced by genetic background; in some backgrounds it is very severe, killing the plant during the juvenile phase. in others it is suppressed to the extent that the mutant plants can set seed in a more-or-less normal fashion  <cit> .

the signal transduction pathway leading to the hr response and the mechanism by which the plant is able to restrict the hr to cells in the immediate area surrounding an infection is poorly understood in plants. we are using a series of genetic crosses with diverse lines and with members of segregating populations to identify loci and genes that interact with rp1-d <dig> either to suppress or enhance its expression. the expectation is that many of these loci are also important in the regulation of the ‘normal’ hr induced by wild type r-genes in response to pathogen detection  <cit> . this approach, in which a mutant conferring an extreme phenotype in a trait of interest is used to uncover previously inaccessible genotype-dependent variation has been termed mutant-assisted gene identification and characterization   <cit> .

temperature has long been known to play a role in the modulation of plant defense responses in dicots  <cit> , including the hr  <cit> . in some cases it appears that the temperature-sensitive component of the defense response resides in the nb-lrr genes themselves  <cit> . light sensitivity of resistance responses, including hr, is likewise a well known phenomenon  <cit> . in the course of our studies we noted that phenotypic expression of rp1-d <dig> seemed to be affected by temperature. this effect had been briefly noted previously  <cit> . in light of our ongoing work on the genetic dissection of hr using rp1-d <dig> in a magic approach, and especially because these experiments were taking place in multiple locations under varying environmental conditions, it was important to characterize this temperature-dependent effect further and to ascertain whether there was an interaction with genotype. we show here that while temperature effects on the rp1-d <dig> phenotype were observed in all  <dig> genetic backgrounds tested, the temperature effects were significantly affected by genotype. the phenotype could be completely suppressed in a reversible way by manipulating temperature or light levels.

RESULTS
rp1-d21-associated lesion phenotypes are temperature dependent
the rp1-d21-h <dig> line has the background of the common maize inbred h <dig> into which the rp1-d <dig> allele has been introgressed. it is 97% genetically identical to h <dig>  <cit> . rp1-d21-h <dig> plants are heterozygous for the rp1-d <dig> mutant allele and therefore the f <dig> progeny of any cross between rp1-d21-h <dig> and another line segregate in a 1: <dig> ratio for f <dig> progeny carrying an rp1-d <dig> gene  and f <dig> progeny carrying the wild-type  h <dig> allele at the rp <dig> locus . importantly the wild type and mutant f <dig> progeny were almost entirely isogenic outside the rp <dig> locus  <cit> .

the rp1-d21-h <dig> line and crosses between the rp1-d21-h <dig> line and  <dig> diverse lines were used for this study . all of these lines are among the  <dig> parents of the maize nested association mapping  population  <cit> . importantly for these purposes, these lines represent a diversity of phenotypic effects on the rp1-d <dig> phenotype. table  <dig> is adapted from chintamanai et al.  <cit>  and shows the response of these crosses in the field in two environments, clayton nc and west lafayette in, that we observed in our previous study. included in this experiment are crosses in which the rp1-d <dig> phenotype is substantially suppressed  and several in which it is substantially enhanced  as well as several crosses with intermediate phenotypes.

data are derived from experiments conducted during fall  <dig> and fall  <dig>  in each year the experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with two replicates per year per temperature condition. les was scored on a 0– <dig> scale with  <dig> being no lesions at all and  <dig> being dead. missing data are denoted by a dash .

f <dig> families were derived from crosses between a number of inbreds and the rp1-d21-h <dig> line, which was heterozygous for the rp1-d <dig> gene. the resulting f <dig> families therefore segregated 1: <dig> for the necrotic spotting phenotype associated with rp1-d <dig>  measured in clayton nc in  <dig> and in west lafayette in in  <dig>  lesion score  and mutant to wild type height ratio  were measured as described in the materials and methods.

these f <dig> crosses, together with the rp1-d21-h <dig> line were grown in the greenhouse at three different temperature regimes: 22/18°c, 26/22°c, and 30/26°c higher/ lower for  <dig> hours each. for simplicity, these regimes are referred to here as, respectively, lowgh, midgh, and high . two traits associated with the severity of the rp1-d <dig> phenotype were scored on all the plants, mean lesion score , and mean mutant to wild type height ratio . les is simply a score of the lesion severity  while htr determines how much the growth of the plant has been inhibited by the expression of rp1-d <dig> with respect to a near-isogenic sibling lacking the rp1-d <dig> gene. the mean les and htr scores for all crosses at each temperature are summarized in table  <dig>  the plants grown at the highest temperatures, 30/26°c, had the most suppressed rp1-d <dig> phenotypes  in every case regardless of genotype. however, the ranking of these two traits at 18/22°c and 22/26°c depended on the genetic background although in general the phenotype was most extreme at the lower temperature . the results observed in this study are largely consistent with our previous work  <cit>  with the tx <dig> × rp1-d21-h <dig>  m37w × rp1-d21-h <dig>  m162w × rp1-d21-h <dig> f <dig> crosses showing the most severe phenotypes and the b <dig> × rp1-d21-h <dig>  mo18w × rp1-d21-h <dig>  oh7b × rp1-d21-h <dig> f <dig> crosses among the most suppressed.

analysis of variance  showed that the most significant sources of variation for both les and htr were environment , temperature and genotype. there were also highly significant  interactions between genotype and environment, and genotype and temperature for both traits .

les was scored on a 1– <dig> scale with  <dig> being no lesions at all and  <dig> being dead.

since les and htr measure aspects of the same phenotype, it was not surprising that they were highly correlated. combined data from fall  <dig> and fall  <dig> showed strong negative phenotypic correlation between les and htr . at each temperature range the correlation was strong . the correlation showed a trend of weakening association between les and htr as temperature increased. this was probably because higher temperature suppressed the phenotypic expression of the rp1-d <dig> phenotype.

the effect of temperature reduction on the rp1-d21-associated lesion phenotype
to investigate the effect of changing the external temperature on the expression of the rp1-d <dig> phenotype, we moved some tx <dig> × rp1-d21-h <dig> mutant plants from the high to the lowgh. within  <dig> hours a dramatic phenotypic change was noticed; leaves which had displayed sparse small lesions developed much more numerous and larger lesions within  <dig> hours of the transfer to lower temperatures . genetically identical plants that remained in high conditions did not display this dramatic change .

we subsequently conducted an experiment in which eight f <dig> seed from each of four families from the crosses of rp1-d21-h <dig> to m37w, tx <dig>  m162w and b <dig>  which represent a diversity of rp1-d21supressive and enhancing backgrounds, were planted in growth chambers at 30/34°c - i.e. 4°c higher than the high. after three weeks growth at 30/34°c  no lesions were visible on any of the plants and it was impossible to discern wild type from mutant segregants. in one growth chamber the temperature was then dropped to 18/22°c. after  <dig> hours, half the plants  from the m37w, tx <dig>  m162w f <dig> families developed copious lesions . the plants from the b <dig> f <dig> family took longer to develop lesions but after seven days some lesions were visible on about half of the plants from this family too. in the growth chamber which had remained at 30/34°c all the plants still were indistinguishable from wild type and no lesions were visible on any leaves.

the hr-phenotype associated with rp1-d <dig> can be activated/inactivated reversibly using temperature shifts
at the four-week time point and using the same plants that had been shifted from 30/34°c to 18/22°c, the location at which the emerging leaves joined the main stem was marked on the mutant plants and the temperature of the growth chamber was increased from 18/22°c back to 30/34°c. after seven days, all the newly-emerged leaves and the newly-emerged portions of the leaves that had been partially emerged at four weeks showed no, or in just a few cases, a very few lesions .

in a separate experiment  we grew at least  <dig> mutant f <dig> plants from each of  <dig> different genotypes for four weeks at  <dig> /18°c and then shifted to 34/30°c. at this point the 5th leaves were partially emerged from the whorl. in every case a clear transition from a lesioned to a non-lesioned phenotype was apparent on the 5th leaf .

this result implied two things: firstly that the rp1-d <dig> lesion phenotype could be turned off, then on, then off again simply by increasing the temperature above about 30°c and decreasing it to about 20°c by turns. in other words the activation/inactivation of the hr phenotype was reversible. secondly, since no lesions were visible on portions of the plant that emerged immediately after the temperature was increased to 30/34°c, it implied that the rp1-d21-associated lesions did not form before leaf emergence from the whorl but that something associated with leaf emergence, perhaps exposure to light, was required for the lesion phenotype.

an objectively measurable quantitative assay for rp1-d <dig> temperature-sensitive phenotype
to examine the detailed kinetics of rp1-d <dig> lesion development following transfer to lower temperatures, four different genotypic combinations were selected: f <dig> progenies of rp1-d21-h <dig> crossed to a <dig>  b <dig>  mo <dig> and tx <dig>  the phenotype underlying rp1-d <dig> is highly suppressed in a hybrid combination of h <dig> with a <dig>  but highly enhanced in a hybrid combination with tx <dig> while f <dig> hybrids of rp1-d21-h <dig> with b <dig> and mo <dig> exhibit intermediate phenotypes .

none of the mutants f1s developed rp1-d21-associated lesions in any genetic background when grown at 30°c. eight days after planting, the temperature was lowered to 26°c at which point hr lesions started to become apparent. the speed at which the hr lesions started manifesting was dependent on genotype of the host . the genetic backgrounds that had previously been associated with a more severe rp1-d <dig> phenotype , rp1-d21-h <dig> × tx <dig> and rp1-d21-h <dig> × mo <dig>  displayed lesions within two and three days respectively. of the backgrounds associated with more suppressed phenotypes, b <dig> took seven days for half the plants to display lesions while lesions had not formed on rp1-d21-h <dig> × a <dig> mutants at 26°c plants nine days after the temperature shift. these results demonstrate how the temperature-dependent phenotype of rp1-d <dig> can be converted to an objectively measurable quantitative trait. loci responsible for mediating this temperature sensitivity could therefore by mapped using an approach similar to that which enabled us to map loci associated with rp1-d21-mediated lesion severity in the field  <cit> .

light requirement for rp1-d <dig> lesion manifestation
since it appeared that lesions formed only after emergence from the whorl , we wanted to determine whether exposure to light was important for lesion formation. in a separate experiment, eight seedlings of tx <dig> × rp1-d21-h <dig> and rp1-d21-h <dig> were grown in 34/30°c, with  <dig> h light/ <dig> h dark for  <dig> days. the middle sections of the 4th leaves were wrapped in aluminum foil to avoid exposure to light and the temperature was changed to 22/18°c. as before, lesions appeared within two or three days on the mutant segregants. after four days the foil was removed. the tissue that had been covered by the foil had virtually no lesions but after two further days at the lower temperature  lesions started developing in these regions also . this experiment was repeated a second time with essentially similar results.

it should be noted that wrapping a portion of the leaf in aluminum foil as well as blocking out light, may have the effect of locally increasing the humidity and possibly also the temperature of the wrapped part of the leaf. so, conceivably, altered temperature and humidity might underlie the failure to form lesions. however, we have observed in other experiments that rp1-d <dig> plants grown in bottles at ~100% humidity display characteristic lesions . therefore it seems that both light and a permissive temperature are required for rp1-d21-associated lesions to form.

temperature sensitivity of the defense response associated with rp1-d21
apart from the obvious lesion formation phenotype, we have shown previously that rp1-d <dig> expression is associated with other characteristics of the classical hr response including the generation of h2o <dig> and superoxide as well as the induction of expression of defense-related genes such as pr <dig>  pr <dig>  prms and wip <dig> <cit> . in order to determine whether the rp1-d <dig> phenotype could also be suppressed at the molecular  level at elevated temperatures, the following experiment was performed: twelve seeds from a tx <dig> × rp1-d21-h <dig> f <dig> family were germinated and grown in a growth chamber for three weeks at 30°c. at this point all  <dig> plants appeared as wild type and leaf samples were taken from all of them. the temperature was then reduced to 18°c and within  <dig> hours, as expected, lesions were visible on the entire area of six of the plants, these were the segregants carrying the rp1-d <dig> gene while the plants without lesions were their wild type, near-isogenic, siblings. leaf samples from two wild type and three mutant plants were taken at the four week time-point . semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis was performed on rna extracted from the leaves of these five plants sampled at both the three- and four-week timepoints . the results indicated that, after three weeks of continuous growth at 30°c, pr <dig> and prms were not detectably expressed while wip <dig> was expressed at relatively low levels in both wild type and mutant segregants. after a week at 18°c, all three of these genes were highly induced relative to their levels at 30°c in mutant but not in wild type plants . this therefore indicates that the defense response  associated with rp1-d <dig> lesion phenotype is affected by temperature in the same way as the visible hr response.

while this is, to our knowledge the first detailed demonstration of this phenomenon in monocots, examples of temperature sensitive plant disease resistance genes have been long been known, with high temperatures often suppressing function  <cit> . the tobacco n gene, which confers resistance to tmv and the arabidopsis rpw <dig> gene, which confers resistance to powdery mildew are, like rp1-d <dig>  not effective above 30°c  <cit> . recently the temperature responses of two nb-lrr genes, the n gene and the arabidopsis snc <dig> gene, another nb-lrr gene associated with the defense response  <cit> , were investigated. it was shown that the temperature sensitivity of the defense response they mediated was likely resided in the nb-lrr gene products themselves and not in some component of the downstream signal transduction pathway. our work here further suggests that while the nbs-lrr gene product may be the primary cause of temperature-sensitivity the interaction of other loci and alleles can modulate this effect. alcázar and parker  <cit>  reviewed the interaction of temperature and immune responsiveness in arabidopsis . they suggest that temperature sensitivity might be a characteristic associated with the molecular assembly of which the nb-lrr gene is a part, but which also includes other proteins such as hsp <dig>  they also suggest that, given the prevalence of this type of relationship, temperature sensitivity may have evolved as an adaptive strategy to ‘tune’ the defense response to the local environmental conditions to balance the advantages of a robust defense response  with the disadvantages such as reduced growth and reproductive potential  <cit> .

the basal defense response in arabidopsis has been shown to be regulated in a circadian manner  <cit> . the expression levels of several genes important for resistance to hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and for basal resistance were shown to peak around dawn, the time of peak spore dissemination. in this way, it was hypothesized, the plant was able to synchronize its maximal defense responsiveness to the period of maximal need. of course dawn is also the coldest period of the day and so perhaps the temperature sensitivity of nb-lrr resistance complexes is another way of fine tuning this system. similarly, light dependence of the hr mediated by other r-genes has been observed  <cit> . in some cases, this may reflect a relationship between hr, photosynthesis and the oxidative balance in the cell  <cit> .

we have been using rp1-d <dig> as a reporter for the hr in order to map loci important for controlling natural variation in the maize defense response  <cit> . this work is being performed largely in field experiments in north carolina and indiana. the results reported here suggest that environmental temperature will be an important factor in determining how severe the rp1-d <dig> phenotype is in the field and, more importantly, that different temperatures may differentially affect different genotypes. this is not necessarily surprising. genotype by environment interactions are observed in the vast majority of quantitative trait mapping studies, emphasizing the need for conducting studies over multiple environments.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated here that:

 <dig>  the rp1-d <dig> associated lesion phenotype is temperature-sensitive at both a morphological and a molecular level.

 <dig>  rp1-d <dig> temperature-sensitivity is observed in all genetic backgrounds studied, including backgrounds that both strongly enhance and strongly suppress the phenotype.

 <dig>  however, there is a significant interaction between temperature and genotype. in other words, the response of the rp1-d <dig> phenotype to changes in temperature is, in part, dependent on genetic background.

 <dig>  the effect of genotype on temperature sensitivity can be objectively quantified by examining the kinetics of lesion formation after temperature change.

 <dig>  the rp1-d <dig> phenotype can be suppressed at temperatures above 30°c in all genetic backgrounds studied at both the gross phenotypic and the molecular level.

 <dig>  the rp1-d <dig> phenotype can be suppressed and activated in a reversible manner by altering the external temperature.

 <dig>  light exposure is also required for the rp1-d <dig> lesion phenotype.

as noted above, temperature effects on the r-gene mediated defense response may be a general phenomenon in plants  <cit> . however this is the first time that the interaction of this effect with genetic background has been demonstrated. this implies that other genetic factors other than the r-gene itself are responsible for mediating the effect of temperature. using the rp1-d <dig> system and the magic  <cit>  technique we will now be able to examine the loci and genes underlying this response. furthermore, the precise ability to turn the defense response on and off in a massive and synchronous way provides new resources with which to characterize the molecular and physiological events associated the maize defense response.
