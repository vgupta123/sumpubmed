BACKGROUND
the mammalian skull consists of neurocranium and viscerocranium that are formed from skeletogenic mesenchyme derived from both mesoderm and neural crest  <cit> . the cranial skeletogenic mesenchyme mainly undergoes intramembranous ossification to form the bone plates  <cit> . this process differs from endochondral ossification in the appendicular and axial skeletons, which prior formation of cartilage templates is required. the growth of calvaria is then able to accommodate expansion of the brain  <cit> . during calvarial morphogenesis, cranial sutures serve as skeletogenic growth centers where undifferentiated stem cells develop into calvarial osteoprogenitors, which differentiate to become pre-osteoblasts/osteoblasts localized to the osteogenic front and periosteum. the mature cells then deposit and mineralize bone matrix. osteoblasts either die by apoptosis or are embedded in the matrix, becoming osteocytes.

a patent suture is necessary for continuous growth of the skull bones. defects in either cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis affecting the process of intramembranous ossification have been shown to induce premature fusion of cranial sutures, leading to development of craniosynostosis  <cit> . abnormalities in the developing suture cause severe malformations of the skull, leading to disruption of brain development. cranial dysmorphism resulting from suture closure defects can be familial or sporadic in origin  <cit> . although linkage analyses have shown that genetic mutations are associated with synostosis-related syndromes, the mechanism underlying suture development remains largely elusive. it remains a challenge to understand the maintenance of suture patency which may require undifferentiated cells to be present. these naïve cells are thought to be localized in the suture mesenchyme. better understanding of the genetic regulatory network conveying signals to orchestrate the suture morphogenetic processes promises important insights into pathogenesis of congenital deformities.

our previous work has linked an evolutionary conserved wnt signal transduction pathway for the first time to craniosynostosis  <cit> . mice with genetic inactivation of axin <dig>  a negative regulator targeting β-catenin degradation, exhibit suture abnormalities. the synostosis phenotype is caused by accelerated intramembranous ossification mediated through a dual role of β-catenin in both the expansion of osteoprogenitors and the maturation of osteoblasts  <cit> . moreover, haploid deficiency of β-catenin alleviates the premature closure and calvarial osteoblast defects. the loss-of-function analysis thus suggests the requirement of β-catenin in axin <dig> mediated calvarial morphogenesis.

in this study, we employ a gain-of-function analysis to determine if aberrant activation of β-catenin induces calvarial defects reminiscent to the axin <dig> mutant. a transgenic system integrating the tetracycline-dependent activation and cre-mediated recombination methods has been developed. our findings demonstrate that inducible stimulation of β-catenin causes severe suture abnormalities resembling those with the axin <dig> ablation. the expansion of skeletogenic precursors and their subsequent differentiation are altered, leading to increased bone ossification. β-catenin signaling plays a critical role in development of the suture mesenchyme through modulation of calvarial morphogenetic signaling pathways. furthermore, analyzing mice with disruption of the β-catenin transcriptional target, cyclin d <dig>  we reveal its essential role in the expansion of skeletal precursors. cyclin d <dig> is required for propagation of specific types of osteoprogenitors at various developmental stages.

RESULTS
we previously showed that axin <dig> is expressed in the suture mesenchyme, osteogenic fronts and periosteum essential for suture morphogenesis  <cit> . to investigate if stimulation of β-catenin leads to a causal effect on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation similar to the axin <dig> mutant phenotype, a transgenic system permitting manipulation of gene activity in the axin2-expressing cells was created. using the axin2-rtta transgenic mouse strain expressing an improved version of rtta, rtta2s-m <dig>  under control of the axin <dig> promoter, we tested the capability of conditional gene expression in the developing calvaria. mice carrying the axin2-rtta transgene were crossed with tre-lacz mice to obtain double transgenic mice . their mother was treated with doxycycline  to induce expression of the lacz reporter in the  <dig> day-old pups. the double transgenic skull exhibited strong β-gal staining while no signal was detected in the control . compared with the endogenous axin <dig> expression pattern that is detected by β-gal staining using the axin2lacz knock-in mouse strain  <cit> , the results showed that expression of the lacz reporter was successfully targeted to the suture mesenchyme, osteogenic fronts and periosteum of developing sutures . similar results could also be obtained using a different reporter, tre-h2bgfp, suggesting that the axin2-rtta transgenic strain permits inducible gene expression during calvarial morphogenesis  <cit> .

we then developed a transgenic system combining the tetracycline-dependent activation and cre-mediated recombination methods to determine if aberrant activation of β-catenin affects suture development . this advanced system permits inducible stimulation of β-catenin during calvarial morphogenesis. it allows us to test if constitutive activation of β-catenin signaling causes suture abnormalities, leading to defects in skeletogenesis, similar to that observed in the axin <dig> nulls. first, mice carrying the axin2-rtta transgene were crossed with the tre-cre mice to obtain the axin2cre model. next, the β-catΔex3fx allele was introduced to the axin2cre mice. in these triple transgenic animals, cre recombinase was produced in the axin2-expressing cells in the presence of dox. the expressed cre then deleted exon  <dig> of β-catenin to generate a truncated protein. as a result, a stabilized dominant protein , which lacks important phosphorylation sites  <cit>  and cannot be targeted for proteosome degradation, was generated in the axin2-expressing cells . this sβcatax <dig> mouse model permits stimulation of β-catenin in a spatiotemporal specific fashion during formation of the craniofacial skeleton. inducible expression of sβ-cat in the axin2-expressing cells had significant effects on craniofacial skeletogenesis . the suture regions of the sβcatax <dig> mice were drastically expanded . in addition, bone ossification was enhanced in these mutants compared to the control .

further investigations revealed an increased number of ki <dig> positive cells in the sβcatax <dig> suture region . similar to that observed in the axin <dig> nulls, the expression of a direct wnt target, cyclin d <dig>  was highly stimulated . this was accompanied by stabilization of its target cdk <dig>  which promotes cell cycle g1/s transition . statistical analysis showed that these alterations in cell proliferation significantly contribute to the mesenchymal defects of the sβcatax <dig> sutures . constitutive stimulation of β-catenin causes a detrimental effect on the expansion of skeletal precursors in the developing suture.

we next determined if osteoblast lineage development is affected in the sβcatax <dig> mutants. osteogenic markers expressed at different stages along the osteoblast differentiation pathway were examined . at the osteogenic fronts, we detected that the area of runx2-expressing cells is expanded in the mutants . this is also accompanied by expansion of the regions containing osterix and col <dig> positive cells . in contrast, cells expressing high levels of osteopontin, a late marker for mature osteoblasts, were missing at the sβcatax <dig> osteogenic fronts with only very low levels of osteopontin detected compared to the control counterparts . this suggests that terminal differentiation of mature osteoblasts expressing high levels of osteopontin is prohibited. nonetheless, there is no question that bone ossification is aberrantly elevated in the mutant skulls . to test if inducible expression of sβ-cat promotes differentiation of calvarial precursors into osteoblasts, we then used an ex vivo culture system. in the control culture, which lacks the tre-cre transgene to delete β-catenin exon <dig>  no significant effect on osteoblast differentiation was observed in the presence of dox . however, the dox-mediated expression of sβ-cat caused a ~ <dig> fold induction of alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that the differentiation process was stimulated .

the loss of axin <dig> elevates the signaling activities of fgf and bmp pathways critical for calvarial development and disease  <cit> . therefore, we examined whether these calvarial morphogenetic pathways are interfered by the expression of the dominant β-catenin protein in a manner similar to the axin <dig> mutants. immunostaining analysis with antibodies recognizing the activated/non phosphorylated form of β-catenin  <cit>  confirmed its elevated levels in the sβcatax <dig> suture . fgfr <dig>  fgfr <dig> and fgf <dig>  expressed in the suture mesenchyme are important regulators for bone ossification and maintenance of suture patency. deregulation of these molecules has been extensively linked to development of synostosis-related syndromes  <cit> . fgf signaling, including fgfr <dig> , fgfr <dig>  and fgf <dig> , affected by axin <dig> ablation  <cit> , is also highly active in the sβcatax <dig> mutants. stimulated expression of phosphorylated smad1/5/ <dig> proteins found in the axin <dig> nulls was also observed by the expression of sβ-cat . the results imply that β-catenin stimulation is able to recapitulate the effect of the axin <dig> ablation, leading to activation of the fgf and bmp pathways .

our findings demonstrated that stimulation of β-catenin in the skeletogenic mesenchyme promotes expansion of skeletal precursors, specification of osteoblast cell types, maturation of matrix-producing osteoblasts, and fgf and bmp signaling. these phenotypic and regulatory defects, reminiscent to the axin <dig> deficiency, thus provide evidence to support an essential role of β-catenin in mediating the axin2-null phenotypes using a gain of function approach.

disruption of axin2/β-catenin signaling consistently alters the regulation of its downstream transcription target, cyclin d <dig>  in the canonical wnt pathway  <cit> . the number of cyclin d <dig> positive cells also increases from 7% in the control to 78% in the sβcatax <dig> suture region . however, there is a lack of knowledge on the essential role of cyclin d <dig> in calvarial morphogenesis, contributing to the defects caused by aberrant axin2/β-catenin signaling. to definitively assess the requirement of cyclin d <dig> in development of the craniofacial skeleton, we examined the skull defects caused by its disruption in mice. the loss of cyclin d <dig> apparently interfered with bone mineralization causing a delay of ossification at the newborn stage . a large foramen was observed in the cyclin d1-null skulls, especially in the frontal bones . von kossa staining showed decreased mineralization, resulting in a wider suture region, caused by the mutation . cyclin d <dig> is therefore essential for suture morphogenesis.

to elucidate the mechanism underlying the calvarial abnormalities of cyclin d1-/- mice, we examined development of the osteoblast lineage during embryogenesis. at e <dig> , the cyclin d <dig> deletion reduced the calvarial regions, expressing runx <dig> , osterix  and osteopontin . similar defects were also observed at e <dig>  . in the e <dig>  mutants, bone mineralization was not yet detected by von kossa staining analysis , suggesting an impairment of osteoblast development caused by the loss of cyclin d <dig> 

the impaired osteoblast development might be attributed to defects in expansion of the skeletal precursors in cyclin d1-/- mutants. we therefore examined the well established role of cyclin d <dig> in cell proliferation affected by the mutation. first, in vitro proliferation analysis of skeletal precursors isolated from the wild type and mutant calvaria indicated that the cyclin d <dig> deletion has a negative effect on cell proliferation . we next examined the skeletal precursors undergoing mitotic divisions which are positive for ki <dig> and runx <dig> in the metopic sutures . co-localization analysis revealed two populations of skeletogenic precursors in the suture mesenchyme . while the proliferating cells did not express runx <dig> at the midline suture region , they are runx <dig> positive at the osteogenic fronts . the results thus suggest that there are two distinct populations of naïve cells actively proliferating in the developing suture mesenchyme.

further examination revealed that cyclin d <dig> deficiency reduced both runx <dig> negative and positive populations at e <dig>  . however, at newborn, the expression of ki <dig>  remained affected at the suture mesenchyme, but became unaffected at the osteogenic fronts of cyclin d1-/- which are runx2-expressing cells . this implies that the cyclin d <dig> ablation interferes with the expansion of naïve cells in the developing suture at early developmental stages. as the development proceeds, the effects on the committed osteoprogenitors were somehow alleviated. at newborn, we also observed the status of fgf and bmp signaling in the skeletal precursors at the osteogenic fronts of cyclin d1-/-, which were comparable to the wild type counterparts . the skeletogenic activities at the mutant osteogenic fronts appeared to be restored at newborn.

the lack of sufficient supply of skeletal precursors seems to be the cause of ossification delay which results in a wide open suture between the bone plates at birth. both the runx <dig> negative and positive skeletogenic precursors are affected during embryogenesis. however, the cyclin d <dig> deletion disrupts only proliferation of the naïve cells which do not express runx <dig> while the runx <dig> positive cells at the osteogenic fronts maintain active proliferation at newborn. one possibility is that the loss of cyclin d <dig> is compensated by other d-type cyclins  <cit> . alternatively, other cyclins with similar function, e.g. e-type, have been reported to be elevated due to the loss of cyclin d <dig>  <cit> . analysis of mice expressing only a single d-type cyclin each has revealed that the tissue specific expression patterns of the other remaining cyclin d proteins are lost  <cit> . to test these possibilities, we therefore examined the expression of other g1/s cyclins. the expression of cyclin d <dig>  d <dig> and e were detected at the osteogenic fronts at newborn . their strong presences were also found in the cyclin d <dig> mutants . the results suggest that compensations by these cyclins with similar function to cyclin d <dig> could occur at the osteogenic fronts to overcome the mutation. thus provides a mechanism underlying the independence of cyclin d <dig> on postnatal development of the calvaria.

discussion
studies in the past have suggested the importance of β-catenin signaling in modulating osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in health and disease  <cit> . it has been previously proposed that proliferation of skeletal precursors requires β-catenin  <cit> . in the subsequent development of osteoblasts, β-catenin needs to be activated  <cit> . our prior study of mice with disruption of axin <dig> also indicates a dual role of β-catenin in expansion of skeletal precursors and their differentiation into osteoblasts  <cit> . there is no question about the essential function of β-catenin in regulating the expansion of skeletal precursors. however, there is a need to obtain additional in vivo evidence for its involvement in the maturation process. this has been an obstacle due to the effect of cell proliferation also interfering with cell differentiation. indeed, both deletion and stimulation of β-catenin in the skeletogenic mesenchyme result in delay of calvarial development at embryonic stages  <cit> .

using sophisticated mouse genetic systems, we are able to further our investigation by manipulating the activity of β-catenin in the axin2-expressing cells within the suture mesenchyme. this study provides direct in vivo evidence to support that β-catenin regulates both proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic precursors. stimulation of β-catenin with transgenic expression of a dominant mutant protein in the suture mesenchyme results in calvarial deformities. in these mutants, the expansion of skeletal precursors and their differentiation into osteoblasts are highly stimulated. these abnormalities are reminiscent to those observed in the axin <dig> mutants. the gain-of-function study strongly supports the hypothesis for a dual role of β-catenin in cell proliferation and differentiation during osteoblast development  <cit> .

increasing lines of evidence  <cit>  implicate that canonical wnt signaling is required for self renewal of mesenchymal stem cells and the expansion of skeletogenic precursors during calvarial morphogenesis. this notion is manifest on the sβcatax <dig> model . furthermore, the current study is in agreement with previous suggestion for a continuing role of β-catenin in specification of osteoprogenitors which are runx2+ and osterix+ osteoblasts  <cit> . there has been a report indicating that expression of the sβcatax <dig> mutant prevents terminal differentiation of osteoblasts expressing high levels of osteocalcin  <cit> . we obtained similar results showing that stimulated β-catenin signaling inhibits the mature osteoblasts to express high levels of osteopontin . nonetheless, this inhibitory effect does not impair bone mineralization to take place. because enhanced ossification is clearly demonstrated in the sβcatax <dig> skulls, our results support the previous observation that β-catenin is essential for maturation of osteoblast progenitors into bone matrix-secreting osteoblasts  <cit> . therefore, osteoblasts expressing low levels of osteopontin and osteocalcin are still capable of bone synthesis . genetic studies also indicate that the deletion of osteocalcin  <cit>  or osteopontin  <cit>  in mice does not impair skeletal development.

the sβcatax <dig> mice do not seem to display the exact same phenotype as the axin <dig> mutants. axin <dig>  working upstream of β-catenin in the canonical wnt pathway, might possess additional functions affecting other signaling molecules not regulated by β-catenin. alternatively, the presence of axin <dig> might compensate for the loss of axin <dig> in a certain degree as these two genes can functionally substitute for each other  <cit> . while axin <dig> is still able to regulate β-catenin in the axin <dig> mutants, the stabilized form of β-catenin can no longer be modulated by axin proteins in the sβcatax <dig> mice resulting in the phenotypic difference between the two models.

because of our model permitting conditional stimulation of β-catenin, we have been able to overcome the embryonic lethality and examine its role in postnatal development of the craniofacial skeleton. in early juveniles, the calvarium grows rapidly while skeletal precursors are required to expand significantly. alterations of β-catenin at this stage cause severe proliferation and differentiation defects. in contrast, the skeletal precursor pool is relatively quiescent after mice are  <dig> weeks old. in late juveniles, expansion of skeletal precursors does not seem to be affected by aberrant β-catenin signaling while high levels of bone ossification are detected . unfortunately, mice with inducible expression of the dominant β-catenin protein are unable to survive beyond  <dig> weeks after the initial activation of transgene takes place. the lethality issue, most likely due to the axin <dig> promoter being active in other tissues and organs, has prevented us from assessing the long term effect of the transgenic expression. nonetheless, the new finding nicely complements our previous work using a loss-of-function analysis in which haploid deficiency of β-catenin alleviates the skull defects caused by the axin <dig> disruption  <cit> .

we have previously shown that as a transcriptional target of wnt, cyclin d <dig> is modulated by alterations of the axin2/β-catenin regulatory pathway  <cit> . however, there is a lack of information on linking the cyclin d <dig> function to skeletogenesis  <cit> . to assess the role of cyclin d <dig> in calvarial morphogenesis, a genetic study was performed. cyclin d <dig> apparently has an essential function in calvarial development at embryonic stages. in the cyclin d <dig> knockout embryos, the expansion of both runx <dig> negative and positive skeletal precursor populations are impaired at the suture mesenchyme and osteogenic fronts, respectively. deficiencies in cell proliferation and differentiation have been shown to cause ossification delay of the skull  <cit> . we have identified similar types of ossification deficiencies in the cyclin d <dig> knockouts. the finding thus provides first genetic evidence for the involvement of cyclin d <dig> in calvarial morphogenesis .

as a direct transcriptional target of β-catenin, cyclin d <dig> acts in this regulatory pathway. however, the loss of cyclin d <dig> interferes with only the runx <dig> negative naïve cells within the suture mesenchyme, but not the runx <dig> positive progenitors at the osteogenic fronts at newborns. the skeletogenic signaling pathways of fgf and bmp are also unaffected at the osteogenic fronts. our data imply that the restoration of skeletogenic activities at the osteogenic fronts of cyclin d1-/- might be a compensation effect of other cyclins with similar function. the loss of cyclin d <dig> may be compensated by cyclin d <dig>  d <dig> and e. nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the lethality associated with the cyclin d <dig> deletion could result in selected phenotypic representation. this is because only 72% of mice with disruption of cyclin d <dig> able to survive after birth  <cit> . the mutants with most severe phenotypes are unable to be obtained due to abnormalities in other tissues and organs. furthermore, our study of cyclin d <dig> in craniofacial skeletogenesis raises a question on its involvement in development of the axial and appendicular skeletons. it remains to be determined whether the d-type cyclin has a role in other developments and maintenance of the body skeleton.

CONCLUSIONS
using sophisticated mouse genetic studies, we demonstrate that aberrant stimulation of β-catenin causes calvarial defects resembling those of the axin <dig> mutation. constitutive activation of β-catenin enhances both expansion of skeletogenic precursors and bone ossification. together with our previous findings, these results indicate that β-catenin plays an essential role in the calvarial morphogenetic signaling pathways. in addition, as a direct transcriptional target of β-catenin, cyclin d <dig> is required for the expansion of skeletal precursors during calvarial morphogenesis. this study provides genetic evidence to further support the importance of wnt signaling in calvarial morphogenesis, suggesting a key regulatory pathway of axin2/β-catenin/cyclin d <dig> in development of the suture mesenchyme.
