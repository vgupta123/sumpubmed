BACKGROUND
the human genome has  <dig> chromosome pairs and  <dig> sex chromosomes. this single genome gives rise to several hundred distinct cell types including epithelial, neuronal, lymphocytic, germ, etc. in  <dig>  the human genome was completely sequenced, and it ushered in a new understanding of the breadth and diversity of primary coding sequences 
 <cit> . however, the specific mechanism, explaining how one genome gives rise to a large number of diverse cells and tissues, remains unclear. what has become apparent is that dynamic gene expression levels determined by regulatory networks, whose building blocks are in turn governed by epigenetic chromatin states, may explain how cellular phenotypes are defined.

genomic dna is organized into chromatin;  <dig> base pairs of dna are wrapped around two copies of each of the core histone proteins, namely h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig>  forming a single octameric nucleosome core particle. chromatin is found in two forms: hetero- and euchromatin. heterochromatin is highly condensed, forming tightly packaged chromatin. in this compact state, a high density of repetitive dna elements such as satellite dna and transposable elements are found, and the dense packing of dna makes it less likely for transcription factors to bind 
 <cit> . in euchromatin, by contrast, chromatin is relatively ‘open’ or loosely packaged, forming ‘beads on a string’ structures. in this open form, gene regulatory proteins may easily bind to the dna, and nuclear processes such as transcription can be performed and influenced by dynamic nucleosome positioning 
 <cit> . nucleosome position and histone marks play important roles to demarcate regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers, and repressed regions.

enhancers are non-directional regulatory elements that control gene expression at a distance on linear dna 
 <cit> ; i.e. they reside in so-called non-coding dna regions such as intergenic regions and introns. several histone marks  
 <cit>  and nucleosome-depleted regions have been shown to correlate or to be associated with regions that display enhancer activity; nucleosome-depleted regions can be visualized by dnasei-sensitivity and/or formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements  
 <cit> . enhancers generally contain dna-recognition motifs for transcription factors, which regulate gene expression upon binding, and loop to the transcriptional start sites of target genes 
 <cit> .

recently, a number of studies investigated the roles of regulatory elements, distal from transcription start sites  , and revealed that the multiplicity of cell states was determined by tissue-specific distal regulatory elements 
 <cit> . in the present study, we hypothesized that cell type specific enhancers may distinguish breast epithelial cells with different phenotypes. in order to identify such specific enhancers related to the maintenance of distinct breast epithelial phenotypes, human mammary epithelial cell  and breast cancer cell line  were chosen to study, representing extremes of breast epithelial cells. in addition, both cell types were selected because they have been shown to be estrogen receptor  negative: mdamb <dig> is a triple-negative breast cancer cell line 
. it is known that breast cancer  can arise from the transformation of a normal er-negative mammary epithelial cell 
 <cit> . previous studies support the notion that epithelial to messenchymal transition  in breast cancer is linked to the triple negative  breast cancer subgroup and even to cancer stem cells 
. however, it has been shown that er signaling can regulate emt 
 <cit> . the presence of er in certain bca cells may complicate analyses by having differently regulated genes and changes in chromatin structures upon er binding to regulatory elements 
 <cit> . by using chip-seq and faire-seq methods, we identified enhancers, which were unique to each cell type of breast epithelial cells  -- we specifically excluded er + cell lines from our analyses for reasons alluded to above. the expression profiles of genes in these two types of cells along with histone marks were investigated in order to identify the target genes of cell type specific enhancers. in our view, information gained using the approaches described in this study will aid the understanding of epigenetic regulation and breast cancer biology.

RESULTS
characterization of breast epithelial cell type specific enhancers
identification of enhancer specific histone modification mark, h3k4me <dig> by chip-seq, revealed  <dig>  peaks in both cell types. unlike other histone marks such as h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac, the overlap of h3k4me <dig> peaks between two cell types were only  <dig> percent for hmec and  <dig> percent for mdamb <dig> . this indicated that large numbers of enhancers defined by this histone modification mark were unique to either cell type, and there were relatively more h3k4me <dig> marked enhancers in hmec than mdamb <dig>  for further downstream analysis, we selected the top  <dig>  most robust cell type specific h3k4me <dig> sites  ranked by fold-change of chip-seq tags between two cell types using findpeaks software from homer   
 <cit> . in order to verify the method used to identify cell type specific enhancers, we compared our hmec specific enhancer loci  with enhancers classified by using a multivariate hidden markov model in hmec from encode database 
 <cit> . ninety-seven percent of hsel  overlapped with hmm enhancers , indicating that our method is applicable. at hmec specific enhancer loci , h3k4me <dig> marks were highly enriched in hmec, compared to mdamb <dig> with more than  <dig> fold higher mean density of h3k4me <dig> chip-seq tags . to illustrate, we selected a distinct hsel located in the intron of cdh <dig> and 60 kb upstream of the cdh1’s transcription start site. cdh <dig> and cdh <dig> encode calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoproteins, e-cadherin and p-cadherin, respectively. e-cadherin is expressed in most normal epithelial cells, and loss of e-cadherin expression has been observed in various tumors including breast cancer 
. unlike e-cadherin, p-cadherin is expressed in limited epithelial tissues, and it has been reported that this gene is aberrantly expressed in breast cancer cells 
. similarly, we identified mdamb <dig> specific enhancer loci  unique in the mdamb <dig> cell type . an example of such a msel site is located 20 kb upstream from the transcription start site of bmp <dig>  which encodes a bone morphogenetic protein  <dig> . bmps are first detected in extracts of bone and they regulate various developmental processes 
 <cit> . bmp <dig> is involved in development of mammary gland and required for migration and invasion of breast cancer

next, we investigated the genomic distributions of the hsel and msel. most of the hsel and msel specific marks were found in introns and intergenic regions . the hsel and msel were distributed evenly throughout the genome, with no specific chromosomal enrichment . remarkably, although the two sets of putative enhancer groups were mutually exclusive , some of them still appear to cluster in the same genomic regions as exemplified by chromosome  <dig> . these data seem to be consistent with the finding that cell type specific enhancers with related functions cluster in chromosomal regions with correlated gene expressions in different cell types 
 <cit> . these speculative enhancer clusters may be related to the high density of tsss, high density of pioneer protein binding, and/or chromatin structures at these regions. in order to test these possibilities, further investigations near the enhancer clusters such as calculating gene density, transcription factor binding, analyzing dna methylation, and nuclear lamina associated domains are required.

nearby gene expression change by cell type specific enhancers
the next biological question was to determine which genes might be targets of the cell type specific enhancer loci identified above . to this end, the differentially expressed genes in hmec and mdamb <dig> were analyzed using published data 
 <cit>  and then matched to the cell-type specific enhancers identified here. several approaches were used to examine the relationships between cell type specific enhancers and gene expression.

in the first approach, we selected the highest confidence cell type specific genes and examined their distribution relative to cell type specific enhancers. for this purpose, genes with a p-value <  <dig>   were ranked based on their fold-change in two cell type. the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes, which represent about the top  <dig> percent of the genes, were selected and statistical enrichment analyses were performed, using a fixed-distance metric of 100 kb to the nearest enhancer site. there were twice as many overexpressed genes in hmec than randomly sampled genes , whose transcription start sites were located within 100 kb of hsel . similarly, there were  <dig>  times as many overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> than randomly sampled genes, whose transcription start sites were located within 100 kb of msel  . under the hypothesis of independent assignment of the feature, cell type specific enhancers and overexpression, we found that the number of differentially expressed genes having hsel would be between  <dig> and  <dig> genes  by direct simulation . similarly, the number of differentially expressed genes having msel would be between  <dig> and  <dig>  if the relationship between expression and cell type specific enhancer was independent. the above reported numbers of  <dig> and  <dig> for overexpressed genes  with cell type specific enhancers  fell outside of these intervals. conversely, the reported numbers of  <dig> and  <dig> for underexpressed genes  in hmec and mdamb <dig>  respectively with cell type specific enhancers  were below  <dig> and  <dig> . therefore, these data suggest that overexpressed genes in one cell type  are enriched in the vicinity of cell type specific enhancers hsel and msel respectively, and this enrichment is accompanied by a concomitant depletion of cell type specific enhancers from the other cell type.figure  <dig> 
expression level of nearby genes of the hsel and msel.  number of genes with cell type specific enhancer loci  from top  <dig> overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> , top  <dig> overexpressed genes in hmec , and three randomly selected  <dig> gene datasets as controls . the enrichment of genes with cell type specific enhancer loci in each group was calculated by performing chi-square test between groups.  log fold change of nearby gene expression boxplot for the hsel and msel . student t-test was applied between groups in order to calculate p-values. nearby genes of cell type specific enhancer loci , msel ) were categorized to three groups; overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> , overexpressed genes in hmec , and no change in gene expression , and fraction of genes for each category was graphed. eight different window sizes were used for the nearby gene distance from cell type specific enhancer loci: from 20 kb windows of cell type specific enhancer loci  up to 2 mb windows .



in a second approach, we centered our analysis on the cell type specific enhancers and compared the expression profile of genes within a 100 kb window on either side of the hsel or msel. if it is indeed the case that there is a relationship between the presence of cell type specific enhancers and differentially expressed genes, then we should be able to detect an effect of such enhancers on nearby gene expression. on average, the expression levels of genes with hsel  were significantly higher in hmec than mdamb <dig> as indicated by the plotted ratio, compared to control genes, which were not near hsel . likewise, the average expression levels of genes with msel  were higher in mdamb <dig> than hmec as indicated by the plotted ratio, compared to control genes, which were not near msel . in addition, we plotted all the genes within a 100 kb window on either side of the hsel or msel in a scatter plot with x-axis for expression levels in hmec and y-axis for expression levels in mdamb <dig>  among genes within a 100 kb window on either side of the hsel, there were more overexpressed genes in hmec than in mdamb <dig>  conversely, among genes within a 100 kb window on either side of the msel, there were more overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> than in hmec . collectively, these results indicated that cell type specific enhancers were well correlated with differentially expressed genes in both cell types.

in order to infer the physical range over which the presence of cell type specific enhancers influences gene expression levels, we examined the fraction of differentially expressed genes as a function of distance from the enhancer. to this end, genes were grouped in increasing window sizes around the cell type specific enhancers from 20 kb up to 2 mb. all the genes within given window sizes of cell type specific enhancers were then categorized as either overexpressed in hmec, overexpressed in mdamb <dig>  or not differently expressed genes.

genes nearby hmec specific enhancers were expressed higher in hmec compared to mdamb <dig>  but the effect decreased as the distance between hsel and nearby genes increased in general. for instance, the overexpressed genes in hmec were  <dig>  times more than overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> within a 100 kb window on either side of these hsel  . however, the overexpressed genes in hmec were only  <dig>  times more than overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> within a 750 kb window on either side of these hsel. there were still relatively more overexpressed genes in hmec even within a 2 mb window on either side of the hsel. this maybe due to the fact that average expression value for all genes probed in the microarray was a little bit higher in hmec as a possible result of having more enhancers in hmec, compared to mdamb <dig> . among control genes, which were not near hsel, the overexpressed genes in hmec were about  <dig>  times more than overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> regardless of the distance . therefore, we can interpret these results that there were significantly more overexpressed genes in hmec when the distance from hsel was smaller than 750 kb. the effect decreased if the window size increased from 750 kb to 2 mb. when the distance between hsel and nearby genes was bigger than 750 kb, the fraction of overexpressed genes in hmec was not statistically significant, compared to control genes  .

conversely, more genes nearby mdamb <dig> specific enhancers were expressed higher in mdamb <dig>  compared to hmec when the window size was smaller than 750 kb. the overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> were  <dig>  times more than overexpressed genes in hmec within a 100 kb window on either side of these msel  . the effect of msel on increasing gene expression in mdamb <dig> vs. hmec was most significant when the window size between msel and nearby gene was 100 kb . however, the effect decreased as the window size increased. thus, almost the same number of overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig>  and overexpressed genes in hmec  was found within a 750 kb window on either side of these msel  . in control genes, which were not near msel , there were more overexpressed genes in hmec than overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> regardless of the distance .

as another control dataset, we selected  <dig>  h3k4me <dig> sites found in both cell types  , and investigated gene expression levels near the shared enhancers from window size 20 kb to 2 mb. unlike genes near cell type specific enhancers, there were approximately the same number of overexpressed genes in hmec and overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> across the window size from 20 kb to 2 mb . for example, there were  <dig> overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> and  <dig> overexpressed genes in hmec within a 100 kb window of shared enhancers . within a 2 mb window of shared enhancers,  <dig>  overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> and  <dig>  overexpressed genes in hmec were found.

as chepelev et al 
 <cit>  and sheffield et al 
 <cit>  suggested, our findings further supported that on average, cell type specific enhancers seemed to regulate genes closer than 100 kb, but the effect decreased as the gene distance increased: the significance of correlation was evident with nearby genes as far 750 kb from cell type specific enhancers . these findings remained consistent when we investigated genes at each distance interval from window size 20 kb to 2 mb of enhancers . overall, cell type specific enhancers were correlated with nearby genes, which were differentially expressed in both cell types.

enhancer status and nearby gene expression level change
recently, several groups categorized enhancers into a number of functional classes by using histone modifications 
 <cit> . from these studies, it became apparent that h3k27ac marks demarcate active enhancers, whereas h3k4me <dig> marks define both active and poised enhancers. in other words, enrichment of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac correlated with active and engaged enhancers 
 <cit> , whereas poised enhancers  correlated with relatively lower expression levels of the target genes 
 <cit> .

in order to determine whether the expression levels of nearby genes in our study were also correlated with the enhancer status as defined above, we classified hsel as poised  or active  using k means linear clustering with h3k27ac chip-seq data 
 <cit>  . when classifying the msel in a similar manner,  <dig>  poised msel and  <dig> active msel were identified .figure  <dig> 
poised and active enhancers.  h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac chip-seq tags from hmec at the hsel were graphed in the heatmap  . mean density of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac chip-seq tags from hmec at the poised hsel  and the active hsel   h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac chip-seq tags from mdamb <dig> at the msel were graphed in the heatmap  . mean density of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac chip-seq tags from mdamb <dig> at the poised msel  and the active msel   log fold change of nearby gene expression boxplot for the poised/active hsel and poised/active msel. student t-test was applied between groups in order to calculate p-values.



next, the expression levels of nearby genes  of the poised and active enhancer groups as defined above were assessed by randomly selecting  <dig> poised hsel,  <dig> active hsel,  <dig> poised msel, and  <dig> active msel. on average, genes near poised hsel were significantly overexpressed in hmec relative to mdamb <dig> : genes located outside of hsel were not differentially expressed . the average expression levels of genes located near active hsel were even higher in hmec than mdamb <dig> . conversely, on average, genes near poised msel were expressed at higher levels in mdamb <dig> than in hmec, and the expression levels in mdamb <dig> were even higher for genes near active msel . therefore, cell type specific enhancer status defined by histone modifications was positively correlated with cell type specific regulation of nearby gene expression.

detection of nucleosome-depleted regions at both poised and active enhancers
in order to investigate open chromatin regions at cell-type specific enhancers, we first intersected faire-seq peaks  from hmec with the hmec specific enhancer loci . most of these open chromatin regions in enhancers correspond to nucleosome-depleted regions 
 <cit> . among our  <dig>  hsel, hmec faire peaks were found with surrounding enhancer histone marks in  <dig>  hsel . among these sites,  <dig> hsel were poised, and  <dig> of them were putatively active . on the other hand, among our  <dig>  msel,  <dig>  coincided with mdamb <dig> faire peaks  with surrounding enhancer histone marks . among them,  <dig> were poised, and  <dig> were putatively active . as a priori defined, h3k4me <dig> marks were more enriched than h3k27ac in poised enhancers, and h3k27ac density was much higher than h3k4me <dig> in active enhancers. however, the mean density of faire peaks in either poised or active enhancers was similar . overall, regardless of enhancer status, about fifty percent of enhancers were at nucleosome-depleted regions. although one study reported that h3k27ac is not enriched in enhancers without dnasei hypersensitive sites 
 <cit> , our results suggested that the h3k27ac mark was not dependent on the presence of nucleosome-depleted regions, as detected by faire. poised enhancers still retained nucleosome depletion even without h3k27ac enrichment .figure  <dig>

we investigated this relationship even further by correlating faire signals with the expression levels of genes within a 100 kb window of the signal. when the top  <dig>  cell-type specific nucleosome-depleted regions were selected and nearby gene expression levels were calculated, significant correlations were apparent between the nearby gene expression levels and presence of cell type specific faire signals .

in order to determine whether the presence of faire peaks in hsel and msel can further increase the apparent specificity of association with cell-type specific gene expression, we again examined gene expression. when the poised and active cell type specific enhancers were further classified according to faire signals, and the expression level differences of nearby genes  were assessed, hsel with faire signals seemed to more strongly associate with nearby cell type specific gene expression levels at both enhancer states . however, there was no statistically significant difference in gene expression levels near msel by the presence of faire signals . in our analyses, faire signals in enhancers seemed to significantly affect gene expression levels in normal breast epithelial cells, but not in the breast cancer cells. in addition, when all of the faire signals in hmec  were intersected with  <dig> different histone modification marks , more than ninety-seven percent of peaks coincided with above histone marks . therefore, the regions identified by faire seem to represent a subgroup of regions enriched by various histone marks 
 <cit> , indicating the importance of histone marks surrounding the faire signals than faire signals themselves.

transcription factors in breast epithelial cell type specific enhancers
nucleosome-depleted regions are known as sites of transcription factor occupation 
 <cit> . therefore, we searched for such motifs, which may be found at faire peaks in hsel and msel by using transfac and jaspar 
 <cit> . this database also contains motif matrices from best-scoring tf binding sites identified with a chip-chip or chip-seq fragment. the search was restricted to the response elements of factors that were known to be expressed in these cells 
 <cit> . a chi-square test was performed between the groups to measure the enrichment of transcription factor response elements .

the results of transcription factor motif searches at faire signals in the hsel and msel revealed that several response elements such as tp <dig>  tfcp <dig>  smad <dig>  nf <dig>  and ep <dig> elements were more highly enriched at hsel than at msel . on the other hand, fos, foxa, and tcf <dig> were highly enriched in the faire regions at the msel, compared to at hsel. tp <dig>  which is the most significantly enriched motif in hsel compared to msel, is known to act as a sequence-specific dna binding transcriptional activator or repressor. tp <dig> plays an essential role in epidermal development and regulates multiple pathways such as bmp and notch signaling 
 <cit> . tp <dig> has complicated roles in human cancer: some studies reported its tumor suppressor activity in breast and bladder cancers, but it acted as an oncogene in lung cancer cells 
. it may be required in conjunction with tp73/p <dig> for initiation of p53/tp <dig> dependent apoptosis in response to genotoxic insult and the presence of activated oncogenes 
 <cit> . in order to test whether transcription factors, which were identified by motif searches, physically bind to breast epithelial cell type specific enhancers, we performed site-specific chip analyses by using tp <dig> antibody in both hmec and mdamb <dig> cells. as the motif search suggested, tp <dig> was enriched in multiple cell type-specific enhancers of hmec, located in the intron of the tp <dig> gene in 1p <dig> , gene desert region in 2q <dig>  intron of schip <dig> gene in 3q <dig> , and gene desert region in 10q <dig> . however, at the same enhancer no tp <dig> binding was detected in mdamb <dig> cells; neither enhancer histone marks nor a faire signal was detected in mdamb <dig> cells . the observation that tp <dig> binding coincided with open chromatin regions marked by enhancer histone modifications, may be related to their relative expression and protein levels and/or to the fact that the respective cell-type specific enhancers were more or less permissive to transcription factor binding due to their chromatin structures. in order to further investigate this, we measured the expression level of tp <dig> gene in hmec and mdamb <dig> by performing additional rt-qpcr and re-visiting the data from microarray data . although there was a small discrepancy between expression levels among exons we measured, tp <dig> gene was expressed at higher levels in hmec than mdamb <dig>  we also measured protein levels of tp <dig> using western blots, and found that tp <dig> protein level was higher in hmec than mdamb <dig> . therefore, our data here cannot distinguish if cell type specific tp <dig> binding in these enhancers is due to its protein level and/or chromatin accessibility. however, recent studies reported that tp <dig> binding may require accessible chromatin and/or additional transcription factors that cooperatively associate with dna 
 <cit> . further investigations on tp <dig> activity such as its possible ability to penetrate local nucleosome structures as a pioneer protein or recruit other factors will facilitate the understanding of tp <dig> binding mechanism in breast cancer.table  <dig> 
motif enrichment in cell type specific enhancers




when we further compared the enriched motifs between the poised and active enhancers, besides above factors, nr3c <dig>  nfatc <dig>  foxq <dig>  and pbx <dig> motifs were significantly enriched at active hsel than poised hsel. conversely, vdr, tfap2a, tfcp <dig>  bhlhe <dig>  and nfic motifs were more enriched at poised hsel than active hsel . amongst the msel, fli1//ewsr <dig>  gabpa, elk <dig>  myb, and nr2f <dig> were enriched at active msel than poised mse. conversely, foxa motifs were significantly enriched in poised msel relative to active msel .

identification of target genes for each cell type specific enhancer
nearby genes of cell type specific enhancers  were studied to identify more specifically those target genes, whose expression levels were regulated mainly by cell type specific enhancers. for each cell type, there were about  <dig>  genes  in 100 kb windows around cell type specific enhancers. among them,  <dig> genes were found in both windows of cell-type specific enhancers since some cell-type specific enhancers were clustered. in order to identify specific target genes for each cell type specific enhancer, the overlapped genes were excluded for further analysis. among the genes located near hsel only ,  <dig> percent  had higher expression levels in hmec than mdamb <dig>  whereas  <dig> percent  had higher expression levels in mdamb <dig> than hmec . similarly, among the genes located near msel only ,  <dig> percent  had higher expression levels in mdamb <dig> than hmec, whereas  <dig> percent  had higher expression level in hmec than mdamb <dig>  .

furthermore, active enhancers regulated gene expression level more significantly than poised enhancers, and they were engaged with promoters of target genes through dna looping 
 <cit> . therefore, among cell-type specific enhancers, only active enhancers as defined above were chosen, and their putative specific target genes were matched by using nearby cell type specific genes . finally, we identified  <dig> genes, with higher expression levels in hmec than mdamb <dig> near active hsel . these genes were considered regulated by  <dig> active hsel . similarly,  <dig> genes were identified with higher expression levels in mdamb <dig> than hmec near active msel . thus,  <dig> active msel near these genes likely regulate their expression . as an example, one of the active hsel, which was located  <dig>  kb downstream of the transcription start site of the gene, marveld <dig> seemed to increase the expression level of marveld <dig>  pi4k2a, and avpi <dig> genes in hmec . another example was the active msel, located in the intron of kank <dig> genes, and it may regulate the gene expression levels of spc <dig>  ldlr, and kank <dig> . in order to verify the expression levels of these genes in both cell types, we performed rt-qpcr by designing two primer sets for each gene . marveld <dig>  pi4k2a, and avpi <dig> genes, near the hsel in 10q <dig>  were expressed higher in hmec than mdamb <dig>  conversely, spc <dig>  ldlr, and kank <dig> genes, near the msel in 19p <dig>  were expressed at higher levels in mdamb <dig> than hmec. according to our calculations of all enhancer specific gene, up to  <dig> nearby genes are regulated by one active cell type specific enhancer, and up to  <dig> different active cell type specific enhancers may regulate one gene.figure  <dig>

lastly, the selected genes, which we identified as putatively regulated by active cell type specific enhancers, were further analyzed by performing gene ontology . when the difference between enrichment of genes in both cell types for each go biological process category was measured, it was found that there were more genes involved in proteolysis, epidermis development, cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and wound healing in hmec selected genes than mdamb <dig> selected genes . on the other hand, of the genes that we proposed to be under the control of mdamb <dig> specific enhancers, a greater proportion were classified as being involved in mitosis, cell cycle, dna replication, chromatin modification, and cell division, compared to hmec selective genes  . in order to illustrate relationships among differentially enriched go process categories of hmec and mdamb <dig> selected genes, a comparison chart was generated using quick go 
 <cit>  .

genes, that are involved in differentially enriched go biological process categories are listed in a table 
 <dig>  for example, lamc <dig>  which is involved in epidermis development and cell adhesion, is overexpressed in hmec than mdamb <dig>  this gene is translated as a gamma  <dig> laminin protein, which belong to a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins that constitute basement membranes. this gene is reported to be down-regulated in various human cancers including breast cancers 
 <cit> . as another example, spc <dig>  which is involved in mitosis, cell cycle, and cell division process, is expressed at higher levels in mdamb <dig> than hmec . spc <dig> acts as a component of ndc <dig> kinetochore complex, which is required for chromosome segregation and spindle checkpoint activity. this gene is expressed at higher level in grade  <dig> breast tumors, which are poorly differentiated but highly proliferative 
 <cit> . spc <dig> protein interacts with bub1b protein according to the previous study, which identified mitotic protein complexes by using tandem-affinity purification of human epithelial cells arrested in mitosis 
 <cit> . bub1b is also one of our mdamb <dig> selected genes, regulated by the msel in 15q <dig> . bub1b, which is also known as budding uninhibited by benzimidazules  <dig>  encodes a kinase involved in spindle checkpoint function. this protein inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex  and delays the onset of anaphase, which will ensure proper chromosome segregation 
 <cit> . previous studies reported that bub1b expression level is altered in breast tumors, and the encoded protein is mutated in colorectal cancer and breast cancer 
 <cit> . bub1b protein is also known to activate p <dig> via phosphorylation

next, we tested whether hmec selected genes, which may be regulated by hsel, were involved in different biological processes from randomly chosen overexpressed genes in hmec . interestingly, the gene ontology categories found above  were not differentially enriched between hmec selected genes and random data set . when we compared mdamb <dig> selected genes and randomly chosen overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> , the gene ontology categories found above  were not differentially enriched between mdamb <dig> selected genes and random data set . as additional control datasets, we further tested whether hmec selected genes and randomly chosen overexpressed genes in mdamb <dig> were involved in different biological processes. interestingly, go process categories, differently enriched between hmec and mdamb <dig> selected genes  were also differentially enriched in this comparison . conversely, same go process categories were found to be differentially enriched from comparison between mdamb <dig> selected genes and randomly chosen overexpressed genes in hmec . therefore, we propose that genes located proximal to hsel or msel seem to be involved in similar biological processes  defined by differentially expression. in summary, we did not find any distinct biological process category that was enriched in genes located proximal to hsel or msel, compared to the differentially expressed genes.

CONCLUSIONS
recent encode data reveal that the average number of enhancers interacting with a tss was  <dig> , and the average number of tsss interacting with a distal element was  <dig>  in human cells 
 <cit> . therefore, it is likely that a large number of chromosomal contacts and interactions are orchestrated by the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus. in the spatial genome organization, intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions are mediated by nuclear components such as transcription and replication machinery, polycomb bodies, and contacts with the lamina 
. in the study from the dekker lab, when the contact probability was estimated across all chromosomes in human cells, the contact probability decreased as the genomic distance increased, showing a power-law behavior between genomic distance 500 kb and 7 mb with an average exponent α ∼  <dig> . this observation led to the suggestion that the organization of chromatin packing was consistent with the behavior of a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation 
 <cit> .

consequently, the proximity of genes to enhancers on linear dna, which controls their expression, has long been thought to be the main factor of transcriptional regulation via enhancers, called cis interactions. on the other hand, trans interactions between enhancers and genes on different chromosomes are possible to regulate gene expression, but less frequent 
 <cit> . methods that define interactions between dna regions and gene expression include chromatin conformation capture  and its derivative methods  
 <cit> , expressed quantitative trait loci  
 <cit> , the use of transcription activator-like effector nucleases  
 <cit> , and knock-out mouse models 
 <cit> . however, methods employing the capture of looping interactions by cross-linking chromatin are technically demanding for cis interactions since the background signals of random collisions  are high. therefore, it is almost impossible to distinguish the interaction frequency of looping between a gene and sites located within 50 kb away from no looping 
 <cit> . additionally, eqtl analyses, talen, and transgenic mouse modeling cannot inform whether the interactions are direct or indirect.

here we evaluated cis interactions between enhancers defined by histone modification and nearby genes in normal breast epithelial cells  and breast cancer epithelial cells . we showed that enhancers affected the expression levels of nearby genes up to 750 kb away on average, but the effect diminished as the distance increased. enhancer status defined by histone marks correlated with the expression levels of nearby genes. nucleosome-depletion, marked by faire signals was present in fifty percent of both poised and active enhancers. by performing a motif search in enhancers and chip assays, we revealed transcription factors , which may be involved in regulating breast epithelial enhancer-mediated gene expression. we also identified putative target genes of the active cell type specific enhancers by genomic distance  with cell type specific gene expression. the putative target genes of cell type specific enhancers in normal breast epithelial cells  were enriched in proteolysis, epidermis development, and cell adhesion biological process. on the other hand, more genes potentially regulated by breast cancer cell type specific enhancers  were involved in mitosis, cell cycle, dna replication, chromatin modification, and cell division process. when we further compared expression levels of these genes in normal breast and invasive breast carcinoma tissues using the cancer genome atlas  breast cancer data 
 <cit> , we found that  <dig> genes of mdamb <dig> selected genes belonged to top  <dig> percent overexpressed genes in breast tumors than normal breast tissues, and  <dig> genes of hmec selected genes belonged to top  <dig> percent under-expressed genes . the list of these genes includes not only a large number of known breast cancer genes , revealed by previous studies using breast tumor tissues and breast cancer cell lines 
 <cit>  but also novel genes. the list of more than  <dig> putative target genes of more than  <dig> selected cell type specific enhancers and identified transcription factors will facilitate understanding of epigenetic regulation in breast biology as well as cancer etiology.
