BACKGROUND
the de novo synthesis of vitamin b <dig>  occurs via a complex biochemical pathway involving more than  <dig> enzyme-mediated steps  <cit> . therefore, many organisms do not use cobalamin as a coenzyme, and neither synthesize nor require the vitamin in their metabolism. interestingly, only certain eubacteria and archaea synthesize cobalamin, and the pathway apparently never made the transition to eukaryotes  <cit> . although they are genetically distinct, two related pathways are involved in cobalamin biosynthesis in prokaryotes: the aerobic and anaerobic pathways  <cit> . the aerobic pathway requires molecular oxygen and is characterized by the comparatively late chelation of cobalt into the corrin ring  <cit> . in contrast, the anaerobic pathway does not require molecular oxygen, and the cobalt is inserted at an early synthetic stage  <cit> . for example, the pathway in pseudomonas denitrificans, an aerobe, incorporates molecular oxygen into the precorrin- <dig> macrocycle as a prerequisite to ring contraction, and hence is classified as an aerobic pathway. the pathway in salmonella typhimurium synthesizes cobalamin only in the absence of molecular oxygen. this pathway utilizes cobalt ion chelated into precorrin- <dig>  to set the stage for ring contraction, and hence is classified as anaerobic. the biosynthesis of precorrin- <dig> is common to both the aerobic and anaerobic pathways. at this stage, the two pathways divide, rejoining only after the synthesis of cobyrinate a,c diamide   <cit> .

the intermediate steps of the aerobic biosynthetic pathway, from uroporphyrinogen iii  to adenosylcobalamin, have been elucidated by the over-expression of the cob genes from p. denitrificans , and the related assignments of the functions of the encoded enzymes, based on their catalytic activities. the detailed intermediate mechanisms of the anaerobic pathway for cobalamin biosynthesis are progressively emerging, through combinations of molecular genetic, biochemical and three-dimensional structural studies. the cbi genes involved in the biosynthesis of cobalamin by the anaerobic pathway have been over-expressed from not only s. typhimurium but also bacillus megaterium <cit> , propionibacterium freudenreichi   <cit>  and methanocaldococcus jannaschii <cit> .

the functions of cbia, -b, -c, -d, -e, -f, -g, -h, -j, -k, -l, -p, and -t in the anaerobic pathway were assigned, mainly based on the sequence similarity to their counterparts in the corresponding, well characterized aerobic pathway of p. denitrificans . experimental evidence for the functions of cbib, -h, -k, and –l, and for those of cbia, -d, -f, -g, and –t, among the  <dig> catalytic cbi proteins, was also recently reported  <cit> . however, only the crystal structures of cbic  <cit> , cbif  <cit> , cbik  <cit> , cbil  <cit>  and cbit  <cit>  have been solved.

in the aerobic pathway, the enzyme cobl catalyzes the methylations at c- <dig> and c- <dig>  and the decarboxylation of the c- <dig> acetate side chain of precorrin-6b. in contrast, in the anaerobic system, the functions of cobl are shared by two separate enzymes, cbie and cbit. based on the sequence similarity, it has long been assumed that cbie and cbit are the methyltransferase and the decarboxylase, respectively: cbie catalyzes the addition of the two methyl groups to cobalt-precorrin-6b, and cbit then decarboxylates the c- <dig> acetate side chain to afford cobalt-precorrin  <dig>  however, recent studies based on structural  <cit>  and biochemical analyses revealed that cbit possesses both the decarboxylase and methyltransferase activities; i.e., cbit alone can catalyze both the methylation at c- <dig> and the decarboxylation of the c- <dig> acetate side chain, even in the absence of c- <dig> methylation  <cit> .

the sequence analysis of the hypothetical protein mj <dig>  from m. jannaschii , suggested that it is closely related to mt0146/cbit, with 33% sequence identity. our crystal structure analysis of mj <dig>  determined by the multiple anomalous dispersion  method, suggested that mj <dig> may possess the putative dual functional activities of decarboxylation and methyltransfer in the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway.

RESULTS
overall structure of mj0391
the overall tertiary structure of the mj <dig> protein possesses the rossmann-like “adomet-dependent methyltransferase” fold, comprising seven β-strands . a long flexible stretch with a non-specific secondary structure conformation is observed at the n-terminal region, met <dig> – thr <dig>  the methyltransferase fold is very similar to a canonical rossmann fold, but it includes an antiparallel strand  between the parallel strands, β <dig> and β <dig>  at the c-terminal region. furthermore, this fold is modified by the extension of the β <dig> strand, which forms a long irregular β hairpin with the β <dig> and β <dig> strands . the canonical class i rossmann-like methyltransferase fold consists of a central twisted seven-stranded β-sheet , flanked by two bundles of helices on both sides. all of the strands are parallel except for the β <dig> strand, which is antiparallel to the other strands. since the structure of mj <dig> is quite similar to that of mt0146/cbit  <cit> , the same nomenclature has been used for its description.

oligomeric structure
the asymmetric unit contains two mj <dig> molecules . the two subunits are stabilized by the formation of intermolecular antiparallel β-sheets between β <dig> and β6’ . the crystal packing analysis revealed that the mj <dig> protein forms an intact tetramer  through the crystallographic 2-fold axis . each subunit of the tetramer contributes approximately  <dig> intermolecular electrostatic interactions to facilitate tetramerization . in addition to these direct intermolecular interactions, several indirect hydrogen bond interactions are also formed through buried water molecules at the tetramer interface. the long, irregular β-hairpin, which is formed between the β <dig> and β7/β <dig> strands, plays a critical role in the tetramer formation  region). the tetramerization occurs due to the contributions of the th regions of each subunit, a-d. the th region of subunit a forms intermolecular interactions with subunits b and c . the β <dig> strand of subunit a forms an antiparallel sheet with β6’ of subunit b , while the region connecting the β <dig> and β <dig> of subunit a strands forms intermolecular interactions with the corresponding region in subunit c .

an intermolecular twisted β-sheet is formed between β <dig> and β6’ of subunits a and b, respectively. the residues ala <dig>  asn <dig>  phe <dig>  ser <dig>  and ala <dig> within β <dig> of subunit a contribute intermolecular main-chain hydrogen bond interactions with the residues ala <dig>  ser <dig>  phe <dig>  asn <dig>  and ala <dig> of subunit b, respectively . moreover, the residues his <dig> and ala <dig> of subunit a, which are located in β <dig>  form main-chain hydrogen bonds with leu <dig>  and ala <dig> , respectively, of subunit c.

the α <dig> helix also contacts the corresponding helix of its dimer counterpart. the subunit a residues glu <dig> and glu <dig> form potential salt links with lys <dig> of subunit b. an additional salt link is also observed between lys <dig> of subunit a and glu <dig> of subunit b . the α <dig> helix of subunit a potentially interacts with subunits b, c and d . in subunit a, glu <dig> electrostatically interacts with his <dig> and asn <dig> of subunits c and d, respectively, while asn <dig> of subunit a forms a salt-link with glu <dig> of subunit d. moreover, the glu <dig> residue of subunit a also electrostatically interacts with lys <dig> and his <dig> of subunit b. besides these electrostatic interactions, about  <dig> residues of subunit a contribute substantial hydrophobic interactions toward tetramer formation . the homologous protein mt0146/cbit forms a tetramer in the crystal structure and in solution  <cit> . the buried surface area per monomer within the intact tetramer is about  <dig>  Å <dig> , as calculated by the program surface in the ccp <dig> suite. since the overall tetramer arrangement in the mj <dig> structure is very similar to that found in mt0146/cbit, we speculate that in solution, mj <dig> may also form a tetramer that is functionally important for its biological activity.

comparison with homologous structures
a dali  <cit>  search revealed that although mj <dig> shares less sequence similarity with mt0146/cbit from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum , the precorrin-6y c <dig>  c <dig> – methyltransferase from geobacter metallireducens gs- <dig> , and the putative precorrin-6y c <dig>  c <dig> – methyltransferase from corynebacterium diphtheriae  , the overall tertiary structures and the quaternary structure arrangements are essentially conserved between them. the superimposition of the mj <dig> structure onto the structures of mt0146/cbit , q39yf <dig> , and q6nha <dig>  yielded r.m.s.d. values of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  Å, respectively, for all cα atoms . recently, the crystal structure of the c-terminal region of cobl  from rhodobacter capsulatus was reported  <cit> . the enzyme cobl, which uses precorrin-6b as a substrate, promotes the decarboxylation of the acetic acid side chain at c <dig>  and the methylation at the c <dig> & c <dig> meso positions, to produce precorrin-8x. the superimposition of mj <dig> onto the coblc structure  yielded z-score and r.m.s.d. values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively, for  <dig> cα atoms .

as expected, the dali search with mj <dig> also identified proteins belonging to the methyltransferase family. for example, mj <dig> is structurally homologous to m1a <dig> trna methyltransferase, trmi , m5u <dig> 23s rrna methyltransferase, rlmd , catechol o-methyltransferase, comt , and rrna dimethyladenosine transferase, dim <dig> .

comparison with mt0146/cbit
although the overall tertiary structures of the mj <dig> and mt0146/cbit proteins are essentially similar, striking differences exist in the th region, an important element for forming the tetrameric arrangements . the dihedral angles at the equivalent positions of lys <dig>  and ala <dig>  in mj <dig> and mt0146/cbit, respectively, trigger large deviations in their respective th elements. moreover, the β <dig> & β <dig> strands in mj <dig> are connected by a type ii β-turn. the type ii conformation is produced by incorporating pro <dig> at the i+ <dig> position. the β-turn is stabilized by an intra-hydrogen bond between the carbonyl-group of ile <dig>  and the amino-group of gly <dig> . in contrast, in mt0146/cbit, β <dig> and β <dig> are connected by a relatively long loop, comprising six amino acids. the abovementioned structural deviations cause the maximum r.m.s.d value of  <dig>  Å between the cα position of pro <dig> in mj <dig> and that of asp <dig> in mt <dig>  the α <dig> helix also participates in tetrameric interactions ; however, less structural deviation is observed between the corresponding regions of mj <dig> and mt0146/cbit. in addition, deviations were observed in the non-specific secondary structure regions, such as the n-terminal region and the loops connecting the secondary structural elements .

a comparison of the apo-form mj <dig> to the mt0146/cbit complexed with adohcy   <cit>  revealed that the co-factor binding site regions are similar in both structures . hence, we predict that the mj <dig> protein may also recognize the cofactor adomet in a similar manner as in mt0146/cbit. the shallow binding pocket is produced by the head regions of β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig>  which line the middle of the pocket. the pocket is surrounded by the α <dig> and α <dig> helices on one side, and the α <dig> and α <dig> helices on the other side . the residues within the loops connecting β <dig> and α <dig>  β <dig> and α <dig>  β <dig> and α <dig>  β <dig> and α <dig> and in the n-terminal flexible region may potentially form interactions with the adohcy molecule. the adohcy interacting residues are nearly conserved between these proteins, except for the residues arg <dig>  tyr <dig>  lys <dig> and asn <dig>  which are replaced by asp <dig>  arg <dig>  gly <dig> and glu <dig>  respectively, in mt0146/cbit. these loops are quite flexible, as observed in figure 4a, and thus we speculate that they may undergo conformational changes upon binding to the adohcy/adomet molecule.

near the adomet binding site, a deep groove is formed by segments from the rossmann-like methyltransferase core and the th region  . keller et al.  <cit>  suggested that this deep groove is a putative binding pocket for the precorrin molecule. surface potential analyses revealed that the mj <dig> protein is highly basic  , whereas its homologous protein, mt0146/cbit, is highly acidic . although the electrostatic charge distributions are quite different between these two proteins, the charge distributions within the putative precorrin binding pocket are highly conserved between them . the residues pro <dig>  arg <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig> and asn <dig> are located near the binding pocket in mj <dig>  the equivalent corresponding residues in mt0146/cbit are pro <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig> and asn <dig>  respectively . recent studies of s. typhimurium cbit revealed that cbit alone can catalyze both the methylation at c <dig> and decarboxylation of the c <dig> acetate side chain, even in the absence of c <dig> methylation  <cit> . since mj <dig> is structurally highly homologous to the known cbit proteins, and the functional residues are conserved between them, we speculate that mj <dig> may also possess the dual roles of methylation and decarboxylation to form the intermediate, cobalt-precorrin  <dig>  in the vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis pathway. however, further biochemical and crystallographic studies are required to understand the enzymatic mechanism of mj <dig> in cobalamin synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of the hypothetical protein mj <dig>  from m. jannaschii, was determined by the mad procedure, which revealed the presence of a rossmann-like “adomet-dependent methyltransferase” fold. the tertiary and quaternary structures of mj <dig> are essentially similar to those of the cbit or coblc proteins from m. thermoautotrophicum, g. metallireducens, and r. capsulatus. moreover, the functional residues in the putative precorrin binding pocket are highly conserved. hence, based on structural comparison studies, we speculate that the mj <dig> protein may possess the putative dual c15-methyltransferase and c12-decarboxylase activities in the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway.
