BACKGROUND
sulfur is an essential trace element for all organisms, and is widely used in biochemical processes. many enzymes and antioxidant molecules such as glutathione contains sulfur. organically bonded sulfur is a component of all proteins, in the amino acids cysteine and methionine. generally, sulfate is the most stable form of sulfur. the available pools of sulfate can vary significantly as environmental conditions change. most organisms have a limited capacity to store sulfur, and thus require different strategies to optimize sulfur use for survival. the ability of microbes to acclimate to periods of nutrient insufficiency is essential to their survival in the natural environment  <cit> . the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an ideal model organism for the study of many metabolic processes including response to sulfur-deprivation. sulfur-deprived chlamydomonas cells have been used for microarray-based rna abundance studies  <cit> , rna-seq analysis  <cit> , determination of metabolite profiles  <cit> , and sustained production of h <dig>  <cit> . chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibits several responses to sulfur deprivation, including changes of the photosynthetic apparatus, the synthesis of enzymes, cell wall structure, so42- transport activity, and cell size  <cit> .

recently, there has been considerable interest in understanding the impacts of sulfur deprivation on mirna. mirnas were first found in caenorhabditis elegans through forward genetic screens of the lin- <dig> and let- <dig> mutants  <cit> . since then, genetic studies on various organisms have revealed that mirnas are universally present and are key components of various gene regulatory pathways in eukaryotes. chlamydomonas mirnas were discovered independently by two groups  <cit> , showing that mirnas exist not only in multicellular systems but also in unicellular eukaryotes. experimental approaches and bioinformatics-assisted screening have identified approximately  <dig> chlamydomonas reinhardtii mirnas, which are listed in the mirbase version <dig>  http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/s-equences/index.shtml. to investigate the role of chlamydomonas reinhardtii mirnas involved in sulfur deprivation, we used a deep sequencing platform to extensively profile and identify changes in the mirnas expression that occur during sulfur-replete and sulfur-deprived conditions.

RESULTS
the small rna profile of chlamydomonas reinhardtii in both sulfur-replete and sulfur-deprived conditions
the equal numbers of algal cells were resuspended under continuous illumination for up to  <dig> h in tap  or tap-s . two small rna libraries were constructed using the algal cells under sulphur-replete  and with sulfur-deprived conditions  respectively. sequencing of the chlamydomonas reinhardtii small rna libraries was performed with solexa high-throughput sequencing. we obtained  <dig> , <dig> reads from the sulfur-deprived  library and  <dig> , <dig> reads from the sulfur-replete  library. after discarding low quality and shorter than  <dig>  sequences,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt were collected . the majority of the small rna sequences obtained from the -s and + s libraries were 20- <dig> nt in size, which was the typical size range for dicer derived products . comparing the common small rnas sequences between -s and + s libraries, although the total small rnas sequences in both libraries reached  <dig> %, the common categories of unique small rnas were only  <dig> %. it indicates that sulfur-deprivation led to a significant influence on the small rna expression patterns in chlamydomonas reinhardtii .

total reads: total sequenced reads; high quality: number of high quality reads with no n, no more than  <dig> bases whose quality score is lower than  <dig> and no more than  <dig> bases whose quality is lower than 13; adaptor <dig> null: number of reads with no 3' adaptor; insert null: number of reads with no insertion; adaptor <dig> contaminants: number of 5' contaminants; smaller than  <dig> nt: number of reads less than  <dig> nt. generally, small rna tags are between  <dig> ~  <dig> nt long. so too short tags should be removed from data for future analysis; polya: number of reads wih polya; clean reads: number of clean reads after adaptors and contaminants are removed which are used in the following analysis.

the 20- <dig> nt sequences from the + s and -s libraries were aligned to the draft chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome using soap  <cit> . a total of  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  sequences were found to match the genome perfectly . these small rnas were used for further analysis. with the alignment to genbank, rfam, exon and intron, the composition of small rnas were annotated as sirna, mirna, snrna, snorna etc. . among all the categories of small rnas, sirnas expression  did not change on sulfur deprivation. however, the micrornas expression showed more significant up-regulation in response to sulfur-deprivation .

identifying novel potential mirnas in chlamydomonas reinhardtii
to date, mirbase had a collection of  <dig> chlamydomonas mirna. the characteristic hairpin structure of mirna precursor can be used to predict novel mirna. we used the predictive software mireap to predict novel mirnas by exploring their secondary structures, and the minimum free energy of the unannotated small rna tags which could be mapped to the genome. we predicted  <dig> novel mirnas by solexa sequencing and mireap predictive software in chlamydomonas reinhardtii. some of the novel potential mirnas  have more than ten thousand reads but were not detected by former research  <cit> . these results showed that high-throughput sequencing of small rnas is also an ideal strategy to analyze small rnas profiles and identify novel potential mirnas in chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

differential expression of chlamydomonas reinhardtii mirnas in sulfur-deprived and sulphur-replete conditions
in order to detect the effect of sulfur-deprivation on chlamydomonas reinhardtii mirnas, the expression abundance of  <dig> candidate mirnas  in both -s and + s libraries was examined. overall, approximately 15%  of mirnas showed significant changes in expression  upon sulfur-deprivation. among these mirna with altered expression,  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> predicted mirnas were up-regulated with  <dig> mirnas being -s library specific .

to confirm the expression changes of chlamydomonas mirnas and their response to sulfur-deprived stress, we used quantitative rt-pcr analysis to validate the results of the high throughput sequencing. fourteen mirnas, which included  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel predicted mirnas, were selected at random. the quantitative rt-pcr experimental results of  <dig> mirnas matched these of high throughput sequencing data . however,  <dig> of the chosen mirnas did not show the matched results. we deduce that this was likely due to the low quality of primers  <cit>  or low abundance of mirnas, and further research is needed for this problem.

target predictions of chlamydomonas reinhardtii mirnas involved sulfur-deprivation
the target genes of chlamydomonas. reinhardtii mirnas were predicted by a web-base integrated system, web micrornas designer  <dig> http://wmd <dig> weigelworld.org/cgi-bin/webapp.cgi. the  <dig> mirna, which showed differential expressions  to sulfur-deprivation were screened for target predictions. we divided the predicted target genes into different group according to their putative functions including photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, lipid metabolism and other processes. we analyzed the differential expression correlation between the mirna and the target genes  <cit>  in response to sulfur-deprivation; consequently, we confirmed  <dig> mirnas and the target genes involved in response to sulfur-deprivation in chlamydomonas reinhardtii .

discussion
the reliability of the method to identify chlamydomonas mirna
mirnas are a group of small non-coding rnas that play an important role in various developmental and stress response processes through negative control of gene expression  <cit> . mirna identification had been reported in chlamydomonas reinhardtii  <cit> , but only  <dig> mirnas were annotated and collected to mirbase in previous studies. in this study we characterized a total of  <dig> chlamydomonas reinhardtii mirnas which included the  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas by using solexa sequencing technology with prediction software mireap. we found that most known mirnas were abundant, and that the  <dig> novel mirnas were less abundant or specific to the mirna of -s library. it further confirmed solexa sequencing technology as a high-throughput sequencing system, which was able to produce highly accurate, reproducible and quantitative readouts of small rnas  <cit> .

the chlamydomonas mirnas expression patterns for responding to sulfur-deprivation
the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been used as a model organism for studying the responses of eukaryotes to sulfur-deprivation  <cit> . the completion of chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome sequencing and substantially expressed sequence tag  project has greatly increased its utility as a model system  <cit> . although some studies have been carried out on chlamydomonas mirnas regulation  <cit> , this is the first report on the mirnas which responded to sulphur-deprivation stress in chlamydomonas reinhardtii. by comparing the expression levels of two mirnas libraries, we found that approximately 15% of mirnas expressions showed evident changes  with sulfur deprivation . these results further indicate that sulfur-responsive processes are complicated and need a lot of mirnas to participate in the regulation of gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels  <cit> . interestingly, although most mirna which were reported by several groups  <cit>  were found in this study, we found that no chlamydomonas mirnas have identifiable orthologs with mir395s. mir395s play a very important roles in the sulfur-deprived response in higher plants  <cit>  where mir <dig> regulates sulfate distribution and metabolism in the plant cells. further, mir <dig> targets a low-affinity sulfate transporter ast <dig>  and  <dig> enzymes in the sulfate assimilation pathway ,  and ]  <cit> . the highly conserved mir <dig> and the presence of multiple copies of mir <dig> in diverse plant species is necessary for sulfur homeostasis. the lack of a universally conserved mir395s family in chlamydomonas reinhardtii suggests that green algae mirnas may have a different pathway for responding to sulfur-deprivation than higher plants.

target genes of chlamydomonas mirnas involved in sulfur-deprivation
mirnas negatively regulated their targets by cleavage-induced degradation, and the effects of mirnas over expression were thus often reflected in decreased mrna levels of the target gene  <cit> . although we found the differential expression of multitudinous chlamydomonas mirna between sulfur-replete and sulfur-deprived conditions, it is difficult to confirm their target genes because of the complex mechanism of interaction between mirnas and their target transcripts was not determined. zhao et al  selected the precursor of mirna cre-mir <dig> as backbone to design amirnas silencing the maa <dig> and rbcs <dig> genes  <cit> . attila et al  selected the precursor of mirna cre-mir  <dig> as a backbone to efficiently produce amirnas targeting cox <dig>  psy and dcl <dig> genes  <cit> . james et al  also used amirnas silencing hyda <dig>  hyda <dig>  and hyd <dig> genes  <cit> . this far we have not found the specific bioinformatics tools to predict chlamydomonas mirnas targets, so we chose the web-base integrated system  to predict chlamydomonas mirnas involved in sulfur-deprivation. the predicted results contained false positive rates similar to other reports on mirna target prediction  <cit> , so it was necessary to verify these predicted targets. however, it was more difficult to screen the mirnas targets without the 3' utr sequence database and abundance information of mrna expression for response to sulfur-deprivation because most mirna targeted the 3' utr of mrna and expression abundances showed the negative correlative between mirna and their target mrna. fortunately, the chlamydomonas reinhardtii trancriptome was characterized from sulfur-replete and sulfur-depleted conditions  <cit> , which provided very important information to analyze the interaction between mirna and its target mrna. theoretically, with the sulfur-deprivation stress, the amount of related mrnas expression will increased, the transcription levels of its target genes should be decreased by mirna-mediated gene silencing. in fact, we found that expression abundances of most mirnas showed a negative correlation with their levels of target mrna under sulfur-deprivation among  <dig> mirnas which regulated the metabolic activities . interestingly, the four target genes which encoded low phosphate bleaching protein , 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase , decarboxylating amino acid transporter and serine/threonine protein kinase were up-regulated while the expressions of the their mirna including n <dig>  mir <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> were up. lpb is important for acclimation of chlamydomonas reinhardtii to phosphorus and sulfur deprivation  <cit> . 6-pgdh is the first enzyme for pentose phosphate pathway , which is common for plant responses to abiotic stresses, and serine/threonine protein kinase is required for acclimation of the alga to sulfur deprivation  <cit> . these four genes are important for chlamydomonas reinhardtii to survive under sulfur-deprivation, so their mirna should be down regulated when the algal cell is stressed by sulfur deprivation. however, our results from high-throughput sequencing demonstrate that their regulated mirnas are increased with sulfur deprivation. these results may indicate that the expression of the  <dig> genes are regulated by multiple factor, the mirna regulation may not be the major force. further experiments are needed to verify this hypothesis.

we were particularly interested in the relative mirna and its targets for hydrogen bioproduction. the differential expression profile of chlamydomonas mirnas led to massive changes in gene expression and metabolism which was closely associated with h <dig> photo-production. several mirnas targeted to genes involved photosynthesis created an anaerobic environment and induced the activity of hydrogenase. the target gene of mir <dig>  encoded the pg phosphate synthase protein. pg is synthesized from cytidyldiphosphate -diacylglycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate by the catalytic action of pg-phosphate synthase. being the only phospholipid in cyanobacteria, pg was required for the accumulation of chlorophyll-protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane and for the normal functioning of photosystem ii   <cit> . in the absence of o <dig>  in order to generate atp, green algae resorted to anaerobic photosynthetic metabolism by mirna regulation and evolved h <dig> in the light and consumed endogenous substrates.

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed a deep-sequencing analysis of mirnas in chlamydomonas reinhardtii and provided a genome-wide, quantitative view of how sulfur-deprivation impacts the expression of small rnas in chlamydomonas reinhardtii. our data confirm  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> predicted mirnas with altered expression under sulfur-deprivation, most of which were up-regulated and  <dig> were -s library specific. target predictions revealed that a variety of metabolic processes may be affected by changing the expression of mirnas. our study has delivered new insights into the role of mirnas involved in sulfur-deprivation and provided a new approach to understand the biohydrogen production from the small rna level in chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
