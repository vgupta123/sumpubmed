BACKGROUND
numerous studies have demonstrated that non-coding rnas  are widely expressed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . furthermore, the number of ncrnas substantially increases with the complexity of the organism, whereas the number of protein-coding genes remains relatively static. in bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, and invertebrates, the coding sequences constitute approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and 20% of the genomic dna, respectively. in mammals, open-reading frames only account for approximately 1–2% of the genomes  <cit> .

ncrnas include highly abundant and functionally important rnas, such as transfer rna  and ribosomal rna , as well as other small, stable rnas, such as small nuclear rnas , small nucleolar rnas , rnase p and mitochondrial rna processing  rna, signal recognition particle  rna, and telomerase rna. these rnas have been characterised and are involved in splicing, ribosome biogenesis, translation, and chromosome replication  <cit> . recent transcriptomic and bioinformatic studies have also identified an increasing number of new ncrnas whose function has not been validated  <cit> . hence, the discovery and analysis of ncrnas has become an important step in our understanding of genomic structure and will expand our knowledge of the function and the regulatory roles of ncrnas in the cell cycle and development.

in recent years, ncrnas have been identified using experimental methods and computational predictions in several fungi  <cit> . a large number of non-coding rna genes, including  <dig> box c/d snorna genes, have been predicted in the genome of schizosaccharomyces pombe. functional analyses of  <dig> box h/aca snornas indicated that the snornas evolved in coordination with rrnas to preserve post-transcriptional modification sites among distant eukaryotes  <cit> . a comparative genomics analysis of seven different yeast species identified a substantial number of evolutionarily conserved, structured ncrnas, suggesting their roles in post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> . ncrnas that participate in the cleavage and processing of trnas were observed in aspergillus fumigatus <cit> . an extensive analysis of snorna genes from neurospora crassa indicated a high diversity of post-transcriptional modification guided by snornas in the fungus kingdom  <cit> . thus far, the ncrnas of dermatophytes have not been studied.

trichophyton rubrum is the most common dermatophyte that can infect human keratinised tissue   <cit> . t. rubrum has a  <dig> -mbp haploid nuclear genome consisting of five chromosomes that range in size from  <dig> – <dig>  mbp and a 27-kbp circular mitochondrial genome  <cit> . the broad institute has sequenced the t. rubrum genome and predicted more than  <dig>  protein-coding genes. however, apart from rrnas and trnas, no other ncrnas have been annotated and characterised within the t. rubrum genome  <cit> . in the present study, we constructed an ncrna library  and identified ncrnas in t. rubrum using an rna-seq method. a total of  <dig> ncrna candidates were characterised, including  <dig> entirely novel ncrnas and  <dig> known ncrnas. we also analysed the sequence conservation, and genomic location of these ncrnas in six other dermatophytes. our results may guide further studies of the important roles of ncrna in t. rubrum and provide important complementary information to the annotation of the t. rubrum genome.

RESULTS
identification of ncrna candidates in t. rubrum
to obtain a global view of ncrnas in t. rubrum, we extracted total rna from the conidia and mycelia phases and generated a small rna cdna library with size-fractionated total rna ranging in size from 70–500 bp. after sequencing on the 454/roche sequencing platform, a total of  <dig>  reads were obtained and mapped to the t. rubrum genome. next, the reads that mapped to the same genomic loci were clustered, resulting in  <dig>  unique contigs. after removing the coding rna and matches to trnas and rrnas, the remaining  <dig> clusters  were considered ncrna candidates. of these candidates,  <dig> were predicted to align with rfam sequences and the remaining  <dig> were novel ncrna candidates .

characteristics of ncrna candidates
of the  <dig> identified ncrna candidates,  <dig> mapped to loci within 1 kb of the closest coding gene, implying a possible functional relationship. some of the ncrna clusters located in the immediate vicinity of a protein-coding region might be processed from the 5′- or 3′-utr of the corresponding mrna. among the  <dig> ncrna clusters,  <dig> were intronic and  <dig> corresponded to non-annotated intergenic regions of the t. rubrum genome . to verify the expression and sizes of candidate ncrnas, we selected the spliceosomal snrnas u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> and  <dig> randomly selected novel ncrna candidates to use in northern hybridisation. the results are shown in figure  <dig> 

snrna candidates
the spliceosome contains five essential small nuclear rnas —u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u6—that are essential components for assembling the spliceosome and accomplishing the intricate task of intron removal from newly synthesised eukaryotic rnas  <cit> . here, we identified the genomic loci of snrnas u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig>  each of which exhibited a unique genomic location. u <dig> and u <dig> were the most abundant snrnas among our data, found in  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads, respectively. the expression of u <dig> and u <dig> was lower than the other snrna candidates; we found only  <dig> reads of u <dig> and  <dig> reads of u <dig>  these results are in agreement with those of the small ncrna transcriptome analysis of another filamentous fungus, a. fumigatus <cit> . u <dig> was not initially identified in our data. to find the u <dig> genomic locus in t. rubrum, we downloaded the u <dig> sequences of a. fumigatus, a. oryzae, and a. niger from rfam to use as query sequences to search for homologues in the t. rubrum genome using blastn. one genomic locus was identified. corresponding reads assigned to the same locus had been sequenced and clustered in our data but had been eliminated because the percentage of orf in the cluster was greater than 80%.

we aligned the t. rubrum snrna u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> candidates to the genomes of six t. rubrum-related dermatophytes to predict the homologues in these genomes by blastn. the homologues were compared using the multiple sequence alignment software clustalw <dig>  revealing that all snrnas were highly conserved in these seven dermatophytes . high variance was observed among the sequences and lengths of these snrnas in t. rubrum and their homologues in other fungi; however, these snrnas were conserved at the secondary structure level, with conserved regions in the hairpin loops . these results correspond with previous reports on a. fumigatus <cit> .

snornas
in eukaryotic cells, two major classes of small nucleolar ncrna  have been identified: c/d box snornas, which are involved in the 20-o-methylation of ribosomal, spliceosomal, and transfer rnas , and h/aca snornas, which guide pseudouridylation in these rna species  <cit> .

to predict the two classes of snornas and their putative targets in our data, we used the snoscan and snogps programs, defining the potential target sequences as the  <dig> s, 18s, and 25s rrnas of t. rubrum and all snrnas identified in our data  <cit> . we identified  <dig> snornas, including 58c/d box snornas  and 38h/aca snornas . we identified 37c/d box snornas as putative targets, most of which were predicted to guide methylation of 18s and 25s rrnas. we also identified five c/d box snornas  that were predicted to guide the methylation of snrnas u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig>  of the 37c/d box snornas,  <dig> had different modification sites in target rrna or snrna sequences. no rrna or snrna targets were identified in the remaining 21c/d box snornas . additionally, the  <dig> identified h/aca box snornas were identified as guiding the pseudouridylation of  <dig> sites in rrnas , whereas no pseudouridine sites were predicted on any snrnas.

other types of ncrna in t. rubrum
we also identified  <dig> other ncrna genomic loci, such as pri-mirnas or pre-mirnas, rnase mrp, and telomerase rna. mirnas related transcriptional loci were the most widely distributed ncrnas in the t. rubrum genome; for example, the mir- <dig> mirna family had  <dig> transcriptional regions and mir- <dig> had eight. in our data, these mirna homologies of ncrnas, which varied from 70–270 bp, were much longer than the lengths of mature mirnas , they may be pri- or pre-mirnas candidates.

evolutionary conservation of the ncrnas in t. rubrum
to analyse the evolutionary conservation of ncrnas in t. rubrum, we used blastn to align the sequences of all  <dig> ncrnas to the genomes of six related dermatophytes: t. equinum, t. tonsurans, t. verrucosum, a. benhamiae, m. gypseum, and m. canis. the loci of  <dig> of these sncrnas were also identified in all six genomes . we found that the sequences of these sncrnas were highly conserved, with sequence identities above 85%. of the  <dig> ncrnas, ten had no hits in other genomes and might be specifically expressed in t. rubrum . to further analyse the conserved ncrnas in dermatophytes, we employed blastn to align all of the sncrnas with the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide database  after excluding arthrodermataceae. these blastn results were processed by megan <dig>  which placed each ncrna sequence in a node in the ncbi taxonomy  <cit> .

as shown in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig> ncrna sequences were classified under cellular organisms, with  <dig> clustered to the eukaryota node . of these ncrnas,  <dig> were assigned to fungi, indicating that these ncrnas were conserved in fungi; all snrnas were assigned to this node. of the ncrnas under the fungi taxonomic level,  <dig> and  <dig> were assigned to onygenales and trichocomaceae, respectively, supporting the close relationship between the dermatophytes and the fungi in these families. seventy-three ncrnas were assigned to phyla distantly related to fungi, including three assigned to the root, seven to cellular organisms,  <dig> to the eukaryota node,  <dig> under bilateria, and six under bacteria. these results suggest that some ancient ncrnas are preserved in t. rubrum.

apart from the classified ncrnas, the remaining  <dig> ncrna candidates had no significant similarity to any nucleotide sequence in nt, including  <dig> unassigned ncrnas and  <dig> ncrnas with no hits. of these unclassified ncrnas,  <dig> existed in and were conserved in all six dermatophytes, indicating that these  <dig> ncrnas were dermatophyte-specific ncrnas .

discussion
rna is emerging as a central player in cellular regulation, with active roles in multiple regulatory layers, including transcription, rna maturation, rna modification, and translational regulation  <cit> . recent studies have revealed an unexpected complexity of regulatory rnas, even in bacteria  <cit> . in the present study, we first used an rna-seq method to analyse the ncrnas in the genome of the dermatophyte fungus t. rubrum. we identified  <dig> sncrna candidates, including snrnas, snornas, mirnas, and other types of ncrnas;  <dig> novel ncrnas were predicted. we further confirmed the genomic loci of these ncrnas in t. rubrum. this work provides an important complement to the current annotation of the t. rubrum genome, which is currently comprised primarily of protein-coding genes.

five types of snrnas  were identified, and their secondary structures were predicted by rnafold  <cit> . we found these snrnas to be highly conserved among dermatophytes. we also detected  <dig> snornas, including  <dig> that were annotated in other organisms and  <dig> that were novel snornas. using the snoscan and snogps programs, we bioinformatically identified their potential target sites on rrnas and snrnas. mirnas have been previously reported in some fungi, such as s. pombe, but have not been found in a. fumigatus <cit> . in our data, we detected  <dig> genomic loci corresponding to  <dig> mirna families; the lengths of these ncrnas varied from 80–270 bp, suggesting that they were pri-mirnas or pre-mirnas  <cit> . to analyse the evolutionary conservation of ncrnas, we aligned the  <dig> snrnas to six other dermatophyte genomes and the nt database; we found  <dig> dermatophyte-specific ncrnas and 11 t. rubrum-specific ncrnas.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, sequences for ncrnas were obtained in t.rubrum and characterized by sequence comparison to know ncrnas in other organisms, some of which were presumably functionally characterized in other work. this will prove to be a valuable resource but real understanding of regulatory mechanisms will come from followon work from this strong beginning.
