BACKGROUND
one of the most commonly encountered opportunistic microorganisms in humans is candida albicans, a ubiquitous fungus that is a part of the normal microbial flora found on mucosal surfaces such as those of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina in human beings and domestic animals
 <cit> . this yeast is the most common cause of mucosal and invasive fungal infections observed in humans
 <cit> . host protection against c. albicans infection is complex and includes different subsets of the immune defense system
 <cit> .

during the development of oropharyngeal candidiasis , candida adheres to and invades the tissue. the adhesion of this yeast to host tissue is the initial phase of a potential infection that enables microorganisms to survive inside the host and eventually colonize host tissues during the onset of candidiasis
 <cit> . following this irreversible attachment, fungal cells proliferate and optimally interact to ensure their sustainability in the imposed environment. after the proliferative phase comes the production and deposition of a thick extracellular matrix  that procures chemical as well as physical protection for cells
 <cit> .

c. albicans adhesion and growth leading to biofilm formation are mediated by various genes such as hwp <dig> and eap <dig> that encode well-characterized class of cell wall proteins that house a glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchorage motif in their c–terminal domains and a signal peptide at their n-termini. these c- and n-terminal domains mediate the adherence of c. albicans to various surfaces
 <cit> . hwp <dig>  a hyphal-specific adhesion gene encodes the hyphal cell wall protein, and both are essential for biofilm formation
 <cit> . the involvement of hwp <dig> in c. albicans adhesion can be supported by the eap <dig> gene which encodes a glucan-cross-linked cell wall protein  and mediates the adhesion of c. albicans to different surfaces, including epithelial cells and polystyrene
 <cit> . similar to other genes, hwp <dig> and eap <dig> are downstream effectors of efg <dig> <cit> , a transcription regulator
 <cit> . the efg <dig> mutant strain has been shown to exhibit defects in growth, biofilm formation, and virulence
 <cit> .

c. albicans virulence is also mediated by proteolytic enzymes such as secreted aspartyl proteinases 
 <cit> . the contribution of saps to mucosal and systemic infections and their involvement in adherence, tissue damage, and evasion of host immune responses has been reported, showing the implication of the sap <dig> gene in c. albicans growth in protein-containing media
 <cit> . sap <dig> and sap <dig> are expressed during phenotypic switching
 <cit> , while sap <dig>  sap <dig> and sap <dig> are expressed upon hyphal formation
 <cit> . sap <dig> and sap <dig> are involved in the mechanism of adhesion to host cells
 <cit> . this proteolytic enzyme family is therefore involved in c. albicans virulence.

c. albicans infection can be promoted by several factors. candidiasis has been associated with long-term antibiotics intake, aids, leukemia, malignancy, radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, or other risk factors that interfere with immunocompetence
 <cit> .

environmental factors such as smoking may also promote candida infections
 <cit> . tobacco smoke exposure has been shown to promote microbial biofilm formation
 <cit> . specifically, it has been shown that cigarette smoke interferes with s mutans and c. albicans adhesion, resulting in biofilm formation on dental restoration materials
 <cit> , which suggests that cigarette smokers are more susceptible to life-threatening oral infections including candidiasis. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cigarette smoke condensate on c. albicans adhesion, growth, and biofilm formation, and on the activation of several genes involved in the virulence of this yeast.

RESULTS
cigarette smoke condensate promoted c albicans adhesion and growth
c. albicans attachment to the surface of glass slides for  <dig>   <dig>  and 6 h was measured by means of crystal violet staining. as shown in figure 
1c. albicans adhesion was significant  at  <dig> and 6 h of incubation. all of the tested csc concentrations promoted the adhesion of c. albicans. adhesion was related to incubation period, with low adhesion reported at 1 h and high adhesion at 6 h. this result indicates that csc can increase c. albicans adhesion and that this effect can lead to significant c. albicans growth. for this purpose, we investigated the effect of csc on c. albicans growth. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  high c. albicans growth was obtained in the presence of csc, compared to that obtained by the controls. indeed, c. albicans growth significantly  increased with as low as 10% csc. of interest is that the most effective concentrations of csc were between  <dig> and 40%; at these concentrations, c. albicans growth was two to threefold higher than that recorded by the controls. overall data thus demonstrate that cigarette smoke favors c. albicans adhesion and growth.

cigarette smoke condensate promoted c albicans biofilm formation
because csc contributed to increasing c. albicans adhesion and growth, we tested its potential to promote c. albicans biofilm formation. using sem analyses and a crystal violet assay, we were able to demonstrate the stimulatory effect of csc on biofilm formation . sem analyses revealed a high c. albicans density in the csc-treated culture . a high c. albicans density was observed in the scaffold in the presence of 30% csc and this density increased with 50% csc. to confirm these observations, quantitative analyses were conducted using the crystal violet staining method. figure 
3b showed that after  <dig> days of culture, csc was able to significantly  increase biofilm formation. this effect was observed beginning at a concentration of 20% csc, and at 50% csc, biofilm formation was greater than that observed in the controls and at 30% csc.

cigarette smoke condensate modulated hwp <dig>  eap <dig>  and sap <dig> expression
based on the data showing that csc increased c. albicans adhesion, growth, and biofilm formation, we sought to determine whether this took place through the regulation of certain genes. figure 
 <dig> reveals that hwp <dig> gene expression significantly increased following exposure of c. albicans to csc. the activation of this gene significantly  increased according to csc concentration. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  a twofold increase in hwp <dig> gene expression was recorded with a concentration of 30% csc, compared to that observed in the controls, and with 50% csc, this increase was over threefold. similarly, eap <dig> gene, which encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, glucan-cross-linked cell wall protein involved in adhesion and biofilm formation, was also affected by csc treatment. figure 
 <dig> shows that csc significantly increased the expression of the eap <dig> gene and that this increase was dependent on the concentration of csc; the higher the concentration, the greater was the expression of this gene. the sap <dig> gene was also modulated by csc. figure 
 <dig> shows that the csc led to a significant  increase of sap <dig> gene expression. of interest is the increased sap <dig> gene expression with csc concentration. indeed, with 30% csc, a twofold expression was recorded and with 50% csc this expression increased threefold compared to that observed in the controls .

discussion
smoking is known to induce a variety of changes in the oral cavity. cigarette smoke affects both saliva
 <cit>  and oral microorganisms, including c. albicans, a leading cause of oral candidiasis
 <cit> . however, the specific effect of cigarette smoke on c.albicans remains to be elucidated. the first question we addressed in this study was: what is the effect of cigarette smoke on c. albicans adhesion? we demonstrated that csc promoted c. albicans adhesion, which is in agreement with previously reported studies showing a high rate of oral candida carriage in tobacco smokers compared to non-smokers
 <cit> . furthermore, bacteria exposed to csc were shown to adhere more to epithelial cells compared to non-exposed specimens
 <cit> , which supports our data with c. albicans. increased adhesion of c. albicans in the presence of csc may occur due to changes in the interaction of c. albicans with its environment through the expression of high levels of adhesins, as previously suggested
 <cit> . furthermore, it is important to realize that cigarette smoke comprises a high number of individual compounds
 <cit> , including acetaldehyde, benzene,  <dig> -butadiene, and isoprene with an elevated mutagenic potential
 <cit> . thus, it is possible that these compounds may have exerted specific effect on c. albicans adhesion, growth and probably biofilm formation. the effect of cigarette smoke promoting cell adhesion was previously reported by baboni et al.,  showing linear dose response adhesion
 <cit> . the mechanism involved in such effect could involve kinase pathways. these pathways can be promoted by csc compounds at certain concentration, but inhibited when these compounds are high explaining the decrease of c. albicans adhesion/biofilm formation at 40% and 50% of csc. further research is mandatory to shed light on the mechanisms leading to the up-regulation of c. albicans adhesion when exposed to cigarette smoke.

c. albicans adhesion is one of the key events leading to candidiasis
 <cit> . this adhesion is usually followed by overgrowth and invasion
 <cit> . consequently, in promoting c. albicans adhesion, csc may lead to an over-growth of this yeast. our study confirms this hypothesis showing a growth increase of c. albicans in the presence of csc. this concurs with previously published reports showing that smoking can be an important predisposing factor for oral candidiasis
 <cit> , which may be enhanced by cigarette smoke through an increased secretion of histolytic enzymes by c. albicans, thus contributing to its virulence
 <cit> . however, the exact pathogenic influence of smoking has yet to be investigated.

c. albicans adhesion and growth are particularly necessary for biofilm formation
 <cit> . because csc significantly increased c. albicans adhesion and growth in the present study, it is suggested that csc may also promote c. albicans biofilm formation. using appropriate conditions to form biofilms, our findings indicate that csc was indeed capable of promoting biofilm formation. of interest is that a significant increase of biofilm formation was obtained at both tested concentrations, and that this phenomenon was dependent on csc concentration. these useful data are comparable to those of other studies showing increased microbial biofilm formation with cigarette smoke
 <cit> . by showing the significant stimulatory effect on increasing c. albicans biofilm formation, cigarette smoke can thus be labeled as an infection-promoting agent.

promoting c. albicans adhesion, growth, and biofilm formation may operate through the modulated expression of certain c. albicans genes
 <cit> , as supported by our study demonstrating that csc led to a high expression of the eap <dig> gene. as a member of the gpi-cwp family in c. albicans <cit> , eap1p was originally identified because of its ability to mediate adhesion to polystyrene when the eap <dig> gene was expressed in a flocculin-deficient saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. eap <dig> expression in a c. albicans efg1/efg <dig> mutant was able to restore c. albicans adhesion to epithelial cells
 <cit> . deleting eap <dig> in c. albicans was shown to reduce cell adhesion to polystyrene and to epithelial cells in a gene dosage-dependent manner
 <cit> . indeed, this suggests that exposure to csc increases eap <dig> expression, which may in turn contribute to increasing c. albicans adhesion, and ultimately, biofilm formation and pathogenesis.

we also demonstrated that csc increased hwp <dig> mrna expression. hwp <dig> is a downstream component of the camp-dependent pka pathway and is positively regulated by efg <dig> <cit> . the transcript level of hwp <dig> increased with increasing csc stimulation, which suggests that csc did affect camp–efg <dig> pathway activity, resulting in an increase of c. albicans adhesion and growth with biofilm formation. further investigations are therefore warranted to gain greater insight into the interaction between cigarette smoke and c. albicans leading to infection.

candida pathogenesis is associated with the production and secretion of histolytic enzymes
 <cit> . secreted aspartyl proteases  and phospholipases were specifically reported as being directly related to c. albicans virulence
 <cit> . during infection, saps are incriminated degrading host proteins involved in tissue barriers and immune defense
 <cit> . here, we report that csc upregulated sap <dig> mrna expression. it is known that sap gene upregulation contributes to increasing c. albicans transition, and later, its pathogenicity through an augmented secretion of proteinases
 <cit> . our study thus establishes, for the first time, a clear link between cigarette smoke and c. albicans pathogenesis through the behavior of key genes such as eap <dig>  hwp <dig> and sap <dig>  these genes are known to be involved in controlling candida adhesion, growth, and biofilm formation
 <cit> ; however, the precise interactions between these different genes and cigarette smoke during c. albicans pathogenesis have not yet been fully investigated. data suggest that gene activation can be involved in c. albicans adhesion, growth and biofilm formation promoted by csc. this may involve kinase pathways contributing to c. albicans adaptation to the csc environment as previously suggested
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that csc upregulates c. albicans adhesion and growth that promote biofilm formation. of interest is that these effects were supported by the modulation of c. albicans genes eap <dig>  hwp <dig>  and sap <dig>  overall results therefore suggest a possible link between cigarette smoke, c. albicans activation, and oral candidiasis.
