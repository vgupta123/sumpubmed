BACKGROUND
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  is characterized by fluid-filled cysts that are thought to result from abnormal cell proliferation and deregulated apoptosis, increased secretion of fluids into the tubular lumen, irregular cell-matrix interactions, and defective cellular polarity  <cit> . thus, normal parenchyma is replaced by a cystic epithelium and fibrotic tissue  <cit> . genetic mutations in pkd <dig>  are responsible for majority of cases of adpkd, the remainder are due to loss of pkd <dig> . loss of pc- <dig> or pc <dig> expression results in disruption of intracellular ca2+ levels, which may lead to abnormal proliferation of tubule epithelial cells  <cit> . additionally, the involvement of pc- <dig> in various pathways related to proliferation, such as g-protein signaling, wnt signaling, ap- <dig>  and cell cycle arrest has been reported  <cit> . however, the manner in which these diverse pathways are integrated into cellular circuitry and regulated during progression of adpkd is not well studied.

micrornas  are small endogenous non-protein encoding rnas that post-transcriptionally modulate gene expression by binding to the 3'utr of target mrnas  <cit> . they are involved in many biological processes including cell differentiation, cell proliferation, cell mobility and apoptosis  <cit>  and are associated with many diseases including cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and kidney dysfunction  <cit> . for example, kato et al reported a role for mir- <dig> in diabetic nephropathy  <cit> . also, over-expression of the mir-17- <dig> cluster may play a role in renal cell carcinoma  <cit> . further, the importance of mirnas that are expressed in kidney is supported by mouse knockout studies  <cit> . for example, eliminating dicer, a key enzyme in mirna biogenesis, from podocytes, a cell type required for the formation of the size exclusion barrier in the glomerulus, results in progressive loss of podocyte function  <cit> . some studies have also suggested a role for mirnas in adpkd  <cit> .

the pkd1-/- mouse model develops cystic disease caused by mutation of the same gene responsible for the majority of human adpkd, and provides a system to study the pathogenesis of adpkd  <cit> . however, a systematic, large-scale study, elucidating global changes in gene expression during disease progression in the pkd1-/- mouse model has yet to be reported. using the pkd1-/- model to study the pathogenesis of adpkd offers the ability to compare gene expression in pre-diseased and diseased kidneys. in the current investigation, we  use the pkd1-/- model to explore the transcriptional changes that occur in adpkd on a whole genome scale,  undertake a comparative transcriptomics approach to determine similarities and differences with human adpkd, and  investigate whether these changes might be related to changes in mirna expression. we systemically predicted the possible mirnas that may be associated with the changes in mrna expression levels during disease progression that were determined by gene expression microarray analysis. we predicted mirnas that could target signaling pathways in adpkd. our results suggest that several mirnas may be involved in regulating the genetic switches in adpkd. we further describe several mirnas and putative mirna-mrna signatures, which were previously not reported in adpkd.

methods
animal model
kidneys from wild type  and pkd1-null, designated as pkd1-/-, mutant littermates were investigated at the embryonic ages  <dig>  and  <dig> . the kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, paraffin-embedded, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the sections were visualized with a nikon eclipse 80i microscope and photographed with a qimaging retiga 2000r fast  <dig> camera using nis-elements basic research  <dig>  software .

total rna extraction and microarrays
total rna was extracted from embryonic kidneys at, e <dig>  and e <dig> , using the qiagen mirneasy mini kit . three pairs of kidneys at e <dig>  and e <dig>  were processed. each pair was analyzed separately. the integrity and purity of the mrna samples were assessed prior to hybridization using bioanalyser  <dig> with mrna nanochips . rna hybridization was performed, and gene expression profiles were determined using illumina mouse sentrix  <dig> version  <dig> beadchips. the data extraction was performed by using an illumina bead studio v <dig> . <dig>  software with the output being raw, non-normalized bead summary values.

the raw data matrix extracted from beadstudio was uploaded in bioconductor r version  <dig> . <dig> for downstream analysis. the raw data were read using the beadarray package available through the bioconductor project. the raw intensities were background adjusted by the subtract method. the log <dig> summarized data were quantile normalized. the limma package  <cit>  with empirical bayes method was used to assess the differentially expressed genes.

the data discussed in this publication have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> .

gene set enrichment analysis and gene ontology enrichment analysis
gene set enrichment analysis   was used to identify potential gene pathways and key transcription factors  that may modulate cystogenesis . the gsea c <dig> database  that includes well-studied metabolic and signaling pathways and published microarray data sets was used for pathway analysis. the gsea c <dig> database containing shared and evolutionarily conserved tf binding motifs defined by the transfac database was used for tf analysis. the description of each gene set can be found on the gsea molecular signatures database website: http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp enrichment of gene ontology  categories  in the differentially expressed genes was determined using bioconductor's gostats package  <cit>  for both up- and down-regulated genes.

comparison with other datasets on adpkd
two datasets on adpkd with mutation in pkd <dig>  pkd1l3/l <dig>  <cit>  and human adpkd  <cit>  were obtained from the geo database . raw data were log <dig> summarized and quantile normalized. the limma package  <cit>  with empirical bayes method was used to assess the differentially expressed genes between mutants and controls. these were compared with the differentially expressed genes obtained in comparisons using custom written perl scripts.

mirna prediction
as shown in figure  <dig>  a combinatorial strategy was used where target mirnas were predicted for the differentially expressed genes using four algorithms, targetscan , miranda , mirdb  and microt . to identify the mirnas commonly predicted by two or more algorithms, results were intersected  using custom written perl scripts .

quantitative real-time pcr
total rna was extracted from pkd1-/- and wt kidneys. three independent biological replicates  were used and all reactions were run in duplicates for all the expression analysis of genes and mirnas. for all the quantitative real-time-pcr  assays, the abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system was used. the comparative ct method was used to obtain relative quantitation of genes and mirnas as per the manufacturer's protocol . for gene expression analysis, cdna was made using superscript iii reverse transcriptase . qpcrs were performed, using power sybr® green pcr master mix . primer sets for p2rx <dig>  cpeb <dig>  hdac <dig>  sox <dig>  ltbp <dig>  calcr, pitx <dig>  fgfr <dig>  fgf <dig>  adam <dig>  ddx3y, f2rl <dig>  grap <dig>  edil <dig>  mysm <dig>  alg <dig> and alg <dig> are available in additional file  <dig>  18s rrna was used as the endogenous control.

mirna reverse transcription was performed using the taqman microrna reverse transcription kit and mirna-specific primers . real-time taqman mirna-assays were used to quantify mirna expression using the taqman master mix and validated primer/probe sets . mirna levels were normalized to snorna- <dig>  cycling conditions for taqman pcr consisted of an initial incubation at 50°c for  <dig> min and 95°c for  <dig> sec and 60°c for  <dig> min.

RESULTS
pkd1-/- mice model and design of experiment
to study the detailed changes in molecular profiles during the progression of adpkd, we generated and compared gene expression profiles of pkd1-/- embryonic kidneys and age-matched wt kidneys at two stages, e <dig>  and e <dig>  . pkd1-/- embryos develop rapidly progressive kidney cysts during embryogenesis, with null mutant kidneys showing no cysts at e <dig>  and marked cystic changes by e <dig>  . unsupervised hierarchical clustering was able to discriminate wt and mutant kidney samples at both time points . at the same time, the cluster analysis was also able to distinguish changes between e <dig>  and e <dig>  kidneys . table  <dig> shows a summary of number of differentially expressed genes and pathways for all of the comparisons. genes showing a greater than 2-fold difference in expression between wt and mutant kidneys at e <dig>  as well as at e <dig>  , were considered to be differentially expressed whereas in the comparisons of wt kidneys at e <dig>  vs e <dig>  and pkd1-/- kidneys at e <dig>  vs e <dig> , genes with ≥ 2-fold difference in expression at p-value ≤ <dig>   were considered as differentially expressed. the expression of  <dig> genes was significantly changed between wt and mutant kidneys at e <dig>   whereas  <dig> genes were significantly changed at e <dig>  between wt and mutant kidneys . the comparison of e <dig>  and e <dig>  wt kidneys yielded  <dig> differentially expressed genes  whereas  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in comparison of pkd1-/- kidneys at e <dig>  vs e <dig>  . comparing differentially expressed genes observed in pkd1-/- at e <dig>  vs e <dig>   and in wt at e <dig>  vs e <dig>   identified genes that were specifically changing during development in diseased  or healthy conditions  as shown in figure  <dig>  this comparison also indicated genes that were regulated during aging from e <dig>  to e <dig>  regardless of the genotype . these results indicate that maturation accounted for the greatest number of changes in gene expression, more so than the cyst formation. nevertheless,  <dig> genes  could be identified for which changes in gene expression levels were specific for pkd1-/- kidneys. thus, this analysis served to identify a set of genes specifically changing in pkd that can yield insights about the regulation of gene expression during cystogenesis.

profiling gene expression changes in pkd1-/- mutants at e <dig>  and e <dig> 
at e <dig> , pkd1-/- mutants do not exhibit any cyst formation . therefore gene expression changes at e <dig>  may provide an indication of signaling pathways that cause cysts rather than being a consequence of cyst formation. among the most interesting genes identified by microarrays were p2rx <dig>  cer <dig>  frzb, wnt7b, dvl <dig>  gpr <dig>  and gpr <dig>  these genes are representative of calcium, wnt and gpcr signaling, and their roles are discussed later.

pkd1-/- mutant embryos show numerous large renal cysts at e <dig> . microarray analysis showed up-regulation of multiple developmental genes such as bmp8b, grem <dig>  mmp <dig>  sema3c, sema4c and sema6c and transcription factors - gli <dig>  foxo <dig>  foxp <dig>  hoxb <dig>  pou2f <dig> and zbtb <dig> at e <dig>  in pkd1-/- mutant kidneys compared to wt. many of these genes are essential for ureteric bud formation, outgrowth, and branching during kidney development. on the other hand, the expression of genes associated with the differentiation of specific nephron segments, such as umod, pck <dig>  fmo <dig>  slc12a <dig>  pvalb, and angpt <dig> were down-regulated in the null mutants. these data suggest that pkd1-/- mutants have failed to maintain nephron segment-specific transcriptional signatures. additionally, we found changes in expression of genes previously related to cyst growth and progression such as components of mapk and jak/stat signaling .

gene pathway analysis using go term enrichment and gene set enrichment analysis
gene ontology  and gene set enrichment analysis  are two bioinformatics approaches to identify pathways involved in specific biological processes such as development and disease. go term enrichment uses association of gene ontology terms to genes in a selected gene list. this method discovers what a set of genes may have in common by examining annotations and finding significant shared go terms whereas gsea determines whether a known set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological conditions, e.g. wt and pkd1-/-.

nes represents the degree of enrichment of the gene set at the top or bottom of the ordered gene list.

nom p-value measures the significance of nes for a gene set by using permutation testing. nom p-value <  <dig>  is used for table  <dig> 

we found that most of the down-regulated gene sets in pkd1-/- mutants compared to wt at e <dig>  and e <dig>  represent metabolic pathways , as suggested by gsea and go analysis. in contrast, both the gsea and go analysis of up-regulated gene sets in pkd1-/- mutants compared to wt at e <dig>  and e <dig>  suggested that pkd1-/- mutants displayed a rich gene transcriptional profile for kidney development and regeneration, including wnt, calcium, mapk and tgfβ signaling . among the pathways identified by go and gsea were the following:

activation of mitogenic signaling pathways
we identified  <dig> up-regulated gene sets in pkd1-/- mutants compared to wt associated with mitogenic signaling at e <dig> , including those associated with growth factor/receptor tyrosine kinase  signaling  and extracellular cellular matrix /integrin signaling. previous studies have suggested that activation of egfs, fgfs and their receptors could promote tubular epithelial cell proliferation and cyst formation in pkd  <cit> . we found fgfr <dig> , fgfr <dig> , fgf <dig> , nrg <dig>  and prkcb  up-regulated in pkd1-/- mutants compared to wt at e <dig> . although gene sets associated with g protein-coupled receptor  were not definitively enriched  in the cystic kidneys at e <dig>   as shown in additional file  <dig>  we identified  <dig> up-regulated individual genes associated with gpcr. of interest, genes involved in camp mediated signaling and calcium regulation such as pde4b , calcr , and sstr <dig>  were all up-regulated, while negative regulator of gpcr signaling such as gprasp <dig> , and rgs <dig>   <cit>  were down-regulated. these results suggest changes in gpcr signaling that might be associated with intracellular camp and calcium regulation in the kidneys of pkd1-/- animals.

increased camp has been shown to promote renal cystic epithelial proliferation in pkd  <cit> . we observed up-regulation of adenylyl cyclase, adcy <dig>  which may increase camp production in the renal cysts, which in turn promotes renal cystic epithelial proliferation in pkd  <cit> . the change in ca2+ homeostasis is an important feature of adpkd and may lead to increased levels of camp  <cit> . although the gene sets for calcium/calcineurin/nfat signaling were not significantly enriched , we found that crebbp , p2rx <dig> , prkcb  and traf <dig>  were up-regulated in the pkd1-/- cystic kidneys, suggesting a situation where limitation of intracellular ca2+ could promote camp mediated activation of b-raf/mek/erk pathway and cellular proliferation  <cit> .

previous studies suggested that aberrant activation of erk/mapk signaling might modulate cyst growth in adpkd. we found three gene sets for erk/mapk signaling cascades up-regulated in pkd1-/- kidneys compared to wt at e <dig>   including up-regulation of fgfr <dig> , map3k <dig> , mink <dig> , rps6ka <dig> , and fosb . although we found slight up-regulation of akt <dig>  and eif4e , no definitive enrichment of the mtor pathway could be determined. this may be important from a therapeutic perspective: the mtor pathway has been considered as a drug target in arresting adpkd progression, despite recent studies in humans with adpkd that did not demonstrate a therapeutic effect of sirolimus and everolimus, inhibitors of the mtor pathway, on cyst progression  <cit> .

activation of angiogenic and immune/inflammatory pathways
activation of immunoregulatory and inflammatory pathways may be involved in cyst growth in adpkd. multiple up-regulated gene sets in the pkd1-/- kidneys compared to wt at e <dig>  were associated with immune/inflammatory , immunoregulation and inflammation ) responses including up-regulation of il1rl <dig> , il28ra , il4i <dig> , jakmip <dig>  and jakmip <dig> . we found increased expression of cytokines such as cxcl <dig> , cxcl <dig> , and clcf <dig> . we also found two dysregulated pathways for aging in pkd1-/- kidneys compared to wt at e <dig>  .

activation of hdac inhibitor pathways
recently it has been shown that inhibition of class i hdacs is able to suppress pkd <dig> related phenotypes  <cit> . our studies have not implicated any class i hdacs in the pathogenesis of pkd <dig>  on the other hand, we found down-regulation of a member of the class ii hdacs, hdac <dig>  in pkd1-/- mutants compared to wt at e <dig> . additionally, we found multiple up-regulated gene sets belonging to the class of histone deacetylase inhibitors  in pkd1-/- kidneys compared to wt at e <dig> . hdac <dig> plays a role in hematopoiesis, and its deregulated expression, along with altered expression of tgf-β <dig>  may be associated with human cancer and peters' anomaly  <cit> . as reported in the kegg pathway database , histone deacetylases are involved in many pathways including signal transduction, the notch signaling pathway, cell growth, and death/cell cycle. their precise role in pkd <dig> dependent adpkd remains obscure. however, strong differential regulation of genes involved in the class ii hdac regulatory cascade suggests that histone modification may be an important event in transcriptome reprogramming during pkd progression.

comparison with other adpkd data sets in mouse and human
we aimed to derive correlations between the gene expression changes in pkd and a set of pathways that modulate disease severity in our mouse model and human adpkd. we compared our study with another published study using the pkd1l3/l <dig> mouse model  <cit>  and with the data set available on human adpkd  <cit> . chen et al. described members of three pathways, wnt, notch, and bmp, as differentially regulated in the pkd1l3/l <dig> model compared to the control wt  <cit> . our data from the pkd1-/- model confirmed the differential regulation of members of these pathways . a total of  <dig> dysregulated genes were common between the pkd1l3/l <dig> model data and our set of differentially expressed genes at e <dig>  , whereas  <dig> dysregulated genes were common between our pkd1-/- model at e <dig>   and the pkd1l3/l <dig> model. a ~20% commonality was observed at the pathway level between our pkd1-/- model and the pkd1l3/l <dig> model. the comparison between our data set  with human adpkd data  <cit>  showed a 50% overlap between significantly enriched pathways , which included several important pathways such as calcium signaling, wnt, mapk, tgfβ signaling pathways, immune/inflammatory responses, and notch signaling pathways. on the individual gene level, 20%  of genes were similarly changed in both our mouse model and human adpkd .

transcription factor analysis of pkd1-/- kidneys
computational analysis of genetic regulatory regions of co-expressed genes can furnish additional information on the regulation of a gene set by specific transcription factors   <cit> . using gsea, we searched for overrepresented tf promoter binding motifs among differentially expressed genes . we defined overrepresented tf binding motifs by a nom p-value ≤  <dig> . additional file  <dig> lists all the dysregulated gene sets with shared tf binding sites for renal development, mitogen-mediated proliferation, cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and immune/inflammatory response. several of these enriched transcription factors, such as gli <dig> , foxo <dig>  and pou2f <dig>  were also differentially regulated in our microarray analyses, providing additional evidence for their functional relevance in pkd.

prediction of mirna and mirna-target interactions, and analysis of mirna expression

validation of expression by qpcr
using qpcr assays for the pkd1-/- and wt samples, we confirmed the microarray results on a subset of genes that were-  differentially expressed on microarrays,  known/suggested to be involved in adpkd, and  targets of mirnas predicted by two or more tools. these genes were p2rx <dig>  cpeb <dig>  hdac <dig>  sox <dig>  calcr, pitx <dig>  fgfr <dig>  fgf <dig>  adam <dig>  ddx3y, f2rl <dig>  grap <dig>  edil <dig>  mysm <dig> and alg <dig> . qualitatively, the qpcr validation data agreed with the microarray data . on the other hand, we found that for certain genes such as adam <dig>  grap <dig> and f2rl <dig> the fold changes observed on microarrays varied from those obtained by qpcr . several factors may be responsible for these variations, among which include the distinct platforms used for microarrays and qpcr, differences in qpcr amplicon/primers and hybridization probes, non-specific and cross-hybridization and issues associated with amplification of mrna samples  <cit> .

computational identification of a large number of mirna-mrna target interactions suggested that the expression of mirnas might also change during the progression of pkd. we tested this hypothesis by determining the differential expression of  <dig> mirnas  between wt and pkd1-/- genotypes at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . these nine mirnas are expressed in kidney  <cit> , but have not been previously associated with adpkd. in our computational analysis, two or more tools predicted them as targets for differentially expressed genes at e <dig>  and e <dig> . the significance of changes in relative expression of mirnas among the two groups was tested by student's t-test, and a cutoff of  <dig>  fold  <cit>  and p ≤  <dig>  was used to determine the differential mirna accumulation.

among the  <dig> mirnas tested at e <dig> , only two mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were down-regulated in pkd1-/- kidneys compared to wt, mir- <dig> did not change, and the remaining  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated in pkd1-/- kidneys compared to wt . in contrast, at e <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-30a were up-regulated in pkd1-/- kidneys compared to wt. mir-200a did not show significant variation between the wt and pkd1-/- kidneys at e <dig>  . this indicates that mirna expression also undergoes reprogramming during pkd. given that renal cystic- and control- kidneys contained a mixture of cell types, the moderate effects we observed in changes in mirna levels may in reality be far stronger in specific cell/tissue types.

mirna-mrna interactions
most mirnas negatively regulate the levels of expression of their targets: therefore, mirna-mrna target pair should be inversely correlated for their expression levels i.e. if the expression of a given mirna is up-regulated, levels of its target genes should be down-regulated and vice-versa. indeed, this was observed for a large number of predicted mirna:mrna interactions. at e <dig> , expression of  <dig> mirnas was inversely related to expression of  <dig> potential target genes, indicating that these relationships may be functional mirna-target combinations in adpkd . similarly,  <dig> genes that were potential targets of  <dig> mirnas were inversely related by their expression at e <dig>  . several of the genes verified with qpcrs , and predicted as targets of the mirnas, showed a reciprocal relationship . for example, down-regulation of mir-200a at e <dig>  was correlated with up-regulation of pitx <dig> in the pkd1-/- mutants . similarly, down-regulation of mir-10a, mir-126-5p, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> at e <dig>  were inversely correlated with up-regulation of ltbp <dig>  edil <dig>  p2rx <dig>  and fgfr <dig> respectively . conversely, we found that up-regulation of mir-30a-5p, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> at e <dig> , and mir- <dig> at e <dig>  were reciprocally correlated with down-regulation of cpeb <dig>  sox <dig>  hdac <dig>  and ddx3y respectively in pkd1-/- mutants . moreover, mirs-10a, -30a-5p, - <dig>  -126-5p, - <dig>  -200a, - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> have not been previously linked to pkd. thus, our analysis suggests a potential important role for mirnas in pkd, though we emphasize that these predicted mirna:mrna interaction pairs are subject to further experimental validation.

we analyzed the functional enrichment of predicted and validated  mirnas for differentially expressed genes in each comparison in an attempt to uncover the functional meaning among these mirnas . genes that were commonly targeted by the differentially expressed mirnas in pkd1-/- samples were clustered in  <dig> biochemical pathways. the overall analysis highlighted that signal transduction pathways such as calcium, vegf, notch, and mapk signaling  may be regulated by mirna. for example, mir-30a-5p may be involved in histone deactylase inhibitor pathways, apoptosis, calcium and wnt signaling ; mir-10a may be involved in tgf-β and hedgehog signaling; mir- <dig> may be involved in calcium signaling while mir- <dig> may be involved in mapk signaling by targeting fgfr <dig> . thus, we generated a comprehensive atlas of mirna-target genes and pathways during the progression of pkd. this dataset will serve as a useful resource for future investigations.

discussion
in the current investigation, we have attempted to uncover the gene expression signatures associated with the initiation and progression of adpkd, to decipher the signal transduction pathways associated with these changes in gene expression, and to explore the potential role of mirnas in effecting these gene expression and signal transduction differences between normal and pkd kidneys. we used a combinatorial approach involving microarrays, data mining and prediction of target mirnas to profile changes in gene expression during progression of adpkd, integrate various signaling pathways and present a possible cellular signaling circuitry in pkd . in parallel to the mrna expression profiling, we also determined the changes in expression of several mirnas that were computationally identified for their probable roles in adpkd, thus allowing us to predict several mirna-mrna reciprocal interactions. by comparing our datasets with those available for human adpkd, we found common mis-regulated pathways in the developmental and signaling pathways. identification of commonly regulated pathways and genes between mice and humans is essential for designing effective therapeutics, as these genes/pathways would be targets for pharmacological intervention in humans with pkd.

transcriptome changes in pkd
a high level of complexity in the molecular pathobiology was found in pkd1-/- cystic kidneys. we identified genes that were changed only in pkd1-/- animals such as aqp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp8b, ddx3y, kl, psen <dig> and pitx <dig>  this shows changes in expression of developmental and nephron-segment specific genes. further we identified changes in expression of genes that may be associated with pre-cystic stages leading to cyst formation such as changes in the components of wnt signaling. we identified changes in gene expression related to cyst growth such as components of mapk  and tgf-β  signaling that were up-regulated in the pkd1-/- animals. the go term enrichment and gsea revealed changes in calcium, mapk, wnt, tgf-β and jak/stat signaling pathways in the pkd1-/- animals. additionally, this analysis showed that the class ii hdac, hdac <dig> was strongly down-regulated in pkd1-/- animals. this could effect more global changes in gene expression.

mitogen-activated protein kinases play central roles in the signal transduction pathways that affect gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis  <cit> . although some studies have suggested that cellular proliferation may be involved in initial cyst formation in pkd, other evidence suggests that abnormal proliferation contributes to cyst growth rather than cyst initiation  <cit> . our data , showing a greater increase in mapk-associated pathways at e <dig>  as compared with e <dig> , are more consistent with the latter hypothesis that proliferation is more important in cyst growth than in initiation.

wnt signaling in adpkd
previous studies have shown that the activation of canonical wnt signaling  <cit>  and inhibition of non-canonical wnt signaling  may play roles in cyst formation in pkd  <cit> . we found wnt7b , fzd <dig> , dvl <dig>  and lef <dig>  were up-regulated while apc , an inhibitor of canonical wnt signaling was down-regulated at e <dig> . although microarray probes failed to detect increased wnt7a expression, our independent study confirms up-regulation of wnt7a in pkd1-/- animals . moreover, in a study of pkd1l3/l <dig> mouse model wnt7a and wnt7b were also found up-regulated in mutant kidneys  <cit> . the gsea results also showed enrichment of canonical wnt signaling for up-regulated genes in pkd1-/- mutants at e <dig>  . canonical wnt signaling was also up-regulated at e <dig> , as determined by both go analysis and gsea . together, these results suggested that there may be an increase in canonical wnt signaling in pkd1-/- animals. additionally, the go term enrichment analysis showed down-regulation of non-canonical wnt signaling in pkd1-/- animals at e <dig>  .

in contradistinction to the go and gsea analyses suggesting increased wnt signaling in pkd1-/- kidneys, we found that two potential inhibitors of wnt signaling, cer <dig> and frzb , were up-regulated in pkd1-/- animals at e <dig> . cer <dig> and frzb belong to the family of sfrps  that act as inhibitors of wnt signaling in animals such as xenopus and chick by interfering with the binding of wnt proteins to frizzled transmembrane receptors  <cit> . frzb is a known wnt antagonist in mammals  <cit> . however the mouse cer <dig> may not inhibit wnt signaling  <cit> . at present we are unable to explain the discrepancy between the overall informatic result that canonical wnt signaling is increased in pkd1-/- kidneys, and the observed increased expression of wnt antagonists cer <dig> and frzb. it is possible that cer <dig> and/or frzb have a greater ability to interfere with non-canonical vs. canonical wnt signaling, and that this will be borne out by future studies.

calcium signaling in adpkd
the polycystin-1/ <dig> complex  mediates ca2+ entry into the cell in response to mechanical stimulation of the primary cilium  <cit> . this in turn triggers additional release of ca2+ from intracellular stores. thus, disruption of the polycystin pathway alters intracellular ca2+ homeostasis  <cit> . it has been suggested that altered intracellular ca2+ levels increases camp levels by stimulating adenylyl cyclases  <cit> . in turn, increased camp paradoxically stimulates mapk/erk signaling and promotes renal cystic epithelial proliferation in pkd1-/- cells  <cit> . our results showed that in pkd1-/- animals at e <dig>  an adenylyl cyclase, adcy <dig> was up-regulated. thus, increased gene expression of an adenylyl cyclase may be an additional contributing factor to increased camp levels in adpkd.

novel regulatory mechanisms in adpkd
our study identifies several new nodes of regulation in adpkd. for example, we found a strong down-regulation of alg <dig>  in the pkd1-/- genotype at e <dig> . algs are important components of the glycosylation pathway involving the endoplasmic reticulum  and the golgi apparatus. alg <dig> encodes a member of the glucosyltransferase family that catalyzes the addition of the first glucose residue to the growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor of n-linked glycosylation. mutations in this gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation type ic  <cit> . indeed, in pkd1-/- mice, defective glycosylation of protein has been observed, that may have important implications for adpkd  <cit> . as alg <dig> encodes an er glucosyltransferase  <cit> , its specific downregulation in the pkd1-/- genotype indicates metabolic reprogramming in the er and golgi complex. thus, exploring alg <dig> function in knock-down studies in kidneys may provide new insights regarding the disease processes underlying adpkd.

the comparison of the pkd1-/-mouse model and human adpkd data sets revealed significant overlaps. some representative of commonly up-regulated genes include adcy <dig> , crebbp , cxcl <dig> , vegfb , dvl <dig> , tgif <dig> and smurf <dig> . representative down-regulated genes that were commonly changed between the two data sets include umod , rgs <dig> , pvalb , pck <dig> , and lamc <dig> . thus, these genes may be used as prognostic markers for adpkd.

possible regulatory roles of mirnas in adpkd
we examined the possible involvement of mirnas in adpkd in the pkd1-/- mouse model. while several mirnas can target a single transcript, each mirna can also have multiple targets  <cit> . thus, moderate alterations in mirna levels can have profound effects on the accumulation of their targets  <cit> . however, their role in adpkd, both at the individual as well as the systems levels, is still under investigation, as only three studies have directly demonstrated changes in mirna expression in adpkd  <cit> . we have addressed this problem by systemically estimating the possible mirnas that may target genes deregulated during disease progression . we have predicted and verified  reciprocal expression of several mirnas and their predicted targets in pkd1-/- animals . we observed that mirnas: mirs-10a, -30a-5p, - <dig>  -126-5p, - <dig>  -200a, - <dig>  - <dig>  and -488; and the mirna-mrna interactions such as mir-126-5p-fgf <dig>  mir-488-fgfr <dig>  mir-182-hdac <dig>  mir-204-p2rx <dig> and mir-96-sox <dig>  have not been previously reported in adpkd.

signaling pathways are ideal candidates for mirna-mediated regulation, as their components require finely tuned temporal changes in their expression  <cit> . mirnas may affect the responsiveness of cells to signaling molecules such as tgfβ, wnt, notch, and epidermal growth factor  <cit> . once a mirna targets an inhibitor of a signaling cascade, it serves as a positive regulator by either amplifying signal strength or duration, or empowering cell responsiveness to otherwise sub-threshold stimuli. for example, mir- <dig> promotes angiogenesis and vascular integrity  <cit>  by inhibiting the production of natural repressor  of vegf signaling, suggesting that it may serve as an effective target for anti-angiogenic therapies. we found that mir-126-5p may be involved in calcium, egf, mapk signaling, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction . previous studies  <cit>  have shown that a single mirna can act simultaneously on multiple signaling pathways to coordinate their biological effects and concurrently several mirnas may regulate single pathway . moreover, the predicted mirna:mrna interactions suggested that the involvement of mirnas in the signaling pathways through their target mrnas may lead to the dysregulation of these pathways. for example, the interaction of mir-204:p2rx <dig>  suggested a possibility that the down-regulation of mir- <dig> may lead to up-regulation of its target gene, p2rx <dig> at e <dig>  in pkd1-/- kidneys. p2rx <dig> is a cell-surface, ligand-gated cation channel and its stimulation leads to alteration in the intracellular ca2+ levels that may further result into dysregulation of calcium signaling. therefore, by targeting p2rx <dig>  mir- <dig> may disrupt calcium signaling. similarly, at e <dig>  in pkd1-/- animals, the up-regulation of fgfr <dig> and fgf <dig>  and down-regulation of their target mirnas- mir- <dig> and mir-126-5p respectively, may stimulate mapk signaling and cell proliferation in pkd1-/- samples.

the functional correlation between the differentially expressed mrnas and mirnas as a module in adpkd revealed a tight post-transcriptional regulatory network at the mrna level whose alteration might contribute to increased immune response, by either direct mirna targeting or through secondary proteins. further progress in the understanding of mirna activity, the identification of mirna signatures in different states, and the advancement of mirna manipulation techniques will be valuable for deciphering the roles of individual mirnas in pkd. the overall discovery of differentially regulated mirnas in the different diseases is expected not only to broaden our biological understanding of these diseases, but more importantly, to identify candidate mirnas as potential targets for future clinical applications.

CONCLUSIONS
we have attempted to reveal the molecular players of pkd in a pkd1-/- mouse model. taken together, our study suggests the presence of complex layers of regulation in adpkd. our microarray data revealed genes that specifically changed during disease condition. further we identified genes related to pre-cystic stages and cyst progression. our model suggests a cascade of signaling events involving up-regulation of canonical- and down-regulation of non-canonical- wnt signaling that may result in decreased intracellular ca2+ concentration, resulting in an increase of intracellular camp levels that in turn stimulates mapk/erk signaling leading to proliferation, followed by increased jak-stat signaling and inflammation , ultimately leading to renal failure. further, we determined gene expression signatures common between the pkd1-/- mouse model and human adpkd. these could be used as prognostic markers of disease progression in pkd. moreover, we add various new components including alg <dig>  hdac <dig> and several mirnas to the regulatory layers of adpkd. we predicted that several of the differentially regulated genes are mirna targets and mirs-10a, -30a-5p, - <dig>  -126-5p, - <dig>  -200a, - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> may be important players in cellular signalling events leading to pkd. furthermore, it is interesting to note that these mirnas have not been previously reported in pkd. it has been proposed that a single mirna can target more than hundred genes and one gene can be the target of several mirnas  <cit> . a future challenge will be to systemically identify all of the mirnas affecting, and regulated by, the dysregulated cell signalling pathways in adpkd. extensive functional analyses of these mirnas and their target genes by performing knockout and over-expression studies, individually and in combination, are likely to open up new avenues for pkd research.
