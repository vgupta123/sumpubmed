BACKGROUND
plant genomes may vary over  <dig> -fold in genome size . within the grass family, bread wheat, also known as common or hexaploid wheat , has a large genome size of  <dig> gb because of two allopolypoidization events and also a very high repetitive dna content . each chromosome of wheat, at an average size of 809 mb , is twice the size of the rice genome . therefore, the physical mapping and sequencing of the wheat genome poses a technical challenge and is cost prohibitive, as discussed at an nsf-sponsored workshop  <cit> . the wheat genomics community decided on a chromosome-based approach to physical mapping and sequencing to overcome these problems and to provide an opportunity for division of labor and cost sharing by establishing an international consortium of scientists . this approach is feasible because of the ability to purify wheat chromosomes and/or chromosome arms by flow cytometric sorting. particular chromosomes and chromosome arms can be isolated at over 90 % purity and in sufficient quantity for making chromosome and chromosome arm-specific bac libraries  <cit> .

among the wheat chromosomes, 3b is the largest, sorts out as a single peak on a flow karyotype and its bac library  <cit>  was used to construct the first wheat chromosome physical map  <cit> . another peak contains three of the smallest wheat chromosomes 1d, 4d and 6d, and their physical map construction is underway . for the remaining wheat chromosomes, lines carrying telocentric chromosomes, which represent individual arms, must be used to increase sorting resolution and library construction  <cit> . chromosome and chromosome arm-specific bac libraries now have been constructed for most of the wheat chromosomes  <cit> .

flow-sorted chromosomes and libraries have been utilized for generating chromosome and chromosome arm-specific sequence information for gene discovery and comparative genome analysis. bac end sequences  have been analyzed from bac libraries and can be highly informative in determining genome content and organization, enhance the value of bacs as a genomic resource and also provide random sequence information. bess have been used to estimate the distribution of the repetitive elements including the retrotransposons, dna transposons and ssrs in several plant species  <cit> . paux et al.  <cit>  generated 11 mb of random bess from chromosome 3b of bread wheat and reported 86% of the sequences as repetitive elements,  <dig> % as coding region and 13% was unknown. bess can be an excellent source for marker development for genetic and physical mapping. bess were used to develop simple sequence repeats, genic sequence-based markers and, more recently, inserted transposable elements junction based isbp markers  <cit> .

sequences from the whole-genome amplification of flow-sorted chromosomes or chromosome-arms have been published for several wheat and barley chromosomes  <cit> . wicker et al.  <cit>  sequenced flow-sorted wheat group- <dig> chromosomes by roche/ <dig> technology at  <dig> – <dig> x coverage and used the sequence data to estimate gene syntenic relationships of the triticeae with brachypodium, rice and sorghum and suggested a large number of sequences that are nonsyntenic to model grasses are probably pseudogenes. berkman et al.  <cit>  recently sequenced the flow sorted chromosomes 7bs and 7ds of wheat to isolate the low copy and genic sequences and observed ~ 60% rate of colinearity with brachypodium. recently, rustenholnz et al. studied the gene space organization in wheat by mapping the expressed portion of chromosome 3b using barley microarrays  <cit>  and a wheat unigene microarray  <cit>  and observed a 2-fold increase in gene density from centromere towards the telomeres. a bes  <cit>  and transcript map  <cit>  of chromosome 3b provide an opportunity for comparative analysis of homoeologous chromosomes.

in this study, we used the first arm-specific library in wheat from chromosome 3as  <cit>  for which we are developing a physical map. the 3as bac library consists of  <dig>   <dig> clones . we randomly selected nearly  <dig>  bacs and end sequenced them to generate 11 mb of sequence. these sequences were analyzed to obtain insight into the sequence composition of wheat chromosome arm 3as and its evolutionary relationship with other homoeologous chromosomes and model grass genomes. furthermore, we identified dna motifs potentially useful as molecular markers to saturate chromosome 3as.

RESULTS
bac-end sequencing and data processing
chromosome 3a of bread wheat is among the largest wheat chromosomes with a metaphase size of  <dig>  μm, is submetacentric with an arm ratio of  <dig>  and accounts for  <dig> % of the total a genome of hexaploid wheat  <cit> . chromosome arm 3as is estimated at ~355 mb, equivalent to  <dig>  times the size of the rice genome. we have fingerprinted and assembled contigs of  <dig>  clones of the bread wheat cultivar chinese spring chromosome arm 3as-specific bac library . the first phase of assembly of the 3as physical map used fpc  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , where  <dig>  clones are assembled into  <dig>  contigs with the remaining  <dig>  clones existing as singletons. in parallel, a total of  <dig>  random bacs were end-sequenced and, after preliminary screening for length and quality assessments, a total of  <dig>  high-quality bess were generated with success rate of over 90%. among them,  <dig>  sequences were eliminated after masking vector sequences and sequences contaminated with bacterial and organelle genomes using cross_ match and blastn searches  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  bess were generated with an average size of 626 bp. the total bess length was  <dig> ,359 bp with a gc content of  <dig> %, which suggests that wheat is at rich, similar to other cereal genomes  <cit> . the bess constituted  <dig> % of chromosome arm 3as. the distribution of forward and reverse bess displayed a 1: <dig> ratio . tracing back the  <dig>  end-sequenced bac clones to the first phase assembly of the 3as fingerprint map revealed that  <dig>  clones are located in  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons . on an average, six bacs were end-sequenced per contig, theoretically providing coverage of one bes per  <dig>  kb across the chromosome arm. all bess generated herein have been deposited in the genbank databases under the “genbank accession” ei: ei666997-ei <dig> and er772249-er <dig> 

analysis of the repeat fraction and identification of novel repeat elements
the  <dig>  bess accounting for 11 mb of t3as were analyzed sequentially for their repeat and gene content using semi-automated pipeline. based on similarity searches against a repeat database,  <dig> % of the nucleotide sequence corresponded to repetitive sequences . the class i tes  constitute  <dig> % of the sequence, followed by  <dig> % for class ii tes . within the class i tes, long terminal repeat  retrotransposons were the most prominent elements accounting for  <dig> %.the most common repeat families of class i were gypsy-like , followed by copia-like ltr retrotransposons . non-ltr retrotransposons, such as line  and sine , were observed at a much lower frequency . clearly, ltr retrotransposons overshadow non-ltr retrotransposons both in number of matches in bess and percent of sequence. the next most abundant repeats were the class ii tes dna transposons with  <dig>  bess showing homology. the cacta family was the most abundant type of dna transposon accounting for  <dig>  % of the class ii elements.

public repeat databases were used to mask the bess matching to known dna repeat sequences. however, the repeat detection could be limited by the size and diversity of the repeat database, such as the absence of genome and species-specific elements. furthermore, the rapid evolution of repetitive dna elements may lead to the origin of several unknown repetitive dna elements. to identify unknown and wheat-specific repetitive dna elements, the bess were masked with known repetitive elements and then compared to each other. the bess with multiple hits  at high stringency  were identified as repeat sequences. families of repeat sequences were obtained computationally from bess and then subjected to multiple sequence alignment to obtain  <dig> consensus sequences. the consensus sequences were merged at overlapping regions and extended using cap <dig> software  <cit>  and detected  <dig> putative novel repeats with sizes ranging from 199 bp to  <dig>  bp . the putative repeat elements could be considerably longer but, because the average bes length was 623 bp, only a part of the repeats could be identified. the searching of all databases, including trep, repbase and genbank, against putative repeats resulted in the identification of  <dig> protein coding genes representing large gene families,  <dig> of which also matched transposable proteins. the remaining  <dig> repeat elements showed no similarity in blastn or blastx  <cit>  and were termed as triticum novel repeat sequences . the novel, repeat sequences  were analyzed for their presence in wheat chromosome 3a by another blast against bess. these tres were repeated at a higher frequency compared to the initial search in the bess because of the extended length of the repeat sequences. tres <dig> had maximum number of hits in the bess , and the novel repeats totaled  <dig> matches in the bess database . seventeen of the  <dig> tress had a hit on chromosome 3b bess when blastn searched in ncbi nt/nr database.

gene content and functional annotation
after masking the known and putatively new repetitive sequences, the remaining bess were used to estimate the gene content of chromosome arm 3as. the sequences were compared with wheat transcript assemblies  using tblastx and blastn algorithms  <cit> . we found  <dig> unique sequences that were similar  to an est with a cumulative match length of  <dig>  bp, representing about  <dig>  % of the data set. considering the size of 3as as 355 mb, the estimated transcribed fraction of  <dig>  % corresponds to  <dig>  mb in 3as and  <dig>  mb for the entire 3a chromosome. analysis of full-length cdnas in several grass species have shown the average lengths of flcdna varying between  <dig> - <dig>  bp. in  <dig>  oryza sativa and  <dig>  maize flcdnas, the average length was found to be  <dig>  ± 945 bp  <cit>  and  <dig>  bp  <cit> , respectively. in the triticeae tribe, the average length of  <dig>  uni-flcdnas in barley was  <dig>  ± 863 bp  <cit> . considering  <dig>  kb as the average length of a gene based on the average in barley, our results suggest the presence of about  <dig>  genes on the short arm of chromosome 3a and ~ <dig>  genes on chromosome 3a. this estimate is a little lower than the prediction of 7– <dig>  genes in chromosome 3a based on preliminary results from roche/ <dig> sequences of sorted 3a chromosome arms .

the gene estimates for the homoeologous 3b chromosome, which is 20% bigger than 3a, varies from  <dig>  genes based on bes analysis  <cit>  to over  <dig>  to  <dig>  genes, based on sequence analysis of 17 mb of contiguous bac sequences  <cit>  and ~ <dig>  genes based on  <dig> x coverage of sorted chromosome 3b by solexa/illumina sequencing  <cit> . the estimated number of genes on chromosomes 3a and 3b is much higher than the  <dig>  genes predicted for syntenic rice chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . however, the predicted gene numbers may be overestimated, because it is difficult to distinguish bona fide genes from pseudogenes or gene fragments due to the incompleteness of genome or chromosome sequence data.

repeat-masked bess were functionally annotated with blastx searches against the ncbi non-redundant database and functionally classified using blast2go  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  bess had a hit in the database, of which  <dig>  sequences  had a definite hit,  <dig> sequences  hit a transposon and another  <dig> sequence  hit a hypothetical or predicted protein . of  <dig>  sequences, only  <dig> were assigned to go categories, and an enzyme code was identified for only  <dig> sequences . chromosome 3as bess were classified into three categories: biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. a total of  <dig> sequences were classified as biological processes,  <dig> were cellular components and  <dig> were of metabolic function . within the biological process classification, the largest categories were cellular processes  and metabolic processes , followed by biological regulation  . for the cellular components ,  <dig> % of the sequences were cell parts and  <dig> % were membrane-bounded organelles. within the molecular functions class , 46%, 30%, and 22% of the sequences were categorized as transferase activity, hydrolase activity and nucleotide binding, respectively.

comparative sequence composition of homoeologous a, b and d genomes
the homoeologous genomes of wheat have undergone dramatic sequence diversification in the intergenic regions, but have still retained the backbone of gene synteny with their ancestral genomes. a significant amount of representative sequence data was generated from chromosome 3a in the present study and from chromosome 3b  <cit>  and the d genome  <cit> . assuming that a chromosome arm could act as a good representative sample of the genome, we utilized 11 mb bess each from chromosome arm 3as, chromosome 3b  <cit>  and a  <dig>  mb of shotgun sequence from the d genome  <cit>  to compare the composition of homoeologous genomes. our estimate of the repeat content in chromosome 3as  is similar to the 73-82% repeat content of other a-genome chromosomes sequenced by next generation technology from flow-sorted chromosome-arm specific mda dna <cit> . however, mda is known to introduce a bias in the representation of individual amplified regions  <cit> , and a more accurate estimation must await quantitative analysis of the repeat content from flow-sorted chromosome arms dna without the mda step. however, bes information from chromosomes 3as and 3b are the best available sequence samples to compare with homoeologous chromosomes and genomes and, together with next generation sequencing of wheat chromosomes 1a, 4a, 5a, 1b, 7bs, 1d and 7ds, provide a snapshot of the gene content of wheat.

the total repeat fraction in the a genome was  <dig> %, which was less than that of the b genome  and higher than that of the d genome , indicating a positive correlation between te content and genome size. the most abundant retrotransposons in all three genomes were gypsy-like, accounting for 33-53% in the a, b and d genomes, followed by copia-like . the a genome has a higher percentage of copia-like elements compared to the b and d genomes, however, the b genome is richest in gypsy-like elements. interestingly, dna transposons, such as cacta elements, are in significantly higher proportion in the d genome compared to the a and b genomes . the sabrina and fatima elements seem to be the most abundant and have played a key role in expansion of the a genome along with other elements, such as erika, angela and wilma, which form a considerable part of the retroelements in the genome . for chromosome 5a, sabrina , wilma  and fatima  were the most abundant repeats  <cit> . the sabrina, angela, barbara,vagabond, egug and erika elements were significantly higher  in the a genome compared to the b genome based on bess analysis. the ratio of class i elements to class ii elements in the a  and b  genomes is quite similar, whereas it is significantly lower  in the d genome, indicating the significant role of dna transposons in d-genome expansion.

based on the analysis of 3b bess and the reanalysis of the d-genome shotgun sequence  <cit> , paux et al. <cit>  hypothesized that the triticeae genomes have evolved from an ancestral genome of approximately  <dig> gb. the portion of the genome not related to the repetitive sequences in the a genome based on 3as and 5a sequence data is estimated at  <dig>  gb . however, most probably, this is an overestimate, because the wheat repeated sequence database is incomplete and the non-repetitive portion of the d genome based on evidence from bioinformatics and hybridization analyses was just  <dig> %  <cit> .

gc content is an important feature and was quite comparable between chromosomes 3as  and the other a-genome chromosomes 1al  4as  however, the gc content of chromosome 4al  was considerably lower possibly because of biasness caused by mda. the gc content in the b-genome chromosome 3b  was quite similar to that of the a-genome chromosomes of wheat, and the gc content of wheat is comparable to other grasses, such as rye , maize  and rice .

the bess from chromosome 3as were blastn against the  <dig> -loci transcript map recently developed for chromosome 3b  <cit> , and  <dig> bess matched to  <dig> unigenes from chromosome 3b. of these,  <dig> bess ,  <dig> had a hit in rice  or brachypodium  with 70%  of the hits in rice and 77%  in brachypodium in syntenic regions . rustenholz et al.  <cit>  reported 35-42% of unigenes genes mapped on chromosome 3b were non-syntenic in model grasses genomes. our results, based on the sequence from 3a together with 3b unigenes  <cit>  showed that 23-30% of the genes are non-syntenic in wheat, which is consistent with data from chromosome arms 1al, 1bl, and 1dl that showed 20-45% were non-syntenic  <cit> . a similar rate of colinearity was observed for chromosomes 7bs and 7ds with the corresponding region of the brachypodium by sequence analysis of sorted chromosome arms  <cit> . this erosion of colinearity could be explained by a high rate of transposable element activity in hexaploid wheat, such as te-driven gene movement  <cit> . nearly, 40%  bess having a hit to 3b unigenes had no hit in rice or brachypodium. rustenholz et al.  <cit>  reported that 89% of these unigenes were expressed, and we found  <dig> of the  <dig> bess had a hit with barley full-length cdna suggesting these genes are less likely to be pseudogenes. most probably, these genes are less conserved and, therefore, remain undetected in model genomes, however, a few of them could be novel wheat/triticeae-specific genes. in the recent barley genome sequence analysis by meyer et al.  <cit> , similar results were observed where 23% of the barley genes had no sequence similarity in model genomes, although they were expressed in barley.

based on our bes analysis, we estimated one gene per 123 kb and ~ <dig>  genes in the a genome of wheat. vitulo et al.  <cit>  recently sequenced the mda from flow-sorted chromosome 5a of wheat and estimated  <dig>  genes of chromosome 5a and with a gene density of one gene per 162 kb. the coding fraction for chromosome 3as  was comparable to those of chromosome 5a  and 1al . in another sequence analysis and comparison between the chromosome 4a of wheat and model genome brachypodium, hernandez et al.  <cit>  estimated  <dig>  genes on chromosome 4a and ~ <dig>  in the a genome. however, taking into account the large number of pseudogenes and paralogs, they estimated a minimum number of  <dig>  genes on chromosome 4a and  <dig>  in the a genome of wheat  <cit> . the number of genes estimated in our analysis is higher than conservative estimates based on chromosomes 4a and 5a, however, it corresponds well with the recently estimated numbers of genes in the a genome based on bess from chromosome 1al  and the number of genes in the b genome based on 17 mb of bac sequence of chromosome 3b . these estimates are much lower than predicted in earlier studies based on the random sequencing of methylfiltrated libraries  <cit>  and significantly higher than the estimated  <dig>  genes for the d-genome donor ae. tauschii based on bac sequencing  <cit> .

berkman et al.  <cit>  made a very stringent estimate of about  <dig> - <dig>  genes per genome of wheat based on sequence analysis of wheat chromosome arms 7bs and 7ds. however, the estimates made by berkman et al.  <cit>  and hernandez et al.  <cit>  are based on the genome zipper approach. these estimates do not take into account about 23-30% of the genes that lack sufficient sequence similarity to any gene in the three model grass genomes as suggested by meyer et al.  <cit>  in barley and our analysis of 3as bess and 3b unigenes in wheat.

on the other hand, the estimate of gene content by several other studies show that the relatively higher gene content in wheat   <cit>  could be an inflation in the actual number of genes due to misannotations of pseudogenes as all these estimates are based on partial gene sequences or a relatively small data set compared to the large wheat genome. furthermore, recent sequence analysis of the group- <dig> chromosomes of wheat showed that a large number of nonsysntenic genes are present in only one of three wheat genomes and only 60 % of them showed transcriptional evidence, suggesting that most of them are pseudogenes  <cit>  making annotation of genes based on sequence similarity suboptimal. we may have a better estimate of the gene content once full-length gene sequences and a gold standard reference sequence of wheat becomes available allowing us to differentiate between genes and gene fragments.

comparison to model grass genomes
repeat-masked bess were used for a comparative analysis with other model grass genomes. the 3as bess were subjected to a similarity search against rice chromosome  <dig>  brachypodium chromosome  <dig> and sorghum chromosome  <dig> and also to chromosome 3b bess using blastn. there were  <dig> hits to rice chromosome  <dig>   <dig> on brachypodium chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> to sorghum chromosome  <dig> . there were  <dig> hits to 3b bess demonstrating a high level of homology, as expected. the 3a bess, when aligned to a model grass genome based on sequence similarity and ordered based on brachypodium, showed a mosaic of synteny . the short arm of chromosome 3a showed a high level of synteny with short arm of rice chromosome  <dig>  sorghum chromosome  <dig> and brachypodium chromosome  <dig> . sequence hits were distributed all along chromosome 3as with a mean of  <dig>  hits/mb of sequence and range of 0– <dig> hits/mb of sequence, however, the density of hits were higher towards the distal end of the chromosome, which could be due to higher gene density in terminal part of the chromosome  <cit> . a similar trend of increased gene density towards the distal end of the chromosome was seen in chromosome 3b  <cit> . the bess hit  <dig> bins  in rice chromosome  <dig> with a mean of  <dig>  hits per bin and range of 0– <dig> hits per mb of sequence. in brachypodium chromosome  <dig>  the mean number of hits per mb of sequence was  <dig>  with range of 0– <dig> hits/mb of sequence. in sorghum chromosome  <dig>  the mean hits per mb of sequence were  <dig> . our comparative analysis validates the high synteny  between the short arm of chromosome 3a with the short arms of rice chromosome  <dig>  brachypodium chromosome  <dig> and sorghum chromosome  <dig> .

molecular markers from 3as
in order to identify new putative markers for physical and genetic mapping,  <dig>  bess were analyzed for the presence of ssrs, which could be converted into microsatellite markers. a total of  <dig>  perfect repeats of di-, tri- and tetranucleotide repeats were identified. the frequency of ssrs derived from the bess was about one ssr per  <dig>  kb . the most abundant of these ssrs were dinucleotide  <dig>  and trinucleotide  <dig> ; tetranucleotides were rare . nearly 28% of ssrs  were at rich . a comparison of the frequency and distribution of the ssrs between the a and b genomes of wheat indicates a higher density of ssrs on chromosome 3b  compared to chromosome 3as . furthermore, the dinucleotide motif n was most abundant  on chromosome 3as in contrast to the trinucleotide motif , which was the most abundant in wheat chromosome 3b  <cit> . other species, such as brachypodium, rice and maize, also have a higher frequency of trinucleotide motifs, however, species such as papaya show a higher frequency of dinucleotide motifs and soybean had higher frequency of tetranucleotide motifs  <cit> . in our study, the frequency of ssrs on chromosome 3as is far lower than that of chromosome 3b. the higher frequency of at-rich di- and trinucleotide motifs in wheat and maize suggests that at-rich region are associated with repetitive sequences, in contrast to gc-rich regions, which are associated with the transcribed part of the genome.

microsatellite primer pairs were successfully developed from  <dig> out of  <dig>  ssrs. of the  <dig> ssrs primer pairs,  <dig> were developed from class i microsatellites with more than nine motif repeats . the bess were also processed to identify junctions between te and other sequences using isbpfinder.pl  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  insertion sites were identified in  <dig>  bess, and primer pairs were successfully designed from  <dig> suitable junctions . a repeat was identified every  <dig>  kb on t3as, whereas a repeat was identified every  <dig>  kb on t1al  <cit> , suggesting that repeat-based makers could play an important role in the saturation mapping of the wheat genome. a set of  <dig> class i ssrs and  <dig> isbp primer pairs were tested by pcr amplification for 3as specificity and utility across species.

for testing 3as specificity, primer pairs were amplified on genomic dna of a 3as bac pool, chinese spring , and the cs aneuploids n3at3b , dt3as  and dt3al . an isbp primer pair was considered 3as specific if it did not amplify a product from n3at3b or dt3al but amplified products from all other stocks . nearly 18% of the ssrs did not produce amplicons from n3at3b or dt3al suggesting these markers had 3as specificity . twenty-nine percent of the isbp primer pairs did not amplify from n3atb or dt3al indicating their specificity to 3as . however, all the isbp and issr markers that amplified from cs  also amplified from the cs t3as bac library super pools, suggesting that they are present on chromosome 3as. the nonspecificity of nearly two-thirds of the isbp and four-fifths of the ssrs markers may be attributed to a combination of several factors including amplification from the homoeologous chromosomes, t3as has a portion of the long arm of chromosome 3a, flow-sorted chromosome arm-based libraries have a reported 10-13 % contamination  <cit> ; duplications on other wheat chromosomes, because microsatellites have a high possibility of being moved by transposable elements; or bias in the sample tested.

nearly, 53%  of isbps designed from 1al bess were 1al specific  <cit> , suggesting that because the first primer is designed from repeat and the second one from unique sequences, the high specificity of the unique sequences becomes very significant for specific amplification.

the set of  <dig> class i ssrs and  <dig> isbp primer pairs were also tested by pcr amplification on wheat genotypes, the parents of three mapping populations: cultivated diploid wheat  and wild diploid wheat ; tetraploid wheat  genotypes langdon and langdon dic-3a; and bread wheat genotypes cs, opata  <dig> and synthetic w <dig> . more than 93% of the ssr and 97% of isbp primer pairs gave amplification from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. twenty-six percent  isbps and 16%  ssrs were found polymorphic between parents of diploid mapping population t. monococcum and t. aegilopoides on 3% agarose gels. to eliminate the effect of amplification from 3b and 3d, we are mapping these markers in a diploid wheat  t. monococcum subsp. monococcum/subsp. aegilopoides ril population . amplification of the primer pairs from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat shows their reproducibility and wide adaptability of these markers.

in summary, a total of  <dig>  new  putative markers have been developed spanning the 3as arm, which adds over 200% more markers than mapped in all previous studies  on this arm. the universality and variability of ssrs make these sequences an attractive source of developing microsatellite markers. however, because most of the genome  is repetitive, the isbp repeat insertion-based markers could be very important in saturating markers in this portion of the genome and, thus, could enhance the efficiency of breeding programs. the potential of such repeat-based markers in crop breeding for high-throughput, marker-assisted selection has been suggested by paux et al.  <cit> . more than  <dig> genes and qtls related to domestication traits, such as brittle rachis; tillering; disease resistance genes against stem rust, leaf rust, tanspot, and septoria tritici blotch; and agronomic traits such as preharvest sprouting and root-shoot biomass, have been genetically mapped on chromosome 3as of wheat   <cit> . in addition to the  <dig>  molecular markers  developed in the present study, we have obtained sequence tags of  <dig> of the estimated ~ <dig>  genes on chromosome 3as. the  <dig>  molecular markers plus  <dig> sequence tags of genes will aid in marker-assisted selection and the map-based cloning of above-mentioned agronomic traits on 3as arm. the molecular markers will also help to align the physical and genetic maps of chromosome 3as.

CONCLUSIONS
bess are a valuable genomic resource for genome organization analysis, comparative genomics and marker development. analysis of  <dig>  3as bess revealed differences in the repeat landscape of the a- and b-genome homoeologous chromosomes and estimate of gene content, triticum-specific and genome-specific genes. we also developed bess-derived microsatellite and isbp putative markers as a resource for integrating physical and genetic maps and for mapping and cloning of a large number of agronomically important genes on 3as arm.
