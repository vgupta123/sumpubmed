BACKGROUND

elymus nutans griseb., is an important alpine perennial forage of pooideae subfamily, and mainly distributed on the qinghai-tibet plateau and in the himalayas  <cit> . due to its high adaptability, good source of nutrients, high yield, and resistance to various abiotic stresses, such as low temperature, high radiation, and large diurnal temperature changes, it is often used for ecological restoration and the construction of artificial grasslands  <cit> . to understand the mechanism of how e. nutans resists low temperature limitations, a better understanding of the gene expression profile of e. nutans under cold stress is imperative. this is because it could be an ideal model to study cold tolerance mechanisms for the purpose of improving the quality of cold resistance in other cold sensitive plants.

cold stress is a major abiotic factor that limits plant growth, development, survival and productivity  <cit> . to overcome this barrier, plants have evolved various adaptive mechanisms that trigger a cascade of events leading to changes in gene expression and subsequently to physiochemical modifications that enhance their cold tolerance  <cit> . the physiological response includes: induction of transient increases in ca2+ and aba levels  <cit> , alterations in lipid composition, increases in antioxidant levels, and the accumulation of osmoprotectants  <cit> .

gene-expression changes that have been induced by stress form a key components of the molecular mechanisms by which plants adapt to environmental challenges  <cit> . numerous studies provide evidence of global changes in gene expression in response to cold stress  and these changes highlight the importance of transcriptional regulation in plant adaptation to cold stress. for example, cold stress induced around  <dig> genes in sheepgrass, while more than 2 % of wheat genome showed different expression patterns in response to cold  <cit> . numerous cold regulated genes encode transcription factors or proteins are involved in transcription  <cit> . among these, the c-repeat binding factor /dehydration responsive element provides one of the most important pathways for cold response. cold-induced cbfs, which are members of the apetala2/ethylene response factor  gene family, can activate cold response  genes by binding to the cis-acting elements in their promoters  <cit> . many of cor genes, such as dehydrin, encode cryoprotective proteins that protect plant cells against cold-induced damage  <cit> . in barley, several dehyrin related genes, dhn <dig>  dhn <dig> and dhn <dig> accumulate in response to cold  <cit> . however, so far, the cold stress-response mechanism in e. nutans remains to be identified.

to elucidate physiological and transcriptomic adaptive mechanisms in e. nutans, the wild dx and variety gn were exposed to  <dig> °c for different time courses. our physiochemical study demonstrated that dx had better cold tolerance than gn. as seen by lower electrolyte leakage level, low lipid peroxidation, and the maintenance of higher photosynthetic activity under cold stress. here, comparative transcriptome analyses were performed to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of cold tolerance in e. nutans. identification of cold-responsive genes encoding transcription factors, signal transduction, enzymes involved in primary and secondary metabolism as well as specific dehydrin genes provided a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underling the response to cold stress in this species.

RESULTS
the dx genotype has a better cold tolerance compared with gn genotype
to elucidate the physiological responses of both genotypes exposed to cold stress, biomass and several important physiological indices were measured. cold stress relatively reduced the plant fresh weight of gn but not of dx . concurrent with growth inhibition, there was a lower relative water content in gn than dx exposed to 24 h and  <dig> d of cold treatment . malondialdehyde , a product of lipid peroxidation, considered as an indicator of oxidative injury under abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> . mda content and electrolyte leakage levels increased  in both plants under 24 h and  <dig> d of cold stress, while a smaller increase in these values was observed in dx , indicating lower oxidative damage in dx under cold stress. dx accumulated  higher proline than gn in both control and stressed conditions . these results suggest that the dx genotype was more cold-tolerant than gn genotype.

transcriptome assembly and annotation
to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying differential cold tolerance in dx and gn, twenty-four cdna libraries were created from three independent biological samples of four treatments  and sequenced using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> sequencing platform. more than 65 m high-quality pair-end reads were retrieved after trimming for each rna-seq sample. sequencing was done on the illumina platform generating paired end reads of 100 bp each. cleaned reads were de novo assembled using trinity software: a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts with a n <dig> of  <dig> and 1777 bp were generated in dx and gn genotypes, respectively . this indicates a high quality assembly. the size distribution of transcripts was shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig> 

to validate and annotate the of assembled unigenes, using e-value < 1e- <dig>  they were blast searched against seven public databases, including nr, nt, cog, go, kegg, swissprot, and interpro protein database. in total,  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes in the dx and gn assemblies were found in at least one of these databases . overall, the unigene sequences were most similar to gene sequences from hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare, aegilops tauschii, triticum urartu, brachypodium distachyon via blastx matches .

to characterize the functional classifications of annotated unigenes, go and kegg analyses were performed to access the distributions of functional categories. a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes were annotated in go for dx and gn, respectively, and classified into  <dig> functional groups, including  <dig> groups in biological process,  <dig> in molecular function, and  <dig> in cellular components . in total,  <dig>   unigeness in dx and  <dig>   in gn were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. these unigenes were mainly involved in ‘translation’, ‘lipid metabolism’, and ‘transport and catabolism’ .

gene expression under cold stress
differential gene expression was analyzed relative to a control  grown under control conditions. to characterize the differentially expressed genes  over the  <dig> d of cold exposure, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> degs | >2) were identified and analyzed for the dx and gn genotypes, respectively . most of the cold regulated degs are late-response genes. in dx,  <dig>  unigenes were induced/repressed exclusively at  <dig> d of cold treatment, while only  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were specific at  <dig> or 24 h of cold treatment. a similar change in degs over time was observed in gn, starting from  <dig> degs after 3 h to  <dig> degs after  <dig> d of cold stress . for all comparisons in pairs, we identified  <dig> degs in dx and  <dig> in gn, and only  <dig> degs were commonly regulated for both genotypes , indicating that the cold-induced transcriptomic responses were largely genotype specific. a total of  <dig> degs | >2) were identified between the treated and control dx and gn plants . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> degs in the dx and gn genotypes represented  <dig> common response genes  at all time points. while  <dig> genes were specifically regulated for each time point in dx and gn, illustrating a high species-specific transcriptomic plasticity in response to cold stress .fig.  <dig> transcriptional profiles of dx and gn genotypes after  <dig> to  <dig> d of cold exposure. a venn diagram showing the number of differentially expressed genes  in dx and gn genotypes under cold stress compared with control plants. b the number of degs common and specific for dx and gn during cold stress. c the number of dx and gn uniquely expressed genes among  <dig> degs between the two genotypes. d hierarchical clustering  analysis of the common expressed degs from the rna-seq in dx and gn 




a hierarchical cluster analysis  was performed to characterize the expression patterns of the common expressed degs after cold exposure. a large proportion of degs in dx and gn followed a similar expression pattern after 24 h and  <dig> d of cold treatment, which clustered together. in contrast, expression profile of 3 h-exposed plants clustered separately, this indicated obvious differences in the global gene expression patterns at early and later phases of cold stress in the two genotypes .

pathways enrichment analysis of degs
using the kegg database, pathways displaying significant changes  in response to the cold treatment were identified in both genotypes . in the 3 h cold treatment sample,  <dig> and  <dig> kegg pathways were significantly enriched in dx and gn, respectively. among the top  <dig> enriched pathways, ‘mrna surveillance pathway ’, ‘circadian rhythm – plant ’, and ‘rna transport ’ were common regulated in response to 3 h cold stress in both genotypes. the intermediate and late phases of the cold response were characterized by protective response through modulating cellular metabolic homeostasis. in the 24 h cold treatment sample the enriched pathway were similar to those at  <dig> d in both genotypes. in dx, ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ’, ‘cyanoamino acid metabolism ’, and ‘galactose metabolism ’ were the top three enriched pathways after 24 h and  <dig> d of cold stress. in gn, ‘glutathione metabolism ’, ‘flavonoid biosynthesis ’, ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites ’, ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ’, and ‘flavone and flavonol biosynthesis ’ were the most significantly enriched.

early gene-expression changes in response to cold stress
to gain insight into the functional categories of common and genotype-specific degs induced by 3 h of cold stress, go term annotations were analyzed. for genes that were detected in the two genotypes at 3 h, the top enriched go categories were invovled in ‘transcription factors ’ and ‘signal transduction’. numerous genotype-specific tfs and signaling molecules were detected during early cold stress, indicating that dx and gn activated the downstream defense response through different signal transduction and transcriptional regulation pathways.

transcription factor plays a key role in the regulation of upstream cold signal transduction which are capable of activating a cascade of downstream gene transcript  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes encoding tfs belonging to  <dig> families were differentially expressed in both genotypes after 3 h of cold exposure . these tfs were asssociated with response to abiotic and biotic stresses and the regulation of developmental processes, including ap2-erebp, basic helix–loop–helix , myb-related, mads, nac, basic leucine zipper , cysteine-2/histidine- <dig> zinc finger proteins -dof, and heat shock transcription factors . cbfs were the most represented subfamily with  <dig> members, including five dx-specific and  <dig> gn-specific genes. additionally, other tfs such as bzip, bhlh, nac were cold-regulated in the two plants . mads, sigma70-like, and alfin-like subfamliy tfs were uniquely expressed in dx .fig.  <dig> heat map showing the expression profiles of transcription factor families in dx and gn genotypes. yellow indicates the up-regulated genes and blue down-regulated genes




when suffering from unfavorable conditions, plants could trigger multiple stress-responsive signal transduction pathways that activate gene transcription and the downstream physiological adaptation  <cit> . two dx-specific ca2+ signaling-related genes, glutamate receptor  <dig>   and calmodulin-binding transcription activator  <dig> , were induced during 3 h of cold stress and two gn-specific, glutamate receptor  <dig>   and cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig>  were induced during this time frame. additionally, the up-regulation of calmodulin-like protein  <dig>  was higher in dx, suggesting cml <dig> might contribute to higher cold tolerance in dx . protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been implicated in cold signal transduction, including  <dig> genes annotated as encoding protein kinases and phosphatases in both genotypes . ten genes related to phytosulfokine receptor  <dig> were over-accumulated in both genotypes, indicating that phytosulfokine receptor signaling may play an important role in regulating the early cold signalings in e. nutans.

we also observed metabolic changes after 3 h of cold stress, indicated by the go term ‘biosynthetic process’ . for example, early changes involved in secondary metabolism processes, such as the induction of genes encoding flavonoid and lignin biosynthesis  were detected after 3 h . furthermore, lipid metabolism changed during cold stress, indicated by up-regulation of genes coding wax, suberin , and fatty acid biosynthesis . genes coding sucrose: sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase  indicated the need for the regulation of fructan biosynthesis. moreover, the early response encompassed the accumulation of numberous cold responsive protein-coding genes .

in order to further identify specific metabolic pathways differentially affected by early cold stress in dx and gn leaves, a kegg enrichment analysis  was performed. several different metabolic pathways were affected by early cold stress in both genotypes, including mrna surveillance pathway ’, ‘circadian rhythm – plant ’, ‘rna transport ’, and ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites ’ . in the class of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, most enzymes of stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis  and flavonoid biosynthesis  were specifically induced in both genotypes. in addtion, seven genes of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  were specifically induced in dx in response to early cold stress. specifically, most genes of starch and sucrose metabolism , galactose metabolism , and cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis  were induced in dx during the early cold stress .

degs in response to intermediate and late phases of the cold stress
the intermediate and late phases of the cold response were characterized by increased lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, carbohydrate metabolism, secondary metabolism, and photosynthetic process.

‘lipid metabolism process’  and ‘lipid transport’  were significantly induced in both genotypes during the intermediate and late stress treatment. a total of  <dig> lipid metabolism-related genes were identified, most of them involved in oxylipin, wax, cutin, suberin, sterol, and fatty acid biosynthetic and metabolic processes . genotype-specific regulation was prominent, as different genes—albeit with similar functions—were affected in the two genotypes. genes encoding wax biosynthesis were strongly up-regulated at 24 h and  <dig> d in dx. three oxylipin biosynthesis-related genes exhibited higher expression in dx, indicating oxylipin might contribute to better cold tolerance in dx. notably, an approximately  <dig> fold increase in the gene encoding fatty acid desaturase  was observed after cold treatment at  <dig> d in dx .fig.  <dig> heat map showing the expression profiles of lipid metabosim-related genes in dx and gn genotypes. yellow indicates the up-regulated genes and blue down-regulated genes




cold stress resulted in a higher reactive oxygen species  accumulation and lower antioxidant enzyme activities in gn compared with dx , which might contribute to lower oxidative damage in dx. to further characterize the differences in ros-related gene expression between tolerant and sensitive genotypes, cold-responsive genes related to ros were analyzed. in all,  <dig> genes coding ros producing and detoxification, including  <dig> in dx,  <dig> in gn and  <dig> in both genotypes , were identified as having significantly different expression profiles after late cold treatment. consistent with higher production of ros in gn, several genes coding respiratory burst oxidase protein and polyamine oxidase , invovled in the generation of ros, were more strongly induced by the late cold stress in gn than in dx . eighty-three degs were identified as encoding enzymes associated with ros scavenging, including peroxidase , catalase , ascorbate peroxidase , monodehydroasorbate reductase , glutathione s-transferase , glutathione peroxidase , polyphenol oxidase , glutaredoxin, thioredoxin. among the antioxidant enzymes we identified, gst and pod play the most important roles in scavenging ros in both plants. moreover, the induction of several genes involved in polyamine and tocopherol biosynthesis in both genotypes, were also noteworthy .fig.  <dig> heat map showing the expression profiles of ros-related genes in dx and gn genotypes. yellow indicates the up-regulated genes and blue down-regulated genes




carbohydrate metabolism was affected by cold stress in both genotypes . fructan plays important roles in response to cold stress, corroborated by the induction of 1-sst and differential expression of fructan 6-exohydrolase  in both plants . the fructan content was increased around two-fold in gn and five-fold in dx during  <dig> d of cold treatment. consistent with increased concentrations in sucrose, fructose, and raffinose, enzymes such as sucrose synthase  <dig>  beta-amylase, alpha-amylase isozyme c, and galactinol synthase  <dig> , were induced in both plants. additionally, cold stress increased the abundance of alpha, alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase  transcript by  <dig> -fold in dx at  <dig> d under cold stress.fig.  <dig> carbohydrate metabosim in response to cold stress. a heat map showing the expression profiles of genes related to carbohydrate metabosim in dx and gn genotypes. yellow indicates the up-regulated genes and blue down-regulated genes. changes in fructan , sucrose, fructose, and raffinose  content over time. each value represents the mean of three replicates ± se shown by the vertical error bar. the letters above the bars indicate a significant difference at the  <dig>  level according to duncan’s multiple range test




the ‘secondary metabolism’ category also showed genotype-specificity in both plants. in all,  <dig> genes encoding secondary metabolism biosynthesis, including  <dig> dx specificity,  <dig> gn specificity and  <dig> commonly expressed . flavonoids and stilbenes have ros-scavenging activity that protects against oxidative damage and controls ros levels under abiotic stresses  <cit> . most of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway responded late in the cold, with higher expression in dx than in gn. in the stilbenes biosynthesis pathway, one putative o-methyltransferase  <dig>  was upregulated by  <dig> -fold in dx and trans-resveratrol di-o-methyltransferase  was induced by  <dig> -fold in gn. in dx tropane alkaloid, caffeine, menthol and paclitaxel biosynthesis were induced uniquely, this contrasted with gn in which benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis was exclusively depressed. lignin metabolism was significatly enriched in both genotypes. altered pathways included, for example, the up-regulation of lignin catabolism and down-regulation of ligin biosynthesis in gn .fig.  <dig> heat map showing the expression profiles of secondary metabosim-related genes in dx and gn genotypes. yellow indicates the up-regulated genes and blue down-regulated genes




numerous genes encoding components of photosystem i  and psii declined significantly during the intermediate and late phases of cold treatment. over-represented go terms describing sets of declining genes after 24 h and  <dig> d encompassed: ‘photosynthesis’ , chloroplast thylakoid membrane , and photosynthesis, light harvesting  . additionally, six genes encoding chlorophyll a biosynthesis significantly decreased in both genotypes, including protochlorophyllide reductase  and glutaminyl-trna synthetase . indeed, chlorophyll content had a marked reduction in both plants under cold stress, showing a greater reduction in gn compared to dx . transcriptome analysis showed that psii was inhibited more severely in gn . to confirm this, pam was used to determine the maximum quantum efficiency of psii , apparent electron transport rate , and non-photochemical quenching . during cold stress, fv/fm and etr decreased, whereas npq increased in both plants. dx maintained higher fv/fm, etr, and lower npq than gn under cold stress .fig.  <dig> changes in photosynthesis-related parameters in dx and gn under cold stress. a chlorophyll content,  the maximum photosystem ii quantum yield ,  apparent electron transport rate , and  non-photochemical quenching . each value represents the mean of three replicates ± se shown by the vertical error bar. the letters above the bars indicate a significant difference at the  <dig>  level according to duncan’s multiple range test




genes involved in specific metabolic pathways and cellular response processes in both genotypes were further analysed using kegg enrichment analysis. the intermediate and late phases of the cold response were characterized by protective response through modulating cellular metabolic homeostasis, which is reflected by the largest numbers of metabolic pathways  in both genotypes in response to the prolonged cold stress. a variety of different biochemical pathways were affected by cold stress in both plants, including cartbohydratre metabolism, energy generation, lipid metabolism, and secondary metabolism . in the category of lipid metabolism, genes of sterol biosynthetic process , alpha-linolenic acid metabolism , and most cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis  were induced in dx during the late cold stress, while genes of alpha-linolenic acid metabolism pathway in gn were down-regulated. induction of glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis pathways  in dx leaves is essential to avoid energy starvation caused by reduced photosynthesis under late cold stress. flavonoid biosynthesis  and stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis  were significantly enriched in the dx and gn leaves exposed the prolonged cold stress. majority genes involved in these processes were up-regulated in both genotypes, except genes of flavonoid biosynthesis in 24 h-treated gn leaves. the transcriptomes of the dx and gn leaves further displayed an enrichment of the category protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum  in response to late cold stress .

aba metabolism and signalling in response to cold stress
aba is an important stress hormone that mediates abiotic stress responses in plants  <cit> . the genes involved in the aba response increased over time in both genotypes. this is supported by the over-represented go term ‘response to abscisic acid stimulus’  and ‘abscisic acid mediated signaling pathway’  seen after  <dig> d of cold treatment, especially in dx genotype . six aba synthesis-related genes, encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase and a probable aldehyde oxidase, were induced in both genotypes. aba catabolism contained genes abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase  <dig>  and abscisate beta-glucosyltransferase  were exclusively induced in gn, while abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase  <dig>  declined only in dx. we further meaured the aba content in both plants. aba levels immediately increased in both genotypes in response to cold, with dx showing this effect to a greater extent .fig.  <dig> changes in aba content during the time course. each value represents the mean of three replicates ± se shown by the vertical error bar. the letters above the bars indicate a significant difference at the  <dig>  level according to duncan’s multiple range test




dehydrins function as candidate genes regulating cold tolerance
numerous cor genes were induced during the cold stress in both genotypes . most cor genes were expressed at common levels of expression, indicating these cor genes were conserved in regulating down-stream defense responses in both genotypes. four genes encoding dehydrin  and cold shock protein  over-accumulated only in dx. while two late embryogenesis abundant protein-related genes  were induced exclusively in gn. dhn <dig> was induced in dx but repressed in gn at the later stages of cold stress. genes encoding lea14-a, cold-regulated  <dig> plasma membrane protein , dehydrin , and cold-responsive protein  had higher transcriptional abundance in dx compared with gn, indicating those cors may contribute to the enhanced cold tolerance in dx. in contrast, dhn <dig> and lea <dig> were much stronger over-represented in gn than in dx .

co-expression network and regulatory interactions
in order to further clarify the regulatory network induced by cold stress in both genotypes, a co-expression network analysis was performed using pearson correlation thresholds  <cit> . in total,  <dig> and  <dig> genes formed a cold-responsive co-expression network in dx and gn, respectively . these networks were directly connected with each other via  <dig> edges in dx and  <dig> edges in gn, suggesting that the coexpressed genes are most likely coregulated. twenty-six of these coexpressed genes  were strongly interconnected, with each gene having more than  <dig> edges . these genes were therefore defined as hub genes. these hub genes were directly connected to each other via  <dig> edges in dx and  <dig> edges in gn, forming a highly interconnected subnetwork. twenty-two hub genes  were annotated as cor , reflecting their central roles in the acquisition of cold tolerance.

validation of gene expression profiles by qrt-pcr
to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of this illumina rna-seq result,  <dig> degs including  <dig> hub genes were chosen for qrt-pcr. these genes were from various functional categories include signaling, transcript factor, metabolism, and cold-responsive protein. the primer sequences, fpkm and qrt-pcr result are listed in additional file 28: table s <dig> and additional file 29: figure s <dig>  all  <dig> genes in the two genotypes showed the same expression patterns in the qrt-pcr assays as in the rna-seq data . this independent evaluation revealed the reliability of the rna-seq data.

discussion
the study provides a profile of the physiological and global transcriptomic response induced by cold stress in two e. nutans genotypes which display contrasting cold tolerance profiles, the wild dx and variety gn. our physiochemical data demonstrated that cold stress resulted in more severe oxidative damage and growth suppression in gn than in dx, suggesting that dx is more cold-tolerant compared with gn. proline acts as an osmolyte and the enhanced accumulation in plant cell lead to increased stress tolerance because of its biological function in retaining water in cells and reduce the rate of water loss in response to cold stress  <cit> . consistent with this notion, higher proline accumulation and lower water loss observed in dx may account for the higher tolerance of dx to cold stress.

a whole-transcriptome analysis was performed in both cold-stressed and unstressed plants to obtain new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the cold stress response in both genotypes. for each sample from the two genotypes, more than 65 m high-quality clean reads were obtained, which were de novo assembled into  <dig>  transcripts with a n <dig> of 1809 bp were generated in dx and  <dig>  transcripts with a n <dig> of 1777 bp in gn, respectively, which indicates a high quality assembly that is likely to include many full-length cdnas. a greater length of n <dig> in dx compared with gn may be the result from the larger number of longer fragment transcripts in dx. in addition,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the assembled transcripts had homologs in at least one of the public databases that we searched, and  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the transcripts had a homolog that was determined with a high probability score in four species  in dx and gn, respectively. taken together, these results suggested that our e. nutans est dataset represents a valuable transcriptome resource for gene discovery and functional analysis. it has been demonstrated that plants can enhance their cold tolerance by the induction or repression of gene transcripts in response to cold stress  <cit> . in this study, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified in dx and gn genotypes, respectively. most of the cold-regulated genes are late-response genes, in agreemet with the reports by lee et al.  <cit> . approximately 18 % of the dx or gn degs had no annotated homologs in the public database, therefore these may be specific to e. nutans or represent cold-responsive genes with homologs that have not been identified in previous studies with other plant species.

different signaling and transcription factors mediate early cold stress responses
plants under stress can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways that activate gene transcription and the concomitant downstream pathways responsible for physiological adaptation. ca2+ is an important second messenger in plants and a key component in the signalling network by which plant cells respond to cold signals  <cit> . consistent with the expected role of ca2+ in early cold signal transduction, we identified six up-regulated ca2+ signaling-related genes at 3 h of cold stress. cbl proteins are known to interact with a group of serine/threonine protein kinases referred to as cipks  <cit> . the cbl–cipk pathway has been reported to mediate plant responses to various environmental stresses, such as cold, drought and salinity  <cit> . the identification of cipk <dig> gene was exclusively induced in gn suggests that cbl-cipk pathway may contribute to regulate cold response in the gn genotype. additionally, plants can induce protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation signals to withstand early cold stress. our results showed that numerous protein kinases and phosphatases was the largest group among the signaling category in both genotypes, which is consistent with the resports by lee et al.  <cit>  in the arabidopsis cold-responsive transcriptome.

another prominent difference between the early cold responses of the e. nutans genotypes studied, was the large number of uniquely induced tfs. most of these tfs belonged to the same families, such as ap2/erebp, wrkys, nacs, and mybs. tfs play a key role in the regulation of upstream cold signals, which are capable of activating a cascade of downstream gene transcripts  <cit> . in the present study, the largest cold-inducible tf group belonged to the ap2/erebp family and was composed of  <dig> members, which has been shown by some to be one of the best characterized cbfs in the cold regulatory pathway. the induced cbfs function to enhance cold tolerance in arabidopsis and other plants  <cit> . our results therefore suggest that the cbf pathway is conserved in e. nutans responses to the cold stress. other tfs including nac, bhlh, bzip, c2h <dig>  wrky, myb, and hsf families were also exclusively induced in both genotypes. previous studies have shown that members of these families function in cold tolerance  <cit> . moreover, three dx-specific tfs belonging to mads, sigma70-like, and alfin-like subfamlies were differentially expressed, which may indicate that these tfs play important roles in coordinating genes involved in protective mechanisms in dx. together, we speculate that the different tf transcripts in dx and gn may partially explain the different transcriptome changes induced by cold stress in the two genotypes.

cold stress signalling induces cellular protection processes
the complex interplay of different signaling pathways and multiple tfs co-ordinates the cellular response to cold stress that includes adjustments of the membrane system, cellular redox state, and primary and secondary metabolism  <cit> . the effect of cold stress on cellular membrane properties is alleviated by membrane lipid restablishment. a group of lipid metabolism-related genes were already characterized in cold-treated dx and gn plants, including those encoding wax biosynthesis, cutin and suberin biosynthesis, sterol biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and lipid transport and metabolism, were identified. wax biosynthesis and deposition have been reported to be associated with the regulation of abiotic stresses tolerance  <cit> . oxylipin and wax might play important roles in the regulation of cold tolerance in both genotypes, indicated by high transcripts of their biosynthesis-related genes. a gene encoding fatty acid desaturase was strongly induced in dx and gn at  <dig> d under cold stress, which contributes to the protection of both plants from cold injury by regulating the fluidity of the cellular membrane  <cit> . these findings strongly suggest that lipid metabolism in e. nutans might be essential for the adaptation to cold stress.

ros are frequently accumulated when plants suffered from environmental stress. ros can function as a signal to trigger stress-related responses and they can also cause oxidative damage to plant cells  <cit> . cold-treated dx and gn plants showed different ros and mda accumulation which is indicator of oxidative damage. to avoid the oxidative burst, plants possess a complex antioxidative defense system composed of nonenzymatic and enzymatic components. genes encoding gst, pod, asa-gsh cycle, prx/trx pathway, and ppo were detected in both plants; these genes have been shown to be involved in scavenging ros under abiotic stress  <cit> . higher sod, cat, apx and gr activities were measured in cold-treated dx indicating that higher efficiency in the balance of ros production. furthermore, the transriptome results also showed the up-regulation of nonenzymic antioxidants in dx, including tocopherol, gsh, and polyamine, which have been reported to function in elevating stress tolerance  <cit> . these results will help in broader understanding of the enhanced cold tolerance in dx partially resulted from ros pathways modulation.

sugar accumulation is a fundamental component of enhanced low temperature tolerance and acts in concert with the cor gene products  <cit> . fructan, sucrose, fructose, and raffinose probably act as osmoprotectants to stabilize cellular membranes and a scavenger of ros to protect plants against oxidative damage exposed to cold  <cit> . this was observed mainly in dx, where the greater accumulation of these sugars and higher induction of biosynthesis-related genes were over-represented at later phases of cold stress. similar results have been reported in cold-treated perennial ryegrass  <cit> . the accumulation of trehalose is a protective strategy plants employ by using oxidative detoxification against environmental challenges  <cit> . specific induction of tps <dig> in dx combined with higher induction of tpp <dig>  in dx than in gn over the entire stress may reflect higher trehalose accumulation in the acquisition of cold tolerance.

in addition to activate primary mechanisms of ros detoxification, the two plants also induce secondary mechanisms leading to the biosynthesis of other types of secondary metabolites. flavonoids act as ros scavengers that protect against oxidative damage under abiotic stress  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes were detected and most of them responded late in the cold in both genotypes, with higher expression in dx than in gn. this result suggests that the activation of flavonoid metabolism at the late stage may be a adaptation mechanism of the plant to cold stress in e. nutans. this was consistent with the findings by li et al.  <cit>  who pointed out that the accumulated flavonoids protected petunias against cold damage. similarly, corso et al.  <cit>  reported that flavonoid biosynthetic genes were induced in a drought-tolerant grapevine genotype. additionally, other secondary metabolites biosynthesis-related genes such as those encoding dx-specific tropane alkaloid, caffeine, menthol, paclitaxel and gn-specific benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis may play an important role in the prevention of oxidative injury against cold stress.

photosynthesis was inhibited under cold stress
photosynthesis is a fundamental metabolic process for plant growth development, and this process is very sensitive to low temperatures  <cit> . in this study, we find that photosynthesis was inhibited by cold stress, and more related genes were down-regulated in gn than dx. cold stress inhibited the transcription of chlorophyll biosynthesis-related genes and decreased chlorophyll content in both genotypes, but the decrease was greater in gn. down-regulation of photosynthesis is affected by reduced activites of key photosynthesis-related enzymes under cold stress  <cit> . three photosynthetic enzymes related genes encoding ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit  and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase b  showed exclusively differential expression in both plants. psii was inhibited more severely in gn, as characterized by suppression of the genes encoding chlorophyll a/b binding proteins and the photosystem ii reaction center psb <dig>  this agrees with the chlorophyll fluorescence data determined with pam showing that dx maintained higher fv/fm, etr, and lower npq relative to gn. the inhibition of photosynthesis-related genes under cold stress has also been observed in barley  <cit> .

aba plays an important role in regulating cold tolerance
aba functions as a stress hormone that regulates nearly 10 % of the protein-coding genes under various abiotic stress conditions  <cit> . a rapid increase in aba content in both plants was observed at 3 h, but subsequently the levels remained constant with only slight changes in both plants. interestingly, aba synthesis-related genes were induced together with down-regulation of aba catabolism in dx during the late of cold stress, which is consistent with the report by yoshioka et al.  <cit> . notably, numerous genes in the following categories ‘aba-mediated signaling’ and ‘response to aba stimulus’ were detected, which further confirmed that aba-dependent signaling plays an important role in mediating adaptive responses in both plants.

dehydrins function as candidate genes regulating cold tolerance
the physiochemical responses for plant adaptation to cold stress results mainly from changes in the expression of cor genes. the lea protein functions as an antioxidant and a membrane and protein stabilizer during cold stress  <cit> . the dehydrins, belonging to the class of lea proteins have expression patterns highly correlated with cold-stress tolerance  <cit> . the levels of some of these proteins are controlled by cbf transcription factors  <cit> . in this study, several dehydrin-related genes over-accumulated in dx exclusively and contributed to the enhanced cold tolerance. additionally, lea14-a, cor413pm, cor <dig>  and cor14a showed higher transcriptional abundance in dx than in gn, indicating less celluar membrane oxidative damage thereby enhancing cold tolerance in dx. similar studies in wheat have shown that the expression of wcor <dig> and wcor <dig> was higher for cold-tolerant than cold-sensitive genotypes  <cit> . combined with coexpression results, we speculate that the higher expression of cor genes enables dx to more effectively activate downstream defense reponses and further improve tolerance to cold stress.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a comprehensive description of the transcriptomic responses to cold stress in the leaves of two e. nutans genotypes with different tolerances to cold stress. based on physiochemical and transcriptomic data, a responsive model of cold stress in the two e. nutans could be summarized in fig.  <dig>  the cold signal is first perceived through cold-induced membrane rigidification and transduced further via ca2+ signaling and protein kinases resulting in the activation of downstream tfs. the action of the tfs, trigger a cascade of downstream cor gene transcripts, whose activations further modulates cellular metabolic homeostasis and improved tolerance to cold stress. the stronger transcriptional differentiation during cold stress in dx explains its better cold tolerance compared to gn. the identified fructan biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and dx-specific dehydrin-related genes may provide genetic resources for the improvement of cold-tolerant characters in dx. the proposed model, which is based on transcription expression differences between two e. nutans genotypes, may facilitate future studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying cold stress responses in plants.fig.  <dig> hypothetical model summarizing the events occurring in leaves of dx and gn upon cold stress. red text indicates dx specific and more highly expressed molecular responses. blue and black text indicates gn specific responses and those common to both genotypes respectively
