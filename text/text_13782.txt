BACKGROUND
reliable animal models are critical for reproducing infectious disease in experimental settings. frequently used models for pigs include the conventional specific pathogen free  model, cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived  model, and gnotobiotic model. conventional spf models are not always suitable for highly prevalent pathogens because the presence of maternal antibodies precludes challenge or vaccination of very young pigs. both cdcd and gnotobiotic models require surgery to deliver piglets and sterile compartments in which they are raised. as gnotobiotic pigs are raised entirely in sterile compartments, the duration of experiments is limited because pigs may outgrow the allotted space. further, gnotobiotic pigs fail to produce serum immunoglobulin g and igm antibodies to t-cell dependent and type-2 t-cell independent antigens, whereas pigs colonized by a single strain of escherichia coli produce antibodies  <cit> . accordingly, gnotobiotic pigs differ from conventional pigs immunologically. this raises questions regarding the applicability of gnotobiotic pig experiments to field situations. it was in this context that we optimized a previously published snatch-farrowed porcine colostrum-deprived  pig model  <cit>  to achieve 100% survival. this provided an alternative model for infectious disease research  <cit> . sf-pcd pigs were raised on a bovine-colostrum-based liquid diet before weaning, and a post-weaning diet that was free of porcine byproducts  <cit> .

it is also unknown whether sf-pcd pigs are representative of conventional, farm-raised pigs in terms of their immunological responses. the objective of this research was to compare growth performance, and cellular and humoral immune responses following mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  vaccination between sf-pcd pigs and their farm-raised siblings. our results demonstrate that sf-pcd pigs have superior growth performance, humoral and cell mediated immunity following mhyo vaccination compared to their siblings raised on a commercial farm.

peripheral blood mononuclear cells  isolation
whole blood collected into sodium-heparin on d <dig> and diluted 1: <dig> with phosphate buffered saline  was overlaid on to ficoll-paque plus  and separated by centrifugation at 400 g at 20°c for 30 min. after hypotonic lysis of red blood cells, pbmc were washed once with pbs and once with culture medium  with 10%  fetal bovine serum  and 1%  penicillin-streptomycin . cells were stained with  <dig> % trypan blue  and counted on a hemocytometer.

interferon gamma  elispot assay
multiscreen filter plates  were coated with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-porcine ifnγ monoclonal antibodies , incubated overnight at 4°c, washed three times with pbs and blocked with culture medium at 37°c for 1 h. pbmc  were dispensed into each well and incubated with 10 μg/ml whole cell sonicated mhyo antigen , 5 μg/ml concanavalin a , or media alone for 40 h at 37°c in the presence of 5% co <dig>  each sample was assayed in triplicate. cells were removed and plates washed twice with double distilled water, thrice with pbs with  <dig> % tween  <dig> , then incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated mouse anti-bovine ifnγ mab  for 1 h at room temperature. plates were washed four times with pbst and incubated with  <dig>  ng/ml streptavidin alkaline solution  in pbst with 1% bovine serum albumin  at room temperature for 45 min. plates were washed three times with pbst and twice with pbs. spots were developed by adding sigmafast bcip/nbt  to each well according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the number of spots in each well was counted using an aid elispot reader elrifl <dig> . numbers of mhyo-stimulated ifnγ secreting cells were calculated by subtracting the numbers of spots in media wells from those in mhyo stimulated wells. results were expressed as ifnγ secreting cells per million pbmc.

cytokine detection in supernatants of stimulated pbmc
pbmc  isolated on d <dig> were stimulated with 20 μg/ml mhyo antigen or 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  plus 250 ng/ml ionomycin  . supernatants harvested at 65 h post-stimulation were analyzed for interleukins  1β, il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  and chemokine ligand  <dig>  by multiplexed fluorescent microsphere immunoassay  and ifnγ using an elisa.

fmia was performed as previously described  <cit>  with several modifications. briefly, individual capture antibodies were covalently coupled to magnetic beads . the assay buffer was pbs, 1% bsa and  <dig> % na azide . cell culture medium, diluted in pbs-bn as appropriate, was used as a negative control. a standard curve was constructed using cytokine standards diluted appropriately in cell culture medium and pbs-bn. il <dig> and ccl <dig> were tested in a duplex assay with the supernatants diluted 1: <dig> in pbs-bn. all other cytokines were tested in a four-plex assay with supernatants diluted 1: <dig> in pbs-bn. samples and standards were incubated with magnetic beads in duplicate wells of a 96-well plate for 2 h. all incubations were performed in the dark at room temperature on a plate shaker rotating at 500 rpm. a 96-well plate washer  was used to perform three washes with pbst after each incubation step. secondary antibodies were added to each well before a 90 min incubation. beads in each well were incubated in 50 μl of strepavidin-r-phycoerythrin  for 30 min, washed and suspended in 100 μl pbst. coupled microspheres were read in a bio-plex®  <dig> system  and analyzed with bio-plex manager software version  <dig>  . all mean fluorescence intensity  measurements were background corrected by subtracting the mfi of the negative control from the mfi for the respective analyte in each sample.

ifnγ concentrations in pbmc supernatants were tested using the swine ifnγ antibody pair elisa kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that the color substrate was kpl sureblue reserve tmb microwell substrate . color was developed in the dark until the optical density of the highest concentration standard reached approximately  <dig>  at a wavelength of 650 nm when read on a vmax microplate reader  without addition of stop solution. supernatants were tested at a 1: <dig> dilution.

serum mhyo antibody elisa
serum mhyo antibody levels were determined using the idexx mhyo elisa  at biovet inc. . additional titration was performed to establish end point titres for each sample. briefly, a strong positive serum sample was serially diluted in pbs to determine the highest dilution that gave a positive elisa result; in this case, 1: <dig> that approximately corresponding to the elisa positive cut off . the positive control sample was therefore assigned a titre of  <dig>  an eight dilution standard curve was then established  and unknown samples diluted 1: <dig> were tested side-by-side with the standard curve on each plate. finally, the s/p ratios were analyzed and converted to titres using curve-fitting software for elisa analysis 

serum porcine and bovine igg concentration
serum bovine igg concentrations were determined by radial immunodiffusion  as previously described  <cit> . the porcine igg rid assay was adapted from the bovine assay with had several modifications: the antibody was  <dig> % goat anti-swine igg  antibody  and the standard was purified swine igg . the half life of bovine igg in sf-pcd pigs was calculated as described previously  <cit> .

statistical analyses
body weights , average daily gain  , number of ifnγ secreting pbmc, cytokine concentrations in supernatants, serum mhyo antibody levels, and serum porcine igg concentration  were compared between groups using linear regression built by generalized estimation equations  accounting for clustering of litters. all models used an identity link, gaussian distribution and exchangeable correlation matrix with a robust variance estimator. residuals were assessed for normality and homogeneity, and in cases where assumptions were violated, data was transformed  and re-analyzed. if transformed data failed to satisfy the assumptions of linear regression, a non-parametric mann-whitney’s u test was used to assess group differences. all analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version  <dig>  p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant, except for the cytokine analyses, where p <  <dig>  was chosen in order to minimize the risk of type i error associated with testing multiple cytokines.

RESULTS
there were no significant group differences in body weight or adg before weaning . after weaning, sf-pcd pigs exhibited significantly increased adg  and their final body weight was significantly greater than farm pigs . as a result, the overall adg of sf-pcd pigs was significantly greater than farm pigs .table  <dig>

discussion
this study yielded important results pertaining to the growth performance and immune responses of sf-pcd pigs compared to their conventionally raised siblings. the fact that pre-weaning growth rate of sf-pcd pigs did not differ from farm pigs is noteworthy. sf-pcd pigs were bottle-fed for generally less than 48 h before learning to drink from a liquid feeder from which they were fed four times per day. this frequency of feeding was drastically lower than in conventionally reared pigs, which typically suckle more than  <dig> times per day  <cit> . accordingly, it was a concern whether or not sf-pcd pigs would achieve growth rates similar to commercially raised pigs. not only is this possible, but 100% survival should be expected using the established sf-pcd management protocol  <cit> . being raised in a less competitive environment is one possible explanation why the adg of sf-pcd pigs surpassed that of farm pigs after weaning.

mhyo was chosen as an exemplifier antigen because infection in susceptible pigs results in biologically relevant disease, commercial vaccines and antibody tests are available, and pigs free of mhyo could be found locally. since accurate titration of antibody levels is not possible with the idexx mhyo elisa, an additional titration step was performed to enable more accurate estimation of endpoint titres. cell mediated responses were assessed in several ways including an ifnγ elispot and by measuring ifnγ and il <dig> secreted from pbmc following stimulation with mhyo  antigen and pma/iono. the latter is a potent mitogen that induces receptor-independent signal transduction involving conventional and novel protein kinase c  dependent pathways   <cit> . other cytokines reflecting innate immune responses were also measured in supernatants including: il1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine  <cit> ; il <dig>  involved in neutrophil recruitment  <cit> ; ccl <dig>  involved in monocyte recruitment  <cit> ; il <dig>  a regulatory cytokine  <cit> ; and il <dig>  a traditional th <dig> cytokine whose role is disputed in pigs  <cit> .

there was no evidence to suggest that sf-pcd pigs were immunosuppressed. in fact, sf-pcd pigs had significantly more ifnγ secreting pbmc after mhyo antigen stimulation and increased mhyo antibody titers than farm pigs, suggesting they had enhanced cellular and humoral responses. although ifnγ levels in supernatants of mhyo and pma/iono stimulated pbmc did not differ between groups, several other cytokines reflecting innate , regulatory  and th <dig>  responses were increased in sf-pcd. although the reasons are not fully understood, group differences in the intestinal microbiota are a possible contributor. it is likely the intestinal microbial community structures of the two experimental groups differed as a result of differences in their respective environments and pre-weaning diets. evidence in humans indicates that the neonatal intestinal microbial community regulates systemic immunity  <cit> . moreover, pigs raised in environments with different levels of hygiene and intestinal microbial compositions exhibited different mucosal immunity characteristics  <cit> . the results of this experiment suggest that environmental factors may have affected the systemic immune response. unfortunately, assessing differences in the intestinal microbiota was beyond the scope of this study.

higher postweaning stress also may have contributed to group differences in postweaning immune responses. it is well known that pigs experience considerable stress shortly after weaning, demonstrated by a delayed weight gain and an increased serum cortisol concentration  <cit> . it is possible that sf-pcd pigs experienced less postweaning stress because pen density and feeding competition was lower than that experienced by farm pigs. it should be noted, however, that increased cortisol levels in conventionally weaned farm pig return to normal within  <dig> d  <cit> . the timing of vaccinations in this experiment, on d <dig> and d <dig>  were not in this postweaning stress period. thus, if postweaning stress contributed to the findings in this study, the postweaning stress period may have extended beyond  <dig> d postweaning in the farm pigs.

the composition of the milk and colostrum diets may have also contributed to the observed differences in the immune response of sf-pcd and farm pigs. colostrum is rich in immunoglobulin, but mature bovine and porcine milk contains much lower immunoglobulin concentration  <cit> . in addition to immunoglobulin, a large number of bioactive substances have been identified in bovine colostrum, such as insulin-like growth factors -i and –ii, epidermal growth factor , lactoferrin, and others  <cit> . by consuming bovine colostrum throughout the entire preweaning phase, sf-pcd pigs consumed more of these bioactive factors than farm pigs. although bovine and porcine colostrum contain similar levels of igf-i, the mature milk of both species has about 10-fold less. thus, sf-pcd pigs would have consumed more igf-i throughout the suckling phase than farm pigs that may have contributed to differences in the immune responses of sf-pcd relative to farm pigs.

finally, it is not known if the group differences in the magnitude of the immune response observed in this study are biologically relevant. although sf-pcd pigs had significantly increased ifnγ response and mhyo antibody titers, it was recently reported that increased serum mhyo antibody titers but decreased ifnγ production by pbmc were associated with superior protection against mhyo challenge  <cit> . this research has therefore generated several unanswered questions pertaining to variation in immune responses, which are worthy of pursuit.

CONCLUSIONS
under the conditions of this experiment sf-pcd pigs demonstrated superior growth performance and greater humoral and cell mediated immunity following mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccination. whether or not this would result in greater resistance to infection or less severe disease following exposure to mhyo is unknown. sf-pcd pigs, however, are clearly not immunosuppressed and thus are suitable for porcine infectious disease research and could be used to address this and other questions relevant to the swine industry.
