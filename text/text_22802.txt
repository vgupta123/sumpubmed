BACKGROUND
the field of auditory biology has made tremendous strides over recent decades, but molecular characterization has been greatly hampered by the paucity of available neuroepithelia and the difficulty in accessing the inner ear. in mammals, the sensory tissue is deeply buried in the skull and presents few and small discrete sensory regions.

the lateral line, a sensory organ specific to fish and amphibians, offers an excellent alternative "model organ" for the inner ear, because of its strong similarities and common developmental program  <cit> . the superficially and stereotypically distributed sensory patches along the side of the fish are called neuromasts  <cit> . like neuroepithelia in the inner ear, neuromasts are composed of two main cell types, hair cells and supporting cells. hair cells are mechanoreceptors, which are transducing the mechanical deflection of their apical cilia into electrical signals that are relayed to the cns  <cit> . the lateral line is directly exposed to its aqueous surroundings and the hair cells are triggered by water movements, influencing swimming behaviors  <cit> . the supporting cells are still a poorly defined and described group of cells. they comprise at least two different cell types, which have been distinguished mainly on morphological criteria, called the supporting  cells and the mantle cells  <cit> . we will refer to them in aggregate as accessory cells. they have a structural and cohesive role in neuroepithelia, but more remarkably, in non-mammalian vertebrates, they comprise the progenitor pool that replaces damaged or destroyed hair cells throughout the life of the animal  <cit> . the regenerative property of supporting cells is lost in mammals after birth, therefore rendering the absence/damage of hair cells irreversible. because zebrafish are able to regenerate lost hair cells in both the ear and in the lateral line, the neuromasts offers an attractive in vivo system to study the development and the regeneration of the sensory neuroepithelia  <cit> .

whereas hair cells have been extensively studied and characterized, offering a large panel of vital stains and molecular markers, very few markers are available for accessory cells resulting in a challenge for the field. we identified a "gene-trap" transgenic line that expresses gfp in accessory cells of the lateral line and of the olfactory sensory epithelium. we show that the gene-trap construct landed in a gene we have characterized as being the homolog of tankyrase  <dig> binding protein  <dig> , a gene interacting with tankyrase  <dig>  which has several putative functions in cells including telomere elongation  <cit> . additionally, we used the transgenic line as a tool for enriching accessory cells and defining their transcriptional signature. first, we fac sorted homogenates of tg larvae to isolate gfp positive cells. we extracted their rna and hybridized it against reference rna made from non-fluorescent cells. genes that determined as up-regulated or enriched were specific to accessory cells and essentially provide a transcriptional signature. we present here the transcriptional profiling, providing a new set of markers specific for accessory cells of the lateral line. this tool will be valuable for studying regeneration in the lateral line in particular and regeneration of neuroepithelia in general.

RESULTS
the transgenic line tg expressed egfp specifically in the accessory cells of the lateral line and of the olfactory epithelium
we focused our attention on one particular transgenic line found in a gene trap effort, which had a highly restricted expression pattern prominent in the supporting cells and mantle cells. starting at  <dig> days post fertilization  the gfp was limited to two obvious developing sensory organs, the lateral line  and the olfactory epithelium . the signal from the yolk sac and extension was due to auto-fluorescence. the gfp expression was persistent in adult animals . when taking a closer look at one of the functional units of the lateral line, called the neuromast,  we noticed that the whole sensory structure, with the exception of the centrally located cells , was expressing gfp. neuromasts have been well characterized and described previously as centrally located mechanoreceptors, also called hair cells surrounded by supporting cells  <cit> .

to confirm the identity of the gfp negative cells, we crossed the transgenic tg line into another previously published transgenic line, tg, which expresses the tomato reporter gene in hair cells  <cit>  . no overlapping egfp and tomato expression was found, as illustrated in figure 1d, egfp  in accessory cells and tomato  in hair cells. because some transgenic lines do not faithfully recapitulate all of the normal gene expression, to further confirm the identity of the gfp positive cells we counterstained fixed  <dig> dpf larvae with two antibodies, an anti-gfp  and one to a well-documented hair cell specific marker: myosin vi   <cit> . as seen in two different examples of tg transgenic neuromasts , the centrally located hair cells were gfp negative and myosin vi positive. all accessory cells were expressing gfp. in the apical part of the neuromast, supporting cells were forming a "honey comb like" structure  through which hair cells were sending their hair bundles . each hair cell appeared as being isolated from its neighbor by a thin cytoplasmic furrow formed by the surrounding supporting cells  and dorsal  views of a neuromast). hair cells were visible in dark red with light red nuclei and accessory cells in light green with dark green nuclei). to further assess that gfp was absent from hair cells, we performed cryosections followed by antibody staining in transgenic larvae. the gfp staining was completely excluded form hair cells and restricted to accessory cells . the more peripheral mantle cells, which have been described previously  <cit>  were also stained . we therefore concluded, that the tg was the specific to accessory cells  in the lateral line.

the tol <dig> transposon construct traps the putative zebrafish homolog of tnks1bp1
the accessory cells have been described as comprising a pool of cells that can give rise to new hair cells after hair cell ablation  <cit> . in order to further characterize the accessory cells, we identified the gene trapped by the tol <dig> construct in the tg transgenic line. we mapped the genomic region adjacent to the transposon insertion site, using methods described previously  <cit> . we found the insertion in the first intron of a predicted gene that mapped to chromosome  <dig> . we cloned the entire gene with its 5' and 3' utr. the cdna was  <dig> nucleotides  long comprised of  <dig> exons . the first exon was short  and untranslated. in the second exon  we found the translational start . the third exon was remarkably long , followed by  <dig> short ones  . the longest putative encoded protein would be  <dig> amino acids . the complete sequence has been submitted to genbank .

next, we searched the sequence databases for homologies and other available information. no conserved domains were found throughout the putative coding region. when performing blast on the ncbi website http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ <cit> , we found a stretch of ~ 65aa encoded by part of exon  <dig>  the whole exon  <dig> and part of exon  <dig> in the 3' end of the gene that showed significant identity with a region of the product of the tankyrase <dig> binding protein . the degree of identity of this conserved stretch was varying from  <dig> to 50% in  <dig> different species, ranging from tilapia to human . this gene was of particular interest as the tankyrase <dig> gene has been implicated in regulating the length of telomeres  <cit> , a function that would be highly relevant to stem cell populations. in addition another stretch of ~40aa in the n-terminus of the putative protein was showing a significant identity  with the predicted tnks1bp <dig> protein in ailuropoda melanoleuca . nearly all of the tnks1bp <dig> gene products in different species have been computer predicted only, and the lack of identity with the rest of the sequence does not exclude the possibility that this is not a precise homolog of tnks1bp <dig>  but potentially a gene related to the tkns1bp <dig> gene with an expression pattern restricted to accessory cells of the lateral line. therefore, we concluded that the trapped gene encodes a putative homolog of the tnks1bp <dig> gene.

to confirm that the insertion was indeed trapping the tnks1bp <dig> gene, we performed rt-pcr targeting a transcript that was a fusion product of tnks1bp <dig> and egfp. we found this product in abundance in the transgenic animals. upon sequencing the transcript, we found it was the result of the fusion of the 5'utr of tnks1bp <dig>  with the gfp sequence followed by a polya tail . this was the expected result considering the construct used in the gene trap approach . this confirmed that the construct had indeed landed in the tnks1bp <dig> gene and that the gfp expression was faithfully reporting the expression of the endogenous tnks1bp <dig> gene.

we performed whole mount in situ hybridization  in embryos of various stages using a probe designed against several regions of the tnks1bp <dig> gene. the wish reproduced the gfp expression in all the neuromasts  and in the olfactory epithelium . the staining was present in all of the accessory cells . taken together, these results clearly showed that the tnks1bp <dig> gene was expressed in all accessory cells of the lateral line and the olfactory epithelium as reported by the gfp insertion in the tg transgenic line and in the wish against tnks1bp <dig>  this confirmed that tnks1bp <dig> is a highly specific accessory cell marker.

we checked for phenotypic differences in heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the transgene. homozygotes were relatively easy to distinguish as the expression of gfp was noticeably stronger. the lateral line developed normally in all the larvae at all stages that we checked . next, we looked if the regeneration of hair cells was affected in either heterozygous or homozygous carriers using an assay described previously  <cit> . again we did not see a significant phenotype . to be able to conclude on the absence of phenotype, we needed to determine if the insertion of the gene-trap was indeed completely disrupting the tnks1bp <dig> gene.

in order to assess the presence of various possible splicing products in wild-type and homozygous larva, we designed two different sets of primers for qrt-pcr on rna extracted from wild-type  and homozygous  larvae. primer set one  amplified from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> identifying the wild-type message. primer set two  amplified the fusion of exon  <dig> with the egfp trap exon identifying "trapped" message. as expected the product from set  <dig> was absent in wild-type larva. the other primer showed no measurable significant difference between wild-type and homozygous transgenics . therefore, we concluded that in tg homozygote carriers, the gene trap was significantly spliced around, allowing for both the production of the wild-type and the gene-trap transcripts. thus, the expression of the tnks1bp <dig> gene was not significantly disrupted in homozygous carriers.

next, we used a knockdown approach where we injected two different morpholinos against the atg of the tnks1bp <dig> gene in wild-type and tg homozygote embryos. a mismatch control was injected in parallel. none of the morphants exhibited significant phenotypes . we concluded that  the significant functions of the tnks1bp <dig> gene might come in play only after the time window during which the morpholinos have a reliable effect , or the gene is not essential for the functions we tested. this was compatible with a late onset of the tnks1bp <dig> gene expression around  <dig> dpf, as reported by the transgenic line. alternative approaches will have to be pursued to further assess the role of the tnks1bp <dig> gene.

defining the transcriptome of accessory cells of the lateral line and the olfactory sensory epithelium
only a handful of specific markers are available for accessory cells in the neuromast of the lateral line. to address this need and in order to better characterize those cells at the molecular level, we decided to undertake a genomic approach using the tg line. in a  <dig> dpf larva, we roughly estimated the number of accessory cells to be in the range of 1000- <dig> cells. the larva has ~ <dig> neuromasts in its lateral line with ≈ <dig> accessory cells/neuromast + ≈  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/olfactory epithelium =  <dig>  this represented a small number of cells compared to the total number of cells in a larva at this stage, which in our estimation was in the range of several billion. as we wanted to address the composition of transcripts in the accessory cells specifically , we needed to isolate them from the remaining larval cells. the method we used is schematized in figure 4a. briefly, we collected  <dig> dpf tg  larvae and dissociated them to form a cell suspension. in the next step, we passed the cell suspension through fluorescence activated cell sorting  to separate gfp positive  cells and collected this fraction. the settings for the sorting were carefully determined empirically and exactly reproduced in each subsequent experiment. an illustration of those settings is shown . the left plot  was used to sort cells according to cell size  vs. granularity . the right plot discriminated cells, according to the gfp fluorescence intensity of cells  vs. phycoerythrin . gates were demarcated to sort gfp negative  and gfp positive  cells. both of those fractions were visually assessed under the microscope for the absence or presence of gfp respectively . the gfp + fraction, highly enriched in gfp positive cells, now theoretically contained mostly accessory cells.

next, we extracted the rna from the gfp + cells population using traditional phenol chloroform extraction methods. in parallel we prepared control rna, which we extracted from whole wild-type larvae at different development stages. we synthesized and labeled cdna probes from both rna populations, which were then co-hybridized custom printed microarrays  <cit> . each chip represented ≈ <dig>  spots, which corresponded to roughly  <dig>  genes. mrna of genes that were exclusively or overwhelmingly present in the accessory cell population would appear as up-regulated and we referred to these transcripts hereafter as, enriched.

analysis of the microarray data
the microarray experiment was performed with multiple biological replicates  and technical replicates . after normalization , the results were analyzed in parallel using two separate microarray analysis resources, genesifter http://www.geospiza.com/products/analysisedition.shtml and madb http://madb.nci.nih.gov/ generating respectively, gene lists a  and b . in both cases, the results were tested for statistical significance, using a classic two-tailed t-test and we set a threshold of at least a two-fold up-regulation for genes to be considered enriched. in gene list a, a correction of benjamin and hochberg was applied. in both lists, the results were log <dig> transformed. we found more than  <dig>  genes which were enriched by at least two-fold in the gfp + fraction with a p <  <dig> . in gene list b,  <dig>  genes were removed for having an insufficient number of values and we found more than  <dig>  genes which were enriched by at least two fold in the gfp + fraction with a p <  <dig> . next we ranked the lists from the highly enriched genes down and manually compared the two lists. to simplify, we concentrated on the  <dig> top ranked genes, which were genes that were enriched by at least four-fold. we found a remarkable correspondence between the two lists, giving us great confidence about the strength of the analyses. as gene list b was more stringent and more complete regarding gene annotation, we decided to restrict all further analysis to this list. both full lists a and b can be found as additional files  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

strikingly, we found in both lists that the top enriched genes were all pancreatic enzymes, which was unexpected. this might be caused by the intrinsic high background fluorescence present in the  <dig> dpf larvae in the gut, which could contaminate the gfp + cells population during the fac sorting and would biased all subsequent steps. alternatively, there are a small number of bona fide gfp + cells in the pancreas  that are being enriched. in either case, a small number of cells would show very strong enrichment for pancreatic enzymes since there would be essentially no expression of genes such as elastase in other tissues.

validation of the microarray data
using published expression data, we validated the gene list by looking for genes already known as been expressed in accessory cells. our main resource was the zebrafish model organism database . using "lateral line" as anatomical search term, the database showed  <dig> expressed genes. however, most of those genes were expressed mostly in the hair cells. when restricting the search to accessory cells  only  <dig> genes were listed. next when available, we checked the whole mount in situ hybridization  images for each gene, first to confirm the expression pattern and second to see when and where in the embryo this gene was expressed during development. one limitation of our approach was that any gene which was also expressed in other tissues or organs would be masked in our arrays, as we were subtracting the accessory cell's expression against the whole larvae. a good illustration of this was the two following genes, claudinb  and the epithelial cell adhesion molecule . both of those genes were well-described markers for the lateral line  <cit> . cldnb, from early on in development is expressed strongly in the lateral line  which is one of the only tissues it is expressed in, with the exception of an early signal in the brain and the nephritic ducts. in our list this gene is highly enriched . in contrast, epcam started out as a fairly ubiquitously expressed gene that gets progressively restricted to the lateral line, the pharyngeal pouch and the pharyngeal endoderm. this gene was also enriched, but more modestly .

in addition we looked at genes, which have been reported in the literature as being expressed in supporting cells of sensory neuroepithelia in various animal models. however, most of those genes were expressed in the supporting cells and also in a number of other structures at various stages. for example, this was the case for the genes of the notch family   <cit> , which were not found as significant enriched in our data set , as those genes were expressed in the accessory cells, but also in a number of other tissues at all stages. another well-documented marker of accessory cells in neuromasts, keratin  <dig>   <cit>  which is specific to the lateral line from early on with the exception of the pharyngeal arches and the gut, was substantially increased in our list . therefore, we concluded that our approach was valid, as most of the known markers of accessory cells of the lateral line behaved as expected in our data set.

new markers validated by wish and qrt-pcr
our main interest was to find new markers for the accessory cells of the lateral line. based on our primary analysis of the microarray data, we reasoned that genes enriched more than fourfold would be specifically expressed in accessory cells of the olfactory epithelium and/or the lateral line . therefore, we randomly chose  <dig> genes , which had not been previously described as expressed in the lateral line . we assessed them in a qualitative  and a quantitative approach .

column1: the numbers  attributed from  <dig> to  <dig> to the randomly chosen genes. column 2: the gene identifier, as found in ncbi databases. columns  <dig> and 4: the enrichment fold and the p-value respectively, as determined with the madb analysis of the microarray results. column 5: the gene's name as described in the ncbi databases. column 6: ranking of the gene in list b determined in the madb analysis of the microarray results.

first, we made antisense probes for wish. six out of the fifteen probes reliably gave us a strong and specific staining in the neuromasts . for the rest of the probes we obtained inconclusive results, possibly because of their poor quality, as we sometimes had only very small sequences to choose from . accessory cells were strongly and exclusively labeled in four out of those six genes/ests . this was visualized in a ring like staining absent from the center of the neuromast . gene  <dig>  was documented as a transcribed locus, weakly similar to np_ <dig>  immediate early response <dig> with an enrichment =  <dig>  fold  . gene  <dig>  was described as atp1a1a. <dig> atpase, na +/k + transporting, alpha 1a. <dig> polypeptide, with an enrichment =  <dig>  fold  . gene  <dig>  is heme binding protein  <dig>  and had an enrichment =  <dig>   . gene  <dig>  with an enrichment =  <dig> ,   was described as a member of the membrane-spanning 4-domains, subfamily a, member 17a. <dig> . finally, the two remaining genes  <dig> and  <dig> were staining more strongly the hair cells in addition to the accessory cells. gene  <dig>  was also poorly described  and had an enrichment =  <dig>  fold  . gene # <dig>  was documented as similar to ferritin heavy chain , also called, cell proliferation-inducing gene  <dig> protein, enrichment =  <dig>  fold  . noticeably, all of the above genes had an expression pattern restricted to neuromasts. therefore, we concluded that our approach was an effective way of uncovering new markers for the population of interest, namely the accessory cells of the lateral line.

next we designed primer sets for performing qrt-pcr on the same  <dig> genes  and on the tnks1bp <dig> gene. we obtained results for 7/ <dig>  we saw an increased expression ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> fold  in the gfp + cells. genes that were showing both staining in wish and gave results in the qrt-pcr were depicted in yellow. genes with results only in qpcr were shown in blue and the tnks1bp <dig> gene, which was increased by  <dig> fold, was depicted in green. in conclusion, we confirmed for  <dig> tested genes  the enriched expression that was seen by wish and an additional  <dig> genes had enriched expression by qrt-pcr. taken all together, we assessed  <dig> randomly chosen genes with quantitative and qualitative methods and found a specific expression in the neuromast and/or an increased expression in the gfp + cell population in  <dig> of them. thus, assessing randomly chosen genes with quantitative and qualitative methods, we confirmed the validity of the combinatory approach of facs and microarrays to establish the transcriptome of accessory cells in zebrafish.

discussion
accessory cells of the lateral line organ in zebrafish are known to comprise a subpopulation of progenitor cells, but are still very poorly characterized at the molecular level. we have established and characterized a new transgenic line tg , which has a restrictive and specific gfp expression in this small population of cells in zebrafish larvae. we have cloned a putative homolog of tnks1bp <dig> with a highly specific expression restricted to accessory cells. we will further pursue the functional analysis of this gene in the accessory cells of the lateral line.

we have then utilized this transgenic line in a combined approach of facsorting and microarray analysis in order to gain molecular insight into the accessory cells of the neuromasts. the intrinsic limitations of our assay were twofold. as we were subtracting rna from gfp + cells against rna from whole larvae, we could only find enrichment in genes, which are not expressed, or expressed at very low levels, in other tissues of the larvae. a second limitation of our approach was the fact that in addition to gfp expression in the lateral line, it was also expressed in the olfactory epithelium. thus, as a first approach, it is difficult to distinguish genes specific to either neuroepithelia. only wish done gene by gene will distinguish between the two organs. however, this will be useful information, as it will allow establishing parallels and differences between two regenerating tissues in the fish. furthermore, the olfactory epithelium is well known for its regenerative capacity into adulthood, even in mammals. this will allow further comparison with non-regenerating sensory epithelia in higher vertebrates, like the inner ear.

we found the surprising result that the top enriched genes were all pancreatic enzymes. while there was no obvious expression in the pancreas, this possibility is not ruled out, nor is the possibility of contamination in our enrichment because of autofluorescence.

nevertheless, we could convincingly show enrichment in genes specific to accessory cells of the lateral line. first as expected, we found enrichment in genes that were known to be expressed by accessory cells. second, we found and described new markers, which were specific to neuromasts and in most cases to accessory cells. not all genes that we picked for testing by wish or qpcr gave us results. one plausible explanation is that many of the oligomers chosen for the "in house" microarrays correspond only to short ests, which often offer only very little sequence to design good antisense probes or primers for q-pcr. another possibility is that expression levels are too low to be robustly detected by wish. this brings up a clear limitation of the microarray approach in general, as you only ever interrogate the limited pool of genes that have been preselected while building the array.

CONCLUSIONS
we present a new transgenic egfp zebrafish gene trap, which landed in a putative homolog of the tnks1bp <dig> gene. the trapped expression is a highly-specific and restricted to cells, which comprised progenitor cells in the lateral line and olfactory epithelium. the putative function of this gene in maintenance of telomere length  <cit>  would fit perfectly with the characteristics of such a cell population, but remains to be investigated. the transcriptional signature presented here will facilitate other studies aiming at the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing the regenerative potential of sensory epithelia.
