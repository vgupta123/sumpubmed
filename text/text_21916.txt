BACKGROUND
the development and evaluation of new energy functions is critical to the accurate modeling of the properties of biological macromolecules  <cit> . a potential that can discriminate between the native and miss-folded structures is crucial for any protein structure prediction protocol to be fully successful. toward this end, two different types of potential functions are currently in use  <cit> . the first class of potentials, the so-called physical-based potential, is based on the fundamental analysis of forces between atoms  <cit> . the second class, the so-called knowledge-based potentials, extracts parameters from experimentally solved protein structures  <cit> . the advantage of the first class of potentials is that, in principle, they can be derived from the laws of physics. the disadvantage is that the calculation of free energy is very difficult because the computation should include an atomic description of the protein and the surrounding solvent. currently this type of computation is generally too expensive for protein folding  <cit> . while, with today's computer resources, knowledge-based potentials can be quite successful at fold recognition  <cit>  and ab initio structure prediction  <cit> .

much can be learned through statistical analysis of interacting groups in experimentally determined protein structures. such analysis provides the basis for knowledge-based potentials of mean force. generally, knowledge-based potentials have used a simple one- or two-point-per-residue representation, which results in the potentials at the residue level. each residue in a protein sequence is represented by one or two points in three-dimensional space. these points are usually located at the coordinates of each residue's cα atoms, cβ atoms or at the coordinates of the center of each side chain. discrimination is based on each residue's preference to be buried or exposed  <cit> , its preference for a particular secondary structure conformation  <cit> , its preference for the contact number with other residues  <cit>  and its preference to be in contact at a particular distance and sequence separation from other residues  <cit> . however, to capture the finer details of atom-atom interactions in proteins, a more detailed description is necessary. each heavy atom either at the main-chain or side-chain is represented by an independent point, which results in the knowledge-based potentials at the atom level. a number of potentials at the atom level have been designed  <cit> . because of its atom level definition, the knowledge-based potentials at the atom level can provide better discriminatory power than obtained at the residue level  <cit> .

although the knowledge-based mean force potentials at the residue level are based on the coarse description of protein structures, they are easier to be used in fold recognition or threading than those at the atom level  <cit> . many fold-recognition methods use knowledge-based potentials to interpret probabilistic scoring functions. sequence-template alignments are evaluated in terms of a scoring function and the score of the alignment is interpreted as a "free energy" of the sequence in the conformation imposed by the alignment  <cit> . this interpretation indicates that the most probable sequence-structure alignment is the one with the lowest "free energy". the 123d method  <cit>  applies the pairwise sequence alignment and contact capacity potentials to fast protein fold recognition. the spark method  <cit>  combines the sequence-profile alignment and single-body knowledge-based energy score for fold recognition. the genthreader method  <cit>  apply neural network to evaluate the compatibility of the sequence and the template with pairwise potentials and solvation potentials as input. in addition to the fold recognition or threading, knowledge-based potentials are widely used in selection of native structures of proteins  <cit> , estimation of protein stability  <cit> , ab initio protein structure prediction  <cit> , etc.

the aim of this paper is to develop a class of novel knowledge-based mean force potentials at the profile level, which uses the evolutionary information of the profile  <cit> . such potentials can provide better discriminatory power than those at the residue level and can be incorporated into the process of fold recognition or threading. multiple sequences alignments of protein sequences may contain much information regarding evolutionary processes. this information can be detected by analyzing the output of psi-blast  <cit> . the frequency profiles are directly calculated from the multiple sequence alignments and then converted into binary profiles with a cut-off probability for usage. such binary profiles make up of a new alphabet for protein sequences. similar to the knowledge-based potentials at the residue level, a class of novel potentials at the profile level is introduced. we developed four types of profile-level statistical potentials including distance-dependent, contact, Φ/Ψ dihedral angle and accessible surface statistical potentials. these potentials are first evaluated by the fold assessment between the correct and incorrect models generated by comparative modeling. they are then used to recognize the native structure from the well-constructed decoy set. experimental results show that all the knowledge-base mean force potentials at the profile level outperform those at the residue level.

RESULTS
fold assessment on test models
to evaluate the performance of the statistical potentials at the profile level and those at the residue level, the first experiment is made to discriminate between the good models and the bad models on our structure models. the parameters of various potentials are selected as the optimal values as suggested by others  <cit> . for the distance-dependent potentials, the interaction center is set as cβ atom. the distance range is  <dig> Å with distance interval of  <dig> Å. the sequence separation k varies from  <dig> to  <dig>  the rare situation with sequence separation larger than  <dig> is included in the last bin. for the contact potential, the number of contact bin is set to  <dig>  in the rare occasions of more than  <dig> contacts, the statistics are included in the bin for  <dig> contacts. all the contacts with sequence separation larger than  <dig> are computed. for the Φ/Ψ dihedral angle potential, each of the torsion is divided into  <dig> bins. there are total  <dig> bins. for the accessible surface potential, the interaction center is set as cβ atom. the distance range  is set as  <dig> Å. the burial range varies from  <dig> to  <dig> atoms with burial interval of  <dig> atoms. the atoms within the same residues are not considered for statistics.

the statistics of propensity of various potentials are performed on the pdb <dig> dataset. these potentials are then calculated to discriminate between good models and bad models for each of the sequence. the fraction of correctly predicted case , the success rates, the z-scores and the roc curve are employed to evaluate the performance. the results are shown in table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  in the roc curve, a lower plot corresponds to a better discriminative power.

as can be seen, all the knowledge-based mean force potentials at the profile level outperform those at the residue level. the improvements of various potentials at the profile level are different from those at the residue level. significant improvements of cp are obtained for the distance-dependent and accessible surface potentials . the contact and Φ/Ψ dihedral angle potential only get a slight improvement of cp .

tested on baker's set
the baker's set  <cit>  is a well-constructed decoy set that is obtained by large-scale comparative modeling. the dataset consists of  <dig> single domain proteins and each protein is attached with about  <dig> decoy structures. the decoy structures are classified into good models and bad models by the same criterion as used by our structure models. models with >30% structural overlap with the experimentally determined structures are grouped into good models. models with <15% structural overlap with the experimentally determined structures are grouped into bad models. the fold assessment results are shown in table  <dig> 

overall the knowledge-based mean force potentials at the profile level still outperform those at the residue level. significant improvements are obtained for the distance-dependent and accessible surface potentials. the cp scores of all potentials on the baker's set are lower than those on our structure models. there are two reasons for this phenomenon. the first one is that the baker's set is inherently difficult to discriminate. such dataset is carefully constructed and satisfies the so-called four criteria listed in their introduction  <cit> . the second one is that the number and distribution of good models and bad models in this dataset are different from those in our dataset. in baker's dataset, the total models for a sequence are very large  and the distribution between the number of good models and that of bad models is different. for example, the sequence 1ptq has only  <dig> good models and  <dig> bad models, while the sequence 1res has  <dig> good models and only one bad model. in our dataset, each sequence has about thirty models and the good models and bad models are equally distributed .

prostar decoy set evaluation
all the decoy sets from prostar website  <cit>  are well-constructed and widely used for evaluation of all kinds of newly developed potentials  <cit> . three subsets including misfold  <cit> , ifu  <cit>  and pdberr  <cit>  are selected for testing. the ifu dataset contains a set of models for small peptides rather than the whole protein chains. since direct generation of profiles for such small peptides may not be reliable, we first generate the profiles of the whole protein chains and extract the corresponding profiles for such small peptides. there are two proteins  that are not found in the pdb database  <cit> , the corresponding decoy models are removed . the results of decoy set evaluation are given in table  <dig>  when the energy z-scores of the native structure are lower than those of the decoy models, a correct discrimination is obtained.

all the knowledge-based mean force potentials get good results on the misfold and pdberr dataset and acceptable results on the ifu dataset. the ifu dataset is more challenging than the other two dataset, because this dataset contains the decoy models for small peptides and fold assessment by statistical potentials is most difficult for the very small models  <cit> . small models are difficult to assess because of the relatively small number of pairwise interactions by which they are judged, not because of their incompleteness. overall, the potentials at the profile level still outperform those at the residue level on the ifu dataset. the best discrimination is achieved by the distance-dependent potentials at the profile level, which correctly recognize  <dig> out of  <dig> decoy pairs, corresponding to accuracy of 85%. such results outperform other atom-level potentials such as the residue specific all-atom probability discriminatory function   <cit>  and the atomically detailed potentials of t32s <dig>  <cit> . these two potentials get 100% accuracy on the misfold dataset as done by the profile-level distance-dependent potentials. they correctly identified 73% and 80% of the decoy pair on the ifu dataset respectively  <cit> , while the profile-level distance-dependent potentials correctly identified 85% of the decoy pair on the same dataset.

multiple decoy sets evaluation
to give an un-bias result and fair comparison with other potentials, we use five out of seven multiple decoy sets as used by zhang et al.  <cit> . they include the 4state_reduce set  <cit> , lmds set  <cit> , fisa set  <cit> , fisa_casp <dig> set  <cit> , lattice_ssfit set  <cit> . totally, there are  <dig> multiple decoy sets available . no decoy structures in the original decoy sets are omitted in this study. the diverse and comprehensive decoy sets ensure the fair evaluation of the overall quality of the potentials. we also compare our potentials with dfire-scm  <cit> , which is one of the most recent residue-level potentials. the results are evaluated in terms of success rates in native discriminations and z-score for different decoy sets. the performances of different potentials are shown in table  <dig> 

as can be seen, all the profile-level statistical potentials outperform those at the residue-level. overall, the success rates of profile-level potentials are better than those of residue-level potentials. even with the same success rates on some datasets, the z-scores of profile-level potentials are higher than those of residue-level. the distance-dependent knowledge-based potential  <cit>  in this paper is the prosaii potential as mentioned by zhang et al.  <cit> , which is inferior to dfire-scm according to zhang et al.  <cit> . the distance-dependent potential at the profile level is comparable with the dfire-scm potential. the former correctly recognizes  <dig> out of  <dig> decoy structures, while the latter correctly recognizes  <dig> out of  <dig> decoy structures. the contact, Φ/Ψ dihedral angle and accessible surface statistical potentials are single-body residue-level statistical potentials, which are based on the coarse descriptions of protein structures. such potentials get lower performance in comparison with other two-body atom-level statistical potentials in many experiments  <cit> . these simple potentials at the profile-level still outperform those at the residue-level according to our experiments. these results suggest that the binary profiles are smarter representations of protein structures than residues.

discussion
the probability threshold has not significant influence on the profile-level statistical potentials
the frequency profiles are calculated from the multiple sequence alignments outputted by psi-blast  <cit>  and converted into binary profiles by a probability threshold ph. the total number of binary profiles is dependent on the size of the database and the value of probability threshold ph. since each combination of the twenty amino acids corresponds to a binary profile and vice versa, the total number of binary profiles is 2^ <dig>  in fact, only a small fraction of binary profiles appear. these binary profiles substitute for novel alphabets of protein sequences to develop a class of novel profile-level statistical potentials. since the probability threshold ph is a parameter, it needs to be optimized. the results are shown in table  <dig>  we surprisingly found that the probability threshold ph has not significant influence on all the profile-level statistical potentials. when the probability threshold is larger than  <dig> , the number of binary profiles is very small and the discriminative power of all the profile-level statistical potentials drops quickly. since the decrease in the number of residue types reduces the discriminative ability of the potentials  <cit> , we can draw a similar conclusion that an increase in the number of alphabets of protein sequences can improve the discriminative power of the potentials. this study provides a method for increasing the number of alphabets of protein sequences, that is, the profile method.

the energy of profile-level statistical potentials correlates well with rmsd
another measure of the potential quality and its global attraction is the dependence of the energy on the proximity to the native structure. the proper coordinate to measure proximity to the native structure is not obvious. however in numerous cases the rmsd is used  <cit> . in fig.  <dig>  the scatter plot of the energy as a function of the decoy cα rmsd value is plotted. since the potentials of different native structures are not comparable, only one of the sequence  and its models are plotted. as can be seen, the energy of profile-level statistical potentials correlates well with the cα rmsd up to quite large rmsds. this suggests that the profile-level potentials can be useful in simulations that attempt to get closer to the native conformation starting from a distant conformation.

using evolutionary information can improve the discriminative power of knowledge-based mean force potentials
in the profile-level statistical potentials, the protein sequence is represented as a sequence of frequency profile rather than an amino acid sequence. the frequency profile contains the evolutionary information of protein sequences, which is the probabilities of the amino acids occurred in the specific position of the protein sequences. such profiles are used to produce more discriminative potentials. as the best of our knowledge, this is the first usage of evolutionary information for developing more advanced potentials. the potentials at the profile level are prior to those at residue level according to the experiments. so evolutionary information can improve the discriminative power of knowledge-based mean force potentials. this conclusion is not surprising, since the evolutionary information is widely used in lots of biological problems such as the protein secondary structure prediction  <cit> , remote homologue detection  <cit> , sub-cellular localization  <cit> , domain boundary prediction  <cit> , fold recognition  <cit> , protein-protein interaction prediction  <cit> , function annotation  <cit> , etc.

profile-level statistical potentials can improve the performance of threading
fold recognition or threading is another application of knowledge-based mean force potentials. many methods combine the residue-level statistical potentials with sequence alignments for threading, such as the sparks method  <cit> . we have implemented a threading method that combines the profile-level statistical potentials with profile-profile alignments. such profile-level threading method  is compared with the threading method that uses the residue-level statistical potentials .

since the multi-body statistical potentials are hard to be used for threading, a combined potentials has been presented, which integrate the three single-body potentials of this study, that is, the Φ/Ψ dihedral angle, accessible surface and contact statistical potentials:

e = et + wf ef + wc ec     

where et, ef, ec is the Φ/Ψ dihedral angle, accessible surface and contact statistical potentials respectively, i is amino acid for residue-level potentials and profile for profile-level potentials at the i-th position of the sequence, wf and wc are the weights of accessible surface and contact statistical potentials. the total potential for a protein is then obtained by summing the potentials of each of the amino acid or profile. using the decoy set of prostar, the optimal parameters of wf and wc for residue-level potential are selected as  <dig>  and  <dig> , which correctly identifies  <dig> out of  <dig> decoy pairs. the optimal parameters of wf and wc for profile-level potential are selected as  <dig> and  <dig> , leading to correctly identify  <dig> out of  <dig> decoy pairs.

the profile-profile alignment method used here is the picasso <dig> method  <cit> , which gives the best results of fold recognition  <cit> . the profile-profile score to align the position i of a sequence q and the position j of a template t is given by:

mij=−∑k=120

where fikq, fikt, sikq and sikt are the frequencies and the position-specific score matrix  scores of amino acid k at position i of a sequence q and position j of a template t, respectively.

the profile-profile alignment is combined with the knowledge-based score for threading. the total score is given by:

utotal = mij + ws ej 

where ej is the combined potentials score of the template at position j with the residue type  or profile type  si of the position i of the query sequence, ws is the weight factors for structure scores. the dynamic programming algorithm is employed to find the minimum of the total score of the sequence-template alignments.

the homstrad database  <cit>  is selected to test the alignment accuracy of the two threading methods. only families containing two single-chain sequences and with sequence identities less than 40% are considered. the resulting dataset contains  <dig> families and is randomly divided into training set and test set with ratio of 4: <dig>  the genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal parameters on the training set including the structure factor ws, the gap-open penalty w <dig> and the gap-extension penalty w <dig>  such parameters are then applied to test the alignment accuracy on the test set. the results are shown in table  <dig>  the profile-level threading method outperforms the residue-level threading method, so profile-level statistical potentials can improve the performance of threading.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a class of novel knowledge-based mean force potentials at the profile level has been presented. the frequency profiles are directly calculated from the multiple sequence alignments outputted by psi-blast and converted into binary profiles with a probability threshold. such binary profiles make up of a new alphabet for protein sequence. because the binary profiles contain evolutionary information, they provide better descriptions of protein structures than the residues. we develop a class of novel statistical potentials at the profile level. fold assessment and decoy sets evaluation results show that the statistical potentials at the profile-level outperform those at the residue level. future work will aim at application of the profile-level statistical potentials to protein structure prediction and exploring other applications of such binary profiles such as remote homology detection, prediction of protein class etc.
