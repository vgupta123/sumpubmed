BACKGROUND
genomic resources and information about invasive species are valuable for evolutionary studies to determine how and why phenotypes specific to non-indigenous species have been formed  <cit> . moreover, they will aid ongoing efforts to understand and control the ecological, genetic and economic impacts of the invasive species. however, genomic or expressed sequence tag  resources required to identify candidate genes or genomic changes associated with invasiveness are not yet developed for most invasive species  <cit> . in fact, only few invasive species have had significant genomic resources developed for this purpose  <cit> . over the past several years, the next generation sequencing technology has significantly accelerated the speed of gene discovery and, is expected to boost genomics studies  <cit> . because this technology eliminates the need for cloning ests, which introduces bias, and has greatly increased the quantity of data that can be generated in a short time at a reduced cost compared with traditional sanger sequencing of cdna libraries  <cit> . this technology has been proved to be a valuable addition to evolutionary and ecological research for non-model organisms  <cit> . however, so far, few studies have explored the potential of using next generation sequencing to investigate the source of genetic variation underlying the evolution of an invasive species  <cit> .

the whitefly bemisia tabaci   has a global distribution with substantial genetic diversity and has been recorded over  <dig> species of plants  <cit> . recent phylogenetic analysis combined with a determination of a consistent pattern of reproductive isolation among many genetic groups within b. tabaci indicates that the whitefly is a complex containing at least  <dig> cryptic species   <cit> . two species of the complex, middle east-asia minor  <dig>  and mediterranean , as designated by dinsdale et al.  <cit>  and commonly referred to as the b and q 'biotype' respectively in the past  <dig> years, have risen to international prominence since the 1980s due to their global invasion  <cit> . the invasive ability and damage potential of meam <dig> has earned it a place as one of the world's top  <dig> invasive species http://www.issg.org <cit> . some effort has been made to understand the multiple factors that contribute to the incursion of the two species into new regions and habitats. for example, asymmetric mating interactions between meam <dig> and its indigenous competitors have been shown to play a major role in the invasion of meam <dig> into china and australia  <cit> . while both meam <dig> and med are known for their invasiveness, their biological characteristics are rather different. for example, the invasion of med seems more closely related to its strong resistance to major classes of insecticides  <cit> . several studies have revealed that the greater abundance of med relative to meam <dig> in israel and southern spain were associated with the higher levels of resistance to pyriproxyfen and neonicotinoids in med  <cit> . both species have been speculated to have a wide range of host plants, although up to date the knowledge of their actual host range is very limited partly due to the confusion of their species status in the past  <cit> . the experimental evidence available also shows clearly that the two species differ substantially in host range  <cit> , interactions with begomoviruses  <cit>  and mating behavior  <cit> . because of those differences between meam <dig> and med, competitive interactions between them where they co-occur are common and have significant impacts on their distribution. in zhejiang province of china, meam <dig> probably arrived in the late 1990s and has been rapidly displacing the indigenous species of the b. tabaci complex  <cit> . in  <dig>  med appeared and gradually replaced meam <dig> and has become the only or predominant b. tabaci in some locations  <cit> .

natural selection under different ecological and agricultural environments is likely to have driven the evolution and divergence between meam <dig> and med whiteflies and resulted in their reproductive isolation and biological differences. however, the molecular factors responsible for the differences between meam <dig> and med species are almost unknown. furthermore, we have no information about how natural selection may have affected the transcriptomes of these invasive whiteflies since their divergence from a common ancestor. so far, studies about sequences divergence in this whitefly species complex only focused on a few genes, such as cytochrome oxidase  <dig>  nuclear ribosomal intergenic transcribed spacer  <dig>  and 16s ribosomal dna, which are important molecules to differentiate genetic groups of b. tabaci  <cit> . the sequence divergence of acetylcholinesterase among different whitefly populations of meam <dig> has also been documented because of its role in insecticide resistance  <cit> . however, the investigations of individual genes can not provide an accurate description of genome wide dna sequence divergence. a more robust picture of genomics divergence between meam <dig> and med may be attained by examining large numbers of genes that have been selected without prior interest in their biological functions or evolutionary histories  <cit> . the transcriptome represents a sample of the spatiotemporally expressed genome and can be used as an entry into the genome divergence study  <cit> .

previously, we have sequenced the transcriptome of med using illumina sequencing technology and demonstrated that this technology allows de novo transcriptome assembly in a species lacking genome information  <cit> . in this study, we generated over one billion bases of high-quality dna sequence for meam <dig> with illumina technology. based on these dna sequences, we identified  <dig>  distinct sequences including hundreds of insecticide target and metabolism genes. to reveal the genetic differences between meam <dig> and med, we compared the sequence variations between them and identified a number of orthologous genes that show signs of diversifying natural selection. the assembled, annotated transcriptome sequences of meam <dig> provide an invaluable resource for the identification of whitefly genes involved in biological invasion, insecticide resistance and host adaptation. the identification of divergent sequences between med and meam <dig> opens the door for future investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological variations between them.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and reads assembly of meam <dig> transcriptome
to obtain an overview of the meam <dig> whitefly transcriptome, a cdna sample was prepared from a mixture of rna from egg & nymph, pupa, female adult and male adult at equal ratio, and sequenced using the illumina sequencing platform. we obtained a total of  <dig> million of  <dig> bp reads, which have been deposited in the ncbi short read archive  under the accession number: srx <dig>  these raw reads were assembled using soapdenovo software and resulted in  <dig>  contigs   <cit> . the contigs were assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds using paired-end joining and gap-filling  . the  <dig>  scaffolds were further clustered into  <dig>  distinct sequences including  <dig> clusters and  <dig>  singletons . in this article, a cluster means a sequence composed of several scaffolds and the singleton means a scaffold that matches no other scaffolds. next, we analyzed the length distribution of the  <dig>  distinct sequences. as shown in figure  <dig>  although nearly 70% of the sequences  are between  <dig> to  <dig> bp, we identified  <dig>  sequences longer than  <dig>  bp.

annotation of predicted proteins and gene ontology classification
for functional annotation, distinct gene sequences were searched using blastx against the non-redundant  ncbi nucleotide database using a cut-off e-value of  <dig> Ã— 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig>  genes returned an above cut-off blast result representing about  <dig> % of all distinct sequences . the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database showed that  <dig> % of the mapped sequences have strong homology , whereas  <dig> % of the homolog sequences ranged between  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> . likewise, the similarity distribution showed that 39% of the sequences have a similarity higher than 60%, while 61% of the hits have a similarity ranging from 18% to 60% . similar to the results of med transcriptome  <cit> , the highest percentage of meam <dig> sequences were matched to the pea aphid  , followed by the body louse  , red flour beetle   and honey bee   . gene ontology  assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted meam <dig> whitefly genes. based on sequence homology,  <dig>  sequences can be categorized into  <dig> functional groups under three main divisions . next, we compared the go of meam <dig> and med whitefly transcriptomes  <cit>  and found that the distributions of gene functions from these two species are extremely similar . this expected result indicates that there is no bias in the construction of the libraries from the meam <dig> and med whiteflies. compared to the med transcriptome which has  <dig>  sequences with go annotation  <cit> , the number of sequences with go annotation in meam <dig>  is lower. this is probably due to the differences in the amount of sequencing data generated from the two samples . for both species, in the three main divisions  of the go classification, 'cell part', 'binding' and 'cellular process', terms are dominant respectively. for both species, we also noticed a high-percentage of genes from categories of 'cell', 'catalytic' and 'metabolic process' .

identification and analysis of the orthologous genes between med and meam1
to compare the sequence divergence of the two species, we analyzed the possible orthologous genes between their transcriptomes using bidirectional best hit which has been widely used to identify orthologous genes  <cit> . by this way, we identified  <dig>  pairs of putative orthologs with an average length of  <dig> bp and  <dig> % identity . to remove potential paralogs, these putative orthologous genes were further screened against the swissprot database. only pairs of sequences that mapped unambiguously to the same protein in swissprot database with an e-value <  <dig> Ã— 10- <dig> were selected as orthologous genes. among these sequence pairs,  <dig>  pairs of sequences could be mapped unambiguously to the same protein, suggesting strongly that they are orthologous genes . the untranslated region  of each sequence pair was identified based on the predicted coding region. among the  <dig>  pairs of orthologs,  <dig> pairs contain 5'utr and  <dig> pairs contain 3'utr. after removing the utrs, we obtained the coding sequences  of all the orthologs. the cds sequences containing unexpected stop codon and shorter than  <dig> bp were further filtered, resulting in  <dig>  pairs of orthologous cds sequences . the average length of the  <dig>  orthologous genes is  <dig>  bp with an average similarity of  <dig> %. the average gc content of orthologous cds is  <dig> % , a value slightly higher than that of pea aphid genome  and apis mellifera genome   <cit> . however, the gc contents in the utr regions of meam <dig> are  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  which is slightly lower than that of the pea aphid and honeybee genomes. considering the large percentage of noncoding sequences in the whitefly genome  <cit> , the overall gc content of the whitefly should be comparable to that of the pea aphid and honeybee. the  <dig>  translated genes were annotated and classified using kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database . given the differences between meam <dig> and med, we propose that these pathways represent a transcriptome involved in core cellular and physiological functions common to the two whitefly species.

the sequence divergence between meam <dig> and med
for the 5'utr, the gc content is  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the compared nucleotides occur in cpg contexts . differences between 5'utrs of med and meam <dig> orthologous genes occur at  <dig> % of the positions. interestingly, cpg sites in the 5'utr differ at  <dig> % of positions, whereas non-cpg sites differ at  <dig> %. thus, within 5'utrs, differences occur approximately  <dig>  times more often at cpg sites than at non-cpg sites. for the 3'utr, the gc content is  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the nucleotides are in a cpg context. the overall difference of 3'utr between med and meam <dig> is  <dig> %. cpg and non-cpg sites differ at  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. hence, in the 3'utr, cpg sites contain  <dig>  times more differences than non-cpg sites. these results suggest that a substantial proportion of the dna sequence divergence between the two species is caused by changes at cpg sites. to understand the mechanism of evolution, we compared the ratio of transition  and transversion   <cit> . overall, the transitional differences are  <dig>  times more frequent than transversional differences in 5'utrs . interestingly, the transition-transversion ratio is higher in the cpg positions  than the non-cpg positions . this is consistent with the suggestion that the predominant type of mutations in the cpg sites is cytosine deamination, which results in transitional differences  <cit> . as in 5'utr, transitional substitutions at 3'utr are more common than transversions  and transitions are even more frequent than transversions at cpg sites  compared with non-cpg sites . when comparing divergences of 3'utr and 5'utr, the overall and non-cpg sites divergence of 3'utr is slightly lower than that at 5'utr. however, for the cpg sites, the divergence at 3'utr is higher than that of 5'utr . therefore, the mutation rates are likely to differ for cpg sites in different regions of genes. it reflects differences in mutational pressures between these regions because of differential methylation rate, which is also consistent with the finding that the transition/transversion rate is higher in the 3'utrs than in the 5'utrs .

among the  <dig>  orthologous gene pairs, the overall divergence in coding regions is  <dig> %. in non-cpg sites, the divergence is slightly lower ; whereas in the cpg sites, the divergence  is  <dig>  times as high as that of non-cpg sites. apart from cpg context, the nucleotides in coding regions can further be classified as non-degenerative  sites  and four fold degenerate  sites . from a total of  <dig>  kb of coding region sequences,  <dig>  kb are nd sites, whereas  <dig> kb are 4d sites . at nd sites the overall divergence is  <dig> %, whereas the overall divergence at 4d sites  is  <dig>  times that at the nd sites. the results indicate that the nd sites evolve under extensive functional constraints because any nucleotide substitutions at nd sites will produce amino acid changes. at nd sites, the gc content is  <dig> % and the cpg content  <dig> %. at nd sites, the non-cpg sites divergence between med and meam <dig> is  <dig> % and the divergence at cpg sites is  <dig> % which is  <dig> times the non-cpg sites divergence. at the 4d sites, the gc content is  <dig> %, whereas the cpg content is much higher . at cpg sites, the divergence is  <dig> % which is  <dig> times that at the non-cpg sites . these results demonstrate that the higher percentage of divergence at the 4d sites is proportional to both the content of cpg sites and the rate of mutation.

synonymous and non synonymous sites
to identify genes undergoing purifying and positive selections, we estimated rates of nonsynonymous  and synonymous  substitutions between meam <dig> and med ortholog pairs. among the  <dig>  pairs of cds, both a ka and a ks rate could be calculated for  <dig>  orthologs . for the rest of the gene pairs, we could calculate either only ka or ks. the  <dig>  sequence pairs had mean values of ka, ks, and ka/ks of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the ka/ks ratio has been widely used to measure the intensity and mode of selection under which a cds is evolving. ka/ks >  <dig> is interpreted as a sign of positive selections and ka/ks <  <dig> is a signature of purifying selections  <cit> . of the  <dig>  sequence pairs with a ka and a ks rate,  <dig> orthologous gene pairs have a ka/ks value larger than  <dig> and  <dig> genes have a ka/ks value between  <dig>  and  <dig> . among the sequences with ka/ks values >  <dig>  a couple of genes are involved in sugar and amino acids metabolic processes suggesting those processes are under strongly positive selection and are critical to the specialization of the whiteflies . for example, the alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase , which is a key enzyme for the synthesis of trehalose, has the highest ka/ks value . the amino acid sequences comparison of the tps revealed that, in the mema <dig> species, a highly conserved glutamic acid residue in the catalytic domain is replaced by an alanine   <cit> . except the sequences with high ka/ks, many sequences had ka/ks values equal to or only slightly greater than zero, suggesting that these genes have evolved under high selective constraint   <cit> .

analysis of sequences with weak amino-acid similarity
to determine the transcriptome-wide levels of coding sequence divergence, we calculated the sequence homology of orthologous genes between med and meam <dig>  the  <dig>  sequence pairs had a mean homology of  <dig> % and ranged from 92% to 100% . the large variation in sequence homology suggests that estimated values of species divergence based on few genes may produce misleading results. among these sequence pairs,  <dig> show 100% homology, suggesting these genes are well conserved between med and meam <dig> . to reveal the proteins responsible for the differences between the two species, we analyzed the sequence pairs with weak amino-acid similarity. interestingly, many of the divergent genes are related to sugar, protein and amino acid metabolism, such as aminopeptidase , oligopeptide transporter , aspartate aminotransferase  and galactose oxidase  . the sequence divergences of these genes may cause functional differences in corresponding enzymes and result in the biological variations between med and meam <dig>  furthermore, we noticed that a couple of proteins involved in insecticide resistance are also highly divergent, such as cytochrome p <dig> 4c <dig>  and glutathione s-transferase . it was previously observed that the resistance to pesticides appeared to be enhanced by cytochrome p <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we compared the protein sequence of the med cytochrome p <dig> 4c <dig> with that of meam <dig> . sequence alignment showed that the med whitefly cytochrome p <dig> 4c <dig> is clearly different with the meam <dig> homolog. the relevance of these mutations in pesticide resistance requires further investigation.

discussion
for the b. tabaci complex,  <dig> cryptic species have been delineated based on a number of phylogenetic analysis and reproductive isolation studies; however, the evolutionary origin and basal taxa have not been ascertained. furthermore, the genetic factors associated with the evolution of invasive whitefly species are almost unknown. this is partially due to the fact that few molecules are available for inferring the evolutionary history and genetic divergence of b. tabaci. so far, only the mitochondrial 16s dna, cytochrome oxidase  <dig> and the nuclear ribosomal intergenic spacer have been explored  <cit> . in this study, we have identified nearly  <dig>  ortholog gene pairs and determined the average sequence divergence between meam <dig> and med to be  <dig> % for the cds. this is much higher than the reported mean  <dig> % divergence at the coding region between human and chimpanzee  <cit> . the gene divergence at the non-coding regions is even more obvious for 5'utr  and 3'utr  regions - nearly  <dig>  times the divergence between the 5'utr  and 3'utr  regions of human and chimpanzee  <cit> . in addition, it is likely that our analyses might have underestimated the level of divergence between the two species. the orthologous genes were identified with very high stringency  which may have filtered out genes that have diversified in response to selection and no longer exhibit similarity significant enough to be identified with blast  <cit> . this strictness could have biased our data set toward more conserved sequences. altogether, these results indicate that despite high-sequence identity in their cds, the meam <dig> and med species have diverged substantially between their transcriptomes. the level of sequence divergence provides additional support to the proposition that meam <dig> and med are two species  <cit> , in addition to the evidence of reproductive isolation  <cit> .

previous studies have shown that meam <dig> and med differ in many life history parameters, such as mating behavior, insecticide resistance and host plant utilization  <cit> . interestingly, we have identified a number of divergent sequences which might contribute to these biological differences between the two species. for example, meam <dig> and med have different capacity to utilize various host plants and weeds  <cit> . in this study, we found that a number of genes involved in sugar and amino acid utilization are highly divergent, such as alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase, oligopeptide transporter, aminopeptidase and galactose oxidase. further functional characterization and comparison of these enzymes in meam <dig> and med might reveal the molecular mechanisms underneath those differences. we also noticed that a couple of genes involved in insecticide resistance, such as cytochrome p <dig> 4c <dig> and glutathione s-transferase, are clearly divergent between meam <dig> and med. these differences might be responsible for the higher insecticide resistance of the med species  <cit> . nonetheless, the functions of those proteins in driving the evolution and divergence of the meam <dig> and med species need to be further characterized.

the higher level of similarity observed in the cds could be attributable to the presence of purifying natural selection on the cds of the genes. to estimate the extent to which selection affects protein-coding dna sequences, we calculated the number of nucleotide substitutions that change amino acids  and the number of substitutions that do not . among the  <dig>  pairs of transcript compared, the average ka/ks ratio is  <dig> . surprisingly, this ratio is remarkably similar to the average ka/ks ratio of rat and mouse coding region  and ka/ks ratio of human and chimpanzee   <cit> . this is unexpected because the effective population size is much larger in whiteflies than in rodents and humans, which should have resulted in more effective selection against deleterious variants  <cit> . the ratio of ka/ks is a good indicator of selective pressure and has been used to identify protein-coding genes under positive and purifying selection  <cit> . of the  <dig>  orthologous pairs for which ka and ks could be calculated,  <dig> have ka/ks >  <dig>  suggesting that those sequences might play important roles in the speciation and adaptive evolution of the whitefly. while the genes we have earmarked through this study are suitable subjects for future research, more rigorous statistical tests of positive selection, using multiple sequence samples, are required to confirm current results as well as to detect specific codons undergoing adaptive change.

major advances in transcriptomics have become feasible in non-model organisms as a result of technology developments in next-generation sequencing. this study dramatically increased the number of genes from the meam <dig> whitefly   <cit> . together with the med whitefly transcriptome  <cit> , we can provide an initial estimate of the number of transcribed genes in the whitefly. by reciprocal best match, we have identified  <dig>  homologous sequences between meam <dig> and med. those  <dig>  sequences were separately sequenced and assembled during the illumina sequencing suggesting strongly that they are valid transcripts. as many distinct sequences represent nonoverlapping portions of the same transcript, this number is probably an overestimation of the actual genes and can be considered as an upper-bound of our library. for gene annotation,  <dig>  sequences of the meam <dig> transcriptome have significant swissprot hits with a minimum e-value of  <dig> Ã— 10- <dig> and  <dig>  med sequences have a significant hit  <cit> . as many of these swissprot hits are likely to be duplicates , we analyzed the unique gene names identified during these blast searches. among these swissprot hits,  <dig>  unique gene names were identified during the blast search of the meam <dig> transcriptome and  <dig>  unique gene names were identified for the med transcriptome . considering both sets of results, the lower-bound of genes for the whitefly transcriptome should be more than  <dig> . in fact, many assembled sequences lack matches to public database because they are either too short to permit appropriate alignments or represent highly divergent genes. for example, about 20% of the genes in the pea aphid , the closest relative of b. tabaci with a sequenced genome, showed no homology to other metazoan genes  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that the minimum number of genes in the whitefly will exceed  <dig> . although a precise estimation of transcriptome coverage is unachievable without the full genome information, our collection of unique transcripts represents a substantial percentage of the genes from the genome of b. tabaci.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to use illumina sequencing to rapidly characterize multiple transcriptomes and compare their differences in an invasive non-model species. the level of sequence divergence is consistent with the previous proposition that meam <dig> and med whiteflies are two species. furthermore, we have identified hundreds of sequences showing high sequence divergence and found  <dig> genes under strong positive selection. the divergent sequences identified in this study will be an invaluable resource for studies of whitefly speciation, invasion, insecticide resistance and host plant utilization. to our knowledge, this is the first attempt using illumina sequencing to study the transcriptome divergence of invasive species. we anticipate that this methodology holds great potential for the identification of genetic variation underlying the evolution of other invasive species.
