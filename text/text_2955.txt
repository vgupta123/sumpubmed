BACKGROUND
it is now well known that the position of the nucleosome along a particular sequence of dna has profound effects on its accessibility for all dna processes such as transcription regulation, recombination, and repair  <cit> . for example, the nucleosome over the core promoter region of the pathogenesis-related gene  of tobacco is remodeled on induction with salicylic acid   <cit> . this suggests that the underlying dna sequence and histone modifications play their role in gene activation, leading to the sliding of nucleosomes from the pr-1a core promoter. several reports suggest that the position of the nucleosome is critical in globally regulating the in vivo binding of transcription factors by either allowing or blocking their binding to the nucleosome  <cit> . a nucleosome-depleted region  close to the transcription start site  is usually flanked by upstream and downstream positioned nucleosomes  that are often the starting points for the regular nucleosomal arrays. protein factors along with the dna and histone have a necessary role in nucleosome positioning  <cit> . in a previous study, five in vivo packing mechanisms of nucleosome organization have also been proposed for the nucleosomes in yeast  <cit> .

genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positions of eukaryotic genomes is a prerequisite to understand the basic mechanism of chromosomal organization. previously genome-wide nucleosome positioning has been mapped and analyzed in saccharomyces cerevisiae, drosophila melanogaster, homo sapiens, caenorhabditis elegans and a. thaliana  <cit> . different techniques have been used to assay nucleosome positioning in chromatin; for example, whole-genome tiling-microarray using mononucleosomal dna  <cit> , micrococcal nuclease -sequencing  <cit> , which provides in-depth data on genome-wide nucleosomal positioning, etc.

previously a study of global nucleosome positioning in a. thaliana has concluded for the first time that the nucleosomes are more densely packed in pericentromeric regions containing heavily methylated dna than in the euchromatin region  <cit> . taking into account the role of nucleosome in regulating eukaryotic transcription, it would be tempting to explore genome-wide nucleosomal dynamics in the context of transcriptional perturbation. since plants are sessile organisms, they have developed intricate self defense mechanisms that enable them to cope with both biotic and abiotic stresses. the mechanism generally operates by generating the systemic acquired resistance  response mainly through sa-regulated and jasmonic acid -regulated pathways with many other hormones  <cit> . this leads to massive changes in gene expression  <cit> . npr <dig> has emerged as a key component which plays a significant role in regulation of these pathways and their cross-talk  <cit> . the molecule exists in the cytoplasm in multimeric form and is reduced to monomeric form to enter nucleus on being induced with sa. overall, massive transcriptional reprogramming may be regulated at the chromatin level by nucleosomal remodeling. thus, the present study aims at understanding the possible relationship between the dynamics of global nucleosomal positioning and sa-mediated transcriptional regulation in a. thaliana.

briefly, we have mapped global nucleosome positioning in a. thaliana chromosomes under both control and sa-treated conditions. we have also correlated the changes in nucleosome positioning to the global transcriptional response to sa in a. thaliana. our results report distinct chromatin remodeling in core promoter and 5′ upstream promoter regulatory regions of sa-induced genes. we also find a distinct role of non-expresser of pr <dig>  in the nucleosomal remodeling in sa-regulated genes. for this, we identify sa- regulated npr1-dependent  and npr1-independent  genes by performing the whole genome expression analysis under control and sa-treated conditions both in the wild-type and the npr <dig> mutant plants. the nucleosomal occupancy study of these groups reveals a correlation between sa-regulated nd genes and the dependence of npr <dig> for nucleosomal remodeling at their core promoter region. we also find many defense related motifs both in the core promoter region and in the upstream regulatory region of sa regulated genes. while some of these are present in the nucleosome occupied regions , rest others are present in the nucleosome free region .

methods
plant growth conditions and treatment with sa
seed sterilization and plant growth conditions were followed as reported earlier  <cit>  for both a. thaliana col- <dig>  and npr1- <dig> mutant. all seeds were grown in vitro in ms  medium by keeping them on a mesh for stratification at 4°c for 2 days before placing them in the growth chamber. a. thaliana plants were grown under controlled environmental conditions . after two weeks of growth, the medium was exchanged either with water or with 2 mm sa, followed by 24 h incubation in light at 22 ± 1°c.

nuclei isolation and digestion with mnase1
the nuclei were isolated as described  <cit> , with slight modifications. briefly, 10 g of seedlings  were treated either with water or sa, rinsed with water, blotted dry, and ground to powder in liquid nitrogen. nuclei isolation buffer nib <dig> ,  <dig>  mm edta,  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to it. the extract was first filtered through a 4-layered muslin cloth and then sequentially through  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 20 μm mesh sieves. the filtrate was centrifuged at 3000 g at 4°c for 10 min. the pellet was suspended in nib <dig>  and centrifuged again. the pellet was suspended in 5% percoll , loaded on a 20–80% percoll step gradient, and centrifuged. the nuclei were removed from the 20–80% percoll interface, washed in nib <dig>  and resuspended in nib <dig> buffer. the nuclear preparation was incubated with micrococcal nuclease  in a buffer containing 25 mm kcl, 4 mm mgcl <dig>  1 mm cacl <dig>  50 mm tris-cl , and  <dig> % glycerol at 37°c for 10 min at the concentration of 1unit/μg of genomic dna from untreated sample and  <dig> unit/μg of genomic dna from treated sample . the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2% sds,  <dig>  m nacl, 10 mm edta, 10 mm egta, and 50 mm tris-cl ; treated with proteinase k  for 1 h at 55°c, then with rnase a  at 37°c for 30 min, extracted by phenol: chloroform, and precipitated in ethanol. the dna was separated on  <dig> % agarose gel, and fragments of an average size of 150 bp were purified . the experiment was repeated three times each for control and sa-treated seedlings.

the control genomic dna for the hybridization experiments was prepared from nuclear genomic dna extraction and sonicated to obtain fragments of an approximate size of 200–500 bp. the experiment was repeated two times.

tiling array experiment
isolated mononucleosomal dna fragments  and genomic control dna were amplified with random primers , klenow fragment  and 25 mm dntp  in 20 μl aliquots for a total volume of 100 μl that was sufficient to obtain approximately 10 μg of purified pcr products for each sample. the pcr products were purified with the pcr cleanup kit . fragmentation and labeling was done as per affymetrix chip assay protocol  using genechip® wt double-stranded dna terminal labeling kit . hybridization, washing, and staining were done according to the affymetrix chromatin immunoprecipitation assay protocol onto genechip® a. thaliana tiling  <dig> r array  using genechip® hybridization, wash, and stain kit  on affymetrix fluidics station  <dig> according to the manufacturer’s protocol. arrays were scanned on an affymetrix genechip®  <dig> 7g scanner, and the signals were quantified with the affymetrix genechip® operating software  to generate cel files. the data can be found in ncbi public repository as gse <dig>  <cit> . the experiments were performed in similar way for all the eight templates .

processing of tiling array data
in the subsequent analysis, raw data from all probes were mapped onto tair <dig>  tiling analysis software  from affymetrix technology was used to analyze tiling array data , which included the use of quantile normalization, probe analysis, and two-sample analysis to generate normalized log <dig> transformed values. the two-sample comparison analysis included datasets, either control versus genomic or sa-treated versus genomic, that could help in identifying consistently differentially enriched regions along the genome in control and sa-treated conditions respectively as compared to background region. since genomic dna was randomly sheared dna, the comparison also yielded negative log <dig> transformed signal intensity values for certain probe sets in both cases. throughout this article, this log <dig> transformed signal intensity value has been directly referred to as enrichment value. these enrichment values were then used for further analysis in a comparative fashion in order to determine the nucleosomal remodeling across the genome.

definition of stringency level
seven different enrichment values  have been used as seven stringency levels. for example, stringency level ≥ <dig>  means that if a probe has enrichment value ≥ <dig> , then only it may serve as a nucleosomal signal, not otherwise.

development of custom scripts
four different custom scripts were developed to predict nucleosomal occupied regions from the signal intensity data of tas  in different steps –c script to develop the dataset of distinct and fuzzy nucleosomes: tab separated file containing the genomic positions and the log <dig> transformed signal intensity values from all the three replicates was used as input for both control and sa treated datasets to get the nucleosomal regions  at different stringency levels. for a given stringency level, the presence of a nucleosome is inferred, if the enrichment value is ≥ the value of the stringency level continuously at  <dig> probes  or at > <dig> probes  in all the three replicates in the dataset under study. for example, for inferring the presence of a distinct nucleosome at stringency level ≥ <dig> , four continuous probes should have enrichment value ≥ <dig> .

perl script to develop a database of global positions of tss, start codon, stop codon, and mrna end for all the genes along all the five chromosomes of a. thaliana from tair <dig> tabular files.

c script to find out the remodeled nucleosomal regions and common nucleosomal regions: the nucleosomal regions present either only in control conditions or only in sa treated conditions were considered as remodeled nucleosomal regions and the nucleosomal regions present in both conditions were considered as the common nucleosomal regions for the purpose of input data in this script.

c script to search every 50 bp window size for the nucleosomal coverage of 1000 bp upstream and downstream from tss site of the genes in different groups: two different input files were used –the strand position  and the tss  of gene.

the nucleosomal dataset both for distinct and fuzzy nucleosomes .





if a continuous stretch of ≥25 bp was predicted to be having nucleosome occupancy in 50 bp window, then it was marked as count  <dig> . on the other hand, if the continuous nucleosome coverage was <25 bp in 50 bp window, then it was marked as count  <dig> .

all of these scripts are available at http://ncgd.nbri.res.in/nucleosome_prediction.aspx.

identification of genome-wide nucleosome regions in control and sa-treated conditions
a total of  <dig> datasets were developed over seven stringency levels, two conditions and two types  of nucleosomes for the five chromosomes using first custom script. nucleosome regions covering an area of 131–161 bp represented distinct nucleosomes and the nucleosome regions covering an area ≥161 bp represented fuzzy nucleosomes.

calculation of nucleosomal coverage over different parts of gene
the tiling array data were mapped for all the five chromosomes, and the nucleosome occupancy was calculated in different parts of the genes identified using second custom script. the nucleosomal coverage was calculated at stringency ≥− <dig>  as size of the chromosome  divided by the total region covered by nucleosomes  for all the five chromosomes of a. thaliana .

identification of remodeled nucleosomes on sa treatment
nucleosomal regions were identified for the following conditions using third custom scriptregions having nucleosomes shifted/removed under sa-treated condition as compared to control condition.

regions having nucleosomes added under sa-treated condition as compared to control condition.

regions retaining nucleosomes under both conditions.



the first two regions taken together  formed a remodeled nucleosomal region, whereas all regions taken together formed total nucleosomal coverage .

rna extraction
total rna was isolated from two week old seedlings  in two independent biological replicates using spectrum plant total rna kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted with nuclease-free water. after dnasei  treatment, the rna was quantified and checked for integrity using a bioanalyzer .

rna amplification and labeling
direct labeling procedure was used i.e., double-stranded cdna was synthesized using 250 ng total rna, either with an oligo-dt primer  or a t <dig> promoter-containing oligo  primer, followed by in vitro transcription and labeling using a genechip® 3′ ivt express kit  to generate crna as per manufacturer’s protocol.

microarray hybridization
the crna was fragmented to approx. < <dig> bases, hybridized to ath <dig> genome chip and were incubated at 45°c temperature for 16 hrs at 60 rpm in hybridization chamber. washing and staining was performed by using an affymetrix fluidics station  <dig> according to the manufacturer’s instructions . the arrays were scanned using gene chip scanner  <dig> 7g . scanned images were processed and analyzed using gcos software . the data has been deposited in ncbi .

image acquisition and statistical analysis of salicylic acid treated oligonucleotide microarray data
arrays images were captured and then raw cel files were analyzed using affylmgui biocondcutor r package for robust multi-array average  algorithm  <cit>  by performing model-based background correction, normalization and summarization across the probe level. identification of statistically significant  differentially expressed genes as determined by affylmgui biocondcutor r package was done using the fold change criteria .

identification of sa induced , sa repressed  and uninduced genes
the fold change criteria along with p-values ≤ <dig>  has been used to classify the genes in different groups.genes with log <dig> fold change ≥ <dig> were considered as up-regulated, hence were called as si genes,

genes with fold change ≤− <dig> were considered as down-regulated, hence were called as sr group,

uninduced genes with an equal and consistent expression profile in all the replicates of sa and control array files were grouped into silent  genes  and constitutive  genes .



identification of nd and ni genes
expression profiling experiments were performed for both wild-type and npr1- <dig> mutants under untreated and treated conditions  for the identification of nd and ni genes. thereafter, two-way anova was used under r script developed by pavlidis et al.  <cit>  for selecting statistically significant sa-regulated nd and sa-regulated ni genes. normalized log <dig> transformed values of all replicates of untreated and treated col- <dig> and npr1- <dig> mutant array files were processed for anova analysis. genes with adjusted p-value ≤ <dig>  were considered as sa regulated genes . for sa-regulated nd genes, the genes with p-value ≤ <dig>   were selected while for sa-regulated ni genes p-value ≥ <dig>  were selected.

further, sa-regulated nd genes were classified into two groups i.e. si-nd and sr-nd genes based on the fold change value of the genes upon sa treatment in wild-type plants. similarly, sa-regulated ni genes were classified into two groups i.e. si-ni and sr-ni genes.

quantitative pcr for the analysis of nucleosomal occupancy and transcript abundance
for validating the ≥− <dig>  stringency level, primers were designed both from the regions showing the presence of the nucleosome in both control and sa-treated conditions  and from the regions showing the absence of the nucleosome in both control and sa-treated conditions , as depicted in our tiling array analysis  using primer express software . the pcr efficiency of all the primers was checked by using the a. thaliana genomic dna as a template. qpcr was carried out using abi taqman chemistry with untreated mononucleosomal dna template on abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system . the ct  value for each gene was determined and qpcr data analysis was done by comparing ct values  <cit> . the experiments were repeated twice with at least  <dig> biological replicates.

to assess the effect of npr <dig> on nucleosomal occupancy on the promoter region in all the six groups, mononucleosomes were prepared as described earlier from both treated and untreated wild-type and npr1- <dig> mutant seedlings. next, qpcr was performed for the assessment of nucleosomal occupancy at the promoter loci of three representative genes for each class . for the internal control set, five exonic regions  were selected; the selected exons did not show nucleosomal remodeling on sa treatment. moreover, they did not belong to any groups such as si, sr, nd, or ni. the average ct values of each of the three genes was normalized to the average ct values of a complete set of internal control genes to obtain Δct values. similar treatment was followed for all the sets; that is, wild-type control , wild-type sa treated , npr1- <dig> control , and npr1- <dig> sa treated . thereafter, the average Δct value for the set of three genes was determined and average fold change was calculated and plotted along with standard error . student’s t-test was applied to test the significance of the changes under both conditions in wild-type versus mutant plants in a pair-wise manner.

analysis of the relative transcript abundance of each group  was done using total rna for each group prepared under similar conditions and using the same analyses strategy as done for studying nucleosomal occupancy described earlier.

mapping of the nucleosomal coverage
only the regions consisting of −1000 bp to +1000 bp with respect to tss of a particular gene were considered for this purpose. overlapping coordinates or genomic regions were filtered from − <dig> to +1000 bp region with respect to tss in all genes in the constitutive , silent , sa induced , sa repressed , sa induced-nd , sa repressed-nd , sa induced-ni , and sa repressed-ni  groups. these regions were then removed from each group. the regions were mapped for the nucleosomal coverage  using fourth custom script. statistical significance analysis at a p-value ≤ <dig>  was performed using student’s t-test  for each window in all the groups. only the adjusted p-values ≤ <dig>   were considered as significant.

calculation of nucleosomal remodeling
the presence or absence of a nucleosome in − <dig> to +1000 bp-long region was calculated on per gene basis for all genes for both control and sa-treated conditions in different groups . based on the remodeling at each position, percentage of the genes showing remodeling was calculated for each position for all groups. a graph representing the percentage of genes having nucleosome at each position was drawn along with the statistical significance data for comparison between different groups. statistical analysis was done for − <dig> to +1000 bp region with respect to tss over a window of 150 bp  to find differences in the form of nucleosomal enrichment and nucleosomal depletion at the proximal promoter region among si versus unaffected groups  and sr versus unaffected groups, si-nd versus si-ni and sr-nd versus sr-ni. for this, student’s t-test  was applied along with the q-value package for multiple hypothesis testing correction. only the adjusted p-values ≤ <dig>  were considered as significant.

gene ontology analysis
all the groups were analyzed for their enriched gene ontologies using agrigo software  <cit>  under sea  using fischer statistical test under adjusted p-values ≤ <dig>  using yekutieli method.

prediction of nucleosomal occupied, nucleosomal free and remodeled nucleosomal regions
third custom script was used to count the number of nucleosomal occupied, nucleosomal free and remodeled nucleosomal regions in the dataset of different groups. nucleosomal bases were calculated in control as well as sa treated condition. common nucleosomal bases present in the both the conditions were also calculated. remodeled nucleosomal bases were calculated by subtracting the common nucleosomal bases from total nucleosomal bases .

motif finding methods
a) for si genes: remodeled nucleosomal regions   of  <dig> bp upstream regions from si genes  were extracted from tair <dig> database. motif analysis was done for these regions. meme   <cit>  was deployed using zoops model  to these regions. it identified several interesting motifs which were annotated with place  <cit>  database.

b) for sr genes: the promoter regions − <dig> to − <dig> upstream tss  of si and sr genes were extracted from tair <dig> database. additionally, as control dataset, the remodeled nucleosomal regions  from whole genome of a. thaliana  were used to identify novel cis-regulatory elements specifically enriched in sr genes  present in the remodeled regions. a database was constructed consisting of all possible combinations of  <dig> bases length. thereafter, the motif analysis was done using following two methods:i) lift method

lift  <cit>  was calculated for the database containing all the possible combinations in si versus w and sr versus w. finally, the ratio of both was calculated to find out the enriched motif of sr with respect to si.

ii) motif enrichment  method

the expected occurrence of a particular hexameric motif was counted by the method used for counting w-box and tga motifs. thereafter, the ratios between observed and expected occurrence for each motif found in the si and w remodeled regions were calculated. similarly, the ratios between observed and expected occurrence for each motif found in the sr and w remodeled regions was also calculated. finally, ratio of motifs enriched in sr as compared to w and the motif enriched in si as compared to w was calculated to obtain enriched motif in sr genes with respect to si genes.



nucleosome coverage on w box and tga motifs
nucleosomal regions from the 1000 bp upstream tss  were extracted for all the groups. in these regions, the enrichment of cis-regulatory w-box motif  and tga motif  was independently calculated for the following four regions:total promoter region,

region having the nucleosome occupied under both conditions ,

region lacking the nucleosome under any of the two conditions , and

regions with remodeled nucleosomes.



first of all, the local nucleotide frequency  of a base was calculated in the above mentioned regions as per the formula –

say, t = total no of all bases in a particular region

then f = /t

thereafter, the expected frequency of occurrence of a particular cis-regulatory motif was calculated based on the local nucleotide frequency of each constituent base of the motif under study using the following formula: e=∏1nfn∗t e = expected occurrence of the motif, n = number of the constituent bases in the motif.

the occurrence of these motifs has been further corrected for their expected frequency of occurrences and for the differences due to database sizes for total number of promoters, nors, remodeled nucleosomes, and nfrs. the corrected frequency of occurrence of a particular motif was calculated by normalizing the observed frequency with the expected frequency of their occurrence. next, graphs showing the significance of each motif in all groups were plotted at 95% binomial confidence interval with respect to the total promoter region.

RESULTS
global mapping of nucleosome positioning on the a. thaliana genome
the mnase <dig> digestion strategy is widely used to map nucleosome position and occupancy, based on its ability to produce sequence-dependent cleavages in dna preferentially within linker regions. an earlier publication  <cit>  claims that the mapping of nucleosome positioning using mnase <dig> generates a sequence-dependent bias in the resulting fragments, which may affect sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. still, it is unlikely that such biasness is differentially influenced by sa treatment. hence, it can be safely used to understand differential nucleosome positioning in a. thaliana on sa treatment. to determine the changes in the nucleosome positions that eventually lead to changes in the gene expression, 2-week old control or sa-treated a. thaliana seedlings were used for mononucleosomal dna preparation . the mononucleosomal dna was then hybridized to affymetrix genechip® arabidopsis tiling  <dig> r array. custom scripts were developed and used for assigning nucleosomes where nucleosomes were identified at different stringency levels . pr <dig>  is a marker gene of the sa pathway. earlier, it was demonstrated by us in case of nicotiana tabacum that a distinct nucleosome spans the tata-box and tss of pr-1a minimal promoter at the resting state, which gets remodeled and removed on activation with sa  <cit> . pr <dig> in a. thaliana, similar to tobacco pr-1a, is also an sa-induced npr1-dependent gene; thus, pr <dig> was selected to validate the results obtained by tiling microarray on sa-induced npr1-dependent genes. the a. thaliana pr <dig> gene  is located on the reverse strand of chromosome 2; its genic region spans from position  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig>  encompassing the promoter region which spans from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> with distinct tata-box at position  <dig> , <dig> . the nucleosome positioning around pr <dig> gene in the tiling microarray data was examined. at stringency level ≥ − <dig>  under control condition, nucleosome signals were observed spanning from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,879; covering aug, tss, and tata-box ; and extending further into both the promoter region and the region downstream tss, indicating the presence of many nucleosomes in that region. after sa induction, distinct mnase <dig> sensitivity was observed in this region and, thus, lack of hybridization signals around the region − <dig> to +78 bp, indicating the nucleosomal remodeling and removal of the nucleosome from the region . the nucleosomal coverage on pr <dig> at − <dig> position showed a conspicuous decline from − <dig>   to − <dig>  , reconfirming depletion of the nucleosome at the core promoter in sa-induced genes. since the results were validated at the stringency level of ≥ − <dig>  enrichment value by finding a nucleosome at the core promoter of the pr <dig> gene, it was subjectively decided to use the stringency of ≥ − <dig>  enrichment value for subsequent analysis.figure  <dig>

this stringency level was cross-validated by mapping the nucleosome occupancy over − <dig> to  <dig> bp region with respect to tss of alcohol dehydrogenase <dig> gene . this region of the gene has earlier been mapped  <cit>  and is shown to contain three nucleosomes in the promoter region , where one nucleosome is loosely positioned at − <dig> to − <dig> bp with a best fit at − <dig> bp and other two nucleosomes span − <dig> to − <dig> bp. the downstream region is also occupied by clear nucleosome ladders. a clear nucleosome ladder was found both downstream and upstream tss in the map generated by us, where the nucleosome occupied − <dig> to − <dig> bp region with respect to tss. the only minor observable difference was that a loosely positioned nucleosome reported at − <dig> to − <dig> bp position could not be interpreted clearly at the stringency level of ≥− <dig>  enrichment values in our data. however, if the stringency level is reduced from ≥− <dig>  to ≥− <dig>  in our data, even this nucleosome can also be identified. thus, our results are in good agreement with an already published nucleosome map of adh gene  <cit> , thereby justifying the ≥− <dig>  stringency criteria experimentally, to assign nucleosome positioning genome wide .

the chosen stringency level was subjected to further verification using qpcr analysis over four loci having a nucleosome under control conditions and four other loci lacking any nucleosome under control conditions. the results are concurrent with the interpretation made for each gene locus based on the tilling microarray experiments . thus, in our analysis, the presence of four continuous probes, consistently in three independent experiments, with enrichment value ≥− <dig>  marks a distinct nucleosome and likewise, the presence of more than four continuous probes marks a fuzzy nucleosome . our results show that fuzzy nucleosome signals are several folds higher than those of the distinct nucleosomes at the chosen stringency level. additional file  <dig> shows the number of bases that covered as distinct nucleosomes and the number of bases covered as fuzzy nucleosomal regions identified at the different stringency levels . the number of distinct and fuzzy nucleosomal regions obtained is almost consistent in all the chromosomes under both control and sa-treated conditions. the fuzzy nucleosomal regions were approximately four times higher than the distinct nucleosomes at the most stringent level  in terms of the number of nucleosomes  and more than ten-time higher at the least stringent level  in terms of the number of nucleosomes . at ≥− <dig>  stringency level, the fuzzy nucleosomal regions are 8- <dig> folds higher than the distinct nucleosomes in terms of the number of nucleosomes . below − <dig> , the fuzzy nucleosomal regions extend so much that the coverage by distinct nucleosome  decreases. this extension also affects the number of fuzzy nucleosomes negatively. while the overall coverage as fuzzy region increases, the number of fuzzy nucleosome decreases, indicating that the fuzzy regions eventually merge to increase their span. in conclusion, the table shows the gregariousness of data expected if stringency level below ≥− <dig>  were to be used for this study. the higher abundance of the fuzzy nucleosomal region can be partially attributed to the presence of more than one nucleosome that cannot be resolved by tiling microarray due to its limited resolution of 35 bp  <cit>  and partially, to the use of complete a. thaliana seedlings  for extracting mononucleosomes, thus interpreting only an average position of a nucleosome rather than the distinct nucleosome present in a specific cell lineage, as also observed in the case of caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> .

global nucleosomal coverage follows similar pattern across the genomes
the overall nucleosomal coverage obtained in our study is approximately 346 bp per nucleosome on all the chromosomes of a. thaliana . thus the number of nucleosomes per 1000 bp in our study is much less than the number of nucleosomes per 1000 bp with the nucleosomal coverage of 211 bp per nucleosome obtained by yuan et al. in yeast  <cit>  and 200 bp per nucleosome obtained by schones et al. in the human t <dig> cell line  <cit> . in addition, our study shows approximately 50% nucleosomal remodeling on sa treatment . this means that although the nucleosome coverage is approximately 42-44% under either of the two conditions and that approximately 56-58% region of the genome remains free under either condition,  <dig> % of the genome is the nor when both conditions are taken together. approximately 50% of this nor  either gains or loses the nucleosomes on sa treatment and hence is unique to each subset. remaining approximately 50% nor  is common to both conditions. further, the estimate of approximately 56-58% nfr may be an over estimation, considering the limitation of using genechip® arabidopsis tiling  <dig> r array, which covers not more than 88% of a. thaliana genome. further, the nucleosomal remodeling post sa treatment does not show any bias for a specific chromosome .

next, the nucleosomal coverage in non-coding regulatory regions, namely the promoter region, 5′utr, and 3′utr and the coding region was examined on each chromosome. the coding regions show a significantly higher nucleosomal percentage  than the regulatory region . these observations are consistent with earlier studies in the case of saccharomyces cerevisae, caenorhabditis elegans, and homo sapiens  <cit> , where lower nucleosomal occupancy in the regulatory region has been reported.

nucleosomal coverage was also compared in pericentromeric and centromeric regions along the five chromosomes in a. thaliana by plotting the nucleosomal coverage across the 10000 bp window . it was found that the nucleosomal coverage is consistently higher over entire chromosome  as compared with the centromere with <1000 bp coverage . the depleted nucleosomal coverage over the centromeric region is solely because of poor probe density over the region. there is approximately equal distribution of probes throughout the genome except over the centromeric and pericentromeric regions which have rather thin density of probes. additionally, the nucleosomal coverage is directly correlated to the probe density over both the centromeric and pericentromeric regions, except for chromosome  <dig> . these results agree with earlier reports in which the authors have found high content of nucleosome in pericentromeric heterochromatin regions arranged as a regularly spaced array  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
distribution of nucleosome coverage in the chromosomes. x axis  represents the  <dig> bases window size in chromosomes 1– <dig> respectively and y axis  represents the nucleosomal coverage in the window size of  <dig> bases.



genome-wide changes occur in nucleosome positioning in response to sa
to understand the genome-wide nucleosomal remodeling in response to sa in a. thaliana, global gene expression profiling was examined using a. thaliana ath <dig> chip  in conjunction to our nucleosomal mapping experiment. si, sr, con and sil groups were identified . average nucleosome coverage around the − <dig> to +1000 bp regions with respect to tss was examined in the genes of the groups specified earlier in a window of 50 bp. all the groups show considerably higher nucleosomal coverage in the coding region ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  as compared to the promoter region, where it ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .figure  <dig> 
nucleosomal occupancy is always depleted at transcription start site . coverage of - <dig> bp to + <dig> bp long region by nucleosome was done for different groups of genes . x-axis represents the positions with respect to tss  and y-axis represents average coverage of nucleosomal base in each figure. the numbers of genes taken in each group is given in parentheses. the − <dig> position is shown with arrow. bar below each figure shows the comparative statistical significance difference for each window.



another distinct feature commonly observed in all classes is the presence of a nucleosomal valley around the minimal promoter region within -200 bp upstream of tss . this is consistent with the previous findings in other studies  <cit> , where also the tss has been shown to be free of the nucleosome. in saccharomyces cerevisae, the authors have consistently found nfrs in the promoter region  <cit> . likewise, the promoters of actively expressing genes in homo sapiens also possess nucleosome-free tss flanked by positioned nucleosomes  <cit> . thus, the average low nucleosomal coverage at tss seems to be a ubiquitous property of all the genes across the genomes. in our study, the average coverage at this valley always remains below  <dig>   in all groups , except the sil group where it is above  <dig>  . for this group, the valley is considerably shallower than others, indicating a dense chromatin structure around the minimal promoter region. a possible reason accounting for this shallowness may be that since these genes are not expressed, they maintain the presence of nucleosomes at their minimal promoter region. it should be noted that the average nucleosomal occupancy at the − <dig> window also remains nearly insensitive to sa treatment in all groups.

to gain better insights about the correlation of nucleosomal remodeling in promoters with the sa-mediated response, specific change in nucleosomal remodeling  at the tss was ascertained in all these groups on sa treatment. for this, the total numbers of genes, showing nucleosomal occupancy under any condition, were retrieved and the percentage of the genes showing either nucleosomal depletion or enrichment on sa treatment around − <dig> to +1000 bp region with respect to tss was calculated. mapping of the cumulative data showed interesting patterns. it was found that the region downstream of tss show comparatively less remodeling in all the four groups . the con and sil groups show less nucleosomal remodeling even at the upstream region , where the percentage of genes undergoing nucleosomal depletion or enrichment increases only marginally near tss . the si and sr groups show a significant and mutually opposite pattern. the si and sr groups show nucleosomal depletion  and nucleosomal enrichment , respectively, at the complete promoter region as compared to con and sil groups, which are statistically significant at p-value ≤ <dig> . interestingly, the si group also shows minimum nucleosomal enrichment at tss , and the sr group shows minimum nucleosomal depletion at tss  on sa treatment. thus, the analysis establishes a correlation between the nucleosomal remodeling at proximal promoters and their expression on sa treatment.figure  <dig> 
salicylic acid  induced nucleosomal remodeling is more frequent in the sa responsive genes. the figure represents percentage of genes showing remodeled nucleosome out of total nucleosomes under any of the two conditions  in −1000 bp to +1000 bp long regions in all the four groups. x-axis represents the positions with respect to transcription start site  where − <dig> means − <dig> to − <dig>  y-axis represents percentage of genes having remodeled nucleosome at the particular position. below the graph is the statistical significance data for each position when compared for different groups as mentioned beside the map  at p-value ≤ <dig> .



to understand the reason behind distinct nucleosomal remodeling profiles of different groups, collective expression profile of these groups was obtained by annotating these groups on the basis of their functions. it is found that most of the con genes were significantly expressed in different metabolic pathways, while most of the sil genes were significantly expressed in reproductive and floral development pathways . this indicates that the sil genes, in general, may be involved in some specific pathways, thus allowing minimum disturbance at their promoter by this treatment. similarly, the si genes show significant involvement in sar pathway, sa mediated signaling pathways, ros pathway, response to hypoxia and other relevant pathways while sr genes showed involvement in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolic processes, photosynthesis etc.

nucleosome remodels at the promoter locus of pr1
the data analysis at the minimal promoter region of the pr <dig> gene shows the presence of a nucleosome upstream tss, on tata-box which is removed under sa-treated conditions . the absence of the pr <dig> core promoter nucleosome is depicted due to the mnase <dig> digestion strategy which preferentially digests the open chromatin in regions such as promoters of active genes  <cit> . transcriptional activation requires the assembly of pre-initiation complex  upstream tss, and the nucleosomal removal is sometimes required for active transcription  <cit> . in the past, studies have shown that the nucleosome is lost in the promoter region of pho <dig>  gene during transcription activation in yeast  <cit>  and in humans  <cit>  where it is hyperacetylated before being lost. similarly, interferon β-promoter is activated on nucleosome sliding by viral infection  <cit> . li et al. have also shown the same for the beta-phaseolin gene  <cit> . till date, the nucleosomal loss has been shown to accompany gene activation by either sliding of nucleosomes or eviction of nucleosomes.

this data analysis was validated by qpcr analysis using primers designed around the core promoter region at the pr <dig> locus using a mononucleosomal template . the analysis shows a 5- to 6-fold reduction in amplification in case of the sa-treated conditions as compared to the control sample. this indicates a loss of nucleosomal signal from the pr <dig> promoter locus . thus indeed, the qpcr results agree with the model deduced using tiling microarray at the stringency level of ≥− <dig>  .figure  <dig>

the nucleosomal repositioning in the 5′ regulatory region is found not only in pr1; rather, it is reproducible in other genes of the si group. the -1000 bp to 1000 bp region of all the si genes was mapped for the remodeling of nucleosomes  over the entire region on sa treatment. the data  show that while the tss remains largely depleted of nucleosomes even under uninduced conditions , about two-third of the remaining nucleosomes undergo remodeling on sa treatment , with only a few genes showing no change in the presence of the nucleosome around tss . thus, the results indicate that the nucleosome remodeling does not limit only to the pr <dig> gene but is applicable to the complete si group in a. thaliana.

npr <dig> plays distinct role in the nucleosomal remodeling around the core promoter region of the sa-regulated genes
the sar pathway is regulated by chromatin remodeling  <cit>  and works in both an npr1-dependent  and npr1-independent  manner downstream to sa induction. since pr <dig> is an nd gene, it was interesting to see whether the nucleosome depletion at the − <dig> window  in the si genes is affected by the presence of npr <dig>  thus, sa-regulated -nd and -ni genes were identified   <cit> . further, it was observed that ~80% of the sa-regulated genes used to study nucleosomal remodeling patterns  are also present in the list of sa-regulated genes selected by two-way anova . a list showing the functional go groups to which each gene significantly contribute was generated, when these genes were subjected to annotation followed by singular enrichment analysis under agrigo software . the analysis confirms the expression profile of each subset of the genes to their respective group; that is, while both groups are involved in the defense pathways; nd genes show significantly more involvement in defense pathways than the ni genes . each group is further divided into two: si and sr. interestingly, the examination of nucleosomal coverage in these subgroups in the − <dig> to +1000 bp regions with respect to tss in a window of 50 bp shows that the average nucleosomal coverage at − <dig> window does not change significantly under sa-treated condition as compared with the control condition in all four groups  . so, the graphs showing percentage of genes undergoing either nucleosomal depletion  or nucleosomal enrichment  on sa treatment were further plotted. statistically significant nucleosomal depletion just above the tss  in si-nd genes as compared with the si-ni genes was observed, which indeed, extends from  <dig> to − <dig> windows at p-value ≤ <dig>  . interestingly, significant nucleosome depletion in sr-nd genes around tss as compared to si-ni genes  was also observed at p-value ≤ <dig> ; however, not in comparison to sr-ni genes. similarly, statistically significant nucleosomal enrichment above the tss  in sr-nd genes as compared to the sr-ni genes was observed at p-value ≤ <dig> . no nucleosomal enrichment was observed in si-nd genes; rather, a significant decline in nucleosome enrichment in si-nd genes  was observed as compared to si-ni genes at p-value ≤ <dig> . thus, the results show that both the nucleosomal depletion in si-nd genes and the nucleosomal enrichment in sr-nd genes in response to sa induction correlate to the presence of npr <dig>  overall, it suggests a distinct role of npr <dig> in chromatin remodeling in sa-responsive genes in a. thaliana. however, the nucleosome depletion observed in sr-nd genes over si-ni genes does not seem to correlate to the presence of npr <dig> figure  <dig>

the result based on the role of npr <dig> in nucleosomal remodeling around the core promoter region has been further cross-validated. the nucleosomal occupancy at the core promoter and corresponding relative transcript abundance of three representative genes each from all the six categories under control and sa-treated conditions in two-week old seedlings of both wild-type  and npr1- <dig> mutant  has been checked. based on the normalization with the internal control genes set, each group shows average expression profile according to its class. our results show that the remodeling of the nucleosome at the promoter region in these different groups has characteristic differences . first, the con, sil, and sr-ni groups do not show any statistically significant change in nucleosomal occupancy at the minimal promoter in both wild-type and npr1- <dig> mutant under either control or sa-treated condition at p-value ≤  <dig>  . si-nd and si-ni genes show significant remodeling of the nucleosome at minimal promoter post sa treatment either in the presence or in the absence of npr <dig> at p-value ≤  <dig> ; however, sr-nd genes show significant remodeling of the nucleosome at minimal promoter post sa treatment only in the absence of npr <dig>  both sr-nd and sr-ni classes do not show any differences in the nucleosome occupancy at minimal promoter in col- <dig> post sa treatment. interestingly, in all the four sa-regulated classes , treatment of sa causes a statistically significant increase in nucleosomal occupancy over the minimal promoter loci in the absence of npr <dig> at p-value ≤ <dig> . npr <dig> has long been known to mediate the plant defense pathways through sa and ja cross-talk  <cit> . further, it is well understood that npr <dig> accumulates in the nucleus post sa treatment  <cit>  and associates with tga transcription factors to regulate sa-mediated transcription  <cit> . an increase in the nucleosome occupancy in sa-regulated genes in the absence of npr <dig>  indicates that npr <dig> has a general role in chromatin remodeling in all sa-regulated genes post sa treatment. however, exact role of npr <dig> in sa-mediated response is not clear from the present study and needs further investigation to augment our current understanding about the role of npr <dig> in the global nucleosomal remodeling in response to sa.figure  <dig>

abre elements and myb elements are enriched in nors of si genes, while w-box and tgacg/c motif are enriched in nfrs
next, some cis-regulatory motifs were identified in the remodeled nucleosomal region in the promoters  of  <dig> si genes  and annotated as per place database. these motifs include, at the top, motif  <dig>  similar to gt1gmscam <dig>  which interacts with gt- <dig> transcription factor to activate the pathogen- and salt-inducible gene scam- <dig> in glycine max  <cit> . motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are similar to different abre motifs  like abrece1hva <dig>  abareg <dig> element, abreosrab <dig>  proxbbnnapa and abrelaterd <dig>  respectively. motif  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are similar to myb family motifs like mybcoreatcycb <dig>  agmotifntmyb <dig> and mybplant  respectively . motif  <dig> is similar to ltrehvblt, a low temperature response element in the barley blt <dig>  promoter  <cit> . the preferred presence of these motifs cannot be attributed to the biasness caused by the use of mnase <dig>  as then it would not be found specifically in the si genes.figure  <dig>

promoters of the genes co-regulated with pr <dig> in the sar pathway have been reported to be highly enriched in w-box motif ttgac  <cit> , providing binding sites to wrky transcription factors. another pentameric motif tgacg/c, overlapping core w motif tgac, is not very common in pr <dig> regulon genes. however, both tga factors and wrky transcription factors are reported to regulate sa response by binding tgacg motif and w-box, respectively, in the pr <dig> promoter  <cit>  and globally  <cit> . therefore, it was interesting to identify the actual presence of both these motifs in context of nucleosomes. surprisingly, none of these motifs was observed as enriched in the remodeled region by meme . so, the presence of the w-box motif and tgagc/c motif was examined in the promoter region of all groups, namely, con, sil, si, sr, si-nd, sr-nd, si-ni, and sr-ni. both of the motifs were identified as enriched in the nfrs in the promoters of all the groups  invariably. only a very small fraction of w-box or tga motifs was present in either the nucleosomal or remodeled region. interestingly, enrichment of the tga motif was considerably higher in both nd and ni groups as compared to other groups . both motifs were significantly depleted in the sil group as compared with other groups , reflecting the functional significance of these motifs that are enriched in the active group. thus, it is concluded that both the w-box and tga motifs are significantly enriched in nfr. tga factors are involved in regulating basal expression of sar genes by either repressing the locus or promoting its basal expression  <cit> , and they physically interact with as 1-like elements for pr-1a gene regulation  <cit> . hence, the presence of w-box and tgacg motifs in nfr is interesting and needs to be validated regarding the affinity of wrky transcription factors and tga factors to bind their cognate sequence in nucleosomal and non-nucleosomal templates, respectively.

upstream activator region in the sr genes harbours many potential motifs involved in the plant defense pathway
the sr group shows characteristic nucleosomal remodeling by enrichment on sa treatment at an upstream region, that is, − <dig> to –800 bp upstream of tss . using lift and motif enrichment methods,  <dig> common motifs were found to be enriched in sr over the si group in the − <dig> to –800 bp promoter region, with enrichment fold change ≥ <dig> . on annotation of these motifs using place database, it was found that many of these are involved in the plant defense pathway. among such important motifs include three motifs similar to ls5atpr <dig>  one motif each similar to ls7atpr <dig>  as1likecshpra, tga1ntpr1a and pr2gcnt and two motifs similar to wboxntchn <dig> . ls <dig> and ls <dig> have been reported to provide binding sites to tga <dig> and tga <dig> respectively in a. thaliana  <cit> . tga1ntpr1a and as1likecshpra are reported as as1-like elements in tobacco and cucumber  <cit>  respectively. similarly, pr2gcnt and wboxntchn <dig> are reported to be present in stress- and developmentally-regulated pathogenesis-related acidic tobacco β- <dig> -glucanase gene  <cit>  and an ethylene inducible tobacco class <dig> chitinase <dig> gene  <cit>  respectively. three motifs each similar to agcboxnpglb and qarbnexta were also found, which were earlier reported in tobacco β- <dig> -glucanase gene enhancer element similar to gcc element required for ethylene regulated transcription of exta gene in b. napa in response to wounding and tensile stress  <cit> . many motifs similar to abre elements were found like abredistbbnnapa, abremotifiiiosrab16b, abremotifiosrab16b, abrece1hva <dig>  abre3hva <dig> and abretaem earlier identified in b. napa, rice, barley and wheat in relation to abscissic acid regulated transcription  <cit> . likewise, several motifs similar to myb <dig> binding elements were found — agmotifntmyb <dig>  myb26ps and mybpzm  which were linked to many defense associated pathways like phenylpropanoid pathway, flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, wound inducible pathway etc.  <cit> . two motifs similar to the sorlip2at element were also found in our analysis  <cit> . motifs similar to gare2osrep <dig>  garehvamy <dig>  ndegmsaur, auxrepsiaa <dig>  d4gmaux <dig>  drecrtcoreat and dre1corezmrab <dig> involved in other stress response pathways like auxin response pathway, gibberellic acid pathway and dehydration response pathway  <cit>  were also identified. the cross-talk between sa, ja, auxin, gibberellin, and aba has also been reported earlier to fine tune the plant stress responses  <cit> . our study also indicates that sa induction is responsible for chromatin remodeling over the cis-regulatory elements that are involved in both the sa-mediated response of sa-induced genes and the ja- and aba-mediated response of sa-repressed genes.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
perturbations change the transcriptional profile of an organism. these changes require both silencing and activation of certain genes and, thus, demand chromatin remodeling of such gene loci. in our study, conspicuous nucleosomal remodeling is found in the promoter region of salicylic acid regulated genes, where, under any of the two conditions, 40% of the chromatin is occupied by nucleosomes. the nucleosomal coverage is higher in 3′ coding regions as compared to the non-coding regions. likewise, the nucleosome coverage is higher over the entire chromosome except the centromeric region with marginally higher coverage in the pericentromeric regions. the nucleosomal remodeling at the promoter region in constitutive and silent groups remains insensitive to the salicylic acid treatment, whereas both salicylic acid induced and salicylic acid repressed groups show nucleosomal depletion and enrichment, respectively, on salicylic acid treatment. the nucleosomal depletion in the promoter region of the salicylic acid induced genes is a general feature of the group. a distinct role of non-expresser of pr <dig>  in salicylic acid regulated remodeling is observed. the salicylic acid induced-npr1dependent genes operate through nucleosomal depletion, and salicylic acid repressed-npr <dig> dependent genes operate through nucleosomal enrichment in response to salicylic acid induction in an npr1-dependent manner. all the four groups, that is, salicylic acid induced-npr <dig> dependent, salicylic acid repressed-npr <dig> dependent, salicylic acid induced-npr <dig> independent, and salicylic acid repressed-npr <dig> independent, show significant nucleosomal enrichment in the absence of npr <dig> on salicylic acid treatment.

the remodeled nucleosomal regions in salicylic acid induced groups harbour many important motifs that are known to be enriched in the genes involved in defense mechanisms such as abre elements, myb box etc. nevertheless, prominent motifs in the salicylic acid pathway, that is, w-box and tgacg/c, are enriched in nucleosome free regions of the promoter region. even the upstream region of salicylic acid repressed groups harbours many motifs that are involved in defense pathways.

overall, this study reports, for the first time, the genome-wide effects of salicylic acid treatment on the chromatin architecture of a. thaliana. it also interprets the enrichment of relevant motifs with respect to overall nucleosomal positioning in the promoter regions of salicylic acid regulated genes.
