BACKGROUND
the process of organ abscission allows plants to detach leaves, floral organs, fruit and seeds at specific points in their life cycles or in response to environmental cues. genetic analysis in arabidopsis has been particularly productive in revealing factors that activate the cell separation phase of floral organ abscission  <cit> , <cit> . less is known about the regulatory circuits that control abscission zone differentiation at the boundaries between the outer floral organs and underlying receptacle  <cit> , <cit> .

several genes that regulate lateral organ and/or inter-organ boundaries also affect floral organ abscission. the transcriptional activators blade-on-petiole <dig>  and bop <dig> redundantly control patterning of the proximal regions of developing leaves and floral organs  <cit> – <cit> . anatomical evidence of abscission zone differentiation cannot be detected in bop <dig> bop <dig> flowers and the sepals, petals and stamens remain strongly attached  <cit> . the bell-type homeodomain transcription factor, arabidopsis thaliana homeobox gene <dig> , represses growth in regions that will become the floral organ-receptacle boundaries and is required for stamen abscission zone formation  <cit> . hawaiian skirt , an f-box protein, prevents the fusion of adjacent sepals and influences the timing of their abscission  <cit> .

five mutant alleles of asymmetric leaves <dig> , a key determinant of polarity and cell fate in lateral organs  <cit> , were identified through a screen for floral organ shedding mutants  <cit>  . as <dig>  a myb transcription factor, acts in conjunction with the as <dig> lateral organ boundaries domain  transcription factor to repress expression of a set of meristem-promoting knotted1-like homeodomain  genes during leaf development  <cit> – <cit> . ectopic activity of the brevipedicellus , knat <dig> and knat <dig> homeodomain transcription factors has been genetically linked to the reduced size, shorter petioles and rumpled appearance of as <dig> mutant leaves  <cit> , <cit> . the as1-as <dig> repressor complex recruits components of the polycomb-repressive complex <dig> to the promoters of bp and knat <dig>  to establish an inactive chromatin state in leaf cells  <cit> – <cit> .

as <dig> also restricts expression of bp and knat <dig> within developing flower primordia  <cit> . bp is expressed in the pedicel, receptacle, and organ boundaries of wild-type flowers, while knat <dig> is primarily restricted to the floral organ boundaries and receptacle  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . in as <dig> mutant flowers, which open prematurely due to their smaller sepals and petals, expression of bp and knat <dig> expands into the sepals  <cit> , <cit> . genetic analysis has shown that the combined loss of bp, knat <dig> and knat <dig> activity is sufficient to rescue the reduced organ size and open bud defects of as <dig> mutant flowers  <cit> .

bp directs growth of the receptacle, an expanded region of the pedicel  <cit> . bp flowers have slender, abbreviated pedicels due to radial constriction of the receptacle and reduced cell division  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . due to increased constriction on the abaxial side of the pedicel, bp pedicels bend down rather than pointing up  <cit> . bp also functions during floral organ abscission to prevent premature shedding and inhibit expansion of abscission zone cells  <cit> , <cit> . the abscission zones of bp flowers are notably enlarged, similar to those of flowers with constitutive expression of inflorescence deficient in abscission   <cit> . signaling by the ida peptide through the haesa  and haesa-like <dig> receptor-like kinases has been proposed to activate organ abscission by inhibiting bp activity  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> .

here we show that as <dig> controls the placement of the sepal and petal organ abscission zones in arabidopsis flowers. the medial sepals of as <dig> mutant flowers are most affected: delayed organ abscission occurs along the edges of a triangular-shaped proximal domain with altered identity. we further show that loss of bp activity is sufficient to rescue the abscission-related defects of as <dig> mutant flowers.

methods
plants
five as <dig>  mutants were previously identified through a genetic screen for organ shedding mutants  <cit>  ; all mutants are of the landsberg erecta  ecotype. the f <dig> progeny of a cross between the as1- <dig> and as1- <dig> mutants showed abscission defects, consistent with an allelic relationship between the mutations. as1- <dig>  and bp- <dig>  seeds were obtained from abrc . plants homozygous for as1- <dig> were distinguished with a caps   <cit>  marker based on a bcci site present in the wild-type allele of as <dig>  the oligos used to amplify this region of the as <dig> gene are described in additional file 2: table s <dig>  plants were grown at 21°c with 50% humidity and a 16 hour photoperiod.

microscopy and marker analyses
wild-type and mutant flowers were fixed as previously described  <cit> , and prepared for scanning electron microscopy using a tousimis samdri- <dig> critical point dryer  and ems  <dig> sputter coater equipped with a film thickness monitor . samples were examined using an accelerating voltage of 10 kv in a fei xl- <dig> scanning electron microscope . young flowers  were dissected and reimaged to determine their developmental stage  <cit> .

a transgenic hae::gus line  <cit>  was crossed to the as1- <dig> and as1-20 bp- <dig> mutants to generate single and double mutants carrying this abscission zone marker. for β-glucuronidase assays, wild-type and mutant flowers were fixed and stained as described  <cit>  with minor modifications. digital images were taken with a stemi sv <dig> dissecting microscope and axiocam hr camera  or powershot sx <dig> is . image brightness and contrast were adjusted with photoshop cs <dig> . abscission zone displacement was measured using nih imagej  <cit> .

molecular biology
genomic dna samples were prepared from wildtype  and two independent as1- <dig> mutant plants using the dneasy plant mini kit . regions of the as <dig> gene were pcr amplified as described in additional file 2: table s <dig>  pcr products were purified using the zymoclean gel dna recovery kit  and sequenced . sequences were analyzed using geneious r <dig>  software .

RESULTS
identification of a new mutation in the as <dig> myb domain
as <dig> is one of  <dig> proteins in arabidopsis with a myb domain composed of r <dig> and r <dig> repeats  <cit> , <cit> . each repeat consists of three helices, of which the second and third form a helix-turn-helix motif that binds dna . to characterize the role of as <dig> in organ abscission, we selected as1- <dig>   <cit>  and as1- <dig> <cit> , <cit> , <cit>  as reference alleles . the associated nonsense mutation for as1- <dig> is in the third helix of the as <dig> r <dig> repeat   <cit> . the as1- <dig> mutant , was found to introduce a nonsense mutation in the first helix of the as <dig> r <dig> repeat .

the as1- <dig> mutation disrupts a salt bridge in the dna binding domain
within each repeat of eukaryotic r2r <dig> myb proteins, an acidic amino acid residue in the first helix forms a salt bridge with a basic amino acid residue in the turn adjacent to the third helix  <cit>  . the glutamic acid and arginine residues that form salt bridges in r2r <dig> myb proteins are conserved in more than 97% of the arabidopsis family members surveyed  <cit>  . of the as <dig> alleles that introduce point mutations  <cit> , <cit> , as1- <dig>   <cit>  represents the only missense mutation identified to date. replacement of the affected glutamic acid with lysine, a basic residue, would prevent salt bridge formation in the r <dig> repeat of the as1- <dig> mutant protein . an alanine substitution of the corresponding glutamic acid within the r <dig> repeat of the c-myb transcription factor abolishes both dna binding and transcriptional activation  <cit> .

mutations in as <dig> delay shedding of the medial sepals
arabidopsis flowers contain pairs of medial and lateral sepals, four petals and six stamens, which are shed shortly after fertilization    <cit> . in each of the as <dig> mutants known to alter organ abscission , shedding of the medial sepals is delayed until after the fruit is fully elongated . when as <dig> flowers are touched during the normal period of abscission , the medial sepals remain firmly attached. of  <dig> as1- <dig> flowers  surveyed after touching, 80%  of the medial sepals remained attached compared to 0%  for  <dig> wild-type flowers. abscission of the lateral sepals is also delayed in some as1- <dig>  as1- <dig> and as1- <dig> flowers .

the sepal and petal abscission zones of as <dig> flowers are displaced
after abscission , the positions of the floral organ abscission zones can be easily visualized in wild-type flowers . discrete domains of the abscission zone cells that remain with the plant body are present for the petals and stamens, along with a band of sepal abscission zone cells that encircles the receptacle. placement of the sepal abscission zones is altered in as <dig> flowers . instead of developing at the sepal base, abscission zones are usually formed in an inverted v-shape within the proximal regions of as <dig> medial and lateral sepals . when the sepals are shed, triangular regions of tissue remain attached at the bases of as <dig> flowers . displacement of the medial sepal abscission zones  is more pronounced relative to that of the lateral sepal abscission zones . the distalmost position of as1- <dig> medial abscission zones is 279 ± 15 μm  from the sepal base, compared to 133 ± 13 μm  for as1- <dig> lateral abscission zones. in as1- <dig> flowers, the medial sepal abscission zones were displaced 268 ± 34 μm  compared to 107 ± 11 μm  for the lateral abscission zones.

the positions of the petal abscission zones are also shifted in as <dig> flowers . after abscission, the tissue stubs that remain at the petal attachment sites are 126 ± 18 μm  for as1- <dig> flowers and 92 ± 8 μm  for as1- <dig> flowers. while placement of the lateral stamen abscission zones appears to be unaffected in as <dig> flowers , small tissue projections are sometimes observed at the attachment sites for the medial stamens .

the proximal regions of as <dig> medial sepals show an altered identity
the outer organs of wild-type flowers begin to wither and senesce shortly before abscission , but are still turgid when they detach  <cit> . in as <dig> flowers , due to the delay in abscission of the medial sepals, two distinctive patterns of chlorophyll loss are observed after the extended senescence period . the primary pattern is that chlorophyll is retained in a triangular-shaped proximal zone and lost elsewhere in as <dig> medial sepals . larger proximal-distal green zones are also observed in some as <dig> medial sepals . of  <dig> as1- <dig> medial sepals surveyed,  <dig>  had green proximal zones with a triangular shape . the other  <dig>  had green proximal-distal zones with an hourglass shape . if the neck of the altered proximal-distal zone is narrow, only the triangular-shaped proximal region remains attached after abscission . if it is wide, the sides of the medial sepal begin to abscise, starting from the proximal edges .

establishment of the medial sepal-receptacle boundary is altered in as <dig> flowers
in wild-type flowers, a crease marking the future sepal-receptacle boundary is apparent at the bases of the sepal primordia by stage  <dig> . as development continues , constriction of growth in this region compared to the cells found in the sepal primordia above and floral receptacle below  results in the formation of a clearly defined boundary   <cit> , <cit> . in as <dig> mutant flowers , the position of the initial crease is distally displaced at the midpoints of the medial sepal primordia . although some growth suppression is evident , the medial sepal-receptacle boundary regions of as <dig> flowers  are disorganized and less pronounced than those of wild-type . as as <dig> flowers mature , the slight displacement of this boundary in the medial sepals can still be detected  compared to wild-type . the lateral sepal-receptacle boundary regions of as <dig> flowers  resemble those of wild-type flowers .

whereas wild-type sepal primordia are rounded , the central-proximal domains of as <dig> medial sepal primordia become ridged . trichomes are frequently present in these regions of as <dig> sepals , and are not observed in the corresponding areas of wild-type sepals . the altered appearance of the proximal domains of as <dig> medial sepals corresponds with the regions that retain chlorophyll as the rest of the sepal senesces . abscission occurs along the distal edges of these proximal zones  rather than coinciding with the regions where growth is constricted at their bases .

the abscission zone defects of as <dig> flowers are bp-dependent
to determine whether bp activity contributes to the displaced abscission zones of as <dig> flowers, we generated the as1-20 bp- <dig> double mutant. bp- <dig> is a null allele due to a deletion that spans the entire locus  <cit> , <cit> . as previously reported for the as1-1 bp- <dig> double mutant  <cit> , the overall appearance of the as1-20 bp- <dig> inflorescences is largely additive with respect to those of the single mutants. like the bp- <dig> mutant   <cit> , as1-20 bp- <dig> mutant inflorescences have abbreviated internodes and slender, short, downward-pointing pedicels . as in the as1- <dig> mutant , the reduced size of the sepals and petals of as1-20 bp- <dig> flowers results in premature bud opening and exposure of the developing stamens and carpels .

loss of bp activity is, however, sufficient to restore the positions of the sepal and petal abscission zones in as <dig> flowers  as well as the timing of medial sepal abscission . as in wild-type flowers, distinct abscission zones are initially observed in as <dig> bp flowers after organ shedding . as fruit maturation progresses , the sepal abscission zones of as <dig> bp flowers become enlarged and have a disorganized appearance . this result is consistent with the abscission zone enlargement that is characteristic of bp flowers  <cit> , <cit> .

in younger as <dig> bp and bp flowers , the positions of the sepal-receptacle boundaries are not distally displaced  as they are in as <dig> flowers . in addition, the central-proximal regions of as <dig> bp medial sepals are not ridged, nor do they contain ectopic trichomes . these results suggest that the altered identity of the proximal zone and the shifted sepal-pedicel boundary in as <dig> flowers are also bp-dependent.

due to radial constriction of the receptacle, the creases at the bases of bp and as <dig> bp sepal primordia  are notably less distinct  than those of wild-type flowers . by promoting expansion of the receptacle in wild-type flowers, bp activity influences the definition of the sepal-pedicel boundary.

expression of the hae::gus abscission zone marker is altered in as <dig> flowers
we have presented morphological evidence that the placement of sepal and petal abscission zones is shifted in as <dig> mutant flowers . to examine the profile of a known marker of floral organ abscission zones in as <dig> flowers, we crossed the as1- <dig> mutant to a transgenic plant carrying a fusion of the hae promoter to the β-glucuronidase  reporter gene  <cit> , <cit> . in wild-type hae::gus flowers , expression of gus persists in the remaining floral organ abscission zone cells in discrete domains that mark the sepal, petal and stamen attachment sites . in as1- <dig> flowers , hae regulatory regions usually direct gus expression in an inverted v-shape in the proximal zone of the medial sepals . like the delayed progression of cell separation , expression of this marker originates at the proximal edges of as1- <dig> medial sepals  and usually expands distally until the lines intersect at the sepal midpoint . gus expression is also found in the tissue remnants that remain at the petal and lateral sepal attachment sites of as1- <dig> flowers .

we have shown that loss of bp activity is sufficient to restore the positions of the sepal and petal abscission zones in as1- <dig> flowers. to determine whether the expression profile of the hae::gus abscission zone marker is also rescued in as1-20 bp- <dig> flowers, mutants carrying this marker were generated. we discovered that, as in wild-type flowers , gus is expressed in the remaining sepal and petal abscission zone cells at the bases of as1-20 bp- <dig>  as well as bp- <dig>  flowers . interestingly, the band of gus expression corresponding to the sepal abscission zone cells is conspicuously wider and diffuses into the distal pedicel of both as1-20 bp- <dig>  and bp- <dig> flowers , in correspondence with the enlarged abscission zones of these mutant flowers.

taken together, these results provide molecular evidence that sepal and petal abscission zones are distally displaced in as <dig> flowers, and that this displacement is bp-dependent.

discussion
we report here a novel role for the as <dig> myb transcription factor in establishing the positions of the sepal and petal abscission zones. three aspects of the altered pattern of sepal abscission in as <dig> flowers are noteworthy. first, maximal abscission zone displacement occurs at the midpoint of each as <dig> sepal . second, the abscission zone midpoints of the medial sepals are shifted distally about twice as far as those of the lateral sepals . third, expression of the hae::gus abscission zone marker is not only displaced but shows a late onset in as <dig> medial sepals , which is mirrored by a significant delay in abscission . these results suggest that the loss of as <dig> activity primarily affects the position of abscission zone cell specification, and that the degree of displacement is influenced by orientation with respect to the inter-sepal boundary regions as well as the medial-lateral axis of the flower . the delay in detachment of as <dig> medial sepals may represent an alteration in either the timing of abscission zone specification or of the subsequent activation of cell separation.

our analysis of as <dig> flowers reveals that proximal zones within the medial sepals have an altered identity. as the attached organs senesce , a distinct demarcation appears between proximal regions that remain green and the rest of the organ that loses its color as chlorophyll is catabolized . trichomes are frequently observed in the central, ridged proximal zones of as <dig> medial sepals  and are not found within the corresponding rounded areas of wild-type sepals . the displaced abscission zones of as <dig> medial sepals outline the distal edges of these altered proximal zones . the region of constricted growth that defines the medial sepal-receptacle boundary of wild-type flowers  <cit> , <cit>  is disorganized and slightly shifted at the bases of as <dig> medial sepals . it is intriguing that the growth suppression associated with this boundary can be uncoupled from abscission zone differentiation in as <dig> flowers. these results suggest that the sepal-receptacle boundary is disrupted in as <dig> flowers but not completely dismantled.

displacement of the sepal and petal abscission zones in as <dig> flowers is bp-dependent . in wild-type flowers, the as1-as <dig> repressor complex restricts the bp expression domain to the pedicel, receptacle and organ boundary regions of the floral organ primordia  <cit> . although the combined loss of bp, knat <dig> and knat <dig> activity is required to restore normal sepal and petal size in as <dig> flowers  <cit> , loss of bp alone is sufficient to rescue the shifted position of the sepal-receptacle boundary and the altered features of the proximal zone associated with the displaced abscission zones of as <dig> medial sepals .

an interesting parallel to our results is the as1-mediated regulation of bp expression during fruit patterning. arabidopsis fruit are composed of two carpel valves attached to a medial replum  <cit> . seed dispersal is facilitated by dehiscence zones that form at the valve-replum boundaries  <cit> . within the developing gynoecium, as <dig> restricts expression of a bp::gus marker to the region that will become the replum  <cit> . compared to wild-type fruit, as <dig> mutant fruit contain a wider replum and narrower valves, and show expansion of the replum domain of bp expression as well as ectopic expression of bp in the valves  <cit> . loss of bp activity was found to partially restore the respective sizes of the repla and valves in as <dig> bp fruit  <cit> . through its regulation of the valve-replum boundary, as <dig> controls the position of the fruit dehiscence zones. in as <dig> fruit, the dehiscence zones are shifted laterally due to expansion of the replum  <cit> . we propose that as <dig> similarly regulates placement of the floral organ-receptacle boundaries and thereby the positions of the sepal and petal organ abscission zones.

bp plays dual roles in regulating organ abscission. in addition to influencing the specification sites of abscission zone cells, bp prevents premature abscission by inhibiting the cell separation phase of abscission  <cit> . signaling through the ida-hae/hsl <dig> pathway has been proposed to relieve the bp-mediated repression of organ abscission  <cit> . bp and as <dig> bp flowers develop enlarged, disorganized sepal abscission zones  that resemble those of flowers constitutively expressing ida  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . we have found that expression of a hae::gus marker expands into the receptacles of bp and as <dig> bp flowers . these results suggest that bp may control sepal abscission zone size by restricting hae expression from the receptacle.

our study provides fresh evidence to support the links between organ boundary formation and abscission zone development. unlike ath <dig> and bop1/bop <dig>  which are required for some or all of the floral organ abscission zones to form  <cit> , <cit> , as <dig> and bp appear to play a more indirect role in abscission zone specification by regulating their positions. our observation that displacement of the sepal abscission zones in as <dig> flowers is less affected at the sepal margins than at the sepal midpoint  suggests that factors active at the inter-sepal boundaries also influence abscission zone differentiation. the growth suppression that occurs at inter-organ boundaries has been previously found to affect the establishment of lateral organ boundaries. flowers with mutations in the cup-shaped cotyledon <dig>  and cuc <dig> genes have fused sepals, but their sepal-receptacle boundaries are not altered  <cit> . however, reduction of cuc activity further obscures the definition of the sepal-receptacle boundaries of ath <dig> flowers  <cit> . further dissection of the complex regulatory networks that establish lateral and inter-organ boundaries is expected to uncover critical connections between the definition and positioning of the receptacle boundary, proximal-distal organ patterning, and floral organ abscission zone development.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a novel role for as <dig> in establishing the positions of the sepal and petal abscission zones. in as <dig> mutant flowers, the sepal and petal abscission zones are displaced distally, detachment of the medial sepals is significantly delayed, and proximal domains within the medial sepals show an altered identity. loss of bp activity rescues the abscission zone and proximal domain defects of as <dig> flowers. our results suggest that further advances in understanding the process of floral organ abscission zone development can be made by analyzing the network of genes known to control organ boundaries and proximal-distal patterning in arabidopsis leaves.
