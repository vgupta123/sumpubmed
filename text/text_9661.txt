BACKGROUND
brassica rapa  is an important crop that consists of diverse morphotypes , including oilseed , leafy vegetables , turnip  and broccoletto. it contributes the a-genome to the amphidiploid oil crop canola . yellow sarson and brown sarson are grown for oil production in the indian sub-continent, and in canada, because of their early maturity and shatter resistance. brassica seed is important for both plant propagation and oil production.

brassica seed is non-endospermic, which means that the endosperm is not retained in mature seeds and only the embryo is enclosed by the seed coat  <cit> . seed development goes through basically three overlapping stages: morphogenesis, seed filling and seed desiccation  <cit> . embryo development, also known as embryogenesis, starts after the double fertilization process of fusion of two sperm nuclei with the egg cell and the central cell nuclei, respectively, and the zygote goes through a series of cell divisions and differentiation events from a pre-globular and globular embryo stage, a heart stage, a torpedo stage, a bent-cotyledon stage to the mature embryo  <cit> . embryogenesis consists of two phases; morphogenesis and seed filling, as the seeds are non-endospermic.

seed development goes through a complex network of many dynamic developmental, biochemical and metabolic processes such as cell division and differentiation, carbohydrate, protein, cell wall, lipid, amino acid, hormone and secondary metabolite biosynthesis  <cit> . several hundreds of genes are reported to be involved in spatial and temporal regulation of these metabolic processes. a systematic overview of metabolic processes and gene expression patterns during seed development has been well documented for the closely related model plant arabidopsis thaliana. in b. napus, transcript profiling was mainly reported in relation to oil biosynthesis and storage seed reserves  <cit> . for oil biosynthesis, starch is synthesized at the early seed developmental stage, but after intermediate processes such as malonyl-coa and fatty acid biosynthesis, converted into triacylglycerol , lipids and storage proteins during the seed-filling phase at a later stage of seed development in both a. thaliana and b. napus <cit> . a starchless mutant contained up to 40% less lipids in mature arabidopsis seed than the wild-type, while starch was undetectable  <cit> . starch turnover, breakdown of cytosolic and plastidic glycolytic pathways, malonyl-coa and fatty acid  synthesis, tag assembly and oil body formation takes place during tag synthesis in seed  <cit> . the plant hormones gibberellin, auxin, ethylene and abscisic acid  play key regulatory roles in seed development and growth  <cit>  and changes in hormonal levels affect the seed size and seed number in b. napus, especially during the 10–20 days after pollination  period  <cit> . transcription factors, for example, abi <dig> , abi <dig>  abi <dig>  lec <dig> , lec <dig> and fus <dig>  are important regulators of the complex gene network during the process of seed development, maturation and germination  <cit> .

understanding the regulatory mechanisms of seed development is essential to identify the molecular basis of seed development. transcript profiling of developing seeds has been a widely used strategy to identify functional genes and their regulatory elements for seed development that can be used as tools in breeding programs for seed quality traits. transcriptomics provides a powerful tool and is widely used to examine the temporal and spatial changes in transcript abundance during seed development in arabidopsis <cit> , b. napus <cit> , wheat  <cit> , maize  <cit> , barley  <cit> , rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , jatropha <cit>  and many other crops. so far, we are not aware of any studies connecting global gene expression profiles to seed developmental stages in the diploid brassica species b. rapa. the release of the whole-genome sequence of b. rapa morphotype chinese cabbage var. chiifu  <cit>  facilitates genomic studies, such as gene expression analysis and genetical genomics studies  <cit> . the knowledge on changes in gene expression associated with specific stages of seed development is crucial to unravel the molecular and biochemical events that influence optimal seed metabolite composition  <cit> . timing of major transition stages differs between metabolic pathways  and also between species. the higher number of differentially expressed sequence tags  at  <dig> dap than at  <dig> dap in b. napus suggest that most developmental changes take place at 10– <dig> dap  <cit> . major changes in gene expression profiles of genes involved in protein translation, starch metabolism and hormonal regulation were reported between 17– <dig> dap in b. napus, whereas fatty acid synthesis related genes were highly expressed at  <dig> dap as compared to earlier and later time points  <cit> . in developing b. napus spring cultivar seeds,  <dig> dap was the most active stage to measure variation in transcript abundance of genes related to the biosynthesis of starch, lipids, carotenoids, isoprenoids, proteins and storage reserves  <cit> .

recently, genetical genomics has become a powerful tool to find candidate genes for complex traits  <cit> , such as seed quality and seedling vigour traits  <cit> . in this approach variation in transcript abundance is considered as quantitative traits in quantitative trait loci  analyses per gene, resulting in identification of genomic regions regulating gene expression . it is important to find an optimum stage during seed development for eqtl mapping studies, where large numbers of genes show differences in transcript abundance between genotypes in a segregating population. to obtain a comprehensive insight into transcriptional changes during seed development in b. rapa, we carried out morphological characterization and global transcriptome analysis in a time range of developing seeds of a black/brown-seeded pak choi vegetable-type , a yellow-seeded oil-type yellow sarson  and both a yellow and a black/brown-seeded doubled haploid  progeny line from their cross. in this study, we first describe embryo and seed morphological changes in time. second, the differential expression profiles of genes from different metabolic pathways and transcription factors in developing seeds of the four genotypes are presented. third, a window around the optimum seed development stage was defined based on genotypic and developmental transcriptomic profiles for more extended gene expression studies. fourth, we investigated the regulation of lipid metabolism in more detail. using a comparative analysis of gene expression networks among these four different genotypes, we explore the differential gene expression profiles and conserved regulatory mechanisms for seed development across these morphotypes of the diploid crop species b. rapa.

RESULTS
morphology of developing seeds and embryos
morphological changes in developing embryos and seeds were monitored from  <dig> dap until  <dig> dap. the images show that seed and embryo structure were visible at  <dig> and  <dig> dap, respectively . the colour of the embryo in ys <dig> was green already at  <dig> dap  and changed from green to yellow at  <dig> dap, while in pc <dig> the embryo turned green only around  <dig> dap  and changed from green to yellow at  <dig> dap  . in the case of the seed coat, the colour gradually turned from pale yellow to greenish or green until  <dig> dap, then turned to brown or black in pak choi; however, for ys <dig> the seed coat colour changed from green to yellow from  <dig> dap . different embryo developmental stages could be defined in time, such as: pre-globular, globular, heart shape , torpedo , bent-cotyledon , embryo filling seed completely  .figure  <dig>

. developing seeds represent different developmental stages after fertilization to seed maturity. seed developmental stages are: s0: fertilization; s1: pre-globular; s2: globular; s3: heart; s4: torpedo; s5: linear cotyledon; s6: bent-cotyledon; s7: embryo fully fills seed.



real-time gene expression profiling in developing seeds
the transcript abundance of  <dig> selected genes from a few key metabolic processes and transcription factors  was measured from  <dig> to  <dig> dap to obtain an overview of gene expression patterns during seed development. three patterns were observed, with peak levels at 10– <dig> dap, 25– <dig> dap and 35– <dig> dap which are defined as early-, mid- and later- stage, respectively . these patterns were not very different among the four genotypes tested. out of the ten genes, transcription factors lec <dig> and glabra <dig> and the starch gene gbssi were expressed higher during earlier stages, lipid metabolism genes dgat <dig> and fae <dig>  and storage protein 12s-cra <dig> were expressed higher at mid stages, while the lipid metabolism gene dgat <dig> , carbohydrate metabolism gene sus <dig>  and the storage protein lea and chd3-chromatine-remodeling factor pickle were expressed highest at late stages. for the whole genome microarray gene expression profiling, six time points were selected:   <dig> dap ,   <dig> dap ,   <dig> dap , and the developmental stages where the embryo fully fills the seed, being   <dig> dap   <dig> dap and   <dig> dap. these time points captured transcriptional changes at early, mid and late stages of seed development.

microarray hybridization and probe annotation
in a dedicated b. rapa agilent array,  <dig>  probes  represent  <dig>  brassica rapa gene id . out of  <dig>  bra ids,  <dig>  bra ids  were assigned to  <dig> mapman functional annotation categories. the remaining  <dig>   bra ids were not assigned to any functional category .

pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify how similar transcript abundance was between time-points and also between four replicates in each genotype . all the replicates of each genotype from each time point had high correlations  in all four genotypes . the correlation coefficients between time points decrease as the time points increase. pearson correlation coefficients of transcript abundance between time-points were high  from  <dig> to  <dig> dap in pc <dig>  and from  <dig> to  <dig> dap in ys <dig>  dh <dig> and dh <dig>  but after those time points a transition from high  to lower  correlation coefficients occurs between early and later time points.

correlation of transcript abundance of genes from real-time pcr and microarray analysis
since transcript abundance was measured using two different techniques: qrt-pcr and microarray that might lead to a non-linear relationship, spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, which are free from parametric assumptions, were used to compare the outcome of these two techniques. the transcript abundance from qrt-pcr and microarray of  <dig> selected genes were significantly and positively correlated except for transcription factors lec <dig> and chd3-chromatine-remodeling factor pickle. the rank correlation coefficients ranged from  <dig>  for dgat <dig> to  <dig>  for lea protein .

genome-wide variation in transcript abundance during seed development
principal components analysis  on transcript abundance of the  <dig>  probes showed a sequential distribution of the six time points according to seed developmental stages along the first principal component  and separation of the four b. rapa genotypes along pc <dig>  pc <dig> explained  <dig> % of total variation, and is associated mostly with variation in transcript abundance over the developmental stages, where  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap form a tight group, with  <dig> dap more loosely grouped with these earlier stages. similarly,  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap were grouped together  except in pc <dig>  major changes in transcript abundance were observed between  <dig> and  <dig> dap , which coincides with the period of transition from bent-cotyledon to the stage when the embryo fully fills the seed. pc <dig> explained  <dig> % of the total variation, and reflects mostly genotypic differences. interestingly, the two dh lines were grouped in between the two parental genotypes .figure  <dig>

we investigated the loading values of probes on pc <dig>  where probes with very low negative loadings were associated with the early stage of seed development  while the probes with very high positive loading were in response to later stages  . among  <dig> mapman functional categories, probes with high positive or low negative loadings mainly belong to metabolic pathways such as photosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, protein metabolism, signalling, rna , stress, transport, developmental processes, hormone metabolism, phosphate metabolism and secondary metabolism .

apparent changes in numbers of selected probes in contrasts between developmental stages or genotypes lead to selection of metabolic pathways
after excluding probes with rather constant transcript levels  across seed development and between genotypes,  <dig>  probes  were retained for further analysis . based on either a high number of selected probes per pathway or apparent changes in the number of selected probes from contrasts between consecutive time points or between genotypes at each time point, the top thirteen metabolic pathways were emphasized in this study. these top thirteen metabolic pathways correspond to metabolic pathways highlighted based on higher pc <dig> and pc <dig> loadings in pca analysis. those top thirteen metabolic pathways are represented by  <dig> probes  and used for network analysis to separate the gene clusters according to temporal  and/or genotypic variation  during seed development .

signed weighted gene co-expression network analysis  identifies gene modules associated with temporal and or genotype effects
signed wgcna grouped the selected probes  into  <dig> co-expression gene modules, each one containing probes with a similar transcript abundance across genotypes and seed developmental stages. in an analysis of variance  test,  <dig> gene modules  showed a genotype effect,  <dig> modules  a time effect, and  <dig> modules  a genotype as well as a time effect at  <dig>  significance level and the remaining  <dig> gene modules did not show any effect . since some of the gene modules showed similar expression patterns with subtle differences, gene modules were combined according to the time or genotype or time and genotype effects, and subjected to hierarchical clustering to have a broader overview of the patterns of transcript abundance.

temporal variation across seed development stages
using hierarchical clustering,  <dig> probes from the four gene modules  were classified into three clusters . cluster i  represents genes with higher transcript levels at earlier stages  from linear cotyledon to bent-cotyledon. both cluster ii  and cluster iii  show increased transcript abundance in time, from  <dig> dap for cluster ii and from later stages after the embryo fills the seed at  <dig> dap for cluster iii .figure  <dig>

genes associated with photosynthesis , fatty acid  synthesis, fa elongation and lipid degradation are over-represented only in cluster i, so, these genes are active early in seed development and down-regulated later . also genes from tocopherol biosynthesis, mevalonate and carotenoids in secondary metabolism, as well as from biosynthesis of serine, glycine, cysteine, glutamate, aspartate and alanine amino acids were only over-represented in cluster i. transcription factors  were mostly under-represented in this cluster i. for example, ap2/erebp, bhlh, c2h <dig>  myb, and wrky tfs were under-represented in cluster i, and bzip was overrepresented in cluster ii. genes involved in cell wall metabolism including precursor synthesis, cellulose synthesis, cell wall proteins and cell wall degradation, and genes in triacylglycerol synthesis  and fa desaturation were mainly over-represented in cluster ii, which means that they continuously increase in abundance from  <dig> dap till  <dig> dap. also, storage protein genes and genes related to the biosynthesis of auxin, brassinosteroid and gibberellin and branched-chain and aromatic amino acids  were over-represented only in this cluster ii. similarly, metabolite transporter genes and major intrinsic protein genes from transport metabolism were mainly over-represented in both clusters i and ii, but receptor kinases and g-proteins genes from signaling pathway, and genes involved in protein synthesis, protein posttranslational modification, protein degradation, rna processing and rna binding were under-represented in cluster i and or ii. genes related to cytochrome p <dig> and seed storage  of phosphate metabolism, late embryogenesis abundant  proteins, and ethylene and abscisic acid from hormonal metabolism were over-represented in cluster ii and or iii, so their abundance increased during seed development. biotic stress tolerance genes related to pr-proteins were underrepresented in cluster ii and iii but genes related to heat shock proteins for abiotic stress tolerance were overrepresented in cluster iii. interestingly, cluster ii and iii had high transcript abundance during late stages of seed development with different patterns.figure  <dig>

putative cis-regulatory elements underlying co-expressed genes of lipid metabolism
we looked in more detail to changes in transcript abundance related to lipid metabolism because oil is the major storage compound of brassica seeds. b. rapa and b. napus are widely grown for oil production, while b. rapa is also grown as vegetable crop. therefore, it is interesting to know the variation in transcript abundance of genes related to oil biosynthesis during seed development in oil-type and non-oil type morphotypes. for this study, two genotypes: a yellow-seeded oil-type genotype ys <dig> and a black/brown-seeded vegetable-type genotype pc <dig> were chosen. in addition, two dh progeny lines, a yellow-seeded and a black/brown-seeded line, resembling the two parental lines were also used to develop ideas on segregation of transcript abundance of oil biosynthesis genes. in additional file 11: figure s <dig>  the pathway for oil biosynthesis is depicted, with acetyl-coa as the main precursor for the synthesis of fatty acids , triacylglycerol  and phospholipids. transcript abundance was visualized separately for genes involved in fa synthesis, fa elongation, lipid degradation, fa desaturation, biosynthesis of tag and phospholipids, and oleosin .

in the process of fa synthesis and elongation, transcript abundance of genes revealed patterns with either a clear temporal effect or with a clear genotype effect . transcript abundance of 63% of fa synthesis and fa elongation related probes was high at early stages , followed by a gradual decrease, while other probes  show clear genotype differences with higher transcript abundance in the two progeny lines  as compared to the parental genotypes. fa desaturation genes such as ads <dig>  fad <dig> and fad <dig> were up-regulated before  <dig> dap, but fad <dig> and ads <dig> genes including fad <dig> and fad <dig> paralogs were up-regulated after  <dig> dap . triacylglycerides are the main constituents of vegetable oil and expressed at late stages of seed development. genes involved in triacylglycerol biosynthesis, such as dgat- <dig> and − <dig>  grp  and oleosin  were mainly up-regulated after  <dig> dap .

for lipid degradation, four different patterns of transcript abundance were observed. a set of probes  had high transcript abundance at later stages of seed development  , while a larger number of probes  showed higher transcript abundance at earlier stages before  <dig> dap . additional file 12: figure s7c: iii consists of a set of probes  with high transcript abundance only at  <dig> and  <dig> dap. probes  from additional file 12: figure s7c: iv showed genotype differences in transcript abundance with lower levels in parental genotypes pc <dig> and ys <dig>  than in the dh lines.

a set of the genes functionally related and/or co-expressed often share conserved regulatory motifs, which might be responsible for coordinated expression of the set of genes. in this study, genes related to lipid metabolism with different co-expression patterns  were searched to computationally predict cis-acting regulatory elements for potential roles in regulating lipid metabolism during seed development in b. rapa species. for all the selected  <dig> b. rapa genes , the 1000 bp upstream sequence from the gene start were retrieved.

in total,  <dig> regulatory motifs were predicted for fa synthesis and elongation , lipid degradation , lipid desaturation  and triacylglycerol  processes considering gene clusters with comparable patterns in transcript abundance . co-expressed gene clusters from the fa synthesis and elongation, and lipid degradation, and/or other lipid metabolic processes shared most of the motifs . each tf  can have more than one putative binding site in each gene. the dof motif family, including dof <dig>  dof <dig>  pbf and mnb1a, and mads motif-squamosa were specific to the tag biosynthesis process but another mads motif – ag was specific to fa desaturation. tga1a  and myb.ph <dig>  were shared among different co-expression groups of lipid degradation genes. the abi <dig> transcription factor binding site was present in genes involved in tag biosynthesis, fa desaturation and different co-expression groups of lipid degradation, which had high transcript abundance at late stages  . we did not find any motif that is specific to the fa synthesis and elongation process. however, six motifs; hmg- <dig>  hmg-i/y, pend, id <dig>  gamyb and four unknown motifs were shared between two co-expression groups of fa synthesis and elongation genes along with genes from other processes. conserved motifs that were not significantly overrepresented in plant-specific tfs databases are here indicated as “unknown”. motifs such as, hmg- <dig> and pend were specific to only genes involved in tag biosynthesis, and fa synthesis and elongation process. similarly, gamyb  and unknown motifs were specific to only lipid degradation and fa synthesis and elongation process. motifs- bzip <dig> and embp- <dig> from the leucine zipper family were shared among genes from tag biosynthesis and lipid degradation .table  <dig>

genotypic variation in overall metabolism
in total  <dig> modules  were divided into three clusters  in hierarchical cluster based on clear contrasts in patterns of transcript abundance only between the two parental genotypes. probes from cluster iv  were up-regulated in ys <dig> and down-regulated in pc <dig>  while probes in cluster v  had higher transcript abundance in pc <dig> and lower in ys <dig> . these two clusters differentiate the transcript abundance between the two parental genotypes. however, the two dh lines had a mixture of levels of transcript abundance. in contrast, genes belonging to cluster vi  had low transcript abundance in both parents but high in the two progeny dh lines. genes mainly involved in the synthesis and degradation of amino acid, cell wall, hormones, lipids, isoprenoids and ion transport, and also different transcription factors were significantly over- or under- represented in those three clusters .figure  <dig> 
hierarchical cluster analysis  on all probes from four wgcna gene modules with significant genotypic effects. vertical white lines separate genotypes and horizontal white lines separate gene clusters. the bright red to bright green colour represent high to low abundance levels, black for an intermediate level of abundance.



genotypic as well as temporal variation in overall metabolism
six wgcna modules  showed both significant genotypic and temporal variation in anova  and four clusters of probes with different patterns of transcript abundance were observed in a hierarchical cluster analysis . genes in cluster vii  reached their maximum at  <dig> dap, gradually decreasing until  <dig> dap  or  <dig> dap . transcript abundance in pc <dig> was always higher than in other genotypes except at  <dig> dap . transcript abundance of genes from cluster viii . genes in cluster ix  had similar transcript abundance compared to cluster viii with a gradual increase across the developmental stages till  <dig> dap which then remained constant. however, genes from cluster ix had a lower transcript abundance in pc <dig> across time . a larger number of probes  were grouped in cluster x, which showed a maximum at the earlier stages 18– <dig> dap, and then a gradual decrease until  <dig> dap from which time point it remained at a constant level . this transcript abundance was similar to that of cluster vii except for pc <dig>  among the four genotypes across all the time points, cluster x genes had the lowest transcript abundance. these clusters indicate the occurrence of major changes in the transcription profiles between the bent-cotyledon to the fully-developed embryo stages of seed development .figure  <dig>

discussion
the understanding of morphological and transcriptional changes during seed development has fundamental applications in brassica breeding, both for high quality vegetable oil content and for crop establishment. in this study, we focused on analysis of morphological characteristics and global transcriptome analysis in developing seeds of four genotypes including two diverse b. rapa morphotypes: a leafy-type pak choi and an annual yellow-seeded oil-type yellow sarson. we also predict putative regulatory elements for lipid metabolism to understand this complex regulatory network during seed development.

seed morphology varies at the later stages of seed development
seed developmental stages, which are defined based on the shape of the embryo, were similar in both ys <dig> and pc <dig>  irrespective of apparent differences in phenological characteristics, such as flowering time or seed colour in the two distant morphotypes pak choi and yellow sarson . however, the colour of embryo differed among these two genotypes at early stages ; and at later stages . also, seed coat colour changes differed among these two morphotypes, as the seed coat of pc <dig> turns from green to brownish at  <dig> dap, while the ys <dig> seed coat turns yellowish at  <dig> dap . also in the two dh lines, the black/brown-seeded line dh <dig> lost the green colour earlier than the yellow-seeded dh <dig>  yellow seed colour is a desired quality trait in breeding brassica oilseed species, because of its association with higher oil content and more easily digestible seed meal as compared to dark coloured seeds. the accumulation of proanthocyanidins  in the seed coat of immature black/brown seeds  but not in yellow seed  <cit>  might be an explanation for the earlier change in seed colour. in this study, we observed that the embryo completely filled the seed at the bent-cotyledon stage ; also li et al.,  <cit>  described that this stage was not yet reached at  <dig> dap, but fully reached at  <dig> dap in b. campestris . brassica seed is non-endospermic, so, the endosperm is not retained in mature seeds, but only the embryo is enclosed by the seed coat  <cit> . evaluation of transcript abundance using real-time pcr was effective to define six time-points when abundance levels of a set of genes representative for the seed filling process varied with respect to their morphology:  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap ,  <dig> dap  and  <dig> dap,  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap .

seed developmental stages are the predominant cause for variation in transcript abundance
genome-wide transcriptome analysis was used to explore global gene expression at six time points as representative stages for seed development in four genotypes of b. rapa. despite the fact that b. rapa is an important vegetable and/or oil crop, this is the first study in which transcript abundance was profiled genome-wide during seed development in this species. the availability of whole genome sequence of b. rapa <cit>  facilitated the design of a 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray platform  based on predicted gene models from the genome sequence.

we used four approaches to define sets of genes with different transcript abundance during seed development in time  or between genotypes or both. first pca was used to obtain an overview of variation in seed developmental stages and also between different genotypes using all the transcripts present in the microarray . the first principal component  captured mostly temporal variation in transcript abundance, supporting the earlier findings that seed developmental stages are major sources of transcriptional and metabolic variation in arabidopsis <cit> . a comparative study of the transcript and metabolite profiles in both wild-type and transgenic genotypes of arabidopsis also showed more variation across seed developmental stages than changes due to genotypic differences  <cit> . the genotypic variation was captured in pc <dig> , which suggests that metabolic processes inside developing seed are largely conserved, even between yellow-seeded oil and black/brown-seeded genotypes. secondly, we selected a subset of genes with variation in transcript abundance patterns between developmental stages as well as between genotypes based on pca loadings with a minimum two fold change criterion for further analysis. these subsets of genes represent the most active metabolic processes occurring in b. rapa developing seeds, such as photosynthesis, hormonal regulation, stress tolerance, cell wall, lipid, phosphate, amino acid, protein, signal transduction, transport, secondary metabolites, developmental process, and rna processing and regulation of transcription . those selected metabolic processes were also reported as major metabolic processes during seed development in close relatives a. thaliana <cit>  and b. napus <cit> , but also in maize  <cit> . thirdly, a wgcna approach was used to discover possible modules consisting of groups of genes with similar transcript abundance, either across time or between genotypes of both, and  <dig> modules out of a total of  <dig> modules showed significant variation in transcript abundance across time points or genotypes or their combinations . since wgcna uses pearson correlation coefficients to identify co-expressed modules, it could not group genes that have similar patterns of transcript abundance but different levels into separate modules. so, in addition a separate hierarchical clustering using euclidean distance was done in all gene modules according to the type of effects. the combined analysis using both pearson correlation coefficients with wgcna and hierarchical clustering with euclidean distance resulted in clusters that are both similar in transcript abundance and level among genotypes across time points. finally, we focused on transcriptional profiling related to lipid metabolism, in order to correlate co-expression patterns within pathways and to predict putative regulatory elements of lipid metabolism.

global variation in transcript abundance: 25– <dig> dap is a key period for major changes in b. rapa developing seed
in pca, the early time points, before the embryo fills the seed , cluster tightly in pc <dig> but the later time points  cluster loosely, suggesting that physiological processes differentiate more at later stages. higher correlations  between the early time-points within genotypes and decreasing correlations between later stages also supports that there is more variation in transcript abundance at later stages  than at earlier stages . variation in metabolite content, seed maturity, desiccation and dormancy induction occurred during the maturation phase  <cit> , which corresponds to  <dig> dap in this study. interestingly, sequential changes in transcript abundance follow developmental changes in the black/brown-seeded genotypes  but an extreme shift from  <dig> to  <dig> dap and reversed at  <dig> dap occurred in yellow-seeded genotypes . this signifies the different transcriptome signatures of seed development in different genotypes, especially at the later stage. these findings are in agreement with a different timing of seed and embryo colour changes from  <dig> dap onwards . the spatial position of the two dh lines between the two distant parental genotypes in the pc <dig> dimension points to variation in transcript abundance that can be used for genetic studies.

the largest changes in transcript abundance during seed development were observed during 25– <dig> dap , suggesting that this is the most optimal stage for genetical genomics studies for mapping eqtl in b. rapa developing seeds. in contrast, for b. napus, the major transcriptional transition was reported to be much earlier during heart-shaped to torpedo embryo stages i.e. 17– <dig> dap, and for fa synthesis-related genes at  <dig> dap in a spring and winter type b. napus l. cv huyou <dig>  <cit> .

temporal changes in transcript abundance conserved across different morphotypes
the wgcna method is a powerful and widely used tool to identify co-expressed gene clusters and to construct scale-free networks using topological properties of network construction  <cit> . among  <dig> gene modules identified, four  show temporal variation in transcript abundance across seed development , and these were reduced to three clusters after hierarchical clustering using euclidean distance . this result, like pca, confirms that variation in transcript abundance during seed development is predominantly conserved across genotypes in b. rapa. similar observations were made for fa biosynthesis genes, which were conserved between b. napus and a. thaliana <cit> . the annotations of many genes belonging to these three clusters fitted what is known about different processes occurring during seed development. among the three clusters, cluster i  had high transcript abundance before  <dig> dap with a gradual decrease till  <dig> dap, with genes involved in photosynthesis, secondary metabolic pathways, and biosynthesis of tocopherols, mevalonate and carotenoids, and amino acids were over-represented. amino acids are known as essential precursors for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, proteins and other metabolic biosynthetic processes. tocopherols are fat-soluble antioxidants and are one of the breeding goals to improve oil quality. tocopherols accumulate slowly during 12– <dig> dap and reach a maximum concentration during 41- <dig> dap in developing seeds of b. napus <cit> . it has been suggested that production of tocopherols during seed development might be needed for the protection of polyunsaturated fatty acids against peroxidation  <cit> . in cluster ii  and cluster iii  transcript abundance increased gradually or abruptly at 35– <dig> dap, respectively . in these clusters, cytochrome p <dig>  late embryogenesis abundant proteins , ltp  and storage proteins, and abscisic acid and ethylene  were over-represented. this observation is in agreement with a number of other studies where storage proteins, abscisic acid and ethylene were highly expressed during late seed developmental stages because of their roles in growth and development of seed tissues, accumulation of seed reserves, maturation, desiccation tolerance, induction of seed dormancy and the utilization of storage reserves to support germination  <cit> .

gene co-expression patterns associated with genotypic differences, or genotype- and temporal differences
wgcna analysis organized  <dig> probes associated with genetic variation into  <dig> gene modules  , which could be represented by three gene clusters  through hierarchical clustering . these clusters reveal genetic variation in patterns of transcript abundance during seed development, with distinct variation between the two parents with many genes showing transgressive segregation in dh lines.

similarly, sets of genes  displayed variation in transcript abundance due to both genotype and time contrasts in six gene modules . four different patterns were identified in hierarchical clustering, mainly either with a gradual decrease in transcript abundance from early stages to late stages or a continuous increase across seed development . the leafy-type pc <dig> usually showed different patterns of transcript abundance compared to the other three genotypes , while variation in transcript abundance of the two dh lines is more similar to that of the maternal genotype ys <dig>  this could be due to maternal effects on seed and seed characteristics, as reported before in another study  <cit> .

predicting cis-regulatory elements for co-expressed genes related to lipid metabolism
brassica species are widely cultivated for seed oil, and seed oil is also a major source of energy during germination and seedling growth. thus, we want to get an insight in the genetic regulation of lipid metabolism in both oil- and vegetable- morphotypes. first, we defined pathways, such as fa synthesis and elongation, fa desaturation, lipid degradation, triacylglycerol. the co-expression analysis identified clusters of genes in the respective pathways with different transcript abundance. for example, fa synthesis and elongation related genes shared a similar time-dependent  and a genotype-dependent transcript abundance . lipid degradation related genes showed four different patterns of transcript abundance. however, triacylglycerol and fa desaturation biosynthesis processes were highly conserved with similar transcript abundance, increasing during late stages or early to middle stages of development respectively, among all four studied genotypes .

all these different sets of co-expressed genes in different pathways can be regulated by common or specific regulatory elements. the prediction of putative regulatory elements in co-regulated genes can increase our understanding of seed development and results in tools to breed for improved oil content. transcription factors play regulatory roles not only in seed development but also in lipid metabolism  <cit>  and transcription factor binding sites  are usually located in upstream regulatory regions of genes.

the abi <dig> binding motif was shared by genes from the triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathway, fa desaturation and lipid degradation , which were all up-regulated  <dig> dap. motif abi <dig> was reported as an important cis-regulator of the dgat gene of triacylglycerol biosynthesis  <cit>  and repressor of lipid degradation  <cit> , and is known for its role during seed maturation, seed size, seed germination and seedling growth. the aaag binding domain was conserved in motifs dof <dig>  dof <dig>  pbf and mnb1a  and was found specifically in triacylglycerol biosynthesis genes in our seed samples. the roles of dof genes are in activating seed storage protein genes during seed development and germination in rice  <cit> , barley  <cit> , maize  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and arabidopsis <cit> . the interwoven connection of different regulatory motifs in figure  <dig> supports the fact that target genes are regulated by multiple interacting tfs. the interaction between dof proteins and hmg proteins was reviewed in maize seed  <cit> . similarly, the other identified motifs, in this study, that belong to the bzip, mads-box, myb family, beta-beta-alpha zinc finger families, as well as unknown motifs, likely play roles in regulating gene expression during seed development and maturation in b. rapa. some motifs reported in arabidopsis seed that are similar to our findings, such as ag, abi <dig>  squamosa, bzip and pend for triacylglycerol biosynthesis genes, and hmg- <dig> and gamyb for fa synthesis genes  <cit> . moreover, they also reported many more motifs than our findings, and in addition, several motifs observed for triacylglycerol biosynthesis in our study were reported for fa synthesis in this study or vice versa. the possible explanations for finding different numbers of motifs with some disagreement could be  the sequence form 1000 bp upstream plus the utr region was used by  <cit> , but we considered only 1000 bp upstream sequences because the majority of cis-regulatory elements are located in this region  <cit> , and  the use of different motif finding tools; tfbs  <cit>  and fdrmotif  <cit>  by  <cit>  but meme tool  <cit>  in this study. the different tools use different algorithms and that could lead to some differences in finding motifs  <cit> . besides the utr region and the 1000 bp upstream region, cis-regulatory elements can also be located in the downstream sequence, in the gene’s introns or in neighbouring genes’ introns  <cit>  and consideration of these genomic regions can potentially improve in finding tfs binding motifs.

CONCLUSIONS
a morphological characterization of developing embryos and seeds of two different morphotypes of brassica rapa, a pak choi and a yellow sarson, showed that the seed developmental stages based on the shape of the embryo were similar in both morphotypes, but the colour of embryo and seed coat differed at both earlier  and later stages . analysis of transcript abundance measured with qrt-pcr of ten selected genes from different metabolic processes suggested to use six time points  for a global gene expression study using microarrays. in this study, done on pak choi, yellow sarson, and two doubled haploid lines from their cross we found that most changes in transcript abundance occur between  <dig> and  <dig> dap, suggesting that the timing of metabolic processes during seed development in b. rapa is later than in b napus. we identified  <dig> gene modules of which  <dig> showed genotypic variation in transcript abundance,  <dig> showed temporal variation and  <dig> showed both temporal and genotypic variation. this study shows that temporal transcriptional variation is more dominant than morphotype or genotype differences. since lipids are the major storage compounds of brassica seeds, we investigated putative cis-regulatory elements of co-regulated gene clusters involved in lipid metabolism. in total  <dig> putative cis-regulatory elements were predicted in 1000 bp upstream region, which are either specific for or common to four co-regulated gene clusters. this study provides detailed information on transcriptional changes during brassica seed development and provides a starting point for a genetical genomics study of seed quality traits.
