BACKGROUND
a rapid response to counter and contain microbial infection is provided by the innate immune system in all multicellular organisms. a key component of the innate immune response is the broad spectrum of antimicrobial proteins that can either be constitutively expressed on epithelia or be induced during inflammation  <cit> . there is evidence for extensive diversity of antimicrobial proteins, with different genes arising by duplication followed by positive adaptive selection  <cit> . analysing the history of duplication and sequence variation of these antimicrobial genes will help us to understand how selection by infectious diseases has led to functional adaptation at the molecular level.

the beta-defensins are a family of genes which has key roles in the innate immune response, such as antimicrobial activity, antiviral activity and signalling  <cit> . some members have also been shown to have an important role in reproduction – for example the protein encoded by defb <dig> coats the sperm surface and mediates attachment of the sperm to the oviduct  <cit> . evolutionary analyses of the beta-defensins have produced evidence for repeated rounds of duplication and divergence of the mature peptide by positive selection. most convincing are studies which show rapid duplication and divergence of beta-defensin genes since mouse and rat divergence, supporting a birth-and-death model for beta-defensin evolution in the rodents  <cit> .

infectious disease is likely to have been a major selective agent in human evolution  <cit> . changes of habitat and of social system during evolution of hominids, and other primates, alter the spectrum of infectious diseases encountered at different times and by different species. aspects of more recent human evolution are also likely to have been driven by infectious disease: archaeological evidence suggests that individuals in agricultural populations would have suffered more from "crowd diseases" compared to hunter-gatherers, due to the proximity of domestic animals and of each other  <cit> . as well as an increase in infectious disease, the transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer is likely to have had an effect on the genes of the different populations in other ways, such as changes in diet and reproductive behaviour  <cit> .

in order to understand the evolutionary pressures on beta-defensins in primates, we determined putative orthologues of human beta-defensins from six other catarrhine primate species: chimpanzee , gorilla , orangutan , gibbon , long-tailed macaque  and rhesus macaque . we used the known branching order of the primate phylogeny, together with a maximum-likelihood approach using different models of evolution, to test whether positive selection has acted on these genes. analysing selection in the catarrhine lineage allowed us to identify specific codons in certain beta-defensins that showed a response to environmental change over the last  <dig> million years. by analysing the variation in these genes in a cohort of hunter-gatherer and agricultural human populations, we infer their more recent evolution and discuss whether population-specific selection processes are responsible for the patterns of variation.

RESULTS
comparative sequence analysis
the beta-defensin gene family is defined by a six-cysteine core motif  which was previously used as a motif to search the genome for additional beta-defensins  <cit> . some of these were confirmed to encode full-length mrna transcripts and code for proteins whose amino acid sequence differed considerably outside the shared core motif  <cit> . this coding sequence difference between beta-defensin genes continues into intronic sequence, so that both coding sequence and intronic sequence can define clear orthologues between humans, chimpanzees and rhesus macaques. in addition, according to the current genome assemblies  the expected syntenic relationships are maintained across these three species. by designing primers in non-coding sequences that clearly distinguish between beta-defensin genes, we identified and sequenced putative orthologues in six primate species of coding sequences for all  <dig> beta-defensin genes for which full-length transcript evidence existed in humans at the start of the project .

using the information from the known phylogeny of the primate species, we assessed the orthologous sequences for evidence of positive selection. we analysed the ratio  between the non-synonymous substitution rate and the synonymous substitution rate, using a maximum-likelihood technique implemented by the program paml. this uses models that allow rates of evolution to vary between codons, so allowing the identification of specific positions likely to have undergone positive selection  <cit> . five genes showed evidence of positive selection: defb <dig>  defb <dig>  defb <dig>  defb <dig> and defb <dig> . codon  <dig> of defb <dig> has been positively selected and is very variable between species , and analysis of ancestral sequences suggests that this codon has independently mutated five times during primate evolution .

copy number analysis
we and others have previously shown a cluster of beta-defensin genes  to be copy number variable in humans; the neighbouring defb <dig> gene is not involved in this copy number variation  <cit> . it is essential to understand whether a gene is copy number variable in order to correctly interpret apparently heterozygous snp sites, and to be aware of the possibility of gene conversion between closely related paralogues.

we used multiplex amplifiable probe hybridisation  to examine whether other members of the beta-defensin family varied in copy number, in addition to those previously described. maph is a method for gene copy number analysis that relies on quantitative recovery of amplifiable probes following hybridisation to genomic dna  <cit> . using maph probes for the beta-defensin gene regions analysed in this study, we asked whether there was any evidence of copy number variation in the  <dig> dna samples used for the population analyses described in this paper, and in a further  <dig> individuals from the uk. we reasoned that variation between duplicate tests of individuals would be highly correlated where underlying copy number variation was the main cause of the variation, but less correlated, if at all, when the main cause was random experimental noise. the correlation between the two sets of raw maph results for  <dig> samples was calculated, and the probes mapping to the copy number variable region at 8p <dig>  showed high correlation coefficients . all other beta-defensin probes showed correlation coefficients less than  <dig>  , and there was no grouping of samples on scatterplots indicative of rarer deletion or duplication polymorphisms.

population analyses
the second exon, which codes for the entire mature peptide, was resequenced from all five beta-defensins that showed positive selection, in a panel of  <dig> individuals from four human populations. twenty polymorphic sites were found, of which  <dig> are predicted to change an amino acid, and only  <dig> are present in dbsnp release  <dig> .

the number of synonymous and non-synonymous polymorphic sites and fixed differences between the human and macaque exon  <dig> sequence was determined . a mcdonald-kreitman test was performed on each gene, and on the pooled results, to test for an excess of non-synonymous fixed substitutions which suggests the influence of positive selection of the gene  <cit> . none of the tests showed significant evidence of selection , in contrast to the results obtained from the ω-tests using paml. this difference could be due to the small number of changes and polymorphic sites in each test, which is a reflection of the small size of the genes; but pooling the data from all five genes also failed to show a significant result. more plausibly, the discrepancy could be due to the high numbers of non-synonymous polymorphisms identified in humans . five of these are singletons, but eleven were identified in two or more samples, suggesting that they may be at appreciable frequencies in different populations.

we analysed the frequencies of the polymorphisms in four different population samples: hunter-gatherers mbuti/biaka  and indigenous australian , and agriculturalists british  and sub-saharan african  . a fisher's exact test of independence between africans and non-africans reveals significant differences in allele frequency for many polymorphisms, as expected. the strongest differences in allele frequencies were for the r71s and g31r polymorphic sites in defb <dig>  two dna polymorphisms, both affecting codon site  <dig> in defb <dig>  showed significantly different frequencies between agricultural and hunter-gather populations.

analysis of defb <dig> and defb132
we decided to study the haplotype structure of both defb <dig> and defb <dig> genes by complete resequencing. for defb <dig>  resequencing  <dig> bases spanning exon  <dig> from  <dig> chromosomes revealed  <dig> polymorphic sites associating to form  <dig> haplotypes, inferred from diplotype data by maximum-likelihood analysis . for defb <dig>  resequencing  <dig> bases spanning exons  <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig> human chromosomes revealed  <dig> polymorphic sites associated to form  <dig> haplotypes, determined unambiguously by allele-specific pcr . we analysed the forces affecting variation at different loci by calculating various summary statistics from the haplotype data at both defb <dig> and defb <dig> in each population . both genes show high values for gene diversity , indicating a high degree of heterozygosity in all populations. there are four estimates of the population mutation parameter , derived from levels of homozygosity , number of segregating sites , nucleotide diversity , and the expected number of alleles .

tajima's d compares the distribution of rare frequency alleles with intermediate frequency alleles by comparing θs with θπ. defb <dig> gives a significantly negative value for the mb and a significantly positive value for the uk population, which may indicate balancing selection. however, this statistic is known to be sensitive to demographic changes: a negative value may result from a population expansion and a positive value from population subdivision. fay and wu's h statistic compares the distribution of common frequency alleles with intermediate frequency alleles by comparing θh with θπ, and is more robust to demographic changes  <cit> . for defb <dig>  d, h, and fu's fs are all significantly negative for the mb population, which suggests directional selection in this population. for defb <dig>  tajima's d is significantly positive in the uk population reflection a signal of either balancing selection or population subdivision.

mismatch analysis
a mismatch distribution is a histogram showing the number of mismatches when all haplotypes are compared with each other, and describes the haplotype structure of a region. figure 2a shows the mismatch distributions for defb <dig> and figure 2b shows the mismatch distributions for defb <dig>  on each graph the expected distribution given neutrality with a constant population size is shown , and the expected distribution given a recent population expansion is also shown .

for defb <dig>  all distributions are characterised by a strong bimodal pattern inconsistent with a model reflecting neutrality, constant population size or a population expansion. in each distribution, the second peak is at around  <dig> differences, with the exception of ssa, where the second peak is at around  <dig> differences. the strongest bimodal distribution is in the uk population, reflecting two deep haplotype clades at similar frequency, and suggests balancing selection at this locus in this population. this supports the result from the tajima's d test. for defb <dig>  the ssa, uk and mb populations show a bimodal distribution also inconsistent with a model reflecting neutrality, constant population size or a population expansion. for the ia population, the distribution is more consistent with neutrality, either with a constant population size or an expansion.

network analysis
network diagrams can be used to show haplotype structure graphically. each haplotype is a node on the diagram linked to other haplotypes that differ by one nucleotide position. they also convey haplotype frequency and distribution information by the size and composition of the pie chart at each node. analysis of the haplotype network for defb <dig> reveals that the bimodal mismatch distribution reflects haplotypes carrying a glycine at position  <dig> and an arginine at position  <dig>  and a highly diverged haplotype clade carrying an arginine at position  <dig> and a serine at position  <dig>  .

the defb <dig> haplotypes are shown on a network diagram together with the root haplotype . there are four coding alleles at codon 93: valine, which is ancestral and the most common; alanine, which is observed in mb population and one ssa individual; threonine, seen only in the ia and mb; and isoleucine, seen in one ia individual. this suggests that some ancient haplotypes carrying the coding variation at codon  <dig> have persisted in geographically dispersed hunter-gatherer populations. this could be due to absence of purifying selection that has operated in agricultural populations  <cit> . the network shows a reticulation and several branches caused either by recurrent mutation or recombination – only polymorphisms  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> occur on one branch of the network.

genomic region analysis
analysis using hapmap data  <cit>  shows that both diverged defb <dig> haplotypes are present in european, chinese and japanese, extending as an essentially non-recombining haplotype block for about  <dig> kb, but neither the r31s <dig> haplotype nor its constituent alleles are found in the yoruba from nigeria . using the ceph hapmap data, an ehh test was performed to analyse for signatures of recent selection  <cit> . no haplotype has extended haplotype homozygosity with respect to the other, suggesting that the observed frequencies were not generated by recent positive selection for one or other haplotype . it is unclear why the r31s <dig> haplotype is not seen in the ssa population nor in the nigerian yoruba hapmap population. there are three possible explanations: that it has been carried across the world in the out of africa expansion, and has been lost in certain populations by drift; that it has been maintained in certain populations by balancing selection; or it is a product of a relatively recent hybridisation event.

to exclude selection at another linked gene being responsible for this haplotype pattern, we first examined the extent of linkage disequilibrium across this region in the ceph hapmap samples. the only other gene on the same haplotype block, and therefore possibly associated with defb <dig>  was defb <dig>   <dig> kb away. resequencing of exon  <dig> of defb <dig> found two deletion polymorphisms which substantially altered the c-terminal tail amino acid sequence of defb <dig> . these were candidate functional polymorphisms that could have caused a selective sweep affecting polymorphism frequencies and association at defb <dig>  to investigate this, we genotyped  <dig> northern european individuals for the two polymorphisms at defb <dig>  and the two deletion polymorphisms in defb <dig>  maximum-likelihood estimation found no evidence of linkage disequilibrium between the markers at defb <dig> and at defb <dig> , although there was very strong association  between the two polymorphic sites within defb <dig> . therefore there is no evidence of a selective sweep driven by these variant alleles at defb <dig> 

discussion
we have identified five beta-defensin genes that have undergone positive selection in primates, including defb <dig> and defb <dig>  whose protein products show evidence of direct antimicrobial action in urogenital tissues  <cit> . the selected position in defb <dig> has been shown to be directly involved in antimicrobial activity and signalling  <cit> , and natural selection has modulated its charge and polarity in response to the microbial environment. the results broadly agree with a previous analysis of the 8p <dig>  cluster  <cit> : we agree that there is no support for the previously suggested effect of selection on the amino acid sequence of defb <dig>  <cit> . more generally, we note that the genes on 8p <dig>  that are variable in copy number among humans show no evidence of positive selection in the last  <dig> million years. this could be because the copy number variable beta-defensins tend to be shorter, and the analyses lack power when analysing short coding sequences. alternatively, there could be a causal association between copy number variation and the likelihood of coding sequence diversification by positive selection. in primates and the dog, the chromosome  <dig> cluster does not seem to have undergone as much duplication and rapid divergence since species divergence as rodents  <cit> . in horses, there appears to have been a rapid duplication and divergence of the defb <dig> orthologue  <cit> , and a similar process may have occurred in goats  <cit> . it also appears that the defb <dig> and defb <dig> orthologues have been positively selected in the old world monkey cercopithecus aethiops  <cit> , so further investigation in different catarrhine clades, as well as platyrrhines and other primates, is necessary. the question remains whether, in copy number variable genes, extensive divergence is prevented by purifying selection and gene conversion, or by balancing selection maintaining a pool of similar variants that are shuffled by gene conversion. determining whether the same loci are copy number variable loci between different primates, and whether copy number variation exists in other mammals, will help to answer this question.

we have used a top-down evolutionary approach to identify variation in genes that is likely to be functional, and has been driven by selection. in doing so, we have revealed high levels of beta-defensin diversity in human populations, but the forces driving this diversity are difficult to identify. defb <dig> diversity involves two positions that distinguish two deep-rooting haplotypes, suggesting that there are epistatic interactions between the two amino acids and that both haplotypes have been preserved by balancing selection. balancing selection has been suggested to maintain variation at several other innate immune genetic loci, such as cd209l cell-surface receptor  <cit>  and the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors   <cit> , and at loci involved in reproduction, such as zonadhesin  <cit> . by chemical synthesis, reconstruction and folding of the core n-terminal sequence, defb <dig> was shown not to have antimicrobial activity  <cit> . however, defb <dig>  like several other beta-defensins, is expressed in the epidydimis and may be involved in sperm maturation or reproduction. evidence for directional selection in the mbuti/biaka population indicates contrasting selection pressures in different populations due the different environmental pressures that these populations have faced. whether balancing selection has been a major force in the human genome is disputed, and distinguishing signatures of balancing selection from neutral variation is difficult without a clear prior hypothesis concerning the potential mechanism of balancing selection in a given candidate gene  <cit> .

defb <dig> has been positively selected in the catarrhine lineage, and is highly variable in human populations. however, in humans there is only evidence from mismatch distribution analysis of any statistical departure from neutral evolution at this locus, though the power of the analyses could be limited by the small region analysed. one codon is polymorphic in hunter gatherer populations, coding for four amino acids , but in agricultural populations  <dig> out of  <dig> chromosomes carry a valine at this position. genetic differentiation tests reveal a similar contrast between agricultural and hunter-gatherer populations; as expected african and non-african populations are significantly differentiated for both defb <dig>  and defb <dig> , but for defb <dig> the agricultural and non-agricultural populations are also differentiated . the basis for any selective pressure is unclear:defb <dig> is expressed in the testis, and possibly elsewhere, is secreted and is likely to be antimicrobial although that has not been directly tested  <cit> .

we have shown that beta-defensins have different patterns of selection, and one of the selected amino acids has been shown to be antimicrobial and involved in cell-cell signalling. the challenge will be to relate evolutionary changes in amino acid sequences to differences in antimicrobial, cell-signalling or sperm function. both a comprehensive picture of the evolution of these genes by identifying orthologues in other mammalian species, and a concurrent effort into characterising the function of these orthologues, is needed in order to fully understand the role of this gene family in innate immunity and reproduction.

CONCLUSIONS
several beta-defensin genes show positive selection in catarrhine primates, including defb <dig>  defb <dig> and defb <dig>  but not the beta-defensin genes involved in common copy number variation on chromosome 8p <dig> . there is suggestive evidence of different selective pressures on these genes in humans, with defb <dig> showing evidence of balancing selection. given the multifunctional role of the beta-defensin family, however, the nature of the selective pressure remains unclear and is likely to differ between populations.
