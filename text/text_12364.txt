BACKGROUND
reserpine, an alkaloid isolated from rauwolfia species, was introduced for the treatment of hypertension and schizophrenia in 1950's but was replaced by more effective drugs by the end of 1970's  <cit> . reserpine is known to act centrally as well as peripherally by depletion of biogenic amines like noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin. mostly, its peripheral depletion of amines is responsible for its antihypertensive effect while its central depletion of amines is responsible for its antipsychotic action  <cit> . however, because of its central action it produces sedation and parkinsonism when used for the management of hypertension for prolonged periods  <cit> . as a result it has reduced usage for chronic treatment in hypertensive patients and its use is limited to selective patient population only  <cit> . hence there is a need for structural modification of the drug to make it more acceptable therapeutically for the treatment of hypertension.

attempts were made in the past to synthesize derivatives of reserpine with possibly higher and/or modified activities or with fewer side effects  <cit> . compared to reserpine itself, a number of reserpine analogues were found to exert a stronger influence on the amine concentration in the periphery than in brain  <cit> .

based on the poor ability of quaternary compounds to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, a great deal of research has been devoted towards quaternization of existing drugs to achieve preferential peripheral action  <cit> . earlier reports have demonstrated the synthesis of quaternary derivatives of reserpine and isoreserpine, however their pharmacology was not studied  <cit> . previous studies by our group also revealed that reserpine methiodide produced selective depletion of peripheral biogenic amines without affecting their central stores  <cit> . in the present investigation, a quaternary analogue of reserpine viz., reserpine methonitrate , which was synthesized in our laboratory was evaluated in rats for its amine depleting actions compared to reserpine. for this, the urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid , 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid  and homovanillic acid  which are the respective metabolites of noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine were estimated after reserpine or rmn treatment in rats. the change in the blood pressure response of anaesthetized rats after treatment with rmn was also evaluated in comparison to reserpine.

RESULTS
biochemical estimations
the main aim of the study was to determine whether rmn was able to deplete the central and peipheral biogenic amines to the same extent as produced by reserpine. reserpine at a dose of  <dig> mg/kg body weight produced significant increase in the urinary excretion profile of vma compared to control animals. the analogue at doses equimolar to reserpine of  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg body weight produced more significant increase in vma excretion compared to controls and that observed with reserpine . however, the higher dose  of rmn did not further enhance the excretion of vma produced by  <dig> mg/kg body weight dose.

significant increase in 5-hiaa excretion was observed with reserpine at a dose of  <dig> mg/kg body weight and with the equivalent dose of rmn . the amount of 5-hiaa excreted in animals treated with the analogue/reserpine was found to be more than in the control. however the effect was found to be more with analogue compared to reserpine. the enhancement in dose to  <dig> mg/kg body weight of rmn did not produce any further increase in 5-hiaa excretion.

a marked increase in the hva excretion was observed in animals treated with reserpine compared to controls while minor change was observed in animals treated with rmn at doses of  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg body weight compared to control .

effect on normal blood pressure of anaesthetized rats
the effect of reserpine and rmn on the normal blood pressure of anaesthetized rats was shown in table  <dig>  dose dependent hypotension was observed with reserpine as well as with rmn. however, the vehicle  also produced hypotension which was approximately  <dig> mm hg from basal level. reserpine at doses of  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/kg produced significant  reduction in blood pressure compared to control. rmn was also found to produce significant  decrease in blood pressure at doses of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/kg body weight compared to control

discussion
the structural modification of existing drugs to achieve selective action is not uncommon in providing better pharmaceutical care to the needy patients. it has been well established that the antihypertensive and tranquilizing actions of reserpine are mediated through the depletion of biogenic amines in the body  <cit> . the peripheral depletion of amines is responsible for its antihypertensive effect  <cit>  while their central depletion plays a role in sedation and depression of reserpine  <cit> . reserpine exerts its depleting effect by specifically inhibiting the adenosine triphosphate-mg2+-dependent incorporation of biogenic amines into their storage vesicles  <cit> .

since reserpine depletes noradrenaline, 5-ht and dopamine from their storage sites, this results in a consequent increase in their metabolite levels in urine. previous investigators have demonstrated a marked increase in the urinary excretion of peripheral and central metabolites of biogenic amines in animals treated with reserpine  <cit> .

in the present investigation, a non-invasive biochemical approach was followed to determine the  <dig> h urinary excretion of vma, 5-hiaa and hva in rats treated with reserpine or rmn. moreover, vma, the peripheral metabolite of noradrenaline; 5-hiaa, the main metabolite of serotonin; and hva, the predominant metabolite of dopamine were selected as the biomarkers for evaluation since noradrenaline exists both centrally and peripherally, serotonin exists mainly peripherally while majority of dopamine exists centrally. since 99% of the total body's content of serotonin is present in the periphery, it is considered that the major part of the excreted 5-hiaa is from the peripheral release  <cit> . similarly, high levels of dopamine are found in the centre rather than periphery, and any change in the hva excretion in urine was considered as a corresponding change in dopamine levels at the central regions  <cit> . these indices provide an indirect evidence for the peripheral and central monoamine depleting effects of reserpine and its quaternary analogue.

the results showed that reserpine increased the urinary excretion of vma, 5-hiaa and hva indicating the depletion of peripheral as well as central biogenic amines. these are in agreement with the results observed by previous investigators  <cit> . the increase in the urinary excretion of vma and 5-hiaa with rmn is higher than with reserpine at equimolar dose of  <dig> mg/kg body weight. the localized distribution of the analogue in the periphery could led to higher level of depletion of peripheral noradrenaline and serotonin hence their metabolite levels were found to be increased much more which also substantiate our previous studies  <cit> . the inability of the analogue to increase hva excretion unlike reserpine could be due to its non-entry across the blood-brain barrier and into the central nervous system to deplete dopamine which is present predominantly in mesolimbic, nigrostriatal and tuberoinfendibular systems  <cit> .

the increased urinary levels of 5-hiaa observed with rmn could be due to the peripheral release of 5-ht as it is found predominantly at the periphery in enterochromaffin cells. the higher dose  of rmn did not produce any further increase in the vma and 5-hiaa excretion compared to lower dose. the possible reason for this effect could be that  <dig> mg/kg dose was sufficient to deplete the amines completely from the storage sites.

in order to evaluate whether the quaternary analogue of reserpine  still retains the peripheral blood pressure lowering activity, further experiments were carried out on the blood pressure of anaesthetized rats. thus far, the results of rmn on the blood pressure response of anaesthetized rats confirmed that the peripheral actions of reserpine molecule are not affected by quaternization. however, in the present study the vehicle  also produced minor hypotensive effect on blood pressure of rats when administered alone with the dose used for the administration of the drugs. earlier workers  <cit>  also reported hypotension with dmso supporting the present observations. reserpine produced dose dependent reduction in blood pressure as demonstrated by previous investigators  <cit> . as indicated in earlier reports  <cit>  the hypotensive effect of reserpine observed in rats is due to the depletion of catecholamines from the peripheral stores.

the effect of equimolar doses of rmn also indicated hypotension however, with higher doses compared to reserpine. it is further indicated that quaternization of reserpine not only restricted the entry of rmn to central nervous system but also reduced to the target tissue in the periphery. hence relatively higher doses were required to produce reserpine like effect. mechanistically, the hypotensive actions of rmn could also be due to peripheral depletion of catecholamines as evident from the positive correlation with the results of previous section on the peripheral depletion of monoamines.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study indicated that the quaternization of reserpine molecule prevents its access into the central nervous system and thereby produces selective peripheral depletion of biogenic amines. furthermore, the study indicated that quaternization of reserpine had not abolished the hypotensive response but only higher doses were required.
