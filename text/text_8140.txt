BACKGROUND
the study of genetics of quantitative traits has benefited from the availability of new technologies that generate massive information at the genomic and transcriptomic levels  <cit> . microarray technology has been recognized as a powerful tool that could aid in the identification of the genes underlying quantitative trait loci . microarray data can be analyzed within a qtl context following a genetical genomics  approach  <cit> . this methodology considers gene expression values as a quantitative trait that can be mapped to chromosomal locations in a segregating population. such genomic positions are called expression qtl , which can be either cis- or trans-acting modifiers of gene expression, depending on whether they are located in the vicinity of or far from the measured gene, respectively. in practice, the validity of this distinction depends on the resolution of the qtl analysis, i.e., the density of the genetic map and the size of the segregating population  <cit> . here we refer to qtl for phenotypes other than gene expression as pqtl to differentiate them from eqtl.

some general ideas on eqtl can be drawn from relevant gg studies. experiments in yeast  <cit> , maize and mouse  <cit> , and humans  <cit>  found that most transcripts are affected by multiple loci, with each locus accounting for less than one third of parental expression differences. eqtl with the largest effects are located in close proximity to the target gene , which are referred to as proximal or cis eqtl  <cit> . however, most of the detected eqtl have been found to be trans-acting. the overall distribution of eqtl along the genome reveals the presence of "hot spots" with trans-eqtl for a large number of genes genome-wide  <cit> . these hubs of trans-eqtl do not necessarily represent transcription factors, but more likely represent a heterogeneous group of transcription regulators  <cit>  or could simply be the result of unaccounted nongenetic correlation among transcripts  <cit> . when real, trans-eqtl hot spots can be used to identify gene modules under common genetic regulation  <cit> . their detection, however, requires a larger sample size than typical gg studies provide; hence, they are missed in smaller-scale designs  <cit> . cis-eqtl are unique by some desirable properties, e.g.,  known location of the causal gene and  their effect sizes are usually large and can be detected with smaller sample sizes. in general, cis-eqtl are regarded as strong quantitative trait gene  candidates when they are located under pqtl, their expression is correlated with the phenotype, and they tend to be located in regions not involved in identity-by-descent  relationships  <cit> . however, the cost of large-scale microarray profiling of a segregating population restricts the application of the gg approach. therefore, experimental designs requiring a lower number of microarrays for the identification of cis-eqtl are desirable.

an alternative approach is defined in this paper as the qtl/microarray approach. this approach refers to the combined use of traditional qtl mapping and subsequent microarray profiling of nonrecombinant parental or congenic strains to reduce the number of candidate genes in qtl regions  <cit> . the methodology used in qtl/microarray studies, even though it varies among researchers, shares some common procedures that can be summarized as follows:  qtl mapping experiment and identification of genes located within confidence or support intervals for qtl,  a test of differential expression between parental strains ,  cross-reference list of positional candidates from step  <dig> and expression candidates from step  <dig>   hypothesis- or knowledge-driven filtering of the list of candidates,  independent confirmation of differential expression, and  experimental validation of causative genes. step  <dig> sometimes compares gene expression on congenic and background strains  or between animals with extreme phenotypes from a segregating population . step  <dig> often involves measuring expression of candidate genes by qrt-pcr in an independent set of samples, but can also involve northern or western blot analysis. step  <dig> is usually part of a separate project that follows a qtl/microarray study.

the rationale behind qtl/microarray studies is that causative genes may have polymorphisms causing differences in their level of expression that translate into varying amounts of mrna and ultimately varying amounts of functional proteins, leading to observable phenotypes. there are several mechanisms by which a qtg could change gene expression levels. a mutation in the binding site for a transcription factor may, for instance, decrease its binding affinity to the ligand, affecting the gene's transcription level  <cit> . mutations in the transcription factors themselves could also affect recognition of their targets, thus also changing the gene's transcription level. likewise, nonsense mutations in the coding sequence of a gene can decrease transcript levels by nonsense-mediated decay  <cit> .

in contrast to the gg approach, transcript profiling of nonrecombinant animals does not allow qtl mapping of the expression levels and therefore cannot differentiate between cis- and trans-eqtl. however, co-localization of a differentially expressed gene and the pqtl can be tested, given that a physical, or genetic, map is available for the genes. this would be equivalent to a cis-eqtl/pqtl co-localization test for the genes under cis control. an approach for sorting out cis- from trans-eqtl in this experimental design consists of first isolating the genomic region with the pqtl in a congenic strain by backcrossing a donor strain to a recipient strain for multiple generations and then testing differential gene expression between the congenic and the recipient background strain. depending on the size of the congenic strain, differentially expressed genes in the donor region are likely to be under cis regulation or alternatively by trans control from linked genes within the limits of the congenic interval. in contrast, differential expression of genes outside the donor region is expected to be regulated, directly or indirectly, by genes located within the congenic interval. contaminating donor dna in places outside the congenic donor region could produce false trans-eqtl. however, nonrecombinant individuals from an f <dig> cross between the congenic and background strains can be used to randomize the effect of contaminating regions.

the qtl/microarray approach is not exempt from issues that need to be addressed. a well-known problem associated with these studies is that dna polymorphisms can affect the binding of microarray probes and significantly decreasing detectable signals. such artifacts can produce an increase in false-positive results when genetically divergent individuals are compared with microarrays  <cit> . presumably, however, this is not the only issue that may affect qtl/microarray results. despite the wide use of the approach, no systematic evaluation of its performance has been reported.

in the current paper, a critical study of the qtl/microarray approach applied to the analysis of complex traits with clinical relevance in humans was performed. first, the literature was reviewed and a meta-analysis of rodent studies that have implemented this approach was conducted. second, a microarray experiment with three mouse congenic strains was designed to test whether differential expression is associated with qtl peaks. the advantages and limitations of the qtl/microarray approach are discussed, and recommendations for the effective use of microarrays for the dissection of complex traits are provided.

RESULTS
literature review
thirty-seven published studies using the qtl/microarray approach in rats  or mice  were examined for key features of their experimental design. most of the microarrays used were whole-genome arrays, including both cdna, especially for older studies, and oligonucleotide arrays. although the objective of using microarrays in most of these studies was similar, i.e., identification of differentially expressed genes under pqtl peaks, the methodologies used varied greatly. particularly, no standards were followed in the statistical methodologies used for testing differential expression. some studies do not report the methodology used at all  <cit> . others report from one to three sequentially applied criteria to select lists of differentially expressed genes, which varied in nature and in statistical support. for instance, arbitrary thresholds by absolute intensity difference or fold changes   <cit> , different combinations of fc and t-statistics  <cit> , ranking by fc and selecting only the top  <dig> most significant genes  <cit> , correlation to a hypothetical constant gene  <cit> , and concordance in fc direction across experimental groups  <cit> , among others . although applying multiple criteria can be attractive in terms of reducing the number of candidates, this is likely to reduce power in an unpredictable manner. this is further complicated when a criterion such as fold change  is used, which has unknown significance level.

in some cases, the qtl/microarray design has led to the identification of a qtg. in rats, two studies were identified confirming the role of qtgs, i.e., cd <dig> in insulin resistance  <cit>  and klk <dig> in hypertension  <cit> . using a cdna microarray, the cd <dig> gene was selected as differentially expressed in adipose tissue between two divergent inbred strains of rats as well as between a congenic strain isolating a qtl on chromosome  <dig> and the background strain. this gene was located within the limits of the congenic donor region, but it was not mentioned whether other genes in the region were also differentially expressed  <cit> . this finding suggested cd <dig> as a candidate associated with insulin resistance syndromes. northern blots and sequencing revealed that the microarray probe targeting the 3' end of the mrna molecule detected alternative splicing of the last exon and not differential expression. this was translated into absence of protein levels in plasma, and a transgenic model confirmed the effects of cd <dig> on lipid levels in the blood  <cit> . it was not mentioned by atiman et al.  <cit>  how many genes were located within the congenic region, presumably because it was not known at the time of publication, when a physical map of the rat genome was not available. unfortunately, the identity of the microsatellite markers defining the donor region was not provided, and it was not possible to calculate the size of the region. for this reason, the study by aitman et al.  <cit>  was not included in the meta-analysis in table  <dig>

anumber of pqtl candidate genes was extracted from references or calculated from ucsc genome browser within the limits of the pqtl confidence intervals or congenic donor regions. selected genes columns indicate number of differentially expressed genes genome-wide  or in candidate regions . or columns denote the ratio of odds, i.e. fraction of candidate genes in the selected and in the references sets. p-values  for over-  or under-representation  of qtl candidate genes in list of selected genes were calculated using the genome and microarray probes as reference . significant p-values  are shown in bold.

the qtl/microarray approach has been extensively used to study hypertension. a total of nine studies were identified that compared gene expression between rat strains that showed spontaneous difference for blood pressure  <cit>  or between congenic and background strains created from these lines  <cit> . these studies have led to the direct identification of as many as  <dig> candidate genes for hypertension and to the confirmation of at least one causal gene, namely, klk <dig>  <cit> . instead of microarrays, iwai et al.  <cit>  used real-time polymerase chain reaction  to test  <dig> transcripts located within the confidence interval for the qtl position. it was reported that among  <dig> transcripts that were detected in kidney tissue, two were differentially expressed, i.e., klk <dig> and ngfg. from these, only klk <dig> was confirmed by western blot analysis  <cit> . the role of klk <dig> as a qtg was confirmed by alleviation of hypertension symptoms through adenoviral transfer of human kallikrein  <dig>  because expression profiling was restricted to the target region of the qtl, this study was not included in the overrepresentation test in table  <dig> 

among the mouse studies reviewed, one qtg was identified using the qtl/microarray approach, i.e., alox <dig>  klein et al.  <cit>  generated a congenic strain to isolate a qtl for peak bone mineral density on mouse chromosome  <dig> that was previously identified by klein et al.  <cit> . this was followed by measuring gene expression in kidney tissue using a whole genome high-density array . alox <dig> was the only gene reported as being differentially expressed in the congenic region between the strains. this was confirmed by qrt-pcr in kidney and osteoblast cell cultures. furthermore, the role of alox <dig> was confirmed by a complementation test with an alox15-/- knockout mouse as well as two drugs that inhibit the protein product coded by this gene  <cit> . there are over  <dig> genes known in the donor region for the congenic strain, so as in previous examples, after qtl mapping, microarray testing was the single step that reduced the number of candidate genes the most. unfortunately, it was not reported how many genes were differentially expressed genome-wide, and therefore this study also had to be excluded from our tests in table  <dig> 

meta-analysis
because of missing information, statistical testing could be performed on only  <dig> of the  <dig> studies compiled . in addition, microarrays do not cover all genes in the genome  <cit> . to control for the differences in the level of genome coverage between platforms used in each study, the meta-analysis was performed using two reference sets: genes in the genome and probes in the microarray . filtering by differential expression, on average, selected  <dig> % of pqtl candidates' genes . of  <dig> publications with sufficient information,  <dig>  reported differentially expressed genes that were significantly enriched and  <dig>  studies were underrepresented for genes within the pqtl or congenic region when compared with the whole genome . when using probes in the array as a reference,  <dig>  were overrepresented and  <dig>  were underrepresented . the four experiments that were underrepresented for candidates only when using genes in the microarray as reference were performed on microarrays with low genome coverage  or on filter arrays  <cit> . because the number of pqtl candidates represented in the microarrays was not available, we used the total number of genes under qtl intervals as an approximation. low genome coverage produced overestimation of the true number of tested candidates, explaining their apparent underrepresentation among differentially expressed genes in these platforms.

the number of tests for differential expression applied in each study was used to question whether increasing the number of selection criteria increases the probability of selecting qtl candidate genes. no such trend was observed. in fact, the largest enrichments were seen in studies using a single selection criterion .

when divided by type of experiment, only one of eight parental comparisons revealed enrichment for candidate genes. this is not unexpected, given that the test was performed not on qtg but only on positional candidates. furthermore, inbred strains can present genome-wide genetic divergence that is not related to the specific phenotype under study. this limitation of the parental design can be alleviated with the comparison of extremes, where animals are specifically selected for the phenotype of interest and regions not harboring qtl are expected to segregate randomly relative to the phenotype. the extremes design is the gene expression equivalent of mapping by allelic association where marker genotype frequencies are compared instead  <cit> . in both types of comparison, the degree to which differences between extremes are informative about an underlying association with the phenotype depends on the population and sample sizes, range of linkage disequilibrium , and population history and structure; therefore, proper experimental design is required to avoid spurious associations  <cit> . of two studies reviewed of this type, one presented significant enrichment. however, the one that showed significance used a modified design where the two extreme groups were composed of one parental strain and one recombinant inbred line  <cit> . because of the confounding of two designs, i.e., parental and extremes, and its small sample size , no further interpretation of this result is attempted. in contrast, the congenic design was implemented in  <dig> studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis. of these, five studies revealed enrichment for candidate genes. by design, only regions that are confirmed to harbor qtl have genetic divergence, and therefore enrichment of qtl candidates can be expected. however, multiple factors can potentially contribute to this trend. polymorphic genomic regions are more likely to host pqtl for any trait and to generate allelic bias in probe binding for one strain versus the other. this situation can be expected in cases where the microarray has been designed for one of the strains that are being compared, or for a strain that is genetically more closely related to one of them. allelic bias of probe binding will have a systematic effect on fluorescence intensity levels, which can be interpreted as differential gene expression. since higher polymorphism rate is expected to increase both frequency of qtl as well as allelic bias of probe signals, the variables would be associated and the observed overrepresentation of pqtl candidates may result from such confounding effect. both hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, since in reality qtl regions may be enriched for both polymorphisms that produce allelic bias as well as for functional polymorphisms that produce differential expression. however, it is important to assess the relative importance of these two factors in the apparent tendency for some qtl/microarray experiments to report pqtl candidates as differentially expressed.

meta-analysis of results from the literature presents several limitations. overrepresentation of pqtl candidates can be affected by a number of factors, such as publication bias for genes that are functional candidates or that are located near pqtl and inaccurate estimation of the gene coverage in microarrays. the number of candidate genes that were targeted by each microarray was largely unknown and the two reference sets used, i.e., total number of genes in the genome and number probes in the microarray, may not be optimum reference sets for overrepresentation tests. furthermore, heterogeneity in quality of microarray annotation, definition of candidate region limits, and statistical procedures for data processing and differential expression testing limit our ability to investigate the specific causes of enrichment for pqtl candidates in their results. therefore, an in-house microarray experiment was deemed necessary to specifically test for overrepresentation of candidate genes among differentially expressed genes. this gave us complete control over all these variables and allowed performing more specific tests that considered probe mismatches, ibd regions, and qtl location within congenic donor regions.

experiment using three congenic strains
differential expression between three cast.c <dig> hg-/- mouse congenic strains with their genotypic background controls c <dig> hg-/- was tested on the illumina mouse- <dig> microarray with samples from brain, liver, and gonadal white adipose tissue . this platform has coverage for  <dig> % of  <dig>  entrezgenes in the mm <dig> genome assembly and for  <dig> % of entrezgenes in the donor region of the congenic strains. differential expression analysis detected a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes  genome-wide that were affected by allelic variants of genes in the congenic region of hg2d, hg <dig>  and hg <dig>  respectively. of these,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were located within the donor regions of those strains. probes selected within the donor regions presented an allelic bias toward higher intensity of the c <dig> samples . since the reference mouse genome sequence used to design the microarray probes is c <dig>  polymorphisms between this strain and cast may have an effect on the binding affinity of microarray probes. a total of  <dig> probes overlapped at least one of the  <dig>  known or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms  within the limits of the donor regions . of these,  <dig> probes detected a transcript in at least one tissue. this is in agreement with an observed bias toward higher intensity from c <dig> alleles in probes with known or imputed snp . however, allelic bias for genes in the donor region persisted even after these probes were removed , suggesting that many snp between c <dig> and cast may still be unknown. however, it is also possible that the allelic bias is reflecting functional polymorphisms that can be detected in only one direction. for instance, insertions in the cast genome would not be detected, whereas insertions in the c <dig> genome are detected as deletions in the cast genome. likewise, nonsense mutations causing rna decay will only be apparent in cast, since probes were designed for c <dig> mrna molecules. on the basis of these findings, we recommend the use of high-density microarrays that target mrna molecules in multiple locations, and custom probeset definitions can be designed to target only perfect matching sequence in the particular cross under study. the absence of this or alternative techniques  <cit>  in all the reviewed papers leads us to conclude that such probe-binding artifacts also explain, at least in part, the increased frequency of candidate genes among reported differentially expressed genes.

differential expression testing reduced the number of positional candidates from  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes, that is, a reduction in  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, for hg2d, hg <dig>  and hg <dig>  respectively. however, these apparently high filtering rates result not only from lack of differential expression but also from lack of expression, removal of probe due to snp, and lack of coverage of the microarray. because untested genes cannot be discarded as candidates, genes that were targeted only by snp-overlapping probes or not targeted at all in the microarray must be added back to the list of potential candidates. these represent 29%,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of genes in the chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> donor regions, which were excluded from differential expression testing. the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed genes plus the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes that were not tested leaves a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes that would need further testing in each of the h2d, hg <dig>  and hg <dig> congenic regions. the effective reduction of candidates by differential expression testing after adjustment was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, i.e., 64% on average.

all differentially expressed genes located outside donor regions can be considered under trans regulation, in other words, trans-eqtl modulated. genes regulated in trans were observed in almost every chromosome in the genome . differentially expressed genes within the congenic regions are candidates for cis-eqtl regulation and represented  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of selected genes, which is highly unlikely by chance considering that only  <dig> %, 4%, and  <dig> % of genes in the array are located in each of these regions  for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. this high cis-eqtl enrichment was observed despite the fact that probes overlapping known snp between cast and c <dig> genomes were removed. furthermore, some genes classified as trans regulated lay right at the ends of the congenic regions and are most likely cis regulated . this is expected because the limits for the donor regions used here represent minimum intervals from low-density genotyping  <cit> , and the true limits may extend further than these intervals. we observed an approximate  <dig>  to  <dig> ratio between cis and trans eqtl. it has been argued that selection acts distinctively on cis eqtl owing to quantitative effects, limited pleiotropy, and more exposure to selective pressure due to codominant effects versus a recessive mode of action characteristic of trans regulation  <cit> . therefore, cis eqtl could have a predominant role in shaping genetic regulation of transcription  <cit> . however, empirical evidence compiled from gg studies in multiples species favors the view that trans eqtl are prevalent but show smaller effects than cis eqtl and can be missed at low sample sizes  <cit> . although statistical issues related to multiple testing of trans eqtl and power to detect smaller effects makes it difficult to estimate the true ratio of cis versus trans regulatory loci  <cit> , eqtl studies in yeast  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit>  have shown that expression of most transcripts is most likely regulated by multiple loci, and a study in humans showed significant enrichment of interaction among multiple loci affecting gene expression  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that the ratio observed here is due to the small experimental design with only four replicates per genotype and that the overrepresentation of candidates' genes in congenic qtl/microarray experiments may result from biased detection of cis eqtl as a consequence of low power  <cit> .

f <dig> offspring subcongenics from three congenic strains have been assayed for the same set of biometric measurements  resulting in identification of at least  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> qtl on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively  <cit>  . the large number and overlap of qtl intervals would make it impossible to test for co-localization between differentially expressed genes and qtl. instead, we tested whether the probability of differential expression was homogeneous along donor regions, conditioned on the number of expressed genes in bins of  <dig> mb. a fisher's exact test  revealed no significant departure from homogeneity for chromosome  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig> . inspection of figure  <dig> shows that the fraction of differentially expressed genes closely follows the distribution of genes in the donor regions . these results indicate that the distribution of selected genes within donor regions was mostly explained by the number of expressed genes and is not concentrated in any particular qtl region.

cis eqtl have been reported to be located preferentially in non-ibd regions  <cit> , and their regulated genes have higher density of predicted snp on transcription binding sites  <cit> . therefore, multiple authors have proposed using the ibd status of genes to filter or prioritize cis eqtl candidates  <cit> . we tested whether genetic diversity within congenic regions was associated with differential expression. high genomic divergence between c <dig> and cast resulted in only  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the genes in donor regions of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, to be located within ibd blocks. using the ibd criteria discarded only  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes from  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cis eqtl candidates in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. overrepresentation of differentially expressed genes within non-ibd blocks was observed only in chromosome  <dig>  but not in chromosomes  <dig>  or  <dig> . therefore, although cis eqtl candidates were preferentially located in non-ibd regions in agreement with doss et al.  <cit> , this was not significant once the probability of any gene to be located in ibd blocks is taken into account in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  this indicates that in this cross of highly divergent strains, enrichment of cis eqtls in these two chromosomes was driven only by the overall higher rate of genes in those regions. this added to the limited number of genes that would be removed from the candidate list by the ibd criterion indicates that there would be no real gain in using this approach. because we are inspecting only the chromosomes in one cross, we refrain from generalizing this conclusion to other cases. however, there are four main reason why using ibd to filter down lists of cis eqtl candidates should be done with care. in most cases, ibd is inferred from incomplete genotype data originated from resequencing  <cit> , genotype imputation  <cit> , or microarray genotyping for snp discovered by the previous two methods  <cit> . errors or lack of coverage from these methods could lead to imprecision in defining the size of ibd blocks that leads to filtering  of genes that are actually non-ibd. second, mutations that arose after the split of strain ancestors are missed from imputation techniques on the basis of a few highly divergent strains. third, in the absence of evidence that the strain ancestors were homozygous at all loci, it is possible that modern strains have fixed different alleles of functional snp that existed as heterozygous snp in the strain ancestors. fourth, enhancers in non-ibd regions may regulate expression of genes that are in ibd. we are aware of a least one case where this would have eliminated the causal gene if the ibd criterion were used. prcp was identified as a candidate gene for obesity by subcongenic isolation and gene expression data from brain  <cit> . this gene is located in an ibd region between the donor strains balb/cbyj and the background strain c57bl/6byj. however, in vitro assays with recombinant prcp demonstrated that it has enzymatic activity to inactivate Î±-melanocyte-stimulating hormone  by removing the c-terminal amino acid to produce Î±-msh1- <dig>  Î±-msh1- <dig>  a critical anorexigenic neuromodulator in the hypothalamus. a mouse model with a gene trap in prcp confirmed effects of prcp on obesity. in addition, inhibiting prcp activity in vivo decreased food intake, confirming the role of prcp in weight maintenance via control of active Î±-msh1- <dig> levels  <cit> . sequencing of this gene in the congenic revealed no snp in the expressed sequence but only a promoter câ†’t transition that is hypothesized to affect the observed changes in gene expression and protein activity, food intake, and obesity phenotypes. this snp was not known at that time and could not be inferred from the parental strains' ancestry. therefore, identity by descent does not imply lack of dna polymorphisms and, more important, of genetic differences that affect phenotypes.

in summary, differential expression testing in three congenic strains revealed expression signatures enriched for eqtl candidates, which resulted in hundreds of genes to be considered for further testing. expression differences within the donor regions were distributed according to the overall distribution of genes in those regions and were affected by ibd blocks only on chromosome  <dig>  high genetic divergence between c <dig> and cast resulted in very limited number and size of ibd regions. filtering by ibd would only discard  <dig> genes, which according to previous reports may well contain a causal variant. intense phenotyping of f <dig> fine mapping populations revealed high genetic complexity, with multiple qtl, in each of these regions. the hg2d congenic includes multiple qtl for the same phenotype  with opposite genotype effects  <cit> . furthermore, it is possible that many more qtl would be detected in these genomic regions if more phenotypes were collected. from the current data, it is impossible to distinguish between long-reaching linkage and pleiotropy or to infer causal relationships between qtl, transcripts, and organismal phenotypes. phenotyping of large mapping populations would be necessary to break the association between these confounding effects.

the results from our literature review and the present experiment do not invalidate the use of microarrays for dissecting qtl. on the contrary, they stress the need for new approaches to make better use of these data. it has been shown that reanalyzing large repositories of microarray data can identify profiles of differential expression that are highly predictive of gene associations to human diseases  <cit> . by ranking genes by the ratio of experiments showing differential expression across many conditions, chen et al.  <cit>  were able to rediscover disease genes with 79% specificity and 37% sensitivity and proposed using this criterion to prioritize candidates resulting from gwas associations. more recently, gorlov et al.  <cit>  found that the top genes by differential expression between normal and cancer tissue from human prostate are enriched for the same functional categories as the top candidate genes in gwas and that strength of association in both tests was correlated. a similar approach could be employed in model organisms by reanalyzing results from a large number of microarray studies in inbred and congenic strains to increase both power and significance of genotype-phenotype associations. one could prioritize genes that are repeatedly differentially expressed between mouse genotypes that show similar phenotypic differences. furthermore, such an approach would benefit from the availability of dense maps of snp by using modern statistical tools to associate phenotypes to haplotypes produced by historical recombinations while accounting for genetic background and population structure  <cit> . results from such analysis could be used to confirm and refine the position of eqtl from gg studies using f <dig> or backcrosses.

using meta-analysis of large collections of microarray data to prioritize qtl candidates in rodents can present several advantages over similar approaches in humans. linkage disequilibrium  in humans can extend large distances; it is affected by population structure and history and can even reach across multiple chromosomes . the situation is further complicated in case control designs where environmental factors significantly contribute to variation in gene expression  <cit> . in addition, technical factors such as time of preparation of samples for different populations have been proposed to explain some of the wide range of differences in gene expression observed between hapmap populations  <cit> . environmental factors can be more tightly controlled in experimental populations, although differences between laboratories do have a significant effect on microarray results and must be considered  <cit> . population structure is also present in laboratory mouse strains, and the contribution of different lines of ancestry is unequal across different regions of the genome  <cit> , which would affect analyses of expression data across multiple strains. however, new populations can be designed to remove the effects of population structure. one population of note is the collaborative cross  <cit> , which promises to greatly reduce ld and population structure , and since it will be a panel of recombinant inbred strains, a large volume of phenotype and gene expression data is expected to accumulate over time. we think that these resources and the development of better methods for data analysis will greatly improve the success of using microarray data to dissect complex traits in rodents.

CONCLUSIONS
a review of  <dig> studies from the literature that have applied the qtl/microarray showed that this approach is effective in reducing the list of candidate genes, with an average proportion of  <dig> % candidate genes being differentially expressed across experiments. however, a meta-analysis of published results showed no significant overrepresentation of positional candidate genes among those selected in 70% of the studies. most of the studies that did show enrichment of candidates were comparisons between congenic and background strains. lack of standards in analytical methods for testing differential expression testing as well as a tendency to apply multiple criteria for probe selection was observed. our analysis showed that no increase in enrichment is gained from this technique. in three reviewed studies, filtering by differential expression led to the identification of a qtg gene, where only a couple of genes were reported to be differentially expressed  <cit> . however, other studies with similar filtering ratios did not have such a favorable outcome , and therefore luck played a role in determining the outcome in these studies.

by performing three independent congenic microarray experiments, we found high enrichment of genes within donor regions among differentially expressed genes. within the limits of the donor regions, no clustering of differentially expressed genes to any particular pqtl region was observed, but a rather homogeneous distribution once overall gene density is accounted for. the high genetic divergence between c <dig> and cast caused only ~6-15% of genes in the donor regions to fall in ibd blocks and genes within these blocks were less likely to be differentially expressed on chromosome  <dig> but not on chromosomes  <dig> or  <dig>  on the basis of this and previous findings, ibd was not used to filter candidate genes. furthermore, lack of genome coverage from the microarray used and removal of probes overlapping snp excluded ~30% of positional candidates from differential expression testing. overall, differential expression testing resulted in a reduction of the number of candidates by ~60-70%, leaving ~300- <dig> genes per donor region that need further testing. therefore, our power to refine lists of candidate genes within donor regions from microarray data was rather poor. in addition, small sample size in our experiment restricted identification of trans eqtl. we expect that the same is true in the reviewed studies, contributing to the overrepresentation of pqtl candidates in some of them, resulting in a large number of candidates and making experimental validation impractical.

we showed that cis eqtl can be uninformative about qtg because they can show allelic bias toward higher expression of the reference genome. in our data, we found that this bias was partially explained by snp on the binding region of probes, but that lack of full sequence of the cast genome at the time of our analysis did not allow complete removal of this effect. even with the availability of full cast genome sequence, the limited number of probes in the platform used restricts the possibility of eliminating all probes matching snp.
