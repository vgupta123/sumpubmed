BACKGROUND
studies of natural microbial communities have long been impeded by the fact that only a small fraction of microorganisms could be cultured on selective media. fluorescent in situ hybridization  allows one to visualize microorganisms and infer their spatio-temporal interactions directly in the native sample without having to employ cultivation, which strongly underestimates the diversity . over the last decades fish has been used to study microbial communities of oceanic plankton and benthos, coral reefs and deep-sea vents, wastewater, activated sludge, and freshwater sediments . however, in russia, only a few microbial communities of some large freshwater and brackish water reservoirs  have been studied using this method .

the small territory of the kulunda and baraba steppes in southern west siberia abounds in shallow saline lakes, which are commonly closed basins. the area is a hilly terrain, and this topography spreads as far as the present arctic seas being produced either by wind erosion  <cit>  or by tectonic uplift  <cit> .

in the geological past, the territory was covered by the west siberian inland sea extending in the n—s direction from present kazakhstan to the arctic basin . it formed in the early selandian  and repeatedly lost connection with the arctic ocean since the lutetian, though the water system included w—e straits linking the inland and margin seas of the northern perithetys and atlantic oceans . in bartonian-priabonian time, the west siberian and arctic basins became totally separated. the sea retreated from the west siberian plate at the eocene-oligocene boundary, i.e., about  <dig>  ma. younger rocks in the area are continental lacustrine, lacustrine-fluvial, bog, and aeolian sediments  <cit> .fig.  <dig> location map of saline lakes. blue lines in the top panel show reconstructed limits of the west siberian sea in different stages of the palaeogene  <cit> : latest selandian-early thanetian , late thanetian–ypresian , lutetian , and bartonian-priabonian . the panel below shows simplified geology.  <dig> pre-quaternary clay silt, clay, and loess, including those building the hills;  <dig>  lower-middle pleistocene lacustrine-fluvial clay silt, or less often silt and sand  and loess and lake sand, silt, and clay silt ;  <dig> middle-upper pleistocene lacustrine and fluvial sand, silt, clay silt, often muddy; 5– <dig> upper pleistocene-holocene lacustrine clay silt , silt, and sand , alluvium and slope wash , and lacustrine-bog peat, muddy clay silt, and sapropel ;  <dig> freshwater  and saline  lakes;  <dig> sampling sites



the novosibirsk region which includes parts of kulunda and baraba steppes contains many saline and brackish lakes. its climate is strongly continental. vegetation period is characterized by a great amount of heat and sunlight. maximum temperatures range from 40 °c to−50 °c. annual precipitation is low, about 230–250 mm, 50–70 mm of them as snow. warm period account for up to 70 % of precipitation  <cit> .

most lakes in this region are very small and are characterized by short vegetation periods, high seasonal changes and waterline fluctuations, and frequent desiccations . these lakes are highly unstable systems so microbial communities must have metabolic and behavioral adaptations to cope with the fluctuations of various environmental factors .

there are many studies of microbial communities of saline lakes of many regions . these studies demonstrated that microbial communities of continental saline lakes are mostly represented by green algae, archaea, and bacteria  <cit> . there are some studies on physical-chemical parameters of water, planktonic algo-and zoocenoses, aerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacteria, organic matter, and phototrophic communities of saline lakes of the kulunda and baraba steppes . however, nothing is currently known about microbial composition of saline lakes of the novosibirsk region and its dependence on geochemical parameters.

there are some data on the impact of physical-chemical parameters on the structure of microbial communities  which suggest that community composition is affected by environmental and spatial factors, such as salinity, chlorophyll a concentration, water color, wind, precipitation, solar radiation, temperature, conductivity, and dissolved organic carbon .

we attempted to find the key environmental factor affecting the composition of microbial communities of the novosibirsk region. we hypothesized that salinity  is the crucial variable defining the composition of microbial communities.

in this connection, it is important to determine the composition of microbial communities of water and microbial mats of saline lakes of the novosibirsk region, and to study the impact of geochemical parameters on these communities.

our aim was to study the structure of microbial communities of saline lakes of the novosibirsk region using fluorescent in situ hybridization and microscopy, as well as the effect of physical-chemical parameters of waters on microbial communities of these lakes using principal components analysis and two-block partial least squares.

the results of this study reveal the statistically significant relationships between the quantities of organisms belonging to various phylogenetic groups and physical-chemical parameters. we suggest that the structure of microbial communities of saline lakes of the novosibirsk region is determined by physical-chemical parameters of waters, most significantly by salinity . generally changes in salinity resulted in changes of total plankton quantity, as well as in the ratios of the main phylogenetic groups: archaea, bacteria, algae, and cyanobacteria. in the majority of cases the increase in absolute and relative quantities of archaea was observed.

RESULTS
we studied  <dig> saline lakes located in the south of the novosibirsk region . depth, area, and water temperature in saline lakes of the novosibirsk region vary depending on the weather. table  <dig> lists maximum depths and average areas of the lakes; water temperature was 20–25 °c when samples were taken. bottom sediments of the studied lakes were represented by black or blue-gray silt with the smell of hydrogen sulfide, suggesting high content of organic matter. banks were mildly sloping, covered with herbaceous vegetation. bank edges and silt were often covered with a salt crust; rosy-brown film of artemia sp. was sometimes found.table  <dig> sampling locations, dates and environmental variables



physical-chemical parameters of waters
it should be noted that  <dig> of the  <dig> saline lakes studied  had extremely high concentration of nacl in the water . in this case the task to measure the physical-chemical parameters of water becomes non-trivial. high analysis errors were due to the interfering effect of na+ and cl− ions on the ion-selective electrodes as well as the multiple dilution of water for the analysis  <cit> . therefore before the study we performed special work to define the accuracy of the methods used on the example of the water of lake gorkoye . thus in table  <dig> all values with only significant digits and estimated analytic method errors are shown. the waters of studied lakes had a similar ratio of the main cations. thus, sodium and magnesium were predominant cations, the na/mg-ratio varies in the narrow range  regardless of salinity. the lakes could be attributed to two types based on their anions content: chloride and chloride-sulfate ones. the waters were weak alkaline with ph values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the highest рН value equal to  <dig>  was observed for khoroshee lake  in  <dig>  the measured eh values ranging from  <dig> to 420 v indicate that the waters of the lakes were saturated by oxygen. the lowest eh values  were observed in lakes gorkoye  in  <dig>  presny prud  in  <dig> and  <dig>  and gorkoye  in  <dig>  the significant variation in salinity value was observed depending on a water type. for example, gorkoye  and krugloye  lakes had strong brines, and their salinity levels varied in 210–290 g l− <dig>  lake gorkoye  has an intermediate brine; . while salinity value of lake razboynoye  was ten times lower, wherefore it belonged to the weak brines.table  <dig> the physical-chemical parameters of the waters: ph, eh, salinity and ions content in lakes

most chloride-sulfate lakes had strong brines and with salinity ranging from  <dig> to 250 g l− <dig>  these lakes resemble each other in some aspects. lake dolgoye  had a weak brine . presny prud  had the lowest salinity with salinity value equal  <dig>  g l− <dig>  the highest percentage of hydrocarbonate was observed for the least saline waters.

a comparison of the data obtained in  <dig> and in  <dig> does not show the considerable changes in the most of waters physical-chemical parameters. however, we should mention the noticeable increase of the salinity for chloride lakes in  <dig>  while salinity values of chloride-sulfate lakes significantly decreased. these data correlate with the increase of chloride content in the former and its decrease in the latter, as well as with the decrease of sulfate and sodium content in all the lakes, while nitrate and potassium content increased. no significant changes were observed for other parameters. we observed a noticeable difference of the water samples of  <dig> and  <dig> taken from three lakes. lake khorosheye  and lake solenoye  had significantly lower salinity in  <dig>  while the ion content was shifted from sulfate-chloride to predominantly chloride. this was especially pronounced for lake khoroshye , where salinity decreased  <dig>  times and sulfate content changed from 65 g l− <dig> in  <dig> to  <dig>  g l− <dig> in  <dig>  salinity of presny prud  remained the same, while sulfate content increased two times. no changes were observed in magnesium and sodium content.

dominating microbial communities
during our fieldwork, we noticed that the littoral zone of some lakes contains microbial communities visible to the naked eye. the littoral zone of the lakes gorkoye  and solenoye  is covered by loose granular dark green and yellow-green communities with whitish and purple inclusions, which are inhabited by large numbers of artemia sp. the communities from these two lakes were similar in appearance and content despite the fact that they are located far from each other and have different salinity. according to the microscopic analysis, these loose mats were aggregates of the cyanobacteria aphanocapsa sp., gloeocapsa sp., and microcystis sp. with inclusions of many diatom algae.

microscopic analysis of microbial mats found an underlayer of salt and sand in the littoral zones of the lakes dolgoye , krugloye , and khorosheye  demonstrating that these mats are dominated by the filamentous cyanobacteria scytonema sp.

in the littoral zone of lake dolgoye  mats of filamentous green algae underlayed by rosy layers of purple bacteria resembling thiocapsa were found in addition to sandy mats. characteristics of the main microbial communities are given in table  <dig> table  <dig> types of shoreline microbial communities observed in the studied lakes



structure of planktonic microbial communities
the spatial and temporal organization of planktonic microbial communities of  <dig> lakes was studied using fluorescent in situ hybridization and microscopy. we determined total quantities of archaea, bacteria, cyanobacteria, and algae. so, for archaea and bacteria, populations varied from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells ml− <dig>  and from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells ml− <dig>  respectively. algae and cyanobacteria were from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells ml− <dig>  in general, the total quantity of microorganisms in the water samples from the lakes ranged from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells ml− <dig> 

in  <dig>  a maximum value for the total quantity of microorganisms  was observed in  <dig> in lake khorosheye  with salinity at 240 g l− <dig>  a high quantity  was also observed in lake gorkoye  at 290 g l− <dig>  we should note that the high levels of microorganisms were caused by a high quantity of archaea. archaea represented  <dig>  % of the total quantity of microorganisms .fig.  <dig> quantities of main phylogenetic groups in plankton in the studied lakes, salinity and ph. a relative abundance of archaea, bacteria, algae and cyanobacteria. b salinity and ph profiles



a maximum quantity of bacteria  was observed in lake gorkoye  with salinity of 150 g l− <dig>  and a high quantity of bacteria  was also found with salinity of 12 g l− <dig> ) and 290 g l− <dig> ), respectively. the quantity of algae and cyanobacteria  was generally an order of magnitude lower than bacteria. relatively high percentage of algae and cyanobacterial was observed in lake presny prud , lake krugloye , and lake solenoye  . the highest abundance  of algae and cyanobacteria was observed in lakes gorkoye  -  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells ml− <dig>  khorosheye - <dig>  ×  <dig> cells ml− <dig>  and gorkoye - <dig>  ×  <dig> cells ml− <dig>  and were mainly caused by an extensive growth of halophylic algae  that were detected using microscopy.

on the whole, archaea dominated in  <dig> of the  <dig> samples in  <dig>  making up over 70 % of the total cell number. in two cases bacteria dominated, making up 98 % and 77 % of the cells. the percentage of algae and cyanobacteria was only  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively . however, they made a high contribution to the biomass production and ecosystem functioning due to their high biomass. for example, in lake gorkoye , an average size of an algal cell was 500 μm <dig>  while for an average bacterial cell it was only 5 μm <dig>  and for an average archaeal cell, it was less than 1 μm <dig>  we should also note that archaea formed mucous microcolonies with small indiscernible cells in these communities.

in some cases we observed microcolonies of small bacterial and archaeal cells, which grew together, and areas where bacterial and archaeal probes overlapped.

in  <dig>  the maximum quantity of archaea  was detected in lake krugloye  along with the highest salinity, 290 g l− <dig>  one of the highest bacterial densities  was also observed in this lake. in  <dig>  the decrease of salinity was accompanied by a decrease in all groups of microorganisms . the only exception was in lake dolgoye , where high quantities of archaea , bacteria , algae, and cyanobacteria  were observed at low salinity levels . the adjacent lakes dolgoye  and krugloye , which differ significantly in physical-chemical and microbiological parameters, stress the unique nature of the lakes studied in the region.

on the whole, the proportion of bacteria was higher in  <dig>  archaea dominated only in one sample with a high salinity . the percentage of algal and cyanobacterial cells was negligible.

of the total  <dig> water samples , archaea and bacteria dominated in nine communities, the former ones usually dominated at higher salinity values . the maximum percentage of archaea  was observed at the salinity level of 280–290 g l− <dig>  while a high percentage of bacteria  was found at lower salinity values,  <dig> to 190 g l− <dig>  algae and cyanobacteria never dominated any planktonic communities. a rather high percentage of algae and cyanobacteria  was found in lake solenoye , due to a considerable proportion of aphanocapsa sp., gloeocapsa sp., and microcystis sp. colonial cyanobacteria, as well as in presny prud  , which harboured many green protococcous algae. in all other cases it did not exceed 4 %, and was usually below 1 %.

correlation of plankton abundance and environmental factors
the physical-chemical parameters of water from the lakes and the data on the number of archaea, bacteria, algae and cyanobacteria, and the total number of microorganisms were used as the initial data. abundance and environmental parameters make high contributions to both components, which indicate that there is a relationship between these variables.

three principal components were selected for analysis. together they explain  <dig>  % of the observed variation. the first principal component explains  <dig>  % of the observed variability. the salinity  and cl, so42−, no3−, na+, К+, mg2+ ion contents  have positive correlation with this component. ph was in antiphase  .table  <dig> correlation coefficients with their significances between the principal components and bacterial and environmental parameters

for each parameter were calculated the correlation coefficient  and statistical significance ; lga-logarithm of the number of archaea, lgb-logarithm of the number of bacteria, lgalg-logarithm of the number of algae and cyanobacteria, lgs-logarithm of the total population



the second component explained  <dig>  % of the observed variability. the logarithm of the number of bacteria , the logarithm of the total population , the logarithm of the number of archaea  and the content of no3− mainly contribute to this component . the third component explained  <dig>  % of the observed variability. it had a positive correlation with the content of ca2+  and a negative correlation with the logarithms of the number of algae and cyanobacteria , archaea  and total population  .

interannual specificity was shown by the second principal component. an exception was the freshwater lake presny prud  , located in the area studied in  <dig>  perhaps the reason for this was a very low content of nitrates in the water in  <dig>  which was closer to the average content of nitrates in the water of the lakes in  <dig> than it was to the average content of nitrates in the water of the lakes in  <dig> 

the greatest differences in the third principal component were detected in lake khorosheye , possibly, due to the higher order of ca2+ in the water in  <dig> 

therefore, to identify a clear relationship between the biological and physicochemical components of the ecosystem, we used the 2b-pls method. analysis by the 2b-pls method showed that  <dig>  % of the total covariance are accounted for by the first two datasets, or blocks.  <dig>  % were accounted for by the first couple of datasets,  <dig>  %-for the second pair, and less than 4 % of the covariance were accounted for by the remaining  <dig> pairs of datasets. for the first pair of datasets, the correlation coefficient was  <dig>  , for the second pair  <dig>  .

b <dig> is a salinity  datasets, b <dig> is datasets of microbial abundance . lakes with high salinity and relatively high abundance of algae and cyanobacteria represent one group of lakes. another group of lakes was characterized by a relatively high ph, high abundance of archaea, bacteria, a total number and a certain ratio of mg/na .fig.  <dig> results of the data analysis by the method 2b-pls on first pair of datasets. results of the data analysis on the quantity of different groups of microorganisms and factors potentially affecting. the b1: axis 1-salinity datasets, the b2: axis 1-datasets of microbial abundance. a blue circles-2008; red squares-2009; 41–51-lakes. b symbols : lga-logarithm of the number of archaea, lgb-logarithm of the number of bacteria, lgalg-logarithm of the number of algae and cyanobacteria, lgs-logarithm of the total population; a-number of archaea, b-number of bacteria, alg-number of algae and cyanobacteria, s-total number of microorganisms, tds-salinity

a second two datasets, or blocks clearly showed an interannual aspect . it is evident that the lakes in  <dig> had a high content of sulfates, high salinity and abundance of algae and cyanobacteria, and in  <dig> the number of bacteria, archaea, and total quantity was greater. minimum distances characterizing the differences in the first pair datasets were intrinsic to the lakes presny prud , razboynoye , gorkoye  and solenoye , the maximum distances–to the krugloye  and khorosheye  lakes. minimum distances characterizing the differences on the second pair of datasets were intrinsic to the lakes presny prud  and razboynoye , the maximum distances-to the lakes krugloye , khorosheye , and solenoye .

in general, the greatest interannual changes were intrinsic of the lakes krugloye  and khorosheye , possibly due to significant fluctuations in salinity and other physical-chemical parameters as well as to an abrupt change in the quantity of bacteria and archaea over different years. the lowest interannual changes were intrinsic to the lakes with more freshwater, presny prud  and razboynoye . significant fluctuations in the quantity were also been observed for these lakes, while physical-chemical parameters were more stable.

the application of the 2b-pls method in this case was completely acceptable because the dependency on salinity and abundance of microorganisms was observed in the first two datasets. and the dependence on the clear interannual variability was observed in the second two pairs of datasets.

discussion
the results of our study demonstrate that microbial communities of saline lakes of the novosibirsk region have considerable microbial diversity. the distribution of the different groups  in the lakes was highly heterogeneous. so, for archaea and bacteria, oscillations of populations were  <dig> orders of magnitude greater. archaea dominated in  <dig> of the  <dig> populations. algae and cyanobacteria were the lowest and the most consistent in quantity. the total cell frequencies and frequencies of the main phylogenetic groups are similar to those of other water ecosystems. thus, in the chemocline of lake shunet which has the salinity levels of 17–66 g l− <dig>  fish-tsa revealed  <dig> cells ml− <dig> of the total microbial numbers, the numbers of bacteria and archaea and in the chemocline of lake shira which has the salinity levels of 14–18 g l− <dig>  fish-tsa revealed  <dig> cells ml− <dig> of the total microbial numbers and  <dig> cells ml− <dig> per the numbers of bacteria and archaea  <cit> .

the water from the continental slope of the black sea contained  <dig> cells ml− <dig> of sulfate reducing bacteria as revealed by fish, and  <dig>  by dapi  <cit> . the delta of the selenga river harboured  <dig> cells ml− <dig> as was demonstrated by dapi  <cit> . there is no published information on microbial communities for the lakes in our region, but there are data on the numbers of anoxyphotobacteria that could reach  <dig> cells ml− <dig> on selective media  <cit> . our results do not conform to other studies of freshwater and soil microbial communities, which report lower numbers of cells detected by hybridization with bacterial and archaeal probes than those visualized by dapi staining  <cit> . however, in the case of highly saline ecosystems the abundance of archaeal-bacterial microcolony can be explained by protective mechanisms which include mutualistic growth and the synthesis of a common mucous matrix. the location of bacteria and archaea in such microcolony may be a sign of close interaction among these groups and an indicator of common metabolic pathways  <cit> .

filamentous algae and colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria dominated in the studied shoreline communities, which is characteristic for all saline lakes. however, we should note that lakes of the novosibirsk region are unique in the prevalence of cyanobacteria of the genera scytonema, and aphanocapsa, while in other regions, microcoleus chthonoplastes, halospirulina tapeticola, and aphanothece halophytica  <cit> , and phormidium or oscillatoria  <cit>  are usually dominant.

the obtained data on the physical-chemical parameters of water of eleven saline lakes of the novosibirsk region allowed us to estimate temporal changes in different lakes. we found the considerable changes in salinity and some other parameters, which is characteristic of small lakes in cryoarid regions  <cit> .

the data on physical-chemical parameters and the quantities of bacteria, archaea, algae, and cyanobacteria allowed us to employ statistical analyses to look for patterns of organism distribution.

some recent studies showed that environment is crucial in the formation of planktonic microbial communities, and that it is predominantly the local environment that regulates community composition  <cit> . for ninety-eight shallow lakes located in three european regions there is strong evidence that species sorting in response to local environmental factors is a key determinant of the taxon composition of aquatic bacterial communities over a very broad range of spatial scales. the main factors controlling bacterial community composition were resources  and grazing-related factors   <cit> . for six high altitude lakes in the mount everest region  community composition depended mostly on distance between these lakes, but certain local environmental factors were also significant in explaining this apparent biogeographic pattern  <cit> . multiple stepwise regression analysis for the zapadłe lake in north-eastern poland showed the following factors determined prokaryotic abundance: conductivity, tn, depth, temperature, fe, doc and norg , while conductivity, toc, h2s and po <dig> influenced prokaryotic biomass at r2 =  <dig>  . canonical correspondence analysis  indicated that conductivity, h2s, don, toc, doc, ntot, norg, nh <dig>  ptot, porg, po <dig>  and mn explained changes in bacterial community structures in june and september, while the most important measured factor in november was temperature  <cit> . for the intertidal coast of the río de la plata estuary  were found that the plankton community assemblage was significantly modified by high eutrophication levels along the intertidal southwest coast of the estuary  <cit> . the authors observed that high densities and biomasses of bacterioplankton, picophytoplankton , and microzooplankton  were positively related to highly eutrophic and polluted sites along the inner portion of the río de la plata estuary. in contrast, the biomasses of the microphytoplankton  and mesozooplankton  were positively correlated with the high turbidity and conductivity levels in the estuary’s outer and less polluted area. the biomass of picophytoplankton  and nanophytoplankton  was positively associated with the most polluted area characterized by high concentrations of p-po4− <dig> and n-nh4+ and the greatest bacterial density and biomass  <cit> .

for small lakes on the shore of the baltic sea, three variables  were found to have great impact on the composition of bacterial communities. there is a strong aspect of environmental determinism shaping aquatic microbial assemblages on a global scale, and environmental forces are acting singularly on different bacterial groups  <cit> . for two shallow alkaline pools in eastern austria bacterial and cyanobacterial numbers depend on abiotic parameters, such as wind, precipitation, solar radiation, and temperature  <cit> . impact of temperatures was confirmed for a soda lake in transbaikal region  <cit> . for five shallow soda lakes in eastern austria agitation, salinity, conductivity, and dissolved organic carbon were found to have the biggest impact on bacteria and cyanobacteria  <cit> . for saline lakes of mongolia, china, and argentina, bacterial distribution was found to depend on environmental  and spatial factors  <cit> . and for the sfax saltern  it was found that the salinity gradient had a considerable influence on the composition of the phytoplanktonic communities  <cit> .

therefore, there is a set of environmental factors, e.g. salinity, chlorophyll a concentration, water color, wind, precipitation, solar radiation, temperature, conductivity, and dissolved organic carbon, etc., that has an impact on microbial communities; relative impact of a factor depends on ecosystem type and location . however, in the case of our study we acknowledge that the first stage of our statistical analysis, the pca method is not a good method for identifying the relationship between the abundance of microorganisms and the environmental parameters in saline lakes of the novosibirsk region, because it is designed for describing sets of uniform characters and objects as it was made in  <cit> .

therefore, at the second stage of analysis we used the 2b-pls method, which allowed us to suggest that the structure of microbial communities in the studied lakes is determined by physical-chemical parameters, most significantly by salinity . thus, increase of salinity in microbial communities results in the increase of archaeal percentage, while decrease leads to increase in bacterial abundance. generally changes in salinity resulted in changes of total plankton quantity, as well as in the ratios of the main phylogenetic groups: archaea, bacteria, algae, and cyanobacteria. in the majority of cases the increase in absolute and relative quantities of archaea was observed. salinity is a factor that determines ionic strength of solutions. microorganisms can tolerate a wide range of salinity. changes in salinity level are compensated by ion pumps and na-h+ antiporters. these changes of internal solute potential require a significant amount of energy. as a result, a cell growing at a non-optimal modulator level may be at a competitive disadvantage in a given community. this may result in community change  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we detected high microbial richness in the communities of saline lakes of the novosibirsk region, and found the dominant species in the plankton and benthos communities. filamentous and colonial cyanobacteria of the genera scytonema, aphanocapsa, and/or filamentous algae dominated in littoral communities. spatial and temporal organization of planktonic microbial communities and the quantities of archaea, bacteria, algae, and cyanobacteria were investigated using fluorescent in situ hybridization and microscopy. we have found that the dominant planktonic component is represented by archaea, or, less frequently, by bacteria.

studies of the impact of environmental factors on microbial communities of saline lakes of the novosibirsk region allowed us to detect statistically significant relationships between the quantities of organisms belonging to various phylogenetic groups and physical-chemical parameters.

we found that salinity  is the main but not the only factor affecting community structure. generally changes in salinity resulted in changes of total plankton quantity, as well as in the ratios of the main phylogenetic groups: archaea, bacteria, algae, and cyanobacteria. in the majority of cases the increase in absolute and relative quantities of archaea was observed.

our study demonstrates that saline lakes in the novosibirsk region contain the unique microbial communities that may become a prolific source of microorganisms for fundamental and applied studies in various fields of ecology, microbiology, geochemistry, and biotechnology, and deserve further metagenomic investigation.
