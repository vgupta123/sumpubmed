BACKGROUND
kainic acid  is a powerful neurotoxic analog of glutamate that induces excitotoxic neuronal death in the hippocampus  <cit>  through the accumulation of multiple cellular stress responses  <cit> . mitochondria are cellular organelles that play a crucial role in atp energy production, calcium homeostasis, and inflammation in the central nervous system. mitochondrial dysfunction is found in many neurodegenerative diseases, and pathology is related to mitochondrial calcium overload, synaptic energy failure, inflammation, and oxidative stress  <cit> . mitochondrial dysfunction and structural damage have also been reported in epileptic seizures in humans and animal models .

mitochondria are highly dynamic structures that consistently change in size and shape. mitochondrial fission segregates dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation, and fusion results in the sharing of newly synthesized rna and proteins with pre-existing mitochondria to maintain healthy mitochondrial pools  <cit> . in neurons, mitochondrial fission facilitates movement of mitochondria to distal axons to supply atp energy for proper synaptic function and prevents neuronal atrophy  <cit> .

balancing the processes of fission and fusion controls the overall morphology and function of mitochondria, and numerous proteins that regulate fission and fusion have been reported  <cit> . dynamin-related protein  <dig>  is a central mitochondrial fission protein, recruited to fission sites on the outer mitochondrial membrane. loss of drp <dig> has been shown to deplete axonal mitochondria, which is followed by axonal energy failure and neuronal death  <cit> . when mitochondria are damaged, their membrane potential is reduced and drp1-mediated fission and apoptotic signals are stimulated  <cit> . mitochondrial division inhibitor- <dig>  was identified during chemical screening for mitochondrial division inhibitors; it selectively inhibits drp <dig> function by inhibiting drp <dig> self-assembly  <cit> . parkin, a ubiquitin-protein ligase, has been shown to regulate mitochondrial morphology, and loss-of-function parkin mutations produce enlarged or swollen mitochondria with suppressed drp1-mediated fission  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated drp <dig> function during ka-induced excitotoxicity by using mdivi- <dig> and suggest that inhibiting excessive mitochondrial fragmentation may have therapeutic benefit by protecting against neuronal death. we showed that mdivi- <dig> significantly reduced seizure activity and increased survival of ka-treated mice. by reducing parkin-mediated mitochondrial degradation, mdivi- <dig> may protect against mitochondrial functional failure and neuronal death.

RESULTS
mdivi- <dig> reduces seizure activity and increases survival of mice with ka-induced seizures
to determine whether mdivi- <dig> has an effect on ka-induced seizures and survival, we monitored seizure activity and survival rates for 2 h after ka injection . ka-treated  mice and mdivi-1-treated  mice showed different distributions in the frequency of behavioral seizure scores after ka injection ; the chi square calculated value  was greater than the chi square critical value  for p =  <dig> . mdivi- <dig> treatment reduced the frequency of seizure scores above  <dig> in ka-injected mice. the frequency of seizure scores 4– <dig> was  <dig>  in the ka mice, whereas the frequency was  <dig>  in the ka + m mice . the mortality rate was 35 %  in the ka mice and 12 %  in the ka + m mice after ka injection . these results thus showed that mdivi- <dig> reduces seizure activity and mortality in a mouse model of ka-induced seizures.fig.  <dig> mdivi- <dig> effects on ka-induced seizure activity, percent survival, and neuronal cell death. the frequency of behavioral seizure scores  and percent survival  were monitored during the first 2 h after ka treatment . c cresyl violet-stained brain sections showing pyramidal neurons in the ca <dig> regions. the brain sections were prepared at 24 h after ka injection. scale bar 200 µm



mdivi- <dig> attenuates neuronal cell death in the hippocampus after ka treatment
we subsequently used cresyl violet staining to examine whether mdivi- <dig> protects ka mice from seizure-induced neuronal death . ka mice exhibited significant hippocampal cell death; the thickness of pyramidal cells in the ca <dig> region was reduced, typical pyknotic nuclei were found, and in some cases, there was a complete loss of hippocampal cells . the number of neun-positive cells was counted in the ca <dig> regions of ctl, ka, ka + m, and m mice and ka mice showed ~60 % cell loss compared to ctl mice . however, these changes were only partial or significantly reduced in the hippocampus of ka + m mice. these results thereby showed that mdivi- <dig> attenuates ka-induced neuronal cell death.

mdivi- <dig> protects mitochondrial morphology in the hippocampus after ka treatment
since mdivi- <dig> is a mitochondrial fission inhibitor by regulating drp <dig>  we examined whether mdivi- <dig> pretreatment protects neuronal death by affecting mitochondrial morphology in ka mice. electron microscopy showed that ka induced significant changes in mitochondrial size and cristae structure . in ka-injected mice, the number of mitochondria was significantly reduced and the area and perimeter were heterogeneous- some larger mitochondria had fragmented or completely absent cristae structure; these changes were attenuated by mdivi- <dig> treatment .fig.  <dig> mdivi- <dig> effects on mitochondrial morphology in the mouse hippocampus 24 h after ka injection. representative electron microscopy images showing mitochondrial ultrastructure in the hippocampus of ctl, ka, ka + m, and m mice. asterisks indicate the mitochondria with disrupted cristae structures. scale bar 1 µm



to examine whether mdivi- <dig> pretreatment changed drp <dig> activity, the phosphorylation of drp <dig>  at ser <dig>  which is known to stimulate fission after phosphorylation  <cit> , was assessed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining analysis . the expression of p-drp <dig> was significantly increased in ka mice and reduced in ka + m mice . the intensity of p-drp <dig> immunofluorescence staining in the hippocampal ca <dig> region was increased  in ka mice compared to ctl mice and reversed after mdivi- <dig> pretreatment . we also found that ka increased the number of p-drp <dig> stained gabaergic interneurons in the hippocampal ca <dig> region  that may indicate the impaired balance between excitation and inhibition in ca <dig> neuronal circuitry  <cit> . these results thus suggest that mdivi- <dig> may block p-drp <dig> mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and reduce significant principal neuronal loss after ka and further alter gabaergic inhibitory interneurons.fig.  <dig> mdivi- <dig> effects on mitochondrial p-drp <dig> expression in the mouse hippocampus 24 h after ka injection. a western blots and quantitative protein analysis of p-drp <dig>  drp <dig>  and vdac <dig> in the hippocampal mitochondrial fractions from ctl, ka, and ka + m mice. densitometry values were normalized to drp <dig> and expressed as arbitrary units. data are shown as mean ± sem. *p <  <dig>  versus ctl. #

the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission is also regulated by the activity of fusion proteins. optic atrophy  <dig>  and mitofusin  are localized to the inner and outer membranes of the mitochondria, respectively, and both are required for fusion  <cit> . thus, we examined whether the expression of opa <dig> and mfn <dig> was altered in ka mice. western blot analysis showed that opa <dig> and mfn <dig> levels were similar among the groups of mice . in addition, there was no change in the expression of cyclophilin d , a matrix protein that modulates mitochondrial permeability transition pore  opening . these results thereby suggest that mdivi- <dig> regulates mitochondrial fission mainly by regulating drp <dig> activity through reduced ser <dig> phosphorylation to protect hippocampal neurons from ka-induced mitochondrial degradation and neuronal death.

effect of mdivi- <dig> on parkin and hsp <dig> expression in the hippocampus after ka treatment
to examine the effect of mdivi- <dig> on parkin recruitment to the mitochondria of ka mice, we performed western blot analysis. parkin is normally localized in the cytoplasm and selectively recruited to impaired mitochondria where it promotes mitochondrial degradation  <cit> . to examine the subcellular localization of parkin, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions were isolated and parkin levels were examined . mitochondrial parkin was induced by ka and significantly decreased by mdivi- <dig> pretreatment. next, we examined the mitochondrial expression of heat shock protein  <dig> , which is a stress sensor that translocates to damaged mitochondria and regulates parkin-mediated mitophagy  <cit> . mitochondrial hsp <dig> expression was significantly induced in ka mice, and mdivi- <dig> treatment reduced hsp <dig> levels .fig.  <dig> mdivi- <dig> effects on mitochondrial parkin and hsp <dig> expression in the mouse hippocampus 24 h after ka injection. western blots and quantitative protein analysis of parkin  and hsp <dig>  in the hippocampal mitochondrial fractions from ctl, ka, and ka + m mice. densitometry values were normalized to vdac <dig> and expressed as arbitrary units. data are shown as mean ± sem. *p <  <dig>  versus ctl. #

effects of mdivi- <dig> treatment on hippocampal cox- <dig> and iba- <dig> expression
to evaluate whether mdivi- <dig> treatment protects the hippocampus from ka-induced neuronal and glial inflammation, we examined expression of cox- <dig> and iba- <dig> in control , ka, and ka + m mice . the expression of cox- <dig> was dramatically increased in the hippocampal ca <dig> region of ka mice compared to the expression in ctl mice, and mdivi- <dig> pretreatment reduced neuronal cox- <dig> expression . moreover, we examined microglial activation by iba- <dig> expression in the hippocampus of ctl, ka, and ka + m mice. ka induced morphological changes in immune-responsive microglial cells and increased the number of activated microglial cells and the iba- <dig> expression levels, which were significantly reduced by mdivi- <dig> treatment . these results suggest that mdivi- <dig> protects the hippocampus from ka-induced inflammation by inhibiting mitochondrial fragmentation and subsequent dysfunction.fig.  <dig> mdivi- <dig> effects on cox- <dig> and iba- <dig> expression in the mouse hippocampus 24 h after ka injection. immunohistochemistry of cox- <dig>  and iba- <dig>  in the hippocampus of ctl, ka, ka + m, and m mice. the ca <dig> regions are indicated as dotted squares and shown magnified at the right. scale bar 200 µm



discussion
the present study showed that mdivi- <dig> pretreatment attenuates seizure activity and prevents ka-induced hippocampal cell death by reducing mitochondrial morphological changes, mitochondrial fission, and parkin-mediated degradation. we hypothesized that ka-induced excitotoxicity increases mitochondrial fission, leading to hippocampal neuronal death. we treated mice with a low dose of mdivi- <dig> before ka injection to examine whether mdivi- <dig> exhibited neuroprotective effects by modifying the mitochondrial stress response at an early stage of seizure pathology, and we demonstrated that mdivi- <dig> ultimately reduced neuroinflammation and neuronal death in the hippocampus of ka-injected mice.

we first showed that mdivi- <dig> pretreatment reduced seizure behaviors and increased mouse survival rates upon ka injection. neuronal death in the hippocampal ca <dig> region was also significantly reduced in mdivi- <dig> pretreated ka-injected mice. these findings are in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that mdivi- <dig> protects against hippocampal neuronal death in pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats  <cit> . since mdivi- <dig> is known to inhibit mitochondrial fission factor, drp <dig>  we further examined mitochondrial morphology via electron microscopy. the mitochondrial sizes were heterogeneous, and the mitochondrial inner and outer membrane structures were severely disrupted, suggesting that the mitochondrial membrane potential and other buffering functions of the mitochondria were impaired. recently, drp <dig> inhibition by mdivi- <dig> in traumatic and ischemic brain injury was shown to reduce morphological and functional changes in mitochondria, cell apoptosis, neurological deficits, and brain edema  <cit> .

here, we did not examine the chronic effect of mdivi- <dig> at the time longer than 24 h after ka injection. the chronic changes include limbic sclerosis, a massive neurodegeneration and spontaneous recurrent seizure that are frequently shown in the developed epilepsy such as human temporal lobe epilepsy . these changes are often studied at 7–8 weeks after status epilepticus  induction   <cit> , in that we may study the neuroprotective effect of mdivi- <dig> from ka-induced chronic changes. in addition, we showed only mitochondrial morphological changes by em analysis; however, we expect significant mitochondrial functional changes that can be accessed by a variety of experimental technologies which were limited in the current study. future study to understand mitochondrial functional outcomes of the mdivi- <dig> treatment would examine the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative stress, calcium levels, atp production, and oxidative phosphorylation.

mitochondrial fission is controlled in part by the phosphorylation of drp1; when phosphorylated at ser <dig>  drp <dig> stimulates mitochondrial fission  <cit> . we demonstrated that p-drp <dig> levels were significantly increased in mitochondria isolated from the hippocampus of ka-injected mice and in co-localized ca <dig> neurons in ka-injected mice, whereas mdivi- <dig> pretreatment inhibited the increase of p-drp <dig> expression. mitochondrial fission has been previously shown to promote apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial outer membrane permeability, and mdivi- <dig> was shown to block bax/bak-dependent cytochrome c release from mitochondria  <cit> . we also demonstrated that parkin recruitment to mitochondria isolated from the hippocampus of ka-injected mice was increased, whereas mdivi- <dig> inhibited this recruitment. parkin has been previously shown to be selectively recruited to damaged mitochondria with low membrane potential, and it plays a role in mediating mitochondrial degradation  <cit> . our results suggest that mdivi- <dig> prevents mitochondrial fission and parkin-mediated degradation in ka-injected mice.

hsp <dig> is a critical regulator of stress-induced parkin-mediated mitochondrial degradation, since hsp <dig> rapidly translocates to depolarized mitochondria prior to parkin recruitment. furthermore, impaired parkin action in hsp <dig> knockout mice has been associated with altered mitochondrial morphology and reduced mitochondrial function, suggesting that hsp <dig> may regulate mitochondrial quality control and have therapeutic benefit  <cit> . in our study, we showed that mdivi- <dig> inhibited the increase of hsp <dig> expression in mitochondria isolated from the hippocampus of ka-induced seizure mice, suggesting that mdivi- <dig> prevents parkin-mediated mitochondrial degradation.

based on our findings, we suggest that inhibition of excessive mitochondrial fission induced by ka injection may reduce the initial mitochondrial excitotoxic damage response and subsequent hippocampal neuronal death. our study was limited to examine the protein expression or mitochondrial changes at 24 h after ka injection and no data were provided on early time points when we may show the causal effect of initial mitochondrial changes on ka excitotoxcitiy following neuronal death in the hippocampus. we also examined changes in expression of opa <dig> and mfn <dig>  two mitochondrial proteins involved in the regulation of mitochondrial fusion, and cypd, which modulates opening of mptp  <cit> . we observed no changes in expression levels for any of these proteins upon ka injection or mdivi- <dig> pretreatment. thus, we assume that the dose of mdivi- <dig> administered to ka mice in the present study affected mitochondrial fission through drp <dig> and parkin-mediated mitophagy, but not through other mitochondrial regulatory factors in at least the time points we examined.

in a recent study, mdivi- <dig> showed a neuroprotective effect in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury , where mdivi- <dig> alleviated tbi-induced behavioral deficits and brain edema, and neuronal death. the underlying mechanism may be associated with reducing mitochondrial morphological changes, inhibiting mitochondrial fission, cytochrome c release and caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . in addition, stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α  was shown to be neuroprotective in ka-induced neuronal death by increasing anti-apoptotic protein and mitochondrial number and function of oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . these studies support that normalizing mitochondrial morphology and the number, and enhancing mitochondrial function by mdivi- <dig> are beneficial against neurodegenerative diseases.

during the study, we found that ka induced p-drp <dig> expression in gabaergic inhibitory neurons and mdivi- <dig> treatment reduced the level. we suggest that the p-drp1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction may alter inhibitory gabaergic neural transmission in ka mice and lead to chronic seizures by disrupting the balance between excitation and inhibition in ca <dig> neuronal circuitry  <cit> , which may be attenuated by mdivi- <dig> treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study, we demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of mdivi- <dig>  which supports the suggestion that correcting mitochondrial morphology may reduce the extent of neuroinflammation and neuronal death induced by seizures. the molecular mechanism of mdivi- <dig> involves attenuating mitochondrial fission through drp <dig> and hsp72/parkin-mediated mitochondrial degradation. mdivi- <dig> is a promising target for the treatment of seizures, strokes, other neurotoxic and/or ischemic damage, as well as neurodegenerative diseases.
