BACKGROUND
aging is a natural process that affects all organisms, although the precise mechanisms of its progression remain poorly understood. as such, human premature aging syndromes, which recapitulate many aspects of natural aging, may allow us to further investigate this phenomenon at the molecular and cellular level. these syndromes largely result from heritable genetic alterations that mainly affect dna repair proteins, or proteins associated with the nuclear periphery  <cit> . for instance, one category of premature aging syndromes, known as human progeroid syndromes , are caused by mutations in nuclear lamins or other proteins of the nuclear envelope. as a result, cells from these patients are characterized by nuclear envelope dysfunction, altered nuclear activity, impaired structural dynamics and aberrant cell signaling  <cit> . these irregularities may manifest in premature aging, as well as conditions such as neuropathy.

recently, two unrelated patients who exhibited several hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome-like phenotypes were described  <cit> . these patients, however, did not present with many of the symptoms common to those with known human progeroid syndromes. for instance, neither patient showed signs of ischemia or atherosclerosis, both fundamental phenotypes of hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome. cognitive function was also identified as normal in both patients. moreover, the age of the patients studied was not consistent with the current understanding of known human progeroid syndromes, with these patients being much older than the average life span of progeroid patients. this condition was named néstor–guillermo progeria syndrome . whole-genome and exome sequencing of both affected patients identified them as homozygous for a mutation in the barrier-to-autointegration factor  <dig>  gene  <cit> . this mutation  results in the expression of a banf <dig> protein where alanine  <dig> is mutated to a threonine residue.

banf <dig> encodes a protein consisting of  <dig> amino acid residues with a molecular weight of approximately 10 kda  <cit> . nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic studies have determined that banf <dig> may form a homodimer, which is the active state required to bind chromatin  <cit> . during g <dig>  s and g <dig> phases of the cell cycle, banf <dig> is known to predominantly associate with the nuclear envelope, where it interacts with the lamina associated polypeptides emerin-man <dig>  domain of the nuclear scaffold proteins man <dig>  <cit> , emerin  <cit>  and lap <dig>  <cit> . here, banf <dig> regulates organization of the chromatin structure at the nuclear envelope by condensing dna via a looping mechanism  <cit> , as well as by binding histone h <dig> and histone linker h <dig>   <cit> . the interaction between banf <dig>  chromatin and protein from the lamina is tightly regulated, allowing proper nuclear assembly and chromatin organization during cell cycle progression  <cit> . in addition to these roles, banf <dig> has been proposed to regulate the transcription of specific genes  <cit> , to suppress the integration of retroviruses within the genome  <cit> , and to regulate specific developmental signals  <cit> .

despite the available data on banf <dig> biology, the contribution of the a12t mutation to the development of nestor-guillermo progeria syndrome is poorly understood. in their original study of the disease, puente et al. observed reduced levels of mutant banf <dig> in patient fibroblasts, and thus proposed that the mutation may affect protein stability  <cit> . it was therefore assumed that the observed phenotype of these patients was due to physiologically low levels of banf <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, we aimed to further decipher the role of the banf <dig> a12t mutation in the molecular processes leading to the development of the disease. to do so, we used a series of biochemical and molecular tools to understand the defect resulting from this genetic mutation.

RESULTS
in order to characterize the effect of the a12t mutation on the banf <dig> protein and ngps phenotype, we initially purified recombinant his-tagged banf <dig> wild type  and a12t proteins from e. coli using a protocol adapted from harris et al.  <cit> , although unlike harris et al, we retained the n-terminal his-tag. as previously described, recombinant wt banf <dig> was found in inclusion bodies , indicating aggregation of the protein in a higher-ordered complex, and thus necessitating denaturation and subsequent refolding of the protein during purification. using this method, both wild type and a12t banf <dig> displayed similar purification characteristics . banf <dig> forms a stable dimer in solution with a dimerization interface formed by helix α <dig>  the c-terminus of α <dig> and part of the loop linking α <dig> to the helical turn  <cit> . although alanine  <dig> is not located at the dimerization interface of banf <dig>  we experimentally tested whether a12t mutation may influence this interface indirectly. to do this, we detected both mutant and wild type protein as they eluted from a size exclusion column . here, both wild type and a12t recombinant banf <dig> eluted with a profile consistent with a mixture of monomeric and dimeric banf <dig>  supporting that this mutation does not disrupt the dimerization of the protein in vitro.figure  <dig>

Δε is in cm- <dig> m- <dig> 



as alanine  <dig> of banf <dig> is positioned in a loop immediately following helix α <dig>  we hypothesized that mutation of this residue to a bulky β-branched threonine could influence the structure of the banf <dig> protein. to assess this, we analyzed recombinant wt and a12t banf <dig> by circular dichroism , a standard biophysical technique used to study the secondary structure content of proteins in solution. cd spectra of both wild type and a12t banf <dig> showed typical α-helical profiles, with minima in the near far- uv at a wavelength of 220 nm . by this method we detected a spectrum for wild type banf <dig> that was consistent with published data  <cit> . furthermore, overlay of the a12t banf <dig> spectrum indicated the secondary structure of the protein was not affected as a result of mutation.

to explore whether a12t mutation may alter the banf <dig> structure on a smaller scale, we obtained the crystal structure of wild type banf <dig> bound to dna from the protein data bank , and used phyre <dig>  <cit>   to predict the three-dimensional structure of banf <dig> following a12t mutation. modeling was subsequently confirmed using i-tasser  <cit>  . consistent with the cd spectra data, phyre <dig> model prediction of the a12t mutant did not suggest major modifications to the structure of banf <dig>  although interestingly did indicate a potential alteration in the position of amino acids essential for dna binding . based on the crystal structure, the n terminus of banf <dig> helix α <dig> is important for contacting dna and establishing hydrogen bonds between gln <dig>  lys <dig> and the nucleotide phosphates  <cit> . in our model, we therefore predict that the banf <dig> a12t mutation may displace the side chain of lys <dig> from its original position , preventing the formation of hydrogen bonds between this residue and the phosphodiester backbone and thus indicating a possible dna binding defect. interestingly, lys <dig> is also known to be buried in a pocket formed by the carbonyl groups of gly <dig>  ile <dig> and leu <dig>  <cit> . in our prediction, the lys <dig> ε-amino group sits outside this pocket, which is likely to have structural and functional consequences . in addition, our model also predicts the side chains of glu <dig> are displaced, potentially affecting the formation of the salt bridge between this residue and lys <dig>  <cit>  . both lys <dig> and glu <dig> are important for the stabilization of helix α <dig> and the loop connecting α <dig> and α <dig>  which brings positively charged lys <dig> and arg <dig> to the dna binding site.figure  <dig>

to understand further the instability previously described for a12t banf <dig>  we expressed 3x flag-tagged wt or a12t banf <dig> in hela cells from a cmv promoter. consistent with the observations of puente et al.  <cit> , we observed minimal levels of the a12t mutant protein when compared to the wild type protein, as determined by immunoblotting using the same banf <dig> antibody as in their study . to confirm that we had indeed detected ectopically expressed flag tagged banf <dig>  we stripped the nitrocellulose membrane of the banf <dig> antibody and re-probed with an antibody against the flag tag . unexpectedly, this indicated equal expression of both the wild type and mutant banf <dig> figure  <dig> 
alteration of banf <dig> a12t antigenicity and stability. : the anti-banf <dig> antibody  does not recognize exogenous a12t banf <dig> in cell lysates. cell extracts of u2os cells overexpressing wt or a12t 3x flag-tagged banf <dig> or an empty vector  were resolved on a nu-page gel and immunoblotted using an anti-banf <dig> antibody. membranes were stripped and immunoblotted using an anti-flag antibody. a β-actin antibody was used as an internal protein loading control. : recombinant a12t banf <dig> has a lower antigenicity than wt banf <dig>  500 ng of recombinant hexahis tagged wt and a12t banf <dig> were run on a nu-page gel and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the membrane was stained using ponceau red as a loading control, then blotted with an anti-banf <dig> antibody . after visualization, the membrane was stripped and immunoblotted using an anti hexahis antibody. : recombinant a12t banf <dig> has a lower antigenicity than wt banf <dig>  banf <dig> was visualized by blotting with an anti-banf <dig> antibody . : wild type and a12t mutant 3x flag banf <dig> protein stability. cells were incubated with cycloheximide  for the indicated time periods and cell lysates harvested for western blot analysis. protein levels were assessed using anti-flag antibodies to detect flag- tagged banf <dig> and anti-actin antibodies for protein loading. mdm <dig> degradation is shown as a positive control for the cycloheximide treatment. : quantification of . band signal intensity was quantified using imagej and standardized against the protein level a t =  <dig>  error bars represent the standard deviation  from at least three independent experiments.



these data raise the possibility that alanine  <dig> is required for antibody recognition of banf <dig>  such that reduced antigenicity may result from a12t mutation. to test this further, 500 ng of recombinant banf <dig> wt and a12t was run on a sds page gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting . the loading of equal quantities of proteins was verified by staining of the membrane using ponceau red. the immunoblot was then probed using an anti-banf <dig> antibody . similar to our findings using overexpressed wt and a12t banf <dig> in cells, the banf <dig> antibody failed to recognize the a12t recombinant protein to a level comparable to that observed for the wild type protein. to confirm this result, the membrane was stripped of antibody and then re-probed using an anti-hexahis antibody  to detect the n-terminal his tag of the recombinant banf <dig> proteins. consistent with the ponceau staining, the anti-hexahis antibody demonstrated that both proteins were present in similar amounts . in an attempt to confirm these findings, further immunoblots using a banf <dig> antibody supplied by sigma  were performed, and again the banf <dig> antibody demonstrated a lack of recognition of the mutant protein . this experiment was repeated several times with proteins from different purification batches and consistently suggested a reduced antigenicity of the mutant protein when anti-banf <dig> antibody was used. interestingly, a similar alteration of antigenicity of banf <dig> as a result of epitope mutation has previously been reported  <cit> . in this study by lin and engelman, an anti-banf <dig> antibody raised against a peptide encompassing amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> did not recognize k6a and k18a banf <dig> mutant proteins. these findings may be explained by the consideration that banf <dig> is a small and structured protein and that the antigenic regions recognized by the antibody are likely to be composed of only a few amino acids. the mutation of one of these residues, or a residue impacting the structure of this epitope, may therefore interfere with antibody binding.

the observation that a12t banf <dig> may be of reduced antigenicity compared to the wild type protein is of importance, as using the same banf <dig> antibody, puente et al. detected a lower signal for banf <dig> in cells from ngps patients  <cit> . the authors then discussed the possibility that the pathology observed is due to a decrease in the stability of banf <dig> a12t. in light of their results however, the hypothesis of a reduced half-life for a12t banf <dig> may be inadequate. to investigate whether a12t banf <dig> is indeed unstable, we investigated whether the half-life of this protein is reduced in cells compared to the wild type. to do this, we transfected hela cells with plasmids expressing 3x flag-tagged wt or a12t banf <dig> and then treated these cells with cycloheximide to block transcription and subsequent protein synthesis. cells were then harvested  <dig> and 26 hours post treatment, lysates were separated by sds-page and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose. ectopically expressed banf <dig> was then detected by western blot analysis using the anti-flag antibody. as shown in figure 3d-e, similar decay patterns were detected for both wt and a12t banf <dig> over the experimental time course . these data demonstrate similar stability of wt and a12t banf <dig>  to confirm efficacy of our treatment, we also immunoblotted for mdm <dig>  a protein with a known short-life; as expected, loss of protein was observed by our first time point  <cit> . we were unable to extend our cycloheximide treatment past 26 hours due to cell death. taken together, our results provide strong evidence that the banf <dig> a12t mutant is stable and that the phenotype seen in the ngps patients is likely to be due to an altered function of banf <dig> 

as mentioned previously, our structural modeling indicated the presence of a bulky threonine residue, in place of alanine residue  <dig>  might disrupt the dna binding pocket of banf <dig>  to investigate this further, we performed dna mobility shift assays. escalating concentrations of recombinant purified wt and a12t banf <dig> were incubated with a  <dig> nucleotide double-stranded dna oligonucleotide. the dna probe was labeled with a 5’ fam and the interaction between banf <dig> and the dna observed as retardation in the migration of the complex through a polyacrylamide gel. as previously described, banf <dig> wt has a high affinity for double-stranded dna and bundles dna in a highly ordered nucleoprotein complex  <cit> . the kinetics of binding were first studied after incubation for 5 minutes at 37°c, however due to the rate of binding, we were unable to observe intermediate complexes. the reaction was then performed at 4°c for 30 minutes and this allowed us to observe the lower order complexes. interestingly, the banf <dig> a12t mutant exhibited a marked defect in dna binding compared to the wild type protein . to confirm our observation we conducted dna mobility shift assay in the same conditions using a  <dig>  kb double stranded dna plasmid. consistent with our previous observations, a12t banf <dig> exhibited a decreased affinity for longer dna substrates .figure  <dig>

several other mutations have been reported to affect the dna binding properties of banf <dig>  <cit> . they can be classified based on the severity of the binding defect, as well as their ability to dimerize and to bind lamina-associated proteins  <cit> . however, to date, none of these mutants have solely impacted dna binding versus defects in protein binding. to determine if the a12t mutation also affects the association with known nuclear envelope proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. for this, 3x flag tagged wild type or a12t banf <dig> was expressed and immunoprecipitated in hela cells. immunoblotting was then performed using antibodies against emerin, lamin and histone h <dig>  proteins that have previously been shown to interact with banf <dig> at the nuclear envelope  <cit> . interestingly, banf <dig> a12t did not display any defects in binding to these proteins . interestingly, banf <dig> a12t was still present in the chromatin fraction of a subcellular fractionation, consistent with its interaction with histone protein h <dig> . consistent with these observations, immunofluorescence demonstrated that the a12t mutant banf <dig> localized normally to the nuclear envelope in u2os cells. interestingly, although expression levels of mutant and wild type were equivalent , the majority of cells expressing the a12t mutant demonstrated nuclear envelope aberrations consistent with that observed in ngps patients . together, our data indicates that the a12t mutation of banf <dig>  found in nestor-guillermo progeria syndrome, causes a disruption of the dna binding surface, inhibiting its normal interaction with double stranded dna. the banf <dig> a12t mutant however localizes normally to the nuclear envelope, where it interacts with nuclear envelope proteins and chromatin.figure  <dig>

discussion
the identification of two progeria individuals with a single point mutation in banf <dig> is important for our understanding of these syndromes. interestingly, puente et al. reported that although mrna levels of a12t mutant banf <dig> were found at similar levels to wild type patients, banf <dig> a12t protein was detected at a much lower level. this was originally interpreted as a result of protein instability. in our study, we sought to understand the mechanism through which this may occur. interestingly, our study suggested that the a12t mutant was not unstable, and that the lower levels of the protein observed were merely an artifact of antigenicity alterations towards the banf <dig> antibody, as a result of the a12t mutation. we therefore reasoned that this mutation might affect protein function in other ways that could explain the ngps phenotype. our structural modeling of banf <dig>  predicted that the mutation of alanine  <dig> to a bulky threonine, could disrupt the banf <dig> dna-binding pocket and thus disrupt the interaction of banf <dig> with dna. we confirmed by emsa that the a12t banf <dig> was indeed perturbed in its ability to bind to dna, suggesting that the modeling was correct. further, our modeling and cd spectra analysis suggested that this was the only disruption to the banf <dig> structure. moreover, we found that the a12t mutant, like wt banf <dig>  localized to the nuclear envelope and interacted with lamin and histone h <dig>  further studies using nuclear magnetic resonance  or crystallographic methods would be needed to gain a more detailed visualization of a12t structural modulations.

although we cannot exclude that the ngps phenotypes result from an undiscovered role of banf <dig>  we suggest that the dna binding deficiency observed in the banf <dig> a12t mutant contributes to the cellular phenotypes observed in ngps. banf <dig> has many proposed roles within the cell that requires it to bind to dna. banf <dig> has been shown to simultaneously bind to the nuclear membrane, lem domain containing protein, lap <dig> and dna in vitro, implicating banf <dig> as having a crucial role in tethering the chromatin to the nuclear envelope . supporting this, both lap <dig> and another lem-domain, banf1-interacting protein, emerin, interact with other major structural components of the nuclear envelope called lamins. lamins play a key role in nuclear structure and assembly and mutations in lamin genes also lead to a human progeria syndrome, hutchinson–gilford progeria syndrome . in hgps the disruption to the lamina organization, induced by the mutant lamin proteins leads to areas of weakness around the nuclear envelope, this can cause the chromatin to herniate, pushing out the destabilized membrane. interestingly, while we were unable to assess ngps patient cells endogenously expressing mutant banf <dig>  ectopic expression of the a12t banf <dig> did result in herniation of the nuclear envelope, consistent with what has been reported for the patients  figure 5). it has been proposed that banf <dig>  through direct binding to lem proteins and indirect binding to lamins, may link chromatin to the inner nuclear envelope and this appears to be the case in c. elegans . in support of this, herein we have shown that mutation of a12t in banf <dig> disrupts the dna binding of banf <dig>  leading to the disruption of the nuclear envelope.

CONCLUSIONS
our study now clarifies the role of the banf <dig> a12t mutation in ngps, providing insight into the disease process. our study has important implications for the treatment of ngps patients and has provided new mechanistic insights into the function of banf <dig> and the nuclear envelope in aging.
