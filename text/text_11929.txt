BACKGROUND
molecular genetic information of the major agricultural species, like cattle, is crucial in harnessing the benefit of genetic variation for economically important traits. the process of exploiting this information is greatly facilitated by the ordering of molecular markers along the chromosomes. high resolution rh mapping is a valuable approach to build maps, where both polymorphic as well as non-polymorphic markers can be included  <cit> . of the several whole genome radiation hybrid panels available for cattle  <cit> , the  <dig>  rad whole genome rh  panel has been shown to have the highest mapping resolution  <cit> . radiation hybrid maps also serve as one of the tools to facilitate the assembly of genome sequences  <cit> . direct comparison of an rh map with a genome assembly allows identification of inconsistencies between the optimal marker order, found using the rh data, and the marker order observed in the current genome assembly.

the bovine genome sequencing project, started in  <dig>  has released three different assemblies of the genome. the first preliminary assembly , produced with 3x coverage, was released in september 2004; the second assembly  with  <dig> x coverage in june 2005; and the third draft assembly  with  <dig> x coverage in august  <dig>  <cit> . the third draft assembly was produced using a combination of whole genome shotgun reads and bac end sequences  <cit> . previous comparisons of radiation hybrid mapping data with bovine genome sequence assembly  have shown large discrepancies on many chromosomes including bta <dig>  and bta <dig>   <cit> . these discrepancies and the fact that there have been many qtl identified on these chromosomes  <cit> , has prompted us to choose bta <dig> and  <dig> as candidate chromosomes for high resolution mapping.

the traditional approach of rh mapping is to heuristically produce a so-called framework map, incorporating only a fraction of typed markers which are reliably ordered. however, a major disadvantage of building framework maps is that it positions the remaining unplaced markers into bins of confidence, which may not be of true order. instead, we have constructed high resolution maps of bta <dig> and  <dig> using the comparative rh mapping approach recently introduced in carthagène  <cit> . this approach is based on a probabilistic bayesian model integrating the usual rh probabilistic model with a probabilistic model of breakpoint occurrences with a reference order, typically obtained from the position of orthologous markers in a related sequenced genome  <cit> . in this probabilistic model, breakpoints induced by chromosomal rearrangements are considered as rare events, following a poisson law. equivalently, we consider that genome assembly errors create rare spurious breakpoints between the rh map order and the current assembly order. therefore, carthagène was used to produce a new rh map integrating the rh data with the current bovine genome assembly.

the objective of this study was to generate high resolution rh maps of bta <dig> and  <dig>  and to compare them with the current cattle genome sequence build. we also constructed cattle-human comparative maps of bta <dig> and  <dig>  which are known to be orthologous to human chromosome  <dig>  and hsa <dig> respectively  <cit> . this comparative mapping information as well as the high resolution rh map provides an important independent source of information to improve the bovine genome sequence assembly.

RESULTS
genotyping of  <dig>  rad panel and rh map construction
the bovine  <dig>  rad panel was constructed to complement an existing  <dig> rad panel and increase the mapping resolution  <cit> . we used snp markers for rh mapping because of their availability from the bovine genome sequencing project, their abundance throughout the genome  <cit>  and the ease and low cost of large scale snp genotyping  <cit> . correct snp marker order is also essential for a variety of gene discovery approaches such as interval mapping or linkage disequilibrium based methods. the snp markers were chosen from the bovine build  <dig>  and typed on the  <dig> k wg-rh panel using the illumina beadstation genotyping system  <cit> . this genotyping system produces reproducible and robust data due to its  <dig> fold redundancy at each locus. there is an average of  <dig> representatives of each bead type present on every array which allows for  <dig> independent genotypes of each snp locus. three positive  and three negative  controls were used in the experiment. all markers observed with even a small amount of amplification in any of the three negative controls were discarded. also, any markers which did not exhibit clear cluster separation between positive and negative controls were discarded. the remaining markers were scored as described previously  <cit> . a total of  <dig> %  loci on bta <dig> and  <dig> %  loci on bta <dig> were successfully amplified and scored. markers were selected from the bovine build  <dig>  which had a significant number of snps misassigned to the wrong chromosomes. hence, out of  <dig> and  <dig> successfully amplified loci on bta <dig> and  <dig>  we mapped  <dig> and  <dig> markers on bta <dig> and bta <dig>  respectively. the details of the snp markers mapped on bta <dig> and  <dig> are provided in additional file  <dig>  rh maps were constructed using the comparative mapping approach of carthagène software  <cit>  which allows us to simultaneously exploit the rh data and the knowledge of a known related order. rh likelihood is sensitive to large scale ordering discrepancies, as produced by the assembly errors, but has difficulties to order closely related markers reliably. the assembly itself, despite possible assembly errors, is very informative at low scale . because it exploits more data than pure rh mapping, it cannot be related to framework mapping. however, as shown earlier  <cit> , integrating these two types of information produces high resolution maps of better quality. in this case, it also pinpoints likely assembly errors.

on bta <dig>  we observed  <dig> different retention patterns,  <dig> unique retention patterns and  <dig> shared compatible retention patterns, out of  <dig> loci tested. the loci sharing compatible retention patterns suggest that they were so close that radiation could not induce any chromosomal break between them. the average retention frequency for all the mapped markers on bta <dig> was  <dig> % and varied from  <dig> % for bta- <dig> to  <dig>  % for bta- <dig> . the markers in the close vicinity of thymidine kinase gene on bta <dig> reflected higher retention frequencies as this marker was used to select for hybrid cell lines  <cit> . similarly on bta <dig> we observed  <dig> different retention patterns,  <dig> unique retention patterns and  <dig> shared compatible retention patterns, out of  <dig> loci tested. the average retention frequency for all the mapped markers on bta <dig> was  <dig> % and varied from  <dig>  % for bta- <dig> to  <dig> % for bta- <dig>  with higher retention frequencies towards the telomeric end of the chromosome. previous studies have reported that the pattern of retention frequencies varies markedly between chromosomes  <cit> . the total length of the rh maps of bta <dig> and bta <dig> extended to  <dig>  cr and  <dig>  cr, respectively . additional information about the maps, including the average resolution, and the range and standard deviation of the marker distances, is provided in table  <dig> 

comparison with the bovine build  <dig>  sequences
we aligned our chromosomal maps with the bovine build  <dig>  sequences for bta <dig> and bta <dig> and found an overall agreement of order of loci between the two maps, although a number of inconsistencies were observed. out of the  <dig> markers mapped to the 12k map of bta <dig>   <dig> markers were assigned to bta <dig> by the bovine genome sequence assembly. for  <dig> loci, we could detect scaffolds, which were not assigned to any chromosome by the sequence assembly . fourteen loci did not show acceptable hits with the bovine genome sequence assembly. one hundred and four markers were found to be incongruous and twelve scaffolds were found to be misplaced. five scaffolds were found to be transposed and six were found to be inverted. in total, seventy four markers within scaffolds were found to be misplaced. one marker, bta- <dig>  was assigned bovine chromosome  <dig> by the sequence assembly . in addition, we observed a total of  <dig> gaps  on the bta <dig> map .

for bta <dig>  out of the  <dig> markers mapped,  <dig> markers were assigned to bta <dig> by the bovine genome sequence assembly. similarly, we could detect scaffolds for  <dig> loci, which were not assigned any chromosome by the sequence assembly . twelve loci did not show any acceptable hits with the sequence assembly. forty five markers were found to be incongruous and ten scaffolds were found to be misplaced. four scaffolds were found to be transposed and three scaffolds were found to be inverted. one marker, bta- <dig>  was assigned bovine chromosome  <dig> by the sequence assembly . in total, twenty five markers within scaffolds were found to be misplaced. furthermore, we observed  <dig> gaps  on the bta <dig> rh map .

for comparison, we computed the loglikelihood and length of maps built according to the bovine genome sequence order. we re-evaluated maps under a pure diploid rh model using all markers that had a match on the bovine build  <dig>  sequences. there were  <dig> markers that were in common with bovine build  <dig>  sequences and rh map of bta <dig>  the map built according to the bovine build  <dig>  sequence order has a log-10-likelihood of - <dig>  and extends up to  <dig>  cr, whereas the map built according to our rh map order has a log-10-likelihood of - <dig>  and extends up to  <dig>  cr . for bta <dig>  there were  <dig> markers that were common between rh map and bovine build  <dig>  sequences. the map built according to the bovine build  <dig>  sequence order has a log-10-likelihood of - <dig>  and extends up to  <dig>  cr, whereas the map built according to our rh map order has a log-10-likelihood of - <dig>  and extends up to  <dig>  cr . thus based on the rh data, the map derived from the bovine genome sequence is much less likely than our rh map order with log10-likelihood ratio differences of - <dig> and - <dig> for bta <dig> and bta <dig> respectively.

generation of the cattle-human comparative map
excluding binned markers, four hundred and fourteen  and one hundred and seventy-five  markers having human orthologs  were used for the construction of cattle-human comparative maps. we identified  <dig> homologous synteny blocks  on bta <dig> and  <dig> hsbs on bta <dig> as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> respectively . also,  <dig> breakpoints were identified between bta <dig> and the corresponding segments in the hsa <dig>  while  <dig> breakpoints were identified between bta <dig> and hsa <dig>  we compared our maps with the previous studies  <cit> . the details of the number of markers used in all the three studies, number of hsbs, their size range and their median is provided in table  <dig>  the hsbs identified in our study are more in number as well as smaller in size because of the high density of markers mapped on the chromosomes. in addition, several of the  <dig> and  <dig> snp markers mapped on bta <dig> and  <dig> respectively, did not produce hits on the bovine  and human  chromosome sequences at the given expectation threshold, and some  produced hits on other human chromosomes, thus resulting in a larger number of smaller hsbs than previously described. the coordinates of our hsbs overall were in agreement with those identified in both earlier studies. however, small discrepancies in the orientation of a few hsbs were observed. nine of the previously identified hsbs on hsa <dig> and  <dig> on hsa <dig>  <cit>  were split into  <dig> and  <dig> hsbs respectively, in our study. in the schibler et al.  <cit>  study,  <dig> hsbs on hsa <dig> and  <dig> on hsa <dig> were split into  <dig> and  <dig> hsbs respectively. one of the hsbs on hsa <dig>  found in our study as well as in everts-van der wind et al.  <cit>  study, was not reported by schibler et al.  <cit> . the synteny block from  <dig> – <dig>  mb identified in both of the previous studies  <cit>  on hsa <dig> is absent from our comparative map. we have only  <dig> markers in that region and they both show hits in the human genome at the same position of  <dig>  mb. therefore, although we cannot define them as a synteny block, our data supports the presence of the synteny block on hsa <dig>  one region from 129– <dig> mb in hsa <dig> shows disagreement across all the three studies and needs further investigation. the reason for minor discrepancies with the previous studies may be attributed to the use of different radiation hybrid panel and the mapping approach used.

CONCLUSIONS
we have built a high resolution rh map of bovine chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> consisting of  <dig> and  <dig> snp markers, respectively. maps of both the chromosomes, when compared with the bovine genome sequence assembly, show that there is significant internal rearrangement of the markers involving displacement, inversion and flips within the scaffolds and some scaffolds were found to be misplaced by the third draft  of the bovine genome assembly. the rh maps reported here with an average resolution of  <dig> locus/ <dig> kb and  <dig> locus/ <dig> kb on bta <dig> and bta <dig> respectively, are useful for ordering snp markers which can be used in future gene discovery investigations. furthermore, they aid in the identification and rectification of potential errors in the current bovine genome sequence assembly.
