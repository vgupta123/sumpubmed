BACKGROUND
the rhesus macaque  serves as a model for many facets of human development and physiology and is one of the most widely used nonhuman primates for the study of infectious diseases, such as aids. the widespread use of this species in biomedical research led to a proposal in  <dig> to generate its complete genome sequence  <cit> . this proposal was followed up by low-pass whole-genome shotgun  sequencing of rhesus in  <dig> and the completion of a preliminary draft of the genome in january  <dig>  <cit> . the importance of rhesus and related macaque species as experimental animals has prompted us to use the genome sequence to develop a macaque-specific microarray to provide the requisite tools for global gene expression profiling and functional genomic analyses.

until recently, we and others have been limited to using human sequence based microarrays for experiments aimed at analyzing gene expression in rhesus and other macaque species  <cit> . although not optimal, this approach is feasible because of the relatively close evolutionary distance between the two species. rhesus and human species diverged approximately  <dig> million years ago, and the nucleotide similarity between rhesus and human is estimated at 95%  <cit> . despite this similarity, nucleotide mismatches between the species can confound expression analysis on commonly used microarray platforms. for example, experiments using mixed-species cdna microarrays required raising expression fold-change thresholds to a level that limited the number of genes whose expression can be confidently measured  <cit> . similarly, an affymetrix genechip analysis measuring presence of gene expression by hybridizing rhesus mrna on human chips required twice the signal intensity for affymetrix analysis software to indicate gene presence compared with using human mrna, rendering many human genechip probe sets unusable when analyzing rhesus samples  <cit> . in silico approaches have also been used to try to improve the reliability of using human probe sets to study cross-species gene expression by informatically "masking" probes that show excessive cross-species nucleotide probe mismatching  <cit> . even single base-pair mismatches occurring on agilent 60-mer oligonucleotide microarrays may result in as much as a 50% drop in test/reference signal intensity if the mismatches fall in the 5' region of the oligonucleotide probe  <cit> .

we previously reported on the use of macaque est sequences to develop the first commercially available two-color oligonucleotide rhesus-specific microarray, katze rhesus macaque  <dig>   <cit> . over  <dig>  est sequences from eleven rhesus tissues were used for probe design. krm <dig> gene coverage represented only  <dig>  distinct rhesus/human refseq  <cit>  orthologs out of a possible  <dig> , largely due to the redundancy that is characteristic of tissue-specific est libraries as well as difficulties in achieving effective mrna transcript coverage of unique est contigs for probe design. to supplement the est-derived gene list, an additional  <dig> refseq gene probes on the microarray were designed from sequence tag site  sequences generated by leveraging human transcript and genomic information  <cit> , and approximately  <dig>  human probes were added to the array from the agilent human ha1v <dig> microarray to include sequences important in virus-host interaction pathways. est sequence assemblies often did not extend to the 3' untranslated region  of an orthologous human gene, rendering probe design regions proximal to the 3' edge of genes unavailable. due to 3' labeling bias, agilent technologies recommends designing probes within  <dig> bp of the 3' end of a gene transcript . figure  <dig> shows the effect of probe distance from the terminal exon 3' utr for our krm <dig> est-based array. probe sequences more than  <dig> bp from the 3' end of the human gene ortholog showed a dramatic attenuation of signal intensity with the best hybridization signals occurring closest to the 3' end of the gene.

for the above reasons, there was clearly a need for an alternative to our est-based array to provide better coverage of rhesus/human gene orthologs and to optimize probe selection regions to include genomic regions proximal to the 3' end of gene transcripts. in the present study, we employed a human/rhesus comparative genomics approach to address these issues, using human genome sequence and annotation to derive optimal probe design regions from an unfinished and highly fragmented build of the rhesus genome sequence. this approach greatly increased the number of genes available for expression analysis and optimized hybridization signal intensities. these results show that early stage genome projects are a valuable source of information that can be immediately utilized for functional genomics assays.

RESULTS
earlier studies report that the terminal exon of human transcripts, which contains the optimal 3' utr microarray probe design region, averages almost  <dig>  bp with a median length of  <dig>  bp  <cit> . if probe hybridization efficiency is related to the distance of a probe from the 3' utr, it means that the great majority of all optimal microarray probe design regions fall within the terminal exon of human genes. we tested the conservation of rhesus/human 3' utrs by first deconstructing the human genome into its constituent exons. we extracted sequence data for each exon from the may  <dig> build of the human genome using refseq version  <dig> exon coordinates for  <dig>  genes provided by the ucsc genome browser annotation  <cit> . these  <dig>  exon sequences, and their predicted exon order and orientation for each gene, were used to construct a human refseq exon sequence database. we found a mean length of  <dig>  bp for the terminal exon and 3' utr of refseq genes including single-exon genes and excluding genes with unassigned chromosomal locations. terminal exon lengths ranged from  <dig> bp up to a maximum exon length of  <dig>  bp with a median length of  <dig> bp.

we matched human genome transcript information to rhesus unfinished contigs by initially comparing  <dig>  terminal exon sequences derived from refseq with  <dig>  baylor rhesus genome project version  <dig>  wgs contigs averaging  <dig>  bp in length, excluding rhesus assemblies containing highly repetitive elements. remarkably, we were able to match  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  human terminal exon sequences  to the unfinished rhesus genome sequence, including  <dig>  out of  <dig>   distinct rhesus/human refseq gene orthologs. mean alignment size was approximately  <dig>  bp covering greater than 90% of each human terminal exon. human terminal exon sequences matched rhesus contigs with a  <dig> % mean identity.

rhesus microarray design and probe quality assessment
microarray design requires comparing all individual probes with all transcriptome sequences to exclude probes highly similar to more than one location in the transcriptome and therefore subject to non-specific mrna cross-hybridization  <cit> . to address this, we created a "virtual" rhesus transcriptome by aligning  <dig>  non-terminal human refseq exons with the same  <dig>  rhesus wgs contigs used to determine the probe design regions described above. again, we were able to align non-terminal exons for over 99% of human refseq genes with a mean alignment size of  <dig> bp and a human/rhesus  <dig> % mean identity. best matching human/rhesus exon sequences were concatenated in order and orientation based on the human transcript information to create a virtual rhesus transcriptome to test probe regions for cross-hybridization potential. to guard against missing pieces of the early stage wgs genome, we created a more conservative composite rhesus/human transcriptome database, which we used to test for cross-hybridization. probes were designed and arrayed at agilent technologies resulting in  <dig>  rhesus/human refseq ortholog gene probes, including transcript variants, which represent over  <dig>  distinct genes. these  <dig>  rhesus genome-derived probes were included in the final array layout, with one probe per gene. the new  <dig> -probe custom rhesus array, katze rhesus macaque  <dig> , is commercially available from agilent technologies  <cit> , agilent microarray design identification  number  <dig>  affymetrix corporation has also recently developed a commercial rhesus-specific microarray based on the november,  <dig> version of the baylor rhesus genome project along with genbank rhesus est, sts and mrna sequences up to march  <dig>   <dig>  <cit> .

we tested the similarity of the krm <dig> genome-derived probes to other available rhesus sequences to gauge the quality of wgs contigs used in probe design. we searched each krm <dig> probe against a blast database of  <dig>  high-quality genbank sts sequences derived from rhesus pcr products designed specifically to 3' utr regions  <cit> . we found that  <dig>  krm <dig> 60-mer probes matched rhesus sts sequences with a mean similarity of  <dig> %, demonstrating high sequence quality in 3' utr probe design regions despite the overall low  <dig> Ã— genome coverage  in the january  <dig> build of the rhesus genome.

distance of probes from transcript 3' utrs
comparison of krm <dig> and krm <dig> rhesus arrays
we tested the krm <dig> microarray by hybridizing crna probes generated from equal mass amounts of mrna derived from rhesus brain and spleen . the same probes were also used to replicate the experiment on our est-based krm <dig> microarray. brain and spleen tissues were chosen for the experiment to maximize potential differential expression of krm <dig> probes, which were mainly designed using rhesus brain and spleen tissue est sequences. a minimum two-fold difference in test/reference channel signal intensity and a maximum p value of  <dig>  were selected as cut offs to indicate differential gene expression for individual probes.

using these criteria,  <dig>  genes showed differential expression on the krm <dig> microarray, compared with  <dig>  genes showing differential expression on the krm <dig> microarray. although the number of differentially expressed genes will obviously change according to experimental samples and treatments, this helps demonstrate the effect of the four-fold increase in the number of unique genes available on the krm <dig> array. in addition, 60-mer probes for  <dig>  human refseq gene orthologs are common to both the krm <dig> and krm <dig> arrays, which allowed us to compare cy3/cy <dig> signal channel and fold-change measurements for each of these probes.

when we compared  <dig>  genes present on both the krm <dig> and krm <dig> arrays,  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed on the krm <dig> array versus  <dig> differentially expressed genes on krm <dig>  a 22% improvement using the new array. of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed on krm <dig>  <dig> of the identical genes  showed differential expression on the krm <dig> array. the greater number of differentially expressed genes on krm <dig> versus krm <dig> for genes represented on both arrays suggests a distinct improvement in probe performance using genomic versus est based array probe design. despite this improvement, overlap in expression results between identical genes on krm <dig> and krm <dig> is, as expected, not perfect, and microarray results will continue to be used, by our lab and others, as part of a discovery process requiring individual gene verification by methods such as rt-pcr. hybridization results for all rhesus probes for both arrays in the above experiment are given in supplemental tables  <dig> and  <dig> .

the results of the brain versus spleen hybridizations highlight the extra coverage garnered in the krm <dig> array. figure  <dig> shows genes differentially expressed between the two tissue sets in the gaba receptor signaling and antigen presentation pathways, as determined using ingenuity pathway analysis software  <cit> . as expected, the cluster of gaba receptor signaling genes was more highly expressed in the brain tissue, whereas the cluster corresponding to antigen presentation was expressed at higher levels in spleen. we saw a 40% better representation of genes in the antigen presentation pathway using the krm <dig> array, and a 100% increase in representation of the genes in the gaba pathway. this is of particular interest since one of the macaque est libraries that we sequenced to design the krm <dig> array was brain derived. although our est sequences did contain data for  <dig> of the  <dig> gaba-related genes, sufficient sequence data for probe design was available for only three of these genes . it is therefore clear that use of the early stage genome information provides better sequence information for probe design as well as a greater depth of coverage in terms of overall numbers of genes.

CONCLUSIONS
one of the greatest benefits of utilizing early stage genome information in conjunction with closely related species annotation in oligonucleotide microarray design is the huge increase in the number of different genes available for mrna abundance measurements compared with relying on est sequence data alone. this increased number of genes in turn helps provide more comprehensive input for pathway and network analysis of differential gene expression. figure  <dig> shows the average coverage per pathway, where at least one gene is present, for  <dig> pathway maps represented in genego's metacore <cit>  database for genes available on krm <dig> and krm <dig> arrays.

the relationship between signal intensity and probe distance from the 3' utr was much more dramatic than expected and a factor to be seriously considered in microarray probe design as well as microarray analysis. the apparent reason for this bias appears to relate to the efficiency of the reverse transcriptase reaction.

historically, full-length cdna transcripts have been challenging to achieve, with most first-strand synthesis reactions resulting in pools of transcripts in the  <dig> bp to  <dig>  kbp range. premature terminations of the reaction frequently occur due to secondary and tertiary structures in the transcript, and increased product size is often associated with increases in single-base errors in the sequence  <cit> . due to the nature of the reverse transcriptase reaction, the 3' region of the transcript is therefore the best target for probe design considering its greater likelihood of being transcribed accurately and completely. this may be particularly significant when designing probes for transcript variants where alternative exons require probes distal to the end of the gene transcript. the distance of the probe from the 3' utr may also greatly outweigh other factors such as probe/mrna mismatching, so that mrna samples from closely related macaque species including m. nemestrina and m. fascicularis, can also be used for gene expression analysis on the rhesus genome-based krm <dig> microarray.  <dig>  krm <dig> rhesus probes compared with m. nemestrina and m. fascicularis est sequences showed a greater than 98% similarity to both species, representing on average a single base mismatch per 60-mer probe.

although there are many advantages in leveraging annotations from closely related species to design microarray probes from genomic sequences, there are obvious limitations to this method. gene isoforms, including splice variants, are restricted to those mapped from the related species annotation; true splice variant information still has to be obtained by other methods, such as cdna sequencing from different tissues from the microarray target species. species-specific genes are also not addressed using this method. important innate immunity genes, such as theta-defensins, are only expressed in old world monkeys such as rhesus macaque  <cit> , whereas the adaptive immune system hla-c loci present in humans is missing in macaques  <cit> .

in addition to designing rhesus probes using human genome annotations, we will also continue to use species-specific cdna-derived probes on future macaque microarrays, particularly in light of the growth of the number of macaque ests and full-length mrna transcripts available in public databases. currently, almost  <dig>  est-derived probes were carried over from krm <dig> onto the new krm <dig> microarray. ultimately, microarray probes derived from macaque-specific unannotated assemblies may be the most interesting of all, since they offer the greatest potential for discovering new genes and gene expression pathways  <cit> .
