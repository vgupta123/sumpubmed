BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenous ~21-nt noncoding rnas derived from single-stranded rna precursors that can form stem-loop structures  <cit> . mirna was first identified in caenorhabditis elegans and subsequently found in almost all eukaryotes  <cit> . in higher plants, mirnas play important roles in different developmental stages by mediating gene silencing at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels  <cit> . soybean is the most widely planted oil crop in the world; however, the regulation of its seed development is not well studied. the roles of mirnas in soybean seed development remain largely unknown. therefore, identification of new mirnas and elucidation of their functions in seed development will help us understand the regulation of soybean lipid synthesis. recently, the soybean genome sequence has been finished  <cit> , which will greatly advance biological research on soybeans.

although many soybean mirnas were identified in previous research  <cit> , the number of mirnas known in soybean is still very small and considerably lower than that in arabidopsis or rice. most identified soybean mirnas are of high abundance and conserved in many species; however, low-abundance and species-specific mirnas may play important roles in soybean-specific processes. generally, it is not easy to get information on these mirnas by conventional methods. recently, next-generation sequencing technology has been developed and widely applied to genomic studies such as gene expression pattern analysis, genome sequencing and small rna sequencing. because of its ultra high-throughput, many new mirnas with low abundance could be identified using this technology.

to date, the majority of mirna targets in soybean were predicted by bioinformatics approaches, and only a small portion were experimentally validated. a high-throughput degradome library sequencing technology has been developed for global identification of targets of mirnas in arabidopsis, rice and grapevine  <cit> . to detect new mirnas participating in soybean seed development and to identify targets of soybean mirnas globally, a small rna library and a degradome library using rnas from developing soybean seeds were constructed and sequenced by a solexa analyzer. each library generated more than  <dig> million short reads, and  <dig> new mirnas were identified, of which  <dig> mirnas belong to new families and  <dig> mirnas belong to conserved families. a total of  <dig> genes sliced by small rnas were detected via degradome library sequencing. among these,  <dig> genes were reproduction-related genes, and the corresponding mirnas may have a function in soybean seed development.

RESULTS
overview of small rna library sequencing
the soybean small rna library was constructed using rnas obtained from seeds of 15-day-old after flowering and sequenced by solexa sbs technology. we obtained more than  <dig> million raw reads, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length. as seen in figure  <dig>  the highest abundance was found for sequences with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides . after removal of low quality reads and adapter contaminants,  <dig> , <dig> unique reads were collected and  <dig> , <dig>  sequences were perfectly mapped to the soybean genome using soap <dig> software   <cit> . small rnas were analyzed by blast against the known noncoding rnas  deposited in the rfam and ncbi genbank databases  <cit> .  <dig>  distinct small rnas belonging to these categories were removed to avoid degradation contamination. the remaining reads were used to identify the conserved and new mirnas.

prediction and validation of new mirnas
in total,  <dig> soybean mirnas were annotated in the latest mirbase database  <cit> , and most of these were identified by small rna library sequencing. in this study,  <dig> annotated mirnas were detected in a seed small rna library. the remaining  <dig> mirnas, mostly soybean specific, were not detected, possibly because of low expression levels or spatial expression pattern. twenty-six new soybean mirnas not previously reported were identified by bioinformatic analysis. these new mirnas were named temporarily in the form of soy_number, e.g., soy_ <dig> . among the  <dig> new mirnas,  <dig> mirnas belonged to new families that had never been found in eukaryotes . all precursors of new mirnas had regular stem-loop structures, and four of these, soy_ <dig>  soy_ <dig>  soy_ <dig> and soy_ <dig>  were presented in figure  <dig>  these rna structures were predicted by mfold software and checked manually  <cit> .

forty-six mirna-star sequences , the complementary strands of functional mature mirna, were also detected in this study . these sequences are rarely found via conventional sequencing because of their quick degradation in cells. the detection of mirna* represented further evidence for the existence of mature mirnas. the mirna* sequences for  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> new mirnas were discovered . soy_ <dig> is the star strand of soy_ <dig>  which belongs to the family of mir <dig>  <cit> . gso-mir <dig> has been validated in wild soybean by northern blot in previous research  <cit> . in our study, soy_ <dig> was detected  <dig> times more than soy_ <dig> by solexa sequencing . therefore, soy_ <dig> may be also a functional mirna in soybean, not a mirna* of soy_ <dig>  in figure  <dig>  mirna mature sequences and mirna* sequences in mirna precursors are highlighted using different colors. their locations relative to rna loops in precursors were not invariable. large-scale sequencing allowed us to identify many mature mirna variants, which represent some differences in the 5' and/or 3' ends of mature mirna sequences .

to validate the predicted new mirnas, stem-loop rt-pcr was performed to examine their expression in soybean seeds  <cit> . primers used in stem-loop rt-pcr are listed in table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  all of the  <dig> predicted mirnas were found to be expressed in soybean seeds . the gma-mir <dig> was amplified as a positive control .

soybean seed degradome library construction and sequencing
to identify the target genes of mirnas in the soybean transcriptome, the widely adopted technology of degradome library sequencing was applied in this study  <cit> . mirnas mediate gene silencing by two mechanisms: mrna cleavage and translation repression. in higher plants, mirnas slice mrnas to regulate gene expression in most cases  <cit> . mirna-directed cleavage leaves a free 5' phosphate at the 3' fraction of the sliced genes. through poly rna purification, we constructed a 5' uncapped mrna library. the transcriptome-wide degradome information can be collected through high-throughput sequencing. we constructed a soybean seed degradome library and obtained more than  <dig> million raw reads with 99% of sequences having  <dig> or  <dig> nt by solexa sequencing. after quality filtration and adapter removal, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> unique reads, of which  <dig> , <dig>  were perfectly matched to the soybean genome . however, only  <dig>   reads could be mapped to a single position in the soybean genome. interestingly,  <dig>   reads had two hits in the genome. we further used the published williams  <dig> cdna database as the template to map clean reads. in total,  <dig> , <dig> unique reads were mapped to the soybean cdnas, indicating the high quality of the present degradome library . the reads that mapped to soybean cdnas were subjected to further analysis.

identification and classification of targets for annotated mirnas
compared to other mrna degradation mechanisms, mirna mediated mrna cleavage possesses special features. the sliced region of the mrna should be complementary to the mirna sequence, and the cleavage site is usually between the 10th and 11th nucleotides from the 5' end of the mirna. these features were used to identify targets of mirnas. we first extracted  <dig> nt upstream and downstream of 5' soybean cdnas sequences mapped by degradome reads to generate  <dig> nt target signatures as "t-signature"  <cit> . these signatures were collected to find mirna targets using cleaveland pipeline  <cit> . according to the abundance of mirna-complemented signatures relative to other signatures mapped to mrnas, the identified targets could be sorted into  <dig> classes. the targets with only mirna-directed cleavages were classified as class i. in class ii, the cleavage signature abundance was mostly enriched among all signatures. the abundance of cleavage signatures was higher than the median in class iii targets. the rest, with a low abundance of cleavage signatures, were grouped as class iv. because the abundance of mirna-directed cleavage targets in class i and class ii was much higher than other signatures, the targets in these two classes could have low false discovery rates and be more accurate. all identified mirna targets were classified according to these criteria.

to date,  <dig> soybean annotated mirnas have been deposited in the mirbase database. few mirna targets have been validated by experimental methods  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> targets of  <dig> evolutionarily conserved mirna families were identified . only  <dig> soybean-specific mirna families were found to silence  <dig> genes . it should be noted that many targets of a single conserved mirna are in pairs with very similar sequences, and the gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig> and gma-mir <dig> had at least  <dig> targets, with the gma-mir <dig> having more than  <dig> targets . on the other hand, the soybean-specific mirnas appear to have only a limited number of targets.

cds: coding sequence; utr: untranslated region; tp10m: transcripts per  <dig> million; cleavage site: nucleotide number from 5' end of cdna; adjacent target genes with same # or * were matched by identical reads; alegume or soybean specific mirnas; bmirna targets validated by rlm-5' race.

among the  <dig> identified targets of known mirnas,  <dig> targets  belong to class i and class ii, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> were classified into classes iii and iv, respectively . class i targets contained reads only from mirna-directed cleavage, representing perfect data with no other contamination. a series of targets for known mirnas, including gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig>  gma-mir <dig> and gma-mir <dig>  belong to this class . more targets of soybean-specific mirnas belong to class iii and class iv when compared to those targets of conserved mirnas.

cds: coding sequence; utr: untranslated region; tp10m: transcripts per  <dig> million; cleavage site: nucleotide number from 5' end of cdna; adjacent target genes with same # or * were matched by identical reads.

validation of multiple genes matched by identical reads as targets of corresponding mirnas
because many soybean genes have multiple copies, some targets were matched by the same reads, as shown in table  <dig>  rlm-5' race experiments were applied to examine whether the targets mapped by the same reads were sliced by the same mirna. for gma-mir <dig>   <dig> targets were matched by identical reads . among these,  <dig> hd-zip transcription factor genes were checked by 5' race . three genes, glyma <dig>  glyma6g <dig> and glyma08g <dig>  were found to be cleaved by gma-mirna <dig> after sequencing  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clones, respectively . one gene  could not be confirmed to be cleaved by gma-mir <dig>  therefore, most of the genes with the identical signature could be regulated by the corresponding mirna. by degradome sequencing, two cleavage sites were detected in  <dig> genes: glyma <dig>  glyma6g <dig> and glyma07g <dig>  however, only one cleavage site could be further validated by 5' race in glyma <dig> and glyma6g <dig> . the second cleavage site in these genes was not confirmed by 5' race, probably because of low frequencies.

most mirnas, especially conserved ones, could target several genes. the gma-mir <dig> had  <dig> target genes, and most of these could be grouped into class i and class ii . every target cdna had three regions: 5' utr, cds and 3' utr. in animals, mirna primarily binds to the 3' utr of a gene to suppress translation. however, in plants, mirna mainly silences gene expression through mrna cleavage. in soybean, the cleavage site of the mirna was usually located in the cds of target genes . because genes with full-length cdna represent only 5% of all predicted genes in the soybean database  <cit> , the genes sliced by mirna in the utr region may not be detected because of incomplete information on gene sequences. however, mirnas mainly cleave cds of rice genes with relatively integrated gene sequences  <cit> .

putative functions of annotated mirna targets
previous studies have found that mirnas function in plants mainly by cleaving mrna of transcription factors  <cit> . in this study, 82% of mirna targets were transcription factors, a large number of which were auxin response factors, growth regulating factors and nac transcription factors . these factors may be involved in plant growth and/or responses to environmental changes. most of the transcription factor gene targets belonged to class i and class ii, indicating that mirna was the key regulator of these genes.

in most cases, targets of the same mirna belong to the same gene family ; however, some mirnas, such as gma-mir <dig>  can target three types of genes, including copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, mtn19-like protein and serine-type endopeptidase . in previous reports  <cit> , sucrose-inducible mir <dig> was found to decrease expressions of two copper superoxide dismutase genes and a copper chaperone gene in arabidopsis and rice. the copper superoxide dismutase gene was also found to be sliced by mir <dig> in soybean in our research . it seems likely that the role of mirna <dig> in the regulation of copper superoxide dismutase genes is conserved among arabidopsis, rice and soybean. two other genes were also identified as gma-mir <dig> targets; one is a serine-type endopeptidase and the other is an mtn19-like protein induced by bruchin treatment  <cit>  . therefore, gma-mir <dig> may perform additional functions in soybean by targeting more genes.

target genes of soybean- or legume-specific mirnas primarily belong to class iii and class iv, and these mirnas regulate fewer targets than conserved mirnas do . the target of gma-mir <dig> was found to be a transketolase gene , the product of which may participate in the calvin cycle of photosynthesis. the calvin cycle converts carbon dioxide into organic substances in plants; this process is known as carbon fixation. therefore, the gma-mir <dig> may regulate carbon assimilation in soybean. however, the gma-mir <dig> was also identified from soybean root  <cit> . two auxin induced transcription factors were also detected as targets of gma-mir <dig>  but their signature abundance was much lower . considering that the degradome library was constructed using developing soybean seeds, the gma-mir <dig> may be responsible for the switch from carbon assimilation to energy metabolism during seed development by silencing the transketolase gene. however, it is possible that the gma-mir <dig> targets may also participate in root development.

targets of new mirnas from soybean
in addition to identification of the targets for known mirnas , targets of new mirnas were investigated in this study . the verification of mirna targets provides further evidence for the existence of new mirnas in soybean. we identified target genes for  <dig> new mirnas ; these targets belonged mainly to class iii and class iv, like the targets of soybean or legume-specific mirnas .

unlike conserved mirnas, the targets of new soybean mirnas were not enriched in transcription factors . many target genes, such as g-protein and endomembrane protein, are likely involved in signal transduction, implying that the corresponding new mirnas may participate in some specific developmental processes in soybean. pentatricopeptide repeat proteins  were detected as the targets of soy_ <dig> and soy_ <dig>  ppr-containing proteins perform functions at the post-transcriptional level in mitochondria and chloroplasts and are widely distributed in higher plants but absent in prokaryotes and archaebacteria  <cit> . they regulate gene expression in plant organelles through many processes, including rna editing, cleavage and splicing. soy_ <dig> and soy_ <dig> may regulate plant organelle development by silencing genes encoding pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins.

interestingly, the soybean homolog  of arabidopsis suppressor of gene sliencing  <dig>  was detected as the target of soy_ <dig> . sgs <dig> was required for defense against virus infection through posttranscriptional gene silencing  in plants  <cit> . atsgs <dig> participates not only in mrna degradation, but also in dna methylation. loss of function of atsgs <dig> could reduce production of trans-acting sirna in arabidopsis  <cit> . the v <dig> protein of tomato yellow leaf curl virus could interact with tomato sgs <dig> to suppress rna silencing for virus infection  <cit> . in addition to sgs <dig>  soybean argonaute  proteins , another important component in mirna- or sirna-mediated ptgs, were cleaved by conserved gma-mir <dig> . regulation of the ago gene by mir <dig> was validated in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> .

go analysis of targets
all targets regulated by soybean annotated mirnas and new mirnas identified in this study were subjected to agrigo toolkit analysis to investigate gene ontology  <cit> . to date,  <dig>  soybean genes have been annotated in the agrigo database, and  <dig> soybean mirna targets were recognized for go analysis . as seen in figure  <dig>  more than 80% of these genes are involved in metabolic process, and reproduction-related genes were more enriched in mirna targets than in soybean total genes. the enrichment of the genes involved in metabolic and reproductive processes may be consistent with the fact that both the small rna and the degradome libraries were constructed from developing soybean seeds. the accumulation of dry matter for seed germination is the main task of developing seeds, and a large number of target genes may participate in these processes. the known and new mirnas identified in this study may regulate expression of these target genes to control seed development and energy storage in soybeans.

discussion
as regulators of gene expression, mirnas are widely present in animals and plants  <cit> . there are  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas annotated in arabidopsis and rice, respectively, according to the mirbase database  <cit> . soybean is an ancient polyploid  crop plant, with a more complex and larger genome than arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . in total,  <dig> soybean mirnas were annotated in the mirbase database. in this study,  <dig> new mirnas were identified in soybean by deep sequencing and validated by experimental approaches. functional elucidation and target analysis of the conserved and non-conserved mirnas could yield more clues to the different regulations of gene expressions between species.

we further studied the target genes of the mirnas by degradome library sequencing. unlike other species studied by degradome sequencing  <cit> , in the soybean genome, only 40% of solexa reads could be mapped to a single position. previous reports showed soybean to be an ancient polyploidy, and the genome duplicated twice,  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . most genes have multiple copies in the genome. in addition, the tags from degradome sequencing have only  <dig> or  <dig> nt. therefore, the proportion of single mapped reads was not as high as that in other degradome sequencing. extending the length of sequencing tag may improve this proportion.

because of the high throughput of deep sequencing, a large number of reads that were not mirna-directed cleavage products were detected in class iii and class iv. these cleavages may have been derived from cleavage by other unidentified soybean mirnas. conserved mirnas silence more targets than soybean-specific mirnas. it is possible that conserved mirnas play a key role in universal mechanisms of regulation in different plant species;, however, soybean-specific mirnas may function only in regulation of gene expression during legume- or soybean-specific processes. although the conserved mirnas mainly regulate genes encoding transcription factors, soybean-specific mirnas regulate various types of genes, suggesting a new feature of mirna regulation in soybeans.

as the small rna library was prepared from soybean developing seeds, the mirnas with detected target genes should take part in regulation of seed development. although most of the soybean genes were not annotated clearly, some targets related to seed development were identified in this study. the soybean seed is a storage organ, containing significant amounts of lipid and protein. energy metabolism is very active during development of seeds, especially in chloroplasts. in the early stages of soybean seed development, photosynthesis occurs in seed chloroplasts. subsequently, lipid accumulation becomes the major function of chloroplasts in seeds. genes encoding transketolase and carboxylase in these processes were identified as gma-mir <dig> and gma-mir <dig> targets, respectively. genes encoding ppr-containing proteins, which regulate gene expression in mitochondria and chloroplasts, were also regulated by some mirnas. these mirnas may affect conversion between photosynthesis and lipid accumulation in seeds by regulating genes related to metabolism and chloroplast development. moreover, comparison of mirna abundance in seeds and other organs of soybeans should uncover those mirnas specifically expressed in seeds. identification of the corresponding target genes and study of their roles will elucidate possible functions of mirnas and target genes in relevant processes of seed development.

only a few annotated conserved mirnas were found to have no soybean target genes; however, many non-conserved mirnas did not appear to silence any targets. mirnas regulate gene expression not only by mrna cleavage but also by translation repression. the mirnas with no detected targets may silence genes by repressing translation. however, we could not obtain information about translation repression by mirna through degradome sequencing. other methods may be used to detect such a possibility, e.g., co-expression of mirna and the predicted target in n. benthamiana leaves  <cit> . some non-conserved mirnas are hard to detect because of low abundance or spatial expression pattern. to get more integrated information on mirna targets, degradome libraries from different tissues, organs and different developmental stages should be constructed. additionally, some mirnas also function in methylation of genomic dna or histones. more attention should be paid to the mechanism of methylation via mirna to clarify other functions of mirna.

in higher plants, mirnas function mainly through silencing related gene expression. identification of mirna targets will help us to understand the biological effects of mirna. by deep sequencing of a degradome library, we identified a large number of target genes regulated by corresponding mirnas . these targets contained not only conserved families of mirna target genes, such as myb, arf, nac, grf and tcp-type transcription factor gene families, but also non-conserved target genes, such as g-protein, sgs <dig> and f-box protein. the conserved targets may participate in various aspects of plant development and stress responses as in other plants and may help us to understand evolutionary relationships between soybean and other plants. global identification of non-conserved targets provides useful information to explore the new functions of mirnas in soybean. the regulation of sgs <dig> by mirna was not found in previous studies. further study of the relationship between sgs <dig> and the new mirna soy_ <dig> should reveal the function of this pair in regulation of mirna biogenesis and/or seed development in soybean and other plants.

CONCLUSIONS
in our study, a small rna library and a degradome library were constructed from developing soybean seeds for deep sequencing. we identified  <dig> new mirnas in soybean by bioinformatic analysis and experimental tests. the mirna star sequences of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> new mirnas were also discovered, providing additional evidence for the existence of mirnas. degradome sequencing as a high-throughput approach for mirna target detection was applied to identify mirna targets in soybean. in total,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as targets of annotated mirnas and new mirnas, respectively. construction of degradome libraries from different developmental stages of seeds should reveal more targets of soybean mirnas. overall, global identification of soybean mirna targets in this study provides more information about the regulatory network of mirnas in soybean, and it will advance our understanding of mirna functions during seed development.
