BACKGROUND
s. aureus is a frequent human colonizer and major pathogen. besides its pathogenicity and virulence potential, the development and/or acquisition of resistance to antimicrobials  is of foremost importance, as the occurrence of strains with a multidrug resistance  phenotype is common. in particular, methicillin-resistant s. aureus  strains have become a major problem in healthcare settings and in the community  <cit>  as they are generally associated with increased burden regarding therapeutics and higher mortality rates than methicillin-susceptible s. aureus  strains  <cit> .

fluoroquinolones target the s. aureus topoisomerase iv  and dna gyrase , inhibiting dna replication  <cit> . resistance to these antibiotics emerges swiftly and has been mainly attributed to the occurrence of spontaneous mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region  of the target genes grla/b and gyra/b  <cit> . in europe, around 25 % of invasive s. aureus clinical isolates are resistant to fluoroquinolones, a rate that increases to almost 90 % among mrsa isolates  <cit> . although fluoroquinolones are not used for the treatment of staphylococcal infections, their intensive use in the hospital  <cit>  has been pointed out as a main selective factor for the emergence and dissemination of fluoroquinolone resistance in s. aureus, which, in turn, has been suggested to act as a selective advantage for mrsa strains in comparison with mssa strains  <cit> .

resistance to fluoroquinolones may also arise by their extrusion via efflux pumps   <cit> , as reported in s. aureus clinical isolates  but considered clinically non-relevant  <cit> . several multidrug eps have been identified in s. aureus, including nora, norb, norc, mepa and mdea  <cit> . the few studies conducted to ascertain their contribution to fluoroquinolone resistance have associated their activity to a reduced susceptibility to this class of antibiotics . moreover, this same efflux activity could be linked to decreased susceptibility to additional antimicrobials such as biocides and dyes  <cit> , highlighting the potential of these eps to convey a mdr phenotype to s. aureus strains.

recent studies provided additional data supporting the premise that efflux plays an important role in the emergence of resistance to antimicrobials in bacteria. indeed, data from escherichia coli and mycobacterium tuberculosis demonstrate that efflux may be the cell’s first response to cope with these compounds, allowing them to endure their noxious effects until acquisition of a more stable resistance mechanism, such as mutation, that will then provide high-level resistance  <cit> . studies on s. aureus also demonstrated the role of efflux as a first-line defence mechanism towards noxious compounds  <cit> , a hypothesis that has been confirmed in clinical isolates .

in this study, we aimed to highlight the relationship between efflux and mutation throughout the process of emergence of resistance in s. aureus, by exposing a set of representative mssa and mrsa strains to sub-inhibitory or inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials that are known substrates of mdr eps: the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin , the biocide cetrimide  and the dye ethidium bromide . the three strains studied included a fully susceptible reference mssa strain and a pair of closely related clinical mrsa strains resistant to ciprofloxacin, which carry the same set of qrdr mutations but that differ in their efflux activity. the expression of genes coding for the main mdr eps and their regulators was assessed at different time points of exposure and correlated with the resistance level towards fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobials and the temporal acquisition of mutations.

RESULTS
exposure of mssa and mrsa strains to fluoroquinolones and biocides promotes a multidrug efflux response
the reference mssa strain atcc <dig> and two clinical mrsa strains, sm <dig> and sm <dig>  belonging to st2246-t <dig> , were each subjected to six different exposure regimens for a period of 20-days: exposure to the minimum inhibitory concentration  and to half mic of etbr, cip and cet . bacterial growth was observed in the presence of the mic of each compound during day  <dig> of most exposure regimens, albeit at different growth rates , probably due to: a) the different growth conditions used in comparison to the mic determination protocol and b) the initial gradual physiological adaptation and survival of bacteria to the mic of the antimicrobial to which they were exposed.

occurrence of contaminations was ruled out by pfge analysis of smai macrorestriction profiles of the strains before  and after  each exposure experiment .

changes in the susceptibility profiles of the strains were monitored by determination of mics of the ep substrates during exposure . we observed an overall mic increase from two-fold to 16-fold, although exposure to the mic did not always result in the highest levels of resistance . etbr and cip promoted higher mic increases  than cet . the strains responsiveness to the ep substrates differed according to their initial efflux activity  <cit> ; strains sm <dig> and atcc <dig> , showed higher mic increases than strain sm <dig> , which was the least responsive strain. moreover, absence of growth was observed for strain sm <dig> exposed to the cetrimide mic .fig.  <dig> evolution of mic values  of the ep substrates for the strains in study. the data presented correspond to the mics of ethidium bromide , ciprofloxacin  and cetrimide  throughout the 20-day exposure to etbr , cip  and cet  at half mic  or at the mic  . no growth was obtained for strain sm <dig> at the cet concentration corresponding to the mic



the data shown in fig.  <dig> revealed that, in most cases, the mic increases occurred in the first days of exposure, and in some conditions, more swiftly in the presence of the mic of the ep substrate . strikingly, the three strains achieved similar final mics of etbr and cet  independently of the exposure condition . of particular interest, exposure of strain atcc <dig> to each ep substrate determined an increase in the mic values of fluoroquinolones, namely from  <dig>  to 2 mg/l for cip; from  <dig>  to ≥ 8 mg/l for norfloxacin and from  <dig>  to  <dig> -1 mg/l for levofloxacin, with the exception of exposure to cet at half mic . in contrast, no significant alterations in susceptibility level were found for the other antibiotics tested: oxacillin; penicillin; vancomycin; chloramphenicol and tetracycline.

the exposure experiments also resulted in increased resistance to the quaternary ammonium compounds cetylpyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride and dequalinium chloride; to tetraphenylphosphonium bromide; to the diamidine pentamidine and in a lesser extent to the bisbiguanidine chlorhexidine .

the next set of experiments confirmed that the mdr phenotypes observed were associated with increased efflux, as assessed by mic determinations in the presence of the efflux inhibitors thioridazine   and verapamil  . it has been suggested that a four-fold mic reduction in the presence of an efflux inhibitor indicates inhibition of increased efflux activity  <cit> . in this work, we observed that tz and ver were able to reduce the increased mics of etbr, cip and cet by two to 32-fold . this inhibitory effect was more pronounced for strains atcc <dig> and sm <dig> exposed to etbr.table  <dig> effect of tz on ep substrates mics before and after the exposure processes

the efflux activity of each exposed strain was further evaluated by real-time fluorometry . the slope of each etbr efflux curve was determined and correlated to the rate of efflux, as well as the relative index of efflux activity , which corresponds to the exposed cells overall capacity to efflux etbr relatively to their original status. the initial efflux activity of each strain is indicated in orange in fig.  <dig> and confirms that the initial basal and naive efflux activity of both atcc <dig> and sm <dig> was lower than that of sm <dig> . most of the conditions tested resulted in increased efflux activity, with the exception of strains exposed to the sub-inhibitory concentrations of cet and atcc <dig> exposed to cip. also, in most cases, higher etbr efflux  was detected with the highest concentrations of substrate .fig.  <dig> assessment of etbr efflux for the strains in study. efflux capacity was evaluated at the beginning  and at the end of the exposure process to ethidium bromide , ciprofloxacin  and cetrimide  at half mic  and at the mic . all assays were conducted in the presence of  <dig>  % glucose. etbr-loaded cells were obtained by incubation with 200 mg/l of ver plus the following etbr concentrations:  <dig>  mg/l _p <dig>  cip_p <dig>  cet_ p20; sm2: p <dig>  cet_p20; sm50_cet_p20);  <dig>  mg/l _p <dig>  cet_p20; sm2: cet_p <dig>  cet_p20; sm50: p <dig>  etbr_p <dig>  etbr_p <dig>  cip_p20);  <dig>  mg/l _p20; sm2: etbr_p <dig>  etbr_p <dig>  cip_p20; sm50_cip_p20). the data presented was normalized against the data obtained in conditions of no efflux . the slope  of the etbr efflux curves was calculated by a linear regression of the values obtained in the first minutes of the assay and it relates to the rate of etbr efflux in each condition tested. the relative index of efflux activity  values were calculated as described in methods and allow the direct comparison of the etbr efflux activity of the strain after exposure  to their initial efflux activity 



altogether, these data revealed that increased antimicrobial resistance in all the exposed strains correlates with an augmented efflux capacity induced by the contact with substrates of multidrug eps.

evaluation of ep gene expression levels
to ascertain which eps were responsible for the induced mdr phenotypes, we measured the expression levels of the s. aureus mdr ep genes nora, norb, norc, mdea and mepa, as well as their regulatory genes mgra and mepr, at different stages of exposure. changes in gene expression were considered an early response when occurring during day  <dig> of exposure, and a late response when detected at day  <dig> .fig.  <dig> expression levels of ep and regulator genes of the strains in study during exposure to etbr. gene expression was measured in the presence of etbr at half mic  and at the mic  relatively to the drug-free growth condition. the results are presented as the mean and standard deviation of at least two independent assays performed with total rna. overexpression was considered for values superior to  <dig>

exposure to etbr
figure  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> illustrate a similar genetic response for all strains to etbr, consisting of an early response with low overexpression levels of nor genes , and a late response with reduction of expression levels and/or a shift in the genes overexpressed . this late and specific response via mepa/mepr genes was consistently observed at half mic of etbr for the three strains. in contrast, at the mic, only atcc <dig> showed overexpression of norb and mepa/mepr whereas in strains sm <dig> and sm <dig> only increased expression of nora was detected.

exposure to ciprofloxacin
a different genetic response was detected under exposure to cip . compared to etbr exposure, lower levels of gene expression were found at either cip concentration tested. an exception was strain atcc <dig>  which presented an early response to the cip mic consisting of increased expression of all genes, in particular mepa/mepr . in contrast, the two cip-resistant strains sm <dig> and sm <dig> showed a predominance of nor genes overexpression in both early and late responses, which varied with the concentration and over time .

exposure to cetrimide
exposure to cet also produced different patterns of gene expression . strain atcc <dig> presented a strong early response when exposed to the mic, with high levels of expression for all the genes tested, while no changes in expression were seen on exposure to half mic. the two clinical strains had very different expression patterns. sm <dig> revealed a strong early response, with increased expression of nearly all genes tested followed by a weak late response, mediated by mdea or norc, depending on the concentration used. conversely, sm <dig> showed only a low level overexpression of the nor genes either in the early  or late  response.

screening for the emergence of mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones
the occurrence of mutations associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones was screened by analysis of the qrdr of grla and gyra genes for the strains exposed to ciprofloxacin. the cip-susceptible strain atcc <dig>  contains a wild-type gyra but carries a mutation in grla, p144s, which has been reported for some s. aureus isolates with a cip mic of  <dig>  mg/l  <cit> , thus not associated with resistance. this strain did not gain mutations throughout exposure to half mic of ciprofloxacin. however, exposure to the ciprofloxacin mic resulted in an increased cip mic of 2 mg/l  and the acquisition of the mutation s80f in grla, while gyra remained unchanged. screening of the grla qrdr of this strain in intermediate stages of the exposure process revealed that this mutation occurred at day  <dig>  this mutation is one of the most commonly ascribed to grla in s. aureus clinical isolates and has been associated with ciprofloxacin resistance levels that vary between  <dig> and  <dig>  mg/l  <cit> , corresponding to resistance according to clsi and eucast guidelines  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of thioridazine on the ciprofloxacin mic for the strains exposed to ep substrates. mic values were determined for each strain prior to exposure  and after each exposure process  in the absence  and in the presence  of the efflux inhibitor thioridazine  at the sub-inhibitory concentration of  <dig>  mg/l. the strain atcc <dig> exposed to the ciprofloxacin mic was the single one in which a fluoroquinolone-resistance mutation  occurred during an exposure process . the breakpoint for considering intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin  is represented by a blue dashed line



importantly, atcc <dig> strain also revealed a final cip mic of 2 mg/l following exposure to etbr and cet  but without any detectable occurrence of mutations in the qrdr of grla/gyra genes, indicating that in these exposure conditions, the increased fluoroquinolone resistance was solely due to augmented efflux.

the cip-resistant strains sm <dig> and sm <dig> already carried by the time of their isolation a double mutation in grla  accompanied by a single mutation in gyra , a combination associated with high level resistance to ciprofloxacin   <cit> . the qrdr region of their grla/gyra genes was also sequenced after cip exposure, but no additional mutations were detected, indicating that the observed increased resistance to fluoroquinolones  is solely attributable to increased efflux activity, as confirmed by the results with efflux inhibitors . screening for mutations in the strains exposed to etbr and cet also showed that no mutations occurred during those exposure processes.

screening for the emergence of mutations in nora and mgra promoters
the occurrence of mutations in the nora promoter region has been frequently associated with nora overexpression  <cit> . therefore, we screened for mutations in nora promoter for exposed strains showing nora overexpression either in an early- or late-response. different mutations were encountered , all already described by other authors  <cit> , which included the transitions a → g and t → c and the transversion a → t, at positions − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig>  relatively to translation start. a duplication event resulting in the insertion of the sequence caatatag in the − <dig> consensus motif was also encountered. of these mutations, only the transversion a → t  in strain sm <dig> exposed to cip mic and the duplication event for strain sm <dig> exposed to the etbr mic were associated with nora overexpression at the 20th day of exposure.fig.  <dig> location of the nora promoter mutations found in nora overexpressing strains following antimicrobial exposure. the nucleotides are numbered taking into consideration the nora starting codon. mgra binding sites are identified by black lines. the consensus motifs − <dig> and − <dig> are also identified in black lines. the symbol * identifies the nucleotide − <dig>  which is absent in sm <dig> and sm <dig> nora promoter sequence. the sites of is <dig> insertion within the nora promoter region of strain sm <dig> exposed to cet or etbr mic are also indicated 



an unexpected result was the independent detection of the insertion element is <dig> in the nora promoter region of strain sm <dig> upon exposure to the mic of etbr, between the consensus motifs − <dig> and − <dig>  and to the mic of cet, upstream of the promoter region and mgra binding sites, with a probable association with increased nora expression only in the former. rapid screening revealed that no is <dig> insertion had taken place in the promoter regions of norb and norc in strain sm <dig>  despite detection of increased expression of these two genes .

no mutations were identified in the promoter region of mgra for mgra overexpressing strains, although a copy of is <dig> was detected upstream of the mgra putative promoter region in unexposed sm <dig> and sm <dig> strains, which may have affected mgra expression and consequently, of genes regulated by mgra, namely nora/b/c.

despite the observed overexpression of mepa/mepr of strains atcc <dig> and sm <dig> exposed to etbr, no mutations were found in the promoter region of the mepra operon . however, the mutation e32k was detected in the regulator protein mepr for strain sm <dig> exposed to etbr, which may affect mepr function.

discussion
antimicrobial resistance is one of the most critical challenges of our time. several studies have revealed that resistance mediated by efflux is an important component of antimicrobial resistance in s. aureus clinical isolates . the purpose of the present study was to disclose the impact of efflux on emergence of antimicrobial resistance, by exploring the effect of different antimicrobials at different concentrations and times of exposure in a group of representative strains, which included both mssa and mrsa strains. our aim was to provide a better understanding of the contribution of each multidrug ep to resistance and to gain further insights in the process of development of efflux-mediated resistance to antimicrobials in s. aureus and its relationship with mutation-based resistance. the study was restricted to three representative, well characterized strains, in order to allow a comprehensive interpretation of the patterns obtained. the strains selected were s. aureus atcc <dig>  a fully susceptible reference strain, and two mrsa clinical strains that belong to a nosocomial clone that has been detected in this major lisbon hospital  <cit> , st2246-t <dig> , differing in their initial efflux activity  <cit> .

the results obtained clearly suggest that long-term exposure of mssa  and mrsa  strains to the selected ep substrates resulted in the development of a mdr phenotype, with increased resistance to these agents as well as cross-resistance to other antimicrobials . the mdr phenotype emerged independently of the ep substrate, its concentration and the strain’s initial susceptibility phenotype or efflux capacity.

the emergence of an efflux-mediated mdr phenotype upon exposure to antimicrobials has also been observed in previous studies  <cit> , showing that exposure to a substrate of a multidrug ep promotes cross-resistance to other substrates of the same ep. this behavior towards selective pressure was also observed by furi et al.  <cit> . one of the most important findings of this work was that the challenge of a susceptible strain, atcc <dig>  by constant sub-inhibitory or inhibitory concentrations of non-fluoroquinolone agents, particularly cetrimide, promoted cross-resistance to fluoroquinolones, revealing the potential role of these agents as a selective pressure for the emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in healthcare environments.

the genetic responsiveness of the strains to the different ep substrates suggests a temporal differentiation in the activation of mdr ep genes . first, an early-response, occurring throughout day  <dig> of exposure, where the strains responded in a strong and non-specific manner by increasing the expression of several ep genes. this was followed by a more specific late-response, which occurred following prolonged exposure to the stimulus, in which the number of ep genes overexpressed and/or their level of expression decreased. this reduction in expression levels may occur because the number of ep proteins in the cell membrane required to cope with the antimicrobials may have reached a maximum value, suggesting that the reduced expression level observed at day  <dig> may be the necessary to compensate for protein turnover.

in a closer look, different patterns of gene expression were found. some genes were predominantly overexpressed upon exposure to etbr and cip , in accordance with the substrate profile described for these mdr eps  <cit> . regarding cet, a preferable expression pattern of ep genes could not be established since a strong response with several genes was observed. this non-specific response may reflect the broader effect that this membrane-active compound exerts upon the bacterial cell  <cit> , which triggers a global stress response. a correlation between the substrate concentration and increased gene expression was only observed for strain atcc <dig>  which was independent of the substrate. for the clinical strains sm <dig> and sm <dig>  increasing concentrations of ep substrates did not result in a stronger nor earlier response.

although the results obtained for these three strains cannot be over generalized, they clearly show an overall pattern of s. aureus responsiveness upon challenge with antimicrobials, which is efflux driven and build upon each strain characteristics and may assist the design of future studies on antimicrobial resistance prevention. this overall response was less pronounced for sm <dig>  the only strain which presented an initial well-established increased efflux activity. this difference translated in the distinct behaviour of both clinical strains in response to etbr and cet. while strain sm <dig> presented a strong early response with overexpression and de novo expression of several ep genes, the response of sm <dig> was comparably weaker . this dissimilar behavior is particularly striking as these are very closely related strains, as demonstrated by pfge analysis and illustrates the multiple efflux-mediated responses that s. aureus can display within the same lineage, a finding in contrast to results from other studies  <cit> . regarding the response to cip, both strains  showed mild values of ep gene overexpression, which may account for the additional level of resistance attributed to efflux. previous data suggested that clinical strains are primed to efflux noxious compounds, a trait that may be attributable to their prior exposure to antimicrobials in the hospital environment  <cit> . the susceptible reference strain atcc <dig>  with an initial basal efflux activity, presented a behavior similar to sm <dig>  with strong responses to all three substrates. this is a prototype strain with no prior exposure to antimicrobials and not primed for efflux, thus requiring higher levels of ep gene expression to cope with the noxious agents. in a previous work, exposure of atcc <dig> to etbr triggered a preferred induction of the nora gene  <cit> , whereas in the present study a mepa-mediated response to etbr was noted. this difference could be due to the different exposure methodology used . these data support previous findings suggesting that the same strain may respond to the same substrate via different efflux systems, depending on the concentration of the substrate and time of contact  <cit> .

screening for mutations in nora promoter region revealed that stable nora overexpression was correlated with the occurrence of mutations in its promoter region. most striking, we could also observe the insertion of the is <dig> element in the nora and mgra promoter regions, although not always associated with increased gene expression. multiple is <dig> transpositions have been observed in the genome of s. aureus and correlated with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, as a copy of is <dig> was found in the promoter region of genes associated with glycopeptide resistance originating hybrid promoters, probably responsible for an increased gene expression  <cit> . other studies have also shown that exposure to antibiotics such as cip, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, linezolid and spectinomycin activates spontaneous transposition of is <dig> which could be associated with a decrease of antibiotic susceptibility . moreover, it has been shown that is <dig> insertion in the promoter regions of the genes meca in staphylococcus sciuri  <cit>  and llm in s. aureus  <cit>  is involved in higher transcription rates of both genes with a concomitant increased resistance to methicillin. in this study, we show that exposure to non-antibiotics may also activate spontaneous transposition of is <dig> and that nora and mgra promoters may be hot spots for is <dig> insertion , an event that, to our knowledge, is here described for the first time, further supporting the important role of efflux on the global s. aureus stress response.

the evolution of the susceptibility profile and gene expression analysis upon exposure demonstrated that efflux is a first-line response to antimicrobials. for the two clinical strains, it was demonstrated that efflux is an important component of resistance as these ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, harboring resistance mutations prior to exposure, became even more resistant to these antibiotics, not by acquiring additional mutations but by increasing their efflux activity. this observation was empathized by the inclusion of a fully susceptible reference strain for which the acquisition of fluoroquinolone resistance mutations follows the activation of eps, which confer a low but clinically significant level of resistance that allows survival of bacteria even under mic exposure. significantly, this same resistance phenotype could be achieved by exposure to non-fluoroquinolone antimicrobials. these findings provide further evidence that efflux is an important player in the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in s. aureus.

CONCLUSIONS
the last decade witnessed a growing awareness of the clinical importance of efflux as a mechanism of resistance to antimicrobial compounds. in recent years, a new perspective on the role played by mdr efflux systems has been emphasized, which are now perceived as important players in the emergence of resistance in bacteria  <cit> . in addition, a wide number of toxic compounds have been identified as substrates of these systems  <cit> . the findings of this study show that mdr ep substrates, including fluoroquinolones and biocides, compounds that are commonly used in hospital environments, promote a physiological response by s. aureus, which is based on efflux and persists over time with the maintenance of the stimulus. in the case of the pan-susceptible atcc <dig> strain, this efflux-mediated response resulted in detectable resistance to fluoroquinolones, in a step-wise process; a first step with activation of multidrug ep genes followed by a second step with acquisition of qrdr mutations. these are promising results, as they establish the key role of efflux in the first-line response to these antimicrobial agents until more stable and efficient forms of resistance appear. moreover, they suggest that exposure to non-fluoroquinolone agents may act as selective pressure for the maintenance and dissemination of fluoroquinolone resistance, reportedly a selective factor for the persistence of mrsa strains in the hospital  <cit> .
