BACKGROUND
huntington disease  is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from a trinucleotide cag expansion in the hd gene. while the expression of mutant htt is sufficient to cause hd-like symptoms with normal expression levels of wild-type htt  <cit> , recent data suggests that decreased levels of wild-type htt in hd patients may also contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of hd  <cit> . in support of this, we have recently demonstrated that the loss of wild-type htt in yac <dig> mice significantly worsens motor performance, survival and striatal neuronal size  <cit> .

htt function is essential for development as mice homozygous for the targeted inactivation of the mouse hd gene are embryonic lethal  <cit> . furthermore, decreasing htt levels by 50% or more from birth results in neurological abnormalities  <cit> . the expression of wild-type htt is also essential postnatally as mice expressing decreased levels of wild-type htt in the forebrain beginning at postnatal day  <dig> were shown to have a progressive neurological phenotype  <cit> . clearly, decreased wild-type htt levels alone can lead to phenotypic abnormalities independent of mutant htt.

as the functions of wild-type htt become more clear, it seems that one of the most critical functions for htt may be in promoting neuronal survival. in vitro studies have demonstrated that the over-expression of wild-type htt protects cells against various insults including 3-nitroproprionic acid, a toxin which damages the striatum and has been used to model hd  <cit> . it has also been shown that over-expression of wild-type htt can specifically protect against polyglutamine toxicity in vitro  <cit> . this finding has been extended in vivo where increased expression of wild-type htt eliminated apoptotic degeneration in the testis caused by the expression of mutant htt  <cit> . the mechanism by which htt protects neurons may be direct by sequestration of the pro-apoptotic protein hip- <dig>  <cit>  or indirectly mediated through htt's effect on expression and transport within the cell as htt has been shown to be involved in both the transcription and movement of the brain derived neurotrophic factor  <cit> . in contrast, fragments of mutant htt have been shown to also protect against some forms of injury  through a different mechanism, likely the induction of a stress response  <cit> .

in hd, there is evidence that striatal neurons die through excitotoxic mechanisms  <cit> . as such, we have previously examined the ability of htt to protect neurons in vivo against two different excitotoxic neurotoxins. for these experiments, we used yac <dig> mice that over-express htt from a yeast artificial chromosome containing the entire human hd gene with  <dig> cag repeats  <cit> . after intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid, yac <dig> mice showed dramatically less neuronal loss in the hippocampus compared to wt controls  <cit> . similarly, yac <dig> mice showed significant, htt dose-dependent protection against lesions caused by intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid  <cit> .

based on the clear demonstration of in vivo protection against excitotoxic cell death in yac <dig> mice and the general protective effect of wild-type htt that has been demonstrated in vitro, we designed this experiment to determine if the over-expression of wild-type htt would be beneficial in treating hd. since hd patients have at least a 50% genetic reduction in wild-type htt levels , it is plausible that this decrease in htt's neuroprotective function will make neurons more susceptible to the toxicity of mutant htt. a decrease in wild-type htt levels may also affect htt's role in transcription and transport within the cell  <cit> . in fact many of htt's assayable functions have been shown to be disrupted by polyglutamine expansion  <cit>  and polyglutamine expansion also alters htt's ability to interact with its interacting proteins  <cit> . thus, treatment of hd with wild-type htt may be beneficial by compensating for the loss of wild-type htt function and or through htt's general neuroprotective effect.

for this experiment we used the yac <dig> mouse model of hd which recapitulates many aspects of the human disease  <cit> . these mice exhibit progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment and selective neurodegeneration. yac <dig> mice were crossed to yac <dig> mice  to generate yac <dig> mice that over-express wild-type htt . we show that over-expression of wild-type htt in yac <dig> mice results in a mild improvement in striatal neuropathology but does not improve motor dysfunction.

RESULTS
generation of yac <dig> mice that over-express wild-type huntingtin
to determine whether wild-type htt could protect against mutant htt toxicity in the brain, we crossed yac <dig> mice with yac <dig> mice to generate yac <dig> mice that over-express wild-type htt . in order to maximize the amount of neuroprotection imparted by over-expression of wild-type htt, we used the highest expressing yac <dig> line  available. we have previously shown that yac <dig> line  <dig> mice express wild-type htt at 2â€“ <dig> times endogenous levels  <cit>  and exhibit the greatest degree of neuroprotection against quinolinic acid toxicity of all the yac <dig> lines  <cit> . to confirm the high expression of htt in line  <dig> mice, we examined total wild-type huntingtin in line  <dig> and wt mice by western blotting with polyclonal bkp <dig> antibody  <cit> . as previously reported, we found that line  <dig> mice express wild-type htt at levels that are more than two times the level of wild-type htt expression in wt mice .

after breeding yac <dig> and yac <dig> mice together, yac18/ <dig> mice were generated in equal proportions to wt, yac <dig> and yac <dig> mice indicating normal embryonic survival. since the yac transgenes used to generate yac <dig> and yac <dig> mice express human htt, we examined transgenic htt expression with the human specific htt antibody, hd <dig> . we also examined total htt expression using mab <dig> which detects both mouse and human htt . as expected, wt mice  express wild-type mouse htt and no human htt. yac <dig> mice express increased levels of wild-type htt which are accounted for by increased human htt expression. yac <dig> mice express wild-type htt at the same level as wt mice and human mutant htt. finally, yac18/ <dig> mice express increased levels of wild-type htt and mutant human htt. importantly, the level of mutant htt expression was equal between the yac <dig> and yac18/ <dig> mice indicating that the over-expression of wild-type htt did not down-regulate the expression of mutant htt .

over-expression of wild-type huntingtin does not improve motor function in yac <dig> mice
to examine the effect of wild-type htt on the motor dysfunction present in the yac <dig> mice, we monitored motor coordination on the rotarod from  <dig> to  <dig> months of age. while anova revealed an overall effect of genotype on rotarod performance  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , n =  <dig> wt,  <dig> yac <dig>   <dig> yac <dig>   <dig> yac18/128), there were no significant differences between the yac <dig> mice and yac18/ <dig> at any time point . both groups performed significantly worse than wt mice .

we have previously reported early hyperactivity and late hypoactivity in yac <dig> mice compared to wt mice  <cit> . as such, we compared the activity of yac18/ <dig> mice and yac <dig> mice at  <dig> and  <dig> months of age to determine if wild-type htt expression could ameliorate the abnormal activity pattern present in yac <dig> mice. we observed no significant improvement in activity in yac18/ <dig> mice compared to yac <dig> mice . overall, increasing wild-type htt expression did not provide a significant behavioural benefit to yac <dig> mice.

while this study was not powered to demonstrate significant differences in survival, the number of yac18/ <dig> mice surviving to  <dig> months was similar to what we normally observe in yac <dig> mice .

mice surviving to  <dig> months of age were sacrificed and we examined brain and testicular weight as these have been shown to be decreased in yac <dig> mice  <cit> . in both cases, there was a significant difference between yac <dig> and wt mice which was not improved by the over-expression of wild-type htt . unexpectedly, the testicular weight in yac18/ <dig> mice was significantly less than in yac <dig> mice and there was a trend towards decreased testicular weight in yac <dig> mice compared to wt. this suggests the possibility that high levels of htt expression may be detrimental in the testis.

over-expression of wild-type huntingtin results in mild improvement in striatal neuropathology in yac <dig> mice
yac <dig> mice demonstrate clear striatal neuropathology at  <dig> months of age with decreased striatal volume, striatal neuronal loss, striatal neuronal atrophy and decreased striatal darpp- <dig> expression  <cit> . to determine whether the expression of wild-type htt could ameliorate these striatal phenotypes we examined the striata of yac18/ <dig> mice. comparing yac18/ <dig> mice and yac <dig> mice revealed no significant improvement in striatal volume , striatal neuronal numbers  or striatal darpp- <dig> expression  with increased wild-type htt expression. in each case, yac <dig> mice showed significant abnormalities compared to wt mice. in contrast, increasing wild-type htt expression in yac <dig> mice resulted in a significant reduction in striatal neuronal atrophy  with the striatal neuronal cross-sectional area in yac18/ <dig> mice being almost restored to wild-type .

discussion
based on recent work demonstrating a neuroprotective function of wild-type htt and suggestions that loss of wild-type htt function contributes to hd pathogenesis, we investigated the therapeutic potential of wild-type htt in the yac <dig> mouse model of hd. we found that over-expression of wild-type htt in yac <dig> mice resulted in a mild improvement in striatal neuropathology with no significant improvement in behavioural phenotypes.

the effect of over-expression of wild-type htt in yac <dig> mice is summarized in table  <dig>  a robust finding of this study was that over-expression of wild-type htt in yac <dig> mice restored striatal neuronal size. similarly, we have found that decreasing wild-type htt levels in yac <dig> mice results in decreased neuronal size  <cit> . combined, these results suggest that wild-type htt levels influence neuronal size and suggest that loss of wild-type htt may contribute to the striatal neuronal atrophy observed in hd. an alternate possibility is that striatal neuronal size is more responsive to mildly beneficial effects of treatments as this measure has been shown to exhibit the most dramatic improvements in therapeutic trials in mouse models of hd  <cit> . the effect of wild-type htt on neuronal size may be related to htt's ability to increase bdnf transcription  <cit>  and transport  <cit>  since bdnf promotes the survival and differentiation of striatal neurons.

in contrast to the significant improvement in striatal neuronal size, there was no significant effect of wild-type htt over-expression on open field activity, striatal volume, striatal neuronal counts or striatal darpp- <dig> levels in yac <dig> mice, despite a trend towards improvement. in parallel with these experiments we examined the effect of eliminating wild-type htt expression in yac <dig> mice and found that there was a trend towards decreased striatal volume, striatal neuronal counts and striatal darpp- <dig> expression which did not reach significance  <cit>  . it is possible that the  <dig> month time point chosen to assess neuropathology in these experiments was too late in the disease process and that differences in severity were masked by a ceiling effect or that we have missed differences in the onset of striatal neuropathology.

in our previous study we observed a significant increase of both rotarod performance and survival when wild-type htt levels were increased in yac <dig> -/- mice to wild-type levels  <cit> . in this experiment, we did not observe any further improvement in either rotarod performance or survival with the over-expression of wild-type htt suggesting that there may be ceiling effect for the amount that wild-type htt can improve these outcome measures. while this study did not have enough power to demonstrate a significant improvement in survival, the fact that the percentage of mice surviving to  <dig> months was similar to yac <dig> mice suggests that the over-expression of wild-type huntingtin does not have a dramatic effect on survival in yac <dig> mice. the survival deficit in the yac <dig> and yac18/ <dig> mice were only observed in male mice thus confirming our previous observations  <cit> . unexpectedly, we found that increasing wild-type huntingtin expression in yac <dig> mice resulted in further decreases in testicular mass. combined with a trend towards decreased testicular mass in yac <dig> mice, this suggests the possibility that expression of htt beyond a certain threshold may result in testicular atrophy which is exacerbated by the presence of mutant htt. it is also possible that the human origin of the over-expressed htt contributes to the testicular phenotype. unfortunately, we are not aware of a mouse model that over-expresses wild-type mouse htt at high levels that would permit testing of this hypothesis.

in this study, we used the yac <dig> mouse model of hd which transgenically expresses mutant huntingtin at approximately 75% of endogenous levels  <cit> . these mice have two intact copies of the wild-type hd gene and we have previously shown that they express wild-type htt at the same level as wt mice  <cit> . as such, yac <dig> mice express higher levels of wild-type htt protein than patients with hd. the fact that the levels of wild-type htt are already increased in yac <dig> mice may diminish the therapeutic benefit we observe in yac18/ <dig> mice by further over-expressing wild-type htt. to more directly assess the therapeutic benefit of wild-type htt in hd, one could over-express mouse wild-type htt in a knockin mouse model of hd to assess the effect of wild-type htt on early disease phenotypes in these mice.

the results of this study are congruent with comparisons of homozygous and heterozygous hd patients and hd mouse models which suggest that mutant htt has a greater influence on the disease phenotype than wild-type htt. examination of disease severity in patients homozygous and heterozygous for mutations in the hd gene have reported either no difference or that homozygous hd patients are more severely affected  <cit> . two independent studies have also examined the phenotype of mice that are homozygous for a targeted expansion of the hd gene . in both cases, homozygous hd knock-in mice exhibited a more severe phenotype than heterozygous hd knock-in mice, but the differences were mild  <cit> . these studies suggest that mutant htt maintains many of the critical functions of wild-type htt as replacement of wild-type htt with mutant htt has only a mild effect on phenotype. however, it has been shown that polyglutamine expansion disrupts htt's neuroprotective function  <cit> , at least part of htt's role in transcription  <cit>  and transport  <cit> , and also affects the interaction of htt with its interaction partners  <cit> . since increasing mutant htt expression alone is known to result in a more severe phenotype in mice  <cit> , it suggests that the increase in phenotypic severity between heterozygous and homozygous patients and animal models is mainly caused by the increase in mutant htt levels which is in line with our findings that increasing levels of wild-type htt has only a small impact on the disease phenotype.

these findings are surprising given the importance of htt function and its demonstrated neuroprotective abilities. htt is essential for embryonic development and decreases in htt expression alone lead to abnormal phenotypes  <cit> . further, htt has been shown to protect cells from death both in vitro and in the testis and in the brain  <cit> . while htt has been shown to specifically protect against polyglutamine toxicity both in vitro  <cit>  and in the testis  <cit> , our findings here indicate a milder protective effect against mutant htt toxicity in the brain. given that wild-type htt exhibits protection against excitotoxic neurotoxins  <cit> , our finding that wild-type htt mildly improves striatal neuropathology in yac <dig> mice is not inconsistent with excitotoxicity contributing to the pathogenesis of hd.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results demonstrate that the over-expression of wild-type htt in yac <dig> mice results in a mild improvement in striatal neuropathology. based on the clear effect of htt over-expression on striatal neuronal size, it appears that htt function may be important in maintaining neuronal health. despite the protective function of wild-type htt, our results suggest that mutant htt toxicity is primarily responsible for the pathognomic striatal neuropathology in hd and that treatment of hd with wild-type htt may not be sufficient to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease.
