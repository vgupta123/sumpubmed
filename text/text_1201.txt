BACKGROUND
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  is an important emerging pathogen which can cause bloody diarrhoea , non-bloody diarrhoea  and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome . the ability of stec strains to cause severe disease in humans is related to their capacity to secrete shiga toxins, stx <dig> and stx <dig>  and variants of these toxins  <cit> . another virulence-associated factor of most stec isolates associated with severe disease is intimin, a 94-kda outer membrane protein, which is encoded by the eae gene on a ca. 34-kb chromosomal pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement . this locus is associated with the intimate adherence of e. coli to epithelial cells, initiation of host signal transduction pathways, and the formation of attaching-and-effacing intestinal lesions  <cit> . in addition, most stec strains associated with bd or hus produce an enterohaemolysin , encoded by a plasmid-borne gene, known as ehxa  <cit> .

argentina has a high incidence of hus:  <dig>  cases per  <dig>  children younger than  <dig> years old were reported in  <dig>  <cit> . this rate is 10-fold higher than in other industrialised countries  <cit> . in argentina stec is the primary aetiological agent of hus, and e. coli o157:h <dig> is the predominant serotype isolated  <cit> . in australia and new zealand the annual incidence of hus, determined through active surveillance, is approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  per  <dig>  children less than  <dig> years old  <cit> . interestingly, the predominant stec serotypes associated with hus in these two countries differs. whereas in new zealand o <dig> strains make up around half of the isolates, in australia serotype o <dig> stec account for most hus cases, with o <dig> associated with fewer than 20%  <cit> . the reasons for these differences are not known.

the aims of this study were to compare the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of stec o <dig> strains isolated from humans in argentina, australia and new zealand during the period 1993– <dig>  and to establish the genetic diversity and clonal relatedness among the strains isolated in these three countries. the rationale for undertaking this study was based upon national and international concerns that modern centralised and rapid food distribution systems in these countries together with recent increases in the volume of food trade internationally and the enormous increase in global travel could allow the unfettered, and undetected, worldwide spread of virulent clones of stec o <dig> 

RESULTS
of the  <dig> strains examined ,  <dig> were isolated from hus cases,  <dig> from bd cases, and  <dig> from nbd cases. the clinical origin of  <dig> strains was not specified . all strains were confirmed as e. coli o <dig>  were cytotoxic for vero cells, and carried the genes encoding intimin and flich <dig>  even though several were non-motile in vitro, and were typed as o157:h- . production of enterohaemolysin was observed in  <dig>  of  <dig> strains, in agreement with the polymerase chain reaction  results.

pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism  genotyping of the  <dig> o <dig> stec strains showed that  <dig>  strains harboured stx <dig> and stx2c ,  <dig>  carried only stx <dig>   <dig>  carried stx <dig> and stx <dig>   <dig>  carried stx <dig> and stx2c ,  <dig>  carried only stx2c ,  <dig>  carried only stx <dig> and  <dig>  carried stx <dig> and stx2-ut . the most frequent stx genotypes were stx <dig> and stx2c   in argentina, stx <dig> and stx <dig>  in australia, and stx <dig> in new zealand. stx <dig> was the only stx-genotype found in all  <dig> countries. no stx1-positive strains were obtained from patients in argentina or new zealand, compared with  <dig> of  <dig> from australia . of the  <dig> stx1-positive strains isolated in australia, however,  <dig> were also positive for stx <dig> or stx2c. notwithstanding these difference in toxin profile, there was no significant association between stx genotype and the clinical presentation of the patient from whom the strain was obtained .

the most frequent phage types  identified in argentina, australia, and new zealand were pt <dig> , pt <dig> , and pt <dig> , respectively . pt <dig> was the only pt found in all  <dig> countries with frequencies of 31%  in argentina; 15%  in australia, and 11%  in new zealand. there was no significant association between phage type and the clinical presentation of the patient from whom the strain was obtained .

pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  of xbai-digested genomic dna was used to subtype all  <dig> stec o <dig> strains, generating  <dig> distinct pfge patterns with 16– <dig> discernible fragments, ranging from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> kb in size. twenty-one patterns were identified amongst  <dig> strains isolated in argentina,  <dig> patterns in  <dig> strains from australia, and  <dig> patterns in  <dig> strains from new zealand.

ten clusters contained isolates with indistinguishable xbai-pfge profiles . these were cluster i ; cluster ii ; cluster iii ; cluster iv ; cluster v ; cluster vi ; cluster vii ; cluster viii ; cluster ix ; and cluster x . to refine the cluster analysis further, we determined the blni-pfge profile of each isolate. this revealed that most strains with identical xbai-pfge pattern could be discerned from each other by restriction with a second enzyme . some clusters could also be split by using phage typing and stx genotyping . only two clusters, ii  and x , both from australia, were indistinguishable by xbai- and blni-pfge, phage typing and stx-genotyping, indicating that these were probable clones.

in argentina, the predominant xbai-pfge patterns were arexhx01- <dig> , arexhx01- <dig> , arexhx01- <dig>  and arexhx01- <dig> . the eight strains in cluster vi were recovered from three hus cases and one bd case in  <dig>  and from two hus cases and two bd cases in  <dig>  all of these isolates carried stx <dig> and stx2c , except one strain isolated from a patient with hus which carried stx <dig> only. seven strains belonged to pt <dig>  and one to pt <dig>  four of the five strains in cluster iv carried stx <dig> and stx2c . four strains in this cluster were isolated from one case each of nbd, bd, and two of hus in  <dig>  three of these strains belonged to pt <dig>  and one to pt <dig>  the three stx2/stx2c  pt <dig> strains in this cluster showed the same pattern on blni-pfge and are likely to be a clone. the remaining strain in this cluster carried stx <dig>  belonged to pt <dig>  and was recovered from an hus case in  <dig>  the three strains in cluster i carried stx <dig> and stx2c  and were isolated from a bd case in  <dig>  and from a bd and a hus case in  <dig>  all three belonged to different pts . the two strains in cluster iii, carried stx <dig> and stx2c , belonged to pt <dig> and were isolated from a bd case in  <dig>  and an hus case in  <dig> 

in australia, the predominant xbai-pfge patterns were auexhx01- <dig> , and auexhx01- <dig> . all five strains in cluster x carried stx <dig> and stx <dig>  belonged to pt <dig>  and were isolated in  <dig> from one hus case, two contacts of this case and from two individuals with an unspecified disease other than hus or diarrhoea. these strains also showed the same blni-pfge pattern . all three strains in cluster ii carried stx <dig> and stx2c , belonged to pt <dig> and were isolated from hus cases in  <dig>  the strains were also indistinguishable by blni-pfge. the only enterohaemolysin-negative strain in this study carried stx <dig> alone, belonged to pt <dig> and was isolated from a hus case in  <dig> 

in new zealand, the predominant xbai-pfge patterns were nzexhx01- <dig> , nzexhx01- <dig> , nzexhx01- <dig> , and nzexhx01- <dig> . the four strains in cluster viii were isolated from bd cases in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and from a hus case in  <dig>  the three strains in cluster ix were obtained from two hus cases in  <dig> and one case of bd in  <dig>  the two strains in cluster v were isolated from bd cases in  <dig>  and the two strains in cluster vii were isolated from an hus case in  <dig> and a nbd case in  <dig>  all  <dig> strains harboured stx <dig> and were the same phage type .

discussion
this study revealed differences in the stx genotype, phage type and pfge profiles of clinically-significant stec o <dig> strains isolated from humans in argentina, australia and new zealand. strains that possessed both stx <dig> and stx <dig> were relatively more prevalent in australia as is the case in the usa  <cit> , japan  <cit>  and chile  <cit> , amongst others. on the other hand, the relatively high prevalence of stx2-positive strains in new zealand resembles the toxin profile of stec o <dig> in western europe  <cit> . in argentina, all isolates were either stx <dig> or and stx2/stx2c , with stx2/stx2c  strains accounting for more than 90% of isolates. this highly virulent genotype has been described by nishikawa et al.  <cit>  as being associated with severe human disease. the high frequency of this toxin profile in isolates from argentina, and that of stx2-producing stec in new zealand, which are also reportedly more virulent than other strains  <cit> , compared with australia , may account in part for the relatively low frequency of severe infection with stec o <dig> in australia compared with the other countries. our finding that stx profile was not significantly associated with clinical presentation, may have been due to a sampling error, in that isolates from the sickest patients are more likely to be sent to reference laboratories for characterisation.

at least  <dig> phage types have been reported for stec o <dig>  <cit> , but only four of these  accounted for 84% of the strains analysed in this study. in europe and canada, pt <dig>  pt <dig>  pt <dig>  pt <dig>  pt <dig>  pt <dig>  and pt <dig> account for the majority  of stec o <dig> strains obtained from humans  <cit> . six of these pts , were identified in the present study, but only pt <dig> occurred in all three countries. pt <dig> and pt <dig> predominate among human strains of stec o <dig> in spain, belgium, finland, germany, italy, england and scotland  <cit> . in our study, pt <dig> was predominant in new zealand strains, and also was identified among the argentinian strains, but not in australian strains. pt <dig> was not identified in this study. pt <dig>  predominant in canada  <cit> , was identified in argentinian and australian strains, but not in those from new zealand. pt <dig> and pt <dig> were common in argentina, but absent  or infrequent  in australia and new zealand.

pfge is the ''gold standard'' of genetic fingerprinting methods for e. coli o <dig> and is particularly useful for tracking outbreak strains  <cit> . in this study a high degree of diversity was observed among the strains analysed by this technique. no common xbai-pfge pattern was found in strains isolated in argentina, australia or new zealand. however, different clusters were detected in each country. the predominant xbai-pfge patterns were: arexhx01- <dig>  in argentina, auexhx01- <dig>  in australia and nzexhx01- <dig>  in new zealand. the exhx01- <dig> and exhx01- <dig> patterns that were frequent in this study are common within the argentinian database, comprising 30% of the stec o <dig> isolates detected in different regions of argentina during the last  <dig> years  <cit> . arexhx01- <dig> is indistinguishable from exhx01- <dig>  the second most common pattern in the us national database, accounting for approximately  <dig> % of strains. the most recent multi-state outbreak with a strain of this pattern occurred in  <dig> and was linked to beef, resulting in a food recall  <cit> .

all but two of the xbai-pfge clusters could be subdivided by one or more of stx genotyping, phage typing and blni-pfge . those which could not be subdivided in this way included three strains that were epidemiologically related, and others that may have been responsible for small, undetected community outbreaks of infection. in the absence of pertinent data about the patients from whom these strains were obtained, however, we were unable to test this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig> stec o <dig> strains isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> from symptomatic humans in argentina, australia and new zealand differed in terms of stx-genotype and phage type. no common xbai-pfge pattern was found in the strains isolated in the three countries, indicating that there up until  <dig> there was little spread of stec o <dig> between them. most isolates with common xbai-pfge patterns could be distinguished form each other by stx genotyping, phage typing or blni-pfge. by conducting international collaborative studies, using standardised detection and typing tools of the type reported here, reference laboratories will be able to detect the emergence of potentially hypervirulent stec clones and monitor their spread.
