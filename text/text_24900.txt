BACKGROUND
calluna vulgaris  is an important ornamental crop for autumn planting in northern europe. the demand for c. vulgaris has constantly been increasing during the last years because of the longevity of a special mutant in flower morphology, the so-called bud bloomers. today, 80% of all protected varieties of c. vulgaris in germany are bud bloomers  <cit>  and make c. vulgaris one of the top selling landscaping plants in germany  <cit> . the bud bloomers show an unique flower architecture with combination of unopened flowers and absence of any organ development in whorl iii: the perianth of bud bloomers remains closed during the whole flowering period, stamens are missing and petals are converted into sepals  <cit> . bud blooming individuals were found in natural populations in  <dig> and  <dig> in great britain as well as in  <dig> in the netherlands  <cit>  and were introduced as commercial varieties. due to the shielding from cross-pollination by closed perianth organs and the impossibility of self-pollination due to the loss of stamens and the presence of a second whorl of robust sepals instead of softer petals, the flower buds of bud bloomers display a prolonged flower attractiveness compared to other flower types of c. vulgaris. the extended longevity of flowers is a highly desired trait promoting the bud bloomers’ economic success compared to varieties with wild type or filled flowers. an attractive flower morphology is one of the major selection targets in ornamental breeding.

within the bud bloomers two different types are found: the diplocalyx type and polystyla type  <cit>  . the diplocalyx type is by far dominating the market. the inheritance of the bud flowering diplocalyx type was found to be monogenic-recessive  <cit> . it is characterized by a closed perianth during the whole flowering period, stamens are completely missing and petals are converted to sepals. hence, in the diplocalyx bud bloomer type, the two whorls of sepals are directly following the gynoecium. in floral development of this flower type, stamen primordia are detectable but stamens are not formed at all  <cit> . the floral formula of this type is ca4+4co0a0g   <cit> , whereas the flower formula of the mature wild type  is ca4coa8g  <cit> . in the polystyla bud blooming flower type the perianth remains closed and petals are converted to sepals as in the diplocalyx type, but organs in floral whorl iii are formed and show carpel character . the according floral formula is ca4+4co0g8g.figure  <dig>

the genetics of different flower architectures can be explained by the abc model of floral organ identity and its variants. it describes the interaction of the homeotic transcription factors in determination of floral organ identity  <cit> . in the classical abc model, the expression of a genes is responsible for development of sepals in whorl i, activity of b genes in combination with c genes is necessary to determine organ identity of stamens in whorl iii. b gene together with a gene function induces the formation of petals in whorl ii. finally, c gene expression on its own defines carpels. since b genes in combination with a und c are responsible for the determination of organs in whorl ii and iii, and these organs are affected in both bud bloomer mutants, a deficiency in b gene function is the most convincing hypothesis for formation of the bud flowering phenotype in c. vulgaris. accordingly, the polystyla bud blooming type corresponds perfectly to the phenotype of a classical b gene mutant as described in arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> , antirrhinum majus   <cit> , and several other plant species  <cit> . the closed perianth in bud bloomers is probably the result of petal loss, as studies in arabidopsis b gene mutants show  <cit> .

in first gene expression analyses, borchert et al.   <cit>  already found a reduced expression of the b gene cvap <dig> in floral organs of whorl ii in three diplocalyx bud flowering cultivars indicating the presence of a second whorl of sepals instead of petals which is expected according to the model. on the other hand, the formation of petaloid sepals in all flower types of c. vulgaris points to an ectopic expression of b genes in whorl i, resulting in conflicting hypotheses with regard to the genetics of the diplocalyx bud flower type.

therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare the transcriptome of the wild type  and the diplocalyx bud bloomer flowers  of c. vulgaris and to deduce a hypothesis for the genetic basis of the diplocalyx bud bloomer flower architecture.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing and assembly
for transcriptome comparison, the bud blooming cultivar ‘maria’  and its wild type flowering descendent f <dig> , resulting from a cross between ‘maria’ and ‘boskoop’ , have been selected in order to keep the genetic difference not depending on the flower type as low as possible. two cdna libraries were constructed from mrna of young flower buds of both genotypes. flowers included bracts, sepals, petals, stamens , and carpels. the generated cdna had a size of approximately 500– <dig> base pairs . libraries were tagged, combined and sequenced using the  <dig> sequencing technique . a summary of sequencing and assembly results is given in table  <dig>  overall, a total of  <dig>  reads were generated with a total yield of ~  <dig> million nucleotides . the average read length was 307 nt. sequences shorter than 50 nt were not used in the assembly. the assembly of all reads resulted in  <dig>  contigs . contig length was gaussian distributed with a clear maximum around 500 nt . the separate assembly of the bud bloomer library resulted in  <dig>  contigs, whereas the wild type library yielded  <dig>  contigs after read assembly . singletons were excluded from further analysis since singletons are single reads without any significant overlaps with any other read. therefore, it was considered as dubious to conclude differential gene expression from a single read.  <dig>  common contigs were found in the wt library and the bud library.table  <dig>

annotation of sequences
for annotation, contig sequences were compared to known sequences in publicly available databases. blast2go  <cit>  was used for blasting, mapping, and annotating the contigs by comparing the assembled sequences to the non-redundant protein  data base of the national centre for biotechnology information  . from the assembly of all reads ,  <dig> % of the contigs shared significant homology with known proteins.  <dig> % of the contigs from the bud library and  <dig> % of the contigs from the wt library, respectively, showed significant homology to proteins from the database. in all assemblies, around  <dig> % of the contigs displayed homology to unknown/hypothetical proteins. most blast hits were obtained from vitis vinifera , followed by glycine max , populus trichocarpa , arabidopsis thaliana , and cucumis sativus . vitis vinifera is the closest phylogenetic relative of c. vulgaris with a completely sequenced genome available. the amount of blast hits is correlated to the amount of available sequence information. therefore, closer relatives of c. vulgaris like camellia sinensis , actinidia chinensis , or actinidia deliciosa  delivered blast top-hits , but were outnumbered by fully sequenced organisms.table  <dig>

differential gene expression
the primary goal of the transcriptome study was to identify differentially expressed genes in both flower types and to obtain sequence information of c. vulgaris for later identification and validation of possible candidate genes. flower type specific read numbers per contig were obtained by mapping the flower type library reads to the backbone assembly. subsequently the transcript abundances in both libraries were compared. to discover genes uniquely or preferentially expressed in one of the flower type specific libraries, audic claverie statistics  <cit>  via the web tool ideg <dig>  <cit>  was used.  <dig> contigs were found to be statistically significant differentially expressed comparing the bud flowering and the wild type phenotype .  <dig> contigs were found to be preferentially expressed in the bud bloomer and  <dig> of these were found exclusively in the bud flowering phenotype. in the wild type,  <dig> contigs were preferentially expressed and  <dig> were found to be present only in this flower type. sequences with significant similarities to annotated proteins in ncbi were assigned to the gene ontology  categories biological process, molecular function, and cellular component . homologues proteins involved in biological processes were attributed to metabolic processes, cellular processes, responses to stimulus, biological regulations, and cellular components organisation or biogenesis. regarding the molecular functions, catalytic activities and binding properties were the most abundant go categories followed by transporter activities, structural molecular activities, and electron carrier activities. with respect to the cellular components, homologues proteins were mostly associated to organelles, membranes and macromolecule complexes. for more detailed analysis, a go enrichment analysis by fischer’s exact test was performed and revealed for differentially expressed genes in the wt data set an overrepresentation of the go terms translation, ribosomal subunit, ribonucleoprotein complex, ribosome cytosolic part, cytosolic ribosome, cytosol, structural constituent of ribosome, structural molecule activity, cellular biosynthetic process, and cellular protein metabolic process .figure  <dig>

functional classification of differentially expressed genes
 <dig> differentially expressed genes  did not match homologues proteins in the data base. differentially expressed genes that could be annotated were checked for functional classification in biological processes to identify reasonable candidates for the bud flowering phenotype. go enrichment analysis pointed out to overrepresentation of go terms related to ribosome function in wt. in addition, the data sets of differentially expressed genes in the go categories “flower development”, “floral whorls development” and “sequence specific dna binding transcription factor activity” were carefully checked for probable candidate genes . the following annotated contigs were assigned to flower or floral whorl development: dnaj, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, 26s proteasome non atpase regulatory subunit rpu 12a, basic blue protein, 3-ketoacyl-synthase  <dig>  none of these was considered as potential candidate gene for the bud flowering phenotype. in addition, the blast and mapping results of four differentially expressed transcription factors were monitored. two putative transcription factors, a gaga binding transcriptional activator and an ethylene responsive transcription factor rap2- <dig>  are considered to be involved in stress response. a putative e2fe like transcription factor is involved in cell proliferation. consequently, these three genes were also excluded as candidate genes. the fourth one, contig <dig> which exerts a homology to pistillata , belonging to the class b genes, of actinidia chinensis , was identified as a promising candidate gene and was named cvpi.

the genes differentially expressed in the different flower type of c. vulgaris were also compared to a list of differentially expressed genes in arabidopsis b gene mutants from microarray studies  <cit> .  <dig> of the contigs from c. vulgaris could be assigned to counterparts in the arabidopsis data set, at least on protein family level. most matches  were obtained with the pi- <dig> mutant.  <dig> matches were found with ap3- <dig> mutant and  <dig> with the ap3- <dig> mutant.  <dig> c. vulgaris contigs showed a similar expression pattern as the corresponding genes in arabidopsis in at least at one of three time points monitored in the arabidopsis study .

evaluation of candidate gene by real-time pcr 
for subsequent validation of cvpi function in c. vulgaris flower organ formation, a quantitative pcr analysis was performed in wild type and three bud blooming genotypes. although transcriptome data gave no hint on differential expression in the bud and wt libraries for the second identified b gene from c. vulgaris, cvap <dig>  <cit>  was also included in the study, as borchert et al.  <dig>  <cit>  found deviating expressions patterns of cvap <dig> in floral tissues of diplocalyx c. vulgaris bud bloomers and wild type cultivars. five reference genes were chosen from the library. the reference genes with most stable expression in flower tissue were: cvtata binding, cv18s rrna, cvactin, cvtsa, and cvdisease resistance protein. to compare flower type specific expression of cvpi and cvap <dig> ΔΔct values were calculated with f <dig>  as reference and converted to fold change ratios of arbitrary units. exemplarily for the three different cultivars per flower type, the results of the cultivars ‘maria’  compared to the genotype f <dig>  and ‘boskoop’  compared to genotype f <dig>  are presented . these genotypes were chosen, because the cdna libraries for transcriptome sequencing were generated from ‘maria’  and f <dig> . cvpi expression in both phenotypes was no accurately detectable in leaves, bracts and sepals, whereas cvap <dig> expression was found in all studied organs. hence, differential gene expression data of cvap <dig> for all floral whorls are presented in figure  <dig>  whereas corresponding data of the sepals  for cvpi in figure  <dig> are missing. cvpi showed the expression pattern expected from the abc model with the highest expression level in whorls iii and ii of wild type flowers, thus confirming the results of the transcriptome analysis, since the expression of cvpi was reduced in floral organs of bud bloomer ‘maria’. although the expression level of cvpi was found to be genotype dependent, a clear organ specific expression pattern was identified in all genotypes. reliable expression data of cvpi were obtained from wt flowers in whorl iv, whorl iii, and whorl ii organs; in bud bloomers in whorl iv and whorl ii. in wt flowers of f <dig> and ‘boskoop’ , cvpi expression was most abundant in whorl iii followed by whorl ii and whorl iv. compared to the expression of cvpi in wt flowers in whorl ii, its expression in the diplocalyx bud bloomer was reduced by factor  <dig> . likewise, in the transcriptome analysis  <dig> sequences reads of cvpi were obtained from the wt library  and none in the bud bloomer’s library . this reduction of cvpi expression was not observed comparing f <dig> and ‘boskoop’ . in contrast, the expression of cvap <dig> was clearly detectable throughout all floral organs in both flower types . fold-change ratios comparing expression of cvap <dig> in the different flower types were generally smaller than the corresponding values for cvpi. as expression of cvap <dig> on whole flower level did not clearly differ between the flower types, no differential expression was detected in the transcriptome approach. in the organ-specific qrt pcr analysis, the bud bloomer showed a lack of cvap <dig> expression in whorl ii compared to the wt f <dig>  so both, cvap <dig> and cvpi expression are reduced in whorl ii of bud bloomers. the comparison of the male parent ‘boskoop’ and its offspring f <dig> indicates a lower abundance of cvap <dig> expression in organs of whorl i-iii but a higher expression in whorl iv. in ‘maria’, the bud blooming parent of f <dig>  cvap <dig> expression compared to its wt offspring was higher in whorl i and iv but reduced in whorl ii and not detected in whorl iii, since the organs are absent. the overall highest fold-change ratio for differential expression of cvap <dig> was factor  <dig>  detected in stamens of different wild type genotypes, indicating that the detected fold-change ratios of cvap <dig> cannot be clearly attributed to differences of the flower types or genotypic differences independent of the flower type. expression of cvap <dig> in whorl i seems to be common for c. vulgaris, since wild type and bud bloomer exhibit cvap <dig> transcript levels in a comparable abundance in whorl i . the reduction of cvap <dig> expression in whorl ii of bud bloomers confirms earlier findings demonstrating that bud bloomer organs in whorl i and ii are sepals  <cit>  instead of sepals and petals in the wild type. in both flower types, expression of cvap <dig> is deviating from the classical abc model showing ectopic b gene expression in whorl i.figure  <dig>

discussion
in c. vulgaris bud bloomers of the diplocalyx type male flower organs are missing , petals are converted into a second whorl of sepals and the flower remains closed. this flower type is a highly desired trait in ornamental plant breeding, since the bud bloomers’ flowers have an extended flowering period. the aims of this study were to characterise the gene expression profile of c. vulgaris diplocalyx bud bloomers by a broad transcriptome study and deduce candidate genes causing the diplocalyx bud flowering phenotype by the comparison with wt flowers.

unopened flowers which later drop and form no siliques have been described in arabidopsis lsu <dig> mutants  <cit> . in addition, flowers of pi- <dig> mutants as well as transgenic arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing lmads <dig> or lmads <dig> flowers were termed as unopened  <cit> . the morphology of these mutants points to a crosslink of floral organ morphology and flower opening  <cit> . this circumstance is a good explanation for the bud bloomers’ phenotype in c. vulgaris. since stamen development was not detectable in the diplocalyx type  <cit>  or stamens have carpel-like character in the polystyla type and petals are replaced by sepals, organs responsible for flower opening are missing in these flower types. the identity of the affected organs points to a modified expression of a b gene in the bud flowering phenotype, since stamens and petals are the mutated organs. the apparent absence of third whorl organs may reflect their complete incorporation into the fourth whorl gynoecium  <cit> . upstream regulators of b gene expression as ufo, leafy or ap <dig> are unlikely to be affected in the c. vulgaris bud bloomer mutants, because dysfunctions in these genes would cause severe flower malformations: ufo mutants in arabidopsis display filamentous structures instead of flowers  <cit> . leafy mutants produce leafs and associated lateral shoots instead of early flowers, later developing flowers are substituted by structures with flower and leaf traits  <cit> . in ap <dig> mutants of arabidopsis, sepals are replaced by bracts, petals are missing and additional flowers arise in the axils of the first whorl organs  <cit> .

however, in model plants, typical b gene loss of function mutants display a second whorl of sepals instead of petals and the formation of carpeloid stamens. in arabidopsis, the b genes apetala <dig>  and pistillata  are responsible for the control of organ identity in whorl ii  and iii   <cit> . since ap <dig> and pi function as a heterodimer in arabidopsis, mutations of either ap <dig> or pi cause identical phenotypes with altered organ identity in whorl ii and whorl iii  <cit> . the function of the b class genes ap <dig> and pi seems to be highly conserved during evolution of flowering plants. because c. vulgaris bud bloomers phenotype shows conflicting characters compared to a classical b gene mutant - on the one hand petaliod sepals, on the other hand loss of stamens and petals - a broad rna sequencing approach was chosen to find genes differentially expressed in wt and the diplocalyx bud flowering phenotypes of c. vulgaris. these data have been compared to the data set of wuest et al.  <dig>  <cit>  to elucidate parallels and differences with arabidopsis b gene mutants.

high throughput  <dig> sequencing was found to be an effective method to characterise the transcriptomes of different flower types of c. vulgaris. next generation sequencing is the state of the art approach for broad gene expression analysis relative to methods such as microarrays and subtractive cdna libraries  <cit> . the  <dig> sequencing technology is an effective tool for tissue specific functional genomics in non-sequenced plants species, because it is capable to capture also rarely expressed transcripts as transcription factors  <cit>  and delivers massive numbers of additional transcript sequences which were useful in the presented study for qrt pcr normalizer choice. in addition, the obtained data bases of c. vulgaris floral transcriptomes are valuable resources for further research on flower related traits in this ornamental crop.

from the set of  <dig> differentially expressed genes, cvpi was considered to be the most plausible candidate responsible for causing the diplocalyx flower mutant. moreover, a significantly reduced expression level of cvpi in diplocalyx bud bloomers has been confirmed by qrt-pcr. nevertheless, the lack of cvpi expression in c. vulgaris bud bloomers is not causing the typical phenotype of a b gene mutant as anticipated from arabidopsis, since in diploxcalys flower mutants, stamens are completely missing. a similar phenotype has been found in a peloric mutant of phalaenopsis equestris in which the development of stamens and staminodes was completely eliminated  <cit>  and the expression of the b gene pemads <dig> was not detectable in the floral tissue.

in c. vulgaris, the expression of cvpi was found to be high in petals and stamens of the wild type as expected from the abc model. in contrast, cvap <dig> expression was prominent in whorl i-iii of wt and diplocalyx bud blooming flowers. in opposite to cvap <dig>  hardly any cvpi transcript was detectable in the floral tissues of the bud flowering plants by qrt pcr. according to the classical abc model and its modifications, the expression of the ap3-like gene is restricted to whorls ii and iii  <cit> . cvap <dig> expression in whorl i is considered to cause the petaloid character of c. vulgaris sepals in both studied flower types. this finding is supported by earlier expression analysis in c. vulgaris  <cit>  and data from multiple species, including important floriculture crops as tulipa gesneriana   <cit> , lilium longiflorum   <cit> , and agapanthus praecox   <cit> . since cvpi expression is absent from floral tissue of diplocalyx bud bloomers, it is assumed that petal and stamen development in c. vulgaris depends on the binding of cvpi in a regulatory complex of mads box genes containing cvap <dig> and the absence of cvpi is causing to the development of a second whorl of petaloid sepals and the absence of stamens. due to the petaloid character of this extra whorl of sepals and the expression level of cvap <dig> in whorls ii and iii, it is concluded that only the lack of cvpi expression is causing the altered flower architecture and not a combined dysfunction of cvpi and cvap <dig>  in addition, the finding of cvap <dig> transcripts in carpels of diplocalyx bud bloomers without stamen character also points to the hypothesis of an exclusive dysfunction of cvpi being responsible for the loss of stamens.

to elucidate the consequences of putative cvpi dysfunction in c. vulgaris the list of differentially expressed genes in young flowers of c. vulgaris comparing the diplocalyx bud bloomer and wild type flowers was compared to published data from arabidopsis b gene mutants  <cit> . in this study  <dig> genes were identified to be differentially regulated in b gene mutants. in arabidopsis pi1- <dig> mutants, go terms like petal development, stamen development, floral organ formation, floral organ morphogenesis, and regulation transcription were found to be significantly enriched. in contrast, these go terms were not enriched in the c. vulgaris data set. the major difficulty in functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in c. vulgaris bud bloomers proved to be the low informative value of go term enrichment analysis. the annotation of c. vulgaris sequences did not identify single genes but gene families or only protein motives, making obtained go terms rather unspecific. this is attributed to the low sequence identity between c. vulgaris and model plants and to the incomplete annotation of sequence data from closer relatives. therefore, for more detailed results using go analysis of the present  <dig> read data, more detailed sequence information of c. vulgaris or close relatives is needed.

further studies on the bud bloomers phenotype in c. vulgaris are planned including comparison of b gene expression in the diplocalyx and polystyla type and the localisation of transcripts with an in situ hybridisation approach to unveil cvpi and cvap <dig> expression pattern during floral development. protein and dna binding studies with cvpi and cvap <dig> protein from bud bloomer and wild type genotypes are necessary to clarify the composition and function of homeotic floral mads box protein complexes in c. vulgaris flower development. of special interest in c. vulgaris is the investigation of the crosslink of b gene expression and the genetic regulation of carpel development reported from arabidopsis  <cit> , since several cultivars with bud flowering phenotype suffer from carpel malformation  <cit> . moreover, mapping of cvpi expression in an existing mapping population  <cit>  is planned to check the cosegregation with the trait flower type.

CONCLUSIONS
the b genes cvpi und cvap <dig> have been found to play crucial roles in the development to the diplocalyx bud bloomer mutants of c. vulgaris, which are of major economic significance in this important landscaping plant. ectopic expression of cvap <dig> in sepals seems to be responsible for their petaloid character. a drastically reduced expression of cvpi in flowers of diplocalyx bud bloomer mutants points to a central role of this transcription factor in the formation of this flower type. further research is necessary to figure out the differences in b gene expression between polystyla and diplocalyx bud bloomers in c. vulgaris.
