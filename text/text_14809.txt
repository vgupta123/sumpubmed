BACKGROUND
peroxisomes house important metabolic reactions including β-oxidation. oilseed plants, like arabidopsis thaliana, β-oxidize fatty acids to provide energy for early seedling development before photosynthesis is established  <cit> . because this β-oxidation is peroxisomal, dependence on an external source of fixed carbon, such as sucrose, during germination is a hallmark of peroxisome-defective mutants  <cit> .

peroxisomes can derive from the endoplasmic reticulum and proliferate by division  <cit> . morphology and numbers of peroxisomes can vary depending on the cell type, developmental stage, or environmental conditions  <cit> . peroxins  function in peroxisome biogenesis and/or matrix protein import  <cit> . fully folded or oligomerized proteins can be post-translationally imported into the peroxisomal matrix by the peroxisomal import machinery  <cit> . pex <dig> recognizes and delivers proteins carrying peroxisome targeting signal type  <dig> , often a c-terminal tripeptide   <cit> . the receptor-cargo complexes translocate cargo with the assistance of docking peroxins ; this importomer forms transient pores on the peroxisomal membrane to deliver cargo into the peroxisome matrix  <cit> .

after cargo delivery, pex <dig> is recycled from the membrane back to the cytosol with the assistance of a peroxisome-tethered ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme   <cit>  and ring-finger peroxins   <cit> . in yeast, pex <dig> and pex <dig> monoubiquitinate pex <dig> for recycling and further rounds of cargo delivery whereas ubc <dig> and pex <dig> polyubiquitinate pex <dig>  which targets pex <dig> for proteasomal degradation  <cit> . ubiquitinated pex <dig> is recognized and removed from the peroxisomal membrane by a complex of the pex <dig> and pex <dig> atpases  and pex <dig>  which recruits the pex1-pex <dig> heterohexamer to the peroxisome .

although caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster direct essentially all matrix proteins to peroxisomes via the pex5-pts <dig> system , peroxisomes in various yeasts, plants, and mammals also can import proteins bearing n-terminal pts <dig> nonapeptides . pts <dig> proteins are recognized and imported by pex <dig>  <cit> . pex <dig> and pex <dig> are interdependent in plants  <cit>  and mutually enhance cargo-receptor interactions in mammals  <cit> . in plants, the protease deg <dig> cleaves the n-terminal pts <dig> region after delivery to the peroxisome matrix  <cit> . in mammals, damaged pex <dig> can be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome  <cit> , but the mechanism by which undamaged pex <dig> is recycled remains unclear.

ubiquitin modification can target pex <dig> for recycling or degradation  <cit> . moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that balancing pex <dig> targeting and retrotranslocation is important for normal peroxisome function  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrate that elevated growth temperature reduces pex <dig> levels in mutants defective in pex <dig> recycling. we implicate proteasomal degradation rather than autophagy in this decrease. we hypothesize that reducing overall pex <dig> levels relieves the detrimental effects of membrane-associated pex <dig> in pex4- <dig> and ameliorates the associated physiological defects.

RESULTS
growth at elevated temperature ameliorates the peroxisomal defects of pex4-1
peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation provides fixed carbon and energy to germinating arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> . peroxisomal mutants that inefficiently perform β-oxidation fail to germinate or grow less vigorously  <cit> . these defects can be partially reversed by supplementing the growth medium with a fixed carbon source, such as sucrose, which bypasses the need for β-oxidation. as a result, peroxisomal mutants have shorter hypocotyls or do not germinate without sucrose when grown at normal temperature  .

to examine the effect of temperature on mutants with impaired peroxisome function, we surveyed peroxisome-defective mutants for sucrose dependence at normal  and elevated  growth temperatures. we tested mutants defective in matrix protein receptors   <cit> , receptor docking   <cit> , and receptor recycling   <cit> . growth at 28 °c increased dark-grown hypocotyl lengths  but did not markedly alter sucrose dependence in wild type or most peroxisome-defective mutants tested . interestingly, we found that high temperature ameliorated the sucrose dependence of dark-grown pex4- <dig> seedlings . at 22 °c, pex4- <dig> hypocotyls were shorter without sucrose supplementation; however, at 28 °c, pex4- <dig> hypocotyls were similarly long with or without sucrose . this restoration of sucrose independence by growth at high temperature was specific to pex4-1; the sucrose dependence of pex5- <dig>  pex7- <dig>  pex14- <dig>  pex2- <dig> and pex10- <dig> was unchanged or very slightly exacerbated at high temperature, and pex13- <dig> did not germinate without sucrose at either temperature . we therefore focused on the pex4- <dig> mutant to elucidate the molecular changes in peroxisome function that accompany growth at high temperature.fig.  <dig> high temperature ameliorates physiological defects and reduces pex <dig> levels of pex4- <dig>  physiological consequences of growth temperature on pex mutants. seedlings were grown in the dark at  <dig> or 28 °c with or without  <dig>  % sucrose , or on media containing  <dig>  % sucrose with or without 30 μm iba ,  <dig>  μm iaa , 2 μm  <dig> -db , or  <dig> nm  <dig> -d . dark-grown hypocotyl lengths were normalized to the corresponding mean of  <dig>  % sucrose treatment. means of normalized dark-grown hypocotyl lengths and standard deviations of the means are shown . b protein extracts of dark-grown seedlings from  <dig>  % sucrose-supplemented plant nutrient media in panel  were processed for immunoblotting. the membrane was serially probed with indicated antibodies. hsc <dig> was used to monitor protein loading. the positions of molecular mass markers  are indicated on the left. band intensities were quantified using imagej; levels of pex <dig> or pex <dig> were normalized to the corresponding hsc <dig> band prior to normalizing to the 22 °c wild-type band to give the listed numbers



in addition to fatty acids, indole-3-butyric acid  is β-oxidized in peroxisomes to indole-3-acetic acid , which inhibits cell elongation  <cit> . similarly, the synthetic auxin precursor  <dig> -dichlorophenoxybutyric acid  is β-oxidized in peroxisomes to  <dig> -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid   <cit> . consequently, wild-type hypocotyls are short following growth on iba or  <dig> -db whereas peroxisomal mutants often have longer hypocotyls  <cit>  . like sucrose dependence , we found that growth at high temperature partially restored iba  and  <dig> -db  responsiveness to the pex4- <dig> mutant. to determine whether this restored iba responsiveness stemmed from improved peroxisome function or generally increased responsiveness to auxin, we tested the response of pex4- <dig> to iaa and  <dig> -d, which do not require peroxisomal chain shortening for biological activity. we found that pex4- <dig> responded like wild type to both iaa  and  <dig> -d  at both normal and elevated growth temperatures. we concluded that growth at elevated temperature improves peroxisome-related physiology in the pex4- <dig> mutant.

the arabidopsis pex4- <dig> mutation alters a conserved proline residue and impairs pex <dig> function  <cit> , but the impact of this mutation on pex <dig> levels has not been reported. we developed an antibody to arabidopsis pex <dig>  and examined pex <dig> levels in our various mutants following growth at normal or elevated temperatures. we detected pex <dig> in all of the mutants grown at 22 °c and found pex <dig> levels were generally reduced following growth at high temperature . in the pex4- <dig> mutant grown at 22 °c, pex4- <dig> protein levels were reduced compared to wild type , suggesting that the pro123leu mutation destabilizes the pex4- <dig> protein. pex4- <dig> levels were further reduced in pex4- <dig> grown at 28 °c , indicating that high temperature did not ameliorate pex4- <dig> physiological defects by restoring pex4- <dig> protein levels back to wild-type pex <dig> levels.

in yeast, the pex <dig> pts <dig> receptor is retrotranslocated from the peroxisomal membrane by the pex1-pex <dig> atpase complex following ubiquitination by the pex2-pex10-pex <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase complex assisted by the pex <dig> ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mutation of these receptor-recycling peroxins can result in pex <dig> destabilization, as in the pex6- <dig> mutant  <cit> , or in excessive pex <dig> membrane association suggestive of inefficient retrotranslocation, as in the pex4- <dig> mutant  <cit>  and a pex <dig> mutant  <cit> . moreover, arabidopsis pex <dig> mutants display reduced pex <dig> levels accompanied by pts <dig> import defects in light-grown but not dark-grown seedlings  <cit> . we used immunoblotting to examine pex <dig> levels in our panel of mutants and found that all of the dark-grown mutants except pex6- <dig> accumulated detectable levels of pex <dig> when grown at 22 °c. however, pex <dig> levels were clearly reduced following growth in the dark at high temperature in several mutants , especially in pex7- <dig> and in the receptor-recycling mutants . we confirmed that pex <dig> is needed to maintain pex <dig> levels at elevated growth temperature by using an intronic pex <dig> mutant . although pex4- <dig> did not display obvious physiological defects , we found similar high temperature-induced pex <dig> reduction in both pex4- <dig> and pex4- <dig> .fig.  <dig> overexpressing pex <dig> but not pex <dig> worsens the peroxisomal defects of pex4- <dig> 
a, b seedlings were grown as in the legend of fig.  <dig>  means of normalized dark-grown hypocotyl lengths and standard deviations of the means are shown . pex <dig> was overexpressed in wild type and pex4- <dig> using the 35s:pex <dig> construct  <cit> . pex <dig> was overexpressed in wild type using the 35s:pex7a construct  <cit>  and in pex4- <dig> using the 35s:pex <dig> construct  <cit> . c protein extracts of dark-grown seedlings from  <dig>  % sucrose-supplemented plant nutrient media were processed for immunoblotting. the membrane was serially probed with the indicated antibodies. thiolase is synthesized as a pts2-containing precursor  and cleaved in the peroxisome into a mature  form. hsc <dig> was used to monitor protein loading. the positions of molecular mass markers  are indicated on the left. band intensities were quantified using imagej; levels of pex <dig> were normalized to the corresponding hsc <dig> band prior to normalizing to the 22 °c wild-type band to give the listed numbers



overexpressing pex <dig> exacerbates the peroxisomal defects of pex4-1
because pex <dig> is inefficiently retrotranslocated from the peroxisomal membrane in pex4- <dig>  <cit> , and because both sucrose dependence and pex <dig> levels were reduced in pex4- <dig> following growth at elevated temperature , we tested whether overexpressing pex <dig> using the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter might exacerbate pex4- <dig> defects. whereas overexpressing pex <dig> in wild type did not confer iba resistance or sucrose dependence in dark-grown seedlings , we found that overexpressing pex <dig> increased the iba resistance  and heightened the thiolase pts <dig> processing defect  of dark-grown pex4- <dig> seedlings, again suggesting a key role for pex <dig> levels or localization in pex4- <dig> physiological defects. growth at elevated temperature only partially ameliorated the increased iba resistance and pts <dig> processing defects of pex4- <dig> 35s:pex <dig>  and failed to rescue the sucrose dependence of pex4- <dig> 35s:pex <dig> . in contrast, overexpressing pex <dig>  the pts <dig> matrix protein receptor, did not worsen pex4- <dig> defects but rather appeared to rescue the mild thiolase pts2-processing defect of pex4- <dig> at 22 °c . overexpression of either pex <dig> or pex <dig> did not markedly alter levels of pex <dig> or peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase , two peroxisomal membrane proteins .

to determine whether pex <dig> levels were affected by pex <dig> overexpression, we compared pex <dig> levels in pex4- <dig> seedlings transformed with a genomic copy of pex <dig> or a pex <dig> cdna driven from the camv 35s promoter  <cit> . as previously shown  <cit> , both constructs fully rescued the sucrose dependence and iba resistance of dark-grown pex4- <dig> seedlings . moreover, the iba sensitivity, sucrose independence, and pex <dig> levels in these lines also resembled wild type following growth at 28 °c, despite the excess pex <dig> that accumulated in the 35s:pex <dig> line . these results suggest that pex <dig> is not limiting for pex <dig> degradation in wild type.

physiological and molecular defects of pex4- <dig> are enhanced by mutations in pex5
because overexpressing pex <dig> exacerbated pex4- <dig> mutant defects and because growth at high temperature ameliorated pex4- <dig> mutant defects while reducing pex <dig> levels, we assessed how reducing pex <dig> function through mutation would affect pex4- <dig> mutant defects. two arabidopsis pex <dig> mutants have been described: the missense pex5- <dig> allele  <cit>  specifically disrupts pts <dig> import  <cit>  whereas the pex5-10 t-dna insertion allele  <cit>  expresses reduced levels of a truncated pex <dig> product and disrupts both pts <dig> and pts <dig> import  <cit> . we found that the pex4- <dig> pex5- <dig> double mutant was more sucrose dependent  and iba resistant  than either single mutant and that these defects were not ameliorated by growth at elevated temperature . similarly, combining pex4- <dig> with pex5- <dig> resulted in seedlings that, like pex5- <dig>  remained fully sucrose dependent  and iba resistant  and were more impaired than pex5- <dig> when grown with sucrose supplementation . moreover, the germination defect of pex5- <dig>  <cit>  was exacerbated by pex4-1; double mutant seedlings germinated less efficiently than pex5- <dig> when incubated at 22 °c and generally failed to germinate when incubated at 28 °c, so we could not assess iba responsiveness or sucrose dependence of pex4- <dig> pex5- <dig> at elevated temperature.fig.  <dig> peroxisomal defects of pex4- <dig> are exacerbated by the pex5- <dig> and pex5- <dig> mutations.
a, b seedlings were grown as in the legend of fig.  <dig>  means of normalized dark-grown hypocotyl lengths and standard deviations of the means are shown . no bars are shown for pex4- <dig> pex5- <dig> at 28 °c because of extremely poor germination rate . c protein extracts of dark-grown seedlings from  <dig>  % sucrose-supplemented plant nutrient media were processed for immunoblotting. the membrane was serially probed with the indicated antibodies. thiolase is synthesized as a pts2-containing precursor  and cleaved in the peroxisome into a mature  form. hsc <dig> was used to monitor protein loading. the positions of molecular mass markers  are indicated on the left



immunoblotting revealed that growth at high temperature further reduced levels of the truncated pex5- <dig> protein but seemed to reduce the thiolase pts <dig> processing defect in pex5- <dig> . despite the enhanced physiological defects displayed by the double mutants , combining pex4- <dig> with pex5- <dig> or pex5- <dig> did not dramatically alter the thiolase pts <dig> processing defects .

growth at reduced temperature exacerbates the peroxisomal defects of pex4-1
because high temperature alleviated the pex4- <dig> physiological defects, we tested whether reduced growth temperature would intensify these defects. although growth at 15 °c did not appear to enhance the sucrose dependence of pex4- <dig> , we found that pex4- <dig> seedlings grown at 15 °c were more iba resistant than seedlings grown at 22 °c  whereas wild-type seedlings displayed robust iba responsiveness when grown at 15 °c. similarly, the pts <dig> processing defect of pex4- <dig> was more apparent following growth at reduced temperature . overexpressing pex <dig> exacerbated pex4- <dig> defects and growing at reduced temperature further worsened the thiolase pts <dig> processing defects of pex4- <dig> . moreover, pex <dig> levels, which did not vary markedly in wild-type seedlings grown at different temperatures, showed a clear negative correlation with growth temperature in the pex4- <dig> mutant, with more pex <dig> protein accumulating at cooler temperatures and less pex <dig> accumulating at elevated growth temperatures .fig.  <dig> low temperature worsens the peroxisomal defects of pex4- <dig>  seedlings were grown in the dark at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 32 °c with or without  <dig>  % sucrose  or 30 μm iba . means of normalized dark-grown hypocotyl lengths and standard deviation of the means are shown . c protein extracts of dark-grown seedlings from  <dig>  % sucrose-supplemented plant nutrient media were processed for immunoblotting. the membrane was serially probed with the indicated antibodies. thiolase is synthesized as a pts2-containing precursor  and cleaved in the peroxisome into a mature  form. hsc <dig> was used to monitor protein loading. the positions of molecular mass markers  are indicated on the left



pex <dig> is more membrane associated in pex4-1; high temperature does not rescue this defect
certain mutants defective in receptor-recycling peroxins, including pex4- <dig> and pex6- <dig>  display an elevated fraction of membrane-associated pex <dig>  <cit> . we hypothesized that high temperature might increase membrane fluidity and allow more efficient pex <dig> retrotranslocation in the pex4- <dig> mutant, thus explaining the observed physiological rescue. to test this idea, we used cellular fractionation coupled with immunoblotting to monitor pex <dig> localization in seedlings grown at  <dig> or 28 °c. as expected, the pex <dig> membrane peroxin was fully membrane associated in wild type and pex4- <dig> at either growth temperature . as previously observed in light-grown seedlings  <cit> , we found that in extracts from dark-grown wild-type seedlings, pex <dig> was mostly soluble following growth at 22 °c and that pex4- <dig> had a higher fraction of membrane-associated pex <dig> . we further found that growth at elevated temperature  did not notably alter pex <dig> membrane association in wild type. moreover, high temperature did not rescue the high membrane-associated pex <dig> defect in pex4-1; rather, the pex <dig> pellet/supernatant ratio was elevated further when pex4- <dig> was grown at high temperature . we concluded that the physiological rescue observed following growth of pex4- <dig> at high temperature did not result from restoration of pex <dig> retrotranslocation from the peroxisomal membrane.fig.  <dig> pex <dig> is more membrane associated in pex4-1; high temperature does not rescue this defect. extracts from dark-grown seedlings grown at 22 °c or 28 °c were cleared by a low-speed centrifugation to give homogenates . after a high-speed centrifugation, supernatants  were removed, and pellets were resuspended and spun at high speed to separate the wash supernatants  and final pellets . equal volumes of each fraction were processed for immunoblotting by sequential incubation of the membrane with the indicated antibodies. pex <dig> and mitochondrial  atp synthase are integral membrane proteins; hsc <dig> is mainly cytosolic. the positions of molecular mass markers  are indicated on the left. band intensities were quantified using imagej. for each sample, the supernatant, pellet, and wash were normalized to the corresponding homogenate to give the listed numbers



pex <dig> recognizes and delivers pts <dig> cargo, but the pex <dig> recycling mechanism is not well understood. unlike pex <dig> levels, pex <dig> levels  or membrane association  did not noticeably change following growth at elevated temperature.

high temperature-induced pex <dig> reduction in pex4- <dig> is not due to autophagy
because growth at elevated temperature reduced overall pex <dig> levels in the pex4- <dig> mutant, we explored the molecular basis of this reduction. we first tested for the involvement of autophagy in pex <dig> degradation. in macroautophagy, an isolation membrane selectively engulfs specific or general cellular components for ultimate degradation in the vacuole  <cit> . atg <dig> is required for lipidation of the ubiquitin-like atg <dig> that marks the isolation membrane  <cit>  and is thus required for autophagy of peroxisomes   <cit> . we found that preventing autophagy by crossing pex4- <dig> to the atg7- <dig> null allele  <cit>  did not increase pex <dig> accumulation in pex4- <dig> at either growth temperature , suggesting that high temperature-induced pex <dig> reduction in pex4- <dig> does not require autophagy.fig.  <dig> high temperature-induced pex <dig> reduction in pex4- <dig> does not require autophagy. plants were grown as in the legend of fig.  <dig>  protein extracts of dark-grown seedlings from  <dig>  % sucrose-supplemented plant nutrient media were processed for immunoblotting. the membrane was serially probed with the indicated antibodies. hsc <dig> was used to monitor protein loading. band intensities were quantified using imagej. the levels of pex <dig> or pex <dig> were normalized to the corresponding hsc <dig> band prior to normalizing to the 22 °c wild-type band to give the listed numbers



mg <dig> treatment implicates ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation in regulating pex <dig> levels
in yeast, ubiquitinated pex <dig> is retrotranslocated from the membrane by the pex1-pex <dig> atpase complex for recycling, but if this retrotranslocation is slowed, ubiquitination promotes pex <dig> degradation by the proteasome  <cit> . a role for the proteasome in arabidopsis pex <dig> degradation has not been directly demonstrated but is implied by the reduced pex <dig> levels found in the arabidopsis pex6- <dig> mutant  <cit> . to test proteasomal involvement in arabidopsis pex <dig> degradation, we used a proteasome inhibitor, mg <dig>  to slow ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation  <cit> . we found that pex <dig> levels were similarly elevated following a 24-h mg <dig> treatment at both normal and elevated temperature in wild type , suggesting that pex <dig> can normally be degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. pex <dig> levels in pex4- <dig> grown at either normal or elevated temperature were also increased by mg <dig> treatment , suggesting that the proteasome contributes to pex <dig> degradation in pex4- <dig> as well. interestingly, the relative increase in pex <dig> levels following mg <dig> treatment was greater in pex4- <dig> grown at elevated temperature than in wild type, suggesting that pex <dig> degradation by the proteasome is enhanced in pex4- <dig> mutants grown at elevated temperature. in contrast to pex <dig> levels, the levels of pex <dig> were largely unchanged in this experiment , demonstrating that not all peroxins were similarly sensitive to mg <dig> treatment.fig.  <dig> pex <dig> degradation is reduced following treatment with the mg <dig> proteasome inhibitor. one-day stratification and one-day preincubation were performed prior to plating. plates were placed in yellow light at 22 °c for one day and wrapped in aluminum foil at 22 °c for three days. seedlings were moved to  <dig>  % sucrose-supplemented liquid plant nutrient media with or without 50 μm mg <dig> in the dark for 24 h at  <dig> or 28 °c. protein extracts of dark-grown seedlings were processed for immunoblotting. the membrane was serially probed with the indicated antibodies. thiolase is synthesized as a pts2-containing precursor  that is cleaved in the peroxisome to the mature  form. hsc <dig> was used to monitor protein loading. band intensities were quantified using imagej. the levels of pex <dig> and pex <dig> were normalized to the corresponding hsc <dig> band prior to normalizing to the 22 °c non-mg132-treated wild-type band to give the listed numbers



we also observed that the pts2-containing precursor of thiolase accumulated to higher levels in pex4- <dig> and pex6- <dig> mutants following mg <dig> treatment . this result suggests that mislocalized cytosolic thiolase can be degraded by the proteasome or that the matrix protein import defects of these mutants were worsened by mg <dig> treatment.

discussion
pex <dig> is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme tethered to the peroxisome by pex <dig>  <cit> . pex <dig> is necessary for peroxisomal matrix protein import, probably via its role in ubiquitinating the pex <dig> matrix protein receptor, which allows efficient retrotranslocation of pex <dig> from the membrane by the pex1-pex <dig> atpase complex   <cit> . the arabidopsis pex4- <dig> mutant is caused by a pro123leu missense mutation and displays a variety of phenotypes suggestive of peroxisome deficiencies, including sucrose dependence, iba resistance, inefficient pts <dig> processing  <cit> , pts <dig> import defects  <cit> , and elevated membrane-associated pex <dig>  <cit> . mounting evidence suggests that pex <dig> lingering in the membrane is harmful to peroxisome physiology. for example, overexpressing pex <dig> confers sucrose dependence and enhances pts <dig> processing defects in arabidopsis pex10- <dig>  a mutant defective in one of the ring-finger peroxins  <cit> . furthermore, slightly reducing levels of pex <dig>  which assists in docking pex <dig> at the membrane  <cit> , ameliorates the physiological defects of pex4- <dig>  <cit> . in this work, we found that overexpressing pex <dig> exacerbated the sucrose dependence, iba resistance, and pts <dig> processing defects of the pex4- <dig> mutant . these findings are consistent with the hypotheses that the pex <dig> ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme normally promotes pex <dig> retrotranslocation from the peroxisomal membrane and that pex <dig> impairs peroxisome physiology if not promptly removed from the membrane after cargo delivery.fig.  <dig> a working model for high-temperature amelioration of pex4- <dig> physiological defects. a in wild type, pex <dig> recognizes and delivers pts <dig> cargo into peroxisomes. the peroxisome-tethered ubiquitin conjugating enzyme  and ring finger peroxins  collaborate to ubiquitinate pex <dig>  ubiquitinated pex <dig> is recycled back to the cytosol by the pex1-pex <dig> atpase complex. b at normal growth temperature , mutations in pex <dig> slow pex <dig> recycling, resulting in elevated membrane-associated pex <dig>  which contributes to pex <dig> physiological defects. these defects are amplified by pex <dig> overexpression, implying that these defects do not exclusively result from reduced matrix protein import. c at high temperature , an unknown ubiquitination enzyme  promotes ubiquitin-dependent pex <dig> degradation, reducing overall pex <dig> levels and ameliorating pex <dig> defects



various environmental stimuli can affect peroxisome numbers and functions in plant cells. for example, cadmium and salinity treatments induce production of reactive nitrogen species in peroxisomes . slightly elevated temperature is associated with increased peroxisome numbers in norway spruce   <cit>  and salt  stress promotes peroxisome proliferation in arabidopsis roots  <cit> . however, the interplay of the environment on peroxisomes in plants with compromised peroxisome function remains largely unexplored. in this study, we found that pex <dig> levels are reduced following growth of receptor recycling mutants at elevated temperature , suggesting that the activity of the receptor recycling machinery might be temperature-dependent.

we found that growth at elevated temperature rescued the sucrose dependence of dark-grown pex4- <dig> seedlings  and ameliorated the pex4- <dig> thiolase pts2-processing defect  whereas growth at decreased temperature had opposite effects . pex <dig> levels decreased at high temperature , suggesting that the observed phenotypic rescue was not due to restoration of pex <dig> levels in the mutant. importantly, the elevated ratio of membrane-associated versus cytosolic pex <dig> in pex4- <dig> was not corrected by growth at high temperature , indicating that high temperature did not restore pex4- <dig> enzymatic activity or increase membrane fluidity to facilitate pex <dig> retrotranslocation. reduced overall pex <dig> levels accompanied the amelioration of pex4- <dig> physiological defects at high temperature , further supporting the conclusion that membrane-associated pex <dig> impairs peroxisome function in pex4- <dig>  blocking autophagy did not prevent the high temperature-induced pex <dig> reduction in pex4- <dig> , suggesting that pex <dig> was not degraded by autophagy at high temperature in pex4- <dig>  in contrast, using mg <dig> to slow ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation restored pex <dig> levels in pex4- <dig> grown at high temperature to wild-type levels . interestingly, proteasomal degradation also can contribute to heat stress resistance in rice  <cit> . together, our data are consistent with a model in which high temperature promotes ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of pex <dig> in pex4- <dig>  which reduces membrane-associated pex <dig> and relieves pex4- <dig> physiological defects .

in yeast, the pts <dig> cargo receptor pex <dig>  together with the docking peroxin pex <dig>  forms transient pores in the peroxisomal membrane to deliver cargo into peroxisomes  <cit> . pex <dig> assists the ring-finger peroxins in ubiquitinating pex <dig>  <cit> , allowing pex <dig> to be returned to the cytosol and thereby removing the membrane pore. how pex <dig> topology changes as it cycles between a soluble protein in the cytosol and an integral protein in the peroxisomal membrane is not known. moreover, it is not clear why overexpressing pex <dig> worsens defects in certain peroxisomal mutants . we speculate that the excess membrane-associated pex <dig> in pex4- <dig>  might still be in the pore conformation, altering peroxisome matrix ph, redox status, and/or cofactor availability, thereby disrupting peroxisome metabolism and contributing to the observed physiological defects in pex4- <dig> 

although high-temperature induced reductions in pex <dig> levels were associated with ameliorated pex4- <dig> peroxisomal defects , and although pex <dig> overexpression  and low-temperature induced increases in pex <dig> levels  were associated with worsened pex4- <dig> defects, reducing pex <dig> function by mutation did not reduce pex4- <dig> defects. in fact, the pex4- <dig> pex5- <dig> and pex4- <dig> pex5- <dig> double mutants displayed exaggerated peroxisome-related physiological defects compared to the parents . this enhancement suggests that the pex5- <dig> and pex5- <dig> proteins, which do not efficiently import peroxisomal matrix proteins  <cit> , confer additional detriment to peroxisome function when not efficiently retrotranslocated . we expect that a pex <dig> mutation that reduces pex <dig> protein levels without otherwise impairing pex <dig> function might ameliorate the peroxisomal defects of pex4- <dig>  as suggested by the finding that slightly reducing levels of the pex <dig> docking peroxin reduces the physiological defects of pex4- <dig> without notably impairing peroxisome function  <cit> .

yeast pex <dig> is required for pexophagy  <cit> , and yeast mutants lacking pex <dig> display elevated pex <dig> levels  <cit> , consistent with the possibility that pex <dig> might directly or indirectly promote pexophagy as well. in mammalian cells, pex <dig> brings the tuberous sclerosis complex to the peroxisome, where it regulates the mtorc pathway and autophagy to suppress tumor formation  <cit> . the wxxx motif in the n-terminal region of pex <dig> that binds pex <dig> during pts <dig> cargo delivery  is similar to the wxxl atg8-binding sequence that targets proteins to the autophagy machinery  <cit> . although pexophagy recently has been described in arabidopsis  <cit> , the roles of individual plant peroxins in this process have not been reported. we found no evidence that pexophagy was generally induced in pex4-1; levels of the peroxisomal membrane proteins pex <dig> and apx <dig> were not reduced in pex4- <dig> . interestingly, pex <dig> protein was generally less abundant following growth at elevated temperature , and blocking autophagy moderated this decline and partially restored pex <dig> levels in pex4- <dig> . these results suggest that autophagy might contribute to pex <dig> degradation at high temperature.

human peroxisome biogenesis disorders  are genetic diseases caused by peroxin mutations and lack effective treatments. pbd patients have developmental delays and neuropathies that often result in early mortality  <cit> . arabidopsis peroxisomal mutants share some molecular phenotypes with fibroblasts from pbd patients. for example, both human cells with mutations in pex <dig>  <cit>  and arabidopsis pex6- <dig> mutants  <cit>  have low pex <dig> levels . interestingly, low temperature increases membrane-association of pex <dig> in normal human cells  <cit>  and increases peroxisomal import in cells from a pbd patient carrying a pex <dig> mutation  <cit> . it is possible that low temperature slows pex <dig> degradation and increases pex <dig> levels in pex6-deficient cells. here, we discovered that growth at high temperature reduced overall pex <dig> levels in the arabidopsis pex4- <dig> mutant. together, these results reinforce the idea that therapies targeting pex <dig> levels or localization might improve peroxisome functioning in certain pbd patients.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose a model  in which pex <dig> in the pex4- <dig> mutant lingers on the peroxisomal membrane, which impairs peroxisomal functioning. when pex4- <dig> seedlings are grown at high temperature, overall pex <dig> levels are reduced via an mg132-inhibitable mechanism, presumably proteasomal degradation. this degradation reduces pex <dig> accumulation on the peroxisomal membrane. our results suggest that efficient removal of pex <dig> from the peroxisome after cargo delivery is needed not simply to make pex <dig> available for further import rounds but also to prevent the peroxisome dysfunction that results from pex <dig> lingering in the peroxisomal membrane.
