BACKGROUND
drought is one of the most important environmental stresses around the world
 <cit> . the climate changes and increasing population pose serious challenges to crop improvement. it is believed that understanding of how plants respond to drought stress at the molecular level are useful for developing improved genotypes which would perform well under water-limited conditions
 <cit> . maize , one of the most important food crops in the world, is very sensitive to water-deficiency, especially during flowering, pollination and embryo development
 <cit> .

previous studies reaffirmed that drought tolerance is a complex trait controlled by many genes
 <cit> . it is important to mine candidate genes and unravel molecular mechanisms in response to drought stress in maize, which would help accelerate genetic improvement through marker-assisted selection. so far, genetic studies using strategies such as quantitative trait locus  mapping, subtractive hybridization , real time-pcr and cdna microarray technology, have been reported in maize
 <cit> . however, qtl identified under a specific genetic background usually show relatively small effects or even cannot be detected under other genetic backgrounds
 <cit> , and several studies have been done to integrate the results from multiple independent qtl mapping experiments to unravel genetic factors underlying complex traits
 <cit> .

despite the surfeit of mapping publications, only a few qtl have been identified to date at the gene level through map-based cloning due to the complexity of the maize genome
 <cit> , resulting in largely unknown mechanisms of drought response. the next-generation sequencing  technologies, which provide direct insight into the dna variation, have been used for genome-wide sequencing , polymorphism detection and marker development, dna methylation and histone modification, alternative splicing identification, gene expression analysis and dna-protein interactions
 <cit> . ngs has also become a vital choice for identifying candidate genes and variants underlying simple and even complex traits through linkage mapping, association mapping and other approaches
 <cit> . a known qtl  associated with rice grain width was successfully identified using 209 k snps that were produced by whole-genome resequencing of a recombinant inbred line population
 <cit> . besides, transcriptome sequencing is also applied in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation analyses of genes under abiotic stress and global expression pattern analysis of complex genomes
 <cit> . the transcriptome of maize reference genome b <dig> was studied using rna-seq to compare gene expression in fertilized ovaries and basal leaf meristem tissues collected under drought-treated and well-watered conditions
 <cit> . moreover maize mirnas regulating abiotic stress-associated processes and the gene networks were identified, and a gene model showing how they worked was proposed
 <cit> .

finding and exploiting dna sequence variation within a genome is of utmost importance for crop genetics and breeding. thanks to the availability of whole-genome or transcriptome sequences in public databases and the recent advent of bioinformatics tools, mining genetic variation has become easier and more cost-effective. the objectives of this study are to 1) screen snps that play important roles in maize drought tolerance using genome-wide sequencing data; 2) identify corresponding candidate genes based on the identified nssnps and compare them with reported qtl for drought tolerance; 3) detect changes in expression level of these candidate genes using rna-seq data from different maize tissues under two water treatments. the candidate genes could be the fundamental genetic resource for enhancement of maize drought tolerance, and their expression analysis and insight into molecular mechanisms would be helpful for molecular breeding towards improving abiotic stress adaptation.

RESULTS
snps and their distribution in maize genome
whole-genome resequencing was performed for  <dig> maize inbreds and a total of  <dig>  billion  sequence reads were aligned against the maize b <dig> reference genome using short oligonucleotide alignment program  <dig> 
 <cit> , resulting in 85% of genome coverage on average. the detailed resequencing information was provided in additional file
1: table s <dig>  a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps with high quality were called from  <dig> maize inbreds and b <dig> reference genome. the number of snps was the most on chromosome  <dig>  and the least on chromosome  <dig> , accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the snps, respectively. snp density varied among chromosomes, and chromosome  <dig> has the highest density with  <dig>  snps per kb and chromosome  <dig> has the lowest density with  <dig>  snps per kb .

chr chromosome. nonsyn: nonsynonymous snps. syn synonymous snps. adensity: snp number per kb. b stop-gain: changes an amino acid to a stop codon. cstop-loss: the mutation results in the loss of a stop codon. d5′-utr, 3′-utr: snps located in 5′-utr or 3′-utr of different transcripts. esplicing sites: snps in different genomic regions refer to alternative splicing.

the distribution of snps across genomic regions was compared . snps were most abundant in intergenic regions , followed in an order of intronic, promotor, exonic, utr and splicing site regions. notably, more snps were located in 3’-utr  than in 5′-utr . moreover, more snps were detected in the introns  than exons . for exonic regions, there were  <dig>  synonymous snps,  <dig>  nssnps,  <dig> stop-gain and  <dig> stop-loss mutations. synonymous snps were more abundant and the average non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratio  was  <dig>  in the exonic regions.

detection of nssnps and candidate genes using common variants  analysis
annovar tool was applied to filter nssnps
 <cit> . three extremely drought-tolerant lines and three drought-sensitive lines were used to detect candidate nssnps
 <cit> . there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  nssnps sharing the same variants within drought sensitive group and drought tolerant group, respectively. the variants distributed across genome regions showed different densities between the two groups . there were more variants located in telomeric regions than in near centromere regions, which was in accordance with the distribution patterns of genes in maize
 <cit> . among the variants,  <dig> nssnps  associated with  <dig> genes  were different between the groups . chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig> each contained some candidate genes, while most of the candidate genes lay on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the gene transcripts selected by cv analysis are listed in additional file
2: table s <dig> 

among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> contained more than one nssnps. in particular, candidate genes grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig> and grmzm2g <dig> harbored  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nssnps with nonsyn/syn ratios of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. grmzm2g <dig>  a member of calmodulin-binding superfamily, has been demonstrated to be an important signalling component in stress-induced cellular signal transduction pathway
 <cit> . grmzm2g <dig>  which encodes a keratin-associated protein participated in the formation of rigid and resistant hair shafts in mammalian
 <cit> , was proven to be involved in water stress signaling pathway
 <cit> .

to explore selective constrains and evolutionary divergence of these genes, the nonsyn/syn ratio for each candidate gene identified by cv analysis was also investigated using different maize germplasm sets. among these genes,  <dig> %  only have nssnps in coding region. the nonsyn/syn ratios for candidate genes ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , with an average of  <dig> , of which,  <dig> genes with the ratios below  <dig>  while  <dig> genes above  <dig> . we also calculated the average nonsyn/syn ratio of candidate genes using the data from maize hapmap  <dig>  which were collected from a much larger set of germplasm including wild, landrace and improved maize lines
 <cit> . the mean nonsyn/syn ratio was  <dig>  . most of the genes  were under purifying selection with the nonsyn/syn ratios below  <dig>  . in contrast, only  <dig> % of the genes  were under positive selection with nonsyn/syn ratios above  <dig>  .

variants on chromosome  <dig> revealed by cluster analysis
to select candidate loci related to drought tolerance, snp-based cluster analysis proposed by james silva et al. was carried out with minor modification using all nssnps identified with all tested lines
 <cit> . the nssnps detected on each chromosome with the tested maize inbreds were used for singular value decomposition  and ward’s minimum variance clustering. we used average variant frequency  with more than  <dig>  in extremely drought-tolerant lines but less than  <dig>  in extremely drought-sensitive lines to decide the number k of clusters. when the clustered number reached  <dig>  the avfs on chromosome  <dig> showed distinct difference between the two groups. the avf values were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> for the three drought sensitive inbreds, ye <dig>  ji <dig> and b <dig>  while they were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for the three drought tolerant inbreds, lx <dig>  qi <dig> and tie <dig>  respectively. when the cluster number was less than  <dig>  the drought-tolerant inbred qi <dig> had a lower avf value  and the drought-susceptive inbred ji <dig> had a modest avf value . therefore, the  <dig> nssnps grouped in single cluster  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> were selected to represent candidate loci related to drought tolerance. a total of  <dig> candidate genes , which were associated with the clustered snps, are summarized in additional file
2: table s <dig>  comparing the physical positions with chromosome bin regions of candidate nssnps for drought tolerance, we found that  <dig> % of candidate nssnps were clustered in bin  <dig>  , and these nssnps were related to genes involved in aba and cytokinin catabolism, stress signal conduction and redox reaction.

biplot was created using the clustered nssnps to display the relationships between drought-susceptive inbreds and the candidate nssnps. figure 
 <dig> showed the biplot of variants on chromosome  <dig>  six inbred lines could be divided into two groups using the first and second eigenvectors, which is in accordance with their drought characteristics. the three extremely drought sensitive lines were located around the same region while the drought tolerant lines lx <dig> and qi <dig> located in the opposite direction of the drought sensitive lines.

comparison of candidate genes with previously identified qtl/genes
both of the cv and cluster analyses successfully identified candidate genes for drought tolerance. a total of  <dig> nssnps were identified by two methods, among which,  <dig> common variants associated with  <dig> genes were detected by both methods , which account for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the candidate genes revealed by cv strategy and cluster analysis, respectively. more interestingly, we found  <dig> out of the  <dig> common variants were clustered in bin  <dig>  . in addition, we compared the candidate genes with  <dig> qtl for drought tolerance on chromosome  <dig> retrieved from gramene database  and nine published research articles using different mapping populations and algorithms
 <cit> . of the  <dig> qtl, one for female flowering time
 <cit> , two for grain yield
 <cit> , one for ear number
 <cit> , one for stressed-leaf aba content
 <cit>  and one for asi 
 <cit>  were detected in bin  <dig> . the distribution of reported qtl and candidate nssnps on chromosome  <dig> are shown in figure 
4c. the qtl explained relatively high proportions of phenotypic variation . the  <dig> candidate genes identified by cluster analysis shared the same chromosomal region in bin  <dig>  . these genes were involved in plant hormone regulation, carbonhydrate and sugar metabolism, signalling molecules regulation, redox reaction and acclimation of photosynthesis to environment.

among the candidate genes identified in bin  <dig> , cytochrome p <dig>  encodes a key enzyme in aba catabolism and plays a major regulatory role in controlling the level of aba in plants
 <cit> . grmzm2g <dig> is a type-a arabidopsis response regulator , which is rapidly induced by cytokinin and is a partially redundant negative regulator of cytokinin signaling
 <cit> . grmzm2g <dig> encodes a subunit of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, which is a key enzyme of the starch biosynthesis pathway
 <cit> . grmzm2g <dig> is glucosyltransferase involved in glucuronoxylan biosynthesis and drought tolerance in arabidopsis
 <cit> . the putative calmodulin-binding protein  and leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase family protein  play important roles in signal transduction and drought response
 <cit> . besides, induction of peroxidase is a common feature of all the stress treatments
 <cit> , and grmzm2g <dig>  a peroxidase  <dig> precursor, maybe involved in the stress response.

go enrichment analysis of selected candidate genes
go based functional enrichment analysis of drought-tolerant candidate genes was performed by the web-based tools agrigo   and agbase . the results revealed that  <dig> go terms showed significant differences between the candidate genes and all the b <dig> genes pre-computated as background reference, including  <dig> go terms  involved in biological processes and  <dig> go terms  involved in cellular components. there was no go term in the category of molecular function. the most enriched terms of biological process ontology were development- and cellular response-related, such as developmental process , multicellular organismal development , anatomical structure development , system development , response to biotic stimulus , cellular response to chemical stimulus  and response to other organisms . on the other hand, there was also a significant difference in negative regulation of biological process , negative regulation of cellular process  and chromatin modification . to the cellular component ontology, candidate genes were enriched in membrane and vesicle related cellular component including the membrane-bounded organelle , intracellular membrane-bounded organelle , cytoplasmic part , vesicle , plastid  and membrane-bounded vesicle .

a detailed comparison of biological process groups involved in drought responses to background is provided in figure 
 <dig>  with the biological process ontology, developmental process  and signalling , multicellular organismal process  and response to stimulus  were enriched for the drought response candidate genes. meanwhile, negative regulation of biological process  and death  also showed a relatively high rate than the all given genes from reference genome b <dig> as background.

validation of candidate genes
to validate whether the selected candidate genes respond to drought tolerance, we examined expression level changes of  <dig> candidate genes through transcriptome analysis of the roots from drought tolerant inbred ac <dig>  and the leaves and ovaries from drought sensitive inbred line b <dig> under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. the fold changes of candidate genes expression responsive to water stress in ovaries, leaves and roots are displayed in figures 
1d,e and f, respectively. a total of  <dig> genes revealed by cv and cluster strategy showed change of their expression levels in different water conditions, of which  <dig> genes  changed significantly  and  <dig> genes had a fold change of more than two in ovaries, leaves or roots. in drought tolerant inbred ac <dig>   <dig> genes displayed significantly different expression in roots under two water treatments, including  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes. the expression level of aserine/threonine-protein kinase family member  substantially changed, with a 7-fold-increase under water-stress condition. a hypothetical protein  exhibited a more than 9-fold decrease in expression level under water-stress condition. although the candidate genes showed different expression characters due to the different tissues and inbreds used for rna sequencing, the relatively high rate of genes significantly altered their expression levels under water-stress condition, which indicated these candidate genes identified by cv and cluster strategies were associated with drought tolerance. expression level difference of candidate genes in ovaries, leaves and roots under two water treatments and the expression change based hierarchical clustering are shown in heat map with different colors representing relative mrna expression .

validation of snps
to verify the accuracy of snps, comparison of the  <dig>  loci identified from illumina snp50k chip and snps called from  <dig> resequencing inbreds were performed. the results indicated that more than 99% of snps were in accordance with the physical positions and genotypes. the snp discordant rates between two datasets were presented in additional file
1: table s <dig>  in addition, all the  <dig> inbred lines were used for snp validation through pcr amplification and hrm validation. five candidate genes were randomly selected for validation and corresponding five primer pairs were designed . the hrm result of pcr amplicons for the candidate gene grmzm2g <dig> is shown in figure 
 <dig>  the two groups with snp locus “a” in red curves and “g” in green curves in  <dig> inbred lines were distinguished successfully. the sequence of amplicon with the snp in “a” had a lower melting temperature compared with single base mutation of “g”. the difference in melt temperature indicated the snp existed in the chosen maize inbred lines. the hrm genotyping results also confirmed that the candidate nssnps were consistent with the sequences generated by ngs.

discussion
functional and regulatory genes for drought tolerance in maize
plant roots have the ability to grow toward the direction of high water availability and away from that of high osmolarity . xiong et al. searched for phenotypes conferred by drought stress and identified the inhibition of lateral root development by drought stress as an adaptive response to the stress
 <cit> . ovaries in tissue subjected to drought stress stop growth within  <dig> to 2 day after pollination
 <cit> , and tolerance to water stress in female floral parts has been correlated with yield in maize
 <cit> . gene expression studies in maize in response to water stress have been conducted in roots
 <cit> , seedlings
 <cit> , and developing ear and tassel
 <cit> . in the study, transcriptome analysis of leaves, ovaries and roots from drought sensitive inbred and tolerance inbred was thus performed to further validate the candidate genes and elucidate mechanisms for its regulation.

the response of plants to drought stress is very complex and involves lots of genes and pathways related to diverse mechanisms
 <cit> . however, some secondary physiological traits have been investigated as a drought tolerance measurement and some universal genes, such as nac transcription factors, are involved in abiotic stress response in different varieties and even species
 <cit> . this provides us an opportunity to mine important universal drought response genes by assessing the variations capably inducing modification of the protein sequences in maize inbreds with different genetic backgrounds.

in this study, we identified genes involved in plant hormone regulation , carbonhydrate and sugar metabolism, signalling molecules regulation and redox reaction. these genes may function as regulatory protein factors involved in the regulation of signal transduction and gene expression functioning in stress responses
 <cit> . one of the major unresolved issues concerning the genetic architecture of abiotic stress response is whether functional variation arises from variation in core signaling components, such as transcription factor, kinases and phosphatases, or these variations are confined to effector genes, such as biosynthetic enzymes, redox regulators and heat shock proteins
 <cit> . gene families with essential functions  in rice tended to have substantially lower nonsyn/syn ratios, whereas gene families that functioned in regulatory processes and signal recognition, such as disease resistance family, had higher ratios
 <cit> . in our research, candidate genes with more than  <dig> nssnps involving in stress signaling pathway and functioning as regulators also had higher nonsyn/syn ratios, which were consistent with the results in rice.

on the other hand, from an evolutionary viewpoint, more than 70% of the candidate genes were under negative selection with a relatively low average nonsyn/syn ratios in both maize inbred lines population and a much larger set of germplasm including wild, landrace and improved maize lines. the result indicated that these genes possess central and essential functions and nonsynonymous mutations impacting on the genes function have been removed by purifying selection
 <cit> . a similar result was observed in eucalyptus camaldulensis seedlings subjected to water stress via transcriptome sequencing
 <cit> .

cv and cluster analyses for mining candidate genes
recent advances in whole-genome sequencing have allowed identification of candidate genes responsible for abiotic and biotic stresses. silva et al. used cv and principal component-biplot  selection strategy to exploit whole genome sequences of  <dig> rice inbred lines and identify nssnps and candidate genes for resistance to sheath blight, a disease of worldwide significance
 <cit> . in our study, both cv and cluster analyses successfully identified the candidate genes associated with drought tolerance. gene expression studies through rna-seq on ovaries and basal leaves of drought sensitive inbred b <dig> confirmed that around 80% of the candidate genes showed decreased or increased expression under water-stress condition
 <cit> . moreover, transcriptome analysis conducted on the roots of drought tolerant inbred ac <dig> validated  <dig> % of candidate genes displayed significantly different expression under water-stressed conditions, including  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes. interestingly, the candidate genes identified by cv analysis showed more significant and severe change in expression level, indicating that cv analysis might be more efficient than clustering. however, from methodology perspective, the procedure of cv analysis is somewhat tedious while cluster analysis is more systematic as described by silva et al.
 <cit> . besides, cluster analysis has another advantage that the candidate loci identified can be clustered in some chromosomal regions. in our analysis, the majority of candidate nssnps detected by cluster analysis were located in bin  <dig> , accounting for  <dig> % of the total candidate nssnps. compared with the reported qtl for drought tolerance, this chromosomal region  harbored important qtl involving in flowering time and grain yield under water-stress condition, suggesting that cluster analysis was credible and successful in mining candidate genes for the target traits in our study. moreover, more than 10% of the candidate genes could be identified by both methods, most of which were clustered on chromosome  <dig> . for a large number of clusters, candidate snps identified by both methods were almost indistinguishable
 <cit> .

functions of snps in different genomic regions
snps were very commonly used for association studies to identify genes or genetic regions contributing to complex traits
 <cit> . from these genome-wide researches, snps could be identified in almost all genomic regions to explain variation of phenotypic traits to various degrees. from the point of view of molecular level, functional snps can affect the phenotype by interfering both transcription level and protein synthesis
 <cit> . it has been long considered that the snps on protein-coding sequences have potential effects on gene function, especially the nssnps that could lead to amino acid residue changes and altered functional or structural properties of the protein. although the non-coding snps could not cause any amino acid change, they may affect transcription factor binding sites, splice sites and other functional sites in transcriptional level. in maize, 21% of the snps in hapmap  <dig> were associated with a genic region
 <cit> , which suggested that the polymorphisms in coding sequences were less than non-coding areas. furthermore, li et al. analyzed genic and non-genic contributions to natural variation of quantitative traits in maize and revealed that 79% of the explained variation could be attributed to trait-associated snps located in genes or within 5 kb uptream of genes
 <cit> . this indicates that variations in genic and promotor regions would be more important in genetic resolution of complex traits. the less in numbers but more significant in terms of functions has made the nssnps an ideal marker type in complex trait association analysis. more than  <dig> genes with selected nssnps for resistance to sheath blight disease were detected in rice by whole-genome sequencing. in the study, we focus on the nssnps and drought associated candidate genes within nssnps were successfully detected by comparative analysis of different maize inbred lines.

genetic resources for drought tolerance in maize
maize is an important crop for food, feed, forage, and fuel across tropical and temperate areas of the world. diversity studies at genetic, molecular, and functional levels have revealed that tropical maize germplasms, landraces and wild relatives harbor a significantly wider range of genetic variation. landraces from dry habitats have been used successfully in breeding for water limited environments, and wild species and progenitors of our cultivated crops were always on the agenda as possible donors for drought tolerance
 <cit> .

from an evolutionary perspective, drought is an important abiotic stress that influences yield with strong interactions between genes and environment
 <cit> , which was also an important evolutionary force responsible for population diversification in some species
 <cit> . plants exhibit morphological and physiological adaptations to cope with environmental stresses. however, evidence for selection  of drought tolerance has rarely been examined in maize. many researches have indicated that, the ancestor of maize, teosinte, is a drought tolerant grass while domesticated landraces and inbred lines have differentiated in drought tolerance. as a result, some landraces and inbred lines are drought tolerant while others are drought susceptible. back to the process of domestication, drought tolerance might be selected together with plant productivity in farming practice, and comparing with wild type, domesticated plants reduced defense ability exposure to biotic and abiotic stresses 
 <cit> . therefore, identifying more drought tolerance genes and exploring the nature of drought tolerance may open new avenues for their use in maize improvement.

the advent of whole genomics technologies provides necessary tools for identifying the key gene networks that respond to drought stress
 <cit> . based on all available knowledge for the traits related to yield and drought tolerance, randomly dispersed qtl, trans-genes or both can be accumulated into elite genotypes through “breeding by design”
 <cit> . better understanding of the genetic bases of the secondary drought tolerance traits and analysis of allelic variation at the corresponding loci would enable the breeders to design new ideotype crops.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> nssnps were selected by cv analysis and clustering using b <dig> reference genome and whole-genome resequencing of  <dig> maize inbreds with various drought characteristics. two hundred seventy one drought-tolerant candidate genes corresponding to the candidate nssnps were identified, which involved in a variety of physiological and metabolic pathways in response to the water stress. go based function analysis and comparison of candidate genes with reported drought associated qtl indicated that these candidate genes were notably associated with drought tolerance. furthermore, about 70% of candidate genes showed significantly expression change under two water conditions by transcriptome analysis of fertilized ovaries, basal leaves and roots. two methods used in the study are efficient approaches for detecting candidate genes underlying complex traits, including drought tolerance. results from this study also provide a foundation for future basic research and marker-assisted breeding for improving drought tolerance in maize.
