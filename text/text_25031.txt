BACKGROUND
tree peony  is a perennial deciduous shrub with excellent ornamental and medicinal values  <cit> . it is indigenous to china and the ornamental cultivation has a history of more than 2000 years  <cit> . the legume of tree peony has a star-shaped fruit. it contains dark oval seeds characterized by abundant unsaturated fatty acids  and a high proportion of n- <dig> fatty acids, which has been linked with all kinds of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, etc.  <cit> . specially, α-linolenic acid  in tree peony oil accounts for circa 45% of the total fa content, whilst linoleic acid  and oleic acid  comprise ca. 26% and 21%, respectively  <cit> . with the exception of perilla seed and flaxseed oil, such high levels of n- <dig> fas are uncommon in seed oils. tree peony seeds are also abundant in phenolic and monoterpene glycosides, which are used for food and pharmaceutical purpose  <cit> .

it is generally known that n- <dig> fas are essential dietary nutrients, but cannot be synthesized by the human body independently. the recommended dietary n- <dig> to n- <dig> fa ratio is lower than 5: <dig>  <cit> . a lack of n- <dig> dietary intake causes the high ratio in our daily diet up to as much as 15: <dig> to 20: <dig>  due to the increasing accumulation of environmental pollutants and overharvesting, plants rich in n- <dig> fas may offer a sustainable source of these essential fas instead of fish. currently, the most significant vegetable dietary form of n- <dig> fas is ala. however, ala in most common edible oil, such as olive oil, corn oil, peanut oil, camellia oil, sesame oil and sunflower oil, is less than 3%  <cit> . considerable research efforts are being put towards the exploration of new ala-enriched resources, including the seeds of sacha inchi , tree peony , sea buckthorn , cypress , and cress , etc.  <cit> . the unique health benefit of tree peony oil lies in the low n- <dig> to n- <dig> ratio , and it could be sustainable exploited as an alternative source of edible oil. simultaneously, it is a good model to dissect metabolic pathways involved in ufa biosynthesis.

the increased ease and efficiency of rna sequencing  tools will facilitate the study of the mechanisms underlying metabolite variation. de novo transcriptome sequencing has enabled the rapid identification and profiling of differentially expressed genes in flaxseed  <cit> , castor bean  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , olive  <cit> , peanut  <cit> , sea buckthorn  <cit> , sacha inchi  <cit> , and oil palm  <cit> . these oilseed datasets provide large numbers of targeted gene information and can be referenced. however, due to the temporal and spatial characteristics of transcriptome, it is essential to explore the transcriptome of tree peony seeds during its development for further understanding the molecular mechanism of lipid biosynthesis. nevertheless, most tree peony researchers committed to the molecular mechanism of flower bud development  <cit> , endo-dormancy  <cit> , reblooming  <cit> , and prolonging vase life of cut flowers  <cit> . the physiological mechanism responsible for ufa biosynthesis remains unknown, meanwhile, the genetic control of the ala accumulation is currently unexplored. in this study, we analyzed the fa compositions in developing tree peony seeds and generated the first tree peony seed transcriptome using high-throughput illumina sequencing technology to uncover genes related to oil biosynthesis. in total,  <dig>  contigs were obtained from six tree peony seeds transcriptome within three developing stages, and we identified most of the genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. the assembled, annotated transcriptome sequences and gene expression profiles establish a basis for dissecting metabolic pathways involved in ufa and tag biosynthesis. it may provide new insights for the use of genetic engineering to increase the ala content of traditional crops as well as its breeding.

RESULTS
lipid accumulation at different stages of seed development
seeds of p. ostii at different developmental stages were harvested and flash frozen. the methodology validated in our previous study was applied to analyze the fa composition by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry at ten developmental stages  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  there were five dominant components, namely, α-linolenic acid , linoleic acid , oleic acid , palmitic acid , and stearic acid . the combined content of these five fas always predominated across the ten developmental stages at high percentages . the other four minor fas  were also detectable at trace levels including myristic acid , cis-11-octadecenoic acid , eicosanoic acid , and cis-11-eicosenoic acid . although the fa compositions and contents achieved in this study were not completely identical to the results of previous studies, the identity of the dominant compounds  and the high proportion of ufas were consistent  <cit> . additionally, the presence of γ-linolenic acid  was reported in the seed kernel and coat of p. rockii  <cit> , while it was not detected in other researches, neither in the present study. we had demonstrated that gla did not exist in the seeds of  <dig> tree peony cultivars by co-elution of gla and ala mix  <cit> , which was confirmed in this study due to lack of expression information of genes encoding for delta- <dig> desaturase through transcriptome analysis.figure  <dig>

the accumulation of major fas during seed development was examined, finding that fa contents varied markedly as seeds matured. ten developmental time points can be divided into three different periods, with low level of fas in the initial period , followed by a period of rapid oil accumulation , and a subsequent decline as seeds approaching full maturation  . total fas in p. ostii seeds increased almost continuously throughout developmental stages and reached maxima of  <dig>  mg g− <dig> at s <dig>  while, ufas—mainly ala, la, and oa—were major contributors to this notable increase . fa levels of the five major compounds increased uninterrupted during maturation, reached maxima at s <dig> and had a slight decrease at s <dig> . previous reports showed that the activity and abundance of β-oxidation enzymes were increased during seed dehydration and maturity, resulting in the degradation of storage oil and a loss of lipids  <cit> . the result was very important for guiding the optimum harvest time of tree peony seeds in order to obtain maximum yield of the oil. among all fatty acids, ufas dominated with relatively high proportions ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % during the course of seed maturation . it exhibited an extraordinary ala content in p. ostii, followed by la and oa . as seeds matured, ala content increased from an initial  <dig>  mg g− <dig> to  <dig>  mg g− <dig>  meanwhile, la and oa were maintained at relatively high levels and exhibited the same tendency as ala did during seed development .

illumina paired-end sequencing and de novo assembly
in order to explore the molecular mechanism of seeds development, lipids synthesis and accumulation in tree peony, six cdna libraries constituting two biological repeats were constructed from three stages of developing seeds   and sequenced using illumina high-throughput sequencing platform. the data sets from each stage were compared pairwise, and the correlation of duplicate samples was determined by the pearson correlation coefficient. the high pearson correlation coefficient, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , indicated high reproducibility between replica samples. we obtained a total of  <dig> million 100-bp paired-end reads from six libraries , encompassing  <dig>  gb of the sequence data for each library . after stringent quality assessment and data filtering,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads with a base quality score greater than  <dig> were selected and deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  short read archive . the gc contents of the six libraries were  <dig> %,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % and  <dig> % , respectively .table  <dig>

the de novo transcriptome assembly performed with trinity with default parameters, which was developed specifically for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  non-redundant contigs ranging from  <dig> to <dig>  nt long with a mean length of  <dig>  nt were obtained with a total length of  <dig>  mb . the size distribution of contigs showed that  <dig>  contigs  were longer than 1000 nt .figure  <dig>

characterization of the nonredundant unigenes of tree peony
of the  <dig>  nonredundant contigs, we tried to annotate possible open reading frames  and their further inferred protein sequences by the program getorf in the emboss package  <cit> . in total, the protein coding regions of  <dig>  contigs were predicted.

to annotate these genes, a homology search using the blastx program  revealed that  <dig>  ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   of the  <dig>  tree peony contigs had significant matches with sequences in the ncbi nonredundant, go, kog, kegg and uniprot protein databases, respectively. these genes were tentatively annotated according to the known sequences with the best match. altogether,  <dig>   genes were successfully annotated based on public databases, and the low annotation rate may be attributable to the limited genomic information for tree peony. the e-value distribution of the top hits demonstrated that  <dig> % of the unigenes had strong homology to previously deposited sequences , and  <dig> % ranged from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> . likewise, the species with the best match for each gene showed  <dig> % matches with that of vitis,  <dig> % with popular ,  <dig> % with castor bean , and  <dig> % with glycine max . it was in coincided with earlier studies, which fits nicely with tree peony being woody perennial  <cit> . while,  <dig> % genes less than 300 nt long, could not be matched to known genes , suggesting that the shorter sequences may lack a characterized protein domain or may be too short to show sequence matches, resulting in false-negative results. due to lack of genomic and transcriptome information from seeds of tree peony in databases, other genes longer than 1 kb  without hits may be considered putative novel transcribed sequences which is worthy to be studied in future.

functional classification of tree peony genes by gene ontology, eukaryotic orthologous groups, and kegg
functional annotation using gene ontology  terms was carried out using the blastp algorithm against the swiss prot and trembl databases by the gopipe program according to gene2go software   <cit> . altogether, a total of  <dig>  predicted proteins were categorized into  <dig> functional groups under three main divisions  . in the biological processes category, cellular process  and macromolecule metabolism  were the predominant groups, followed by nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism , response to stimulus , biosynthesis , regulation of biological process , and transport . in the cellular components category, cell  and intracellular  were the most representative ones, followed by cytoplasm , membrane , and nucleus . with regard to molecular function category, the predominant categories were catalytic activity  and binding , followed by protein binding , hydrolase activity , nucleic acid binding  and transferase activity . the distribution of genes in different functional categories in tree peony seeds were different from transcripts of flowers for reblooming and prolonging vase life due to the spatial and temporal characteristics of transcripts  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
functional classification of gene ontology annotation of tree peony unigenes. unigenes were assigned to three categories: biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.



to further evaluate the completeness of the transcriptome and the effectiveness of the annotation process, the annotated unigenes were compared with the eukaryotic orthologous groups  database for functional prediction and classification. in total,  <dig>  annotated putative proteins were classified functionally into  <dig> kog groups . among the  <dig> categories, “signal transduction mechanisms” represented the largest group , followed by transcripts associated with “post-translational modification, protein turnover and chaperones” . the categories “cell motility” , “extracellular structures” , nuclear structure  and “defense mechanisms”  represented the smallest groups. however, categories with no concrete assignment “general function prediction only”  accounted for a large fraction of transcripts.figure  <dig>

pathway-based analysis can further our understanding of the biological functions and interactions of genes. a total of  <dig>  genes were assigned to  <dig> pathways in the kegg database. the most represented pathways included “ribosome” , “biosynthesis of amino acids”  and “carbon metabolism”  . notably, some pathways were closely linked to changes in oil content and composition responsible for tree peony seed ripening, such as “fatty acid biosynthesis” , “biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids” , “α-linolenic acid metabolism” , “fatty acid elongation” , “glycerolipid metabolism”  and “glycerophospholipid metabolism”  . these identified unigenes for lipids provided critical clues to identify and characterize key functional genes involved in unsaturated fa and tag biosynthesis in tree peony seeds.

analysis of differentially expressed genes during tree peony seed development
tissues at 30 days after pollination  were served as the control, and a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were identified at  <dig> and  <dig> dap, respectively. among them,  <dig> unigenes were mutually present in both contrast groups, while  <dig> and  <dig> were specifically expressed only in the  <dig> vs  <dig> dap and  <dig> vs  <dig> dap groups, respectively .figure  <dig> 
venn diagram of transcripts  that were up- or down-regulated between seeds of  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap  and  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap . the “+” and “−” indicate up- and down-regulated transcripts, respectively. a total of  <dig> transcripts were significantly  expressed during developing seeds. 186: unique up-regulated transcripts in seeds of  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap; 619: unique up-regulated transcripts in seeds of  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap; 131: unique down-regulated transcripts in seeds of  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap; 831: unique down-regulated transcripts in seeds of  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap; 168: commonly up-regulated transcripts between seeds of  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap; 197: commonly down-regulated transcripts between seeds of  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap; 1: down-regulated in seeds of  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap but up-regulated in seeds of  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap.



there were  <dig> and  <dig> up-regulated unigenes in both contrast groups, respectively, while  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were down-regulated. among the up-regulated unigenes,  <dig> were co-expressed genes showing ≥2-fold expression difference , in contrast,  <dig> and  <dig> of the up-regulated genes were specific to each respective group. among the down-regulated unigenes,  <dig> were co-expressed genes showing decreases of at least 2-fold , whilst,  <dig> and  <dig> of the down-regulated genes were unique to each respective group .

differentially expressed genes  provide clues about the molecular events related to seed development. further investigation of degs may be warranted to determine the functional roles they played in the developmental tree peony seeds especially in the synthesis and accumulation of lipids. to evaluate the potential functions of genes that showed significant transcriptional changes between the two contrast groups,  <dig> differentially expressed genes with a gene ontology annotation were further classified into subsets. in terms of the categories, the two contrast groups showed similar patterns . these genes were related to  <dig> biological processes, including cellular process, macromolecule metabolism, response to stimulus, and metabolism. with regard to cellular components, the analysis revealed a high percentage of transcripts in the cell, intracellular, cytoplasm, membrane, and nucleus. the unigenes were finally classified into  <dig> categories based on molecular function, and the two most overrepresented groups were binding  and catalysis . to exploring the significantly enriched terms compared with the genome background, the hypergeometric test was used to map all degs in the go database. the results showed that most of the characterized topological modules were assigned unambiguously to at least one cellular function, including extracellular, external encapsulating structure, metabolism, response to stimulus, and oxidoreductase activity, etc. from the large datasets, we found that down-regulated genes were more abundant than those of up-regulated genes during tree peony seed development, which was in coincidence with genes during soybean seed development  <cit> . kegg functional enrichment analysis was performed to uncover their biological functions. the most represented pathways within contrast group  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap included xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism , biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites , cell growth and death , metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides , and lipid metabolism . in the contrast group  <dig> dap vs  <dig> dap, the most represented kegg pathways were carbohydrate metabolism , biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites , energy metabolism , xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism , amino acid metabolism , lipid metabolism , metabolism of other amino acids , and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides  . in this study, it was worthy to be mentioned that unigenes in the pathways responsible for seed oil biosynthesis included fa biosynthesis, biosynthesis of ufas, fatty acid elongation, glycerolipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism may provide valuable resource for the identification of unique genes involved in ala synthesis.

identification and characterization of genes involved in fatty acids and triacylglycerols biosynthesis in tree peony seeds
most enzymes involved in the lipid biosynthesis were identified in the tree peony seed transcriptome. in total,  <dig> unigenes implicated in fa biosynthesis and tag assemblage were identified . among the differentially expressed genes, more were down-regulated, and some showed a differential expression pattern between three contrast groups. pathway-based analysis helps to clarify the biological functions of genes. thereof,  <dig> genes were involved in the initiation and acyl chain elongation steps of de novo fa biosynthesis . most of these genes had at least one isoform significantly down-regulated in s <dig> compared with s <dig>  suggesting their functional involvement in the beginning of fa biosynthesis. the acetyl-coa carboxylase  catalyzed the first reaction to generate an intermediate malonyl-coa, which is a regulatory enzyme that controls, at least in part, the rate of fatty acid synthesis . it was reported that plastidic accase was the enzymatic target of feedback inhibition in tobacco suspension cells and brassica napus embryo-derived cells  <cit> . subsequently, repeated condensations of malonyl-acp with a growing acyl-acp chain were primed by fatty acid synthase  subunits, consecutively adding two carbon units to form 16:0-acp . unigenes comp <dig> and comp <dig> encoding kas ii  were highly expressed at s <dig>  which was consistent with the high proportion of 18-carbon fatty acids in tree peony seeds  <cit> . the fas generally terminated at saturated 16-carbon fatty acids in the plastid, which is catalyzed by palmitoyl-acp thioesterase  <cit> . unigenes comp <dig>  comp76036_c0_seq <dig>  and comp76036_c0_seq <dig> encoding fata and fatb were down-regulated more than 4-fold compared with that of s <dig> to s <dig>  in addition,  <dig> unigenes were identified to encode long-chain acyl-coa synthetases , and four unigenes encoded acyl-coa binding proteins , generating the er acyl-coa pool .figure  <dig>

in oilseeds, the major fate of newly synthesized fas is exported from plastids as acyl-coa to enter the glycerolipid synthesis  <cit> . triacylglycerols are the main components of storage lipids in oil seed plants, with the major constituents being 16- and 18-carbon fas. generally, tag can be synthesized through the sequential acyl-coa dependent acylation of a glycerol backbone , in which  <dig> unigenes were identified in tree peony seeds   <cit> . tag can also be formed in plants via two different acyl-coa independent pathways, catalyzed by phospholipid:diacylglycerolacyltransferase  and diacylglyceroltransacylase , in which dgta was absent in tree peony seeds  <cit> . unigenes encoding pdat had low transcript levels, implying that this route might not be a major pathway in tree peony seeds . in contrast, unigenes relevant to acyl editing, pe-dag and pc-dag interconversion were relatively active, which was believed to facilitate the incorporation of ufas into tag in tree peony seeds  <cit> .

among the  <dig> unigenes encoding phospholipases,  <dig> unigenes had relatively higher transcript levels . these unigenes may be related to the formation of membrane lipids and cell division. while, lipases that arose in developing seeds of castor bean was indicated to take part in remodeling of tags after synthesis  <cit> . totally,  <dig> unigenes encoding triacylglycerol lipase were identified from our libraries. the function of these genes in tree peony developing seeds needed to be further studied. in the mature oilseed, tags are stored in the form of small subcellular spherical oil bodies  <cit> . five unigenes encoding oil-body oleosins were identified with high expression level in developing seeds . unigenes comp <dig>  comp <dig>  comp <dig>  comp <dig>  and comp <dig> were of 2-fold to 16-fold up-regulation, suggesting their active involvement in oil accumulation in tree peony seeds. the above identified specific genes would provide clues to understand the molecular mechanism on oil accumulation of tree peony seeds.

most fas produced in the plastid were not immediately available for tag biosynthesis before desaturation. in tree peony seeds,  <dig> unigenes encoding fatty acid desaturase  were detected, including one unigenes for stearoyl-acp desaturase , nine unigenes for oleate desaturase  and eight unigenes for omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase  . there were no related unigenes encoding fad <dig> and fad <dig> detected in tree peony seeds. fatty acid desaturase is responsible for sequential modification of oa to la and ala. fad <dig> and fad <dig> remove two hydrogen atoms from oa to form la, while fad <dig>  fad <dig> and fad <dig> catalyze the conversion from la to ala  <cit> . however, most of them exhibited low expression levels across seed development, and only three unigenes were differentially expressed. thereinto, the abundant transcripts of comp <dig> and comp <dig> separately encoding sad and fad <dig> in s <dig> and s <dig> were consistent with the relatively high levels of oleic acid and its downstream products. the expression of comp <dig> encoding fad <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in s <dig> and then down-regulated  <dig> -fold in s <dig>  which indicated its correspondent function in ala accumulation. further cloning and functional analyses of the three genes would probably reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying ufas biosynthesis in tree peony seeds.

expression analysis of candidate degs related to seed development
we analyzed transcript abundance by qrt-pcr in tree peony seeds at three different developmental stages described in figure  <dig> . according to the genes annotated in kegg and the results of lipid biosynthesis obtained in many plants  <cit> , ten degs were selected for expression analysis . a reliable r <dig> correlation coefficient of  <dig>  was obtained between qrt-pcr and rna-seq results by linear regression analyses , confirming the validity of the transcriptome results.

to see if any correlations existed between ufa accumulation in developing seeds and expression patterns of desaturation genes, we analyzed transcript abundance of three related genes  by qrt-pcr from ten different developmental stages described in figure  <dig>  the three genes catalyzed the sequential desaturation of stearic acid at Δ <dig>  Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> position, generating oleic acid, linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, respectively. the results indicated that they were expressed across the seed development period, but the levels of expression varied considerably at different developmental stages . genes exhibited relatively low transcript abundance during initial development , and then their expression increased gradually  and dropped thereafter . the significantly high-level expression of fad <dig> than sad and fad <dig> after s <dig> was in agreement with the higher ala content than oa and la. specifically, expression of the desaturases sad and fad <dig> peaked in the s <dig>  consistent with the maximum oa and la contents observed in the seed oil at s <dig>  the reduced expression of both genes in later stages of seed development indicated a reduced accumulation of oleic acid and linoleic acid at s <dig> . the expression of fad <dig> was characterized by a bell-shape transcript curve, with low levels of expression at the initial stage followed by a substantial increase during the rapid phase of oil accumulation and a subsequent decline toward seed maturation. the similar gene profiles in brassica napus, arabidopsis and sea buckthorn were observed  <cit> . the high levels of fad <dig> transcripts during critical developmental period  coincided with the high number of reads obtained for this gene by illumina sequencing .figure  <dig>

discussion
ala exerts a wide range of biological activities  and prophylactic effects   <cit> . due to the high value and growing demand for ala, exploiting oleaginous resources and dissecting the mechanism of oil biosynthesis and ufa accumulation have been extensively studied  <cit> . recent years, tree peony is expectedly gaining popularity as a resource in food and nutraceutical industries. compared with traditional oil crops—soybean, rapeseed, peanut, corn, sunflower, etc., tree peony oil, with its high ala level  together with a near 3: <dig> ratio of n- <dig> to n- <dig> fatty acids, represents a very balanced source of polyunsaturated fatty acids for human health and nutrition. the medical and nutritional applications of tree peony oil warrant further exploration and it can be developed as important nutritional supplements for specific populations, weanling infants, preschool children, and pregnant and lactating mothers, etc.  <cit> . furthermore, the statistics indicate that the global oil consumption from oilseed crops was approximately  <dig>  million tons in  <dig>  <cit> . vegetable oil consumption is expected to double by  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, considerable research efforts related to the exploration of new oleaginous resources and oil biosynthesis in seeds are urgently needed, and it is believed to be a promising avenue for the next decade.

many plants deposit tag in seeds and fruits as the major form of storage lipid, which is stored in densely packed oil bodies  <cit> . the acyl-coa-dependent pathway catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase  is considered the major pathway for tag assembly in plants  <cit> . tag can also be formed by two acyl-coa independent acyltransferase   <cit> . the expression levels of genes encoding dgat and pdat were relatively low, while dgta was absent in tree peony seed transcript in this study. nevertheless, it was surprising that genes related to oilbody formation were still largely expressed. the characterized phenomenon has remained elusive since the temporal patterns of gene expression for the enzymes relevant to tag assembly are very different during seed development. so far, there is a fundamental lack of clarity about the regulation of gene expression and enzyme activity for these later steps in oil biosynthesis  <cit> .

the diversity of ufa composition in tag could be enriched by phosphatidylcholine  or phosphatidylethanolamine  acyl editing. pc-dag and pe-dag interconversion allowed acyl-coa newly exported from the plastid to enter pc or pe for fa modification, while desaturated fas depart for tag. alternatively, the acyl in dag was converted to pc or pe by dag-cholinephosphotransferase  and dag-ethanolaminephosphotransferase . the reversibility of this reaction allows the entire dag portion of pc or pe, including any modified fas, to participate in tag synthesis  <cit> . the vast majority of fas  within the seed flux through pc before incorporation into tag, suggesting that pc is a central intermediate in the flux of fas or dag, or both substrates into tag  <cit> . however, genes encoding dag-cpt were weakly expressed in our libraries, but it did not mean the inactivity of pc-dag interconversion. previous researches showed that saccharomyces cerevisiae ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity was capable of efficiently utilizing cdp-ethanolamine, cdp-monomethylethanolamine, cdp-dimethylethanolamine, and cdp-choline in vitro. this broad substrate specificity implied that ept <dig> gene product might synthesize both pe and pc in vivo  <cit> . additionally, pc also can be synthesized from pe by two rounds of methylation  <cit> .

desaturation is the key step that resulted in the desirable n- <dig> and n- <dig> fatty acids. arabidopsis thaliana mutants have provided the evidence that there are seven genetic loci, fad <dig>  fad <dig>  fad <dig>  fad <dig>  fad <dig>  fad <dig> and fad <dig>  in which fad <dig>  fad <dig> and fad <dig> encoded omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase  <cit> . generally, the contents of ufas were consistent with expression levels of genes for desaturases. genes in tree peony seed corresponded to those from the seeds of flax, sacha inchi and sea buckthorn, suggesting that the regulatory pathways involved in the fas biosynthesis are conserved. fad <dig> genes would be specifically expressed in perilla and sacha inchi seeds, in which ala accumulations were more than 50% of the total fatty acid contents  <cit> . in the sea buckthorn transcriptome, fad <dig>  fad <dig>  fad <dig>  fad <dig> and fad <dig> were expressed at similar levels, which was consistent with the 1: <dig> ratio of n-6:n- <dig> fatty acids  <cit> . these plant resources enriched in ala differed in the mechanism of fatty acid desaturation, signifying their unique metabolic pathways in the process of evolution  <cit> . fad <dig> and fad <dig> were highly expressed in tree peony seeds, indicating that fad <dig> and fad <dig> might play a vital role in the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. the verification of selected genes with qrt-pcr confirmed the changes, in which the relative expression level of fad <dig> was much higher than fad <dig>  we could deduce that the high content of ala in tree peony seeds was attributed to the activity and abundance of fad <dig> enzymes. further studies related to expression, substrate specificity or regulation of activity of enzymes related to fatty acids desaturation in tree peony seeds will shed light on the understanding of its special synthetic pathway, and simultaneously lay a foundation for the artificial regulation and molecular breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, lipid accumulation across developing tree peony seeds was monitored. our results indicate that tree peony oil can benefit human health in the long run owing to its high levels of α-linolenic acid  and a low ratio of n-6/n- <dig> ration . additionally, we report here the first transcript dataset derived by using high-throughput sequencing technology  for tree peony seed. transcriptome analyses from three developmental stages of tree peony seeds resulted in  <dig>  contigs. expression of  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes differed at least 2-fold in the  <dig> and 90 days after pollination compared to the initial stage, respectively. focusing on lipid genes, we identified  <dig> unigenes associated with the de novo fa biosynthesis, the formation of ufas, tag assembly and oleosin formation from tree peony seeds. these unigenes provide a comprehensive molecular biology background for researches on tree peony seed development, particularly with respect to the process of oil accumulation. in particular, those candidate genes  associated with ufa biosynthesis would provide critical clues to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the high levels of α-linolenic acid biosynthesis in tree peony seeds.
