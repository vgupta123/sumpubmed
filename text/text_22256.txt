BACKGROUND
regrowth of the peripheral nervous system  after injuries such as axotomy is associated with changes in the expression of extracellular matrix  molecules in the environment traversed by the regenerating growth cones  <cit> . these changes may promote regeneration in at least two different ways. first, by generating increased levels of molecules such as laminin  and fibronectin  that can promote neurite outgrowth in cell culture and are therefore likely to promote regeneration in vivo  <cit> . second, by altering the pattern of alternative splicing so as to switch from isoforms of ecm proteins expressed in adult nerve to those expressed earlier during a time of axon growth in development. an example of the second mechanism is provided by fn, whose primary gene transcript is alternatively spliced in three regions  <cit> . two of these include or exclude single fn type iii repeats  while the third partially or completely excludes a region  that contains a cell binding sequence leu-asp-val  recognised by the integrin α4β <dig>  <cit> . while these regions are excluded from adult fns in a cell and tissue specific pattern  <cit> , we have previously found that sciatic nerve injury and regeneration in the adult rat is associated with a change in the pattern of alternative splicing and the re-expression of embryonic fns that include all these regions  <cit> .

recombinant fns that include the entire v region promote neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion  neurons or pc <dig> cells  more effectively than those containing only the rgd sequence present in the 10th type iii repeat present in all fns  <cit> . as the α <dig> integrin subunit is expressed on regenerating growth cones in vivo, we have therefore proposed that the re-expression of embryonic fns following injury contributes to regeneration of the adult pns by enhancing α4β <dig> integrin signalling  <cit> . the identification of α <dig> integrins as part of the regenerative mechanism in the pns is of particular interest as these integrins play an important role in cell migration in other cell types  <cit> . the adaptor protein, paxillin, which binds directly to the α <dig> cytoplasmic domain, is an important downstream signalling molecule in this process  <cit> . transgenic knock-in mice expressing only α <dig> integrin with a y991a mutation within the paxillin binding site that blocks the interaction show impaired leucocyte recruitment during inflammation  <cit> . a physiological modification that blocks binding of paxillin is generated by phosphorylation of the α <dig> integrin cytoplasmic domain, detected in certain t cell lines using an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide containing phosphoserine at ser <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylation is localised to the leading edge of migrating cho cells  <cit> , and the reversibility of paxillin binding enabled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of α <dig> may be important for migration, as both s988a  and s988d  mutations inhibit migration in cell culture  <cit> . we have shown previously that paxillin is also associated specifically with α <dig> in drg neurons and pc <dig> cells  <cit> . this suggests the hypothesis that paxillin also makes an essential contribution to α4-mediated growth cone motility and pns regeneration by virtue of the association with the integrin cytoplasmic domain. here we test this hypothesis by examining the requirement for the α4-paxillin interaction in neurite outgrowth and find that the interaction is required; however, in contrast to non-neuronal cell migration, α <dig> phosphorylation is dispensable for neurite outgrowth.

RESULTS
to examine α4-mediated neurite outgrowth we used pc <dig> cells as model neurons. these cells do not express α <dig> integrin and transfection with α <dig> enables them to manifest neurite outgrowth on fn isoforms that contain the α <dig> integrin binding site  <cit> . to assess the requirement for paxillin binding to the α <dig> cytoplasmic domain for this neurite outgrowth, we first expressed α <dig> subunits into which alanine substitutions had been inserted into either or both of two amino acids essential for paxillin binding; glu <dig> and tyr <dig>  <cit> . as controls we expressed either full-length α <dig> or α <dig> lacking the cytoplasmic domain sequences c-terminal to the gffkr motif . to demonstrate the expected effects of these mutations on paxillin binding, we immunoprecipitated lysates of the pc <dig> cells with antibodies against the extracellular domain of α <dig> and then western blotted the protein complexes pulled down with anti-paxillin antibodies. as shown in fig 1b, the α <dig> subunits were all expressed in the pc <dig> cells but bound paxillin to differing degrees; while full-length α <dig> complexed with high levels of paxillin, α <dig> with either single mutation bound much lower levels and α <dig> with the double mutation showed virtually no binding. as expected, the α <dig> subunit lacking the majority of the cytoplasmic domain did not bind paxillin, illustrating the specificity of the assay.

to examine the effects of these mutations on α4-mediated neurite outgrowth, we then grew these pc <dig> cells on recombinant fn fragments containing the v <dig> region for  <dig> hrs. the extent of neurite outgrowth correlated with the degree of paxillin binding to the α <dig> cytoplasmic domain . either single mutation reduced neurite outgrowth while the double mutation resulted in a complete loss of α4-mediated neurite outgrowth, with the degree of outgrowth now being identical to the low level seen with wild type pc <dig> cells or with pc <dig> cells expressing the α <dig> subunit lacking the majority of the cytoplasmic domain. to ask whether this effect of perturbing paxillin interactions was specific for α4-mediated neurite outgrowth, we repeated the experiments with cells expressing wild type α <dig> or the double mutation on laminin, collagen or fn v <dig>  laminin and collagen bind to different integrins on the cell surface  and promote neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . expression of α <dig>  either wild-type or mutant, had no effect on this neurite outgrowth while, as before, only the cells expressing wild-type α <dig> showed enhanced neurite outgrowth on fn v <dig>  confirming that the loss of the paxillin association with α <dig> only perturbs α4-mediated neurite outgrowth.

to show directly that paxillin promotes neurite outgrowth in response to fn v <dig> substrates, we over-expressed wild-type or mutant paxillins in pc <dig> cells also expressing wild-type α <dig>  the structure of wild-type paxillin is shown in fig 3a, and the two different paxillin mutants used in the study are shown in fig. 3b. one lacks the ld <dig> domain that promotes neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells grown on collagen substrates  <cit> . the other has tyr to phe substitutions at tyr <dig>  tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  this prevents the phosphorylation of tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> implicated in cell motility  <cit>  but has no effect on neurite outgrowth on collagen  <cit> . western blot experiments confirmed that tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed in the triple mutant paxillin, whilst the wild type and ld <dig> deletion mutant forms were recognised by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody . to determine the relative expression levels of expressed and endogenous paxillin, we performed western blots using antibodies against paxillin  and against the flag-tag present only in the expressed form of paxillin. as shown in fig 3d, there were greater levels of the expressed paxillins than the endogenous paxillin, and the levels of the mutant paxillins were comparable with those seen with the wild-type construct . to confirm that the expressed paxillins associated with α <dig>  we western blotted using anti-paxillin antibodies cell lysates immunoprecipitated first with anti-α <dig> and then with the anti flag-tag antibody that detects only the expressed paxillin. all the expressed paxillins associated with α <dig> . notably the ld <dig> deletion mutant associated with the integrin, even though the critical residues for α <dig> binding have been shown to be present in an ala <dig> to asp <dig> fragment containing the ld <dig> and ld <dig> domains  <cit> .

next, we examined neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells co-expressing wild-type α <dig> and the different paxillins. in cells expressing wild-type paxillin, we found enhanced neurite outgrowth on fn v <dig> compared with cells expressing α <dig> alone . in keeping with the previous studies  <cit> , no significant difference in the extent of neurite outgrowth on fn v <dig> substrates was seen between pc <dig> cells expressing wild type and the triple tyrosine mutant paxillin, while the ld <dig> domain mutant supported neurite outgrowth to a significantly reduced extent . these over-expression studies therefore confirm a role for paxillin in promoting neurite outgrowth on fn v <dig> substrates. taken together with the studies above showing that association of paxillin with the integrin cytoplasmic domain is required for outgrowth, they show that the recruitment of paxillin by α <dig> integrin represents an important mechanism for neurite outgrowth on these embryonic fibronectins.

as outlined in the introduction, the binding of paxillin to the α <dig> integrin is inhibited by phosphorylation of ser <dig>  the temporal and spatial regulation of paxillin binding enabled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may have an important physiological role in cell motility, as both s988a  and s988d  mutations inhibit migration in cell culture  <cit> . in the final part of this study, therefore, we examined the role of phosphorylation of ser <dig> in neurite outgrowth on fn v <dig> substrates. we transfected pc <dig> cells with either wild type α <dig> or α <dig> with s988a or s988d mutations. as an additional control, we used a control s990a mutation that does not alter paxillin binding . all four α <dig> constructs were equally expressed in pc <dig> cells . wild type α <dig> was not phosphorylated in pc <dig> cells as judged by immuno blotting with a phospho-α <dig> specific antibody whereas it was heavily phosphorylated in jurkat cells  . in contrast, the α <dig> was labelled by this antibody in pc <dig> cells suggesting that this mutation is also phospho-mimetic with respect to recognition by this antibody. we confirmed the effect of these mutations on the binding of paxillin to the α <dig> cytoplasmic domain by immunoprecipitating α <dig> from lysates of cells expressing each of the four different α <dig> subunits and detecting paxillin by immunoblotting. as expected, no associated paxillin was seen with the phospho-mimicking s988d mutation, whilst all others bound paxillin as expected . lastly, we examined neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells expressing each of the four α <dig> subunits on fn v <dig>  as before, wild-type α <dig> promoted neurite outgrowth and this was not affected by the s988a or s990a mutations. in contrast, however, the s988d mutation that blocked paxillin binding showed no α4-mediated neurite outgrowth, as the levels of outgrowth were identical to those of pc <dig> cells not expressing α <dig> integrin . we conclude that mutations that mimic phosphorylation of ser <dig> will prevent paxillin binding in pc <dig> cells, and therefore inhibit the neurite outgrowth promoted by α <dig> integrin on fn v <dig> substrates. however, the lack of detectable phosphorylation of wild-type α <dig> in the pc <dig> cells and the efficacy of α <dig> in promoting neurite outgrowth suggests that the reversibility of paxillin binding enabled by phosphorylation of ser <dig> is not necessary for neurite outgrowth.

discussion
we have shown that the association of the adaptor protein, paxillin, with the α <dig> integrin cytoplasmic domain is required for α4-mediated neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells on embryonic fns that are expressed during nerve regeneration. in the absence of this association, the enhanced neurite outgrowth on fn v <dig> is lost. conversely, overexpression of paxillin enhances α4-dependent neurite outgrowth on this substrate. as alternative splicing of the fn primary gene transcript following pns injury increases the number of fns containing v <dig> in the regenerating nerve, and α <dig> is expressed on regenerating growth cones in vivo  <cit> , we suggest that the α4-paxillin interaction may play a key role in pns regeneration. the upregulation of different ecm molecules during pns regeneration suggests that other integrins will also contribute to regeneration. two candidates are α5β <dig>  that is also expressed on regenerating growth cones in vivo  <cit> , and α7β <dig>  a laminin receptor expressed on a subset of drg neurons and also shown to be required for normal regeneration of motor neurones in the facial nerve  <cit> . however, as α <dig> and the closely related α <dig> are the only integrin α subunits reported to bind paxillin directly  <cit> , it is likely that these integrins will activate different and parallel downstream pathways so providing an enhanced regenerative response triggered by the change in fn splicing.

the demonstration of a functional requirement for paxillin binding to a specific integrin to promote neurite outgrowth extends previous work on signalling within growth cones. paxillin is localised within neuronal growth cones within dynamic focal adhesions that assemble at the leading edge, enlarge and finally disassemble while remaining in place as the growth cone advances  <cit> . it becomes tyrosine phosphorylated on neurite outgrowth  <cit> . tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> provide a binding site for the adaptor protein crk  <cit> . overexpression of crk promotes neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells  <cit> , and also promotes cell motility in a bladder cancer cell line  <cit> . surprisingly, therefore, but in agreement with others  <cit> , we find no evidence that inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation by expression of a paxillin with tyr to phe mutations in these residues inhibits the ability of over-expressed paxillin to enhance neurite outgrowth. two other regions of paxillin have been implicated in neurite outgrowth signalling. first, ser  <dig>  that is phosphorylated by p <dig> mapk. this phosphorylation promotes outgrowth that can be inhibited by a ser to ala mutation in this position  <cit> . second, the ld <dig> domain within the leucine-rich domains, that provides a binding site for a number of other signalling proteins  <cit>  and deletion of which inhibits neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells growing on collagen substrates  <cit> . our results show markedly less neurite outgrowth following expression of the ld <dig> deletion mutant than full-length paxillin, suggesting an important role of the ld <dig> domain in α <dig> integrin-mediated neurite formation.

at least three possible mechanisms by which the ld <dig> domain might promote neurite outgrowth have been described. first, by the recruitment of the focal adhesion kinases fak and pyk <dig>  both of which interact directly with the ld <dig> domain  <cit> , are co-immunoprecipitated with paxillin in pc <dig> cells  <cit>  and are activated by interaction with the α <dig> cytoplasmic domain in t cells  <cit> . activation of these kinases occurs during growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells, and inhibition of their activity by expression of a c-terminal construct  blocks this outgrowth  <cit> . second, by recruitment of the arf-gap pkl. this in turn recruits the p21-associated kinase  via a linking interaction with pix  <cit> , and pak <dig> localisation to the membrane in pc <dig> cells has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth  <cit> , potentially via the activation of cdc <dig>  <cit> . third, by the regulation of the rho gtpase rac, as demonstrated by the prolonged levels of rac activation, loss of directional migration and randomly-orientated lamellopodia formation in cho cells expressing an ld <dig> deletion mutant of paxillin  <cit> . as expression of a constitutively active form of rac in pc <dig> cells promotes cell spreading but not neurite outgrowth, whilst dominant negative rac inhibits neurite outgrowth  <cit> , precise regulation of rac activity is clearly essential for neurite formation by pc <dig> cells.

directional cell migration is associated with high levels of rac activity at the leading edge of the cell  <cit> . a key question for future studies will therefore be the role of paxillin and α <dig> integrin in the spatial control of rac activity within the growth cone. the phosphorylated α <dig> integrins found in t cell lines will not bind paxillin  <cit> , and are localised to the leading edge of migrating cho cells, while non-phosphorylated integrins are found in the lateral edges  <cit> . as the α4-paxillin interaction inhibits rac activity and lamellopodia formation, the extension of cellular protrusions driven by rac and required for movement are therefore restricted to the leading edge of the cell and directionality of migration is achieved  <cit> . a mechanism by which the paxillin-integrin interaction reduces rac activity is provided by recent work showing that recruitment of the arf-gap git <dig> inactivates arf activity, which in turn results in decreased rac activation  <cit> . integrin phosphorylation therefore plays a key role in directional migration in some non-neural cells by providing a mechanism for the spatial regulation of paxillin dissociation from the α <dig> cytoplasmic domain.

CONCLUSIONS
peripheral nerve repair is associated with a re-expression of embryonic isoforms of fibronectin that contain a binding site for the α4β <dig> integrin. this integrin is expressed on regenerating growth cones and promotes neurite outgrowth on embryonic fibronectins in cell culture. using pc <dig> neuronal cells as a model system, we have shown here that the interaction of the adaptor protein paxillin with the integrin cytoplasmic domain is required for this outgrowth. we have also found that, in contrast to studies using t cells, there is no biochemical evidence for phosphorylation of α <dig> integrins in pc <dig> cells, suggesting that the dissociation of paxillin from the integrin mediated by this phosphorylation is either not required for growth cone motility or is achieved through different means. this points to potentially interesting differences between the mechanisms of two distinct forms of cell movement; directional migration in isolated cells and growth cone motility at the end of a cell process or axon.
